1,Believe the reviews,"Believe it all. this game is awful. The graphics are scary, and not only is there no dynasty mode, you are condemned to play the 00 season over and over again! So if you have a team you like, don't count on mixing it up with them. I read the reviews and figured I'd try it out anyway...if you are as into college ball as I am, stick to PS one games and save your $50."
2,upset baller,"This game was very disapointing.Only about half of the rosters are accurate and many of the players look like they're 40 years old.And another thing, my brother plays college ball he's 6'7"" and about 210 pounds with black hair.This game has him at 6'2"" 185 with blonde hair.But I would recommend not to buy this game.This game was definitely released way to soon.989 sports games are giving playstation 2 a bad name."
5,Tables are very versatile.,"These tables are very versatile, sturdy, and easy to move to different locations. I use them as food trays, extra desk space, computer space. Wonderful tables to have on hand."
4,good book for educational use,"This might be a good book for teachers looking for material in their classes gamedesign or gamedevelopment. It may also be a good book for selfstudy, if you have the discipline to do the exercises. You need to have played a lot of the classic videogames though, otherwise you might not be able to do the exercises, which are mostly about thinking about gamedesigns and making little designs or design alterations on existing games."
4,Explore the Lincoln behind the image; but all too short,"What were Lincoln's views on death, afterlife and religion? Did he really have a loveless marriage? Would things have been different if he and Jeff Davis had swapped places?Speculative thought, and some answers, are to be found in this new volume, along with a wealth of perspective of Lincoln in artwork.The reason I only four-starred this book is that the body copy of text, before the artwork appendices, is only about 160 pages. This book could have used at least 50, if not 100, pages of additional meat on his bones.AND, this is LINCOLN! It's not like that would have been that hard to do."
2,Used a text book in history class,"Kindle version, pictures in chapter nine not easily viewed. No page numbers which are important when writing papers for class."
5,First President appear on a Coin.....,"Attractively produced compilation with highest scholarship.... Boritt directs Lincoln studies at Center,(civil War) Gettysburg site. Has more than 60 pages illustrating portraiture of Lincoln, diverse forms. Mt.Rushmore,& tourist type statues- in NY, Abe greets girl who suggested he grow a beard. An 'abandoned' forlorn 62' statue stands at a closed campground,Charleston,IL. Best source for,trivia/folklore. More of same,short paperback,Gordon Leidner's collection,2001."
4,"Substance, not drivel, in this romance","From the moment of her birth, the stars and signs foretold that Zenobia, descendant of Cleopatra, would be blessed in love and in war.""Beloved"" takes place during the Roman invasions of Palmyra (in the Syrian region of the world). I don't know enough about history to know if this is accurate, but the story was good enough to keep me interested throughout. There are some tactical details which, surprisingly, tie in beautifully with the story of Zenobia's loves. Unlike many books of the romance genre, Zenobia's character is admirable not only for her beauty but for her intelligence. Sex notwithstanding, I would let an older teenager read this book.""Beloved"" surprised me because it was so well-written that it does not fall into a ""fluff"" category. This was a wonderful gift that was a good investment because I will read it again. I will seek out other books by Beatrice Small because I enjoyed this book so much."
5,A masterpiece of romantic fiction,"""Beloved"" simply IS the top of its genre. Bertrice Small's typewriter (which she was still using then, I believe) was sprinkled with fairy dust when she wrote this fictionalization of Zenobia's life. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to keep up this pace, and her last truly great book was ""Wild Jasmine."""
4,"Next to her latest offerings, this one is a masterpiece.","When I first read this book, I found the character of Zenobia to be extremely cold and unappealing, but since then I have given it another chance and have found that the story is tight, believable and very well told. Small's descriptions of the city of Palmyra are as always very beautiful and concise. This one is a little more violent than her earlier offerings (the very first scene kind of disturbed me a bit), but if you can get past that, you'll love this story."
4,"If you must read Bertrice Small, read this book","""Beloved"" is by far the best book Bertrice Small ever wrote. Its history may be suspect (but hey, it's romance), but the story is highly entertaining and not as sex-driven as a lot of her other works. Better than any of the Skye O' Malley books, I'd recommend ""Beloved"" and ""Adora"" to anyone."
4,"Zenobia, Our BELOVED Queen","It had me gasping at the gruesome scenes, it had me crying when Aurelian assasinated the Council of Ten (especially Zenobia's best friend Cassius Longinus). I loved Zenobia's courage (remember when they had her march through the streets of Rome nude?), spirit, and the fact that she only loved ONCE. Marcus Alexander vow was truly heartening. I found myself confused by Aurelian's character - at times I despised him and then he would do something kind . . ."
2,Cartoonish,"I bought this book looking for something a little bit lighter and racier than the usual historical fiction I enjoy regularly. I was sadly disappointed. The entire plot is engineered to create situations for sex (and sometimes poorly engineered - take the Unconquerable Sun episode as case and point). I did not find the sex provocative because the characters were so one-dimensional, and the setting so thin. The story of Zenobia Queen of Palmyra should be great material - but I got so little sense of the historical background and characters that the novel was almost cartoonish. If you are a lover ROMANCE, you may not be disappointed, but if you are a lover of the HISTORICAL, you are bound to be disappointed."
5,Oliver Review,Rozz Williams make a great project in the area industrial noise.A brilliant work!Listen this album!I think this is magnificent!
4,useful book,"This book is a comprehensive overview of lymphedema and related diseases. It is very easy to read and comprehend even for lay people. The book explains the causes of the diseases and provides very explicit guidelines for how to manage the given disease. For instance, it has a section with pictures explaining how to perform the special lymph massage that drains the lymphatic veins of their fluid. Another useful feature of this book is that it explains the difference between conditions that are very often confused with lymphedema, even by medical doctors, such as lipedema. It also covers venous disease of the blood flow which is a common complication of for instance lipedema. I would especially recommend this book to individuals who suffer from lymphedema or related conditions in order for them to learn more about exactly what is happening in their body and what the best treatment would be."
3,an OK necklace,"The necklace is OK. The chain is definitely nice-very delicate small links- the chain is essentially a choker, which isn't the most comfortable in a chain link. The pendant itself is extremely thin, with virtually no weight to it at all. I was expecting it to be a bit more substantial. The packaging was nice- it came in a navy blue velveteen pouch in a navy blue box- however the pouch was a poor choice of packaging because the chain was so tangled up it took forever to undo. It would have been nicer in a display box. Overall it was worth the money-but don't expect to be wowed."
4,Poke Power!,"This is an awesome read! It follows the games more closely than the anime, and gives you more of an insight into how the character thinks. Even though Red is much more intelligent and mature than Ash, you still get the vibe of immaturity, so you know that he's still just a kid who has a lot to learn.This issue was a personal favorite, as it has my favorite character from the anime and games, Misty!I definitely recommend this manga, and all the others in the series!"
4,It's Misty of Cerulean City!,"In this issue of Pokemon Adventures, Red and Misty travel through Mt. Moon, but on the way they run into Team Rocket, a strange organization who's bent on capturing other people's Pokemon. After that, Red and Misty arrive at Cerulean City, where Misty lives. Apparantly she lives in a huge mansion, and has a whole bunch of maids which Red falls instantly in love with. Unfortunately for him, he gets on Misty's bad side and causes her to challenge him, unexpectedly, to a Gym Battle. Soonafter, Red ventures off further into the Pokemon world, and runs into a freakish looking half-Pokemon half-human that calls itself 'Bill'. If you enjoyed the game, you should really get this issue of Pokemon Adventures, because you'll probably enjoy this as well."
5,ideal for every woman,"ladies, if you need to straighten out your man you need this cd ok. you need this in your life."
3,heard better,this is a decent jam not nothing to brag about but it'l get the girls hyped at the club.
1,Macrovision or Other,This CD is encoded with Macrovision or Other. Don't buy it. Get the labels to produce ERROR FREE recordings.
2,Dissapointing,"I bought this thinking it would be as good as the first Celtic Twilight album. I was very wrong. The songs are thrown together randomly and the whole CD lacks the depth and the flow of the first. Each time I listened to it, I was hoping it would get better, it just never did. I gave it 2 stars for a reason; the number of songs in the whole album actually worth listening to."
5,Fill in the gap between classes and on the job training,"For many of us, attending PeopleSoft classes are a luxury. Often technical manuals are not available at work. Maybe you're in between jobs or assignments and want to polish up certain areas of expertise that you haven't had an opportunity to work with recently.The Essential Guide does all this and more. I have taken PS 5.0 technical classes and worked with 7.5 for several years, but this is the first book that I have come across that fills the gaps on Tools I, II, Peoplecode, COBOL, and App Engine. You can't find this kind of information anywhere else. The only way to beat this book is to be able to sit down in a room with the original PeopleSoft developers."
4,Takes many PeopleTools Manuals and puts into one book,"While nothing in this book, is not found in the PeopleSoft training material for the particular topic, it does put it into one compact book. The chapter on Cobol was the most of interest to me, because this information is hard to come by. I compared to the internal documentation given to PeopleSoft consultants, and found this book to be much better. My only question is, when will the PeopleSoft 8 version of this book be released. Also, more information on running PeopleSoft in the OS390 DB2 environment would be very good. I usually work in this area, since it is hard to find consultants that can perform in this arena, and the larger customers tend to use DB2 on big iron."
5,A blessing!,"A friend sent me this book when she learned of my miscarriage. It helped me deal with the various aspects of the grief. I loved how the author shared her personal story and gave excersises to do at the end of each section. In the scrapbook I made for my angel Isaac, I included this book as one of my diamonds in the dessert. I came to this site to order the book for a friend of mine who just lost a baby. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has lost a baby."
1,Narrow splendors,"Given the myriad of restrictions on humanity imposed by Islam this book manages to find some splendors. Art is virtually prohibited with the exception of architecture as Mohammed declared ""image makers"" unholy. In addition to elimination painting and sculpture, dance is made impossible by ""modestry restrictions"" as is sport. Polyphony was developed in the West so musical forms are quite limited.What is left is covered with some skill by this book."
4,A Surprising Pleasure,"With the hokey cover to this book, I had expected to be disappointed. Instead, I was very pleasantly surprised! This book takes the reader on a rollicking adventure to the old west. This could have been very corny, but the author does a good job making the tale credible. I really enjoyed the humor interspersed throughout the story. Clearly, the author had fun writing this book. Having read a lot of Sherlock Holmes pastiches, I was pleased to find that the author kept true to the characters of both Holmes and Watson, while developing them both a bit more. Unlike one of the other reviews, I did not find the relationship between Holmes and Sarah to be jarring. Rather, I found it credible. Holmes still managed to be rude and superior. He wouldn't be Holmes if he weren't."
4,Action packed fun,"I've read Sherlock Holmes goes to america books before, but none like this. All I can say is it was a fun read, packed with humor, action and a hint of romance that stayed true to the characters natures.There was humor throughout the book, yet it was never farsical.The action never stopped and kept the book flowing along at a fast pace. My favorite bit was when they were prisoners in the indian camp.The romance showed a softer side to Holmes. Showed that he could have human feelings, but of course, being Holmes, he would never act upon them. I was particularly pleased about that because I hate books where Holmes goes all mushy. It was totally believable that he could fall for an accomplished, intelligent and capable woman, and even more believable that despite that he wouldn't dream of acting upon those emotions. I thought it was well done.All in all a really good read. I'm eagerly hoping this author will write more books."
5,Works great!,"Received on-time, with no problem installing the shocks. They are working as advertised, on pavement and off-road! Price was comparable to other ttypes of shocks."
5,cute stories!,"This was full of cute short stories. Definitely stories that kids and really anyone should know, they almost all had a moral. And it was free! You can't beat free!"
2,Not for a child - maybe a teen,"Far too long and involved for my 10 and 11 yr. old grandchildren, even read over the course of three evenings. These are children who are used to myths and legends but they still could not pay attention to this."
4,Interesting.,A different take from Fairy tales that we learned as children. I will send my son a copy so he can read the stories to my Granddaughter.
3,Okay,The book is just fine but not what I expected. It isn't really a children's book. I expected a cute and funny book children could read and laugh. This isn't that book.
5,Perfect book for those new to alternative/complementary care,"Scott Key has written the most ""readable"" book yet for those wishing to be introduced to alternative/complementary health care. Written in a very readable, easy to understand style, this book, unlike many which focus only a one or two topics, manages to provide one of the most comprehensive treatments ever on the subjects of mental, physical, and spiritual health.Whether your interests lie with Western, Eastern, traditional, or alternative health care, Scott's honest, sincere and personal approach to the subject of ""Radiant Health"" allows the reader to pick and choose among a variety of topics.This book will leave you feeling uplifted and empowered!"
3,A Taster For People New to Cleopatra Records,"This album was released as a compilation by Cleopatra Records to draw music fans to the label and its large catalog. Cleopatra was always known as a ""goth"" record label but, as this album proves, they did have some diversity in the artists they signed. They are not all goth or industrial bands but most of them are so if you don't like that type of music then skip this cd. Like any compilation of this type, there are some good, some decent, and some bad songs. And there are a couple of really great songs. If you are new to the goth or industrial genre and want a good taste of the ""best"" it has to offer, then skip this cd."
4,This will be the best dictation program available!,"This is truly a piece of amazing software! Even better, further improvements are expected in a very short period of time. No other software developer has ever been so responsive to the comments and needs of their users. I need an accurate and fast dictation system for my professional activities, and iListen has rapidly become the best solution. The recognition is as good as the competing product, and the ability to add your own vocabulary will put this product far out in front of the competition. IT'S GREAT!"
5,iListen does it good,"I purchased iListen to try out a Digital Recorder, (I have the Olympus DS-330). I'm runnning iListen 1.5.2 on Mac OS X 10.2.1.It works great for Direct Dictation, and once I figured out I had to create a different profile for the Olympus, accuracy jumped up there too.Really cool product, buy it!!!"
1,"desparately needed, but not there yet","Product worked for a few minutes, then crashed repeatedly on new, loaded iBook."
5,great item but you can get it at Staples for a lot less,This is a great item but can be obtained for a lot less elsewhere. sorry Amazon.
4,great for a 21st b-day,i gave this to my sister in law for her 21st birthday- it seemed appropiate and i think she loved it or at least thats what she said
4,Great Questions To Keep A Conversation Moving!,"This book has really helped me keep the phone conversations with my boyfriend moving. He is in the military, it's long distance, and these questions... while serious... really give us something to talk about. We make it fun and lighthearted, so it works for us!If you're thinking about buying this book because you want to ask questions of your lover and get to know them better, buy it! You won't be disappointed. It's helped me to get to know another side of my boyfriend, and it's really helped us to stay close while he's away.There are a lot of good questions, some sort of redundant ones, and some that might be a little too person for you to ask. But if you are open to talking about all aspects of love and sex, then it's perfect for you. It's small and easy to read!"
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for a book to start conversations with my husband. Instead, this book has questions like #72: Have you ever had sexual thoughts about members of your own family? If so, how did you handle those feelings?Are they trying to snuff out pervs? What kind of question is that?!?"
2,Great book if you don't know how to ask questions,"I didn't expect this to be a conversation starter book. It just gives you a whole bunch of ""what if"" questions. I do well at that on my own. If I were advising a friend about this book I would say, the book is a waste of shelf space. They did labele the book right ""The Book of Questions"" I just thought there would have been a little more to it. One of the frist questions is what if I were to get pregnant, they don't get much better throughout the book. I might even call it the book of starting fights because you know your not going to like some of the answers you receive."
4,A good way to make sure you are on the same page... long term,Ever wondered where your partner stood on major issues that may effect you in the long term???? This is a fun way of making sure you are really the people you think each other are. Its amazing what you can learn about each other.
4,Great Book of Questions,"As it should be obvious from the title, this is a book of over 250 questions on the topics of love and sex. The questions are very thought-provoking and some questions have follow up questions in the back of the book so you can explore the topic some more.I have used this book as a game with my girlfriend. We would pick a number and the other person would read the question. Then, we would both answer the question. It really is great when used in this context as you learn a lot about the other person. It helps people open up also, if you are on the reserved side. Of course, the book can be used alone as well.I will say that if you do the above and ask with your girlfriend/significant other be advised that some of the questions are very deep, and may be a little ""odd"" to ask if you are in the very early stages of a relationship. If you both agree, you can simply skip over the more in depth questions."
4,"Meant as a mindless party piece, but useable for age appropriate discussions",Useful conversation starters. We use this in a group level setting to prompt discussions about HIV and STDs.
2,Disappointing,"I was excited about this book, I thought there would be some good insight and tunes. I thought I'd learn the book's chord melodys - play through em etc... I was wrong.What you do get is some methods for playing solo guitar (the reason its not 1 star) and some lame chord melody arrangements.What makes them lame you ask?Well the voice leading isn't that good, the fingerings are hard to play and the chords used are mainly vanilla. What I was looking for was Galbraith but I didn't know it then."
5,"Not Gospel of John, but close","My kids LOVE Gospel of John. This wasn't the exact same format, but close. They thought it was ok, but not like the other."
1,Using this rebounder hurts!!,"I purchased this item with high hopes as it seemed to be a good value compared to the other rebounders out there. WRONG!!!! After using for a few days all my joints hurt and my back is killing me. There are no springs but stretch bands. It's too tight of a mat with a hard, jarring bounce. I brought mine back and purchased a Needak which is on the way. Read up on rebounders and you'll find out why cheaper quality ones can actually hurt your body and create nerve damage."
5,A jogger's delight,Bought this over a year ago. Didn't attach the pole and removed the blue rim for a wider mat and so I wouldn't risk trapping my foot under it. I feel more refreshed than bushed now after a good jog rain or shine. **NB. Just be sure to view the 'how to open' section on the dvd before you try to open the folded mini-trampoline. It is easy to do IF you view the dvd. You could hurt yourself otherwise.
2,Not stable,"The legs for this jumper did not fit well and would easily come off, which causes a great danger when working out. The stability bar was also very flimsy and would easily fall out of the socket. I would not reccommend this product because the one I received was not safe."
4,Karmacanic - Sophmore Release Is Better Than The First One,"""Wheel"" is the second album released under the Karmakanic moniker. This one seems to be much more of a band effort rather than simply a solo project for Flower Kings bassist Jonas Rheingold. Former Flower Kings drummer Zoltan Csorsz is still here, but the rest of The Flower Kings basically just serve in guest spots on a few tracks. The band, on this one, is a four piece with vocalist Goran Edman and guitarist Krister Jonzon rounding out the lineup. Overall I think this is a better album than the bands debut. The album covers similar musical territory with all of the musicians turning in top notch performances. The album is a mix of progressive rock vocal pieces and instrumentals. The two instrumentals on the album ""Do U Tango?"" and ""Hindby"" are both very good. The vocal tracks are all solid as well. If you like The Flower Kings, The Tangent or other similar bands you would probably eat this up."
1,CD Wouldn't Play,"I opened this CD & immediately put it in my CD player and it wouldn't play the first track. I fooled around with it for a while, there were several tracks that wouldn't play on my known-good (but 90's vintage) CD player.I suspect this CD came with Sony's copy protection scheme that does not allow it to play on many CD players. Well Sony, worked great, I couldn't play it!I returned it to Amazon, no hassle, instant refund."
4,"gone, but not forgotten","always considered to be firmly in the minor leagues Play dead , for me were a rare jewel in the otherwise murky world of goth. This compilation is an excellent intro to the band and recants a very productive period in the bands development,For their finest work check out ""company of justice"" their final lp/cd , which is without doubt a monumental collection of classic goth. For those interested the band have an excellent web page , that fills in the gaps on a band who never really gained the acclaim that they so surely deserved."
2,Time well wasted,"This book was written to take up the time of the everyday student. Because of poor grammar and lack of logical ways of wording sentences, it takes twice the time to understand what the author is trying to say. The cases, however, were helpful in understanding the material presented in the chapters."
5,Team Buddies Rules!!!!,"I think Team Buddies is a great game. Because it has a lot of action. It also has cool wepons. For example, Lightning grenades, Flame thrower, one of the strongest guns the Pulse Cannon and much more!!!! There are over 60 levels. Great two player game.There are so many different kinds of *Buddies* you can be like Ninja, Cyborg, and even Super Buddie!!The levels are action packed with blasting fun. Great gameplay. The game has very chalenging levels. Espesially the last levels. You can also drive Tanks, Hover Crafts, Air Planes and some more fancy wepons. Well thats all if you think you are good enough to beat this game without CHEATS!!! which is very hard for some people well not me! then buy the game and try it. Because its Fun."
4,Not bad at all.,"I run sound for live shows and am starting my own stuidio. Used high end and cheap mics of all kinds. So pleas know that low price, dosent always mean low quality. What I would like different would be a more solid point where the mic can pivot on a mic stand. Feels like it will break if i am rough with it. But other than that, if you have a decent preamp in your board, and use a decent cable. You will get a good sound from this mic. I use it mostly on my bass drum almost against the head with a second mic out a bit. really gives the detail of the smack i like in my kick drum. So for the price it's awsome. Just as the product it's self, i would put it just below the akg egg."
5,I am reminded of how good Bellman's book is by not having it with me now.........,"I am reminded of how good Bellman's book is by not having it with me right now......... My copy is in another continent, and the Univ So Paulo library is closed Sundays. And the full text is not online. So I have to wait. That gives me more time to appreciate Bellman's book - and the work habits of North American librarians as well. Together with Arnold's Ordinary Differential Equations, one of the must-have books on the subject.Every decent text has the dry facts. But keep copies of Bellman and Arnold handy to really understand the concepts, and to be able to do creative work using them."
2,Too few examples,"I bought this book as an aid to a differential equations course I had as an undergrad, and I found that it was lacking in sufficient examples. The text itself was easy to follow and logical, but the derivations of the equations and finding the solutions to the diff eq's were rather brief with few intermediate steps. It does, however, explain the applications of the mathematics to other fields such as physics, engineering, even biology. It even includes a few computational computer programs to illustrate the applications in computer science. It was an ok book to read, but was weak in the area of ""teaching from the blackboard."""
2,Modern Elementary Differential Equations,"I found this book too steep for my abilities. I was attracted to its small size, for I hoped that this would provide an easy way to understand DE's. However, I should have remembered what Pythagoras told the anxious king: ""There is no royal road in mathematics."" This book is a case in point. The reason for its brevity are that its demonstrations are terse, and it provides only occasional answers to the problem sets. Moreover, I find it asumes that the reader is an astute mathematician.The book might serve as a good refresher (see other review comments), but not a sufficient introductory text for someone with no previous experience in DE's or at the very least, someone who does not have a strong mathematics background. I gave this book 2 stars and not 1, only because part of the problem might be me. I believe I will do much better with Schaum's book on differential equations in their Outline series--a much bigger book, of course."
2,Thumbnails,"I bought a print of one of the postcards by Harrison Fisher as a wedding gift and purchased this book hoping that it would include a biography of Fisher and full or at least half page illustrations of the postcards for my friend. No such luck. Except for a very few large illustrations, most of which are not of his best work, the images are all thumbnails of 2x3 inches.Disappointing."
1,Poor quality and not supported,"This product reacted normally once (though I do not know about the actual surge suppression). In subsequent uses, it caused a short circuit in 2 different hotel rooms in 2 separate cities, tripping main breakers and cutting power to the entire room as soon as plugged.Two emails to the manufacturer (one to customer service and the other to technical support) were neither acknowledged nor answered."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I'm very pleased with this book. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect or how friendly it would be for a plant-based diet, but there are quite a number of vegetarian recipes (or vegetarian options) in the book and I'm pretty good at subbing for a variety of meats, so I'll actually be able to try the majority of the recipes in this book.The regions focused on are Mexico, China, France, and Italy. The recipes are simple enough for children without compromising quality of finished product (example: the author teaches you how to make your own beans rather than opening a can, so there is a focus on using whole/fresh ingredients). There is a lot of good information about food, cooking, and safety. There is a large, attractive picture of almost every recipe and line illustrations of how to do certain steps that may be unfamiliar.I think the book is at a level appropriate for about 9 and up. I have been cooking for years and I learned new things!"
5,Fantastic Cookbook for Kids,"This is a great little cookbook for any kid that shows an interest in cooking. I was worried the recipes might be too juvenile (I was thinking along the lines of Rice Krispies treats and the like), but no worry. The recipes are an international mix, coming from Mexico, France, China, and Italy. Most are classics like egg rolls, roast chicken, and French onion soup. There are a few more adventurous options like swordfish pasta. We tried the tortilla soup and thought it was excellent. The spiral binding is perfect for use in the kitchen.Because of the level of complexity of some of the recipes, I would recommend this book for early teens instead of the very young crowd. A great gift for any aspiring chef!"
4,Better Aimed at Adults,"The International Cookbook for kids is a great asset to my cookbook collection-although I'm an adult. I can see where tips would be useful to kids, such as safety and essential ingredients for the kitchen. The recipes instructions are broken down nicely with info. about the dish, ingredients, prep and cooking. I found many things useful, even though I've been cooking for years. But I don't know any child that wants to make Swordfish or Roast Pork with dried Plums. These kind of recipes are more sophisticated then the typical kids cookbook. These aren't recipes my kids are interested in learning. That being said...it is a a very nice cookbook to try new recipes and learn. It's just not kid kind of recipes. Here are some recipes that look good to try:Homemade Vegetable Stock-Something I've always wondered how to makeEgg RollsCold Sesame NoodlesZucchini with Corn and TomatoesStir Fried Orange ChickenBacon and Egg Custard Tart"
2,Not great,"This book is ok. The recipes are good, difficult, but seem tasty. My children and I both would prefer more pictures and definitely in color."
5,Great cookbook,"The comment from my 12 yr old grandson (maybe someday chef) was, ""Its great, Grammy!"""
3,Industrial Wasteland,Clause Larsen's best and owner of the industrial music genre.His other releases have yet to archive this cd's sonic palette.
3,Ok But Not The Thunderpuss Remix,"Simply stated the remixes here are ok, but the Thunderpuss Remix is missing from this CD and that is the track that is most sorely missing."
3,"Catchy, but not meaningful","Brooke Allison has an incredible voice. Her song ""the kiss off"" has a catchy beat, tune, and lyrics. Quite possibly the next thing in the music industry, or at least the next big act for Nickelodean. Brooke Allison has everyone that appeals to the pre-teen through adult age group. Though she maybe trendy, her song doesn't exactly have a deep purpose or meaning. Either way the song is decent."
5,"Clever, Catchy, & Creative","The Kiss-Off (Goodbye) is one of the best pop songs I've heard so far. The chorus is awesome, and the AOL sounding ""goodbye"" is a clever twist. Brooke has a very powerful voice for someone her age, much like fellow pop princess Christina Aguilera. I hope Brooke, one of the only great teenage pop singers, will continue to release new material, and save us from other overated teen artists."
1,Watch up... Dangerous!!!,"First I need to say, that it is what you pay for... This is a cheap product with a cheap performance. In addition to that, please take care because the ink drops ruining all it stains.Bottom line, you might want to spend double the money and get something that works and does not ruin your shoes, and carpet. Please do not get me wrong. I buy many cheap stuff that works as cheap as they are, but, at least they do what they are meant without harming any other thing. This is cheap marker that does not mark well enough, and ruins your things,The reason I give this marker 1 star is because it is not possible to give 0 stars to it. (-1 star would be accurate)Regards, and take care."
3,HUGE markers,I bought these markers to help organize our move. I was able to write large print and not have to trace back over the lines to make them visible. It made the move easier to organize and we were able to unpack the correct boxes in the correct rooms. Nothing like pulling out pots and pans in the master bathroom. Great help!
5,great marker,great marker that does what it's supposed to. it won't stink up the room either. i work in a warehouse and have to label hundreds and hundreds of boxes and this product is continuing to work very well.
5,Works like a charm!,"Works very well as advertised! I run it on an iMac G4 flat panel, OS X Panther.My LaCie model was pre-formatted in HFS+, so I literally: 1) unpacked it; 2) plugged in power; and 3) plugged in FireWire 400 cable. Drive mounted and displayed immediately. It's been drag 'n drop ever since! I have not experienced any issues mentioned in previous LaCie reviews.I would recommed this product (for Mac users--I have not tried it with a PC) without hesitation. It exceeded my expectations."
5,Great cookbook!,"A great book for diving headlong into cooking and meal planning for cancer patients! Lots of great, tasty recipes and information"
2,"Good toothbrush, but not worth buying","The toothbrush itself is excellent. Solidly built, with pretty much perfect waterproofing of both the brush and the charging stand (it charges by electromagnetic induction, I'd guess). It has a good, solid feel, not chintzy or clumsy like a lot of the cheaper units. And it does the job well.So why only two stars? Turns out Conair has discontinued it, and you can't get more brushheads by any means other than phone order direct through Conair. They waived shipping costs, so I stocked up, but there won't be many more to get.So while I like this better than anything else I've seen out there, I wouldn't buy it again, and I wouldn't recommend you buy it either."
1,Cheep Imitation,This is not a product I would recommend. It runs out of power quickly and Takes a long time to recharge. It works is only positive thing I can say.
3,"Great sountrack, terrible CD!","The soundtrack is amazing, however beware! The EMI release of the Good Bye Lenin soundtrack is copy protected!! (In other words, you will not be able to transfer these songs onto your iPod and some CD players will not play the disc.)"
4,Great music,"You can enjoy the music more if you have seen the film and can connect the melodies with the scenes. In fact there are a few melodies and there are several varations of each in the disk. The piano pieces are great and when accompanied with the archestra, they are even better. Soft and relaxing."
2,Yann Tiersen- stealing his own music??,"Didn't anyone else notice in the film that Yann Tiersen has used the exact track from Amelie entitled ""La Valse d'amelie (piano version)"" for the scene in Goodbye, Lenin when they are driving through the countryside after the mother has cofessed the truth about how the father left?? it's the exact same track!Why has Tiersen stolen from his own music? Did he really have so little time/energy/creativity??Besides this fact, his music is usually beautiful."
5,Order this copy from UK Amazon website,"I ordered the 23-track version from Amazon.co.uk two days before Christmas and received it in less than two weeks. It costs a little less than 23 USD after shipping.I also saw some sellers from the States trying to sell their 23-track version on the UK site, which I find to be a bit strange since no one is selling it through the US Amazon site."
4,By this one...,"After reading the reviews about the more extensive import version I decided that the import was a shopping goal in my recent (Aug 2007) German trip.I found it in a music store - and it was this version - not the other longer one. And the store receipt labeled it as ""new version"". So I think the import you can get now is the same as the domestic.To bad but more nice music by Mr. Tiersen."
3,i got the wrong cd,"i received the wrong cd (same problem as Paul in NJ ""Paul"") and have become very frustrated. i have been tempted to just keep this one, although i don't think there is a way for me to get the price difference back. ah well..."
4,Music of the Damned,"Fantastic set of extras and other rarities from the most obnoxious group of punk prototypes. ""Tales"" is staight from the bowels of late seventies, early eighties, english dirty punk. A few tracks are taken from another of the Damned's ep.'s, ""Friday the Thirteenth Ep."" The disc features a cover of the Rolling Stones song ""Citadel"" and the track ""Over the Top"" features ageing fart rocker Lemmy from the group Motorhead, who manned bass for a short while in the group. The Song entitled, ""The Limit Club"" excercises the groups ""goth"" styling and I think proves why this band surpassed all other early punk outfits in the arena of great music."
2,Just a Toy,"Do not buy the Winn Expandable if you are looking for a briefcase with character. Although the quality was acceptable, the glossy finish gives the case a 'toyish' feel and I found myself reluctant to be seen in public with it. I promptly returned it and waited a few days for a nice deal to show up on ebay (I found Hartmann, Korchmar, and vintage Coach hard attache cases in the same price range). If you are a snob, you will not be satisfied with the purchase. Who else but snobs buy silly briefcases anyway?"
5,Excellent,I bought this as a fathers day gift for my dad and it was exactly what I wanted. Very nice and classy. Arrived very quickly. Its strong and well made. Excellent product and I'd recommend it.
3,Good helper,"I would have prefered the book was laid out like the photo. However, it is not and the corresponding example is behind the problem you are working on."
1,a waste,"This book does not adequately prepare anyone for the actual exam, which consists of more research material comprehension and translation than the basic material offered in the book. The format of the gsflt is not even addressed, nor are there any actual sample questions or explanatory answers from the exam. The book just has test questions that does not pertain to the exam and at the back of the book there are some vocabulary and conjugation rules."
2,Not better then the 1976 version but it ain't THAT bad either!,"What is missing in the 2006 version of this film is the creepiness that the 1976 version had.First off the guy who played Manson did a good job. I give him that.The girl who played Sadie I wanted to smack the smirk off her face.Where was the court scene? There was no court scene. In the 1976 version those court scenes were magic.Also the scene where Sharon, Voytek, Steven, Abigail, Leno and Rosemary (The victims) were a bit too graphic for me. I almost threw up seeing Abigail getting stabbed to death. I couldn't bare seeing the Sharon character getting killed.It's an OK movie but not beter then the 76' version."
2,Dis-information and Mis-directed,"Very inaccurate film that makes Linda Kasabian more innocent than she was and ventures into areas that are almost insulting (allusions to Sharon Tate plans to cheat on Polanski while she is pregnant).This version makes no effort to capture the era with set design, dialogue, and even worse the abysmal soundtrack making it seem like a cheap attempt to sell DVD's with the fascination of true crime films based on serial killers (Fincher's ZODIAC being the only top rate film among them)The Van Bebber film is still the best FILM RE-ENACTMENT of these events. The only thing his version lacked was hiring better actors (which seems to add more character to his version and that is something that is required for this subject)and that is the only thing this film has going for it. Casting Jerry (her last name eludes me at the moment) from MR.SHOW as Squeeky Fromme is genius and the only thing that prevented a 1 star review."
1,I really didn't care for it,"its only my opinion but I didn't care for it no action, mostly talk of people talking about him and you never hear his side, but as I stated it's only my opinion every one got one."
3,DIVIDED OPINION,"Well this clearly divides opinion. 1st of all Davis does a pretty good job potraying Manson.Unfortunately the 1st scene at Hinmans is historically wrong, do you keep to the book even when you know some of the facts in that book are incorrect.As for the motives the Directors/writers duck out of this, you can tell they dont fully believe in the helter skelter motive.There is absolutely no conviction in the script. The way the film ends is a disappointment-there isnt much depth to the characters at all.Overall its clear the people involved either didnt really understand what happened in 1969 or what led up to it or decided to take the easy way out and not even go there."
1,"Wow, this DVD is utter $hit.","The writer director of this piece of filth took an amazing story with a very rich history and turned it into a shat out TV dinner. It was absolutely horrible. I kept hoping for a commercial interruption and remembered it was on DVD. The acting was abysmal. Absolutely horrendous. Charles Manson's life and times are almost hypnotic in their base interest. How then could I be checking my watch ever 2 or 3 minutes to see how much longer I had to watch? At one point I swear, the clock actually ticked backwards. Don't buy this, don't rent it, don't borrow it. AWFUL!"
1,Fight the Good Fight by Opposing Unnecessary Remakes,"People, let us keep in mind that in addition to not being very good in its own right, that this TV movie's greatest sin is that they are ripping off one of the greatest made-for-TVs ever and had absolutely nothing new to add to the story.In fact, simply by casting milksop Jeremy Davies as Manson shows that no one involved with this remake had any idea what Vincent Bugliosi was communicating about Charlie in Helter Skelter (ranking with TC's In Cold Blood as our paramount true crime stories).Just one of many sins committed in this rip-off. Let us hope someone with some idea of Manson Family values will make a documentary/update of this story. It is obvious from the reviews and rating of the remake that someone needs to do it."
1,Helter Skelter is all higgldy-piggldy,"Saw the film when it hit the airwaves and thought it was a bloated, overgrown mess full of emoting and flatulent performances. The script was derivative, the acting unoriginal, and it simply dragged on into a big 'ole mess.Rent the original, skip the mini-series."
1,This movie isn't good.,"I don't really care about staying true to the Manson story or any of that. I care if a movie is interesting and engaging, and this film inspires nothing but boredom.If you need to put a crying baby to sleep at night, play this film (minus the stabbing scene, though); otherwise, skip it."
2,Why do they always screw up movies?,"I liked the original much more.In the original version, they played the hard-rockin' Beatles song ""Helter Skelter"" during the killings. That was chilling, and fit perfectly. I haven't seen the original in a long time (shows how it sticks with you), but I also believe they played other White Album Beatles songs as well, such as ""Piggies"". Perfect!"
4,"It doesn`t surpass the 1976 outing, but...","still this product shows us the brutality of Manson first hand. In 1976, the tv-film gave us a chilling insight into intelligent madness - yup who can deny that the brain of Manson in not unlike Hitler; mad, but with vision and control of the environment.....In this version we get to know the victims... they`re no longer just names and figures... The last scene in which Sharon whispers ""Cut the baby"" to Susan Atkins never happened, but she d i d try to negotiate with her killers; ""take me with you, let me have my baby and then kill me"" and ""can you remove the baby from the womb"" when she realised there was no hope...This is a trashy account of the story and it SUCCEEDS in showing us that the kilings were not some sort of great ritualistic thing as been presented over the years.... But this was a total senseless massacre and THAT`s why this film succeeds; it speaks volumes why not the killers should ever be released."
4,intelligently written and directed,"Way better than the 1976 tv version, in fact, superior in every way--with the exception of Railsback's takeon Manson. Pretty damn gruesome, by the way. The actress who portrays Linda Kasabian is very good here.Writer/director John Gray does fine work. Am glad they showed what they showed of the courtroom scenes--because not only were they dull and went on too long in the '76 flick, but we already know what the verdict was and what happened."
5,Outstanding,"In this remake about the tragety that took place August 8.9 1969 the Manson killings was an incredable movie so much better more vived and more interesting then the 1976, television remake of this masacure."
3,5 stars for Davies. 3 stars for the movie.,"What more can I say than that jeremy davies is a true character acting genius and in my opinion saved Helter Skelter from being an absolute bomb. I caught myself on almost every scene that jeremy wasn't in anticapting his presence with the exception of the Tate scene. That was intense and you truley felt their pain and helplessness. Especially at the end of the slaughter when Tex Watson was finishing off Abigail folger and she says to him ""you finish it. I'm already dead"". It pulled my heart straight into my throat.This is a movie certainly worth checking out for the above reasons. It just fell a little flat for my taste. And I purposley didn't mention any of the other actors for the reason that they were very forgetable through most of the film."
1,Same as everything else,I have cn this movie and it sucked! Jeremy Davies trying to be a killer? Horrible! And in the scene where he kills Sharon Tate u can easily see the blood was Raspberry jam!!!!DONT BUY IT
3,ok but liked the 76 version better,The 1976 version felt more authentic because it was filmed not long after the actual hearings etc. It just had that 70's look and feel which made it more intersting. I also found the Charles Manson character in this movie a bit goofey at times. This movie is worth watching as it focuses more on the crimes and compliments the original.
1,I used to buy Chilton manuals for all my vehicles.,"For a reason I long ago forgot I have been buying Haynes manuals for years. I am trying to diagnose a problem in my ignition system sensors and relays. This book has little to no useful infomation on how to test the ignition coil, crankcase position sensor, camshaft position sensor, automatic shutdown relay, so on and so on except to tell you to take the vehicle to a shop. In fact some of the sensors and relays like the automatic shutdown relay aren't even mentioned in the manual at all that I can find.I now remember why I stopped purchasing Chilton manuals. They are absolutely useless and ""you bet ya"" I won't make this mistake again!"
1,Not Much Help,I have a 1996 Dodge Ram Cummins 3/4 ton four wheel drive. I purchase this manual to help me do maintenance on the vehicle. The manual does not show my front or rear differental or brakes and believe me if you have a Dodge 4/4 you are going to need a manual that does.
4,Ready For Revolution,"Proudly serving the lyrical needs of the Chicano community are the members of Aztlan Unerground. Their lyrics are inspired by the ""Xicano"" experience, and they deliver well in their songs. The music on this CD is a great accomplishment by a great Rock Band of the Chicano era. The implementation of indigenous instruments surprisingly compliments the music on this album. This CD is a must for any Chicano music collection!"
2,this game is not as simple as it looks,this game is just alittle hard the game play is to short for me it is a waste of money to pay for this game there are only six levels graphics arent that great average price for this game is $ 30.00 dont waste your money on just 6 levels this game is not worth that amount
2,Do not waste your money on this semi fun easy game,This game was a semi fun game and has 3 levels of difficulty. I found it very easy to beat in all 3 levels. You can be mickey or minnie and they have 4 different costumes. The boss Pete is really easy. All you have to do is shoot him. I say do not waste your money. You can beat it very quickly. I reccomend it for people who don't like very challenging games. There are not a lot of levels and once you beat a level you can't play it again. Do not buy if you like hard games.
2,Way to Short of a Blu-Ray !!!,"I really purchased this Blu-Ray hoping it would be an OK one.But as others have Commented is is way to Short.And also I agree with others that I bought it mainly to hear and see BB King, Not-His-Guest !!!If you purchase this Blu-Ray thinking you are going to hear BB King you are going to be Very Disappointed.He is really only doing a very few full length songs without interruption.I'm not saying the Guest were not good.I'm saying I wanted to hear BB King not his Guest.Beware people you have been, {Warned}........TerryBTW,I don't usually give Negative reviews hardly ever."
4,Good but not great show,"BB King is always great, but there are good shows and great shows. I reccomend this blu-ray just to the fans. If you looking to the definitive bb king's skip this and buy Live at The Regal."
1,jaggy,"didn't even open. returned for refund. the front shows BBK, but the back has a bunch of guests and tells how they all participate. I want to see BBK himself. Anybody tell me what BBK DVD to buy?"
5,book,The book was in very good condition and was received quickly. I was very happy with the transaction.
5,Legendary golden performances!,"At last! after a long waiting, the Sonny label has released this treasured album. The First piano Concerto is elegant and thundering with a persuasive and mercurial approach. One of my Five superior choices of this well known piece.The Second Piano Concerto simply is insuperable. I do not know about another performance that can steal its primacy. It possesses Oriental Fantasy, Caucasian passion, and febrile Balkan intensity. Graffman was truly enraptured and inspired as Ormandy did. This team made the most incandescent and Imperial performances of these two Piano Concertos Two and Three played with minor frequency than the First one.Finally these Pictures are authentically sparkling and superbly performed. In what Islamey concerns, two serious rivals: Simon Barere and Julius Katchen marked an abysmal distance respect the other players, and this version might be the Third choice.Voilá for this release."
4,Part of a collection,"This DVD is two episodes of what I hear is a ten episode collection. There is Darkest Knight, Darkest Knight 2, Darkest Knight III, and Fantasy Quest. Each with two episodes each. And I guess from what other reviewers said under the Fantasy Quest review area a fifth disk bring it to ten episodes; I have no idea of what that disk is called or I would own it too. The acting is ok, not great, the sets are poor, the stories are ok, they are all studio B. I watch them now and then. Most Fantasy Questing type movies are low budget; there are a few like The Lord of the Rings that are not, but most are studio B. And if you like these type of movies, as I do, then you watch a lot of low quality movies; and this is two episodes of one such DVD set."
4,Dragons?,"These are must have cheesy movies. We call them the movies with no dragons. You can find dragons on each of the three DVD covers, but there are no dragons in any of the six stories. Make it a night of laughing at and poking fun at these low budget fantasy movies. At least the story line moves along."
4,Good Camera Case,"I have bought this case for my Nikon FE2. It fits like a glove. It is very well made and clever design, but only for smaller lenses. It has two shortcoming. You will not be able to fit it with a telephoto lens. And you will need to remove it completely to use a tripod."
5,"Exceptionally rewarding experience, recommended","This was a Christmas present for myself, after hearing excerpts on various NPR stations.Although I've been enjoying the Glenn Gould recordings for decades, along with Wanda Landowsky's harpsichord recordings, I find myself frequently replaying this version.There's new life in the performance, previously-overlooked details emerge, and the sound quality is thrilling on good equipment. This is a safe bet for anyone looking for new pleasures and perspectives from familiar music."
5,Schiff,"The only thing better than this recording of Andras Schiff is seeing it in person. I'm glad I was able to get this and be able to listen to it over and over. I have the same work by Barenboim, Richter and Gould and this holds up well against them. I'd have a hard time picking any as my favorite."
5,Schiff rocks!,"Schiff is a real master, and his performances, whether live or recorded, are always a delight. Here are eighteen more words: more words, more words, more words, more words, more words. How's that for creativity?"
5,High Five&You feel the spirit,Sounds of Blackness always have moved Me as Artists&this Best of Gospel Collection Highlights there Soulful Blend of Music Combined with a Modern Sound that transcends there work for any time period.a Must have Set.
5,Music that astounds the inner ear!,The first time I heard this CD my brother informed me it was an upgrade to Gospel music. I was awed and especially to the fact that my younger brother knew of such things. Gods sets our paths to righteousness it's up to us to walk it. What better way to walk than with the Sounds of Blackness.
5,Soulful and Beautiful,"This CD is wonderful. If you are a ""Sounds of Blackness"" fan, you should purchase this for your collection. If you are not familiar with the ""Sounds"", this CD is a great introduction. The ""Sounds of Blackness"" released a new CD in September 2011. I have purchased this CD as well. The ""Sounds"" music delivers a message of hope. I highly recomend this CD and their newest release."
4,Sounds still sound good,"This is an excellent cd. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and the best producers, some of the best on the planet bar none! Anny Nesby is doing her thing and the choir, I'll call them are incredible! A great purchase, and also I feel a good one for someone going thru something.....The bonus... my favorite contemporary holiday song rounds out this album ""Soul Holiday"". Two words, buy it!"
5,Sounds of a People,"I am very familiar with the ""Sounds of Blackness"". The ""Sounds"" are unique in that they cannot be pigeonholed into a particular musical genre (gospel vs. secular). I was a member of this group a number of years ago and still feel a kinship. Gary Hines, the director has been associated with the ""Sounds"" since its inception at Macalester College. The focus of the ""Sounds"" was and has always been uplifting music from the Black experience, be it ""Steal Away"" to ""Satin Doll"" to ""Optimistic"". In a nutshell, the ""Sounds"" are about the best music from the Black experience. For want of a better word, it is a history lesson portrayed musically! If you're in love with the ""Sounds"", this is a must have for your collection. This music is certainly anointed by God. In times like these, we can all use a message of hope!"
1,A real disappointment for Lovecraft fans,"I seem to be in a similar position as the other reviewers-- I am a fan of Lovecraft, and I was disappointed to find that this was more of a rendition of Saw than any story by Lovecraft. Coincidentally, the night before viewing The Tomb, I watched another movie by the same director, Ulli Lommel, called ""Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven"" which also had nothing to do with the poem of the same name. I wish I had looked at the director before renting this movie! Both movies are B (or C?) movie quality, have incoherent plots, slow pacing, and leave fans of these turn-of-the-century horror writers feeling used and disappointed."
1,That Lovefeast guy,"I normally give a movie 2 stars automatically for tasteless nudity, but in the case of this film I'll make an exception. Anyone who has been stuck in a video game knows the frustration of watching this movie. With no sense of moving forward at all, the main characters walk around in circles watching people die. The acting could have been better (there were some good points there, notably the dude at the end). The sound is unforgivably bad - I actually missed dialog because I couldn't hear the actor. The budget for this movie should have at least been big enough to include a microphone and HD camera. Redubs could have been put in using free software tools available to anyone. The plot has nothing to do with H.P. Lovecraft, fear or anything of interest. I have been very impressed with some indie, low budget films in the past, which makes this one even more of a failure in my eyes.I hope the crew had fun making the movie, because no one will enjoy watching it."
1,couldn't even finish watching it,"I got this at a local video store fire sale for $8 or so... saw ""H.P. Lovecraft"" on it and thought it would be interesting. Boy, what a stinker! I could only tolerate about 30 minutes of this film before giving up. It was so boring and just wouldn't go anywhere. The little bit of dialog was meaningless, the set and doll head props were ridiculous, and the antagonist's repetitive taunting was so stupid. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Oh! My! Gawd!!!...,"Yep, I went ahead and watched THE TOMB, knowing full well that it might not be all that great. H.P. LOVECRAFT's name is in the title, and is mentioned a few times in the movie for no apparent reason. Other than that, he has nothing to do w/ this back-alley abortion. Two bad actors wake up in a warehouse, talk aimlessly, and wander around for 90 minutes. THE END. Meanwhile, the viewers brain shrinks and bleeds. Please, avoid this ""film"" as you would a rabid raccoon! Learn from my hideous mistake..."
1,Ulli Lommel!!!! ARGH!!!!,"Not until the movie started did I realize this was by Ulli Lommel. In my opinion, Ulli Lommel has made the WORST movies I've been subjected to. This one is no different. Save yourself from this movie!"
1,Suckorama filmed in suckaround vision,"Wow! Who is letting these people ruin HPL movies?!?! Oh did this film suck. That was the suckiest suctacular sucking of sucky sucks. How long was the movie? I don't know. All I know is my life is that much shorter now and I'll never get that time back.And how the hell did it have ANYTHING to do with Lovecraft?!?!?It was nothing more than an ultra low budget SAW ripoff. My daughter makes better movies with her Hannah Montana camcorder.All I got to say is, ""plah hleck, bleah, ptui! The old omes hate you!!!"""
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie is beyond bad...it's borring and low budget sillyness...please don't even wasye your time.what makes it so bad I saw it for free on fear net.com.......
4,more detail,The dialogues and vocabulary are more detailed than the study book I have. I am using this book to augment my study. I think it's working!
4,THE single book to read about the CS Navy,"The book is the best, single book written about the CS navy that I've ever come across. It's written in an entertaining way that even non-history buffs will find themselves being engrossed in the titanic struggles waged by the tiny southern navy against the Union juggernaut. Mr. Luraghi shows that he did his homework in dredging up the most obscure and interesting facts including the contributions of Blacks in Confederate service (example: Moses Austin, a free black who died in the attack on the U.S.S. Water Witch). The only downside to the book is the sections that go into overwhelming detail on the ships of Dixie. Other than that, it is an excellent book and it is essential reading for anyone wishing to know about the Confederate Navy."
2,Way too baggy,"I bought a couple pairs of these online in size 36x34. I knew they would be a little baggy from a couple reviews, but I must have gotten a different pair than the other reviewers. I could fit two of my legs into each legging, and it felt like I was wearing pajamas or something. Other than that I liked them; waist, fabric, and the extra pockets were nice, just they were too sloppy looking to me. Back to my search for a pair of microfiber golf pants that are reasonably priced for now."
1,"Too Basic, No Info","If you have even the most basic herp knowledge, this book will disappoint you. This book does not do justice to the rough green snake and reads like a report submitted by a second grader. Don't waste your money!"
2,Nothing New Under The Sun,"First of all this book is a great failure, from the point of view of who the author is. It is a shame that Crone was forced by Columbia University Press to write this kind of general survey. The book only repeats what has been know for more than 50 or 60 years. Scholars such as Laoust have already given us a much better account of these issues. In fact, one feels that this is almost a translation of Laoust's book. Importantly, there is no political theorizing in this work, only description.This is really nothing but a basic and not so practical textbook that pretends to be scholarship. I hope Crone will use in a more scholarly way her position at the School of Advanced Studies. This is not the kind of book one expects from her."
2,Not original jacket,"This is not the original Driclime. They have made some modifications - mostly thicker material and a different fit. If you loved the first one you bought (which I didn't know anyone who didn't), then don't get this one - you will be disappointed."
2,What were they thinking?,"I loved La Kahena, and would give it 7 or 8 stars if I could, but I can't. This disc is a piece of crap. First, it sounds like it was mixed by a hearing impaired person. Second, the need to remix the brilliance of La Kahena to make it palatable to what someone thinks is American club culture (at least as it may be thought to exist in a place like Houston, Kansas City, or Pierre, South Dakota) just escapes me. La Kahena is a brave and brilliant integration of rockin' Maghrebi sounds. This ... ick!Two stars for the original."
5,i loved it.,this book is great.it has every thing you need to know about xena.it has a chapter on the broodway production of grease that lucy was in.what lucy and renee were like as kids.it also has two or three pages of comics.if you love xena you'll live this book.
3,Moja or Acid,"As one previous reviewer put it - this CD was classic Azymuth music but nothing earth shattering; I've been waiting for them to put out another track similar to the dynamic classic - ""Last Night in Rio"" which is truly a stepper's delight!"
1,I'm perplexed,"I bought this on the strength of the glowing reviews here, and I can't figure it out.This is an awful recording. Ms. Peyroux has no musicality whatsoever, is often off key, has no sense of phrasing...The band is competent, not great, but vastly superior to Ms. Peyroux. But I don't buy a vocalist's recording to listen to the band.I cannot fathom how this artist has received the reviews she has. Her voice may be an attempt at a carbon copy of Holiday, but she has none of the depth, and none of the empathy for the material, of the original.Save your money. This one joins Jane Monheit and Stacy Kent in the ""huge disappointment"" category."
2,One good song,"Her cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Dance Me To The End Of Love"" rivals the original. But the rest of the album is pretty bland. She has a very good voice that's almost just like Billie Holliday but not quite. Her backing band is very good but just not good enough. Although many people hate her, Norah Jones had found her own voice and that's why her first album was so great. Madeleine Peyroux has yet to find her own voice, both literally and figuratively speaking. If she does, she'll become a much more accomplished artist. But until then, save yourself the money and just download the Cohen cover."
3,"David Sedaris, is that you?","If you have ever heard David Sedaris channel Billie Holiday, do not buy this album. All I can think of when I listen to it is him singing ""My bologna has a first name ...."" in his Billie Holiday voice ... you can't help but laugh. There's no room left to appreciate Madeleine, unfortunately."
2,will she ever be herself?,"There is not doubt that this CD will be a commercial success. She sounds so nice. However, she is simply Billie Holiday. You are not listening to anything new. She will be nice to listen to live but will she ever become herself in time? If Peyroux happens to get out of Billie Holidays influence, then will anybody listen to her? Very nice but sad at the same time."
4,Like Syrup on Waffles,"Madeleine's voice pours over you with a sweetness that is undeniable. As a relative ""newbie"" to this type of music, I was very pleased with how easy it was to lose myself in her songs. The laid-back beat and sultry basslines will hold on to you, drawing you in to a relaxed mood. Definitely worth a listen!"
3,I have to agree with the Sedaris comment,"I find this album occasionally enjoyable, particularly the Leonard Cohen song. Unfortunately, her singing voice is very similar to David Sedaris' Billie Holiday impersonation. In fact, the similarity to Holiday is very distracting and keeps the album from being very memorable.While I'm on it, I don't get this thing with trying to sound like Billie Holiday. Billie Holiday did a really fine job of it, but the rest (Peyroux, Norah Jones) apparently are unable to come up with their own vocal identity."
5,A Superb Singer on her Best CD,"I first heard Peyroux' ""Don't Wait Too Long"" on NPR and immediately bought the Careless Love CD. What a treasure! At first she did remind me of Holiday, but the more I listened, the more I heard her own sound and style. This is one I can play over and over and never tire of (especially Between the Bars - incredible!). I have probably given this CD to a dozen friends, who in turn have become big fans. While I have also enjoyed her other CDs, this one remains my favorite and, I think, her best."
5,This is heaven to me...,"Contemplative, moody, pensive, deep - Madeleine Peyroux! Range, timbre, in love with love, earthy - Plugged into something greater than herself. This album sends me! The vocals, the musicianship, the sound craft and engineering: ""Careless Love"" is a must have for anyone who appreciates music. Every cut is a well-crafted gem, the best forty-minutes you'll ever spend on a lazy summer (or rainy) day. ""Dance me""..., ""You're gonna make me lonesome when you go"", ""J'a deux amours"", ""Weary Blues"", ""This is heaven to me"", absolute gems! Madeleine Peyroux is a national treasure. Reminiscent of Billie Holiday upon first impression, her vocal styling really is unique and speaks to her no doubt many influences and experiences in their own right. Can't wait to pick up the rest of her songbook. Recommend it, I would!!!"
4,"lovely music, unexpected voice","I'd never heard Madeleine Peyroux before, but had heard of her through friends. She has a wide, open voice, reminiscent of K. D. Lang. Nothing was expected, I was delighted with the sound. Her voice is intelligent and sensual."
3,Great Voice But...,"Occasionally, I buy music based on the strength of one standout song I've heard. That was the case with Careless Love. Peyroux's rendition of Leonard Cohen's Dance Me To The End of Love was so enchanting, I just had to hear more. So, I ordered this CD from an amazon partner and felt a frisson of great anticipation the day it arrived.Well, I am kind of disappointed. Peyroux does have great voice, but overall the CD is far too loungy and retro for me. It would be great as the musical backdrop to a romantic evening, but its never going to be in heavy rotation. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the quality of the music, its just not my style. If I had to pick favorites here in addition to the song for which I bought this, I would have to pick Lonesome Road and the title cut.So if you like sultry, smoky lounge music of the kind you may have heard in the style's heyday, then Careless Love may be for you. But if you anticipate something with more edge, then skip this."
4,Bessie Smith Redux,Take a trip back in time with this young white singer who does the blues with the uncanny feel and lilt of black Bessie Smith.
3,"Nice, but not dazzling","I enjoyed this album. The title cut is the one real winner here. As a devout Billie Holiday fan, I appreciated the fact that despite Ms. Peyroux's voice being very similar she doesn't really try to imitate.Would recommend to those looking for something soothing and relaxing."
3,"Nice enough, but...","Madeleine Peyroux has a great voice and terrific taste in songs to cover, and the band backing her up here hits all the right mellow, jazzy notes. If she keeps up the effort, she's bound to produce some classic recordings. But she isn't quite there yet. There's nothing really wrong with these twelve songs - certainly nothing jumps out as poorly done. The problem is more that nothing really jumps out, period. Hearing their songs so tastefully copied makes me want to listen to Bessie Smith, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Hank Williams, but Peyroux doesn't make much of a case as to why we should listen to her versions instead of the originals. Not bad at all, but only not bad."
4,"Madeleine Peyroux, WHO??????","Well, who is she????? Well, during the listen, I guessed Billie Holliday but then Doris Day kept piping in. i could not tell which singer it was, and low and behold it was a combo of the two in the persona of Mis Madeleine. Dont buy this for any thing but easy listening. It is the perfect background dinner music or for a middle age seduction, If you put it in the car for listening on a drive you will fall asleep, Her perfect Ella Fitzgerald voice is slow and easy. It is a wonderful listen, great for a rainy lazy afternoon in the hammock."
2,Billie Holliday on Bourbon Street,"Like the title reads ... if you think you will enjoy a dose of Billy Holliday infused with the New Orleans sound, then you might enjoy this CD. I did not."
1,Better the original.,"I bought this cd a few days ago. When I put it on the cd-player and let it flow on, it immediately stunned me.As a singer, I thought, I would pass my life getting over identity crisis if I had my voice even barely similar to Elvis' one, or Elton John's one, or Freddy Mercury's one.Well, that's it: Madeleine Peyroux sings exactly (E-x-a-c-t-l-y) as Billie Holiday. My God, this is not a good thing.I mean, this is probably the only reason for the release of this cd: Billie Holiday is old enough to be forgotten and renewed, and this young lady could be the new Lady Day.But, in my opinion, it's so much better to prefer the original version to the... remix. And Madeleine Peyroux it's just an insignificant copy of the late, great jazz woman: Billie Holiday.There are so many Billie's cd out there, buy some of them and enjoy... more and better."
1,anesthetized on a table,"It took her 8 years to come up with this? This is a great collection of songs, but she manages to wring all the life out of them with her shallow, expressionless vocal stylings. It's a good thing she's not a doctor.The arrangment on Between The Bars is fantastic - I would pay good money to hear just about any other singer cover it.This album is coma inducing. If Dionne Warwick and Karen Carpenter were cloned into one female jazz singer, this would be it."
4,Room For Both,"I was introduced to Madeleine Peyroux shortly after the release of 'Dreamland' by hearing her perform live. I was an immediate fan. Yes, I immediately had thoughts of a reincarnated Billie Holiday...but not a clone. I was not disappointed after hearing this release as I believe Madeleine has continued to mature into an artist of note. Do you think it's possible that Madeleine is not trying to imitate anyone? If her style and delivery are reminiscent of Billie Holiday, why not celebrate and enjoy her fresh presentations for the same reason you are drawn to Billie's? To discredit Miss Peyroux is to pay a disservice to both she and the style of delivery you love in Bille.This cd is a great chill collection and a perfect companion to Dreamland."
4,No Imitation Here!,"While tempted to write a song by song analysis of this CD, I will show restraint and simply comment on the Holiday imitation complaints. As a collector of vintage Holiday, I actually had to listen for the similarities before I made the connection at all. Some of the phrasing is perhaps similar, (think any male singer in the late 40s and Sinatra) but Peyroux sings with her own voice, hits the standards with a new and often superior interpretation, with a band that is quite competent. A bit of repetition on the cymbals left me with a sense of one sound fits all, but Peyroux herself is a delight. If you love Holiday this CD won't give a Rich-Little-like shiver. With the rest of the music industry still trying to sound like Aretha Franklin, this is a relief. Peyroux has a bright future, send us more like her!"
2,Emotionless Billie Holiday Wannabe,"While Ms. Peyroux's voice bears an undeniable resemblance to that of Billie Holiday, her singing is another matter entirely. Whereas Holiday, like all great artists, could express a wide variety of emotions, Peyroux seems unable to express any. Is Peyroux one of those zombies you hear about?I've yet to hear Dreamland, but after hearing this album, I won't be in any hurry."
2,somewhat disappointed,"We really enjoy a lot of contemporary, and old, French music and musicians, and although I prefer to advance an artist, in this matter I must say that listening to the ""samples"" was inadequate as to the contents of the cd. The mistake is mine for buying the cd....other than the Leonard Cohen lyrics, the rest of the songs to me was mush."
3,not her best work,I'm a big fan and I guess my expectations are high. Or maybe I should have bought her early work (this) first. Later work is wonderful. This is merely lovely.
3,Way overhyped,"Great elevator music - unless you listen closely you may just think that the CD is one long song. Madeleine has an uncanny knack of making substantially disparate songs sound the same. What was her producer thinking? I can't imagine. Like I said this is good backround music if you are in a mellow mood. The anology to Billy Holliday is ridiculous. Madeleine's voice is pleasant and the compositions do not offend, but unless musical homgeny is something you seek out do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere."
2,NO New sounds on this CD,"This CD has nothing new on it. I am just tired of the same songs being sung over and over. She has a great voice, just no inspiration."
5,A Must Have,"When I stumble on an artist that is new to me but really catches my attention, I usually want to hear more of their work or do some research on them before I open the wallet. However, when I walked into a music store yesterday and heard this incredible version of Dance Me to the End of Love being played, I immediately asked who the singer isI was not familiar with Natalie Peyroux, other than by name. But I said this is all I need to hear. This is a ""must have"" disk. Listening to the rest of it hasn't dampened the enthusiasm.Hopefully, Ms. Peroux will build on this effort and not keeping us waiting very long for a follow-up. I, and many others, will certainly be waiting."
2,needing a little more,"While I agree with the rest of the reviewers that this artist has a gifted singing voice, the lyrics of her song leaves much to be desired. Her articulations are not very clear or convincing, especially in the French songs. All these said, if you are looking for something truly satisfying, opt for an orginal Holiday instead of this imitation."
2,nothing new,"Though wonderful music is chosen for Peyroux's covers, her voice is not as unique as Starbucks would like you to believe. She sounds like Billie Holliday with a cold, and her cover of ""Between the Bars"" personally offends me as a diehard Elliott Smith fan. The orignal had a beauty to balance the pain. Her version is just dark and dull."
2,Good songs - low quality audio (MP3),The music is great. A nice re-styled 1930's blues-jazz music. It has a sultry relaxed feel that is absent in current music. It almost feels like the antidote for today's sound. The bad: Most of the MP3 songs I bought are distorted. None of my other Amazon downloads are like this. I doubt the CD has the same problem or people would not rate it so highly. It annoys me that I thought my player had a problem and found and had to spend hours troubleshooting. Same problem on different players.
3,Too Much Billie Holliday,"I have never heard somebody capture the Billie Holliday sound as well as this woman. Unfortunately, once the novelty of that feat wears off, I was left wondering why I simply didn't play a Billie Holliday CD. I still give this CD three stars, because ""Dance Me to the Edge of Love"" is a great cut, and her voice, as well as the songs themselves, are very pleasant to listen to. I hope this woman will find a more original way to convey the music that is clearly in her soul."
3,CANADIAN ROCK!!!,Catchy rock from Canada that has a stoner/70's sound.Great driving music or just to hang out.Produced by 70's producer Nick Blagona.If you like this type of music check this out.
1,PREJUDICE,"As a huge fan of brian lumley, I was extremely disturbed by this book. After only a few chapters, I put it down. The racial prejudice shown in this writing was intolerable. If this is Mr. Lumley's true nature, this will be the last book of his that I spent money on.example: ""blacks they were, curly headed, black caravan, white gold(slaves)Don't think I am thin-skinned. I happen to be an anglo, but take it for what it is worth."
5,Authentic transmission,"This book contains an authentic transmission of seated '8 pieces of brocade' qigong with complete instructions for opening the microcosmic orbit.It contains a very good translation of Chinese texts and useful commentary by the author.Please note that no book can replace a teacher, but it can serve as a good supplementary material.Very recommended!!!"
5,Putco 403608 Chrome Trim Side Marker Lamp Cover,I have enjoyed the product and arived in a timely matter.Looks great on my HummerNice people to deal with.
4,Tough as nails,"I have the 990 version of this and took it on location in Europe for 3 months in the dead of winter. I froze it, dropped it, banged it around, subjected it to some really lousy weather and it just kept on ticking. I don't care for the menu reading that has to be done when you are trying to do something a little different, but it's reliable as, well as reliable as a Nikon is supposed to be. The image clarity was better than I expected and we actually used some of the stills to cobble together a quick shot that the principal crew didn't get. It's now in the movie..."
3,Not my favorite tool,"I use this camera at work, often on occasions when I am sent on assignments I didn't know about when I went home the evening prior.This is not my favorite camera for a number of reasons. What bothers me most is the view I receive through the viewfinder. The viewfinder is small, to begin, being only about one square inch. The views are often clouded in shades of red, gray or black, also, not what you look at with the naked eye.Turning the camera in half, like the photo on this page, does not improve matters. I find this camera somewhat difficult to manage with controls being tiny and that abominable viewfinder constantly creating problems for me.It does take fine pictures, however, and transferring them from the camera to a PC or other media is simply a matter of plugging in and pushing a button. So it does the job well. If only it was an equal pleasure while I was using it I could rate this better."
1,Burned out pixels.,"I upgraded from the 990 to the 995. I use this camera commercially. The reason for the upgrade was that the 990 had burned out pixels which had to be painted over with Paint Shop Pro on each photo used. Impossible to contact Nikon, so I put up with it. The 995 also has burned out pixels and has problems in loading to a PC. The great Nikon camera company goes down the toilet in my book. I'll go back to using my 35mm Photomic, or buy a Sony Digital."
1,Flash not sychronized??,"I bought a Nikon Coolpix 995 about two weeks ago after reading all the rave reviews and, of course, trusting the Nikon name. But it has been quite a disappointing experience to me because of the electronic flash problem. 8 out of 10 flash pictures come very dark with ""red-eye"". I talked to customer support at Nikon twice and I yet have to find somebody who knows about (any) cameras yet!! Has anybody else experienced a similar problem? ...Thanks"
4,Interesting and balanced,"Jon Guttman presents an authoritative and clearly well researched account of pioneering fighter aircraft exploits. Many of the stories told are not previously well known and make the point that the history of fighting aircraft was shaped by more than just the cliche Fokkers, Me 109s and Spitfires. He appraises the feats of the BE2s, Fiats and Meteors and their remarkable pilots in an readable and entertaining style without resorting to sensationalism. Wholeheartedly recommended to the avergae reader of military history as well as the aviation enthusiast."
5,Very pleased,"Book has alot of information , both pro and con , on aircraft in WWII , couldnt put down the book , a good look at behind the scenes of aircraft developement ."
5,Great Music DVD! Good Audio Quality.,"I have bought a few music DVD's over the last few years and this is one of the best I now have. It has a great selection of the artist's songs and the sound quality is very good! Many live music performances are not too good regarding audio quality, but not this one- very, very good!BobSonthern California, CA USA"
5,I want more Lucinda on DVD !!,"Luncinda on Austin City is a real prize - I really enjoyed this DVD - I just wish there was more !!! As with other Ausin City DVD's Ive seen, there is no 'extras' or 'bonus footage'. But the 74 minutes of Lucinda & her band here is a prime time, top notch performance. I would like to see MORE Lucinda DVD stuff released (like perhaps the Fillmore concert?) - but for now, this is it."
5,good sounds,"this album is one of there finest,I reccomend it to any one is truly a digital music freak and loves industrial."
4,A great read.,"Who would of thought a story about Flint and Gully Dwarves could be so moving? This book is very good and it captures the spirit of the first two trilogies. It has everything you can ask for in a fantasy novel, action, danger, comedy, romance (who would of thought that Flint could be romantic) and a great villian. this was by far my favorite in the Preludes series so far. It shows you another side of Flint other than the grumpy old dwarf, and it gives you a better understanding of why he was the way he was in the first trilogy. My hat goes off to Mary Kirchoff & Douglas Niles they did a fine job."
5,I am majere9 I've read 40 dl books and I know a good book!,This book was great I thought Flint was a dull character until reading this book it really brought him out! Whoever reads this will like It I am quite sure! Thanks Mary Kirchoff and Douglas Niles!
5,"THIS BOOK WAS LIKE SO GREAT ,LIKE AWESOME",I am so glad they published this book or like i would never have converted to a Christian.
3,A fun book!,"While I don't think as highly of this book as most do, it's still a good book, giving you a glimpse into the lives of Flint's people. I just felt it was a little longer than it needed to be.I have read approx. 60 Dragonlance books & so far there's only 4 - The Oath & The Measure,The Companions,Darkness & Light and Kendermore - that I would have to warn against buying."
3,Flint the King,"Word of warning - Flint was never one of my favorite characters. However, this book really changed my mind about him. A different side of Flint was shown as he romps about the underground dwarven kingdoms with an evil dwarf turned good and band of gully dwarves (the not so bright side of the dwarven family tree). It was great to see a more humorous and gentle side to the always stoic character."
5,This is the one for PL/I,Robin Vowel's book compliments Hughe's book for a variety of algorithms and none-MVS platforms (emphasizing certain PL/I facilities well).NB.Caution with inexpensive used copies. They may not be the latest edtion. Previous editions are more verbose.

1,DUSTY VINYL WITH SCRATCHES,"The LP arrived dirty and scratched. It is too difficult to return (though that was offered by amazon); to much trouble to find packaging, etc."
3,A bit out dated,"A lot of good information but the author seems to be behind in the modern day cartridges. Russ Haydon of the Woodchuck Den has really brought the 20 cal. into public view. With the several 20 cals. out there the author mentioned the 204 Ruger (an outstanding round), but very little else in that caliber."
5,A much needed update now delivered.,"This updated manual contains much needed recent developments, especially new cartridges for Smith and Wesson firearms."
4,Cartridges of the World 11th Edition,"Cartridges of World 11th Edition follows on previous editions of the same, they have updated the rounds that have came into existance since those editions were published, I was interested in what they had to say about the new WSM's and the Remington Ultra rounds. I was happy with the book when I reviewed it as I have been with the past issues I have been able to go through."
4,"Good, but>","Cartridges of the world is a must have for any serious shooter, reloader and gun enthusiast. The current book has more and newer cartridges than the older edition but I do not think it as quite informative in general as when Frank Barnes was the editor."
5,Great book but not for everyone,"This book is an encyclopedia of cartridges. It gives a bit of history and background for just about every cartridge ever made and where possible it also gives velocity and energy figures for several factory and handloaded loadings for the cartridge. There is also a bit of history of ammo, markings, and more.If you are at a point where you don't know the difference between a cartridge and a bullet you may find more info than you can handle. If you are ready to start really learning about common, rare and obsolete handgun, rifle and shotgun cartridges this is the book for you. If, like me, you are an information junkie and you are into guns, this book is indespensible."
4,A Very Good Reference Book,"This book is a useful addition to any firearms enthusiast's library. It covers a wide range of pistol, rifle and shotgun cartridges, both modern and obsolete. The only thing that would make this book better is dimensioned illustrations of all the cartridges listed."
2,"Used books, do not expect too much.","First time I purchased a used book. Maybe I expected too much.Book was well used, and had coffee stains, etc. I would never had given this book"" evem free.Maybe I expected too much.Robert J Johnson"
2,Disappointing,"This book did not live up to expectations. The discussions of the rounds did not tell the reader enough useful information. There were a lot of fun to know facts - amaze your friends and all of that - but not enough information on how to use the round, good ranges to sight in the various rounds versus potential uses, reloading insights (best loads, best rifle twists for what bullet weight) and more of that kind of technical information. That is why I only gave the book two stars."
5,The Book for those who want to know more about ammo,"If you are puzzled by the varied and complex world of cartridges, then go no further than this great book. It is well organized, has excellent photos and illustrations and is well worth the price. That and it covers just about every round from the puny shooting gallery rounds to the monster British Safari rounds."
4,good reference,This book is very good reference material. I use this book almost daily to get case dimensions for obsolete calibers. Well worth the money.
3,Could be improved.,A good book that could be improved by putting many more pictures with dimensions and case powder area's - some dimensions do exist but not enough.
3,Could have been better...,"When reading through this book, I found much of the information to be quite helpful. But one fact that bothered me while reading is that the units used to denote different measurements are not marked. At first I was thrown off by this, as I am used to the metric SI standard, rather than the Imperical Standard of measurements. Another fact that irked me, but wouldn't stop me from buying the book, was that certain cartridges are unlisted in this book, some very old and others radical and new. For the most part, the cartridges unlisted can be considered ""Military grade"" but they can still be acquired legally on the civilian market. An alright book that takes on the massive undertaking of gathering up information on the world's plentiful ammunition cartridges, I feel that this book overlooked some very important and common cartridges. I hope that in a later edition, said problems would be fixed. Beyond that, this book is a good reference for any gun hobbyists out there."
5,All I need,This book is the latest in the line of Cartridges books. I'm not sure I'd put the information together the way they do but all the information you need is there.
1,POOR CONDITION,Cartridges of the World is great but the copy that the company shipped me was in very poor condition. They said it was like new. I would not order form this company again.
3,Changing the indgredients,I really love this product and it works well for me except now they changed the ingredients. It actually says no sugar is added but the first ingredient listed is Maltodextrin. Last time I checked that was a sugar!! Grrr. I had reactions from taking their product. :(
3,Ehh,The product is the exact same as you would buy in a store but it seemed like it took a long time to get. So long that i ended up going to the store and purchasing it because i didnt want to wait any longer. If you arent near a vitamin shoppe and you want this product go for it.
1,Beware of extra daily charges not disclosed!,"I got one of these for my daughter-in-law when I got her a Verizon Wireless PN-215 Prepaid Phone. She couldn't understand why her credit decreased daily, even when she never made a call. There is a 99 cents per day charge whether you use the card or not. So basically . . .what did the $50 buy???I wish we could give a negative number of stars for the rating of this product."
3,Its a playstation one memory card !,The only way this memory card is worth $35 is if they no longer make it and its very hard to find and you just want to collect it for the memory of the Playstation system otherwise i would not pay more then about $10 for this but do not try and sell it to Gamespot they will give you $0.25 for it and i am not even remotely joking about this !
2,Good but deceptive,"The posting shows pictures of the original Sony Playstation memory card. By Sony. However, what I received was not an original but some other brand besides Sony. I wanted one of the originals because I am playing some old PS1 games on a PS2 and a lot of forums I've read state that the original official sony branded memory cards are the best for saving the game. Which is why I purchased this particular one. Instead, I get some random aftermarket card by some maker I've never heard of.The card does actually work, so I can't complain on that. But, I think that it needs to be made clear that what you are getting is not what is advertised."
5,Sony PS1 Memory for PS2,"I bought this item so I could use it for playing PlayStation 1 games on my PS2 Slim; I had heard that there are a ton of problems with aftermarket PS1 memory cards not working on PS2 models. The original is definitely the way to go. I have had no problems, and 1 MB is more than plenty of space for playing PS1 games, which take up very minimal memory space. 1 MB for PS1 games stores about as much as an 8 MB does for PS2. Sony is the only way to go, even if you buy used."
3,long delivery time,"Product came as described, but over two weeks late and only after I emailed gamediva support."
1,generic card from gamez network,"This product was no good from Gamez Network. It said ps1 card on it, but wasn't the official memory card pictured. I recieved it quickly; however, after saving once, the next time I went to load, the data was corrupted. It still doesnt work properly. So be careful who you buy it from."
3,its ok,well this product is good.the reason i bought it was because my husband and i both have ps1 games and no way of saving the game.its a good buy if you need a ps1
1,sony game card broken does not save at all,the sony game card i purchased will not save any game at all. it is defective and a waste of my money
1,"this is a memory card,not a game!",Since this is a review of a MEMORY CARD all I can write in a positve way is that it works.The only negitive is that it isn't gray or a authenic Sony card.
2,"Sony name, but not Sony quality","This product is not very good. I ordered from Gamez Network, and it did arrive very quickly. I was pleasantly surprised that the memory card has the Sony name on it, and not a knock-off brand. However, it takes on average more than ten tries just to save a game. So, it does save, and it loads fine, but you have to keep, keep, keep on trying just to save. Very annoying!"
4,Lost memory in format?,"I bought this to play PS1 games in my PS2. The previous memory card I tried did not work. (It was not Sony brand.) While this works, when it was formatted, it lost 80% of its stated capacity. There is still enough room for my purposes, because I have only a couple PS1 games, but it's worth noting that you don't get a full megabyte -- not even close. Of course, it could be that a got a bad one. I did get a used one."
5,Received the wrong one.,"I received a PS1 and not an original Playstation 1 memory card. I know it may sound stupid but I'm one of those who likes to match accessories to their consoles since I still have an original Playstation. I still gave it 5 stars however, only because the item itself works and also the seller refunded me the amount and didn't ask for it back...(??) But hey, it is what it is."
3,Just what I needed!,"It is just what I needed to play classic ps1 games on a ps2. It is the only way to go, you want to get a name brand memory card for older systems."
2,Not exactly what i expected,When i ordered this product i though i was going to get an original gray playstation memory card. What i got though was a memory card for the PSone. A new sleeker model that still works fine but isn't what the seller said it was going to be. I'll still keep it and use it though.
1,NOT the official Sony Memory Card,The momory card I received was NOT the one pictured. I received a generic knock off product. My PS1 did not even recognize it as a memory card. Beware! Amazon are you reading this? I hope so.
4,If bigger it would be better.,This is a nice memory card but it does not hold that much. Yes it is old and made for the psone but most people had allot of games so u cant put allot on this one. It is made by sony so it is the best brand to buy but it should have been much bigger. If i were u i would either buy two of them or get a bigger one.

3,The Third Consequence ..... how to fly the F-117 Stealth,"Chris Stewart has written a fine novel about Air force life and how the U.S. might handle military traitors selling secrets to foreign powers. He has done the research to make his book a reference for the military and political action going on in the middle east.The only problem with the book might be with the publisher, M. Evans and Co. Evans must not have an editor or they employ a one who isn't very good, There were many typos and grammatical errors.If you like the authors Cussler, Brown and Clancy, you won't go wrong with The Third Consequence."
3,Not up to par for Stewart.,A little disappointing! The plot was intriguing but with so many characters I kept getting a little confused. But as always I loved the flying and action sequences which of course Stewart does these so well. Looking forward to his next book!
1,got bad sample,"I think I got a bad sample, the photos were so fuzzy on my d5000 that my 30$ point-and-shoot could take better ones. But I was happy with the macro shots, which were not fuzzy at all. :["
3,Interesting designs but the title is misleading,"I found some very interesting nature patterns in this book, but almost a fifth of the book contained designs (at least 12) which I found unrecognizable as anything belonging to nature or anything else. If you are into these abstract designs, then this is an added bonus. I was disappointed and would rather have had traditional nature designs as pictured on the cover."
1,Good Designs but no color guides for clarity,The designs are very good. The problem I see with this book is there no finished designs or color guides. If you are new to stained glass it could be difficult to visualize a finished design. But all in all a good design book.
1,Save your money...,"I could reiterate what the others have said but I won't make you read it all over again. Trust me, keep looking."
2,Can't recommend,"It's amazing how some folks can stretch out a thirty word sentence when only ten words are called for. This book has major verbal bloat, and is unfortunately myopic in it's focus on Britain. The authors have the arrogance to label a myriad of leaders from history as lacking in intelligence, without the backbone or clarity to define it or state why. Although the book does cover the basic facts, one gets the impression the authors were more impressed with their own observations and verbosity."
1,Long winded and extremely boring.,"I normally love stories of the Second World War, which is what prompted me to buy and read this 1,360 page book. I thought I would never get through it. Though the authors did a good job on the atomic bomb section, the rest was pure drivel, a lot of speculation, unnecessary background information, and enough to put an owl to sleep at night. There are many great World War II books out there, but this is certainly not one of them. The inserted maps are pretty good, but other than that, the only thing good I can say about this book is that thank goodness I finished it. Not recommended at all."
2,An Unbalanced Account,"A fully satisfactory one-volume history of the Second World War may be an impossibility, but this tome doesn't come close. Its worst faults are its weird misallocations of space (pages and pages on British social developments and Japanese politics in the 1930's, for example, but only a single chapter on the Russian front) and its very summary treatment of most military developments. As a result it is not very useful as a reference. Although the political and diplomatic history of the war is emphasized, the analysis of this area is disjointed and undeveloped, bogged down by details that are never fitted into a framework. Lesser faults are sloppy writing and editing in many places and a preachy and moralistic ""PC"" tone that misses no opportunity to denigrate the Allies and especially the United States. The only recommendation, and this is only for buffs, is that you may well find some factual nuggets that you were previously unaware of."
2,A Bad Disappointment.,"I thought this history of WWII was disappointing. It has way too many minute details about unimportant British details. It is unbalanced about the most important battles and unbalanced in telling the story of WWII. The book is a bit pedantic. It feels self serving in the approach. Hypocritical, it mostly justifies the British bombing efforts in Europe that drove the war's mass bombings and was dubious in effectiveness, but then calls the devastating bombings of Japan ""mass murder.""There are better books than this on WWII."
4,An excellent additon to the collection of any fan or DJ,"While I generally tend to find remix collections rather tedious, I still feel the need to recommend this CD. It's a necessity, of course, for any Rosetta Stone completist, and club DJ's will likely find it nice to have an alternative to the album versions of ""Adrenaline"" and ""The Witch"". The various remixes of these two club hits are still easily recognizable as the songs from which they were culled, but bear just enough distinction in comparison to the originals to warrant spending the money.The shining star of this EP, however, is the cover of ""Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves"". This track is, again, very easily recognizable, but the band has brilliantly applied their own sound to it without detracting from it a bit - personally, I'd consider it just as dance-worthy as either of the other two songs featured here."
5,Bulova 96L89,"Apart from the great service I received from Amazon, the watch was equally stunning. I first saw this watch on-line. I thought it was beautiful. I purchased it for my Fiancée; she was blown away by it. The watch was a winner in every category. Simply worth far more than the price tag."
1,SAVE YOURSELF - DO NOT BUY THIS!,"My husband spent an entire weekend installing a security system with this 100 cable. Finally finished, turned everything on and IT DIDN'T WORK. He's an electrical enginneer so has the ability to quality test the unit, cameras and cable and determined the cable was bad. Poor quality control and a piece of junk! Spend a few extra bucks, buy something else from somewhere else. I suggested to my husband to not buy this based on the bad feedback from others who had the idential problem, but you always think you'll be the exception. You're not. My husband will spend a day taking everything down and redoing all of his work. Reinstalling everything! What a waste of time for a $20 product that clearly has poor (probably zero) quality control. With this many people all having the same problem how can they sell this. Save yourself, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! With this much negative feedback with the same problem Amazon should REMOVE THIS PRODUCT FROM THEIR INVENTORY."
2,Cheep Cheep Cheap?,"These are the only cables on Amazon that are 100' long and include power so I picked up a few (four). They arrived, white, and with all connectors but let me tell you something - they're not ""Tamper resistant"" by any means like it says on the box. They're cheap little headphone wire style sheathed cable attached to BNC connectors.DO NOT STRESS THEM AT ALL OR THEY WILL BREAK!!Having said that, if you just plan on laying them on your attic floor or dropping them down a pipe they're fine. They do what they're supposed to.Just don't try fishing them through a wall, pole piping, or a hole.Seems like their connectors are held on with bubble gum and imagination."
4,Security Camera wiring,The wiring is for necessary extensions to install our security cameras. It is exactly what I expected and appears to be of good quality. We have not finalized the installation yet.
1,DO NOT BUY! WARNING,WARNING DO NOT BUY ANY Q-SEE PRODUCTS.. HORRIBLE PRODUCTS AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.. GO WITH A DIFFERENT BRAND.. VERY VERY BAD SERVICE
2,Not Good Outdoors,"The cable gave me an OK picture, but after a couple years outdoors it would snap/break wherever I touched it, exposing the shielding inside. Pretty lame."
4,QS100B Video and Power cord,Great product for the money spent. We were limited to the quantity we could order. The product worked excellent for its intended use.
2,Great packaging & addon's but poor cable.,"Cable is packaged great and they give you adapters that make life easier, however these cables are not able to run some of my cameras.Most of my camera's require 500MA of power and these cables serve them well, however a few of my camera's require 1000MA, and these cables fail to get the power to the camera's. Causing the cameras to flicker at nighttime (when they require the additional power). I have had to replace my cabling with VideoSecu cables to run all camera's without issues."
5,If only the anime series continued with the story,"I really like the FMP series. I have read the mange religiously and watched all the animated series. The novels however, give that little bit more detail and you see the thoughts and feelings of the main characters better within the novels than in any other media. The only bummer with this is that the rest of the series of books are taking too long to come out in English and be accessible by the British public!"
1,the worst cd i've ever heard,"I figured I'd give this cd a go because Johnny Indovina of Human Drama produced it and co-wrote a song. My expectations weren't terribly high, as I'm not a big fan of the whole Christian Death cartel, but nevertheless, they were crushingly dissapointed.The lyrics are skin-crawlingly bad, primarily devoted to Eva's conversion, what a great guy God is, how nifty angels are, and so on. But it isn't as if they drag down the music, or anything. What melodies are here are sacharine and have been done a thousand times before. The musicianship calls up memories of sixth grade band.I would be more specific about tracks, etc. if only I could. I have a clockwork-orange response every time I even think of putting this disc in my stereo.Save yourself the pain."
4,Eva O Fan,This album was pretty good in my opinion. Eva O has a great voice and all of her music comes from the heart. Her most recent album damnation ride the madness is alot better than this one though.
2,Makes CD fine but a lot of noise,"I recently bought this product and had no problem installing the software and hardware. The drive read CD quietly. However, when I burn a CD through a USB 1.1. connection at 6x speed, the drive made noise like an accelarating engine. When I insert the CD into CD-ROM of other PC's, it gave similar noise. Does anyone have similar experience?"
4,better than most,"This is the second pair of work boots that I have bought my husband. These seem to not only fit better, but they have some padding up the back of the heal and ankle. He said that they really fit nice and it took only a few weeks to break them in."
4,Cute Film,I enjoyed this movie! I love Martin and Raven in their roles and thought they did a great job.This is another one of those good home movies with a bag of microwave bag of popcorn.Bottom Line is this is a great family fun home movie!
3,OK FAMILY MOVIE,"IN THIS FAMILY COMEDY,MELANIE (RAVEN SYMONE) IS EARGELY LOOKING FORWARD TO HER FIRST BIG STEP TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE WHEN SHE PLANS A FIRLS ONLY ROAD TRIP TO CHECK OUT PROSPECTIVE UNIVERSITIES. BUT WHEN HER OVERBEARING POLICE CHIEF FATHER (MARTIN LAWRENCEl INSISTS ON ESCORTING HER INSTEAD, SHE SOON FINDS HER DREAM TRIP FULL OF COMICAL MISFORTUNE AND TURMOIL."
3,Cute Family Movie,"The kids really like this, cause of the slapstick. Interesting story about an overprotective dad and how he learns to let go of his firstborn and let her go to the college she wants. It would have been more fun for me if they were able to play up the ""Three Little Pigs"" aspect a bit more that they set up in the beginning of the film. The part of Don Osmond and also his family is so funny -- he just completely upstages Martin Lawrence."
3,"""That's A Great Dad"" ~ Calculating The Distance Between Here And Far From Home","`College Road Trip' released in '08 is another slick Walt Disney Production that offers its audience 83 minutes of amusing and harmless, albeit mindless family entertainment that any self respecting adult should not be watching unless in the presence of a child under the age of 10. The scenarios are predictable and unoriginal and yet there's still enough magic in the old Disney vault to somehow make it work nonetheless.I hate to say it but in my opinion the best sequences in the film revolve around the life-sized grinning Cheshire cat better known as Donny Osmond. His totally insane, off-the-wall performance was so far out there that it added a surreal atmosphere to an otherwise ordinary storyline.Watch this one with a room filled with children. At least you'll enjoy seeing them have a good time even if you don't."
4,Love this movie,"This movie is totally hilarious, my wife says that the Donnie Osmond part reminds her of me LOL, so bogus"
3,Cute Family Movie,This is a cute movie the entire family can sit down and watch together. That is a hard thing to find in this day of reality shows. It is predictable but cute.
5,College Road Trip dvd,We took our son on his own college road trip this year and watched this dvd while on the road. We could relate! It's funny and well worth the purchase. Also received it in a timely fashion from the seller.
3,What was Donny Thinking?,"I guess a pay check is a paycheck and Donny has earned the right to work on what ever tickles his fancy at the time, I understand it was a great time on the set. Personally, I think Donny should stick to singing, live shows and musical theater. It looked like he was having a great time and it was wonderful to see him on screen and to see his name in the credits but the movie was a real stinker. Not my type of film or humor. I gave it three stars because Donny is in it."
1,unappealing to most,"This movie is geared for a specific audience of pre-teen girls, and if you are not in that target group, this movie is quite stupid. I didn't find it funny. Martin Lawerence plays an overprotective father whose daughter is going to college. He wants her to go to school close to home, but she wants to go to Georgetown. They decide to take a road trip to Georgetown for her interview. Her young brother and his pet pig hitch a ride too, and they must overcome several mishaps to get to Georgetown in time for the interview. From skydiving to a pig on caffeine; it was just silly.FINAL VERDICT: A terrible Disney film."
4,As advertised,"The pistachios were good, with free shipping it costs rougly the same as bulk bags at the local supermarket."
1,"Moldy taste, worm tracks, stale...","Man, these are some of the worst pistachios I've ever had. There are always a few bad ones in any bag, but so many in each of these. Even the best ones in the bag didn't taste very good. Have to look at each one before you eat it!"
4,Perfect for snacks - and you can eat the whole bag!,"I love pistachios - and the health benefits - but when I got a big bag of them, I'd almost always eat too many. These are great for eatching just enough but not too much."
4,Flatland the Movie -- a truly original work of art,"for those of us who have read Flatland by Edwin Abbott, this movie is a real treat. for everyone else, you SHOULD read the book, but maybe the movie is enough. i vote for both, and may geometry prosper (thanks to Euclid)."
2,Goofy and hard to watch,"I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. It had the annoying tone of a Saturday morning cartoon."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased both this DVD and Flatland the Movie with Martin Sheen and other well known actors doing the vocals. The other movie (the one with Martin Sheen) is far superior.This film stretches out the plot to the point where my wife fell asleep and I had to watch it over 2 days. The female voices are annoyingly screeching and the female characters are portrayed in an offensive misogynistic manner.I know that filmmakers take liberties with the plot of books turned into films but this one does so in nonsensical ways that really distort the fantastic meaning of Edwin Abbot's classic novel, which is really sad because the graphics in this production are quite good and the book Flatland is a perfect idea for a movie.I highly recommend that you buy the other movie Flatland (the one with Martin Sheen).John Wells, PhD (Mathematics)"
5,Abbotts Classic comes to life...Finally,"Decades have passed since enjoying ""Flatland"". It was required reading for a College Class. The introduction to a different way of thinking about the Universe and Infinity was my reward. My Love for Mathematics was forged in a Smithy of bewilderment during the first few pages. My awareness of the World described in simple Euclidean Geometry has expanded to embrace the Beauty of the plane of existence we inhabit. The film was simple but subtle in a way that both theoreticians and laymen can enjoy. I think about ""Flatland"" every Day. This Film is a wonderful diversion that will be viewed over and again."
2,As disappointing as the Movie,"Like Flatland the Movie, the Film is also disappointing. It is not as slick as the Movie; it is more experimental and less conservative. But it's far too long and it is often tedious. And as far as content goes, it is as unoriginal as the Movie."
5,Thought-provoking... and funny at times,"This is, undoubtedly, one of the most innovative and bizarre films I've seen lately, and I can tell you I see a few every week!The graphics are just wonderful - probably not so high-tech as you can see in some stupidly expensive Hollywood productions, but who needs those when the beauty is in what those flat characters say and show us! Well, maybe those who don't have anything to say...The use of the different dimensions and the explanations that the characters use to make us understand are of the highest level -- lucid and intelligent, it's a really thought-provoking film, one of those few left out there!...And what's more, it's even funny at times!"
3,Well...,"This movie is not bad, but not great, i did buy it thinking it would be a 3d movie, But most of the movie is cartoon with about 15 min at the end is 3d. People who know nothing about flatland will probably not like it and have no clue what the rest of us are watching and think we are retarded. The 3d graphics are okay, but i think they spin too much. Once in the 3d world the camera almost never stops revolving around the characters. If you could i would suggest to rent it but you can only buy it. I wish it was better because i know how long they put into making this."
2,I'll wait for the movie as opposed to the film,"Great graphics, terrible story line. Way far from the original book. I helped a little with ""Flatland the Movie"" and it's much better, although much more expensive for the educational edition."
2,all show and no tell,"Nice visuals, poor vocals.Too bad, this sucks out mostof the drama.The bizarre intro music alertsthe viewer to prepare for somethinguneven."
1,Disturbing,"Started watching the film and had to stop. I thought its treatment of females, subservient creatures with shrill piercing voices, was added by the filmmaker. Pulled the book off the shelf and started reading and found it's all from the book! Which is gratuitously contemptuous of women who are called the Frail Sex that are ""wholly devoid of brainpower."" And a whole lot of other put-downs.The film follows the book closely, and both are badly flawed. Which is a shame since I've always treasured the book for its explanation of other dimensions. I wish someone would take this concept and write a totally different story line."
5,brings back memories,"big george, i'll bet your bosses wish your acr's and pcr's were as well written as this fine book. it was and is an honor to have you as a partner. i remember andy as a student at st. vinny's. i'm glad to see that he too is a top rate medic. ""pick up your jobs, you skells"" stay safe and congratulations. john"
2,Poor,I was disappointed with my purchase. It is not very well written. The quality is poor for the cost.
1,paramedic buff to burn,A dreadfully written book about a paramedic with an ego problem !I don't recommend this to anyone. Save your money !
1,"no attention ""Steal""","I'm a Paramedic...just couldn't get into it, even bored on a 12 hour unproductive shift! I just couldn't get into it. I found my self skimming trying to atleast find something remotely intriguing...with no luck!"
2,An enlightening and interesting read...,"I am not exactly sure how I ended up getting the unedited version of your book which was a bit difficult to read, but it was an interesting autobiography just the same. I laughed at a few of the analogies that were definate truisms that define the differences between the new buff and the older experienced medics. Also interesting is how New York presents experiences that are unique to many other services, cities and working environments.Mr. Steffensen my suggestion to you is to continue to write your view of the EMS world according to George with future editions, assure that all your work is properly edited to make you shine in the academic light that becomes you, and expound upon your thoughts, feelings, and concerns about how society has created each situation that you become involved with. Thank you for doing the work that you do and for sharing your experiences in our book."
5,Paramedic Buff to Burnt,"This book was and excellent reading tool. George has created a wonderful outlook to the gritty street life of the average paramedic. Being a paramedic myself, I can relate to the differet situation that this book offered. I felt very strong emotions to the street life. This book has opened up a entire new world to me, i felt as if i was on the outside looking into my own life. I would recommend that every paramedic and EMT read this book. EXCELLENT reading!!! a five star plus."
3,"Good stories, but in dire need of an editor.","The stories in this book are fantastic. Steffensen isn't shy about honestly disclosing his faults and failings, as well as triumphs. Unfortunately, the quality of writing is sub-par. These are written in the way that one talks. Stories have no continuity between them and often are poorly paginated.Like another commenter, my impression was that I was reading a draft version, a very early draft at that."
5,Wonderful tales of the sea!,"If you've never stood on deck and smelled fresh salt, if you haven't felt the surf break around your feet at the shore, get this book and you'll be hooked! Great illustrations and photographs are surrounded by scintillating writing from an author who obviously has had a long love affair with the ocean. This book may be non-fiction but it will grip your interest as much as any of the great classic sea novels."
5,Fascinating book!,"I can't praise this book enough for it's content. Perhaps it's more interesting to me for having grown up on the Jersey shore, and being familiar with the places mentioned, but I really did not want to put this book down. It covers all the history of shipwrecks and the efforts to save crew members. I discovered so many facts that I never knew - now I'm a shipwreck buff! I was sorry this book had to end; if there was ever a sequel, I'm buying it!"
1,does not fit a 93 mercury capri,"this item does not fit a 93 mercury capri , it is the wrong item and wrong fit please refraim from selling stuff and wasting peoples money"
3,Alien Sex Fiend - Drive my rocket,"Not a bad place to start. Has clssic ASF ""hits"" like 'I walk the line' and 'Now I'm feeling zombiefied.' Only place besides 1987s' ""Here Cum Germs"" album you can get 'Isolation,' One of a few goth songs ASF has...and by FAR the best."
5,Awsome!,This Book Is Awsome. Its so Easy to read AndI think u should buy it Its just like the show! If u read #1 its the Series. And theres Some parts Are NOt for kids... I Say not to let anybody under 10 read it.
5,BUY IT!BUY IT!BUY IT!,"Whoa!!I bought this book with #3 at a Borders in Maine and when I read it at home-WOO-HOO!!!Now I've only read volumes 1-4[which I own,they rock!],but I think this is the best DBZ volume ever!!!(At least 'til Gotenks comes out)=)BY the way,there will be 26 DBZ volumes total."
5,A Must See,"I knew the Joffrey was different and were agents of change in the world of dance, but had no idea of the rich back story. This is an interesting documentary that you will want to watch much more than once and own."
5,very interesting and informative,Very interesting dvd relating all the history behind the Geoffrey ballet and the Harkness ballet company. I enjoyed the dancing and the interviews of the dancers and choregraphs.Dany
1,Sometimes you order an item by mistake,"Not exactly what i wanted. It's just a plastic funnel with no parts or any installation. And it's shipped and sold by Amazon.com not third party. And they even busted my $25 order and charged me shipping to a total of $11.83. And for some ungodly reason they will not except returns on this item. IT'S JUST A PLASTIC FUNNEL. NOT HAPPY 'BOUT THIS TRANSACTION. But I understand that this disclaimer is on the item page, after the fact. IT'S JUST A PLASTIC FUNNEL!"
5,Excellent book,"A book that contains excellent research information. I particularly liked the short cut method for screening stocks. Written in an easy-to-follow style. A must have for beginners and intermediate investors, especially those who have little stomach for sifting through a lot of research material."
4,Nice addition to existing literature,"The book deals with the emerging markets' specific problems of investment valuation and financial decisioning. Elementary financial methodologies are modified to capture the different variabeles in emerging markets. It is an easy to read book but I would have liked it to be more in-depth than it is now. It gives, however, a nice structured view on emerging markets valuation theory."
3,The unbearable irrelevance of CF in perpetuity,"At the outset, it is important to mention that my special area of interest is cost of capital with finite cash flows (CF). And in my review, it is this point that I would like to address.In chapter 10, compared to similar books, the author presents a good detailed exposition on the cost of capital. However, my big complaint is that the author assumes that the formulas on the cost of capital that are derived from CF in perpetuity simply carry over to finite CF.In practice, we derive finite cash flows from financial statements and on grounds of simplicity, one may use the formulas from CF in perpetuity. However, it is not self-evident that the formulas from CF in perpetuity are relevant and appropriate to finite CFs. This may or may not be true, but the equivalence certainly needs to be demonstrated with some simple numerical examples."
3,Outrageous Price,The outrageous list price for this item ($70 for 2006 and $75 for the 2008 edition) is a sad comment on the the high price of access to accountability in goverment. Few ordinary voters will want to pay the high price.
3,Excellent resource undermined by Barone's bias,"Mr. Barone has burdened this wonderful resource with a partisan analysis that detracts from a work that should strive for insightful objectivity, or at least consensus centrism."
2,the bias gets worse,"This volume contains a wealth of information, but the bias is ruining it. I could give many examples, but one says it all. Barone claims that Trent Lott is a supporter of civil rights. Say what?"
1,A Once Great Series Contiues Its Slide Down the Tubes,"What was once an indispensable guide to US politics has been steadily ruined over the years by the shrill, sanctimonious editorializing of Michael Barone. I used to by new editions of this series every two years but quit several years ago because I was getting less information and more op-ed preaching. I did pick up a copy of this edition at a local book store and spent a great deal of time flipping thorough it and saw that little has changed. Barone is simply a blind apologists for the Bush administration and contemptuously dismisses anyone who does not subscribe to his philosophy as merely being a part of the ""feminist left.""It is such a shame, as a lot of the information in here is valuable to someone with an interest in US politics and elections. It is too bad Barone's ego has gotten in the way and ruined a once great series."
2,Dissapointed and Let Down,"I was very excited to be browsing the shelves of a SC Barnes and Nobles and find this book. However, two pages into the book I started to become very dissapointed with where the author was going with the story. After living for ten years of my life on a""mill hill"" of South Carolina, I felt this book was not true to the environment and true sense of the area. It's focus was too much on painting a dreamy, all American picture instead of giving it's readers a realistic view and leaving them with a real sense of having been there themselves."
2,Not so sharp as 18-135mm kit,"In general I agree with previous reviwers, but not about sharp. To be sure that it was not my hand that afected the sharp, I did a test. Using a tripod I did a picture with 70-300 at 135mm and after with a 18-135mm (the one that cames with the D80) at 135mm too. The camera used was a D80 with the same adjusts and subject for buth lenses. The 18-135mm is much sharper them 70-300mm at 135mm.For sure I will sell 70-300mm and go to a VR."
4,Very Good Keyboard,"This is a fine, sturdy keyboard that works with ME (despite the previous review). I'm using it on ME right now. You need to download the ME driver from MS though.The key pressure is just right, the size is fine (not too small, not too big). The extra buttons are helpful. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I'd like the wrist rest a little bigger."
4,nice i like the sent,"never used tabac product before my first tabac cream, smells remind me of old barber shop smell, I kind of like it, the price is rite for this product, most shave cream they sell on US are overly priced , if you buy from germany this product is under 2 bucks, well i have no complain against this price including shiping which is good, sent is very good. One should give it a try."
5,Delicious!,"Most flavorful, tasteful cookbook ever! The best up-to-date recipes I have ever tasted! Outstanding!!"
3,academic,"This is a collection of essays with a lot of intellectual ruminating. It is valuable for that reason, providing a collection of writings on commercial food production in one place. It is essential reading for those passionate about sustainability. It is for those who enjoy reading a certain style of writing that I call academic (I'm not one of those people, so I'm not the best judge). For something more approachable (some would call ""pop"") I would recommend Michael Pollan's book The Omnivore's Dilemma."
3,Willis review for wrong book,"Willis' review is for ""Fatal Harvest"" (ISBN 1559639407), NOT ""Fatal Harvest Reader""."
2,i wouldnt buy it if i had known,"i am a huge gladys knight fan but this was a big let down. i anticipated good photography, not great just good. it was barely fair if you like to to see a big fuzzy screen. the sound was awful, very camcorder quality. she sang 3-4 good songs but they were poor sounding so you can imagine the songs that you have never heard before. a lot of hopping around by the pips that made watching gladys very hard to keep track of on stage. they seem to think that people come to watch them rather than her. all in all a very big deal about nothing. i do not want to even go into ray charles."
5,Outstanding Concert,"I have never had the opportunity to see Gladys Knight in her prime in concert, so to see this DVD was a wonderful opportunity to see them live. I was not disappointed, Miss Knight was regal, funny and in full voice - the addition of Ray Charles for the last numbers was a real bonus."
2,Quality Is Poor,"I LOVE Gladys Knight and recently attended ""An Evening With Gladys Knight"" here in Sacramento. I was so looking forward to having a DVD that captured the best of her work, however, I was disappointed in the quality of this DVD. I realize this concert was recorded many years ago, however, this DVD is almost unwatchable. Extremely poor visually, a constant blur - it reminded me of a DVD made from a video copy 3rd generation. Not recommended even for the most devoted Gladys Knight fans."
1,video is pure garbage!,"Please, Gladys Knight fans, do NOT by this DVD. The video is about the worst I have ever seen. I don't have severe problems with the audio, although it is not good. The studio producing these should not be awarded with a purchase. I can't watch the pure fuzz video. I just have to turn off the picture and listen as I would a (somewhat crappy) cd. Word to the wise....steer clear!"
4,Excellent concert! Very poor dvd video quality!,"Five stars for the concert!!! However, since the dvd quality is so poor I had to give it 4 stars. The musical content is so great, it would be unfair (IMHO), to give this dvd a poor rating. Seeing the Pips grand stepping choreography as they sing along with Gladys is a keeper! Then, to see and hear Ray Charles is awesome....especially when he sings America the Beautiful!!!Note: whoever wrote the liner notes got their info wrong! Merald ""Bubba"" Knight is Gladys's brother!!! NOT her cousin!!!!"
5,An excellent documentary,"I thought this was a fascinating movie. Using both Soviet and Nazi propaganda footage, the director was able to give you a feel for the desperate times in which Vlasov lived. The interviews with survivors of Vlasov's Liberation Army really made the film though. This is an aspect of WWII that is often either glossed over or else made to sound as if THIS the key to defeating Stalin, raising a Russian Army to fight against Bolshevism. The truth is probably somewhere in between."
3,Quite well done but lacks depth - even so worth a look,"I am fascinated by the Second World War and especially by the Nazi-Soviet conflict which dominated the struggle against Hitler's Germany. I am also very interested in the subject of this documentary, renegade Soviet General Vlasov. So I should have liked the film - and I did. BUT, for those not already steeped in the subject of the fight between Hitler's regime and Stalin's, it lacks sufficient background material and explanation. Also some of the technical quality was occasionally inadequate. Fascinating topic: could have been handled better. Nevertheless, for those interested in the Second World War, worth one look at least ."
4,Toy tractor,The tractor appears to be durable and was very easy to assemble. It was really hard for my 2 year old gradson to pedal inside but worked great on the side walk. Would have been nice to have a few more items that simulated the actual John Deer. Good purchase for a growing kid.
4,Childs surprise,Perfect gift and the right surprise. Spends many moments playing the mechanic and the lawn care professional pretending he has a grown up toy
2,Steering,"Steering wheel was drilled out too much it is loose. Wheels spin on concrete dry concrete. For the money not impressed. The company does not offer parts, they said take it back where I bought it!!!"
1,don't waste your money!,"i ordered this on line for one of my 4 year old twin sons. it is a piece of junk! i ordered for my other twin the john deere loader - it is made by a different company and is so much better. i just returned this item and ordered another loader.this toy has only 1 wheel drive, the front wheels spin and the steering is hard and inconsistent. my son was so anxiously awaiting this toy and was so disappointed especially when he saw how great the loader worked.if you are looking for a tractor, i really recommend the john deere loader by peg perego for the same price."
3,Quality toy,"We purchased for my son's 3rd birthday but quite honestly, I think we were premature in doing so. Possibly we failed to read the specifications and other reviews?! The reason I say this is my son, who is in the higher growth %s was unable to reach the pedals. We've actually ended up storing this in the attic for the past year since he was unable to ride it. We're hoping he will be able to use it this spring/summer. Appears to be of high quality. Wish it had actual buttons to push but love how it actually resembles the same model my husband has, of which my son adores. Highly recommend but encourage parents to check out the specifications to make sure your child is tall enough to use the pedals."
3,/Assembly of JD Plastic Pedal Tractor,The prepunched holes were not clear of plastic. A drill had to be used to clear the pastic so that assembly could be completed. The steering column assembly was the most difficult. Several hours were needed to complete the assembly of the tractor. A very determined grandfather would not give up! Quality control needs great improvement.The completed product is a delight to our grandchild and especially to his paternal grandmom and great-grandmom. His paternal great-granddad was a farmer.
4,"Good, but bloated","This book is actually really good. I thought Database programming and design would be one of the most boring things I've ever studied in my life, but with this book it was actually quite interesting. They would do well to trim off about 200 pages, but otherwise it's good. I don't like the fact that the book holds your hand so much, but I guess it's understandable since the target audience is people who have never done any database programming. If you're looking for a good introductory book to dealing with SQL Server from a non API standpoint (as in dealing directly with the Enterprise Manager, etc), then you can't really go wrong with this book."
3,"Good Breadth, Average Depth","As has already been stated this is not a reference book. I think the author has covered quite a bit in this book but I think the ""Professional"" in the title is a little misleading. It doesn't quite have the technical depth I would consider to be ""Professional"". It also has a writing style is more along the lines of a ""Dummies Guide"" then a ""Professional"" programming book. In the end it depends what you are looking for."
4,Good Book to Own,Title is correct. It is a professional manual for SQL Server 2000. Not for those without formal training although there are usable snippets in the book.
5,Outstanding,"I worked my way through a number of SQL books while studying for my MCDBA and this is, without a doubt, the best SQL book I've owned. The coverage is extensive and very thorough and the examples are very clear. I have it on my reference shelf at work and it's one I keep referring to whenever I need a quick explanation or want to get pointed in the right direction."
3,Stuck to my earlier edition,"I agree with the reviewer Wendt, who complained that this book is too much like its earlier edition. I borrowed a copy of this new edition and compared it to my copy of the previous. Partly 'cus I was wondering if I needed to upgrade.But not really. Wendt is correct. If you already have an earlier copy, then you should save some money and stick with that. The extra new stuff here is pretty minor."
3,Good book for beginners,"The author certainly knows his topic and writes as though he were standing in front of a class teaching off the top of his head, he's good and I got quite a bit from this book but...You could cull 200 pages from this novel and still convey all the same information, it's very wordy - a bit too wordy for me. I found it a little slow. Once a concept is explained, the author tends to dwell on it for a few more pages discussing the finer details, some of which I thought were fairly obvious and really didn't need the depth of investigation they got and I frequently found myself skipping ahead.Overall it is a good book but be prepared to spend some time working through it."
2,This is NOT Programming book,This a book about SQL Server architecture and some new features. Too many pictures to make it as thick as possible.TO AUTHOR and PUBLISHER: We do not want to hold 1200 page book that should have been 500 page book.
1,Not a good reference book,"For such a thick, heavy book, this one just doesn't seem to have much worthwhile content in it... lotta screen shots though. I basically bought this hoping to use it as a reference. This book is not a reference book at all. ""o man, I forgot what order to put the arguements of the DATEADD function in... where do I look?"" To make things easy to find, it's mentioned in the table of contents as one of the first topics in the Views section. His book on SQL 7 was better than this one. Looking at the picture on the cover gives me a headache too."
2,big disappointment!!!,"big disappointment!!!! for programmers that are looking for Programming ODBC SQL Server Applications... no covering at all for general database access APIs (odbc,oledb....)"
2,Decent but flawed,"This book has some good info, but the book itself has many flaws.First, much of the info is copied verbatim from the 7.0 book. That would be OK if this were a second edition, but it is being sold as a whole new book.Second, half the book consists of printouts of the screens from the various Sql Server tools. For example, the DTS and replication coverage consists almost entirely of screen printouts. Some pages are literally two screen prints with a sentence or two between them. One gets the impression the Rob hasn't used these technologies much and is using graphics to bulk up the book.Regardless of the reasons for the flaws, they greatly devalue the book for me. I would say that if you have the 7.0 book, you don't need this one. Also, keep in mind that if you are working with DTS, replication, XML, OLAP and many others you will need other books unless you simply want to review printouts of Sql Server screen printouts."
3,Not bad not good,In general the book is ok. The author needed to make more research in some areas and not made use only of his own experience.He does not mention about the issues with no following ANSI 92. The stored procedures and the trigger parts are really boring.Sometimes the book is good but the author likes to move into areas he should not or he is not proficient enough. His comments on normalization and security are sometimes so strong that I tend to think that this guy is watching just one side of the coin.Ed
1,Very disappointing for a name brand product,"Extremely messy, does NOT bond well to any surface, hard to clean up and has the most horrible vinegar like odor i've ever smelled/ I would not recommend this product."
2,Look Elsewhere,I don't feel it is stron enough. It doesn't hold well. I would look elsewhere if I needed more sealant like this.
5,Great video!,"This is a great video showing Jeff's multitude of talents at the Height of his career. Fantastic musician, singer and you can tell just a great guy to play music with! I miss his music, his style and his personality. This video will get you smiling, singing and maybe even dancing!"
2,2 and a half stars...Is this just my copy...,"Or am I the only one who noticed that Jeff's guitar was extremely low in the audio feed (of the 1999 concert portion)? I could see him playing, but even when the band gets mezzo or softer, nada. Very disappointing. Will sample the CD for a better mix. It's a pleasure to watch him dance and scorch, but the audio has to be just as satisfying. Well, at least Paddy sounds exceptional..."
2,Deflates while I'm sleeping!,"Given what I paid for this, I have been very careful. I bought it for a guest, but started using it as my everyday bed because it's more comfortable than my old, flat futon mattress.Recently, I started noticing that in the middle of the night, the mattress was deflating. If I sat up, my rump was touching the ground! I removed all of the bedding to find the hole...none that I can see with the naked eye.Now my sleep routine includes waking up and re-inflating my sinking ""raft.""I'm disappointed and don't plan on buying another Aerobed given other options that are out there now. I think a real sofabed will be more cost effective."
1,Selling products not in stock,Indicated that the product was in stock (both at Amazon and on their own site) while the product was back-ordered by several weeks.This is an unacceptable business practice.
5,A Practical and FUN guide to InDesign,"From the moment I opened Publishing With InDesign I was drawn to the author's no-nonsense approach to applying the software. He cuts to the chase with an informative, concise narrative that helps make a very complex layout program approachable.Especially usefully are the projects presented throughout the book. I found them to clearly emphasize the capabilities of the program. They were fun to do and they gave me confidence to attempt large-scale, complicated projects almost immediately. I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking to get and stay current with one of the newest and most powerful softwares on the market."
1,Worst Ever,"This is by far the worst book on software and publishing I have ever read. Not only is filled with pretentious opinions of the author, who continually reminds us how much experience, but it never gets into the software it's supposed to be about. It's more about graduating from office secretarial design, (maybe using PageMaker) to commercial publishing. The books is badly designed itself, and poorly written, with poor typography to boot. It offers next to nothing about the program InDesign and most of its other content seems to be recirculated PageMaker publishing advice. (Getting It Printed is much better for publishing information.) I have never felt so ripped off in my life."
5,Stellar Performances,"I would pay the price for just the bonus CD. If you are a fan of any one of these players-This is a must have!!!!!This is some of the most inspired playing I have ever encountered- Don't miss out on this limited pressing!Robin Pirson (Toronto,Canada)"
2,Good...but not great...,"I have this laptop since dec '04 and its getting heated up just too much....i had to buy a cooler, and while watching a movie or listening to songs...it gets heated up even much faster and the other programs running in the background are noticeably slower. The wireless is quite good at times and poor other times....it gets disconnected, but the reception is good and the battries...not good....the company should say tht the battries will work for the first 3-4 months.....after tht it gets discharged after about 15-20 mins...i need to take the power cable everywhere i go."
5,The Best Laptop Ever,"I love this laptop. I was diagnosed with a Degenerative Disc disease. The doctor said that carrying too much weight will cause more pain in my back. After buying this laptop the pain vanished thanks to this lightweight notebook pc. Weight plays a negative factor when it come to notebook pc's. If anyone want to undue the increased back pain get this laptop and you'll see the difference. However, the hardware and software are excellent as well. I am a member of the U.S. Air Force and I travel a lot. My Averatec laptop go everywhere I go with no problems as far as connectivity. Most of all my back feel terrific. It's really pleasing for a consumer to enjoy the pleasure of his/her product without any uncomforting expectations. I've told all my friends and co-workers, they love this laptop too."
2,get the centrino,"I've had this computer for 3 months now, and while the size is perfect for bringing everywhere, it's bad when you want to go wireless. I've been in many places with free wifi and my connection signals have always been poor. I've sat besides other people with their Centrino powered computers, and their signals were so much stronger. In some places, I could not even get a decent signal while others were surfing comfortably. The batteries are clearly inferior, so if I were you get a different brand. If not, go for the Centrino powered. Believe me you'll be grateful you did."
3,"Not too bad, but...","I recently bought one of these from Amazon.com. It appears to be a really nice unit, but it has 1 glaring problem. The internal wireless network adapter is non-functional. I was unable to get it to connect to my existing 802.11g network using Windows XP's zero configure support, but I was able to identify it as being a Ralink mini-PCI card, and downloaded (using the internal ethernet adapter, which works fine) current drivers direct from Ralink. No Go, either with Windows zero configure or using the proprietary software from Ralink. I eventually disabled the internal card and got a SMC PCMCIA 802.11g card, which works like a champ. Problem solved. NOTE: You must completely uninstall the Ralink driver software if you are going to use the SMC card, otherwise you get intermittent hard crashes -- the machine completely shuts down and reboots spontaneously, every couple of hours or so."
3,Averatec 3200 series,"Fast, slim, light and convenient. I miss a parallel port though. CMOS battery went within 2 weeks. Get AVERATEC or Amazon to commit to a warranty - notice that none is posted."
5,An amazing reference work,"Ms. O'Hare and her assistants spent an amazing amount of quality reference time putting together a stellar work that details every legal exectution in the State of California. The only drawback to this book is the cost, which puts it out of reach for all but libraries and serious scholars. Great work!!"
3,"'Trance Europe: Electronic Body Experience, Volume 1' (Cleopatra) Various Artists","Ten obscure / sub-underground bands of the techno and trance field. Most of these bands appear to have out just one song out and available - which is most likely 'exclusive' to the particular Cleopatra label release. Ensembles that I happen to like the most were Hyperborea, Komikano, Alternative Energy and Transformer (which is the exception on this various artists CD - because they look to have a couple of actual CD's out there somewhere - not necessarily readily easy-to-find). For me 'Trance Europe Electronic Body Experience' isn't all that great, but it's okay. Something you pull occasionally for a spin."
2,Early 90's House/Trance?,"""Trance Europe"" is a collection of music that is billed to represent electronic music. The song ""Energy 2"" by Alternative Energy is an ok song. However, I was hoping for more experimentation with the songs and lyrics. As a result, this cd would only be for those who may be looking for other qualities besides experimentation."
3,Take Off!,"A rather sweet little 'accompaniment' to the 70s television series starring Nicholas Jones. However, it tends to get rather boring at times- especially the first few chapters; it isn't really until the main character, Alan Farmer, joins the Royal Flying Corps during WW1 that it starts to get interesting- and then it ends rather abruptly! The thin paperback book is definately filled with far too much 'padding' and doesn't get to the point quick enough! Though, if you enjoyed the series, you will probably enjoy the book- and it is a must for all World War One Entusiasts!"
1,This is God Awful..,"I am a big fan of the beatles, in my 50's and was looking forward to a lot of interviews with the Beatles themselves. WOW was I disappointed... Screaming fans waiting to see the beatles... Lots of minutes of this... the interviews the box set does have are for the most part easily accesible on other DVD's. 90% of the interviews on this these DVD's are such poor quality, they are broken up, have intervals of loud static that drowned out everything else, poor visual quality obviously bootleged by someone with no knowledge of what they were doing, all in all irritating. I am usualy not one to complain, but this was far beyond bad... it was a discusting misrepresentation... it is advertised as 1200 minutes of rare material... yea, rare because who wants to watch fans waiting out side homes, the Beatles have rented, being interviewed by repoters over and over... Stay far away from this DVD,, heck I will sell you mine for postage."
1,Any one with this problem,I rented to this set to preview it. So far discs 2 & 3 (#2 replaced twice) I can't play the second item on the menu. Just waits and then stops. Can't use the chapters to go through it either same thing happens.I would buy this but don't want it if this is going to happen. Has anyone who bought it having problems.I know DVD's you can't return after opening. Looking to avoid problems.
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"We bought this camera for our daughter's 6th birthday, she was so happy and spent all day taking pictures of everything. Then I tried to put the pictures on the computer and all I got was 11 pictures of rainbows, every picture blurred so bad they were just streaks of colored light - the quality is HORRIBLE, you can hardly make out what the pcture is supposed to be of - this was even the case when I took a picture (and I placed the camera on a bookshelf to avoid it moving while taking the picture).The software is a problem to install and use. When I tried to upload the pictures they remain on the camera so you can easily fill it up and not be able to use.overall this was a huge disappointment, save your money and avoid this agrevating product."
2,False Advertising,"The box says it has an LCD display, but that only shows the number of photos taken. Not the actual photo."
2,"Not ""user friendly"" for any age let alone children","I bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste. The camera was much smaller than expected, trying to figure out what mode you're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret. Nothing is a simple ""one step"" procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children. I was so frustrated setting it up that I didn't bother giving it to her. The software installed okay but was also far from ""kid friendly"". I wish I would've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase. Ironically, the reviews I did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids. I believe you'd be better off purchasing a ""regular"" inexpensive digital camera for your potential ""shutterbugs""."
1,Complete waste of money,This camera takes virtually worthless pictures and the camera settings are very difficult to change/adjust. The included instructions are a joke. Save you money to buy something else.
1,Complete ripoff,"This camera is basically unusable. I installed all of the drivers and software exactly the way the instructions said to and am unable to download any pictures from the camera. It asks me for an executable file that apparently was not included on the software CD nor is available on the manufacturers website. I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times to no effect. It functions as a terrible webcam at this point and nothing else. I am not asking for the best camera in the world to give to my 4 year old daughter, but it would be nice to be able to retrieve the photos at some point. Do not buy this camera under any circumstances."
1,don't waste your money,"Poor picture quality and uses batteries much too fast.Also, I could not get my computer to work with this camera. I'm not sure if it's the computer (HP Pavilion) or the operating system (Windows Vista). I used a friend's computer that runs XP and everything worked but quality was poor. I'd recommend getting an inexpensive ""real"" camera for your kid instead."
1,"Bad implementation, Bad design","The lack of and LCD to view a picture is pretty bad. The controls consist of two button which must be pushed in different combinations to make the work. For example, to turn on the flash, push button 1 three times, then push button 2. The pictures are of poor quality and the software is difficult for little ones. Trying to connect more that one of these cameras to the same computer (but at different times) resulted in the 2nd camera not being recognized and put into a hung state, resulting in the loss of all the pictures.Avoid!"
1,SUPER JUNK,"Gift for 10 year old daughter, wotrthless piece of junk. Will try to return it to toys r us. WE GOT IT FOR FREE & ITS WORTHLESS!"
1,lost all our photos,"my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures of her and her baby sister in san francisco. we put new batteries in that morning. the next day i was wondering why the picture numbers had reset. when i tried to download the pictures to my computer, they were all gone, and the battery icon was flashing. based on what i've read here, it appears the batteries died after one day of use and the pictures were all erased. the picture quality is about the same as an old camera phone -- pretty poor, but good enough for my 5-year to enjoy. but what good is that when there aren't even any pictures the next day. i'm hoping the store will take it back."
1,JUNK!,This item should be taken off the shelves. Had to buy a precision screw driver set because the screws holding the battery compartment shut are so small. Terribly difficult to operate. Terrible pictures! I got my money back and paid an extra $25 fot the Fisher Price Kid Tough Camera...my three year old can operate the new one easily and is taking very good pictures with it. The Fisher Price model also has an lcd on the back to review your shots and accepts SD memory card...spend the extra cash!
1,I don't usually leave reviews BUT...,"I would hate anyone else to fall into the same problems we have had with this camera. Especially because this product is intended for a child, they will be so disappointed if they receive this horrible camera.We bought this for my daughter to take on a field trip with school. Thankfully we tried to download the software and use the camera before she went on her trip, otherwise we would have had one disappointed little girl to have taken so many pictures that we can't get off the camera!We will be looking into a much better product or just a standard camera for her trip. The unfortunate part is the distributors already have our money and that's all they care about, rather than delivering a good product. I can't stand corporations like this one, SO DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CAMERA!!! DO NOT GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THESE THEIVES!"
5,Wonderful,Used this fiction book with my unit on the Quabbin Reservoir. We used several pages as the basis for journal writing for this time in history.
5,the best book I ever read,"Someday by Jackie French Koller is the best book I've read so far that is good from the begining to the end it is about Celie Wheeler,her Mother,Gram and her best friend Cubby who live in Enfield during 1938 which was flooded to create a reservoir for Bosten read the book and find out what happens"
3,A Time-Less movie that takes place in a Dream-like world,"A few things first. Yes this film is confusing, and the dialouge is not the best it ""can"" be. But this film which has no set time in the setting is quite interesting as it tells that no matter where you are and in any time period you are in, as long as there are at least 2 strong nations, deceit, tragety, and violence never vanish. Rome or the Goths are irrelevant, Rome can be replaced with the U.S, or Izreal or anything. This was a quite powerful film incorporating a significant amount of symbolism. I like this film but I think this film can be compressed quite a bit, and the dialouge as I have mentioned wasn't top-notch.However there is one BIG problem with this movie,... It runs too slow and thus you will NEVER miss anything! so... this movie ""might"" insult your intellegence.+forgive the horrible spelling and grammer ^_^;;"
4,a MUST SEE for visual arts students,"This movie is a visual feast for the eyes, as well as an interesting look into the darker side of Julie Taymor's genius. If you are fascinated by costume design, scenery, production design, art direction, lighting and color, this is a movie you should watch at least once. Pay particular attention to the blending of architecture and costume from Mussolini's Fascist Italy of the 1930s with that of ancient Imperial Rome. There is almost no over-the-top CGI; you are looking at real streets, real actors, real props, giving the feeling of watching a play on film rather than an over-produced special effects pageant.The play itself is one of the most brutal & bloody works of Shakespeare (war, rape, mutilation, murder, and oh yes, cannibalism) and has received mixed reviews over the years, but what a magnificent & gory canvas for Miss Taymor's artistic vision."
3,Taymor seems completely unschooled in the basics of lensing a film,"Great acting, interesting direction of actors, and outstanding music, dragged down by director's rather starved competence as a filmmaker."
1,Pretentious Crud,"After reading the play Titus Andronicus and hearing so much good word of mouth about the movie I decided to pick it up. What a waste of my time. I should have known something was wrong the minute the movie opened, not in Rome but in ""Rome"" a neo-european farce of an empire. While its nice that Taymor tried to bring a modern feel to the film it just ruined the entire preceedings. As I saw people spitting out shakesperean lines while getting into their cadillacs. All together I have to say that Taymor could have had one of two things, a shakespearean movie with shakesperean language and A REAL ROME. Or a farce of rome and a farce of the language. But not a mix of the two. This is experimental to a fault, and totally ruined the film for me."
1,IT WAS DISGUSTING,"I just wanted to write this review to let people know that if you are easily impressed by blood and gore, DO NOT watch this film!!!I had to see it for one of my classes and it was a nightmare-- at points it was so gory it was ridiculous... but I guess that was really the point... to make exaggeration funny.So please be careful because it's very very nasty"
1,Oh My oh My......,"It was Horrible with a capital H. Did I say it was horrible? Nay, it was auwful. I did try, I sat through 40 minutes of it, I plomise, I did, I did. But it was torture, I just couldnt anymore. Lets put it this way I love some of Shakespeare's works but to date I cant bring myself to watch DiCaprio's Romeo & Juliet whilst truly loving the 60's Ziferelli version, you know why? coz its 'bastardized' same as this one above. I too expected to see a true Roman production. Dont you just hate it when they do that? No doubt all in the name of ""Art"". Well art like that twas not meant for me. Do yourself a favour and skip this one, unless of course your one of them 'artsy-fartsy' sort, then you might dribble on forever proclaiming to all and sundry how orgasmic it was. Pity they dont have minus 1 star!Was this review helpful to you? If I saved you $10+ you bet it was lol."
1,This must be an acquired taste.,"If you like other films featurng Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, or Julie Taymor, you may end up hating this one. This movie starts out with a young boy staging a battle on his kitchen table with lots of action figures covered in catsup, and lots of other condiments. The next thing you know, the boy is carried into an ancient stadium with a wall of a burning building in it. Then, dozens of blue mud-slathered roman soldiers march in. Not making much sense? Fast-forwarding didn't help. Ejected after about 10 minutes."
2,The mixing of old and new elements doesn't work,"I couldn't go for the mixing of elements. Motorcycles and chariots together? Uh-uh. It doesn't work. It's neither one thing nor the other.And I didn't like having the mute kid running around everywhere. It was annoying.The acting is great; Shakespeare is, well, Shakespeare. Same incredible depth of characters, even supporting characters who, sometimes, suddenly leave off their character, inexplicably developing a momentary conscience which they never had before. I suppose that'd be my only complaint about the genius himself.But really, this adaptation, this mixing of armored track vehicles with Goth and Roman helmets--it just doesn't do it.It distracts more than anything."
1,Unfortunate,"I'm afraid I have to agree with another reviewer that the ""time shift"" employed here completely destroys the story. This movie would chase cars if you left in on the portch!"
1,aaagh!,this was the most boring movie I have seen for a LONG time. The quintessential 'arty' movie that critics praise because they don't understand it. just awful
3,A Missed Classic,"I saw this movie in an arthouse movie house a few years ago and it has stuck in my mind ever since the movie itself is based on the shakespear play. But it is the vivid images which will haunt you after you see the movie. Hopkins is outstanding as the lead so is Lange as his nemis, but it is Harry Lennix who plays the moore that steals the show. the opening scene of the roman soilders returning form battle with the Goths in to the collisium is superb when it is mixed with the images of the child playing out of cotrol with his toys.In my opion it is a great movie and a truely exceptional disc for extras. I can't rate this movie highly enough."
2,TITUS the movie,"The ordering, price, and delivery of the movie ""Titus"" was excellent. Good communication between Amazon and me was also excellent; it was as if Amazon really cares about the customer and product. However, the one thing that they did not take into consideration was that the product was going to Australia. As it was my first time at ordering something ONLINE I have learnt valuable lessons about ordering on the net. For a start the product ""The movie Titus"" seems to be totally useless with it being incompatible with Australia DVD players. How one establishes if the product being purchased is compatible to Australian electronics seems to be beyond me... being an aged person (or an Old Fart as my kids say) it may take me some time to figure this out. I was about to purchase more products online but after my Blue-ray DVD player rejecting Titus I will not be purchasing any further products until I find out the ""do's & don'ts"" about buying on the net."
5,A Spellbinding Action Thriller,"Yes, I'm talking about William Shakespeare. This is a griping story about power politics, egomania, treason, misplaced loyalties, conspiracy, promiscuity, deception, revenge and murder with a little bit of cannibalism thrown in.Anthony Hopkins' Titus Andronicus ranks with the best of the modernized Shakespeare performances like Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, Leonardo Di Caprio's Romeo, and Ian McKellan's incredible Richard III. You don't already have to be a Shakespeare fan to get hooked. This film, like the others mentioned, will grab you and it won't let go.The script may be classic literature but I still think it is strictly adult entertainment. Jessica Lange does the last nude scene I think you are ever going to see her in plus the action is a bit gory. If you don't want the kids watching orgies, murder and tragic insanities you might want to wait till you are alone to screen it."
3,Titus interruptus,"Don't get too comfortable, and put away your popcorn. It's a two-hour and forty minute LSD trip with a truckload of nightmarish visions and hellish scenes. Excellent art direction, but this least-performed play of Shakepeare exhausts the senses. A real quirky treat for Hopkins and Lange fans. Johnny Carson would call this ""weird, wacky stuff"". Forget about renting a copy, this one was made specifically for the big screen."
5,This is Great,"I have seen several Shakespeare adaptations, but this one is clearly the best. I was not familiar with the story of Titus before I saw this film and I had no trouble following it. The true test of conveying Shakespeare(in my humble opinion) is telling the story without the losing the audience in the diologue. Titus accoplishes this. It is visually spectacular and the performances by Anthony Hopkins and crew are wonderful. The story, though, is what makes Titus so amazing. I won't spoil it for you, but if you like truely twisted tales, then by all means check out this film. You will not be dissapointed."
5,A Thrilling Masterpiece From Start To Finish.,"What more can i add that has not been already said in the above reviews. This is truly an amazing movie,the direction is incredible the acting by all the cast is superb and the story is thrilling from begining to end. Hopkins delivers another amazing part sometimes resembling a real ""Hannibal""( see the movie and you will see what i mean)! Jessica Lange also portrays a smart and sexy part throughout the whole movie keeping the audience alert all the time. Alan Cumming gives us probably his best to date performace in this movie keeping the movie alive with his outrageous role. One must also mention the great soundtrack which creates a perfect atmosphere to the movie and the beautiful sets created in the film, also the neat special effects which add more life to the movie. All in all one the best movies i have ever seen. A true Masterpiece worth seeing more than once."
4,"Truly Memorable Screen Adaptation of Shakespeare's First and Bloodiest Tragedy:,","Made by a very talented director, ""Titus"" is a stylish, visually stunning, energetic and truly memorable adaptation of the bloodiest parade of horrors which the first tragedy of the young Shakespeare is. More of the horror show than powerful and poetic later Bard's tragedies, ""Titus Andronicus"" offers betrayal, murders, tortures, rape, and cannibalism for which Julie Taymor's vision was just perfect in transferring this blood fest to the screen. If it is not enough, the movie has one of the greatest performances in Shakespeare's tragedies I've seen and it is Harry J. Lennix as Aaron. Never have I seen an actor who was able to combine both, noble Othello and the embodiment of evil, Iago in one character so convincingly with such power. Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, and Colin Feore all give terrific performances."
2,Titus - a strange movie,I purchased this expecting something close to an Alexander or some other era movie. It is a modern representation of a Roman time with cars and protests. Its almost a 70's rendition of the Titus character. Its not for eveyone.
2,I'll Take My Shaksespeare Straight,"If you admire Shakespearean plays AS THEY WERE WRITTEN, then don't watch this film. The neo-classical approach of mixing modern day conveniences with antiquity just doesn't work, at least not for me. It's a little unsettling when you see guys shooting pool, people driving caddy's, and soldiers carrying handguns - while at the same time carrying swords and speaking in ye olde english.This movie is very graphic in it's violence and sexual content and should NOT be viewed by young children, incest and cannibalism being among the more disturbing themes that run their course in this film.The acting of course is impeccable, but then again what do you expect from Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. That being said I have to profess my bias for the traditional approach to Shakespeare and would have loved to see them in something a little closer to what the Bard had in mind when he penned his famous prose. Call me close-minded but I'll take my Shakespeare straight."
5,Outstanding work by Taymor,"A year or so ago when I first saw previews for this movie, I knew it looked like something I would want to see. I finally did get to see it a couple days ago and images still linger in my head. There is so much to see in this movie. Everything's well developed and just awesome to watch on any screen. I just loved the dark humore and the acting! The acting's the best part about this movie. If this looks like your type of movie or you're even remotly interested in it go see it now!"
5,A Most Medieval Movie,"SPECTACULAR! Very colorful, in depth, and entertaining flick. This will totally get you involved as this film was not made like many others. Great story as well as a great ending. I will not get into details as you have got to experience TITUS yourself. Highly recommended to add this to your DVD collection."
2,DISGUSTING!!!!!,"THis movie was disgusting!! If you don't have a strong stomach I would advise you to stay away from this movie. Plus, if you don't understand Shakespeare too much you might get lost in the story. THe acting and the directing was good, but I didn't think the movie was good. There were too many questions in my mind at the end of the movie. If you don't know the story, than figure out the story before you watch this. I'm still creeped out by how real this movie seemed."
1,I wish I hadn't seen it,"When I first saw this film I left the theatre weeping uncontrollably. I can't deny the artistic excellence that went into the production, but I rate it with one star because I didn't like this film. It tore out my heart. It is a film about cruelty and lack of mercy. (I suppose the blame for this must go to Shakespeare, who wrote it.) The small ray of hope shown at the end of the film is too small and comes too late to redeem the movie from the dark, miserable images which overwhelm it. I can't forget this movie, but I would like to, because when I think of it I want to cry again. Inhumanity brings only misery. Perhaps that is the point. Mankind would do well to spend more time considering the power of kindness, forgivenss and love."
1,YIKES,"Well I love anthony, but the movie blew big chunks. now I know why this movie quietly appeared and disappeared from the big screen. Rent it if you must, owning it is a bad idea"
5,Julie Taymor is one to watch...,"When I heard Titus was directed by the same person who directed Lion King for Broadway, I was a little apprehensive. What kind of credentials does a person get from directing a kid's musical? Certainly not the kind needed to direct one of Shakespeare's darkest plays...so I thought. Then I saw a special on Julie Taymore (egg or something like that on PBS at about 2 a.m...) I couldn't have been more wrong. She was perfect. Visually, Titus is one of the most impressive movies I have EVER seen, and I have seen a lot of movies. The costumes, the colors--everything--is without equal. Anthony Hopkins is disturbingly good, as is the evil Jessica Lange. If you are a fan of Shakespeare, you need to own this movie. Now."
5,TITUS REBORN,"Julie Taymor did justice to this excellent play. Watch this film with a open mind, before looking for the opinion of scholars on the play (Harold Bloom is the worst)."
3,Why not make it as it was written?,"Why does ever director who gets a work of Shakespeare in his or her hands feel the need to butcher it with this senseless ""artsy-fartsy"" crap? This film would have been much better had it remained true to form and been consistant throughout with one era of history. To go from horsedrawn carriages to motorcycles to cars to machineguns back to swordsmen on horseback is frankly very confusing. The Goth brothers playing video games and smoking cigarettes in a pool hall? It really draws ones attention from the story. An often compelling, often disappointing, less than adequate retelling of one of Shakespeares great tragedies."
1,ANTHONY HOPKINS IS BRILLIANT.,"The movie is not. Just say you DON'T want your mtv. The costumes were terrible, PEE WEE HERMAN(i mean saturnine) was terrible. Jessica Lange-who has'nt had a hit since FRANCES, was godawful in her makeup and acting. Julie Taymor turned this movie into a jazz-swing, webster hall kid,nazi like outfit wearing ,cars and guns, bad music video.Does she do music videos? Anthony Hopkins in between quoting brilliant shakespear as only he can, redeems this entire movie, with his acting and his final revenge.Maybe he wanted out of this movie mess?Violence? the violence was tame, kids. So get off it, already.Watch this movie if you're interested, with alot of time to kill,and don't say i did not warn you on this new 1990's Rome...Romeo and juliet was a little better..but not by much. SCORE FOR ANTHONY HOPKINS! THE ONLY SAVIOR IN THIS STUPID MTV MESS.."
1,"A boring, pompous mess","I'm not going to go into a long explanation of the film here, since many other reviewers have already done so. I will simply say that this movie was a major disappointment. I'm a great fan of serious film, but this movie was a classic example of overzealous direction and production. The arrogant Julie Taymor is obviously trying to ""teach"" us things with this mess, but instead has produced a haphazard melange that is neither entertaining nor particularly attractive. It's just boring. And it's insulting, too, because you get the feeling that Taymor feels it is somehow beneath her to simply create entertainment. Instead she's trying to produce ""art,"" and the heavy-handed results are embarressing to watch. Jessica Lange and Anthony Hopkins try gamely to breathe life into this flaccid film, but even their enormous talents can't raise the dead."
3,Just what i wanted,"I bought this Yuna as a gift and it arrived shortly after. I ordered two different plush but they arrived with their tags switched,bootleg? Perhaps, but they look good enough, and for the price I paid? I won't complain."
4,A Passion for Teaching,"I am a Macon State College student majoring in education and I read A Passion for Teaching for a class. I really enjoyed this book because I felt as though I was able to peek into the lives of different teachers. It was like I was reading their personal journals on why they teach and how they are able to stay passionate about the profession. I also enjoyed this book because it was easy to read. I found this book useful because it proved that after spending several years in the classroom, teachers can remain excited and passionate about teaching. The one thing I didn't like, however, was that there were no articles from a middle or high school math teacher's point of view."
2,"Not sure why this is considered ""SOFT"" by other reviews","Bought this after reading the rave review, so excited to receive this, told my wife we can sleep without fighting for blankets cause I got this super duper fancy soft wool blanket. Even took off work so I can get home early to try this.The result - returned back to Amazon. Fortunately for me Amazon makes returns ultra easy. Now for the comments on the blanket:1. Soft - no way, this is very stiff, and extremly rough, like a soft sandpaper.2. Itchy - try sleeping in shorts or short sleeves, the fabric will make you itch because of the sandpaper like feel.3. warmth - yes, this is true, it does keep you warm. But, my $20 korean blanket keeps me plenty warm as well.4. price - For $160, really expected to beat my $20 korean blanket in warmth & soft & comfort, unfortunately it beats in 0 catagory.Solution - Get another korean blanket for $20. No more fighting for blanket with wife."
3,Good video...could use a better description in crash,I used this video for a project/report in college. Worked well. The acting is poor in some areas especially the crash with people bouncing up and down screaming like mad... I guess I am not very sympathetic being a pilot but mostly screaming will not help other than making everyone else be very nervous and make it the situation worse. On second note it would have been useful if it actually showed more of the outside descent and research for the last half of the film. Ex. like how the airplane hit using a simulation model or something of the sort with computer graphics. Other than that it shows relatively a crash that happened and how bad the aftermath of it can be with burns and body parts.
2,Aptly titled CD,"The title of this CD says it all: Irish Karaoke. Its Irish alright. Make no mistake. Its the first time I've come across karaoke tracks where, at several points throughout the songs, the ""guide"" vocals come in for a line or two, comletely unexpectedly. This may be fine in certain settings....e.g. if a whole gang of people are already singing along, who is going to notice...but if one person is giving a solo rendition, this sudden vocal intrusion can be very disconcerting. It also makes recording a vocal performance impossible, as the guide vocal cannot be removed. Now, is that Irish enough for you?"
1,Disappointing,"The sad part is that the arrangements on some of these are very pretty. However, for some reason they fixed so that you couldn't remove the guide vocals. They come in at the beginning of each new verse, bridge and chorus, then go away. But you can't get rid of them if you want to solo on these songs. Nice selection of songs, nice arrangement on some of them. But useless to a singer."
2,Boring book,"This book has a few interesting quotes in it, but most are dull and well-known. Nothing really fresh or new in this book. I prefer a book of Eastern wisdom titled ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" by Taro Gold, which is much better. But, that's just my opinion!"
3,The Queen is coming to St. Chris,"Miss Maude's old friend, the Queen of Denmark is coming to St. Chris for a visit and the island is in a tizzy. It hasn't been so Danish since their independence in the early part of the 20th century. Miss Maude has planned a special dinner for her Queen and invites her friends for a taste testing party. Everyone ends up ill, much to the horror of Miss Maude. Then her old friend Miss Lucinda dies suddenly, as does the doctor who does her autopsy. Who is behind this, and is the security for the royal visit in jeopardy?This was a quick and enjoyable read, full of decriptions of life on a tropical island. The mystery was very easy to solve, but the story worth reading."
4,"The study of nature, human and non-human, becoming one","Mr. Prosek's book should lend itself as an inspiration to all of us in the outdoor world. I was lucky enough to have a loving father who showed me the ropes of the outdoors, but if I didn't, I would want Joe Haines. Take it as a message to teach your children someday the majesty of the outdoors."
5,Simply wonderful,"A fishing guide friend lent us Joe & Me, which I just finished reading on a cold, rainy March afternoon, lying on the couch with a fire in the fireplace. A perfect way to spend the day, although you'll do equally well under a tree or on a park bench this summer. The simplicity of James' writing evokes ""My Old Man and the Sea"", to my mind one of Hemingway's best. Prosek's watercolors that illustrate the text are a joy as well, and I am ordering the hardcover to keep by the aforementioned couch. A must for anyone who enjoys a respite from the stress of our modern day lives. I can't wait to read more of Prosek's work."
1,NOT TRUE SIZE - AVOID,"This filter measures about 1/2"" smaller on each side than what is advertised.This in effect causes the filter to NOT create an air-tight seal and can slide around in the housing.DO NOT BUY - not having the true sizes loses effectiveness."
5,Thumbs Up!,"As with many of my good teaching ideas, I stole this one from a fellow teacher. This book is great and I would definately recommend it for kindergarten and first grade teachers. It can be used for independent work. It provides sight word practice and also incorporates complete sentence writing. I give it a definate thumbs up!"
3,Learning Sight Words,Great beginner activities for learning site words. I use this book with my students and my son. They enjoy the quickness of the activities.
2,okay for Kindergarten,"Since it was labeled K-2 I thought it might have more advanced words for my 6 year old. He already new all 100. Would be okay for beginners, but does not get very advanced. Good to learn a word a day, but if your kid already has been reading, this book is not advanced enough."
4,I really liked this book,I really enjoyed using this book in my kindergarten classroom during the second half of the school year as my students advanced in their reading skills. I found it to be an excellent additional learning tool to my teaching of sight words. I liked this helpful book.
2,Sight Word Practice pages,I am a bit disappointed with this.For the price I would have expected a CD rom to download the pages
4,OLD SCHOOL,"If you like Denzel and remember him in his early days, you'll love and respect this movie."
3,STIFF BUT EFFECTIVE,"This tv movie is hopelessly preachy and manipulative, but it does bring to the front the tragic issue of drunk driving. A talented and lively high school senior is killed by a drunk driver; her family tries to deal with the guilt and the father is determined to bring the driver to justice. The script is cliched, but it does try to look at both sides of the coin and focus on the alcoholic issue as well as vehicular manslaughter. Denzel Washington makes one of his earlier appearances as the prosecuting attorney but the writers don't give him much to do. James Farentino and Penny Fuller, along with Don Murray and Millie Perkins, do an okay job in showing the anguish of the victim and the perpetrator. Not a classic but not a dud either."
2,False advertisement,"The producers of this movie are geniuses. This movie is skillfully marketed as if Denzel is the lead actor when in fact he is only in the last half of the film (more like the last half hour of the film). I only bought it because I love Denzel. By the time he made it to the screen, I was already sleep. This movie is quite horrid. The story line drags, the actors are boring and the outcome is fairly predictable. The only satisfaction I received from the film is that he played a lawyer."
1,Quite possibly the WORST movie I have ever seen...,"This movie is so bad that it is almost campy. The writing is beyond formulaic-- it's so awful that it's almost funny. The characters are so flawed that they are almost cartoonish. The camera work is so ridiculously amateur that it brings to mind the awful products of high school film classes-- in the 70s. It is so predictable in its plodding that the most interesting thing about it is the outdated hairstyles and fashions embraced by its cast members. The white-centered stereotyping in this movie is shockingly racist, and the characters are completely unbelievable. Even Denzel Washington cannot save this film in possibly his worst film role ever.This film is part anti-drunk-driving docusaga, part movie of the week, and part low-budget white nuclear family period piece. Perhaps the only redeeming virtue it has is the possibility that it will one day become a cult film with people lip-synching the awful lines and camping it up a la Rocky Horror."
1,License to Kill,"Laurie S. really said it all...that review is SPOT ON!The moment you fire up the DVD and see the fuzzy 1970's type film quality and schmaltzy music, you go ""Uh Oh!""Unless your dad is a drunk that you're trying to rehabilitate, I would leave this one on the rack."
2,Public Service,"This film seemed to be a public announcement regarding drunk driving. It takes you through the events of the accident to the verdict of the trial. Between this it presents the heartship both families suffer. Though it was slightly entertaining, it was not worthy of purchase."
3,The only BMW 6 series book worrth buying.,This book is the most up to date one on the market. The only problem is that it tends to focus on alot of the european models. The BMW Buyers Guide from Fred Larimer is more useful on US models.
1,almost worthless!,"This book would serve as a decent coaster, or door stop, but that is where its usefullness ends. It is clear that the ""author"" was given a task, and he labored to fill pages. The book starts with discussions of many other models, and when it finally does get to the BMW e24 it throws some random facts together to finish the book. Save your money, don't buy it"
1,Dissapionted!,"I hate buying a book about a car I like and then finding out it's all BLACK and WHITE! Tries to stretch out the book by starting off with history of BMW, not what I wanted, I wanted only the 6 and great pictures. Too many wasted pages about other things. If I saw the book at the store I would not have bought it."
2,Amateurish drivel,"Having worked on a number of 6-Series cars, I can confidently say that this book is average at best, toilet paper at worst.The 'journalist's' ego is positively bursting from the pages of this book and it really is a painfully dull read. Lack of expertise can be covered by an entertaining style, if you have neither then I would imagine you are in real trouble.Gerhard Berger's name on the cover is bound to sell some copies, but I would imagine his involvement with the project ended when he agreed his royalty price.The only use for this book is to weigh down some paper or reach a higher shelf in the store. A poor effort..."
2,"Passable, but not great.","While a useful reference, this book is not as complete as I'd like. It's much too terse, and like most Chilton books uses the words ""Assembly is the reverse of removal"" a bit too often. The photographs are good but sometimes don't provide enough of a view to allow you to orient yourself -- which is especially important, given the restricted access to the engine in these vans.Additionally, large amounts of space are taken up by boilerplate information such as tips on jacking that is not edited to be specifically relevent to Ford vans.Maybe I was spoiled by the excellent service manual I had for my previous van (a 1975 VW), but altogether I was hoping for more from this book."
2,It's ok,"I buy this product thinking my daughter would be better taking care but it was not sufficiently humid there were kind of dry so I have to use more than one, and the package look like it have more but notDidn't like this product"
5,Works for me,"I carry this product with me when I travel within the states, to the beach and when I travel internationally.It seems to keep the mosquitoes away."
2,High Price for Little Functionality,"For the price of this flash, I would consider alternatives such as a Sunpak PZ5000 which offer many advanced features for a smaller price tag. Also the batteries that this unit requires tend to be costly versus commonly used AA cells. The ""pro"" flash, SB80DX is a great product but more than double the price of the PZ5000! I wish Nikon would keep up with its competitors in the amateur photographer market."
3,Not Very Compatible,"This flash works great with my Nikon film SLR, but it doesn't work with my new Nikon D70. Get something that is going to be more compatible."
4,What kind of Love is This,Musser states her viewpoints well. Her book made me feel that I was not alone. I'm glad it was available at the time I most needed it.
5,WOW!,"This book really took me by suprise! I got it from the library and didn't think it would be much... but I was totally blown away by all the facts and special features that are all crammed into this great effort! It's got at least 5 pages on each of the 23 movies and has special interviews with people like Hauro Naijama (who played Godzilla) and Robert Dunham (who played the leader of Seatopia in ""Godzilla vs. Megalon""). It also does a good job slamming the new Godzilla film and also slamming some of the bad Godzilla movies of the early 70's. It tells all the cost cutting measures that Toho took to make thier films cheaper to produce... you know what I'm talking about.... stock footage! Alot of little known facts about this great monster that graced the silver screen. There are not many pictures, but it is so interesting that there are no need for alot of photos. Great book... I really recommend this great book to any classic Godzilla fan!"
5,Explores all aspects of medicine's new challenges,Rick Carlson and Gary Stimeling's Terrible Gift provides an eye-opening inspection of genetic medicine's ethical and moral implications. The physician's role has changed from a curer to an enhancer: this explores all aspects of medicine's new challenges.
1,Bad Science and Exaggerated Claims make this book useless,"First, much of this book deals with issues in the delivery of healthcare, not genetics. Second, while genetic engineering poses serious risks that must be managed by our government, the authors have proposed one of the most ludicrous ones in their chapter ""Silent Bombs"" discusion of Monsanto's ""Terminator"" gene. They write ""It renders crop plants sterile, thus enclosed, monopolized, and growable only from patented one year seed...If the gene spread into the wild, it could sterilize other species and possibly drive them to extinction."" (p. 190-191) I'm embarrased to be caught with this book! I guess the authors never heard the joke ""If your parents were sterile, does that mean you also cannot have children?"" Need I say more about these authors."
1,"wrong, wrong, wrong","This book is a disservice to research and writing. The information is wrong. The writing is unsufferable. The message is lost in incorrect information, bad research work, and poor writing. This is a waste of money."
1,unfounded research /boring,"Picked up this book at a conference. Fortunately I did not have to purchase it. The book has unfounded reasearch, outdated material and is boring."
2,Just okay,"There are a few books popping up on this subject and I found this one disappointing. The best photograph appears on the cover but the wineries included inside lean to the more traditional. If you are looking for a coffee-table book, I would suggest Wine By Design which has more extensive photographs, site plans, and drawings."
5,With striking full-color illustrations,"Mardi Gras Treasures charts the specialty parade floats of Carnival in New Orleans from 1870-1930, examining classic and artistic themes and recreating original float designs in watercolor and lithographs. The author, Henri Schindler, has himself designed Mardi Gras parades and balls for some time: his striking full-color illustrations will appeal to a wide audience, from float designers to artists with a special interest in New Orleans works and history."
4,Freaky antiquey notecards,"First of all, I like notecards that stand out abit. These definately are eye catchy and NOT supercolorful, giving off that vibe of yesteryear. When I saw the cards I thought,""damn, Id like to write a few letters using those!"" I'm pleased w purchase! Happy Early Mardi Gras!"
5,A great Book for Beginners,"The Good Reference Book for Beginners, filled with lots of illustrations and concise information that suitable for anyone. As for Amatuer and Professional Bowlers, I will strongly recommend the sequence of this book ""Bowling: Knowledge is the Key"" also by Fred Borden which cater for the Advanced Bowlers.In the book ""Bowling : 10 Keys to Success"", 10 Keys to Success includes the following: 1) Bowling Safety 2) Stance Position 3) Approach 4) Armswing 5) Release 6) Finish Position 7) Making Spares 8) Adjusting to Lanes 9) Bowling Balls 10) The Mental Game."
4,Worth it if you get a good price.,"For those interested in the topic, this has got all the basics. Note that the focus it on the publishing end of things. Not a bad little reference, so if you can get it cheap, go for it."
4,Great sounds but.......,"Son Volt is absolutely one of my favorite bands. Jay's songwriting is exceptional and his voice is unique and conveys powerful emotions. The sound on this DVD is great, no complaints there but...having never seen Son Volt in concert I didn't know Jay keeps his eyes closed 95% of the time while he's singing. For me it dampens the enjoyment of this DVD considerably. Visual quality A+, Sound A+, the ""show"" itself C-"
5,Touching Christmas Story,"I love Christmas stories and this one has become one of my favorites. It's a story set in 1918 but the family values of love and giving are still important in this day and time. I was happy to be reading a story of family life back a couple of generations and how events that happened then can still touch us now. We follow the Beal family thru their preparations for Christmas. You will love this family especially the character whom the story revolves around 9 year old Anna who is the owner of ""The Golden Ring"". It's an interesting story with lots of twists and turns. I read it in my spare time in 3 days because I wanted to hear the whole story. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased this case for a HTPC I am building. Several reviews I read made mention of several areas of concern which included missing screws and parts. I dismissed them as being the exception rather than the norm. I was very mistaken.After waiting 2 weeks for the case to arrive, I was disappointed to find that indeed, a case screw was missing (not a big deal, internal fans were missing, and to top it off, the front panel hinge was broken. All this on what was supposed to be a new case!I would strongly recommend choosing another case, as quality control is a foreign term to NZXT.Amazon's customer service was very friendly and very quick to RMA the case and issue me a full refund."
1,Total piece of C--P!!!,"I'm so upset!!! Reading the other reviews from 2006,, why are they still selling this piece of junk! I bought this a week ago,, Santa did that is,, and wasn't happy that we needed to go out and buy a cord for it, why would they not include it! I do not want to take the risk in buying a ac adapter special for it, I will go find a different karoke machine that includes it,, forget this,, we already tried different ac adapters in the house, and only the microphones work,, I'm not wasting another minute,, we were all so excited for this, she had been waiting for this along time,, thanks for spoiling our 3 year olds christmas, you had her crying, thanks alot!!@!!Dang I'm pissed!"
1,Worst Christmas Gift EVER!,"My 6 yr old daughter wanted this for Christmas and it was a HUGE disappointment! It never worked right! I read all the bad reviews but hoped for the best but the reviews were correct - this is an awful product! Luckily, I purchased the warranty and got all my $$ back!!!"
2,Okay at first but....,"My daughter loved this for the first two times we used it. The lights, microphones, and CD player worked fine. And then we tried to use it for the third time only to find out that it wasn't working at all. Only the lights worked. It wouldn't play or even acknowledge the presence of a CD. And like all others who have rated this product, it was disappointing to recognize that there was no AC adapter. Instead, it took 6 ""C"" batteries! Big disappointment."
2,Not worth the cost.,"This item is nice to look at - quality of microphones is terrible - loud screeching. Also uses batteries very fast. The booklet that came with it says to order an AC Adapter, use the enclosed accessories order form but no order form was enclosed. When I contacted the supplier, they said that they do not supply the adapter and I should try Radio Shack. Very disappointed in their response."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is the cutest piece of junk ever created. The ""karaoke"" function was poor at first and soon nonexistant. We used it as a boom box for awhile, but the sound wasn't great, and it ate batteries (you have to buy an adapter separately). It didn't help that the kids had a tendency to leave it on, and there's no handy ""on"" light to indicate this to parents (all the controls are awkward at best). It finally died, and my kids were sad to see it go, based solely on how cute it is -- I had to sneak it out of the house. They received this for Christmas from a distant relative, so returning it wasn't really an option."
2,Defective product....,"Apart from the money part, imagine the dis-appointment happening to the kids if the product doesn't work at the first sight....?? Ok, moreover when tried to return it, there is no acknowledgement nor any response back regarding the refund. Why is it being sold again, if the product is defective?? Please stop selling the product and take a closer look at the product review before selling it again, it is really annoying when things like this happens. Please rectify. It is also disapointing when we cannot talk to a customer service personnel over the phone."
1,Bought two and both stopped working!!!,"This is such a cute toy and my daughter was having a great time with it a couple of days and then the cd player just stopped reading the cd. Took it back and the same thing happen! I can't believe they allow this thing to stay on the shelves!I'm going to go with the Spongebob Karaoke which is made by Emerson, at least a brand I've heard of."
1,Christmas Disappointment,My 4 year old daughter was so excited to get this from her grandma and grandpa for Christmas--the cd player never worked only the disco lights. Thankfully she had enough other stuff to keep her busy. Grandma felt awful. Toys'R'Us needs to pull this until it can guarentee a working product.
1,Never worked,Santa got this for our girls and we never got to use it. Did not work with batteries nor an adapter that we had to purchase. It is very cute and we love the fact it had 2 mikes. The same thing also happened to my friend who also purchased it.
2,Bollywood-mistake!,"As a fan of a lot of Bollywood movies this was a major disappointment. 3-girls go to India in hopes of becoming actresses in Bollywood films. They do not know where they are going,or where exactly to go to meet the guy-that 1 of the girls-supposedly was supposed to meet to be in his film. When they arrive to meet the guy-he is no-where to be found. Then after a few days he contacts where they are and sends word to come to another place-to audition. When they arrive they are late -do not know how to dance and it just gets more and more disappointing. I watched it because it had 5-stars. But -it did not deserve-so many. At best it gets 2-by me."
3,hey!,"None of the real Death-Fans likes Eva O? -Sorry, me too. But after all I say: This album is O.K. ..."
5,"there is no sound or meaning, the world is dead!","i enjoyed this cd quite a bit. it isnt great compared to the almighty Only Theatre of Pain, but it is compared to alot of other cds by alot of other bands, especially MTV garbage like boy bands and limpdick.The singing definitely has a passionate quality to it, and the instrumantal playing is done at a very masterful quality.i liked all the songs. there is something in Rozz's music that should satisfy a great variety of people. i wish more people knew of the great work he did when he was alive. RIP Rozz 1964-1998"
3,Definitely not the best...,"Though this release almost sounds good, many of the songs falter halfway through (Like ""Sex""(the song, not the act itself!!)). Lost Minds is ""jammin'"", but the band sounds tired and old in most of the songs. Well, there is always the Path of Sorrows!"
5,Cree loves otters.,My son Cree collects otters.I didn't know that there was a hockey team of Missouri River Otters until I ran across it at Amazon.com.You rock!
5,routines and more routines,"If you ever had to program a complicated numerical algorithm, such as SVD decomposition, Bessel functions, eigensystems or Fourier transform, you will know how useful this book is. All those problems, and many others, are presented, the theory is explained and the full code of a routine, which solves it, is given. This version brings the codes in Pascal, but there are versions for FORTRAN, C++ and Basic. If you need any routine, you just have to ""cut and paste"" it from the book into your program."
2,Calcium capsules,I am disappointed in this vendor. I like the product but a good portion of the capsules were empty. The calcium was at the bottom of the bottle.
1,Not what ordered,Ordered chewable sent capsules and can not take they are to big I chocked.Will not order again.They would not exchange item I tossed them in the trash.
4,good book for ages 5-10,"I am a pre-k Sunday school teacher and bought this book to use for them because it is mixed in with all other preschool books. It is a fine book, but most-all of the activities are too advanced for them. It says on the cover for ages 5-10, but I couldn't read that in the picture. Just a heads up."
3,Rats dvd,Received quickly was as said it would be. Happy with purchase. It was a DVD that one of my boys ordered they liked it very much Not much else to say it was a movie.
2,WORTH $...,"This album does exactly what is say's. It chill's listeners out.The phrase 'Chillout' is a 'cop-out' because the ingrediants to a successful chillout album are as follows--nothing fast or exicting-music that sends you into a trance, i.e- dull, uninspiring, unemotional music that the listener falls asleep to-nothing challengingThere where about 7 good songs on this whole album out of 37. They where Royksopp, Zero 7, Badly Drawn Boy, Radiohead (whats this doing on a trance album), Bent, Faithless and IIO. The problem for me was that i had many of these songs already.Buy if you want to fall asleep, if you own a restaurant or if you've got more money than sense.I however recommend Bent, Zero7 and Faithless (2 most recent) as great dance albums."
1,Bad Phone,The base is to light. Answer phone and base slides with reciver. The phone is complicated to program and i got so frustated with it. I donated it to a charity.
3,There are better dvds out there,"Probably only watch this one once, there are better dvds out there, some good points, but id certainly look else where. Les Brown or speakers like him..."
4,Lovely resource for Virginia history,"The book's title is a quote from Thomas Jefferson, ""Theheight of our mountains has not yet been estimated . . ."".Jefferson's essay is among the 70 reprinted here, from1612 to 1948. This historical material is fun to readand is a great resource for children and others studyingVirginia's history and geography."
5,Virginia Writing,A beautiful collection of writings about Virginia. A terrific read. There is something for everyone in this book.
4,Remastered; tough to find,"This was a limited release box with like a 50-page booklet etc. of this incredibly-influential act who during this time had the goal of giving a concert with no people on stage, just machines! {not exactly in line with your standard, say, punk mentality] These releases represent their best period, where their geekiness was informed by a little worldliness. The hook of this box is that these are remastered and affectionately packaged. I remember the vinyl at that time had phenomenal kick; the regular CDs don't seem to. Ciao."
2,"Man Machine, Trans-Europe Express and Radio Activity","This boxset contains the 3 albums from 1975 through 1978 that Kraftwerk recorded for Capital. Each album is on a different CD, but they are all in one double wide jewel case. Include is a 40 page booklet and a poster. The whole comes in a cardboard sleeve. The sound quality is mediocre.I am not a big fan of their music from this period. It is too much heavy German electronica. To me, it is mostly noise. It does not have the medolic flow of Autobahn. I ripped the songs I liked off of the CDs and came up with about 50 minutes of music (about 40%).It was rare when it was released and now it is out of print. Right now, as I right this, someone is selling it on Amazon for $300. I wonder what I could get for mine."
3,Did not come with DVD,"I was hoping that it would still have the DVD, but no. I did not find that it was really helpful without the DVD and it was packaged poorly. The packaging paper was partially torn. The book is in fair condition, though."
4,A Must for new Users,I am new to FCE. This boook clearly explained how to use the application and answers questions you have when you get stuck.
2,Save your money,"Except for the little chat (on the DVD included) about how FCE differs from iMovie, there is not much quality in this book. The video footage included is awful. There are many typos, and the index is VERY poor. (Look up ""Sequence."") This book was so bad, I purchased another title -- ""Final Cut Expess Solutions"" by Jason and David Teague to learn FCE. It's a much better book. I wish someone like Wolsky and/or the Teagues would make a good video about using FCE -- similar to the tutorial that came with my copy of FCE."
1,"Poor, Poor Book on FCE2... Don't waste your money","Ok, I admit.... this book looked really cool at first glance (the chapter on the Brady Bunch theme showed promise), but when I actually got into the book, it was hard to follow, and I felt the author's bias shadowed over the book. He continually made reference to things he wished they had in the software that weren't there and other opinionated things like that. I really wanted to like this book because of the little movie talking about the differences between iMovie and FCE2. That was about the only thing that was valuable in this entire book. The video footage was unbearable. I wish it could have been better!"
2,Not worth it,"I bought this book on the basis of the positive reviews, and boy, do I regret it. This was very little help and is written in a schizophrenic, haphazard form that is maddening. Example: right after he has you load up the first lesson, he goes off on long explanations of functions that he then says will be used in later chapters, not that one. Then he gets back to the lesson - supposedly - and goes off explaining other controls. Finally, the chapter ends and YOU'VE NEVER EVEN USED THE LESSON! He tells you to close it up and start importing your own material.And, as stated before, there are many typos, or worse, errors like telling you to use the button on the right when he really means to say left, so it's confusing and frustrating. I used to tutor English at university level and if this had come across my desk I would have considered it a rough draft. Even from a pure logic standpoint, it's a jumble. If you're a beginner to Final Cut Express, stay away from this one!"
3,Helpful but dated,This book is really dated and the illustrations are a bit confusing. This helped answer a couple questions I had but overall I was not as impressed as I had hoped to be.
5,How are these guys not signed?,"These guys rock! With a great blend of catchy rock riffs combined with lyrics that will have you singing along after one listen, this is a great album. My wife and I used the song My Angel in our wedding. Tripper has a great range and all of the songs are radio-worthy. Do your self a favor and check these guys out!"
5,This is Indie rock??,"I heard about these guys through a friend in Detroit, but after getting their stuff, I was hooked. The songs are as good as anything on rock radio these days. They're one of the few bands not trying to capitalize on the hot trends in music, instead, they're churning out solid, melodic rock - they know where they fit and they do it well. As far as the songs go, ""the Good Guy"" captures completely that feeling all guys get when they're crazy about someone who's going out with a total jackass. From edgy, punchy stuff like ""holiday"", ""Barefoot"" and ""Clearly Mistaken"" - to the country-tinged ""One summertime"" - these guys do it all. If more people had this CD, they'd be all over the airwaves. Buy it."
5,Excellent Book for Medical Claims Examiners or New Graduates,GREAT Book!! This Speak louder than words!!
1,Raw Data,"Essentially a regurgitation of offical sources and regimental histories with some slick graphics. Poorly written, choppy and in places incoherent. Do not waste your money."
4,cliff,"This is the first studio recording by Cliff. It is actually almost a live album. On the day of the recording at EMI studio's, there were so many fans outside, they just let them sit in and watch. This was the closest to Elvis the British had. there are many cover songs here that American's all know, but there are a lot of originial songs most of the US have never heard. If you love early Rock 'n' Roll music with a lot of passion this is for you. Some of the time the girls screaming get so loud it almost drowns out Cliff! But that's a sign of the excitement the British had to this new music. Remember this was recorded in 1959."
5,Pleasently great!!!!!!!!!,"Toco is a great guitarist with a beautiful tone of voice that makes that perfect Brazilian combo (something like what Joao Gilberto started sounding 50 years ago) blending Jazz with Samba and MPB.This is a great debut CD by him, and a greatly pleasent one; those albums you can listen to from beginning to end w/out skipping songs.If you enjoy people like Celso Fonseca or Vinicius Cantuaria or Affonsinho; you will definitely love Toco."
2,Lied to!,"This item was supposed to be new when I bought it but it was undeniably used. I was upset by this because I was planning on using this book for a long time, not something that is a one time use. Just know that if you buy a book from here, it might not be new!"
2,Ineffective and Wordy,"Shapo covers all the technical elements of writing a legal memo and brief, and offers appendices with helpful samples of each. The intro/first chapter gives a very nice introduction to the structure of the US Court system, which I found very helpful as a first-year (1L) law student.But it's all downhill from there. Shapo tries to describe how to construct the different parts of legal memos and briefs, but the given examples are sparse and often imperfect.This book would be much more effective if it spent less time describing how to write a good document and more time showing examples of well-written briefs and memos."
4,Required text,"Decent book, fairly basic but gets all the points across. Not confusing like case books. Typical LARC"
5,Excellent Health Book Resource,"I follow the recommendations and I can feel the difference over a period of time. I am very impressed with the book and like the spiral binding. It's a top 3 ""should have in your library"" health book. I'm very grateful for their efforts. It's helped my life tremdously and I highly recommend ""Prescription for Nutrional Healing"" as it's companion. Thank You Soooo Much.."
5,all around good choice,"I use this lens on my D70 DSLR, I haven't used it with film.This lens is great for wilderness-hiking or touristing/walking around the city. While the pictures are not as good as a dedicated lens, this jack of all trades almost never leaves my camera for day to day shots.The 105mm (~150 on dslr) has allowed me to take great shots that are normally out of reach such as statues around town and animals in the distance.The 28mm (~45) is wide enough for a nice landscape shot.The Macro feature is great for insects or jewelery.If you're just walking around, ready to take a picture of anything that comes up then this lens is a great choice.I never use a flash and my low light pictures have turned out great despite the small aperture...so long as it's not a picture of a moving target (i.e. cat or child)."
4,Solid 4 Star Lens,"I own lenses costing several times this lens from the 14-24mm F2.8 to the 70-200mm f/2.8 VR but find myself reaching for this more and more often due to its versatility.The lens is light and the focal range is perfect for general tourism photography during the day and night if you use a flash or tripod. I use it on the D700 and it gets sharp shots for much of what I shoot.My favorite thing about the lens is the Macro mode which works well enough to get shots of flowers, insects and other creepy crawlies as you can put the lens within an inch or so from the subject to get satisfying results.While this lens isn't going to be ""better"" than some of Nikon's newer and more expensive models for specific situations I would highly recommend this lens for anyone looking for convenience and those who don't have to have the ""perfect"" shot every time."
2,slow and has flare,"It is very slow and has flare, particularly when using flash. I sacrifice the zomm and use 35-70 f2.8 instead."
2,Not sharp - stay away,"I bought Nikon N75 with this lense for my dad a few years back. But it has been a totally diappointing experience as the lense is not sharp at all(I have used Minolta and other SLRs) I feel, the conventional 28-80mm zoom would have been a wiser choice. But I had decent expectations about Nikon which I regret now!"
4,Don't Get Fooled - by misleading reviews,"Sorry Anders, all the known tracks from 11/06/64 Breman, Germany are here. The missing tracks he alludes to, are outakes from Howin' Wolf London Sessions - now avaiable on the Deluxe Edition.On this cd the wonderful tracks are: Forty-Four, All My Life & Dust My Broom!-Steve"
1,Thank you Mr. Howlin Wolf,"Mr. Howlin Wolf gave it all to Germany and then some. I know it just by listening to the samples, I dont even own this yet. Good lord God allmighty it dont get any better then this right here."
3,Not for the student,"If this is your first Chinese book, it's kind of fun, but it doesn't take you very far. If you really want to learn Chinese, there are a lot better books than this. This is more of a stocking stuffer/[bathroom] book."
5,"Intelligently written, fun to read","This book introduces and organizes Chinese characters in a useful and fun manner. It explains things in a way that logically fits many pieces together, and therefore makes them easier to remember. It's a heck of a lot more than just a list of characters."
4,Old Rock a Billy,"If you are a fan of the blues or rock-a-billy, Elvis or Carl Perkins, then you will enjoy this two CD set. You get over 30 songs for a few bucks, so it's a good deal. There are a few classics that anyone would like and the rest are for those who appreciate the sounds.Enjoy."
3,smallish field of view,"it does provide a well lit view, but it is very narrow. I Have other units that operate better. This is a russian made product. the ""super charged"" infrared booster does not add anything to the image quality."
5,A unique blend of Black Metal,"I have long been a Metal fan, although I'm relitively new to the Black Metal genre, but on a whim I picked this CD up and couldn't stop listening. While fans of more traditional Black Metal may not approve of Chapter III, the albulm is fabulous for someone devolping a taste for extreme metal. This albulm has elements of many other genres, particularly, the melodic/goth/death elements that are present throughout. I'd have to say that ""The ending of our yesterday"" is my favorite track on this release with ""An Angel's Funeral"" and ""Sacred Divinity"" close behind. So definitely pick this one up."
2,Generic Death Metal,I can't say I am too fond of this release. Straigh forward Death metal with perhaps a hint of atmosphere but not much. There is isn't really a lot to say but I find a lot of harsh metal albums to be much stronger. If you are into this band purchase but if looking for a starter kit for death metal there are way better releases out there.
3,Page-turner/Frightening but far-fetched,"First I have to say it was hard to put this book down. But, by the end of the book there were just too many things that didn't make sense. For example, what kind of summer camp allows a 13 year old girl to get a tattoo and her belly-button pierced without her parents knowledge?!! What caused Rachel's mother, Phyllis to be such a miserable, unhappy person. She and Rachel seem to have no capacity for loving one another. How did that happen? Where/what was their foundation? Just too many people, incidents, etc that seemed wholly unrealistic."
3,Missing answers...,"Family history could be a great novel - the story of a family torn by lies and an accident that could have been terrible. But it is an average novel with a lot of answers missing - why did Kate, the daughter, feel the need to lie about her father? What caused the changes in her personnality? Why did Ned and Rachel, the parents, suddenly ptch things up and become, once more, a ""happy"" family?It also seems that the ending was a little too easy... as if the author needed to end her novel and did not know how.This book is a great companion on the beach, on a sleepless night or the get your minds of things... but do not pick it up if you are in the mood for great litterature."
3,c'est pas mal...,"Although I enjoyed the writing style of the author, I felt a bit let down at the end. The story seems to build toward the dramatic, and then abruptly ends with no finale."
2,Much left unexplained. SPOILERS!!!!!,"I found this book to be a page turner in spite of the fact that it was so poorly layed out and the fact that it makes it look like girls that make accusations of sexual abuse are crazy and making it up. In this story a young and disturbed girl says that her father molested her. In the real world Ned (the father) would have been arrested and child protective services would have gotten involved. The author left all of that out. What happened the night Kate was watching her little brother? What became of the little brother. Was he damaged by his fall? Kate's story was not explored at all, just her bad behavior was described. I kept reading because I kept expecting something to be revealed at the last minute but it wasn't. It would have been a 5 star book to me if the author had just gone some where with the story."
3,"fast, but frustrating","I was enthusiastic about this book initially. The premise sounded intriguing and the writing itself is excellent. But, the story itself didn't work for me. I found the structure frustrating, the constant back and forth cuts between past and present seemed unnecessary and actually lessened the suspense for me rather than enhanced it. But the most irritating thing of all is that nothing is explained or resolved in this book. I kept reading, hoping for a revelation a surprise twist even as to what had happened to Kate. I suspected something must have happened at camp, but there was nothing. No reason for her to have done what she did, and we never find out if she really is crazy or if something happened to her. And why say what she did about her father? I think it was hugely unfair of the author to set all this up, and then never pay it off, to expect the reader to invest time and energy and then have the ending just fade away, with all the loose ends just dangling in the wind."
4,It's sad but still an excellent read.,"This was the first book I read by Dani Shapiro. Depending on my mood I may read Jude Deveraux, Sandra Brown, Lee Child and others. I thought this was a book that everyone would enjoy. The author's writing is so engrossing that you can't wait to read the next page. Overall, this is an excellent read and I would recommend it."
2,yet another one of these.,"the writing here is very good, but the problem is that the story is inherently uninteresting. do we really need another story about a dysfunctional family anchored by a self-indulgent mother?"
2,SAVE YOUR TIME!,I found this book to be a waste of time and very depressing. Just another book where you keep waiting on the big punchline and it never comes!
3,Couldn't get that engaged with this book,"I enjoy some of Dani Shapiro's novels. I had a harder time engaging with this one. I didn't finish it. It might have been timing (when one ""connects"" with a novel)."
2,The end was dissappointing,Slow start for me. The middle of the book was great and I really felt for the characters. I couldn't put it down towards the end and was looking forward to an ending that would just bring it all together and it didn't. This might be the most disappointed I have been in a book.
1,Quick shallow read,A very fast read because it was written like a teen novel. Fortunately it wasted little of my time since it was such an easy read.
3,Very well-written; not too believable,"A page-turner about the disintegration of a family. I never understood what happened to Kate at summer camp that sent her hurtling over the edge. Nor was I clear, at the end, on what had changed to let in a tiny ray of hope. The characters are well-drawn, and the dialogue sounds real. I haven't read other novels by Dani Shapiro but might try another."
4,Great Book!,"You will not be able to put this book down! I highly recommend it. Shapiro is adept at getting inside people's minds. She illustrates well how a mother and father can honestly do their best to raise their children with love and understanding, only to be left feeling helpless when circumstances somewhat beyond their control threaten the very core of their family relationships."
4,"RIVETING, SERIOUS READING!!","This is a serious book which realistically portrays a family dealing with incredibly sad situations. This should be read by a mature audience, as well as by people who think that they may wish to enter into social services. Shapiro deftly writes about how a family could easily disintegrate. She writes with uncanny realism. I don't view this as a ""fast read."" Shapiro offers much info in a rather brief book -- and gets the job done! Very sad reading... it's always sad when children are not well. This is especially true when parents feel [and are] helpless as to how to provide a remedy."
5,MC-20 vs MC-36,"I have owned the MC-20 for over 15 years, and one of the reasons I prefer it over the newer MC-36, is that while the MC-20 can take a pill battery (CR2032), the battery is really not needed; the MC-20 gets its power from the camera if the battery is not installed.The MC-36 (which has basically the same functions as an MC-20) does not require its batteries (2 AAA) for use as a simple shutter release. However, according to the MC-36 manual, without batteries the MC-36 electronics (the display and the beep) and all other functions (eg, timers) are inoperative. With the MC-20, the display and other functions remain active as long as the MC-20 is connected to the camera.I also like the feel of the MC-20 better in my hand."
2,It could of been a Contender!,In the United States there is not much information for the general public about the History of the Orthodox Church. I was hoping for something on the mode of of say John Romers Byzantium. But I was diasappointed by this DVD. Now I am sure that the folks who put forth this effort tried to do their best. But I just hope that some one else comes forth and does a better job. As this could be a really good & interesting story for the armchair historian.
4,What a picture!,"I researched them all and at the time of my purchase this TV had the largest screen that provided the very best picture. I am still amazed at the clarity on the high definition channels. It is almost scary! However, the poor excuse for a sound/speaker system is almost embarrassing! That was remedied with the 600 watt Pioneer entertainment system that I bought with it. Without an addtional sound system, I would have been disappointed. Having written all of this, none of this came as a surprise and that is why I did nor purchase the TV until I have chosen a sound system to complement the fine picture."
5,"Great TV!! Lots of features, and good price!!","This TV is great!Pro:- Excellent pictures- 1080p support!!- 2 HDMI for future upgrade(I don't have HD/Blueray player yet!)- Amazing picture with XBOX 360!!- Extremely clear with PC input!!- Good price!- Free professional delivery from Amazon's shipperCons:- Makes you want to upgrade to HD/Blueray DVD player, because now you can see the limitation of regular DVD!!"
1,Lemon Product,"Lemmon ProductSamsung has been trying to fix a problem for 3 months- White Spot on the screen- They have not been able to solve it. Even though the product is under guarantee, they do not want to replace it. Amazon told me, we can not do anything about it. If you want to by CD and Books, Amazon is ok. If you want to purchase a real Item, go to Best Buy., they can replace it."
1,terrible tv,"DO NOT BUY THIS TV.. after several months, the tv starts turning on and off by itself. Ok, i can deal with that. After 2 years, there are white spots all over the screen. It looks like a constellation all over the screen. I will never buy another samsung product. stay away from it. It is nice at first but soon turns to garbage."
1,A disaster,"The Samsung HL-S6187W is a disaster. Samsung no longer makes DLP tvs because they are nothing but moving parts waiting to break. I started having problems with my tv after about 5000 hours and four years. At an original cost of $3500 + tax, that's close to 900$ per year for this set. The set turns itself off after only a few minutes. Of course the extended warranty I bought is already up. I replaced the lamp, then replaced the lamp ballast. I have troubleshot the temperature sensor & that is also not it. Now the only thing left to do is to pay a technician several hundred dollars to come out to my house in the boonies. No guarantee that they can fix it of my money back. Don't buy a DLP tv!"
2,Samsung HL-S6187W,"Do not recommend to buy. Multiple tech. problems have occured immediately after purchase. They have no way to exchange, just repair for free. We have waited 2 weeks for repair man; has changed something major inside. Problem appreared over 9 months. You cannot adjust a screen to a mode to see a bottom line. Such model provides you to catch just 85% visibility of any movie. Stay away of that model."
3,just one glitch,"Love the size, love the picture....totally easy to set up and run. After three weeks though, a loud fan can be heard behind the set and has required setting up a service call. Samsung's rep seemed to know exactly what I was referring to so it appears to be a recurring thing...will write more after service call in two days."
4,You know you want to know about the shipping,"The TV, all you would expect if you bought it right out of the store.The delivery, very fast, but if you get Fedex, your kinda up the river. I don't think you can choose who delivers it. Anyways, the FedEx guy is like ""Were do you want it"" I said ""in my den"" and he said ""I can't come in your house"". What? So he had to put it in my garage...no problem. What a minute! It's on a wooden palette! I bought the Samsung stand also, so now I have to get rid of a huuuuge box, a palette, the stand box and all the packaging stuff in the world. You people that got the guys that come in set it up and take all the garbage away were very lucky! I was concerned it might be cracked or something. Although, every thing was fine. Must have tv if you have a PS3!"
4,Good Value,"To start, this unit has a great picture. I did a fair amount of research before buying this unit and it didn't disappoint. I do have a few small quibbles such as the way using an external sound system is handled. When you use an external sound system the tv's audio functions are disabled and all controls such as volume and muting must be handled through your external system. I also would have liked a bit more flexibility in adjusting how non-high def signals are displayed. Overall this is a great machine and I would recommend it for the price."
1,great tv for about 2 and a half years,"At about that time white dots will appear first one or two, and then more and more every day. Samsung will not stand behind product knowing they have a major problem. Just do a google search and type in samsung dlp white dots and you will be as shocked as i was. It's a shame because this tv has a really nice picture, but you'll be looking at a big repair bill in about three years.Buyer beware!!!!"
5,The way to go.,I dont know what else to say other than. I dont think i will ever get tired of looking at this tv. I am still amazed with it. When friends come over they are also impressed with the picture quality. Did alot of research before purchasing and i believe Samsung is the way to go.
3,NICE TV with Minor Flaws,"I just purchased the 61' Samsung DLP TV not too long ago and I must say that I am fairly impressed. Though the TV is very nice looking it did come with some minor scratches on the monitor, which looks to have been done by the movers pulling it out of the box. The HD channels are beautiful with the exception of minor lines that appear in the top break of the screen (during wide screen mode only) on certain HD channels, which I can do without. I am not sure if the lines are due to the TV or the service provider still investigating. The basic channels look so so I am assuming it is because of the newer technology (1080p) and the basic channels just haven't caught up...there is a lot of floating going on during the shows which is very frustrating. Well, all in all the picture is nice and the TV is beautiful..good buy."
4,Samsung TV,The TV is huge. It works pretty well. The overall picture is not as impressive as I thought it would be though.
5,Great Book!,"This book was easy to read, and full of timeless truths. I would recommend it to anyone who is ready to move forward."
1,Got Earth?,Of course you do. You live on it. That's about all you'll learn from this book. This book didn't do one thing it promised. It didn't help me at all.
1,Earth Energy: The Charlatan's Frontier,"According to Ms. Flora, the Earth is a great, big schoolhouse where we come to learn lessons. I certainly learned a lesson here. I learned the value of never buying another of Ms. Flora's series of books. The books, Earth Energy included, give information anyone can find on-line, speak in pedantic tones, and are filled with threats about what happens to people who don't listen to Ms. Flora's fabulous advice. Of course, she doesn't call it advice--she calls it ""spiritual truth"" but the only spiritual truth you'll learn by reading this book or any of her others is the one spoken by P.T. Barnum--""There's a sucker born every minute."""
5,"Heavenly vocals, great beats","This album has become my primary workout soundtrack. I love to run with this album on my iPod - it really gets me running hard keeps me going. Kristy's vocals get stronger with every release, but with this album, they took an exponential leap forward. Not only do the vocals hold a great deal of emotion, but they are so pure and crisp and she uses the full extent of her range. Outstanding tracks are ""Let Me Tell You Something,"" ""Illuminate,"" ""Truth,"" and my favorite track on the entire album ""Going Under.""A high energy release that's perfect for working out, getting down on the dance floor or just for playing any time you want to get your heart pumping. This album is highly recommended."
5,The Azoic did it again!,"The follow-up to their successful ""Forward "" and ""Conflict"" releases, ""Illuminate"" returns with a further cultivation of The Azoic's sound and style that will leave you wanting more! A solid blend of electronic dance that encompasses everything from Trance to Futurepop, Industrial, and Synthpop. Twelve passionate dance tracks, including a cover of Animotion's 80's hit ""Obsession"" featuring a guest appearance from Frank Spinath of Seabound! On Nilaihah."
4,A powerful look into ancient and modern day chinese cult.,"Christopher Lambert is a bussiness man working in japan, when he meets a beautiful woman little does he know his life is going to get alot more complicated.The woman is killed and he has been marked for death by an ancient Japenese cult known as the Makato.This clan is widely known to have masterd the art of ninjitsu but he has seen the master of this cult and lived to tell about it his name is Kinjo and noone outside of his clan has ever seen him.Christopher Lambert only knows one way to get out of this fight to the death.It's an age old battle and now it has begun.It was intresting to see in this DVD that this was filmed in Japan. You will also get a trailer and production notes it's a must see for fans of the martial arts genere."
4,Ninja Lovers' Dream,"This movie is probably one of Christopher Lambert's best to come out in recent years. For those of us who grew up to him wielding a sword in Highlander, we get a sense of nostalgia watching him dog his way through Japan, chased by a cult of ninja."
3,Guilty Pleasure,Ninja on a bullet train. Thats the movie right there. Everything else can be skipped.
4,"A good movie , DVD Special Feature ???","I like this movie a lot !!.But the only complain is that on the DVD Cover said Special Feature : Spanish subtitules, Scenes, etccc..... and there is none of this, no subtitules, no menu , nothing at all !!! The movie star right away ..........."
1,Where was the editor?,There are so many technical inaccuracies in this text and so many problems with syntax that one wonders if there was any attempt to proof-read on the part of the publisher. The bibliography and footnotes are the most valuable part of the book.
2,Did ANYONE fact check this book?,"A decent account of the naval portion of the Civil War in the Atlantic, marred by sloppy editing, and inexcusable mistake. the author TWICE claims an event took place after Second Bull Run (Aug 1862) when he's still discussing 1861 events. Then he describes a 51"" thick steel armor for an ironclad! And goes on to claim that no ships were sunk by submarine between the Civil War and the sinking of the Lusitania (May 1915) even though U boats had been attacking and sinking British ships since the previous fall of 1914! Other parts of the book use repetition of phrases and sentences, giving the appearance of a book cut and pasted together with poor editing. This mars the story. An additional problem is that the author gives no proper comparison when he discusses gun sizes -- mixing 32 lbers and 12"" guns, without ever giving the reader any indication of how these compared."
4,"Interesting, credible, knowledgeable",This historical book is certainly worth reading if you are at all interested in naval history.
2,seat won't stay up!!!!!!,"I saw this seat and thought it would be the perfect solution so that my son would not have to take his potty seat on and off the toilet seat. I thought it would be more sanitary and also make much less clutter in the bathroom. I was only HALF right. The seat WON'T stay up for the boys in the house to go #1. VERY annoying and we have to tell any male friends that come over to ""hold the seat"" when they go. I guess it would be great for a girls only house...except it still presents a problem when trying to clean. I have to clean one handed while holding up the seat with the other. We did install per directions. Great concept only wish it worked as well the idea."
4,Perfect for families with children,"With 3 little ones under the age of 4, this toilet seat is great. I do not have to store and clean a removeable ring or do not have to have a training potty on the floor. The children's seat fits nicely in the top when not in use and is easy for the kids to use when needed. Quality of seat is nice and well constructed. I love it."
3,Family Seat MDF Antique Pine,Works well for my daughter but I find I have to clean up between the two seats often.
4,Excellent idea,This seat works just as the picture shows. Its excellent quality and not cheaply made at all. It made all the difference for my daughter and she is now potty trained! Thank goodness. :)
2,not for a 10 yr old boy,"Wasn't what we had expected. Other reviews prompted us to try this, but not for a 10 yr old boy. Too dancey and not challenging enough."
4,Nice workout a bit too hard for Special Ed kids,The workout is nice but moves a bit too fast for my special ed kids. They still enjoy it but just skip some of the moves - they can perform the move - Shaun T just transitions too fast from one move to the next for them.
5,A Book That Finally Got My Grandson's Attention,"I purchased this book 2 years ago from a street vendor and I thought it would be a good book because my grandson is African American, and I thought it would be something he could relate to. He was 3 at the time. I didn't realize how much he would come to love this book. It has beautiful pictures, the faces are so gentle and it seems so real that it's hard to believe it's a story. He's going on 5 and this book has been through all his rough and tumbling yet at bed time it's still his favorite book to go to sleep to. I would recommend this book for anyone."
4,'Space Daze'(Cleopatra) Varioua Artists,"As long as this 2-CD release has been out, I couldn't believe that no one had ever reviewed it before. 'Space Daze' is a decent 2-CD retrospect that is mainly for 'new patrons' who might need a proper introduction to the field of electronic, ambient, space rock and underground progressive music. Also might serve the purpose of giving a nifty piece of classic and some more recent recordings of the featured artists to an old school fan of such genres. A couple of the tracks on here, for example drew me to the original disc to where the tune was culled from, like Delerium's ""Dark Matter"", I went out and purchased the CD. Same with Pressurehed's ""Silver Bird"" and The Orb's ""Blue Room"". Other works I found enlightening include Hawkwind's B-side ""Adjust Me"", Ozric's ""Sploosh"", Spiral Realm's ""Elements"" and Coil's ""Nasa Arab"". Very nice to pull out and listen to now and then. Great cover, don't you think?"
2,Meanwhile in the REAL WORLD...,"Now I have to admit I was intrigued by the title. First few chapters were ok, but the book became progressively harder to read and considerably less realistic. First of all, the author should remember what Eleanor Roosevelt said ""Nobody can make you feel interior without your consent."" Just because a person claims someone else is a ""nobody"" that doesn't make it so. Secondly, no one will ever rid the world of rank. People by nature will form a pecking order. That's just the way it is. Without some sort of leadership, there would be anarchy and chaos in the world. Thirdly, the author is in academia, is male and is white, therefore a ""somebody"" if you go by his definition. So who is he to criticize when he is part of the problem rather than part of the solution?"
2,The concept is a bit half-baked,"Other than defining ""rankism"", there is not much else to this book. The author spends most of the book defining and giving examples of rankism. He does not talk much about ""overcoming the abuse of rank"", as the title suggests he will. He cites a few examples of where some groups are already making progress, but he does not really say what others should do, except maybe ""join together"". On some occasions, seems to be implying that the world is on its way to eliminating rankism, so we can just sit back and wait for this new utopia to come about.He also likes to compare rankism to both sexism and racism. He suggests that rankism can be eliminated, just like sexism and racism have been. Huh? There has been progress made against these other ""isms"", but Fuller really is living in an ivory tower if he thinks they no longer exist.""Somebodies and Nobodies"" does a decent job of pointing out that rankism exists, but does very little to provide answers."
2,self cleaning lever broke within a day,I was hoping for a brush that I could carry in my bag without it getting caught up in leashes and other stuff. But the pins do not retract fully into the brush and actually the lever broke about the fourth time I used it. The material is cheap.
1,Pride & Promiscuity : The Lost Sex Scenes of Jane Austen,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that many a hack writer thinks he/she can duplicate the style and wit of Jane Austen. Sadly, most are deluded. This dreadful title has nothing to offer fans of Jane Austen's works. Instead, the reader is offered a mediocre collection of ""sex farce"" short stories which suffer from two fatal flaws -- they are neither farcical nor sexy. Avoid this book."
1,Save your money and your soul!,"Ok, I, like other reviewers, bought this book because I thought it would be an entertaining piece in the style of Jane Austen containing jane austen's characters. While it does use Jane Austens characters, the style is superficially similar (at best) to the great author. I wasn't expecting more character or plot insight into Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but I also wasn't expecting something that virtually spits on these works! It was a WASTE of money and I had to pick up Persuasion and read it cover to cover just to get my soul back! I gave this book 1 star because it might be an ok read for those who don't have Jane Austens books deeply engrained in their hearts."
2,Terrible waste of money,This book was a huge disappointment. The story lines made no sense whatsoever and it truly detracted from the original stories.
1,I was Duped!,"Ok, so I'm a little slow at times...or I am just far too trusting! Either way, I was badly let down by this book. Standing in the book store, holding in my hands what I thought was a historical gem and a literary revelation, I read the claims by the authors that this was the ""real"" thing. Hooray!I rushed home to read it, and no more than 30 seconds later, I realized that this was obviously a parody. I felt duped. Because it is a parody? No. I have a sense of humor (although I *really* wanted it to be real) But, as someone else has already mentioned, never in 200+ years could a true fan stretch the imagination far enough to believe that this was written by Jane Austen. It was 21st century grammer and *yes*, punctuation, staring me in the face. Oh well, I can always turn it in to my local library for a freebie swap.The bottom line: If you are not into accuracy, buy it. If you are truly a fan of Ms. Austens, reread the real thing and use your erotic imagination instead."
2,Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jand Austen,"I was dreadfully disappointed in this book. It sounded as though it was going to be a good laugh, but it turned out to be the most boreing book I have ever read. My recommendation is save your money it is not worth it."
1,Be wise and save your money,"Being a huge fan of Jane Austen's work, I was appalled by this book. I found no humor in any of the stories. I have thrown the book away and consider it a total waste of money."
3,Pride and Repugnance,"I'm sorry I hated it! I bought something I thought would be different! I guess, maybe, I should have reviewed it more. I'm giving it three stars though, because although I hated it, it was well written and just OKAY. I wouldn't read it again though!"
1,Even for One Dollar Pass This By,I don't expect to buy this book and read about people doing nedlework I would expect however that the sex scenes are somewhat either funny or a little hot or both but real in some sense of the word. This has book has one scene about Jane that made me almost burn it. I was raised to believe if you cannot say something nice don't say anything at all. So I will stop because I cannot find anyhting else nice to say.
2,meh.,"It's a fun premise, but it's a pretty light development. Most of the scenes are only mildly funny, and once the delightful thrill of being bad wears off, they become almost boring. On the other hand, the Darcy/Elizabeth scene is utterly hilarious. The prose is solid, but hardly Austenian. Since the entire book takes at most an hour or two to read, it's really not worth the cover price, unless you intend to pass it around to your friends."
3,Willing Suspension of Disbelief MANDATORY,"My friends and I spent last weekend hooting over this book. Yes, it's absolutely irreverent. No, it's not terribly plausible. Certainly, not all the stories are particularly funny......BUT......just read, I ask you, the chapter about Mr. and Mrs. Collins. See if you can read it without laughing aloud.Ironically, it's far better-written than most of the sequels to Austen's works. Naughty as it may be, it's also dead on with respect to characterization and situation - something most sequel authors seem to dismiss as unimportant. My only complaint with the book is my suspicion that it has been heavily padded; in other words, the authors had two or three really funny ideas, but the other chapters are more vulgar and forced than amusing.Give it a try, though. If you're not repulsed by naughtiness (it's not porn - just sort of sweetly absurd)and you're not such a purist as to be horrified at the conceit, you might like it."
1,"Witty idea, but disappointing writing","This book's inventive claim is that the scenes it contains were cut from Austen novels by censors. Actually, they were cut by good editors--it's hard to sound like Jane Austen and this author misses by a mile, so the little essays just sound precious. Sorry, but its leaden prose, and surprisingly passionless given its subject. Unlike a few other reviewers, I had no objection to the idea of eroticizing the classics, but this book doesn't, in many ways, pull it off."
2,"I'm damning with faint praise, here...","Oh, so disappointing! I very much looked forward to this sexy parody of the beloved Jane Austen; such a shame it just doesn't work. While the style is often quite close, there are just too, too many jarring modernisms that destroy the necessary suspension of disbelief. And... while there are some quite funny bits, there are more that aren't. It needed a good edit - but that would very likely have left the authors without a book. I should think Jane Austen would have approved of and enjoyed the idea, as one who certainly had a sense of humour, but as a perfectionist in writing I doubt she'd have approved of the execution."
1,ADDS INSULT TO INJURY,"If I could rate this book lower I most certainly would, -5000 would be too high! I was never so disappointed in my entire life. If this is Jane Austen I am Jack the Ripper! I waited with such anticipation being an avid fan of Jane Austen. This is most certainly NOT Jane Austen! It is an insult to the intelligence of Jane Austen fans. This is nothing but ... plain and simple. Anyone who believes Mr. Darcy would seduce Elizabeth outside in plain view, her Aunt and Uncle only a short distance away do not know Mr. Darcy. This would be an abhorrence to him, of this I am certain! And who in their right mind would believe Fanny Price would even consider a role in the play and particularly that role! It is absurd and I can not believe any Jane Austen reader could believe this to be her work. This is ... and nothing else!! IN SHORT - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY!"
2,Tripe.,"I bought this under the mistaken impression that it was factual. Yes, I read the introduction and faux authentication by ""Elfrida Drummond"" who it turns out is the author's husband. Nowhere before the commencement of the book did it say that this was a farce. That's what upset me. Once I found out the truth there was no reason to continue reading it. If it wasn't written by Ms. Austen, why continue? If Ms. Eckstut had been forthright about how she billed the book, I think many of us would have been more forgiving."
3,Not what you'd expect...,"This is absolutely nothing like any of Austen's novels. However, it was written by Austen herself, and as such, makes for interesting reading. I was in stitches at some points, although it's not for the faint-hearted, or easily embarassed. The content is more explicit than you would expect, but I enjoyed the book, although I will admit that I had to take it in several sittings in order to make it through. It's a fascinating insight into the other side of Austen, and as the editor says, Austen evidently wanted this to be read. But if you're looking for cosy Lizzy and Darcy scenes, this isn't the book for you."
5,Great Little Book,This book is short and sweet and offers some great advice that you don't have to wade through chapters and chapters to find. I recommend this book for EVERYONE who is in a step-family situation.
3,Incorrect product information.,"I was really looking forward to viewing this item when it arrived. And it looks like a fun movie, but.... I do agree with the other reveiws in that the video clarity is very bad. The transfer is obviously from a very low-quality VHS tape. What really ruined it though was the lack of subtitles--despite Amazon's assertion that the item IS subtitled. It would be nice if Amazon exerted some measure of quality control regarding the product details."
1,Terrible composter,"Really lousy investment on my part. When we first set it up, the lid locked (with some difficulty) but as someone else mentioned, the black plastic warps and then you can forget about ever getting the lid to lock again. Even prior to the lid refusing to lock, it was very difficult to rotate the barrel - once it was full, it takes a lot of force to flip it. Now I have a huge black plastic indestructible barrel that is doing me little good for making compost - could have bought a trash can and drilled a few holes in it - could have saved a lot of $$.Don't buy this."
2,Not so helpful,"This book was recommended to me all over the place when I wanted to know more about music therapy. As a parent of a child on the autism spectrum who was very interested in music therapy, I did not find it so helpful or hopeful, for that matter. Dorita Berger's book, Music Therapy, Sensory Integration and the Autistic Child was very good."
4,"Komakino Astounds, the Rest is Average","Although there are some enjoyable tracks on Trance Europe 2, only the inclusion of Komakino's ""Beyond Your Dreams"" propels this CD to 4 star status. ""Beyond.."" is one of the greatest Trance tracks I've heard, nearly comparable to my number-one Trance piece, ""Greece 2000"". Various beats, sounds, and even a bit of voice, are woven together into a supremely hypnotic 6 minute experience. Unfortunately, while I'm glad I bought the CD and discovered Komakino, I can't recommend it in it's entirety. Other high points: track 1 (another Komakino, good but not superlative) and track 5. The rest are OK but, ultimately, forgetable."
1,CD quality does not serve Cliff well !,"Finally this Cliff Richard CD ""21 Today"" is on the market, but what a disapointment.There is nothing wrong with Cliff & The Shadows and nothing wrong with the songs, but this Hallmark CD issue, has been copied direct from an old LP record (scratches and everything like we heard them on LP's back in the sixties.) I had hoped for a better CD quality, especially in honour of Sir Cliff Richard and The Shadows. They do not deserve this poor CD copy from Hallmark. Bjarne, Denmark."
2,Not much more than a toy,"I purchased the Bushnell 'Night Watch' monocular with the expectation ofusing the device for night time boating. I have been quite disappointedin both the optical quality of the image as well as its light amplificationperformance. Light amplification, as other reviewers have noted, doesnot seem appreciably better than what most people can achieve witha fully dark adapted eye. As long as the viewing field can befully illuminated by the infrared LED builtin to the unit, an acceptableimage can be obtained at short range. In my experience, the practicallimit of this mode of use is perhaps 100 ft.The optics in the unit also seem quite poor - I notice significant distortionat the edges of the image seen. Not entirely sure if this is from the lensesor from the imager, but the effect is quite annoying.My recommendation would be to pass on purchase of this particulardevice."
3,Bushnell Night Watch Review,"Bushnell's has a very fine place in the nightvision market with their product Night Watch. It meets the price that affords most people the chance to own night vision. Of course it doesn't have the range or the illumination of the gen2, gen3, or 4 but I purchased two for less than I would have paid for the upper class models. Very good product from a very good company."
2,Monocular 2x24 Bushnell,I ask one of this used item NV and it arrived me with damage or bad. I returned it and I not yet my refund... Thenk you...
4,Night vision fun,It was a gift for friends who live out in the woods. Now they can see what they fear. City folks....
3,Bushnell NW.,"User manual is not good enough explaining how to use and set up for first time using.Function is not what I was expecting, however is my first time using this so meyabe performance is kind of standard in the market."
1,Can I give Zero Stars??,"Defective? Or just doesn't work? You tell me, Bushnell. But for $150, I don't expect perfection, but, I do expect to see more than 5 inches away from the end of the camera lens. Horrible. Bushnell should be ashamed of themselves."
5,"Pour Some Wine, Light A Candle and enjoy","Marvin, Teddy and Luther: A Smooth Urban Jazz Love features a nice twist on some of the most beloved slow jams from three premier balladers. Standouts include David Mann's covers of Luther's So Amazing & If Only For One Night. The disc is geared around slow and steady seduction -- a sexy dance followed by whatever the listener has in mind later for his or her dance partner. There's something particularly innovative or unique in the arrangements of these ballads. Everybody loves these songs, and they provide spotlights for the principal musicians while making for some nice late-night soul swaying."
4,Overall great laptop stand,"I originally bought this for my gf as I had the .i.lap stand. When it came in I tried it out and I liked that it was one piece. Gave my gf the other one and kept this less expensive one for myself!There is a lip in the front your laptop is held in place but none on the sides, which is ok by me but ""could"" cause your laptop to slide if you are willy nilly with it. It has grooves in it so the heat can transfer up and out the back.Pros:-one piece construction-can fold laptop and carry in S curve-can put papers in band on bottom of stand (you have to see)-no heat on lap-solid material and fabric wont scratch-fits all kinds of laptops (I have a macbook 13"")Cons-sometimes slides left to right (not that big of a deal)-No wrist pad-purchased the extremely expensive .i. lap before I bought this one!!!!-fabric doesn't dissipate heat as well as metalWould recommend. A-"
5,love it,This laptop platform is great. It keeps air moving under the laptop and it's comfortable to use when on my lap. Good price on Amazon.
5,"Works great, just what i needed","Glad I got this item, very neat, light, fits in my bag, does a great job at keeping the laptop cool and I use a Macbook Pro 15''. Would really recommend it after trying several other products.."
3,Allsop Cool Channel,An inexpensive way to keep your lap cool. It would be better if the lip was a little taller to keep the laptop from slipping over the top.
3,Not bad but not comfortable,"Pros: light and thin, easily transportable. Cooling function seems to work just fineCons: Lip on the bottom to keep the laptop off your lap is uncomfortable-ish. The platform is lightly padded but the weight of the laptop still presses it into your thighs.Also not big enough to rest entire laptop on. This seems to be for a smaller laptop than the one I have."
2,"It's a good laptop STAND, not a good laptop COOLER","My HP notebook gets very hot in the lower left area. This product only shields your legs from the heat, but it does not actually cool down the computer, nor does it disperse the heat throughout the surface as claimed by some reviewers. Well, maybe it cools down the computer by 1 degree Fahrenheit...Get a fan-based cooler if your computer gets really hot or you turn on your laptop all the time.The only good thing about this product is the angle of elevation, which is very comfortable for typing, so this product can only be a good stand, not a good cooler."
1,"Not for laptops bigger then 15""","I purchased this item thinking, based on description and reviews, that it would work with my 18"" HP. That was not true. As soon as I put the laptop on it, it started to tip over."
3,Laptop tends to slide over lip,"I got this for my Macbook Pro 15"". It has a mild cooling effect--I'm honestly not sure about the padded fabric design, even with the channels. But the bigger flaw is that the lip isn't sufficiently curved enough to keep the computer from sliding down, or tipping up backwards. I'm keeping it because it's useful as a way to lift the monitor a bit when I'm working at my kitchen table, but ordering another cooling pad."
1,"Don't bother, it sucks!!!!","The worst documentary on Nostradamus we have ever seen. The acting by the presenter is horrible and the rest of it is just plain stupid. It doesn't really give you any good information on Nostradamus's predictions and none of his predictions for the future.Our recommendation, Pass on this one!"
3,Interesting and amazing.,"This video summarize Nostradamus' poems and predictions. You've read or heard most of the cases before, but they're up to date more than ever. See what happens at the end of 1999....!It's worth seeing."
3,Good but not outstanding,"This DVD doesn't take full advantage of the picture quality available to the format. I do like the recreations, and you have the advantage of being able to look at it when you want instead of waiting for cable channels to play it.The graphics are decent although you can tell its a transfer from tape. The trivia quiz doesn't give a final score and it isn't very long. Despite these shortcomings, it's a great buy. If you're building your library right now as I am, this makes a great addition."
3,Get the regular version,"I bought the limited edition so I could also play heroes III. FORGET IT!!! You have to trick the game to even load a save file, and every time you try to get the second quest of a campaign to load you're kicked out!! There is NO manual whatsoever with the game, NONE. They give you an old troubleshooting manual, that's it. (Seriously). I had to look up units on old gaming sites to understand what they can do. I've played some of heroes V as well, and THAT game kicks me out sometimes too! Don't get me wrong, the game itself is quite attractive, (the vampire unit especially), but it's really hard to appreciate a game that has so MANY BUGS! Not only that, but UBI soft did not release a map editor for Heroes V. What's a heroes' game without an editor?? I say, save your money until they start releasing some patches!!! I am very displeased with the lack of quality involved in the product. This thing costs $60 for extras that DON'T WORK!!!!"
4,Love this game! Where were the expansions??,I love Heroes of Might and Magic and used to play Heroes 3 a ton when I was younger so for old times sake I purchased this set only to be disappointed that it didn't come with the expansions! What's the use of a boxed set if it doesn't come with the expansions? So a warning to those wanting to purchase this... Be sure you understand that it doesn't come with the expansions or if it says it does you may want to contact the seller directly to make sure...
5,This is a really fun read!,"My wife, a Novosibirsk native, bought me this book for father's day. I have spent some time in Novosibirsk myself, so I was intrigued by the subject matter and location. I had some doubts after reading the dustjacket, thinking it might be a dry how-to manual on how to start a business in a hostile environment. I could not have been more wrong.Mr. Blakely spins a great story about a few years spent in an interesting and exotic place, getting to know the local people and even falling in love. This is anything but dry. Read this book, it is money well-spent. And by the way, he is not kidding about the beauty of Siberian women, they are stunning. I know, I married one myself."
2,Know what you are ordering,This may fit the sunroof listed but The auto port maker had 2 designs for seals. Appearntly they do not have the first style anymore. That is improtant when you need a good seal in the roof of you car. I found this out after ordering and seeing it compared to my original seal. Customer service did not know any more about this item than was listed in the product listing.
5,Good book to review current theology,"I've followed Lightner for nearly thirty years and consider him to be theologically accurate. However, if you like to ""play"" with the Bible, you won't like Lightner, who writes for more serious students. His book is good to review the range of conservative opinion on topics of interest to serious Bible students."
4,Good read,"A journey through early native lands, tradition, and belief. Engaging and interesting with well developed characters. If you like a story based in what could have happened check this book out"
4,IT'S STILL FICTION,This was an enjoyable read but the author has set her mystery in a prehistoric era and has her characters behaving socially as Anglos. Her Native Americans are engaging in romantic activities familiar to us all. She did describe living quarters documented by science. Her descriptions of the area her drama is set in seem fairly accurate. That's really my only criticism of this book. Her characters are acting like White Anglo Saxon's in many respects but then she quite frankly states her book is a work of fiction. It's still an entaining book and I'll be downloading more to enjoy.
2,tangled,"Too many Indian names, too confusing to keep track of whos who, swithing back and forth too often ab out each character"
4,Enjoyable read,"I enjoy historical fiction. This drug a little in parts, but overall it was an imnteresting read. Price was right."
4,enjoyed the book,It was what I expectedEnjoyed the story line and charactersthe author writes well and the researchseemed thorough.
3,Not quite right for me.,I jut couldn't get into it. This was not my kind of novel. This would be good for someone who like this kind of story.
3,Not as good as other prehistoric novels I have read.,I did not find the story line as interesting as say Jean M. Auel writing or those of Karah Quinney
4,Another in a great series,"This book epitomizes others by the Gears. Like them, it is an intriguing way to learn more about our Native American forebears. There is plot, action, history and a wealth of knowledge about a very important part of our American history. It made me want to visit this part of the country and see where these people lived. I have a warning, though: read one of the Gear's fine books about the aboriginal ancestors of this country and you may get hooked on them as I did. This is the fourth one I have read, and I am now on the fifth!"
4,People of the Earth,"I enjoyed it very much however, I wish I'd started reading them in order. Now I'm catching up. They write an intriguing story."
3,"It's an interesting read, but not the final say","The book is fairly well laid out and written, but I have to object to his method. He only reads the Bible and understands it at ""face value."" Since we read into Jesus' parables deeper than their face value; it seems reasonable that the rest of the Bible can be ""read into"" and interpreted as well.He dances over a few items, but the author apparently believes ""the mark of the beast"" will literally mean people have a 666 tattooed on their foreheads. And when scriptures mention ""soldiers marching on Jerusalem with spears and bucklers,"" he thinks that modern armies will revert to using sharp sticks and small shields when going to war. The author needs to step back and bring a little common sense into the mix; clearly there are cases when the prophecies need to be interpreted and ""brought up to date.""It's an interesting read, but I would check out other books before making up your mind."
5,Worth the extra money compared to the f/1.8,"I was considering buying the f/1.8 for its lower price; however, I decided to go with the f/1.4D. Why? I was told it has a more solid, metal mount compared to the f/1.8 (I haven't inspected the 1.8 to verify this) and it's slightly faster. Is this worth the increase in price? When I realized I'd be using this lens for years, the answer was 'yes'. Why quibble over a few hundred bucks for a piece of equipment you'll be using for a long time with an even more expensive SLR. Has the extra 1/2 stop made any difference- YES. Shooting indoors or at night, I've had to open it up all the way to 1.4 many times, even at very slow shutter speeds (1/60, 1/30). As long as I accounted for the thin depth of field, I got excellent, sharp photos. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4,"AWESOME LENS, CHEAP PRICE!","If you want a standard nikkor prime lens, this is the one to get! It's cheap and works great! It has a cheap(ish) build, not pro quality like their metal lenses. But in this class and focal length. You really have no choice. But it is a trooper. If you want this lens with a metal case, then go for the old manual version of this lens. They are more or less identical. Minus the auto focus."
3,little disappointed,"The lens itself works good, but until you can use them...To connect it to the camera (Nikon D300) it needs some work because the connection points are poorly fabricated, the thread is sluggish.Also the cap itself is a mess. No Nikon cap, only a white plastic thing that hardly covers the sensitive connecting points, nothing to screw, only to plug.If you are somewhere dusty or your camera bag is not 100% dust free - you will get no protection.So I have to buy a real Nikon cap to protect my new NIKON lens. That is pretty crazy.When I had a look onto the lens, it was completely clear: made in China.This has been a lesson to me.Before I buy lens, I definitely will ask where they had been made,I do not want to have poor fabricated cheap things for that costs."
4,"Classic lens, still very useful","The Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 is a classic 135-format lens that is still invaluable as a portrait lens or for taking advantage of the fantastic existing light capabilities of today's digital SLRs. Its optics are excellent, but one would expect that from a 50mm. I only gave it 4 stars because it is not necessarily the best value out there: it's still a plastic-barrelled lens with no SWM or VR, and it's more than twice the cost of af/1.8. You're basically paying for the extra 2/3 stop of optical speed and the shallow depth-of-field. All that said, the lens is very fast and very sharp and it's a joy to use."
5,Awesome!,This lens is one of the best I own so far! It surely is a really good portrait lens. I use it on my D40x. There is no auto focus but that is not a problem. It is fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it and the price is not bad for it at all!
2,Too much Chromatic aberration...,"I dont know if this was the copy that i had received, but there were too much of color fringes from f1.4 to f2.8... i have a tokina 16-50 f2.8 and it doesnt fringe at all.being a nikkor glass, i didnt expect this kind of performance. rest all was good - construction, focusing speed, etc.another weird thing - even being nikon original stuff, the lens cap (camera body side) is just a translucent plastic cap, unlike the other sturdy covers that come in other nikon lenses.my reason of buying a f1.4 lens is totally defeated due to the fringing issue and hence a 2 star."
3,This is not my old Nikon 50mm F/1.4,When I purchased this lens I was looking for a low light lens with the solid construction and exceptional performance I enjoyed with the 50mm F/1.8 lens I used 20 years ago with my Nikon F series. What I got instead was a mediocre made in China lens that hunts and is noisy when focusing. Very disappointed.I already have a the 18-200mm AF VRII lens from Nikon which is an exceptional lens.I was looking to use the 50mm in lower light situations but the lens is not worth the $350 so I'll be returning this one to Amazon.
4,is a dream,"I waited 2 yrs to buy this lens, and let me say one thing.. ITS AMAZING... the DOF and the creamy backgrounds are amazing, Exspecially on a D700, or even on a D70s. As for portraits outdoors, indoors sharp and love availible light(natural). On lanscapes brillant, I love it. Exspecially on my D700, I got star effect shooting my Christmas lights this yr...Yes it is exspencive but worth it's weight in gold."
5,Greatest lens in my bag!,I just picked this lens up today and all I can say is WOW! I've been looking at this lens for a while and I'm so glad I finally got it. I have the 50mm f1.8 and I can definately see the difference in my photos. If you are thinking about getting this lens stop thinking and just get it. I love it!
5,Fantastic,"A wonderful and versatile piece of glass. Don't get me wrong, the 50 1.8 is a great lens and a great bargain, but I gotta say that the little extra .4f is money well spent."
5,"Get this, not the F/1.8.","I had initially tried the 50mm f/1.8 version and hastily returned it due to its soft image characteristics at f/1.8. This lens on the other hand maintains great sharpness at f/1.8 trough f/16. While it is more expensive than the f/.1.8, it is worth the extra money if you are looking for a a lens that you can actually use at f/1.4. SWM focusing would have been nice, but the focusing on this lens is quiet and fast. I am very pleased with this gem's performance on my D300s."
4,"*Very* fast, but consider the f/1.8","I've been using this lens extensively with my D70. It lets me shoot without a flash in low-light situations where other photographers are complaining about not even being able to focus. I'm often able to even turn off the autofocus light, which allows for very natural pictures: the subject isn't hit with an anti-redeye flash or focusing beam, so they don't flinch and change expression. It produces excellent portraits, with the background artistically blurred.Are there shots that I've gotten with this lens that I couldn't have gotten with the ($99) 50/1.8? Yes, a few. Most of them were from weddings (indoor, flash inappropriate, motion), or at night with no light sources within 20ft. For the vast majority of my pictures, though, the slower lens would have been more than adequate (even in dim light, I'm often shooting at f/2-f/4). If I had to choose between the two today, I'd probably get the cheaper lens."
5,Night Shooter,"I avoid using flash at all costs, and this gets the job done in low-light conditions. This lens is amazingly sharp too- probably one of the sharpest of all Nikon glass today. Regardless of what I am carrying in my bag, when sharpness is my ultimate goal in a photo, I always use this one over any others. If landscapes or people are your goal, and you want to harass your subject with as little (or no) flash as possible, this is the lens for you. Does black & white beautifully too."
4,"great lens, in general","On the positive side, when stopped down, it is very sharp. Has nice Bokeh when used as a portrait lens. However, I'm not sure the f1.4 is all that useful, as the lens gets soft, with low contrast, and a sort of whitish haze to the image when wide open. Not sure it's that much of an upgrade over the slower, cheaper f1.8"
5,Must Have Lens,"Great little lens - I definitely consider it a must have. For me, the extra stop from the 1.8 is worth it."
3,Great lens but you may want to consider spending the $$$ on something else,"I bought this lens to match w/ my D200 because I wanted a fast, small, quality prime lens to walk around with. The APC DOF factor of 1.5 makes this like a 75mm lens on 35mm format (ie it's a bit of a tweener from normal to portrait). Looking back I may have better put the money towards a 60mm micro or a Tokina macro; both better portrait lenses which also work for macro photography.Alternatively, I could have saved around $100 and bought the 1.8 50mm which, I understand, performs just as well.Just the same, I love photos that come through this lens."
3,Good product,I have used the 50mm f/1.4D and it has allowed me to take pictures in low light situations. It does everything I wanted it to do.
4,Decent retrospective.,"I know it is difficult to satisfy everybody when presenting an overview of any genre of music and the perspectives of what is Industrial music are varied and quite personal. The style here leans more toward the sounds of the better known albums or ""hits"" by Front 242 and Ministry although neither is included in this collection. So for those who want to expand their exposure to electronic music such as dark wave or gothic/industrial then this will please you. The inclusion of Brian Eno's Third Uncle is odd as it is to me more likely to be influential to punk as seen by Bauhaus' cover of it. Enjoy."
5,Simply brilliant,This really deserves all the respect it can possibly get. Callinicos is THE perfect example of a hard-headed Marxist that is capable of making clear and convincing... Excellent...
5,4 different strageties,"Get 4 different Theme decks, each with their own colors combinations and strageties built into them. Saves time from having to build a deck from scratch and also helps to build in your overall card base. If you don't like how a deck works, take it apart or modify it and use the box to help protect your cards from damage."
3,4 seperate decks,ok this piticular set is common among people in my mtg club alot of people use them i dont personaly but one thing i can tell you from experience while playing these decks they're are better but price wise its ok and they're strong decks just i would think about it unless you modifye these decks they are not worth purchasing
4,First Communion gift,"The doll was just what I wnated for a granddaughter's First Communion. She loved it. However, a month later, I found it cheaper in a cataloge."
4,Great book for a present,"I bought this book for my brother's (who's gay) birthday, and he loved it! The shortness of the essays made it quick to read and he read out entire ones to me over the telephone, and I laughed at quite a few parts myself. The whole leading/following dance thing is also applicable to straight people too!A good buy and a good laugh.-Diane, Dayton"
1,OK if they were teenagers,"The premise was so good and it could have been such a nice story. The first 1/3rd was very enjoyable. Then, these two very immature people started acting very immaturely in a very boring, long drawn out, and without reason type of way. After the little incident that was there to bring the story drama, the rest of the book was all ""I love him, but, he's too rich for me"" & ""I love her, but, I can't stop whining long enough to do anything about it"". Add annoying family members and interfering friends and you have an excellent YA story for the 10 to [..]crowd, but, a real snoozer for adults."
3,"A light read, the story falters a bit","As far as Christmas romances go, there isn't much Christmas in this one really. It's pleasant enough. The couple is dymanic and likeable. But the storyline keeps stumbling, without enough to really keep it going. They think this person is the one, then one thinks they're too different (over some silly reason), then they think person is the one....rinse and repeat. It drags out too much and the sudden proposal is very out of place. It tied up way too quickly.It's not bad, but it isn't great, as Christmas stories go."
3,"I returned it and bought the f/1,4",Alot of different opinions in the review forums here on Amazon. I ended up sending this one back and buying the 1.4 as it just seemed more substantial in my hand. I know that is a soft reason to pay twice the price but I love my 1.4. For a more budget conscious person this is still a good lens though.
2,Wouldn't focus,"I had to return mine, it wouldn't focus on anything. I upgraded to the automatic one for an extra 100.. We'll see how it works when it comes in.. Hopefully yours works better.."
1,Did I get a bad one?,"Although this lens had great reviews on amazon... I received this lens and found that it was far from being a sharp lens as stated in reviews. I'm not sure if I had a defective lens, but this lens can't compare to the Nikon 35mm 1.8. That is the sharpest lens I've seen! Remember, you get what you pay for!"
2,Not compatible with D60,"When I researched a 50mm lens for my Nikon D60, this lens came up time and time again. I read the reviews and was excited to order it. When I received it, I quickly learned that it's NOT compatible with my D60 UNLESS I want to manually focus the lens myself. Um, no thanks! I want an AF lens. I have since learned that I need an AF-S lens. So, my review is poor based on the lack of information the link provided about it not being something that was automatic. It fit the camera, when I focused it manually, it took great photos, but I'm not in the business of manually focusing every shot. Sorry...."
2,Not good with a D60,"I like the lens, but I was sorely disappointed to find out that you the AF doesn't stand for AutoFocus for a D60. An equivalent lens for the Canon Rebel not only costs less, but will autofocus. I read that I need to order an AF-S lens to auto focus. Cheapest one here is the 35mm and its like $400."
2,disappointing,"Solid lens, but it is not compatible with the D60. The camera kept insisting that I open it to f22, and it would not autofocus. Very disappointing."
1,NOT auto-focus,"This was NOT an auto-focus lens for the Nikon D40X. It needs a camera with the motor in the camera. I got this to shoot pictures in a gym without flash (basketball, volleyball, rallies). Even though I maually focused the lens through the viewfinder, most of the pictures came out out of focus. It was alos difficult to get the right exposure settings. It just didn't work for what I wanted. I sent it back. Fortunately, JR Music took it back and issued a refund with no problems."
3,Autofocus doesn't work with older Nikon DSLRs,"The auto-focus in this lens does not work with older Nikon DSLR's, such as the D40x. Apreture settings will work, but I have to use the manual focus ring. Having said this, I am otherwise please with its performance."
3,Not impressive; Lose sharpness,"had used a brand new 50mm AF f/1.8D with D70s for less than 1 year; apparently f/1.8D is not a good prime lens for prosrecently bought one 50mm AF-S f/1.4G; and apparently prime f/1.4G outperforms f/1.8D A LOT;In short, if you can afford additional $300, go f/1.4G for sure."
2,Autofocus does not work with Nikon D3100,"Although the seller, PCNation, does not mention it in the item description, the auto focus function does not work with the Nikon D3100. Additionally, the D3100 only allows photos to be taken at f-stop setting F/22. If you are expecting to use this lens with the D3100 as an autofocus lens or as a manual lens using all f-stops, you will be disappointed. When I contacted PCNation to return the lens, they advised me there would be a 15% return processing fee, although they failed to explain that the lens does not work with the Nikon D3100. Had they done so, I would not have purchased the lens. So with paying for shipping and the 15% processing fee, I'm better off just keeping the lens as a paperweight. I will never make another purchase from PCNation."
2,Beware Nikon's Auto focus,"This lens was bought for my novice wife, who at the time was just getting into photography, and while I realize this is our fault for not doing more research, I wish Nikon/Nikkor was more upfront about what lenses will work with the internal autofocus.The lens is top notch, but for anyone looking for an autofocus lens, this is not one."
4,Nikon 50mm,I love this Nikon 50mm for its price. Although the auto focus doesn't function on my D60. SO i really need to have good hands and focus. But my friend bought the same one with D90 and works really great!
5,Love this lens!!,Just wanted to share with everybody how much I love this lens. I have shot Nikons for years and got lazy and went the zoom lens only route. Shooting with this lens has gotten me back to what I love about photography. The focus is extremely sharp and the shallow depth of field is absolutely gorgeous. This puts me back in control of the elements needed to make a really good photograph. I received this lens on a Tuesday and used it to shoot a wedding on Saturday. This lens put me back to where I needed to be with my wedding photos. It is an excellant portrait lens and does a really good job in low light situations. I would highly recommend this lens.
5,Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens,"Fantastic lens, especially given the price. Nikon's cheapest lens is also one of their best lenses. Used on a Nikon D90 and D7000.Performance:The photos that this lens produces are incredible. Dof is fantastic, and the bokeh is beautiful. Sharp images all around. I keep this lens on my D90 at night because the lens is small and has exceptionally good low-light performance.Design and Quality:Quality of the lens construction is good. Not as tough as some of Nikon's higher end lenses, but I have no worries about this lens breaking. Since it is a prime lens, there is no zoom ring, only a focus ring. The lens is very small and light, and is easy to carry around.Overall:Greattt buy. Highly recommended. If you've never tried a prime lens before, they're definitely worth it. Photo quality is just never quite as good with a zoom."
5,This was a best buy!,"I have had this lens 2 days and already I am in love. It takes amazing shots and so crystal clear. I love the F1.8!It really makes your subject pop. I can't believe i waited so long to buy it. If you are looking for a prime lens, this is a great option and the price is right. I saved $20 by buying on amazon instead of in store, and all i had to do was be patient for it arrival."
5,Worth every cent,"If you are a serious about photography, this is defn. a must buy. I was a bit hesitant coz this was over $100 but no regrets.Love how light the lens is.You can get an AMAZING depth-of-field when the subject is close by. If you have vibrant colour in the background, it looks phenomenal when blurred out.Since you cannot zoom using this lens, you really have to use your feet, move around, to make sure you are composing the photograph without unwanted elements.A prime lens is defn. a must buy."
4,great little lens,Right away I was amazed by the shots you can get with this little lens..well worth the small price too !
5,Nikon 50-mm f/1.8D AFNikkor Lens,"Seems to work exactly as advertised, as reviewed and as I wanted on my D200 and D70. A classic, quality Nikon lens and a great value. Everyone should have one for low-light situations and for the quality of the glass."
4,Great lens... no auto focus with D40 but in-focus indicator DOES work,"Bought to use with D40, knowing the auto focus wouldn't work. Had HORRIBLE difficulty getting focus and was going to return it when I realized that the 'in-focus indicator' (green dot) DOES work. Once I figured this out, it was a breeze to properly focus the lens manually and it has become a great part of my lens lineup. A must have for low light non-flash photography. Awesome value once I figured out how to focus it!"
5,prime lens,"I needed a prime lens for my Nikon D-5000, to use for digiscoping. It came in good condition, with a rubber cap and a filter that I do not use."
5,Cannot be beaten for the price,This lens is fantastic! I have done entire portrait shoots with this one lens. If you don't have any fast glass do yourself a favor and pick up this lens. I have some higher quality lenses but still find myself using my trusty 50mm.
5,Great mult-purpose lens,"I bought this lens back in 2006 right after I bought my Nikon D50. Back then I was a novice in regard to what a prime lens was vs. a zoom lens. This lens was inexpensive and I figured a good starter into prime lenses. I've used my lens for family photos, food photography and general indoor photos and the lens performs very well for personal use. I have had my lens for over 6 years and have never had a problem or been disappointed with a photo. The lens itself is lightweight, fast, sharp and has good bokeh. Overall it's a nice lens to have in your camera bag. I keep aNikon 52mm NC Filteron my lens to protect it from scratches which does not diminish the photo quality."
5,50mil devil,"It is really light and made for low-light situations. I enjoy that i can just shove it down my pocket and go out with one other lens. Situation changes? bam, 1,2,3 change and this 1,8 will help in most of dark places. I dont mean night-like darkness for shooting formulas, but inside a room, friends by the table or for portrait in studio.I use it on my D300 without any problem. Also got retractable screw-on rubber hood. Works all fine :)"
5,Hard to get more bang for your buck...,"An absolutely tack sharp lens, very much professional quality, for a tiny fraction of the price of professional glass. It does have it's dangers though. Nikon doesn't make any other comparable lenses that are this cheap. Once you use the 50/1.8, you'll find yourself doubting the quality of the rest of your non-pro lenses, and eyeballing lenses that you'll have to take out a second mortgage to pay for.It's obvious that all of the money went into the glass, as the actual construction of the lens leaves a lot to be desired. Entirely too much plastic.Out of focus rendition (""bokeh"") is decent, but nothing to write home about. A bit on the harsh side, but not distractingly so."
5,Jaw Drop,This lens really surprised me.. with only having 3 or 4 elements this thing focuses very quickly. the sharpness this lens produces is phenomenal. i got it for Christmas and used it for the first time in Chicago.. to say the least i left it on the whole 3 days.. never want to take it off. its really worth every cent.
5,Where is the sixth star?,"Love love love this lens. Great shallow field, can get a bit purple liney, but in the hundred dollar range, what do you expect? BUY IT!!!"
5,"The basics are the most treasured,","Fast, great bokeh, slams into focus on the D7000, has become the current 'walk around'.An invaluable lens for indoor, available light shots.Have used this lens for night time pitcha black outdoor shots, very useable shots at f2-3 ISO 1000 at 1/40."
5,it's simply the best lens i've ever used to date,"I bought this shortly after I moved up into SLR shooting. I'm currently a professional wedding photographer's assistant, and I have access to all his gear, which includes some really nice primes. This lens is less than a tenth of some of the lenses I use for work, but it at least matches them, if not beats them. At f4, it's simply superb, and even down at f2 it captures some incredible detail. I use a Nikon D40, and this lens hasn't left my camera since I got it, auto-focus or no. Give this lens a try, even if you're used to zooms - it's a fresh approach, you get better low-light performance, and moving around to frame your picture just right is just more fun."
1,I was not able to use it on my D50,"In all the reviews or specs it does not tell clearly if it is compatible with Nikon D50. i bought and could not use it, so i returned it."
2,BEWARE D60 USERS ***,"I received the lens, couldn't wait to use it in action. The lens has NO AUTOFOCUS with the D60!!! What an incredible disappointment! How could a Nikon lens not have AF on a camera that was just released? This makes no sense but it works fine on a d300...no fair! Shots are sharp but it stinks to go back in time and have to manually focus."
3,No autofocus for D3000 or other DX cameras; manual focus difficult,"I bought this lens for my D3000 not realizing the autofocus would not work on this particular model (nor on any DX models, apparently); I'm sure that's stated somewhere but I didn't see it. At first I figured no autofocus would be okay because I got a DSLR specifically so I could manually focus when I needed to, but then I discovered the lens also had no ground glass, rangefinder, or microprism to help me ensure a completely crisp, focused image. If this lens had even one of these features (okay, so my old Nikkor lenses spoiled me) I would have kept it because I love the DOF and appreciate having a lens for low-light conditions. Instead I'm returning it for the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX, which costs about $80 more but will auto-focus on my camera -- and also permits closer shots, which is a big plus since I also do product shots. All in all, a fine lens, but with several limitations I couldn't live with."
4,"Great Lens, but not the right one for my camera","I really like the low f-stop for this lens, which creates a sharp focus on the subject and a blurred background. I didn't realize that in order for it to work with my DSLR (I have an older Nikon D40), that I would only be able to use the manual focus. I believe that it auto-focuses with the later Nikon models. I just wish that I would have known or researched better to figure it out before purchasing, and I might have made a better choice. That being said, I do use this lens and love the photographic results that it provides."
3,Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR,The item was received in very good condition however was not what I had expected. I was disappointed that it was a manual focus and not an autofocus lens. Other than that it functioned well. I wear glasses and the manual focus doesn't always produce the most optimum of results.
3,"Beautiful pictures, narrow angle for digital multi-purpose","Rating it in terms of lens quality, I would give it 5 stars. The images are beautiful/perfect, and I love dark photography (and hate flash) so the speed is really convenient. Plus, the price is right.That said, since i got the 18-55mm 3.5 with VR, I haven't used the lens once. I found that the 50mm, on a digital camera, is too restrictive. I find myself backing up to get pictures, so if you're doing anything but portrait shots, it's not a good all-around lens. I plan on saving up for a 35mm 1.8. I've found 35mm to be optimal for everyday shooting, when it doesn't need to be too wide, nor zoomed in, but just what you'd consider normal."
3,You get what you pay for,"This lens is cheap, I first thought it was a great lens but after my photo experience improved over the years, I now can say that, this lens is far from perfect. it is just a cheap fast prime. Last week I have shoot some pictures with it and realized how much overrated this lens is. Bokeh is surprisingly bad especially for a prime lens. Many great pictures lost due to slow or inaccurate autofocus. And like ever reviewer has written, sharpness is exceptionally bad at wide apertures. I will never use it again, it is for sale to buy something better."
5,GREAT PRICE - GREAT PRODUCT,I really like this lens.Easy to use.Focus really quick.GREAT PRODUCT and EXCELLENT PRICE
4,good little lens,"I always carry my camera, but when it comes to ""just regular"" close range pics like at parties and just sitting around with family and friends this is the perfect lens. I can still be in the same room and not have to back all the way up. Pictures come out well even in low lighting."
4,excellent lens for portrait photography,ease of you with d-slr cameras and a qiute fast lens its a good buy forthe price.picture quality is very good at iso upto 800
5,Great Lens,If you want a great lens that doesn't cost a lot of money then this is the lens for you. By far it is my favorite lens in my camera bag.
5,Beautiful lens,"This lens is awesome. I've used it way more lately than any of my others. It's super-clear, and the F1.8 aperture is amazing, and quite handy. If you plan on taking pictures inside, especially of people, you can't go wrong with this guy.Keep in mind, there's no zoom! You get to ""zoom with your feet"". Which, for indoor shots of family events and such, really hasn't been a problem. And there's no auto-focus on the low-end Nikons (Though check out the range metering on the D60 to help ya with manual focusing). Also, you can't use the aperture ring -- you have to set it to locked. The camera will complain if it's not locked at the highest f-stop number (the camera sets the aperture through the software, you just have to set the ring to the higher f-number in order to mount it).Overall, awesome."
4,Great pictures but...,"I bought this lens for my Nikon D3000. This could by my mistake because I'm fairly new to the photography world, but the autofocus on the lens doesn't work on my camera. I read the details to prevent this, but I must have missed something. Either way, the lens takes GORGEOUS shots. I just have to work a little harder for them. Overall, I'm still pretty happy with the purchase. The lens is very light and easy to use."
4,Good Lens for Potraits,"I love everything about this lens except AF not supported by D40 and D60, D3000, D5000 cameras. Since I have a Nikon D5000, I need to use it manually. So for the people who have mentioned cameras should think before they buy if they will be comfortable with manual focus. Otherwise It is a great deal and great quality for the price."
4,Great Buy,This would be a great lense for an amateaur photographer or simple portraits. The bokeh is very strong but looking at the final pictures ther is a bit of vinegette with some. Overall great for the price though. Make sure you understand it is NOT a ZOOM lense but rather a prime lense. AND if you do not already have 52mm filter to protect the lense front you might want to buy it ahead of time as it does NOT come with one.. Ships quick and hassle free.. I ordered mine and it was at my doorstep within 3 days (about).. ready to take pictures... Good Luck!!
4,Does what is promised and more,"This lens lived upto its promise . In a recent trip to New York , I used it for low lighting , portrait, street shots and yes even landscapes. It is a gem of a lens and you just cannot go wrong with it , especially given the cost."
3,"Good lens, but unusable at f/1.8","[...]. My primary purpose for this lens was low light exposures where I wanted to use it wide open at f/1.8. Unfortunately, at f/1.8, the images are soft. At f/4 and smaller however, the images are crisp and very contrasty. Closer to f/22, softness creeps in again. At first I thought I too may have had a bad sample. But a second copy that I tried gave the same results. If you intend to use this lens between f/4 and f/19, it will produce excellent images. However, if you are looking to use it for high speed photography, shallow DoF or low light photography (i.e. wide open aperture), this lens may not be for you. I suppose that is to be expected for a lens that only costs $130!2-28-2010 Update: I've been using the 50mm f/1.4D since I returned this lens and performance at f/1.4 is superior. I definitely do not recommend the f/1.8 lens if your intention is to use it for low light shooting at f/1.8."
5,A must have!,"I primarily shoot a Nikon D200, and up until a couple days ago, only carried three lenses with me. They are the 12-24mm dx, the nikkor 80-200mm f2.8, and the 55mm micro (manual focus). I felt the need to get something in the ""middle range"" for street photography, but have previously returned every mid-range zoom I've ever bought. This lens was the answer! The lens is fast, autofocus is lightning quick, it's cheap, and it's small and light. Images are sharper than any lens I've previously shot, the bokeh (out of focus backround) when shot wide-open is as good as I've seen, and lens flare is non-existent. That's right, and I've shot directly into halogen, floresent and the sun! For those who experience flare with this lens, I recommend taking off your useless UV filter. The front lens element is receded far enough that it is not at risk for bumps, smudges and cracks.[...]"
5,"sharp, clear, easy","I love this lens. It forces me to compose in the viewfinder instead of winding a zoom lens back and forth and then deciding that I can just ""fix"" it in post-production. Sometimes it's a little slow to focus if the background is close in color to the subject, but I can live with that. It has also forced me to deal with its speed, I've been telling people that it can ""almost see in the dark..."" It's speed created over exposure problems at the beginning since I've been using lenses at 1:4.5-5.6 all these years and it is an adjustment to go to 1:1.8, but in a very good way. I can slow the ISO down to 100 and 150 and take some very rich shots. It is inexpensive, lightweight and fast. What's not to like?"
5,Thank you!,I purchased this lens as a Christmas gift and my boyfriend was very happy with it. It was in great condition and came very quickly. Thank you for great service.
5,"Best optical quality you'll get for the money... and in some cases, even if you spend a lot more.","No matter what camera you have (assuming your camera has a focus motor, of course), you absolutely need to have this lens. The optical quality is absolutely staggering, incredibly sharp, perfect color reproduction... and it is just such a fun toy to play with. Sometimes people get thrown by not having zoom capabilities because of the fixed focal length, but don't let that throw you. Put it on your camera and don't take it off for at least a few months. Zoom with your legs. You'll be glad you did."
4,Great lens for day to day usage,"We were looking for a lens that would allow day to day pics with good quality. We bought this based one of our friends loving it. It does take getting used to (for the amateur like me) when you come from a lens that allows zooming. But the pics are great. We used it at a baptism and you get amazing shots. We use it on our D70s. The lens is small, light and perfect for day to day usages. I would recommend this lens as it is an excellent lens for the money it costs."
4,Great lens but I wish I had more uses for it,"This lens performs excellently. It takes great pictures and has incredible bokeh. I only wish I had more uses for it. It performs very well in low light and the f1.8 aperature is very bright. For the price it is incredible. I just have to say one thing about the man who wrote the review about the auto focus not working on his D60. The discription says that the lens works on Nikon SLRs NOT DSLRs. So Nikon is saying it works on all FILM SLRs not Digital SLRs; and all Nikon FILM SLRs have focus motors built in although many Nikon Digital SLRs (except the D60, D40, and D40x). So if you read the product discription more carefully, you wouldn't have had that problem. Anyways, Great lens and Highly recommended."
5,woweewoowoo,"Hey, this is a wonderful little lens.Crisp,clear and sharp. A really short depth of field at 1.8, the nose is in focus but the eyes are not kind of focus. Get this lens at this price,you will be glad and pleased with the photo clarity."
3,Not quite as sharp in my experience,"This is a very nice lens. More of a plastic feel but the speed, bokeh and depth of field are very good. However I have had significant issues with focus. Note that what i received is NOT an Auto Focus lens. That is not a problem, as I would have probably turned the AF off anyway. But I take photos that look beautiful in the viewfinder and on the LCD only to blow them up and encounter lack of focus at 1.8.If you want a 50MM prime and you are serious about having something that is consistently good and you can grow into, I would recommend you go with a 1.4 50MM instead."
4,You get what you pay for.,"To start, I just want to say that I really do like this lens. Next, I want make it clear that you get what you pay for. I jumped at this buy before I had the chance to really read the specs of this camera. I love how easy it is to use and how easily it attaches to my camera but it doesnt have ""auto focus"". I didnt realize how beneficial it was to ME and not so much my peers. I have astigmatism and the fact that it does NOT have auto focus leaves a big margin for unfocussed shots. Beside that, its a good lens. Probably the best available under 200 dollars."
4,Fun lens to experiment with,"I bought this as my first ""prime"" lens knowing it would be a maunual focus on my D60. With that said I cannot complain but it should be clear that the subject matter needs to be very still at the wider aperatures. I am very new to DSLRs but not so new to photography, I think I will make good use of this lens!Recently upgraded to a D300s and was pleasantly surprised to find the camera auto focus works with this lens (unlike the D60). Great results with night and low light shooting."
1,Don't use at all.,My Nikorr 18x105 I currently use all the time. Every time I've taken it off my D-90 and used the 50mm lens I regretted buying it. After using it a couple of times I've removed it from my camera bag and as of yet not missed it al all.
4,Would be cool if the D40 didn't suck.,"I usually shoot Canon, but due to many other reason I'm stuck with a Nikon D40 for now. I don't really know anything about Nikon, but I figured this would be a rad lens. The problem is that it won't auto focus on the D40. I know I know, I should have researched it more and learned about it, but really? Come on, who makes a camera this day and age that can't auto focus with certain lenses. Whatever, I'm returning it and getting the 35mm 1.8. I played it with it a bit and it had some really nice results. Amazon also got it to be super quick, overnight actually."
2,Disappointed,Lens was received promptly and well package. Unhappy to learn that auto focus unavailable with this lens and the Nikon D5000
3,If u have D40/D40x don't bother with this.,"I was mislead said manual focus will be easy with this lens, i was wrong, is much harder to focus in this lens using manual, i find easier to focus using manual with my zoom lens 55-200mm VR, even in focus i still often get bury picture, i don't recommended for d40 or d40x user, u should try it before you buy it. U lens kit is good enough no need this lense since only gave you 50mm, 1,8d is nice but little useless when is so hard to focus. Hopefully nikon will be coming out a motor build in prime lens for d40 and d40x in the future. Some shot does look sharp but is not worth the time to get it right, a VR Telephoto will do better in low light i compare to both. I was expect more from prime lens, i think downfault is probably frustrated manual focus."
2,Won't work on a D60,"I was disappointed to learn that the auto focus on this lens won't work with my Nikon D60. This info was not listed in the product overview, and I only learned this by reading the details in the manual after I bought the lens."
5,Great lense. AF doesn't work with Nikon DX cameras though. . .,"This is a great lense. I didn't realize that the AF doesn't work with Nikon cameras that need DX lenses (I have the D3000.) I still love this lense though, it was inexpensive and takes great pictures. I take a lot of pictures of food for my blog [..], and for that it is perfect. Taking pictures of my kids in motion is a little harder with the manual focus."
5,Just buy the lense,"Just get the lense, dont think about it so much... unless you want something more expensive, then you have other options... like the 1.4 and the other manual focus 50mm nikon lenses...But this one is really really good for $100"
5,Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 Lens is a MUST,"This is a very nice lens, it's very sharp, and it's very comfortable on the Nikon d40. However, you can't autofocus with it on this camera, which makes it a major bummer. However, i gave it a five star review because it can work on my old film camera, which is a plus. Plain and simple, it's a sharp lens you can not go wrong with. I own the Canon version of this lens, and in comparison the Nikkor version is much better, in build at least. You get a metal mount, and a better focusing ring. It's not the best lens in the world, but for the price it's Great, and a must for portrait photographer on a budget."
4,"Great little lens, Does NOT Autofocus with d5000","Excellent little lens. Price is great! Good depth of focus, easy to use, very quick. Good for low-light, indoor, and portraits. I really love it! One hangup is that it does NOT auto focus for my new d5000. Definitely not a deal breaker though for the price and the picture quality. Overall, very happy with it... Happy shooting!"
5,One Nifty little Fifty - it lives up to its name!,"I cannot say enough about this lens. It is lightning fast with the f1.8. The depth of field is incredible; it really adds a lot of creativity to your bag for a very modest cost.This lens is well-constructed and solid without being heavy. Whenever I am heading out and want to bring along my camera, I just mount this lens and leave the rest behind. Forget the laziness of a zoom lens and get into the experience!I have found that I enjoy shooting more with this lens than with the other lenses I have (which are nice lenses). It is truly one of those items you have to try to believe. It performs incredibly with my D80. I'm sure it is the same with all other Nikon bodies.If you're an amature or just getting into photography, invest in this lens; you will enjoy it so much and really get you excited about shooting.Good luck, and good shooting!"
4,Nikon lens,Great value for money. The quality of pictures are excellent. Only draw back is that there is no autofocus option. All in all a great buy...
4,great basic lens,"this was my frist lens when i got my D90... it is great in low light(obviously), the autofocus is very fasy and it is good for out door and indoor tight shots. can't take shots to close to your subject, and not ideal for turning your camera on yourself to try to take a self-shot... may just get your eye balls. but that is easily worked around with a tripod and wireless remote if self portaits is your thing. price is very reasonable, even with my other more expensive lenses.. i will still turn to this lens for certain shots because of the particular quality and feel to a photo it can produce. it is a very small lens, so it can seem pretty fragile... but treat it with respect, and you will get plenty of use from it."
4,Lens,"I bought this lens as an addition to a Nikon D3000 camera w/ 28-55 VR AF lens. I thought that it would also be AF after I checked the literature for the camera. I was wrong. It is not AF. Other than this, good quality (Nikon, of course!)anda nice addition to the set for close up work."
3,annoying purple flare in contrasty shots,"don't know if it's just my lens or this is characteristic of this lens in general, but when shooting into the light or photographing a subject against a blown-out background (which i do a lot) my lens produces a sizeable purple flare circle right in the middle of the frame. sometimes it is very distinct and can clearly be seen in camera when composing a shot, sometimes it is less pronounced and i discover it only on my computer screen, and sometimes it can only be detected by increasing the shot's exposure in, say, photoshop. this brings the purple out. very annoying drawback. i also have a Nikon 50mm f/1.4D AF Nikkor lens and i've never experienced anything like that with that lens. has anyone noticed purple flare in their contrasty shots? i'm curious."
5,Very good!,"This was my first purchase of my own from amazon. Very good lens.It's very light, I don't even want to use my other one (18-135mm) since this one is so tiny and cute.The only con would be that it doesn't zoom in or out, so all the photos appear to be extra close, otherwise 5+ product.Thank you Canon!!!:)"
3,Nikon lenses,"This product wasn't what I was looking for. I didn't get detailed information about it so... this is a high quality product, was received in perfect conditions on-time but unfortunatelly doesn't work with complete functionality with my D-5000 Nikon camera (focus must be make manually!)"
3,"Good Lens, No AF w/ D3000","Good Lens, good price, good packaging, on time delivery, BUT no Auto Focus w/ D3000 and nowhere is that stated except inside the box on the paperwork sent with the lens. ARG, this is the second time I have bought something from Amazon and not gotten what I expected to get based on what was available to see on the site. I'm gonna keep the lens but ...........Buyer Beware!"
3,good Len's!,First off let me start off by saying Do Not Go By The Stars I Rate This lens!I bought this lens and was happy with the build quality and pictures!. The only thing I did not Like was that it was only manual!!. So I got the AF right away and returned this one.
3,NOT compatible with D5100,"It is a great lens, but autofocus doesn't work with D5100. I think it should be very clear on the description of the product..."
3,Was too Tele for me,"I bought this lens to take photos of my 10 month old son with the D90. Which means indoor shots. I had to stand too far back. I ordered the Nikon 35mm F2.0 instead. It was alot better. If you are planning to use this indoor, I would suggest you look at the 35mm (unless you have a big house)."
4,Nikon 50mm f/1.8D,"Good as advertised. Shame on me for not reading all info before purchase, so note that auto-focus ""AF"" is not possible with the entry models such as the D40 (which I have) and D60. Those will need ""AF-S"" lenses to have a working auto-focus. I was sold on key words such as fast, sharp, low-light, and action, so I will have to work hard to feel satisfied in those terms because I will be manually focusing the lens. However, portraits look very promising!"
4,No Auto-Focus on the D3100,"This appears to be a good lens, but it will not auto-focus on a Nikon D3100. The product information should mention this, as many consumers (like myself) won't take the time to read reviews to find out the hard way that it won't work.I did use it a little with manual focusing and it did take very nice photos. However, my style of photography just won't allow for the time-consumption focusing manually will take. Back it went."
5,Good Value,"Good value. I had it for couple of months, so far so good.My friend bought the same lense and dropped it on carpeted floor, the fall broke the lense mount. It may be fragile."
5,Must-have lens for all photographers,"If you need a lens for low light condition, this lens will do a great job. It absorbs more light in faster shutter speeds due to the wide aperture (f1.8). This fast lens is also good for ""freezing time in a photograph"" (not blurry images) and for portraits. The depth of field control is unbelievably amazing! Don't think twice! Get this cheap yet powerful lens now!"
4,Overrated but still a good buy,"This lens draws raves from its fans, and while it isn't that good, it is still a good bang for the buck. 50mm for DX size sensors is an odd focal length. It isn't really a wide angle, but it is too short to be a tele. It is a little long for me as a ""normal"" lens. I use it mostly for low/available light shots indoors, but I find that I wish the field of view were a little larger.This is a lens that most Nikon DSLR owners have in their bag, and for good reason. It is well made, reasonably priced, and relatively small. Just don't make it your only lens."
5,excellent lens!,"excellent fixed lens. Works well on my nikon d50. Apperature range works great for all lighting conditions. If you are using a DSLR this lens ends up working like a 75mm lens so if you are looking for a straight up 50mm lens, make sure you buy a dedicated digital lens (DX lens for nikon users). All in all a fantastic lens for the money."
4,A must have,"One of the best lenses you could buy for $110. This is extremely fast and a gem in low light conditions. The pics are sharp and bright with great color, depth & contrast.However, keep in mind that that this is not a zoom lense and to get the best out of a prime lense, you would need work your feet. It's also a Chinese make and a plastic built. It's been an year since I've purchased this and it's giving me master pieces. I wouldn't mind the odds considering the price and the quality of the pictures.Highly recommend for anyone!"
4,"Good lens, slightly difficult to focus","This is a great lens for the money, although I find it difficult at times to focus and I often find that the pictures are slightly out of focus when I view them on my computer afterwords."
5,Best lens you'll ever use!,"Its the best lens you'll ever use. Its fast, light weight and the pictures are crisp/sharp. I use it for indoor portraits and street photography.Nikon makes this lens 50mm f/1.8 in both D and G versions. Upgrading to a G is pointless if you ask me all it does is make an already light weight lens even more lighter. An upgrade that makes sense if you are willing to spend the money is 50mm f/1.4"
5,"FAST lens, sharp images, don't let the price fool you","I'm not really a big fan of portrait pics or standard non-zooming lens, but that all changed when I bought it. For $110+, I got this lens in less than 2 days and I was impressed by the FAST autofocus on my Nikon D50. Great aperture range and nice 'bokeh' effect around F/1.8 and very impressive depth of field at F/22. The 'bokeh' effect can be a tad harsh at F/1.8 but if you tinker around with the f-stop, this lens can really make for some beautiful portrait/head shots with smooth 'bokeh' as backdrop. It does feel cheap and it feels like it'll break after 1 accidental drop, but other than that, it's worth the buy. For a non-ED lens, it definitely produces some really amazing pictures."
5,Great lens.,"I have quite a few Nikon lenses but this one may be my favorite. Lightweight and compact. Insanely sharp images. Very fast. Focus is the fastest of all my gear (and the sharpest). Nice bokeh. For the $ I don't think there is a better Nikon lens. Downside obviously is the fixed 50mm which isn't nearly as useful as having the 18-200 VR. Build quality isn't top shelf and it seems mostly plastic, but for the money I don't have any issues. If I have the time to set up a shot I find myself looking for a way to get this lens on the camera above all my others."
5,100% Satisfied,"Amazing lens, especially for the money! I am a professional artist and I do a lot of street photography. I have already used the lens with my D100 on several trips and couldn't be happier with the results."
5,Amazing,Not sure Howard Roffman can do any wrong. He just gets better and better. Kris is simply an amazing model and it comes through on every page.
4,detective,i have the whole series and it is pretty good i think the first was the best. the later episodes seem to get bogged down in personal relationships
3,"Nice movies, but ridiculously priced","Short and simple, the two George Gently movies are excellent. The Amazon.com $27.99 price for the two discs is much too high, and the $39.99 suggested retail price is insane. Another reviewer mentioned that the prior-released British edition had additional features that the U.S. edition lacks, and if that is true then it is inexcuseable and a further crime perpetrated by Acorn in the release of this set. Only the quality of the movies boosts my rating to 3 stars."
1,George Gently,I have purchased all series because we liked Judge John Deed (same actor) but requested to be returned because series are area restricted which means they cannot be viewed!
5,george gently,"I'M A NEWCOMER TO THIS SERIES AND ALL I CAN SAY IS, "" I LOVE GEORGE GENTLY.""BRING ON A NEW SERIES SO I CAN RAVE EVEN MORE!"
3,A B-24 Crew bails out over the Balkans.,"I read this old paperback since its sounded interesting. I am surprised it has not gone into a reprint. This true story is about a B-24 crew hit by ack-ack over Romania and forced to bail out over Yugoslavia. They land in an area controled by Chetniks. The Chetniks are allied to the Germans, since the Allies have linked up with the Patisans. This story is about their 9 month ordeal fleeing the Germans and Partisans. During part of that time, they assumed the identity of Chetniks and ate and slept at German camps. The last part of the book is about their evading capture by the Partisans.This is an interesting book. It shows the Americans and British may have made the wrong partner decision during WWII. Perhaps we should have allied ourselves with the Chetniks."
5,Good Read,I enjoyed this book. I read it over two days. A friend of the family was a B-24 tail gunner in WWII. I gave them the book and they really enjoyed it. That said a lot about the book to me because they had the real life experience of flying in B-24's and they enjoyed the book.
4,History made history.,"Absorbing, but needs to be read as part of the trilogy. Good historical research on India before the Partition by the British following the Raj."
3,Compaq presario R3000,"I bought this laptop in Nigeria and 3 days later I was back in Paris, France.To my Horror it did not have 512MB RAM but 384 MB RAM. Being a great fan of World of Warcraft in august 2005, I was obliged to buy a 1GB RAM combine it with the inbuilt memory to get a total of 1.12 GB of RAM.Then my next problem was the touchpad. for some unknown reason mine has been messing up. I used to use my wireless mouse just for games but now i use it for everything.This laptop is really heavy, and i cannot afford to drag to school like the really cute and light Apple laptops.And apart from the fact the laptop can overheat, it is important to check that you do not have a battery pack with a bar code label starting with GC, IA, L0 or L1. If you do please check the internet for more information, because these packs have been recalled by HP. (they have a tendency to overheat).Despite the above, I truly love my first laptop. ^^"
3,Good enough...until now,"R3270CA notebook PC (3200 amd64, 1 gig of ram)Good laptop until battery life became absolutely nothing shortly after a year of use. Laptop has also started using the fans too much in order to cool it down and crashes the odd time due to this.As I said, when its working the laptop has served its purpose for me, unfortunately the battery life and overheating problem would prompt me to discourage buying this laptop.good luck,TCB"
4,A good place to start,"Ok, so you're reading the Bible for the first time, and you've got questions. This book offers you some possible answers. Yes, other critics of this book have other answers... no one said all Christians or Bible scholars agree... but this book does make it simple for you to read what some of the answer may be. Which also allows you to see what fits or doesn't fit with your own understanding of what you're reading in the Bible. No one can say one book is totally right or totally wrong when it comes to making sense of the Bible in today's world... except God. And He's no here right now to right a book, so you'll have to read a few books on your own and come up with your own opinions. I think this book offers a good starting point, an easy style, and answers that do help the novice."
1,Sad and worthless,"This book helps nobody except the sad people who already have an embedded superstitian. The Bible is not the 'word of God' it is a record of the Jewish people over a period of a little more than 1,000 years. If you want to really get logical about the subject have a read of The Hiram Key or The Second Messiah by Knight and Lomas. They might not have it all correct but they do blow away some of the sillier things that people believe about the Bible."
2,Well Written Novel Left Me Horribly Sad,"Come on - How could life get worse? I kept thinking poor Hazel's life could only get better. All would be well in the end ... but no. The abyss she dropped into got worse and worse. Even her love for Black John was a source of nothing but sadness and degradation. It ended like ""Gone with the Wind,"" -- Black John's daughter vowing revenge. The book was so well written, earthy and well paced that I was sorry I could not find any joy in reading it. I don't mind some horrible scenes and sadness (it was 1546) but I wanted to scream at the total lack of happiness or hope. If you like feeling down and depressed, this is the one for you. I had to immediately read a regency novel to gain my needed happy ending. -- Reading is entertainment - if I want depressing stories, I can always read the newspaper."
4,"Does the job, son loves it","We got this for our 2 year old who adores Lightning McQueen. We have to travel quite far to visit his grandparents and wanted him to have something to make sleeping away from home easier. I wouldn't trust it for cold weather camping or any real heavy duty use, but it's perfect for what most people will probably do with it (i.e. kids sleeping over at friends and family). My son loves it and I feel like the price was reasonable."
3,OK slumber bags,My kids like these slumber bags because they have the CAR on them but the inside lining is rough and sticks to any rough skin you may have. One of my sons will not sleep inside the bag without something else between his skin and the lining. We have had ours for 1 year and a half now and they are holding up OK (have washed them and they didn't disintegrate in the washer) but we do not use them very much. I think it is a three star because it is not much worse than any of the slumber bags I have ever seen.
2,Details?,"Recently I read a few books on John von Neumann, I don't see myself as an expert, but I do have some knowledge. Therefore: You can tell a good book from a not so good one by checking, whether the details are right or not!"
4,Cool,"this is a VERY slow moving helicopter but that makes it easy to fly in our house. You can hover it for about 5 seconds but if you do it for to long, it will go backwards. I give it 3 and a half stars"
4,"Some greatness, some dated sounds","Corea on acoustic is superb. Stanley Clarke is on the top of his form. Gadd's snare sounds like a high-school marching band but his tom-tom and bass drum are very good. Some of the arrangements are timeless and could be done by a serious orchestra. Some are 70's stilted (El Bozo, for example). Listen to Spanish Fantasy."
1,Terrible disks,"These disks are not worth your time. Every one i've used from the spindle so far has given me trouble. The first one wouldn't format properly and couldn't rewrite, the second formatted but the recording quality was almost unwatchable since the rewrite, and on and on. I don't know why they suck, i just know that they do."
2,"Good for a while, but then all hell breaks loose.","These discs worked pretty well for a while, erasing and writing smoothly. However, after about 20 cycles, they completely fail. Now I'm given to understand that rewritable discs have a limited lifespan, but this is ridiculously short compared to other brands. As other people mentioned, they DO lock up your system once they're ""dead"". I had 2 of them die on me in the same day. Terrible product in the long run. What a shame, considering that they actually worked fine at first."
2,Not these for me,"Used these did not like them went later with Dvd-RW,those are the ones to use from Verbatim.Very pleased with their product not this one.Update:2012,Now i'm not so sure about the Verbatim,started giving me trouble.Things that i had recorded on DVD-RW all of a sudden i couldn't play back on my Sony Recorder which is my main unit,had to use an all-region player to view."
1,coasters,"bought these because i've had great success with fuji's dvd-r & dvd+r media (the ones made in jp). however, these will not even be recognized in my nec 3520a or nec 3520aw drive. this was very suprising since its a fuji and i made sure i got the ones made in jp. oh well, live and learn."
2,MGM + Steinbeck = Disaster,"Time has not been kind to ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942). Spencer Tracy, John Garfield and Hedy Lamarr are regrettably miscast in this disappointing adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1935 novel. However, Frank Morgan earned an Oscar nomination for his standout performance as the dog-loving hermit - the best aspect of director Victor Fleming's misguided comedy-drama. The Steinbeck realism is hopelessly lost amid the MGM gloss."
3,IT HAPPENED IN MONTEREY,"This simple Steinbeck story takes place in the Monterey, California of the early forties. A little slow and drawn-out, the story involves Tracy and Garfield and their paisano friends and their adventures. Garfield's inheritance of two houses bring him instant respectability yet estranges him from Tracy and his other pals. Both Tracy and Garfield vie for the affections of lovely Lamarr and become near-enemies in the process. An entertaining little picture which has Garfield unfortunately miscast as Danny (his Spanish accent was pretty unconvincing) and the part lacked the dynamism for which Garfield was famous for."
5,Tortilla Flat,"Thank you Amazon for your quick response..The DVD Tortilla Flat was great....it good to be able to get classics's now and then ,seeing Movie's that they bring out this day are so depressing.Thank YouJ.K-S"
1,NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND!,"This book is mainly about people who throw boomerangs as a sport. I was hoping thatit had more to do about boomerangs. It does have a chapter with pictures ofboomerangs as art.So don't buy this book if you only want to learn how to make boomerangs, or wanta history of them from different cultures."
2,Dubious quality,"I have a set of Wamsutta jersey sheets that I truly love, but these are crummy: they are relatively thin, and they pill like crazy. I've washed them more than a dozen times, and even used a sweater stone to take off some of the pilling, but they're still not nice to sleep on."

2,"Great cracker, but many were crumbled.","My only disappointment was with how my case of crackers arrived. Within each box, I would estimate that a third to half of the box was a mess of crumbled crackers. The crackers themselves are very good tasting."
5,ryvita,"love the product, unhappy with the expiration date on the product , very short expiration date, would like to be able to knwo expiration beford next purchase"
2,close expiration date,"Ryvita Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Sunflower Seeds & Oats, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10) I purchased this product in March 2009. When I checked the expiration, it expires in May 2009."
4,DIFFERENT EYES,"I will watch for books by William Phelps as I felt he had a real feeling for Bobbie Jo. So he didn't drag us all through gross details, I am grateful for that. I thought he wrote in a caring way remembering the family's feelings. For those who are just looking for excitement, you will be disappointed but if your looking for sincere and thoughtful considerations of the victim and her family it will be a good read of a horrific crime. You won't be disappointed."
5,Murder MOST Foul,"Once again, Phelps demonstrates remarkably that truth is stranger than fiction. The story of Lisa Montgomery's abduction of a newborn baby girl is both fascinating and disturbing. ""Murder in the Heartland"" is a hauntingly fantastic read for any true crime fan."
4,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"Although the subject matter, a horrific 2004 murder, is repelling, Phelps manages to skillfully craft an engaging tale that will please all fans of the true crime genre or anyone who enjoys an entertaining, thought provoking story."
2,Dysfunctional people find each other - story poorly told,"I live in the region so I heard this story before it hit the national and worldwide news, and of course rejoiced in baby Victoria's return to her father.Most of the people in the book sound like a train wreck in progress (and this includes Bobbie Jo Stinnett's family - her father lives 10 miles away and her grandfather gave her away at her wedding?) and the book is full of typos, glaring inaccuracies (Topeka is in Kansas, not Missouri; the tsunami killed 250,000 people, not 150,000; and I could go on) and did an editor EVER look at this before it went to press? In addition, one would think that even rural Skidmore, Missouri exists in the 21st century regardless of what the author might think.I would have given it a 1-star rating but the story desperately needed to be told, albeit not this way."
2,Publisher's Weekly is Right,"This book is just okay. Well reported, but the author is pedantic and really full of himself, the writing mundane. Just read his crimerant.com to understand what I'm talking about. The book really should be able to stand on its own, without all the editorializing from him about him. I've never met this guy, but I have the feeling that he walks around with his chest puffed way out. There's no way anyone should be comparing this book to a classic like ""In Cold Blood."""
2,A very disappointing book,"While the writing was much improved over the other Phelps book I read, Murder In The Heartland seemed like a disorganized rough draft that was rushed to the printer.The book was less about the crime, the victim, Bobbie Jo Stinnett, and the offender, Lisa Montgomery, than it was about Lisa Montgomery's relatives and their opinions.M. William Phelps, who calls himself ""Matt,"" claims to have researched the case for over a year. It is certainly not reflected in his book.I noticed several inaccuracies in the book and was quite disappointed in it."
3,"Great story, poorly told.","This is disappointing, because I feel like this is a juicy fascinating tragic story which has been rendered somewhat impotent by Phelps's flabby prose. More than anything, I think this book was lazily edited -- it doesn't flow well, it's repetitive, and there is an excess of off-topic editorializing about any number of things (9/11, Ashcroft, tsunamis) that adds nothing to THIS story. I never felt like I got a real handle on ANY of the characters: the victim's her husband was barely discussed -- surely he would be a compelling person to focus on. We meet someone who proves to be rather important 3/4s of the way through the book. Etc. The reviewer who said this seemed like a first rough draft was right on. As rough drafts go, it's excellent -- but it still needs work. Too bad, because it could have been really interesting."
2,"Too long, loses steam","Although I don't think that the author needed to wait until after Lisa's trial to publish a book, he should have ended this one after she was arrested. Not much happened with Lisa after that, other than that she became more religious in jail. The last third of the book seemed to be a repetitive detailing of Lisa and Carl Boman's marital troubles. We read about them kidnapping their kids back and forth, and following each other all over New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri, with a few trips to southern California to boot. It's pretty boring reading once Lisa is arrested."
4,great story told in every dimension,"Considering the trial hasn't even happened, the story's subject matter is meaty enough to suck you in. With the exception of a few laughable stereotypical descriptions of rural Missouri, it is well written and researched, but I must wonder why certain minor points are mind-numbingly beaten to the ground-- specifically the AMBER ALERT and Boman's role; not to diminish either, but these two points were annoyingly overtold. I hope Mr. Phelps will continue to follow the story and perhaps give an update in future (editions) printings."
3,Heartbroken Heartland!,"Skidmore, Missouri is a quiet midwestern town but it has more than their fair share of horror stories and crime like the vigilante murder of Ken McElroy in 1981 and of course, the brutal murder of very pregnant Bobbie Jo Stinnett in 2004. She was 8 months pregnant when her murderer, Lisa Montgomery posed as Darlene Fischer arrived to discuss puppies. All Lisa wanted was the baby girl that Bobbie Jo was expecting after Christmas in 2004. She strangled her enough to get her unconconsious and performed a c-section on Bobbie Jo who fought to get her baby from her murderer. Lisa kidnapped the baby girl and tried to convince everybody that she just had given birth to a newborn girl despite the fact that she was never pregnant at all but she tried to convince others that she would. The book is well-written but prematurely published while my copy has no pictures. Regardless, the author does do extensive research on Skidmore, Missouri."
2,snoozer,"I found the book to be very long & drawn out. As a matter of fact, I stopped reading it & started another book. Horrific story, yes, but I feel the author could have cut alot of ""filler"" out and the read would have been more enjoyable."
4,I know the person who did the crime,"I was in Leavenworth, Kansas (CCA) with Lisa Montgomery who was found guilty of this crime..I was one of her first roommates after they let her out of medical...she shared some of her story to me..of the two books I have read about her this one strays a bit where the other book..Baby Be mine said it very much like Lisa told me...still it is a good book"
1,"Trash, don't support this at all","If you don't mind a 2 pound mouse or only being able to sit 2 feet away from the receiver, this package is for you. I got it about 30 minutes ago and am so disgusted I'm returning it already."
1,Piece of junk,Worthless. Keyboard does not function and their so called customer service solution is for me to pay to send it to them and give them $5.95 to send me a replacement. Don't waste your money with these rip off artists.
2,Monkey Ass,"This was the first release from Noisebox on Cleopatra records, not the best release but there are two good songs on the whole disc.As a music fan I wouldn't suggest buying this unless you have some extra cash laying around, same for DJ's. There are two OK tracks on the disc but you won't find yourself giving them much time, both ""I Hate U"" and ""Monkey Ass"" are good to spin from time to time."
3,Exciting..but....,"Yet another gripping tale of combat by my favorite author. Once again, I was unable to put the book down once I started. But I did find the ending rather sudden and wondering what the heck had just happened...""They hunkered down at the alamo ready for the final assault..and they all lived happily ever after! "" I will be waiting anxiously for the Idaho story."
3,The military life,"I enjoyed this book for its insights into the military life. I have never been in the military and appreciated this aspect of the book. It gave me a real glimpse of the highly structured, vast world of the military, which the author presents as a kind of culture and universe all to itself. The novel was very good on that score.But I found it a bit lacking in the action department. I can't agree with reviewers that refer to this one as ""action-packed."" I recently finished ""Fortunes of War"" by Stephen Coontz. Now that one is action-packed. The soldiers in this book do a great deal of marching, and there is a great deal of excellent observations about leadership and soldiering, but action?Still, Mr. Coyle's descriptions of the enormous challenges a mega-organization like the U.S. Military face and deal with year in and year out are worth the price of admission. -Mykal Banta"
3,Has Anyone found the Missing Chapter?,"No question - Coyle is the dean of modern land warfare writers. His descriptions of small-unit maneuvers are so detailed you can feel the mud and snow squish under your boots. It's been so long since I've read his other books, I'd forgotten about whatever was alluded to, but I sure wish Coyle hadn't forgotten the chapter at the end of the book. Just when doom seems ineveitable the (mechanized) cavalry arrive! How? what happened? Not even an after the fact explanation as denouement! Did his editor make him do it? Did he need to meet a deadline and just shipped what he had? Too bad - everything up to that point was as good as infantry stories get."
4,A good book even if it is overly simplified.,I read this book(though no other of this author) and liked it alot. The situation and characters are real and lifelike.The author thoroughly demonstrates his knowledge of military thinking. Unfortunately at times he overstates the obvious in military tactics. Some passages which should be a few paragraphs take pages and vice versa.The author contrasts the conflict between people of different ethnicities by showing us the conflict between Dixon and Reider.
2,God's Children,"While normally adept at fleshing out military characters for even civilians to understand, this latest offering by Harold Coyle falls short. The characters are one-dimensional, and lack his former depth. The story almost feels ""un-Coyle"" in that it remains with one view-point throughout the story, and still fails to follow a clear, concise line. His former technical and tactical proficiency has also fallen by the wayside. As a serving sergeant in the Army, it is a dissapointment sometimes to see our profession mispoke of. Coyle has done a good job in the past of avoiding this, putting in much time and research. This feels as if he wrote it while on the run, for quick money. For a better, more in-depth read, try ""The Ten Thousand"". And let us hope he shakes his pursuers and is able to return to his former proficiency."
4,Mr. Coyle accurate snapshot of Peacekeeping operations.,"Although only a relatively short book, compare with prior efforts (The Ten Thousand, Trial by fire.) God's Children rings with the authenticity of modern peacekeeping operations in Eastern Europe. At the end, you too, will wonder how the hell we end up there in the middle of indian country as targets for both sides. Nevertheless, like prior commentaries, the introduction of Lt. Nathan Dixon is a pleasant surprise. However, Mr. Coyle, please give us the novel that will fill the story behind all the tantalizing tibits that you drop through the book. I am sure that it will be on the same caliber as your prior novels. I will recomend the study of this book by any newly minted officer, at least, the wise ones.Nanzy Kozak Rules!"
4,"Good, but not Coyle's best","Coyle has chosen to explore a small set of events, happening toa small number of people. He's done it very well, but it'snonetheless a small-scale book. I don't mean that you HAVE to have crashing galaxies, or World War III, but this book simply operates on a smaller scale than his earlier works. Not bad, but I didn't find it as gripping as his other books."
2,author's other works are better,"I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as his earlier books. Personally, While I could identify with both protagonists, I tired of their characters early on. The author's coverage of Reider's internal struggles (new second lieutenants are filled with self-doubt. . .shocker!!) went on. . .and on. . .and on. . .and on. Similarly, Nathan Dixon's character got old quickly(tho' a bit less quickly). Finally, the author did a poor job developing the characters of the enlisted men and NCOs.Lastly, unlike his other books I've read, there really was no ""tiering"" of the drama. In previous books, we would have been privy to the happenings at Fort Apache and we would've been with Seargeant Taylor when his Bradley Fighting Vehicles were attacked. This book, much like the soldiers of 3rd Platoon, rambled along in the fog (as I write this review, I wonder if that was the point).Bottom line: if you like military fiction, it is worth a checkout from public library."
5,"Great Book Great Story, Renee a long time reader",I again loved the story and the plot it follows the military almost exactly as the military is. Mr. Coyle does not gloss over the facts and he makes the experience of a platoon marching and maneuvering Army style true to form! His books convey the experience of combat as it really is not as we as humans would like it to be. He makes you feel and experience what the people of the book feel and think. This is something most authors can not do! Mr. Coyle has a winner here an other best seller as far as I am concerned! No one can pull me into a story as well as Mr. Coyle
4,it was a good book,"i liked it. it was worth reading and i would recomemnd it to fellow readers, famly and frerinds a good read"
4,Good,"Great controller, just never use it much because the PC I had didn't really work well with flight simulators, just not enough processing power."
1,Force did NOT work!,I received it and the force feedback did not work. I bought the latest Microsoft Flight Simulator X which has that feature...and that didn't work.
3,"Great, but candle handle too much use","I really enjoyed this stick. Great feel, buttons quite responsive and it was intuitive to use. However, I rated it a three because after bouts of long usage, the twist started to drift, and I couldn't recalibrate to fix it. I exchanged locally, and had the same problem, again after a lot of usage. (Okay, maybe I should be doing better things than playing so much) Highly recommended if you have a life and don't play for hours upon hours."
2,"Ok for beginners, but get the sidewinder if you're serious.","I recieved this joystick as a gift. I have more gripes about this joystick than anything else. The button layout seems like it's made for basketball players. The centering is awful, out of the box this thing couldn't stay centered, even with the dead zone set and everything zeroed out. Now it seems like whatever the stick is attached to inside the case is loose. I can wiggle the stick around with absolutely no resistance. My roomate has the $185 sidewinder and it is much better, it feels solid with no looseness. $185/$35. If you can afford the Sidewinder, it's your only choice. I'm saving up for it as we speak."
1,Another bad controller,"Same problem as everyone else...too much play in the center right out of the box. The motors are weak and the software does not help the joysticks HUGE dead spot.After a month of play, it was not usable anymore. Pull the joystick back and it thinks it's going foward. Even the new software Logitech put out didn't help...how about making it in the USA instead of China with it's very high tolerances?"
3,Decent with practise,"I've had this stick for nearly 9 mos, and used it very little at first, preferring my non-ff logitech stick because this one seemed too out of control. After getting bored with a certain game, I took up this stick as a challenge, and am pleased with the results.The FF is ok, nothing special, but once you have it set up with your comp and your game (this took quite a while and a lot of experimentation), I won't go back to non-ff. I actually get a feel for when my plane will stall, which is so necessary in flight sim games (been playing il2 FB). The on-stick throttle is pretty good and is not loose.My biggest problem with this product is that the center spring doesn't really center, and seems to be in the ++ section a bit (upper right), which sometimes causes my plane to roll or pitch forward.All in all, ok stick for the money. FF is great, but I'll be heading toward a better, more expensive stick after this."
1,Wouldn't Calibrate!,"I have a Logitch Mouseman wheel that I've been happy with since a I bought it three years ago so, it was with great anticipation that I bought the Logitech Wingman joystick. Imagine my disappointment when I couldn't get it to calibrate! The first step in the calibration process is totally nonintuitive. After a frustrating period, I finally finished the calibration process only to find that when I began the flight program the plane immediately took a huge roll to the left! Some of the reviewers reported frustrating experiences with tech support. I ran into the same situation. I got the calibration download but, it didn't help at all. In the long run I wasted a lot of valueable time. I wound up buying Microsoft's Sidewinder Precision 2 which installed easily, has programmable buttons and was well worth the extra ten bucks."
2,Not bad until it stops working correctly,"Stop working after 2 months, it became totaly limp. Not very precise while it worked. I would not buy another."
1,a dissapointed customer,"i bought this joystick a while ago and never used it much. at first i strictly used it for racing games so i never knew that it was broken. when i push foward it only regesters a little bit and when i put it back to its original position it thinks im pushing down and messes up my gameplay. it has no nutrel position, it dosent spring back to the right position and leans to the bottom. every time i plug in the FF it starts to violently shake foward and back, even during gameplay, but without it the nutrel position is even more indefinite. as for the stick itself, the palm rest on it tends to make you shift the weight of your hand to the right and taking the stick along with it.the problems with the FF and the controls might have been because of damage during shipping or someting like that, but it could happen to you. anyway, im not happy with this design, get a sidewinder."
2,Review,"It's too complicated. Jumps around the screen. The one I bought from Radio Shack does everything the Logitech does, and is more stable, for less money."
4,Full of Forcelike Goodness,"The predominant problem with force feedback sticks is that they don't have the lovely center snap that other sticks do. The jarring motion is nice, but even with the force center turned on, control can be loose at best. That said, of the FF sticks I've tried, this is the best. It's comfortable, durable, easy to configure. Good stuff."
2,Not bad while it lasted.,"When I first tried out the Logitech Wingman Joystick, it was great. Good control and feedback affects. However, six months later, the stick has lost its x/y axis and can not be recalibrated. So now I'm out looking for another joystick (as the shipping cost and hasstle are more than the replacement cost). In summary, not a bad joystick, but not very durable."
1,Save your money!,"After only about 2 months I found I couldn't get this supposedly NEW joystick to calibrate. After lots of frustration on the website (downloading updates) and NO response to emails, I am giving up! Guess I'll spend more money and go to Microsoft's!!Learn from my lesson .. save your money now and go elsewhere!"
5,Will NOT run under Windows NT,"This joystick will NOT run under Windows NT.It will run solely under Win 95 and Win 98. It comes with a CD that loads the drivers - but won't even install if have WinNT.The joystick is solid and has a GREAT feel (my cousin has it) - much better than the one I have. It run on a USB or regular game port, since it comes with dual connectors.A REALLY nice joystick...!!!"
1,JUNK,The first Wingman joystick I had [gave] out in about a year. I got this one new as a gift (!!!!!) and it lasted 3 months of 2-3 times per week use. ... Don't waste your money.
2,Great force feedback but horrible centering,"So I read a bunch of reviews on here and gave this stick a try for Microsoft Flight Sim 2004 [the only ""game"" I ""play""]. Installation was a breeze. The force feedback was excellent, and simulated well the forces on the control surfaces! I had a horrible time trying to get a little simulated Cessna to fly level for instance - the centering on the stick is terrible, even after playing around with sensitivities and the null zone galore. After 30 minutes of a short flight, my wrist was aching. Trying to keep pitch was pretty difficult too, especially while landing. I must add that I'm a southpaw, and using a right-handed stick was probably a bad idea to start with. I don't know if the experience would be different for right-handers. Anyway, I decided not to risk carpal-tunnel, and it's on its way back to Amazon."
2,Crash and Burn,"The design/ ergonomics are ok, but it feels cheaply made, and,when not playing in force feedback mode, it lacks the precise handling qualities of,say, a CH Fighterstick. Even worse, the Logitech's force feedback feature died about a year after purchase. I have recently purchased a Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 and I find that it is much more substantial."
3,"Not too bad, if you don't mind buying a new one every year","Joystick is not bad, force feedback is great when its new. Product does not wear very well, mine lasted 9 months. Great first time joystick, it would be great if Logitech would put some durability into their products."
5,A Unique and Enrapturing Memoir,"Of the many books I have read on this topic, this is by far the most interesting. The book is compiled of Gottleib's actual diaries, which makes it even more encapturing. To see such a young girl go through this kept me reading through in 2 days. I highly recommend this book!!"
1,11?!?!?,"Are you kidding me? Was this really Lori when she was 11? I'm 11, and I'm reading this book and this girl is so immature. She acts like a four year old or something. I've only just gotten to the part where she's at her aunt and uncles and wont eat, but she seems like the only reason she's not eating is because she doesn WANT too. As if she's just doing it to piss off her parents. Sure she throws in a couple ""Oh my thighs are so fat""'s, but really this book is more about growing up then being anorexic."
2,Would not read this twice...,"Honestly, I'm still struggling with my eating disorder I've had for 6 years, and for some reason I'm falling into a rough patch. So I picked this book up looking for some triggering material. I didn't really get anything out of it. Not even psychological explanations that normally come with a book on eating disorders. The book is cute, to say the most, and I would recommend it for seriously bored human beings. I wouldn't call it triggering really, so I might let my niece read it one day when she's old enough to understand the concept of an eating disorder, and when I know that she over the age of aquiring one. So I suppose this book is for the mature audience who has been through that part of her life. Very easy reading also."
5,"A Painful, Yet Readable, Book","When I read about this book in one of my Biography magazines, I immediately decided to buy it. This is because I am a fourteen-year-old (that's right, only eighth grade) girl who is a recovering anorexic. I am barely older than the main charecter herself, and so I could relate to her story entirely when I read it. I finished 'Stick Figure' in two teary hours, and by the end I had already developed a deep sense of admiration for Lori in so many ways. With a situation like hers, growing up in Beverly Hills, with a shallow airhead for a mother and insolent teenybopper friends, I think an eating disorder was almost inevitable. Yet, she fought it and emerged from it with a strength that has personally inspired me in my own situation. This book is a must read."
2,read Wasted instead,"it was entertaining, but not what i expected. i was so excited to buy it, then very disapointed. read Wasted instead."
2,Entertaining if not helpful,"I appreciate this book for the way it is written (it really is Gottlieb's childhood journal and she was a smart, funny kid) but I'm not sure it's a valuable account of anorexia. She felt pressure to be thin so she stopped eating. Then she realized it was wrong and started again. If this was really all there was to anorexia, if one could just decide logically to stop it, people wouldn't die of it. Just the same, there are worse ways to spend an evening than reading this. More interesting than her anorexia is her insight into how American women treat men like infants."
2,too superficial,"This book should be classified Young Adult reading, I don't think the writing would hold the average adult's interest. Could the author mention ANY more often how gifted and wonderful she was in her eyes? This was unusual, for a child who apparently thought highly of herself to create issues with food. Eating disorders are so complex and I felt the author came off as a rebellious brat who didn't really have an illness, just a power trip she was winning. It didn't seem that her thoughts/feelings around eating changed, it was like she said, ""Oh, okay... I'm bored with starving myself now."""
3,amusing yet quite disappointing,"I found this book very amusing, yet i agree with one of the prior commentors that it was a little too similar to Life-Size. Stick Figure was absolutely hilarious but at the same time very gripping and reasonably realistic. I read it while in a children's hospital (yes, a hospital for people under 20 years of age) and it was said to have 'disrupted my recovery' - as my eating disorders doctor put it(which i interprut as more of a sign of its strength). Nevertheless, Stick Figure was a well-written and original book; and i do recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject of anorexia but who is not quite willing to investigate its more chilling side (and someone who loves witty writing)."
5,"Powerfully Humorous, Sadly Real","Very moving! Thank you, for providing some insight to how EDs develope. It helped me understand what several of my friends are either going through or have gone through. I'm sure your book will help a lot of people. Not only is it an intense story, but the style is excellent. Great job, Lori!"
2,No emotion!,"This book was all facts and little emotion and feeling. She didn't explain the deep down feelings and the pain associated with anorexia. Very little depth into her treatment. It was an interesting book to read but if you're looking for honest and raw emotion read ""Wasted : A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia"" by Marya Hornbacher."
3,Unrealistic,"I have to tell you that this book is very unrealistic. While I was reading it, I kept thinking ""Yeah right,"" or ""As if that would actually happen,"" because honestly, the girl is eleven years old, and that is extremely young. I think if you want a true, harsh book on eating disorders, go with Wasted by Marya Hornbacher. It provides insightful, unbiased views on the disease, and is pragmatic."
1,Don't Bother!!!1,"Why our Catholic high school is making our kids read this book - that reinforces pathetic stereotypes of girls, bad relationships with their moms, uses dirty words and culminates with a trite rendition of - what else - a girl who handles her 'coming of age' not with strength, dignity and guts, but, alas, an eating disorder. Don't get me wrong - that's a real deal but to have our nations teens - nations girls - read this drivel is downright sad. They need MORE BOOKS ABOUT GIRLS WHO SHOW STRENGTH THRU ADOLESENCE, NOT THIS GARBAGE!!!"
2,This woman has not recovered,"Although this book has some nominal entertainment and educational value, it left me irritated and insulted. Ms. Gottlieb was an eleven year old crying out for affection and attention, but instead conveys her ""former self"" through her over-achievement as an eleven year old and her mother's inadequacies. Her tone comes across as arrogant and less than believable. This coupled with the seductively posed author photo on the book jacket leaves me wondering if Ms. Gottlieb 'gets it' when it comes to the fact that a woman/girls self-worth should not be wrapped up so closely with Sex-appeal."
2,Gloss over story,"The book is a dismissive attempt to address a very serious subject matter. One day, Lori decides to become anorexic, another day, she decides to eat again. Along the way, she verbally assaulted doctors, nutritionists, school counselors, friends and her family. The most offensive aspect of the book is this 11 year old's personality. I am sure there are many young adolescents that deal with serious eating disorders, hopefully they are not as mean spirited as Lori was. The author may like to believe she was ""persecuted"" because she liked math more than shopping, but this girl was ""left out"" and ""unpopular"" because she made it difficult to like her."
2,Almost a mockery.,"I have read many books on eating disorders. While I somewhat appreciated the lighter side of this book, as eating disorders are very serious issues, it almost seemed as though she was mocking people with eating disorders. That's just how it came across to me, and I'm not sure why. The story didn't seem to have a real ending- she shows no signs of complete recovery or destined to a life in hospitals. I feel like it was written just as a ""me too"" type of story- everyone wants credit for their own little story to share."
4,Sticking Your Figure,"When you were eleven years old were you worried about what your body looked like? Well in Stick Figure: A Diary of My Former Self, Lori Gottlieb was not until she saw the people around her including her mother and friends dieting so they would have ""girlish"" figures. But everyone, except Lori, thought her diet was a bad idea. Weighing just over a hundred pounds before her diet was their first clue. When she started eating practically nothing her parents took her to the doctors. The doctor then sent her to a Psychologist. Lori ended up being admitted into the hospital diagnosed with Anorexia. This novel tells the story of a young girls battle between life and death. I really enjoyed the book. It is an easy read, and it keeps you wondering what will happen next."
1,Please,There is no way in haydes this was really written by an 11 year old. It's so contrived it reeks.
1,"Trite, Surfacy, and a Bore","As a former anoretic I found the off-handed, immature approach to the disease insulting. It makes anoretics appear shallow, stupid, and sarcastically trivial. I absolutely could not relate to the experience of the author. Yes, she makes some stabs at dry humor throughout, but it only makes her careless treatment of the disease all the more distasteful. To truly relate to the heart of an anoretic, read Wasted by Marya Hornbacher."
2,Unrealistic Revaltion,"When Lori was first developing and going through her eating disorder it seemed extremely true to life. I myself have an eating disorder and I could relate to her denial and the control that EDs can have on your mind. However, although it happened to her, the way that she understands and changes her eating disorder is COMPLETELY out of the ordinary. I don't think I would recommend this book to an ED victim because I think that they would be waiting to see their ""skinny self"" in the mirror. For most ED patients, this never happens. Even after they get the ED under control they will never see themselves as this. Through treatment you learn to accept yourself regardless of how you look, but that never changes how it looks in the mirror. Lori was very lucky to be able to see the destruction she was doing to herself, but for most people, they will never see that image in the mirror. God Bless."
3,Meh,"I've read a lot of books about eating disorders and people with them, and this is one of my least favorites.While it does show how a young girl goes from complete innocence to being painfully aware of her body, and how damaging it is to be surrounded by women who constantly obsess over their own weight, it doesn't really delve any further than that. It doesn't get into the psychological factors or the treatment of eating disorders, and Lori seems to magically ""get over"" her problem.For someone between the ages of 10 and 14, it's probably a helpful though triggering book. However, for someone who has struggled with and come out of the other side of an eating disorder, it's less than incredible."
5,Stick Figure: A Diary of My Former Self,"The book I read is called Stick Figure: A Diary of My Former Self. Lori Gottlieb who is telling her own true story in the form of her childhood diary. This book is about the true horrors that come with anorexia and the pain it sets on your family and you. She really explains everything she was going through even things you might not want to know, but it just compels you to read more. Lori really is very good at putting everything together, that happened to her and recalling back all her images from when she was younger in her diary into the book. I really have to say I enjoyed this book and it really helped me learn that you are perfect the way you are and you shouldn't be influenced by others negative comments. That is why I have to give this book 5 stars."

5,"Adding another 5-star ""rec"" to read","Do give this book a read. Informative, emotionally rewarding, beautifully told story of father/daughter and mother/daughter relationships with love and forgiveness and wonderful humanity throughout. Was I looking for a book on Shanghai? No. Thanks to Amazon and Kindle I found this treasure, however."
5,Worthy of 10 Stars!,"If you can call crying through the last 60 pages, and jotting down each lovely Chinese phrase, loving a book -- I certainly did. Impossible to put down and beautifully written, I recommend this journey to everyone. You will not be sorry for having taken the time to read Bo Caldwell's amazing achievement."
3,The Distant Land ofMyFather,"Well written ""memoir"" - or author's idea of what life was like for some Americans in China in the nineteen thirties.Enjoyed descriptions of Shanghai, for I myself was born and grew up in Shanghai and could relate to the descriptions of the city."
5,Delivered as promised!,I am completely pleased. I ordered some books at a great price. They came as promised on time and in good order. I am a very happy customer.Thanks
2,Don't bother,"This book is poorly written and boring. Don't waste your time or money on it, unless you were born and raised in Shanghai, in which case you might find it mildly interesting."
3,A glimpse into another time,I liked the book generally. The writing was ok. The story was ok. What I really enjoyed was the glimpse into Shanghai during this period of time. Found it very interesting about the Chinese/Japanese and Americans living over there...and the decisions/transitions/life changes that happen because of war.
5,This book is a treasure,"This book is a treasure, a novel that transported me back in time. It is a vivid journey back to the distant land of the narrator's childhood, the city of Shanghai, her father's city which he could not bring himself to leave. The book is beautifully, historically accurate. I spent my early childhood in the Far East and have visited Shanghai. I recognized the sights, sounds, tastes, and allure of this magical city. But more than a journey through time and distance, this book is a journey within, to the depths of compassion and the narrator's own self-discovery. It holds a world of experience between its covers, blending human weakness and dignity, power and beauty. Reading this book is to follow the path with heart."
4,A Wonderful Read,"This novel is a wondeful read and it is by far one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The book is so well written and detailed that you can almost see and hear the sites and sounds of Shanghai as you read. Bo Caldwell does a fantastic job of portraying life in Shanghai prior to the invasion of the Japanese and also in presenting historical facts about the changes and hardships which this invasion brought upon the people living there. She does this in such a way, that you are able to learn a great deal about Shanghai and it's past and at the same time enjoy a well written and intricate story. Not only does this book deal with Japan's invasion of Shanghai, but it is also examines the relationship between a father and the daughter whom he abandons. I would highly recommend this book to anybody interested in Shanghai or anybody who simply wants to read a very interesting and well-written book."
4,riveting story,"The story is riveting, really transporting you to the time and place. I didn't feel the writing was extraordinary, but would describe it as ""fine"""
5,Distant land of my father.,Loved the info in book about life in China during the war & with the Communist takeover. The conditions were horrible. The book great.
4,"Easy to Read, Harder to Forget","I enjoyed the historical part of the story, it was almost like being there. The personal part of the story was harder to relate to, but once the daughter could understand her father's almost irrational love of China, she became able to see that sometimes the parents you wish for are not what you get. But that doesn't mean that they aren't doing the very best that they know how. Once a child has learned to see the humanity of her own parents, she can forgive their foibles and love them for what they are. It was an easy to read book, well-written and hard to put down."
5,"A child's love for a father, lost and found again","A wonderful coming of age story by Bo Caldwell who didn't grow up in Shanghai although her vivid descriptions would make you think she did. A historical account of the horrors of war by a writer who grew up in Los Angeles at least two generations after Japans invasion of China, but, written as if she felt the pain of the protagonist, herself. A well told story of the love and trust of a father and daughter and the breaks and bends of time. A worthy read."
4,Distant Land,It's amazing to me that people can read this story and call the the character descriptions flat. Any book that moves me requires my engagement and participation from personal experience to connect with the people in the story. And this did for me. Beautifully written and it will stay with me.
4,I enjoyed this book,Don't really want to give a detailed review - I hate spoilers that do that. I just enjoyed it. I cried (but I cry alot - lol). It seemed very real rather than fiction. That makes me realize how well written it was.
4,"I kept reading, but the style nagged me throughout","I echo other comments regarding an impersonal writing style. You do not feel drawn into the relatively stereotypical characters. I'd like to add that the author uses a cheap trick to establish historical details: laying on all the brand names of items the characters used: Pabst, Pepsodent, they went to Fosselman's, etc. I've read other historical fiction and this author's attempt at it struck me as lazy.The one big positive: I kept reading. The story kept moving me along, and stayed dramatic. Its broad sweep of time and space was interesting, particularly the three phases of Shanghai's early 20th century history."
4,A Very Good Book about an Important Time and Place,"Shanghai just before WWII was a fascinating place. Part of it was an international city. That part was an amazing outlet for people escaping persecution; and a trader's paradise. The Chinese residents, however, were treated as second class citizens in their own country and were engaged in two separate wars--a civil war in China and part of a World War with Japan. Into this fascinating place Bo Caldwell inserts a little girl and her father. The interplay between their lives and desires and the world's turmoil makes this book fascinating on two levels, as an exposition of history and of the ordinary lives moving through it. A very interesting read."
5,amazing,"i got this book as one of the daily deals, and it is probably one of the best i have read this year. story flowed eloquently, beautifully, and there were so many emotions to process i literally could not put it down. it even got me a little teary towards the end. i would recommend this to just about anyone. great book!"
5,In-depth Interviews with Rare Factory Development Photos,"""CHEVROLET 1955 CREATING THE ORIGINAL"" by Michael Lamm is full of information about the development of the 1955 Chevy and its revolutionary V8 engine. He interviewed many of the people that designed and engineered the 1955 (some interviews were done many years ago). Also in the book are MANY factory photos, including an incredible number of shots of the handmade wooden mock-up of the car from the firewall forward, a mock-up used to fit parts as they came into production to assure they all worked together in the engine bay. There are lots more development photos of just about every aspect of the car. It's a must-read for all 55-57 enthusiasts."
5,A practical guide for new parents on a budget.,"I am a 69 year old grandmother who would have greatly appreciated this book when I was raising my children. After reading the book I gave a copy to my daughter who has two small children. Pointing out the importance of the safety aspect of baby products without leading parents to spent beyond their budget should be high on the priority list for new parents. This book is a common sense, easy to read book covering most aspects of raising a baby."
3,OK,It is washable and reusable but could not tell any differance between performance on my truck. price was great.
5,ONE OF STRONGEST SMALL PRESS BOOKS OF ERA,"It's like Harry Crews said in his BURIED ALIVE documentary, if you write, some people are going to have problems with what you have to say. I recall that this was the case for this writer when the book was first published.When I read CAFES OF CHILDHOOD, I was caught up in the drama and the powerful but spare use of language. I did not read the book as an indictment of the poet's family. He could just as easily have been writing in a persona. Poetry doesn't have to be factually accurate anyway, just moving and memorable. This book is both, and it is a surprise to me that Macioci has not pubished another."
5,rivals much more expensive lenses . . .,"Nikon's 300mm f/4 ED-IF AF-S telephoto lens is a excellent value and an excellent choice for shooting Sports, wildlife and portraits. At 3.17 lbs., it is very mobile and easy to hand hold. With extra low dispersion ""ED"" glass and fast, silent internal focusing, it is capable of producing photos that rival much more expensive lenses. When coupled with teleconverters, focus is not as sure and some shots may be missed while autofocus is hunting for the subject. For those needing additional range, after November 2007 Nikon will be introducing three new fast autofocus vibration reduction ""VR II"" super telephoto lenses:AF-S 600mm f/4G ED VR, AF-S 500mm f/4G ED VR and AF-S 400mm f/2.8G ED VR."
4,Great but can use an update,"I got this lens to supplement my Nikkor 70-200 f/2.8 VR lens for daytime outdoor sports. The lens is sharp and a bargain and should be in your bag if you shoot distant subjects. Used with the Nikkor TC-14E II (1.4x) Teleconverter AF-S, there is no loss of sharpness which pleasantly surprised me. The only issue is the open area at the mount which could possibly allow dust into the aperture area. With the TC-14E II mounted on the lens, the issue vanishes. The f/2.8 version is something like four times the price of this gem, so it is certainly worth the bucks. VR would help when this oldish D lens is updated, but it would make it heavier and not as easy to use hand held. I do use it mostly with a tripod or monopod."
5,love it,This is a great product. It came faster than I expected and I am amazed with the quality of the product.
2,"tasty but dry, and the seeds aren't kidding","These bars had a pleasant granola-bar-type flavor, and the varieties were very true to their names.The texture is light and crispy.The tiny hard flecks of what I presume are hemp can make the eating experience somewhat tedious. These small bits are entirely edible but are harder than anything else I consider food."
3,Over looking the obvious,"While I have for the most part been enjoying the Robin Paige mysteries, I find this one has a plot point (or is it a twist?) that really drove me nuts. Why was the dog able to track where the first murder actually took place but when it came to finding a kidnapped child NO ONE thought to have the dog try. After all, it was the dog's ""person"" that went missing. Guess Kate and Sir Charles aren't quite as clever as they have been made out to be if neither one thought of that. But I guess if the child had been found sooner the story would have ended much too soon."
5,Love it!,"Great compilation imo. Some really good tracks on here and a good mix of the artists on it. I bought it because it had Leaether Strip on it which i was familiar with and wanted more of the similar sound and got exactly that! I love the X-Marks the Pedwalk and Mentallo & The Fixer tracks too. This CD is a definite ""gem"" as far as compilations go. I would never sell my copy, that's for sure. All my friends want to borrow mine i say ""shoo!"""
3,Could be better,"I am an accounting major, but I think that finance is just as important in business and that is why I am taking a finance course. This book is pretty good for starters like myself, but the author should have more work problems to fine tune the skills needed to really grasp the concepts. I also feel that a student workbook would greatly help. The website for this book is also extremely limited and does not provide any additional help for people that purchase this book. I would not feel comfortable recommending this book to anyone wanting to get a basic knowledge of finance."
5,Good book,"Almost new very cheap under 1$, quick delivery, this book is very useful for learning investment, for beginners and very practical book"
3,Nice Toy,Bought for my wife going to Iraq. Ear pieces a little large but managable. Came with 256MB. (whoo hoo!). Plays well and fits all sizes of faces comfortably.
1,A Monsterous Failure,Ray Ferry is at it again. The book has no insite and gives nothing new to the fans. It rehashes material produced for years.
3,Only usable when very (or totally) dark,"I got this so I could have a flashlight on my person without resorting to a bulkier model, but I think I'm going to have to. This light, due to its size, can only put out so much light, so it's really only helped me, say, in a movie theater when I've dropped something and need to find it. It's not a bad light at all as long as you're aware that its uses are very limited."
2,Get's Boring Pretty Quickly,"The jacket drew me in...first time I've read one of Jane Heller's books. Chapter 1 kept my interest, Chapter 2 I started to lose interest, and by Chapter 5 - I was wondering if it was ever going to get better. It didn't. I read it...but was disappointed.First of all, this female character isn't very intelligent. The main male charater is totally unrealistic. No Fortune 500 CEO would waste the time of day doing what this guy did...... It was totally unbelievable. It was suppose to poke fun...but I just didn't get it and thus didn't find any of it amusing at all. Oh yea, except for Chapter 1............. I probably won't read any more Jane Heller's."
3,Fun reading,I just finished this book and I thought it was a fun read. The characters are believable and the story was interesting.
2,Predictible and boring,"This book is neither funny nor good reading. An intelligent female can see right through this predictible plot and not-so mysterious mystery. The premise is that someone has done Dr. Lynn Wyman, an intelligent female, wrong. I found it totally unbelievable that this character would not immediately suspect one of her close friends as her saboteur. And by the time in the book she figured out it was one of them, I was so disgusted with the weak plot, that I just didn't care to find out which friend it was. I took this book on a trip, and found myself reading the catalogs on the plane instead. If you are an intelligent person, don't bother with this one."
2,Where's the Intelligence?,"Now, I'm not an elitist, I love books like ""Briget Jones' Diary"", and ""Amanda's Wedding"" (Highly recomended); but this book was terrible. It's not only the frivolous nature or the impracticality of the book that made it so bad; but characters were flat and shallow, the plot was innane and predictable, and the events that took place would never happen. This book was so disappointing. The ""two stars"" are for the fact that it is not the worse book in the world, and some parts are funny, and- who knows? you might even like it; even though it's mostly bad. It started off ""okay"", so I stuck it through the end- but I still didn't like it. I have to strongly emphasize, if you are thinking of buying this book- DO NOT."
2,By far her worst,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Heller, but I don't know what she was thinking when she wrote this book. It was by far her worst, and it may even be one of the worst books I've ever read.The main character, Lynn, was just a total nitwit. For someone who was supposed to be such an expert in language and communications, it was totally unbelievable to me that she could be that naive and stupid. And the character of Brandon was close on her heels in the unbelievability department.The supporting cast, the premise, everything...just stunk. The only thing that kept me from giving this book 1 star was my respect for Ms. Heller's previous work."
2,What a disappointment,"I took this book out of the library as it had a catchy title and I had read good reviews of other books written by Jane Heller. If this is indicative of her work, I will not be reading more titles by this author. Although the book started off promising, as soon as Lynn becomes involved with Brandon (about one third of the way through) it goes completely down hill. Although Lynn is supposed to be this brillant PhD, she is incredibly stupid as the reader can see the plot turns coming a mile away. I had to force myself to finish this book. The only reason I did not give it one star is because I enjoyed the beginning."
2,Didn't love it,I didn't care for this Jane Heller book. I found the dialogue stilted and the plot a parody - just not based enough in reality for my taste. And I would never want a guy who went through the Wyman Method - yuck!
1,Horrible!,"Terrible, unbelievable dialogue. Example, from a woman: ""Between work and the kids, I barely have time to take a crap."" This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read."
3,Female Intelligence: Vacation Companion,"Female Intelligence would be a great commuter flight or poolside companion: engaging, entertaining, but predictable and not too deep. Heller's writing style allows her heroine to interact with the reader. The chatty prose sparks a sense of intimacy between book and audience, as if Lynn Wyman, the narrator, is sharing her story over cocktails at happy hour. And poking fun at male-female stereotypes always amuses. But the sketchy secondary character development leaves something to be desired in the whodunnit angle of the plot line. Breezing through this cute romance between a self-righteous but likeable heroine and her tamed brute was an energizing vacation from heavy lit."
4,"Now, see....I liked it.","I've read several of Heller's books and have enjoyed all of them. FEMALE INTELLIGENCE was no exception. Brandon Brock's initial behavior rang true, as I've known those in management positions who have exhibited the same attitude toward women in the workplace. Only, they weren't as lucky to get a Dr. Lynn Wyman to help them out.Heller presents a wealth of secondary characters, all unique in their quirks and foibles and I thought she did a good job (read= authentic) with Dr. Wyman's musings and opinions regarding these secondary characters. They all acted within character making them believable.The book evoked a range of emotions: humor, disgust, sympathy and shock. I would have liked it, though, if Lynn had come down harder on Kip and Penny. For what they did to her, they deserved, at least, a verbal lashing. In the end, Lynn triumphs, professionally and personally, which is the best revenge of all."
1,Still hopeful ......,I have read all of Jane Heller's books. I loved Cha Cha Cha and hope that Ms. Heller's next book is more along the lines of that title. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in her latest novel as it was extremely thin. More of a romance novel then general fiction. I do enjoy Ms. Heller's style of writing which is what got me through this book. The reader never had a chance to really get into any of the characters. I did develop a better understanding of men though! I still look forward to her next book but hope there is more to it than this title.
5,super read,"I have read all of Ms. Heller's books and I am a big fan, so I was thrilled when I saw she had a new one. Well...I just finished it and believe me when I tell you, you have to read this book. I spent the whole weekend reading it, and I laughed out loud so many times, my family quit asking what I was laughing at. I can't wait another year or two for her next one, so I guess I'll have to go back and reread some of her earlier books. Do yourself a favor, read this book and enjoy."
2,Disappointing,"I was drawn to this book because of the great things I heard about the book/author and the humor of the plot. Boy was I dissappointed. I kept waiting for the laughs to start and only found one line that delivered. Although teaching men to communicate with women was a great concept for a book, I found the character teaching men to say things like ""Gee ___, I don't know about you but I don't how I'm going to keep that mousse I ate last night from going right to my thighs"". If my husband ever said that I'd have his head checked. If you want laughs, read the awesome Janet Evanovich, Mr. Perfect by Linda Howard or Anne George."
4,enjoyed every page,"A few years ago I read Heller's The Club and loved it. Then I somehow forgot her and was reminded by a friend who'd just reviewed this title for amazon. This book is a really fun read, and it makes some good points without being preachy--i.e., that both men and women have a lot of the same faults and both can change for the better if they want to. I particularly enjoyed the major characters. Personally, I'd go out with Brandon Brock in a New York minute, even before his sensitivity training. He could call me Honey at a Yankees game too. I'm going to start looking at the other Jane Heller books I've been missinng."
4,Laugh out loud funny!!,"this is the first book i've read by jane heller, but it won't be the last! i logged on to find out what other books heller's written, because if they're half as good as this one, i've gotta pick it up. the main characters are funny, interesting and very individual but not in a fake kind of way. you typically see that kind of character development in a drama or something, but this book is right on. don't get me wrong though - this book is VERY VERY funny."
5,Hopeful Romantic,"This was my first Jane Heller Book. I was totally impressed with her wit and abiity to laugh at women as a species. I readily enjoy an author with a genuine sense of humor. Romance and comedy, that combimation is hard to beat. I also enjoyed the secondary story of the relationship between the women. The only other thing I would have added, would be a little more romance and development of the relationship between the main characters. I look forward to reading her other works."
2,Not worth it -- especially in hardcover.,"I read this for a book group, because we wanted something lighter than the recent ""downer"" books we ha've been reading. This was a little too light. You could spot plot developments a mile away. Dialogue was fake. Maybe as a paperback...at the airport...when I have spare change in my pocket and will read just about ANYTHING..."
1,Female (NON)Intelligence,"Truly one of the worst, most predictable, pieces of pap I've ever read. Perhaps her other books were clever, but I honestly can't find a single compliment, however reaching, to pay this piece of junk. Kept feeling as if I'd seen this TV movie about 15 or 20 years ago. Certainly read more like a failed screenplay than a novel,with its cliche dialogue and rudimentary narrative. I'm sure Ms Heller is a lovely woman, and as my mother would probably say, she'd probably read this review and laugh all the way to the bank. It was a clever premise fully unrealized."
5,I agree... ...,"This is the first time I've ever written a review but ater I finished Female Intelligence, I just had to! This book was hilarious! I couldn't believe how hard I laughed at some parts. It was very unlike me to crack up out loud, but I just couldn't help it. The observations Jane Heller makes about the way men speak are so dead-on, and Brandon Brock is such a likeable character despite how ""macho"" he seems at first. .... This book is definitely 5 stars, and now I'm going out to read the rest of Jane Heller's books!"
4,wonderful fun,"I bought this book to read during a long flight, and didn't expect much from it. I was very pleasantly surprised - the writing is witty and clever, and the characters likeable. An enjoyable combination of a romance and mystery novel. This is my first Heller book, and I will certainly read her others."
3,mp3 player,"The small size is great and the features are wonderfull. The FM transmitter picks up stations better than any other receiver I have had. I use it mainly for running and love it. One draw back is that the joy stick for the controls isn't well designed. If you are not careful, it will break off. The one I own is my second one because of the joy stick breaking on the first. I've had the second one for about eight months and the volume control doesn't work anymore."
5,""" REALLY GUARANTEED TO SMILE ""","DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT . I PICKED THIS BOOK UP AT A SWAP AND IT WAS THE BEST MONEY I NEVER SPENT . THIS BOOK IS SO TONGUE-IN-CHEEK AND AT TIMES LAUGH OUT LOUD IT DESERVES 5 STARS . I WON'T SPOIL IT BY GOING ON & ON AS SOME REVIEWERS. HOWEVER, JUST KNOW, IT'S KIND OF A "" FISH OUT OF WATER "" REAL LIFE STORY OF CITY DWELLERS MOVE TO THE COUNTRY ! STORIES WHICH ARE ALWAYS FUNNY . SO IF YOU CAN'T BUY IT, THEN AT LEAST GO TO YOUR LIBRARY AND TRY TO GET IT . SO WORTH YOUR WHILE . NOT AS TWISTED AND LAUGH OUT LOUD AS THE DAVID SEDARIS BOOK OF "" ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY "" , BUT, THIS BOOK IS FUNNY WITHOUT BEING OFFENSIVE . VERY ENTERTAINING. IT WILL FIND A PERMANENT PLACE ON MY SHELVES TO LOAN TO FRIENDS ."
4,Very good transaction,The 4 Port PCI High Speed USB 2.0 Adapter Card arrived in good time and it solved my problem. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,It doesnt work on mac like they said,"I tried in 3 different macs and it doesnt work. Try another brand with a bigger name, more expensive but it gonna work for sure."
3,Not for Mac OS 9,"The manufacturer claims on the box that this card is compatible with Mac OS 8.6 and up, but the instructions inside specify OS X, and no driver is provided for earlier systems. Also, with OS 9 on a Power Mac G4 MDD, it prevented my computer from going to sleep completely and prevented it entirely from waking up."
3,Super Reader,"I read this before I ever managed to find Dave Stevens' original comic version, so this may have influenced what I thought of that, originally. A tale of a young man, a rocket pack, a voluptuous girlfriend, a good-hearted mentor, nazis, mobsters and a crazy rich guy.Throw in lots of aerial antics and flying around, and you have a fun pulp adventure."
4,Steers Good,"Great and heavy feel of the steering wheel, I used to have the nascar racing wheel and it costs over 160USD. I couldn't find much difference between them. Go for it if I were u."
1,I'm Returning It,"After trying some PC racing games with a joystick, I thought I should move up to a wheel, to improve the experience. Well the Formula GP was not an improvement. When initially plugged in, it does not stay centered, and when used in a game, the vehicle changes direction without touching the wheel. I turned down the sensitivity, but then I could not make some turns even with the wheel at full lock. I am going to try a digital wheel (USB) instead to see if that provides a better solution."
2,Frustrating Controller,"The wheel worked great for me, but I am always using it so, after 5 or 6 months, the flimsy gas pedal snapped into two pieces. The wheel feels comfortable and is easy to use. The paddle-shifters work great and have very quick response. I have gotten a problem with it within the last 6 months where when you turn it left, it goes left, then right, then left/right/left/right. I tried calibrating it with the included software but it was no help. I did it in the control panel but it still didn't help. If you get one of these bad boys used, your taking your chances."
3,Where's the games?,"Well I think this is a good steering wheel. Our problem is finding the computer software that suits it. We just don't play enough computer games that are best played with a steering wheel. In our family, the joystick seems to be the preferred choice for game controllers."
3,One man's journey thru the Red China of the 1980s.,"This is a rather dated book about Thubron's journey through the Red China of the 1980s. The Wall he is referring to is the Great Wall and he visits both ends of it and meanders around this vast country. As a travel experience, Thubron treats his travel experiences by jumping around. First he tries to describe the countryside, with some flourishing descriptions and this tends to confuse the reader. Perhaps he is writing this for a British audience, but those of us on the other side of the Atlantic have a hard time digesting some of his wordings. He jumps from one experience to the next, so the flow of his writing is rather jolting. Some of his experiences make for good stories, but for the reader to mine this, he is in for an uneven read.This is an average read because of the flow of the book. For those interested in Red China, this may be of interest. For those interested in travel, there are better travel books out there."
4,Monk - Why say more?,"If you love Monk, this is more of the same. The only disappointment in this season is that Randy Disher's character is exceedingly goofy to the point of being unbelievable. This was brought into check in the excellent final season."
5,Cannot Wait,"I am a long time fan of the Monk series and cannot wait until the release of the seventh season. I have the others and they are great! If you are a Monk fan, season 7 is a must. If you have never seen the show and love a good laugh, check this one out."
1,Monk:season seven,"We have not received this item...we tried to contact the distributor, but they have not responded to our inquiries. I will not order from them again!!!!"
1,WORST SHOW EVER MADE!!!,It's soooooooo anoying and awful. Watching monk literaly makes me wona throw up. IT'S JUST SOOOO BAD. The only thing worse then the acters is the whole premise. I realy cant wait till they take it of the air its hands down the worst show in the history of tv and thats an understatement. I can not put into words how much I dislike this show. AWFUL TAKE IT OFF THE AIR PLEASE!!! PUT ON CI SVU ANYTHING BUT MONK!!!!!
4,"no great mysteries, but addictive","I bought this because I heard so much about the show. It is a clever premise--an OCD detective--and the acting is fine. I like how some actors know they are in a ridiculous scene but give their best. The mysteries are too easy--being an old Rex Stout/Nero Wolfe fan, I may be bias on that score, but the guilty one is easy to spot. However, it is rather addictive to watch how Monk figures it out without really touching anything. I also enjoy the interaction with the characters, though the cops are treated a little too stupidly for my taste (a little respect for police intelligence would add value to the show). All in all, it is a fun show to relax by and enjoy with younger members of the family."
4,Magic,"As always from season one, Monk has set a standard of sheer enjoyment. Season seven is as usual a gem, so much entertaining on 4 disks is hard to believe. More Monk, bring it on!!! (Please)"
5,"EXCELLENT ""Light & Easy"" READ","I loved this book...but I may be a little prejudiced, cuz I love Larry Hagman! I was lucky enough to have met him when he autographed my copy. I must say, he's very personable, not one bit stuck-up. He also signed my 1980's can of JR Beer and couldn't believe someone still had a full JR Beer from the 80's!!! A real genuine kind of guy...which I imagine is a little rare of such a long-time celebrity. I only regret his wife, Maj wasn't there...I'd have loved to meet her too. She must be SOME LADY to have put up with Larry all these 45+ years! If you want a good, funny, light-hearted read about some of Larry's antics thru his life, this is the book for you! My only negative about the book? I wish it had been longer...I couldn't put it down and finished it in two bedtime reads. THUMBS UP!"
5,Larry You are already way missed!,"A delightful and fast reading book about one of the most beloved characters (J.R. Ewing) and the family man Larry Hagman. I hung on every word & enjoyed reading about Larry's accomplishments , determination and all the fun he had during his too short life."
5,"Thanks for the smile, ""J.R""","It's not too often you read an Autobio that allows you to both learn something and be ""enlightened"". After reading this, I felt my heart smile. It's hard to explain, but I gained a bit more respect for the ""old school"" actors after reading this. It's a great read!"
3,Good Book,Enjoyed reading this book. He was quite a man. Why more words? It only takes a few to say I liked the book!
3,A trippy life,"Larry Hagman tells everything about himself . . . He runs unsparingly through a life of hedonism and pleasure, made extraordinary by the heaps of publicity he garnered by playing the Major on ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and JR on ""Dallas,"" both popular TV shows. Outside of these coups, his career never amounted to much, and he gives little information on what makes an actor tick. I was surprised about just how much of a drunk and drug-abuser he was, but Hagman happily makes it all seem like fun, and he doesn't employ the moralistic tone taken by so many other reformed drunks. I enjoyed this book and yet I wound up wanting to read another book, the intertwined lives of Mary Martin, Richard Halliday and Janet Gaynor. You get just enough allusion to their troubles from this book to leave you wanting more. All in all, a fun read from a forgettable TV clown."
2,Not What I hoped For,"I have always been a Larry Hagman fan because I have loved ""I Dream of Jeannie"" since I was a little girl. In this bood he hardly talks about it at all. Also, the writing isnt that great."
4,Sleeper Hit,"I found this book quite by accident and enjoyed it a great deal. I'm surprised that this book did not get more play in the media. It is honest to the core and gives a candid insight into the man who played JR and Major Nelson. The best parts of the book deal not with acting but with Hagman's relationship with his mother. It is truly moving to read. I also found it interesting how fond of and close he ramains with Dallas co-star Linda Gray (Sue Ellen). Evidently his mother loved her just as much. When the great actress Mary Martin died, Hagman had a photo of Gray placed inside his mother's casket."
5,Excellent Story about an Excellent Man,I loved this book... It was true and honest and a joy and a pleasure to read made me love Larry Hagman more than just as J.R. Ewing and as Jeanie's master... It was awesome it made me feel good to learn what all he has done and how he is doing I am sure he will be great however long he is still alive.. I love him... He is a great actor and a great person.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!,"They sent me an expensive, broken prodeuct, and would not refund my money!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!!"
4,Helpful tool,"This book is a helpful review of many articles from various literary sources. It is clear to see why mentoring is so beneficial when you read these chapters. This helps re-affirm the importance of your position as a mentor, and what you can/should expect as a mentee."
3,The Young Bandit!!!!!,"If this had been dropped right after Cube's War album, it would be tight, but people have forgotten about Khop. I think that the label killed his career. ""Da Ready ROck"" showcases his skills as well as ""Khop And Da Brain."" I also like the joints with Kurupt and Dub C. If you really like West Coast hip hop that showcases real talent, get this album. The obnly place that the album falls short is the production."
4,"Nice sheets!, but not colorfast","They're sharp-looking sheets - colorful enough for me and masculine enough for my husband. The only thing I didn't expect is that it doesn't have the same pattern on both sides. Fully printed in rich color on one side, and whitish on the other side (although you can see the print through it, sort of). After a few washes, though, the colors fade fast."
3,"Where's ""Money From Home"" ??","I agree with the other postings - when will Money From Home be released on DVD? The best I've been able to do is buy a copy (pirated, probably) on VHS from eBay."
3,Bought the collection to get ONE movie,"Our family has loved ""Artists and Models"" for years, and have watched for this movie to be released. So far, the only method of legally obtaining a copy was to buy this collection. Of all the movies included, Artists and Models is by far the best. It's worth buying the collection merely for the ""bathtub scene"" with Jerry and Dean, and the ""stairway scene"" with Jerry and Shirley MacLaine, and we particularly love ""Mr. Murdock"" and his high-functioning office. If you are a Jerry Lewis fan, Artists and Models is certainly going to be enjoyable for you.I do wish they'd released Artists and Models separately, though.BDM from the Deep South"
1,Way Too Much,"I've been trying to find Hollywood or Bust, on DVD, alone-not a 'collection' for awhile now. I'd buy this collection if it was reasonabily priced.It's clear to see that whoever owns the rights to these films is trying to make a killing here. Packaging several rather poor films with one a lot of fans really want, and at this price, is not very good. M & L films started going downhill and that trajectory is made up of the films in this collection. 'Hollywood' remains popular with their fans because it was their last one. I imagine the owners are going to stick it to us fans one more time. Something tells me Lewis is the guy calling the shots on this effort.In the meantime, I'll just catch it when it's on tv."
3,Why 8 movies in the first volume and only 5 in this? Where's the other 3?,"Where's ""At War with the Army"", Money from Home and Three Ring Circus?"
4,"Great, but missing 2 things","I think its great that these movies are now available on dvd for people to see. Even better for people like myself who did not grow up during the time when they were released. I am however disappointed that Money From Home and 3 Ring Circus were not in the set. I know that during these two films there was tension on the set between martin and lewis, but that doesn't mean that the films shouldn't be released. Other than that, films are a must for any martin and/or lewis fan."
5,Another great collection of Martin & Lewis,My favorite movies in this collection is Pardners & Your Never Too Young. But they are all great and have finally added it to my collection of Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis.
3,Robert Calvert - 'Freq' (Cleopatra),"Maybe not his best work, but this 1984 dated release (like having it on CD reissue) by the late Hawkwind resident poet/recitalist is decent. Tracks here that I thought were good include ""Ned Lund"", the somewhat edgy ""All The Machines Are Quiet"", ""Cool Courage Of The Bomb Squad"" and the cult favorite (in it's own right)""Lord Of The Hornets"". Check out the line-up on this record: Calvert-guitar,harmonica,keyboards&vocals, Lemmy-bass, Huw Lloyd Langton-guitar, Steve Swindells-keyboards and Simon King-drums. Didn't realize this album had four 'actual' Hawkwind members. Nice."
4,"A good, somewhat scary read","This book was hard to put down. Very well written and informative read. The only problem was I had to sleep with the lights on a few weeks after I read it! If you scare easily, perhaps this book is not for you. The point of the book is to make you feel better about ghosts and to learn about them. You might learn more than you cared too and if your like me, your imagination can run wild, especially with the lights off! ;) If you think you have a ghost, this would be a good book to read as it tells you how to get rid of them."
4,"Easy, breezy read!","The author, Echo Bodine, writes about two of my favorite subjects in this book: psychics and ghosts. She covers a great deal of ground in this small book and her writing style is warm and friendly, if a bit immature. Some readers may be annoyed by the writing style and the fact that Ms. Bodine occasionally repeats herself but overall this is a good read."
2,"Relax, It's Only a Book","I certainly like Bodine's breezy way of writing, but I expected a little more from this than the shallow job I received. I wish she had gone into research about the spirits she encountered so we would know for a fact that they existed as she claims. Instead, she repeats herself often about the rules of ghosts, and tacks on a ridiculous chapter about dealing with a ghost. Of course, she also claims the ultimate Catch-22: if you believe in the spirits, you can see them; if you do not see them, you are not a believer. I will wait until I see them. This was a really short read, but I wish it had more substance."
1,Don't spend your money,"I bought this one couple months ago, but now it doesn't work.. 10 bucks are not big deal, but you shouldn't do it every 2 months."
1,Was open on arrival,This arrived today. The packaging was sealed but after opening the package I found that the cheap plastic cover was totally off the Tamarind Paste and the seal was even broken. Obviously I won't be eating it.
3,Too Large for Kids Ears,"The earrings are fine quality, but just not for kids. The size of the item should have been included."
2,Looks nothing like the picture,"This color is nothing like the picture. The polish is actually a sheer bluer color. In this picture it comes off as a solid mint/teal color but in reality, it is very light and sheer and is much bluer than the picture."
2,Go On No Green,"This product wasn't what I expected. It looked like green online but when I got it, it was blueish. Not what I expected."
3,Wasn't what I expected,"I was expecting a mint but got a kinda see thru green which wasn't I wanted to expected. However, it is kinda pretty when it's got two coats on."
3,"Pleasant, Proper Fragrance","First by VCA is a very rich and opulent fragrance created in the mid-1970s. The florals are blended wonderfully, but First is also an aldehyde. That aldehyde aspect is very prominent in the opening, and it's not to my liking. However, the drydown is quite pleasant once the aldehydes and florals pass, wearing more like a woody on me.For an EdT, this is extremely well done and long-lasting. I have an EdT made in France marked 76% alcohol, which is a concentration that is more typically associated with strong EdPs or weak parfums. Don't let the EdT designation put you off - this is strong stuff!I'd place First into the same camp and Chanel no 5. If you like Chanel 5, I think you're likely to like First and vice versa.However, with all the positive things going for this fragrance, it's just not my style and seems too pleasant, too proper, and too dated for wearing in this century."
5,cologne,"I ordered ""First"" by Van Cleef & Arpels, the 3.3 ounce spray bottle. This was my first order with Amazon.com I was very pleased with the product, delivery time, and condition of the order when it was received. I would consider ordering this product again. Unfortunately I am unable to obtain this product in the state that I reside, so I am pleased that I have this website to order this product in the future."
2,Not sure it's First,"My boyfriend said he really liked this scent; I foolishly bought it without trying it. Too strong for me. If I apply very lightly, it disappears. Won't buy again."
1,So not worth it...,"The directions are very confusing...The subjects covered are unneeded and repetative...The ride/shop lists are impossible to navigate...The directions for the Scenarios are completely useless (especially La La Land, which I haven't been able to complete)...So, the verdict is...Don't buy this guide. It's horribly done and is a waste of money..."
3,Graphics Hurts this game,"If you could afford the latest computer you will probably love this game. But if your like me, and cannot, you will become frustrated at the fancy graphics hogging all your computers ""thinking"" capacity when 5 rollercoasters are the limit to this ""fun"" park.They need to reduce some of the graphics to bring back some of the gameplay."
2,Wish I had researched...,"I am not a lens expert - not by a long-shot. But, I can say that I wish I had researched this lens better before I bought it. Since purchasing it in January, I can say that I have read some rather poor reviews of it online. The numbers make it look like this is the perfect do-everything lens, especially with the VR. Such is not the case because I am left longing for more sharpness, a larger aperture, better zoom, etc.Here is a link to read a review: [...]By the way, the picture is not accurate on this! The lens is a bit bigger than the one in the picture!"
2,Not Bossy Enough,"There really isn't all that much when it comes to good party songs, and even as good hip hop songs. That has been the case with Kelis. Although she need a infectious groove with Milkshake a few years ago, her latest single doesn't actually capture the status she had before. Bossy, the first single from her upcoming record Kelis Was Here is a very weak song that doesn't deliver very well. The song isn't anything over the top where you could dance to the music and enjoy it. Although it is fair at first, it just gets quickly tiresome. This is really one of the very few tracks that isn't what it delivers as bossy.Song: D+"
5,Alan Braxe & Fred Falke remix kills it,"I have been looking for this remix for... probably 2 years. I heard it on a basement jaxx promo for Crazy Itch Radio and thought it was them. Maybe it was originally ghost written for them by one of these guys? Either way, it's great to have, sure to make the party bounce. (Man! How did I not know this was Braxe and Falke?) I'm a huge sebastiAn fan, and this mix hits the spot - downtempo ala HAL. I don't usually mix around that speed, but this is some deep inky blackness if you do. Respect to Kelis for choice in remixers."
5,Very Representative,"I thought Milkshake was cutting edge, Bossy just up's the anty. Kelis is in a class by herself. Different and that is to say alot these days with so many copy-cat diva in the game. She was the first to switch of the beat,......every thing she gives claim too is real and she is the only...she's BOSSY. Exective Producer on all her SH....t."
2,When It first came out it was barely ok now it has diminished,"I am a Kelis fan, and I definately admire her music. I have all of her cds Kaleidoscope,Tasty, and the rare Wanderland... All had strong singles, but this is her weakest yet.Milkshake was a strong stand out song that had a lasting effect. This song is to mellow. And, how can you dance to this??? Its nothing but a theme song"
1,Plug & Don't Play peripheral,"Plugged it in, both, to 110 volts and to the USB port on my PC. It will not connect my scanner or my Altec Lansing Speakers even after reloading my USB driver."
4,Bo is still awesome,"This video reminds people of how Bo Jackson, regarded by a lot as the best athlete in American sports history, played during his prime. Interviews were not interesting, but there were indeed a lot of precious footage about his college career when he won the Heisman Trophy, his major league adventure and NFL highlights. Most notable were Bo's 'walking on the wall' catch, amazing outfield assists, home run during 89 MLB all star game, 'running-into-tunnel' after TD, as well as the 'play' that triggered his injury and retirement. All in all, you would like it if you like Bo. He was in fact the kind of superhuman people talked about. Just Awesome."
5,One of the Greatest Books,This is one of the most sigificant books in millenniums. Please have faith in what I am saying this book is before its time!!!!!!!!!
1,Micro Innovations SoftTouch Keyboard,"This was supposed to work with Window XP, it didn't! I tried everything I could think of to make it work and I know computers.I tried to return it, but that ended up being more of a pain to do. I just threw it away!!"
3,it has it's good parts,"This is by no means an innovative album or a landmark in indutrial music, but it has it's good parts. This is a good album for the industrial fan who needs to get away from the standard of nin, skinny puppy, ministry , and try something a touch different. A recommended track would be freemasons, but dont plan on being blown away. It will make you realize just how talented and important skinny puppy is to your music collection"
2,Technically flawed and not very helpful,"It gets two stars because its better than nothing, but not by much. The chapters advance more or less randomly, sometimes repeating, sometimes skipping ahead or backward and the information is no more than you would discover in a single half-hour of exploring on your own. No useful tips or inside explanations, just a slim and uninteresting overview."
3,Hard to Read Text,"I bought this book to help explain to my 5 yr. old about his 2 yr. old sister having autism. I couldn't just read the book to him as is. The words are written out of proper sequence which made it impossible for him to understand unless I corrected it as I read it to him. For example: If I was to say, ""I am going to the store."", the book would say, ""Going to the store I am."" I was very dissapointed in the book. Instead of being a teaching/learning tool, it's just a nice poetry book with nice pictures. My autistic daughter loves looking at them."
2,Disappointing- although terrific illustrations,"I purchased this book because I work with a boy whose younger brother has autism. He is having a hard time understanding why his little brother gets all of the attention. I was hoping this book would shed some light for him. Sadly, I am not sure that presenting this book will help. The author appears to have been more concerned with adhering to the rhyme scheme than to effectively conveying any well-meaning ideas. I felt the ""Yoda-esque"" writing style was distracting and could likely confuse less than stellar readers or those with reading comprehension difficulties. Well meaning as the work is, I would not recommend this for young readers who want to learn more about autism. The editor did not do his/her job well at all."
4,"German Engineering, American Upholstery","Couch's German roots are all too evident in the solid ""motorik"" grooves that form the foundation of these instrumental pieces - a more steadfast interpretation of the rhythmic legacy established by the likes of Can, Neu! And Kraftwerk. The surprise comes in the form of delicately chiming and deliciously abrasive guitar accompaniment, more reminiscent of American outfits like Band Of Susans or Slint than European counterparts. Couch's music is carefully considered, deceptively monotonous yet ever-building in intensity, and goes that little bit further towards dismantling whatever stereotypes may exist regarding German ""post"" rock bands."
1,car player review,Broke within 12 hours of purchase - very cumbersome and non-flexible for different types of cars. Wouldn't recommend.
1,If I could give it a zero I would!!,This product broke the first time I used it. Then part of the jack on this unit got stuck in my accessory plug in my vehicle costing me money in repairs!! Then tryng to return the item was a joke. Needless to say I wasted my time and money on this item!!
4,FM XMITTER,"Great transmitter, only problem it takes a while toturn on. You have to hold it for a few seconds, besides thata great FM TRANSMITTER......."
5,Still Perfect After 1 1/2 Years,"I have had this LG HDTV for over a year, got it around New Year's in 2007. It still works as good today as it did the day I got it, and I have had no problems with the picture at all. The picture is crisp and clear and the HD makes the differences between stations very apparent. Some shows appear a little blurrier than others when viewing Standard Definition broadcasts, but of course are amazing when viewing the High Def channels. The only issue that I have had and that I have read about is a humming or buzzing sound coming from behind the TV only when I first turn the set on, lasting for about a minute or two."
5,Great Speakers with great features,I am really impressed with the sound quality and the volume control/speaker jack/mute button control is really useful. I believe these sound better than other computer speakers that I paid a lot more for. I highly recommend them.
5,A wonderful gift to anyone living in/around the Great Lakes!,spaticular photos. good stories about key lighhouses. author is the pilot and writer. very well organized for easy access to any/all GL lighthouses
4,Spectacular Buildings,"""Chateaux of the Loire Valley"" is quite interesting and has some nice photos. It gives a lot of information on the most prominent chateaux of the region and their description along with the interesting bits of history. The book also contains the map, chronology of the most important facts of French history and the genealogy of the French kings. The only serious disadvantage of the book is that the chateaux are listed according to alphabet (rather formally) and not in chronological or geographical order, which would be more convenient."
3,Better get rechargeable batteries,"This is my second cordless mouse and first cordless optical mouse. This mouse handles well, feels well, good software and no problems with other wirelss devices.One major issue; it consumes batteries like no tomorrow. I have used all types of batteries and all brands. On an average a decent Energizer battery for electronic devices will last about 3 weeks. My only conclusion is to get use rechargeable or the battery costs will pretty high."
3,Much less useful than the first book,"Although Street Talk 2 shares many of the strengths of the first book (sample dialogues, plain English translation, exercises etc.), I found the vocabulary much less useful than in Street Talk 1. (Maybe, I just didn't get in touch with the 'right' people, but I recognized rather few of the terms while in the US.)"
5,Gorguts at their best,"Gorguts is one of those bands that seems only to make an album only if it's going to be some very good work, as opposed to just having a bunch of filler songs and a few good tracks. It's just something about their sound, and those dark sounding, echoing chords with the dissonance that propells them away from conventional death metal,along with some [exceptional]technicality. Buy this now if you want to hear something that you will be listening to for months down the line."
3,sounds like a band that listened to but did not compose obscura,"pretty good --but not great, as obscura was. Best way to describe this is that it sounds like a really eclectic death metal band. I hear a lot of interesting influences; sounds like they were listening to justice era metallica, early 90's era obituary, a good dash of suffocation, and, of course, sounds like they listened to an album called obscura by gorguts. But it's almost like they took no more from it than they did from he others i mentioned. This is neither good nor bad, just a description of what i hear when i throw it in. Overall, i give it 3.5 stars."
3,"Meh, depends where your coming from","Seriously, to the guy below me, the joke's wearin thin, you can stop pretendin to love the mainstream now when its obvious your into decent music yourself such as this. Time to call it a day.I guess if you do what i did, (listen to Obscura first) you'll be disappointed by this. Its undoubtedly impressive, but doesnt have the same crunch that the latter has. FWTH is one of those cds you wished you'd heard earlier than you did so you could enjoy it more. If your new to Gorguts, (they're not another crappy Gore-grind band as the name suggests; nothing like Gorgasm, Embalmer and the like) get this first then pick up Obscura. You'll be blown away twice, instead of once :P"
1,Messy... Don't be fooled by the name.,"What the hell is this ? Sounds like a mix between korn's vocal style and slipknot's sound...What a let down! First of all, don't think all deathmetal bands sound this terrible and weak...Because, there are much more bands who actullie got talent. If you do want a good album by gorguts tho ? make sure you get a copy of obscura, ok ?Now,thats a realy amazing release and thats how gorguts realy sounds but from wiston to hate is nothing but pure crap. Not recommended, trust me!"
5,Excellent Lens!,"Not sure why everyone is saying this is an expensive lens.. Has anyone priced dedicated 400mm lenses?.. They're in the $10,000 range. For the price I think this is an amazing lens. I bought it to shoot car racing and it pulls the action in close. love it!"
4,"Big, slow, heavy, expensive but great.","I agree with most of the other reviewers of this lens. It is big, heavy, slow and way too expensive. However, I have used it to capture some awesome shots coupled to my D80.It's first outing was a trip to the Galapagos, where I used this and and a 18-200 mm as my mainstays. I missed a few shots here and there because this beast could not focus fast enough-- but these were mostly bird shots. I have not needed to use tripod for most shots-- the tripod mount has been useful in order to stabilize the heft of the lens. I am trying the benefits of fixing this to a tripod right now to see how that works out. Despite the high price this was a great buy!"
4,Buy it and enjoy it,"I have had this lens for several months now and have probably shot 5,000 or more images. I use it on a D300 and shoot mainly birds, butterflies,and nature (BunnHillPhoto on flickr for recent shots). It is a great walking-around lens; it is not for sports or rapidly moving objects (though with practice you can get sharp images of birds in flight by panning). The sharpness of this lens is incredible throughout the range. VR really works. I have shot handheld at about 1/125 of a second at 400mm and the image is still quite sharp. I removed the tripod collar, and the resulting weight and balance on the D300 are superb. The AF is slow and tends to hunt sometimes and I wish it would focus a little closer than the specified 7.5 feet, but otherwise this is an excellent product and truly worth the investment."
5,Love this lens,This lens has excellent sharpness and fine color/contrast handling. It will a perfect every day lens.
3,There is a better combination,The speed of the focusing of this lens leads me to think that the 70-200 2.8 VR would be a better lens to own. If you really need the extra zoom then get the 2x teleconverter and without it you have a much faster lens that shoots at 2.8! And you will have the advanced VR panning mode.
4,Be careful with the weight,"No problems at all. A reliable item and in according to the specifications. I've bought this item for my hobby but I have not thought I would have some dificulties with its weight. It's a non essencial lens in my case, and I've only use it two times in all my Eastern Europe trip. I've sold it when I came back and I've bought a Superzoom camera. It is so much lighter, despite the image quality is not so good than using the 80-400"
4,Nikon 80-400vr,"Great lens with a learning curve. Used on a D300 by an event photographer. Replaced a 70-300vr. Should have keep the 70-300as well as the 80-400. There is a use for both. The 80-400vr is not a ""fast"" lens but given a fairly still subject and time you will get a good photo.Current lenes I use:Tokia 11-16 f2.8nikon 17-55 f2.8"" 24-70 f2.8"" 70-200 f2.8"" 18-200"" 28-200g"" 28-80g"" 35mm 1.8"" 50mm 1.4"" 50mm 1.8"" 85mm 1.4d"" 105mm 2.8 macro"
2,Last only 2 days.,"What can I say, must be my dog is too strong on the toy. She is a Lab. and has a tendency to destroy stuffs."
5,20 mm. F/ 2.8D Nikkor lens,"It is extremely sharp even at full aperture and it works well. It is an old design, and Nikon could probably improve it with vibration reduction, but it works fine as it is. I only have an 85 mm. fixed focus lens which I use mainly for portraits. This wide angle lens helps me with nature and social shots. A zoom would be more versatile but I like the slightly better definition of the fixes focus lenses."
2,Blurry,"The images come out soft and even a bit blurry, it is slow to focus and makes a lot of noise. I bought the Sigma 10-20mm and am much happier with it and it's have a very wide field."
4,"Not too long, not too wide for indoor on DX","Note: I'm using this on D7K, which has a built in focusing motor; manual focus only on bodies without.35mm is probably the most popular all around lens, but from my experience the 52mm equivalent on DX makes it a tad too long for indoor. On Full frame it's probably just right.I was hesitant to go this wide and was contemplating the Nikon 24mm f/2.8D AF (35mm equivalent), but it didn't quite get the same positive reviews as the 20mm. While the 35mm f/1.8G AF-S has received outstanding reviews, i just didn't want to settle on that focal length, so i took the plunge with the 20.Great decision! Most would probably use this lens for landscape, but i find it just right for indoor candids of the family. I never worry about available shooting space and never find it too wide.Sure it's not a 1.8, but 2.8 is plenty fast for a camera like the D7k where high iso is a non-issue."
4,"Compact, put it all in the frame lens","I use the 20mm with my D80. My title highlights my two favorite features. I went for the 20 after I analyzed the first month of my shots with the kit lens were over 50% in the wider (18mm) range. With a prime I wanted high image quality, sharpness, simplicity and of course small package.The 20mm gives you small size, great ability to 'get it all in' and in many cases delivers outstanding sharpness. [...]If your doing snapshot style, group photo's of people or casual shooting I think you'll be better served w/ the 18-20mm portion of your kit zoom. This lens does require attention to deliver consistently sharp images.With that caveat being said I can honestly say that in the 5 or so months I've owned it this is my go to, default lens... size matters! Happy Shooting!"
4,Getting to know a little known part of America,"A compelling read. The author takes the reader to a part of America that I never knew existed. This isn't like Mayberry, it's the new real west.Celis takes you into the hearts and homes of the residents of Cortez. You really care what happens to the people in this story and get to see all sides of the conflict. A wonderful year-in-the-life look at the rural west and the folks that choose to live there."
5,My Mom Loved This DVD!,My mother raves about the quality of this film. She has watched it several times and thinks the narration was excellent.
3,It was a guess.,"I had no idea what this smelled like. I bought it just hoping it would smell nice. I was just satisfied with it. It is not the best and I would not buy it again, however it is not that bad where I won't use it. I do use it and plan to use the whole bottle. Not a bad price either."
2,IT'S OK.,I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BOTTLE WAS SITTING AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE IT WAS SENT TO ME WHERE IT LOST IT'S STRENGTH BUT IT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THE BOTTLE THAT I BOUGHT AT THE STORE. USUALLY THIS PERFUME IS WONDERFUL BUT THIS ONE JUST DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME.
1,Wonderful scent but as weak as water!!!!,I was appaled after buying a bottle from Wal-Mart yesterday! It still is the most gorgeous scent Ive ever smelled but blown away that the scent only lasted less than one hour! Who would believe someone could marr such a beautiful scent like this and make it out to be as cheap as the Dollar Store products! Shame on Jovan for watering down the scent! I won't ever waste my hard earned money ever again. BUYER BEWARE!
3,"Arrived way early, but...","I was really pleased when this arrived very early. The packaging was excellent. But the scent is off.Now, don't get me wrong, Amazon is amazing, and the vendor might be a good vendor that bought a bad batch of Jovan Musk. Just be warned."
2,Photo is incorrect,"Bought this thinking it was Jovan Musk because the photo is that of Jovan Musk. Instead got Jovan Woman, NOT the same sent. Will have to give it away cuz I think it stinks."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I'VE USED JOVAN MUSK FOR OVER 30 YEARS. THIS DID NOT LAST A WEEK, USUALLY YOU JUST NEED A FEW SPRITZ. I HAD TO ALMOST EMPTY THE BOTTLE THE FIRST TIME TO GET SOME SMELL ON. VERY DISAPPOINTED. SHIPPING WAS PROMPTLY."
2,Jovan Musk-Not!,"Not the Jovan Musk of years ago...this is a very light fragrance that does not stay with you very long....I will use it for a bedtime spray, but not for going out. There was one review that mentioned it was not the original fragrance, I believe them now, and should have paid closer attention to their comments. My Bad!"
1,Stinky Musk!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is FAR from smelling like musk,it STINKS,I would NEVER recommend it to anyone!!!! To top it off it can't be returned!!!!!"
2,Disappointing - Bond fans beware,"After enjoying Mabel Maney's previous books (Nancy Clue, Hardly Boys), I was excited to see a spy parody novel and looked forward to my weekend alone with the book. Unfortunately, the book didn't live up to my expectations. Partly this is because I love spy movies, and so while I wanted humor and parody, I also wanted Jane Bond to be at least somewhat competent and interesting (she was not). I wanted some cleverness to the storyline. I wanted the characters to speak with different voices, not all sound like an aspect of the same person. It comes off as rather smug humor after a while. I sort of felt as though Maney was doing her imitation of Armistead Maupin (author of Tales of the City).Check out the Nancy Clue books before picking up Kiss the Girls and Make Them Spy -- because I want you to see that Maney does have a fun sense of humor. I just don't find it in this book."
3,"Bond, Jane Bond.","This book was a lot of fun. Very campy, but very much a parody of the whole James Bond franchise. This author is apparently one for parody ~ her other books are a series of mysteries involving a teen sleuth named Nancy Clue.I'm not a fan of mysteries by any definition, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It kept me turning the page until I reached the end, and I would definitely read another in this series."
4,Beautiful set,"I Love the set, however the pieces are all a bit small scale. I guess I will have to get use to taking three scoops of vegetables instead of two"
1,Ginkgo green hostess set,I am very please with the hostess set. Years ago I received a set as a gift and they served me well. I still use them but decided I could use another two sets. I was happy I was able to find them.
5,unit is compatible w/ps2,"since Grand-Turismo3 comming out and this new steering wheel and all, I thought I'd give it a try buying one of these steering wheels to play with GT-3. shopping around for it and everyone being sold out a friend told me about this one. I bought it, hooked it up, and what do you know, IT WORKED! This wheel is compatible with the PS-2. That's if you don't care about the free speakers! So just look at it this way, it can be used on your computer too! So you don't have to waste your money on two wheels! Enjoy!"
1,bad game controller,"I sell this today because is better my thrustmaster wheel (nascar racing but the old without forcefeedback ) I can hit the stop with a low amount of acceeleration, for me the bad wheel I have in my computer."
2,Clearly the worst wheel I've ever bought.,"There are many bad things about this wheel. For 1, whenever you turn it, it turns way to far to the side, and the car you are driving goes off the track. Another thing is, the pedals don't work very well. When you push even a millimeter dow on the gas pedal, the car speeds way up. Also, the brake/reverse pedal doesn't work at all. You have to reset the car if you want to reverse. On some games, the gas apedal and thebrake/reverse pedal don't work at all. When this happens, the car just speeds ahead, and there is no way to slow it down. Never the less, the wheel doesn't break easily, and it has rumbel built in. If you want a good wheel, then I advise you to by one without pedals."
5,Pretty good wheel,"Very good wheel... works great with all my driving games IE Midtown Madness 1 & 2, NFS Hot Pursuit 2 and it definately helped out in Midnight Club 2. Overall.... its a very good reasonably priced wheel."
3,Little too jerky,Overall a good buy for the money. Wheel is very jerky and too sensitive in Nascar racing and Indy Car racing. Turning on Steering assist in Nascar racing smooths things out but some online leagues don't allow this. Pedals are OK. Spaced very well. Brake pedal feels very sensitive.
3,Steers Well But Doesn't Vibrate,"To save money, I purchased this older wheel which was listed in ""like new"" condition by a seller. It turns out that the wheel's ""force feedback"", or vibration technology, is obsolete and doesn't work with WINDOWS programs after VISTA. This is according to a Logitech representative who answered a question on the Internet. It steers well, but there's no vibration, and it will never have any no matter how many buttons are pushed. I guess the feedback happens with the newer Logitech wheels such as the Driver model. I kept it anyway."
1,garbage dont waste your money,this wheel was very awkward and impossible to calibrate accurately. also has too many wires and connections. not very comfortable. i used it 3 times and threw it in the garbage.
3,"Good product, but...","First, let me say this is a really nice product. I bought it for my kids to use with their various racing games. It works really well and installed quite easily. The bad news is that the force feedback feature works with precious few games."
2,kind of sucked...,Well the suction think doesn't work right...it is waterproof however and that's the only stars it really gets...i mean it works well but mine broke after two months which is ridiculous...i wouldn't buy this again...
3,Historic artifact,"Funny French reply to English ""Pygmalion""-or own interpretation of the ancient Greek story,-this movie is of an African peasant of a ""Maharaja"" land (Maharaja was a tribe ruler title in India) turned into grand dame of Paris with learning her European rules of courtesy.Probably, it was interesting for viewers of the pre-race-equity timing when being white was already a sign of prosperity somewhere in then ""developed"" world also acting and music are good as a general information of days passed could testify to the history real."
3,King Kino,"A long time ago, in the early days of the 20th Century, the Madonna of French society was a vivacious, exotic black singer/dancer named Josephine Baker. Blessed with enormous eyes and an infectious smile, she starred in her 3rd movie, ""Princess Tam Tam"", in 1935. A French version of Pygmalion, ""Princess Tam Tam"" stars Baker as a wild African shepard, reformed(somewhat), and brought to Paris for exhibition. The story lacks momentum, but, in the end, Baker breathes life into the film. ""Princess Tam Tam"" is part of the Kino Josephine Baker DVD-trilogy. Kino's transfer includes a documentary, songs, and other generous extras. Once again, Kino is King."
1,"Love the watch, hate the watchband","This watch is beautify if you have average to large wrists. I have a small wrist so after having a few links removed, the watchband kept breaking. I now have $65 invested in repairs and will not do it again. Am considering contacting Bulova. The watch itself was a great price through Amazon and is lovely."
4,very feminine,"I have never liked the masculine look of so many of today's watches for women. This watch is very dainty and feminine looking and the face is easy to read. The clasp is a little difficult to maneuver, but is sturdy. Amazon has by far the best price on this watch - half as much as some other sites! I am enjoying wearing this pretty little watch."
5,Love it!,"I received this watch as a gift a year and a half ago. I have yet to have a single problem with it! It still shines like the day I got it and I continue to get compliments on it. I've literally worn it everyday since I got it, and the face has no scratches on it, although the clasp in the back has a few but they are not noticeable. the one thing I would change about this watch is I would make the face a little larger, but if you have a small wrist it looks very cute and feminine. I would reccomend this watch to anyone :)"
5,great,"Everything about this transaction was great!!! Great product, great service, and great shipping in a timely manner. Thanks, I love my new watch!!"
1,Toy watch?,I was all excited to open the box for this watch. I opened it up and I laughed! The dial on the watch is so small it looks like a childs watch. It looks nothing like it does in the picture. I sent it back that day. The watch is a total joke. Dont buy it!
3,Not bad!,"I love Bulova watches, that's all I wear. However this watch is nice, the pictures are a bit deceiving. The face is smaller that what the picture depicts. But, that's ok because I love it anyway....A whole lot of BLING!"
5,Woman's Crystal Watch Bulova #96T14,"Arrived just in time for Valintines day,good packaging,and my wifeloved it A++++++++++++++++"
2,Adequate but not much more,"This would be only for someone with very little casino time and no knowledge of baccaarat. It's nicely done, but the actual information and play time is slow. The slot information is old, but then it's an old CD so what did you expect? The bacarrat teaching is a small amount it's only to demonstrate to play."
4,Awesome product - poor support,"This is a great printer and delivers on HP's promises. It is very versatile for small office printing. In our office though, we have a particular need to print from Autocad. This printer will not print properly as a system printer from Autocad (at least not in Windows 2000). There is a problem with the HP driver. This was solved by configuring the printer to print from Autocad using an older driver for a Laserjet 5. I do get an annoying device conflict warning every time I print though. This was accomplished, I might add, with no help from HP whatsoever. Not that I didn't try. Their primary solution seems to be to throw a bunch of HP users together and let them help each other. No one had a solution for my particular problem. HP makes great products, it is a shame that their support is so substandard. Product quality 5, minus 1 for lack of support."
2,Fog on glass,"I can't attest to this lens giving a sharp photograph because it had a fog over the inner element had a hazy fog layer over it. I I did an internet search and found this is a common problem. I don't have anything else to add here other than, if you buy this lens do so with caution."
4,Useful,"I have this lens on a D90. There are sometimes when I wish it was a little wider, but for the most part I can get most of what I need using this."
2,Disappointing,"First, let me say that I purchased this book on a recommendation and went in with no preconceived notions. But unlike the rest of the reviews, I didn't like the book. I found its plot too sweet, too contrived and the characters hollow. I can say that Laurey's powers of description are wonderful. You feel like you're in the small, quaint English village or in the B and B or in Orchard House. But even with the 'quaint' feeling, I couldn't finish the book for the reasons stated previously. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy sweet, sappy, gushy love stories, which I don't."
1,what the?,"Well I thought that this would be a decent film since it has some semi-known actors and actresses in it. About a hour and a half into the film I was still waiting for something interesting to happen. Well I couldn't wait any longer and had to turn this off. (Robert Downey does have 1 or 2 moments of half-way interesting dialogue but that is where this movie ends). They all went on a skiing trip in this movie and the only way that this movie would have redeemed itself is if a giant avalanche came crashing down on everyone and they mercilessly perished . No such luck - I guess I will have to wait for the sequel for this, god help us!"
3,Nothing to challenging but cute and warm,"All of the reviews you have read to this point have been pretty accurate, for the most part. And, yes, I can easily see how this movie would receive anywhere from 1 to 4 stars--it just depends on what mood you're in and what you're looking for. The acting in this film, while not necessarily Oscar material, is cute and suitably campy. The one-liners are very well-timed. The cast is fairly balanced, ranging from a weak performance by Claudia Schiffer all the way to the very creative and noteworthy antics of Stephen Baldwin and Robert Downey Jr. Yes, it's predictable and none too challenging to follow, but if you need cute laughs for the above 18 crowd, you may want to check it out."
4,Excellent romantic comedy,"In the style of <i>The Big Chill</i>, this wonderful romantic comedy offers good character development, exceptional one liners, and a surprisingly good performance from Robert Downey, Jr. as he attempts to support the boring performance painfully offered by Claudia Schiffer. The ending is a little predictable but enjoyable."
5,Great Movie,Gave it a 5 star rating.Movie fill with an all star cast.I recommended to anyone who want to watch and comedy and romance movie.
1,What a sham!!,"If you just arrived on planet earth, you might learn something new from this book. It's simply pretentious, semi-academia hip chatter which is kept so politically and legally correct that you learn absolutely nothing! Your aunt in Omaha probably knows far more interesting stories of the old Hollywood stars than the author relates here. Save your money and get a far better, gutsier, and truthful read in the tabloids. At least they call a gay actor gay, and don't disclaim for the sake of potential lawsuits. A really lousy book!"
4,Better than most Gay-Hollywood studies.,"This book is slightly more academic perhaps than most of the Gay Hollywood books are. If you're really interested in the history of Hollywood's treatment of gays ... in front of the camera and behind; closeted and out... then this is a good starting point. Written compactly, it allows us a glimpse of things those of us outside the industry might otherwise not know.Worth a look."
4,Taking Gossip Seriously,"It's about time someone took a serious stab at updating Vito Russo's amazing Celluloid Closet. Ehrenstein's book not only covers the world of film, but to a certain extent television and other popular entertainment. I wish his style had been smoother (it ranges from academic to deliciously trashy) but he brings up many interesting points. The chapter on Tom Cruise was especially insightful (and Cruise's lawyers would be hard-pressed to find anything to sue about). I was a little surprised that he didn't go into more depth about how the World Wide Web is influencing what we know about the private lives of famous people (maybe he'll add something for the eventual paperback release). If you have more than a passing interest in this century's entertainment industry and how it impacts the lives of gay men and lesbians, you should have a look at this book. (Note to publisher: when you have an author this good-looking, for God's sake use a bigger picture of him on the cover!)"
1,Open Secret Equals Open Joke,"Most of the reviewers here seem to be on track but a few seem highly bizarre --even suspect. One writes: ""A must for any serious Hollywood History library."" HUH??? Serious Hollywood history? Try ""Wisecracker"" by W.Mann or ""Nazimova"" by G.Lambert for serious history. This might have made an interesting piece (way condensed) for OUT or VANITY FAIR, but this book is all over the place, gives no sense of chronology or historical development, and ultimately adds little to what we know about gay Hollywood history. A shame, too. Ehrenstein's a good journalist; maybe it's his editor's fault."
4,"By no means a serious study of GayHollywood, but a good read","...nonetheless. This book is not a distasteful one unlike a vast majority of books about gays in Hollywood. It is also quite entertaining and should be regarded only as such: an entertaining book on a summer's day... In this case it does not really matter, whether the material is credible or not. If you do not take what you read TOO SERIOUSLY, then you will enjoy this book. If you want some serious study about gay actors, then look some place else for it."
2,"Dull, Dull and Dreadful","This book has no life to it---I mean the writing--it is redundant, heavy, lackluster. Reads like a boring college research textbook. The author repeats and repeats and is consumed and obsessed with Ellen Degeneres over and over again. It is not like a book, but an overblown article. There is nothing new in the book--it is a historical account of gay and lesbians in Hollywood and boring as can be. Sorry I bought it but am thankful I got a used copy and did not pay much. I could hardly wait to finish it to throw it out as I did not even want to keep it. Forget this dull and dreadful book!"
3,This company's assortment doesn't sort,"This company listed three different items in their assortment so I bought three and received 3 of the same thing. I don't want three of the same thing but I didn't not see a way to ask them about it before I bought. I mean I was thinking that they might even have more metal options and I wanted more of those but the one I received wasn't even a metal one it was only clawdigger, 3 clawdiggers. Ebay is so much better you can ask questions before hand with the ask a question button. I don't even know how to send the items back and get my money back. With ebay if you have a problem you can always get your money back from paypal."
3,Good choice for young readers,"I really liked this book, but I had to give it only three stars because of the language in it. A lot of the verbiage seemed almost patronizing, but I think for a younger audience, this would be perfect. Some of the points in the book were very good, and some of the parts (especially in chapters 10 and 11) really felt like was talking to me directly.What I liked most about this book, however, was that it includes boys a lot throughout the book. I think this is an important aspect that not a lot of books touch on. I think with the statistics being so hard to come by for boys, there is a lot more difficulty for boys to tell and feel like they are not the only ones out there that this might be happening to. For that alone this book should get five stars. I would highly recommend this book to any adolescent, especially males!"
3,Still hurting.,"First, I'm sorry about Ms. Mather's pain. She was badly hurt. Writing about her experience has got to help. The opening chapter hooked me to purchase the book. Since I'm far from being a teenager, I soon lost interest in her advise and instructions for abused kids. I thinks all kids should read this book and understand the perils of being abused and accepting gilt and shame. This book, being written for kids, was far to redundant for me. I returned it for a refund rather than reading the same message, which was driven home far too many times. I do not want young people who are attracted to this subject to pass up this book because of my comments. Reporting abuse may require a major decision in victim's lives, but it's better than living with pain."
5,"Wow, what a wild ride","I couldn't put this one down. It starts out with the attempted murder of former FBI agent, Leigh O'Brian. Her ex-husband, Gabe Sanchez, has to jump into a lake to save her, only to realize that Leigh has amnesia. She doesn't have a clue who he is, and she's not about to trust him. Gabe and Leigh have to work together to find out who's trying to kill her and why. What happens then is an action packed, dangerous ride that's filled with twists and turns."
4,Good value for money,Pros:Solid build.Relatively quick focus (despite of missing USM).Bokeh almost perfect.Cons:Strong purple CA with high-contrast scenes.Weight.In general - good value for money.MUCH better pics after 70-300VR.
5,Awesome lens,"I have used this lens for about a year now. I freelance for newspapers and various other things. I have to agree that this lens is heavy but after shooting a basketball game I don't go running back to my car for a monopod. I don't have a big problem with the lens's weight. In reality it weighs almost as much as my D3. The reason I went for this lens was because I bought it when I was in college and couldn't afford the 70-200 VR. I haven't really had a need for the VR anyway. The only problem that I have encountered was the rubber ring by the front of the lens is falling off, but a little glue took care of the problem.I would recommend this lens to anyone looking for a pro grade tele."
3,Didn't work right,"I like Nikon, but I happened to receive a lens that kept hunting for the focus and was not sharp. I had tried one in a store a few months before this one on the same cameras and it was great. Had a D90 and a D7000 at the time. Liked the cameras, when the D600 came out decided I wanted a full frame camera.Now have a D600 and a 28-300mm VR lens and they are great. In focus, sharp, good color. I can't wait for summer."
5,Amazing lens well done NIKON,"I bought this Lens before one week ago ,and i'm very happy to bought this lens ,simply it's amazing ,clear ,fast and very very sharp ,because of that I switched to NIKON ."
5,80-200mm,I was very happy with the way the lense was packaged. They used airbag cushions protecting the lense. The lense is in excellent condition when I received. I have no complaint.
2,80-200/ 2.8,"I am so happy with this lens. i think this is a keeper. I sometimes meet people who say that it is a lot better to have VR. This may not have it but quality and sharpness is excellent! i used it for sports, and portrait. it is a fantastic lens that will surely have space in bag."
4,Excellent lens by Nikon,"I was insterest on the Nikkor 70-200mm VR II but the excesive price of $2K its to much for my pocket. After several reviews and pictures that I found on the web I decided to try the Nikkor 80-200mm. After put in on my Nikon D90 and took some pics, I am very impress with the performance. The lens has a good construction and its heavy. The f2.8 its really fantastic to blur the background of a picture. It create a very nice ""bokeh"" on portrait. Very sharp and colorfull pictures. Fast focusing system. I don't try it for night picture but I think that gone to do a really nice job on those situations. I bought it for weddings and portrait primary. The 70-200mm VR II cost the double of the price of my 80-200mm so with that money that I dont spend I can buy now a good studio light kit."
