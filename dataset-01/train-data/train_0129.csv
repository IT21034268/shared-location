1,An essay of what god wants,"People who beleive in God may be offended because the author says that God wants something, if any, different from what beleivers already think he wants."
3,Nice title - few answers later on.,"The book is off to a flying start when it asserts that what ""God wants is nothing"", based, on the notion that an omniscient, omnipresent God can literally ""want"" for nothing, since He already *has* everything. Makes sense!From that starting point it is easy for the author to criticise many of religious systems, practices and teachings around the world. So far so good. Then comes the exciting point - how does this give us a deeper understanding? Where do we go from there. Unfortunately, the book is not a truly revolutionary book. If it was truly dangerous, surely, you would sit back and have your life changed ... but life is not changed.It has some bright spots though. I enjoyed:""that we should only think what we want to experience, say only what we choose to make real, and do only what we think is our highest reality.""With such insights I couldn't give it 1 or 2 stars. Which was tempting as the title suggests more content than is actually found in this book.-Simon"
2,Disappointed,"The odd thing is, every time I was in a bookstore and flipped open the book in the middle, it said good things...but when I actually bought the book and read the first, oh, 11-12 chapters, I was very disappointed. Skip those and it's a decent book.One of the most important things I've been learning with other books is the idea to focus on what you DO want, how you DO want to create and feel and live and enjoy. (""Ask and It Is Given,"" by Esther and Jerry Hicks is a superb example of that.)So, cutting off other people's heads (or organizations) to make yourself bigger isn't my idea of greatness. And the first half of this book does exactly that. Why waste time on all that negativity? Just focus on the part where we can be happy."
3,Gimmicky First Half,"**SPOILERS**I'm a fan of Neale's books. I've read them all several times, but I'm afraid that this one isn't very good. All of Neale's worst habits, as a writer, are on display here:-The self-important, melodramatic flourishes, ""This is a dangerous book""!!-The gimmicky buildup of suspense as we approach the moment he answers the question ""What does God want?""-The ""pun"" of the answer--a chapter that is four pages of blank paper. God wants nothing! Get it?Oh, Neale! You are your own worst enemy! You have so much that's worthwile to say, and yet you can't get over yourself enough to say it straight!Neale asks us to pass this book on to others, but I would never do that. They'd just laugh at it for all the reasons just cited. It's a shame. The ideas in this book really are what the world needs now.The book does improve in the second half. But that will be too late for those turned off by the smarmy first half.A missed opportunity."
4,Blow your mind!,"Unless you haven't read several of Walsch' books before this really blow your mind. If you have read several of his books, it still blow your mind.It's wonderfull to have ones perspectives mooved, and Walsch manage always to to that. The only problem with this book, at least for an european, is the language that also can be a challenge. That's why my rate is only four stars."
4,CWG comes full circle,"After 10 years or so of the Conversations With God series, Neale Donald Walsch pulls it all together in a wonderful summary. Having read all the other books there was little here for me that was new but then again - I was reading it through the eyes of another ""I am"" (see the book)It is not as harsh in tone as The New Revelations - more closely to the tone of Tomorrow's God.I would give it 5 stars but I really think for someone new to the series, they might read ""Communion With God"" first. It is gentle and makes you realize that what youi've felt all along about God inside - is true.But I do recommend this also!"
5,"Neale Donald Walsch's best, so far?","I have been reading and studying Walsch's series of 'Conversations with God' books for the last eight years. I have found them all particularly inspirational giving, as they do, a whole new perspective on God and spirituality. Two of the most 'practical' are Walsch's 'Communion with God' and 'What God Wants'.To truly understand the God wants nothing is a difficult concept to follow but what profound questions are answered if the reader can accept and come to live with this fact.I would suggest that potential readers might also care to read two of Walsch's other works: 'The New Revelations' and 'Tomorrow's God'."
5,Life-changing,"Even if you're skeptical, it's worth the read. This book will change the way you look at everything in life. Highly recommended."
4,"4 * Gratifying, But a LittleToo Gentle","Coltrane sounds wonderful here, and it's undoubtedly one of his most accessible works. That said, however, it's also somewhat less challenging and interesting than other CDS. For example, I much prefer the similar Coltrane/Johnny Hartman disc, where Coltrane's soulful sax is accompanied with near perfection by vocalist Hartman--it's one of the best jazz vocal albums ever made.Still, for relaxing and romantic straightforward jazz, this is hard to top. Coltrane achieves a marvelous, emotive sound, and his limber fingerings and creative reworking of these selections are the work of a master. Some may call this Coltrane-light, but if you want great songs interpreted with ease, fluidity, and imagination, this relaxing, mellow CD will be your cup of Trane."
4,Not the same as the LP,"This was one of my favorite John Coltrane records, as a double album released in 1974. I was pleased to see it here but disappointed to see a couple of numbers trimmed, I assume to fit on one CD. I could have done without ""Wise One"", but the version of ""The Spiritual"" that ended the original record is a real loss here. And if ""Alabama"" was cut down from the original 5:05 recording, as stated by one reviewer, that really is an awful thing to do to one of the better songs here.I may break down and buy a turntable."
5,Erotic brilliance and perfection,"This compilation album provides a cool, sensuous, evocative, and purely erotic soundtrack to spend a gentle romantic evening.Combining with the purely golden vocalist Johnny Hartman on several cuts (including my favorite version of the languid ""My One and Only Love""), Coltrane's sax drips with smooth sensual delight invoking visions of candlelight, midnight cityscapes, or in my rural case rolling hills enveloping in purple-orange twilight. This is a great classic album that invites the listener to kick off the dust of the day, leave a frantic busy week behind, close the eyes, wrap their arms around that special sensual person and waltz fingertips across the skin.A perfect mellowing agent for a frantic world. Intimate. Pure. Perfect.A must own."
5,"The perfect late-night, candlelight romance music","Simply the best laid-back, quietly jazzy, romantic, after-dark saxophone music I've heard. We're talking about Coltrane, after all! But there's nothing inaccessible here. Even the non-jazz listener will love the spare, smooooth, relaxingly mellow riffs, which never descend to cliche or for a second become a bore. This album oozes sophistication and class, and goes great with a martini or glass of port. Light a candle or two and put your arm around your lover. This is the perfect accompaniment to intimate occasions."
1,Miserable piece of trash,"You can see why they have fancy colour earpieces for this thing - they have to find something to appeal to you about it.I turned it in every conceivable orientation and never found a good fit to my ear. (In case you ask, I would describe my ears as ""average"" or ""normal""). A diagram on the packaging would have saved much frustration on that score.But NOTHING will compensate for the fact that the built-in microphone function is utterly useless. I thought maybe it was just me - but two friends also got suckered into buying one of these, and their cellphone calls went from reasonable to completely unintelligible.Do not, repeat NOT, buy this product."
1,incorrect listing in amazon,"Amazon shows this as an accessory for the Nokia 918 model phone. This is incorrect since the phone does not have a 2.5 mm plug for the earjack. Obviously, if you have a different model phone, that may not be the case."
2,"Interesting technology, but not entirely practical","I've been using the Jabra Universal EarSet for the last week with a Motorola Talkabout phone. The incoming call quality is very clear, but background noise will play a tremendous part in how well your voice is picked up. You'll sound very clear in a quiet environment-your home, office, suburbs, etc. With a television on, things can get muddled. Outdoors in a city during rush hour is terrible, requiring you to cup your ear to give your voice any kind of quality.Technology-wise, it's impressive how well the EarSet works, but for urbanites on the go, there are better products out there."
4,Better than the rest,Ive had this product for over a year with no problems. i tried the ones with the boom mikes which were more problems than any thing else and normaly i ended up hitting the mike with my hand.. also wearing sunglasses was discomforting as well.. With the jabra i noted no background noise while using the unit with the windows up and air on which is what you would want to do any way while carrying on a conversation in the car. as far as the body noise goes that problem can be solved easily however since the mike is part of the ear piece the person you are speaking to will hear all that you do this includes gritting teeth and chewing on m&m's while you talk over all though there is no better unit currently on the market that is as convenient..
1,Microphone ruins this product,"The earpiece may fit comfortably and even sound pretty good, however the microphone is not aceptable. I find that I have to speak way too loudly in order for the other person to hear what I am trying to say. Either I talk so loud that everyone around me hears my conversation or the person I'm calling can't hear me well enough. This is not an item I would recommend to anyone unless you really want to annoy anyone within 10 feet of you."
2,ok in the big city,"This earset worked fine in areas of good reception. In areas of low reception, the microphone didn't work well. People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone. I live in a rural area and this made the earset useless."
1,Bad try,"If you are expecting anything close to the first album , forget it. Sound is poor, selection so so . I would give it a value of $5.00. Very sorry I wasted the money."
3,Ehhhhh! Good but it isn't Mob Hits I,"I love my Mob Hits I, and thought that this would be just as wonderful. It is good, but not great. If you don't have MHI I suggest it, but II just doesn't pop."
5,Italian Music while cooking a pizza,My son loved it. I have another one and I knew he would love this. Got him pizza stone and accessories. They can play this cd while cooking a pizza. Came fast and in great shape. Thanks.
2,Not as good as the first,"I bought the original Mob Hits years ago and loved it! I was hoping there would be as many good songs on the second album. Not only were there half the amount of songs as the first, but they were also only half as good. If I had known what songs were on it, in advance, I probably would not have purchased it."
2,Disappointed,it was ok...not what i was expecting. I didnt care for the Christmas music that was mixed in...
5,Mob Hits II: More Music from the Great Mob Movies,Nice selection of songs - Brings back memories of the films they were heard in - Good quality and sound -
4,I Liked It!,"most of these people are crazy. sure, this isn't the best tony hawk game, but it is really fun and there are some cool new stuff in it."
4,Pretty good game.,I bought this game for my teenage son. My son loved the game. The only problem he had with it was that it was easy to beat. He beat the game in a little over a few days. He did enjoy the game quite a bit. I would recommend it but beware there may not be much play time if you spend a lot of time playing it.
2,Disappointing but Fun,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 was probably the best game in the series. Since THPS4, we have enjoyed a steady decline in difficulty and overall quality. This new game is so easy, in one sitting you can beat the game and retrieve all the pieces for your homemade skatepark, the ""Skate Ranch."" I have been a fanatic about these games since the beginning, and since we left the ""pro skater"" title, the games have become cheesy. The storyline is unbelievable (this game is starting to improve there, however), the character models are weird (all the pedestrians are about 3 feet taller than your character), and now, the game features one level only in story mode! I did enjoy playing through the game, though. Classic mode was fun, with harder goals than the story mode by far, and unlike story mode, you can completely customize your character. Personally, I think the previews made the game look much much cooler than it is. Another game like this and I'm finished with this series."
3,This seller is a major jerk.,This game didnt arrive til almost new year!! It was supposed to be a christmas present for my son but oh well. When I contacted the seller about merely getting a tracking number for my package because it was getting close to Christmas and I was nervous that it hadn't arrived he informed me that he was too busy taking care of his many other customers to look up tracking numbers for me and that for my valuable purchase of under 20 bucks there would be many other merchants on Amazon happy to take my business. He did however have the time to send me over 5 emails bantering back and forth about my purchase and the tracking number calling me inconsiderate and selfish. Oh and shipping was EXCESSIVE for the amount of packaging he put into it and the actual cost of the shipping itself. This man acts like a 2yr old.
3,Good but there is better stuff,"In this game you can play in classic or story modes. The story mode is entertaining at most and their is a glich in the my game so I can't do a wall flip when the french guy is trying to teach me. This is nly on the second level so. It also says you can ride BMX. This is true but the missions don't send you forward in the game, the just get you money. Not to mention it gets boring learning tricks you could learn by yourself. Bottom line is this game is entertaining but I'm sure there are better Tony Hawk games out there. I plan to try Tony Hawks underground 2 next."
1,THIS GAME STINKS,Five reasons why it stinks1. The BMX does manuals when you do not whant it to2. It is freaking imposible to do a wallflip3. The missions are pointless4. The graphics aren't as good as they say5. Yes. There is loadingyes I do have this game.
1,Not Good,"First of all, it was a regular battery not at all the extra capacity as stated and second it stopped taking a charge after 4 months.The whole phone is now ""outdated"" after less than a year, soI'm stuck with a piece of landfill. Why should I buy anotherbattery...when I can get another phone for ""free""."
4,I Miss My CD,I broke this CD and can no longer find it anywhere. It was a good cd if you like old-school Micro which was acidic Breaks. In his hey-day Micro would uplift you while screwing your brain up for 74 minutes straight and this CD was Micro in his hey-day. I would recommend it to anyone who owns or has listened to his Tech-Mix Series or Coast-to-Coast
2,Very attracttive phone but very poor range.,I am very disappointed with the range for this phone. I am unable to walk around my home and have a conversation on the phone because I get cut off then get a message OUT OF RANGE.I have used cordless phones that cost less than $50 that has more range than this phone.I wish I could get my money back so that I purchase the radio shack two line cordless.
2,Missing some critical items,"This phone has some nice features but missing some important quality. Issue number one: in order to avoid static on the phone line the base unit must be plugged directly into wall socket (per their techies). If you are like me and work from home, hence the need for 2 phone lines then you probably have lots of electronics and not enough wall sockets. The phone really sounds like you are on a 1950's party line when plugged into a standard electrical strip. Issue number 2: you can't turn off or down the intercom ring! Crucial in order to call my husband in the other room. The ring is loud and very annoying. Why when they have all the other ring options this was left off? Issue number 3: the microphone is extremely weak, every person I talk with, EVERY one says can you speak up. No way to do business.So if you don't mind these issue go for it."
4,MAYBE the best phone I've ever owned,"Bought this one because I'm wireless on my computer system, and my 2.4 GhZ wireless phone was causing lots of interference/lost connections, etc. As soon as I hooked up the new system, all wireless connectivity problems are gone!Sound quality and features on new phone are great. Only ""drawback:"" Buttons are pretty close together, and my eyesight isn't the best. But I figure I've only had phone 3 weeks or so, and once I get used to where everything is, this won't be a problem any longer.Bottom line: For the price, as well as the ability to add (VERY CHEAPLY!) extra handsets...which I've already done...you cannot go wrong with this phone"
3,Great phone -- apart from feedback on line 2,"This is by far the best cordless phone I have owned, apart from one problem that I could not live with. I had to return the phone because of excessive voice feedback on line 2.Other reviewers have mentioned this feedback, and one found that exchanging the unit fixed the problem. Not for me: while trying to exchange it I tested four identical units in different local retail stores. All exhibited exactly the same problem: your own voice comes through distractingly in the earpiece on line 2 (it's most noticeable with the volume turned up). In contrast, line 1 works perfectly.I am trying to get a response from Uniden on this, and will add an update if they fix the problem."
1,Terrible Range and Reception,"The handset developed static and went ""out of range"" from the base from one end of my house to the other ... my house is not that big. For this kind of money I expect clear reception. By contrast, the 5.8 GHz GE phone I just picked up for $29.99 has only very slight static and maintains reception all through my house.As others have said, there is very little choice in 2-line 5.8 GHz phones ... Panasonic, Motorola, this Uniden, and Radio Shack which looks like is it this Uniden rebranded. I have not tried the others, but other users' comments seem to echo the problems of this one. Rather than buy a multi-line expandable phone for over $200, I have decided to simply buy 3 separate inexpensive 5.8 GHz phones for about $100 total until someone perfects this technology and/or more competitors enter the field."
2,Beware----no chain dialing,"Overall this is good phone. However it does not support chain dialing. If you check the manual on Uniden's website it says that chain dialing is supported. However, after I bought the phone, charged the battery for 20 hours and tried the chain dialing process in the manual...it fails to work. The instructions tell you to press the ""phonebook"" key after speed dialing the first number. The problem is that the ""phonebook"" and ""mute"" are a shared key. Once you've connected via the first speed dial the ""phonebook"" key is disabled and goes into mute mode. I confirmed this with the Uniden helpline."
1,BAAAAAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Like the phone up to a couple of days ago.I try to make a call and I cannot get it off recording.No Dial Tone. The suggestions in the trouble shootingmanual dont work and when I tried to call customer service,I get a revolving message that leads nowhere.After 20 minutes, I was able to get a hold of a repair tech.But was placed on hold again for a person that could help mewith this problem.Maybe I just dont understand the instructions, I don't know.But I do know that CUSTOMER SERVICE DOESNT EXIST.GOOD LUCK TO ANYONE THAT MAY REQUIRE THEIR ASSISTANCE."
2,TRU 8866 5.8GHZ 2 line cordless phone,"I Just recieved this new phone. Features & Audio Quality are very Good. There is a little bit of echo as described by other Buyers. But my biggest complaint is the range. I only get about 40-50 ft. at best before this phone starts breaking up. Verydissapointed in the range of it in my house. My old uniden 900 SST went a block in a half for rang. This phone barely makes it out to my back Yard. If all the new 5.8 GHZ. are this way, thengive me the 900 Mhz. anyday of the Week. I hope Uniden & othermanufacturers are paying attention. Bob S."
1,lousy sound and limited range,"Feature-wise, this is a nice system. Cool display, nice feel, useful features (e.g. Do not disturb, Room monitor, Direct link, 2-line support). However, the SOUND QUALITY (via handset) is VERY POOR, and RANGE is VERY LIMITED (voice begins to breakup long before ""Out of range"" occurs). These two shortcomings render the phone a useless piece of junk. Good thing is that I can return it to the store.It's amaizing how time goes by, but phone manufacturers keep churning out crappier and crappier phones. And they are not cheap either. Shame on them."
2,"Good Features, Disappointing Range and Sound Quality","This phone did not work out as well as I had hoped and I ended up returning it. I really wanted a 2-line system and one that wounldn't interfere with my wireless network. The Uniden had lots of nice features, but I noticed the sound started to breakup when I walked upstairs, less than 20 feet from the base station. When I took it into my backyard (one of the reasons I went for 5.8GHz), the signal was even worse, even though I was less than 50 feet away. The sound quality didn't seem good either - even in my living room, next to the base station, it sounded tinny. I'm still looking for a 2-line phone. I'm considering the Panasonic, but notice that it's not too highly rated either."
1,Handset dead,The handset to the unit was DOA. Not a battery problem. Ordered an additional handset and that one would not take numbers in memory.
2,Sort of works,Got the refurbished product on time. I already had the same product I was using and part of it stopped working. Got this one but the main phone will not hold a charge. The base unit works great. Combined my now two units and everything works now. I probably should have just shelled out for newer technology.
2,Terrible Speakerphone,"I have this phone and have had it for 3-4 months; I find the speaker phone to be terrible. I find that the volume cuts in and out and people cannot hear you and you cannot hear people. The problem is that this is inconsistant so on some calls it works fine but on most it does not. If you are looking for a good cordless phone, this one is great but as for a speakerphone you are better off opening the window and yelling"
2,Poor sound quality,"I purchased this phone based upon several good reviews, but the sound quality makes it a loser. It is difficult to understand the person talking on the other end, and having purchased it from an online vendor I am stuck with it. I will use it as a backup phone but it certainly cannot garner my regular phone status."
1,Poor Range,"Static even when 5 feet away from base-station. Not sure if its the construction of the house, but the range is also very poor. Awaiting return."
1,never received items,"After requesting my two items to be sent to a new address, I have yet to receive my order."
1,2 BAD FEATURES,"Phone worked well out of box however compared to ATT 2 problems1) cannot turn off answering machine, longest option is 6 rings which is not enough in my household; ATT phone has option of turning off answering machine.2) when returning CID calls; long distance numbers start with area code xxx-xxxx not 1-xxx-xxxx this means you have to write down number to return call; ATT gives option to scroll down; if CID is xxx-xxxx you can scroll to a menu that allows you to save or call back as 1-xxx-xxxx;more than just a minor annoyance."
5,Uniden TRU8866,This is a wonderful item. We now use 4 handsets. The only problem is it likes lightening. We have had to replace our base a couple of time. There is no interference with other items or when both lines are in use.
2,Good but for one claring problem,"I purchased this phone to replace the Uniden EXI-7926 and like the other reviewers, was mostly satisfied and able to overlook some basic ease of use quirks. That was, until I noticed that the phone is unable to detect that a line is in use from a non Uniden phone. My primary reason for having 2 lines is so my wife can be on a call in the other room (from a non Uniden phone) and I can see this on the base or handset and choose to use the 2nd line without picking up and disturbing her call. I thought that this was the most basic of 2-line features. I guess Uniden thinks otherwise. Oh well, this one is going back."
4,"Functions well, but too cutsie","The Uniden Power max 5.8 GHz 2-line phone is pretty good. Range in my concrete-walled office is very limited, but voice quality very good, and functionality very good. Pet peeves: phone book can't be transmitted from base station to hand units, so every number has to be reentered into each unit; buttons too small; location of button finctions is too randome and not intuitive; no dual-ring defeat option to turn off fax line running off line 2; speaker phone not full duplex, so start of all conversations is clipped; illuminated display turns off too soon. Likes: good speaker sound; clear display when light is on."
5,Excellent for home or small office,"After reading all the reviews on various 5.8 GHz phones, I decided upon the TRU8866 and two additional handsets. I am very happy with the quality of these phones, but more importantly the sound quality is excellent. It is very clear and no more interference from my 802.11g data network. It also has a do-not-disturb (DND) feature which is great if you want uninterrupted sleep during the day or night. This model does not have a built in answering system. I did not need a answering system because I use my phones in combination with an Asterisk PBX that hosts my voicemail. When a voicemail message is left on the Asterisk system it triggers the Message Waiting Indicator (MWI) on these Uniden TRU8866 phones. The MWI also works with voicemail services offered by most Telco's"
3,OK 2 line phone,The sound quality is the main issue with this phone. It is not always clear and can sound hollow. This was however the cheapest 2 line cordless phone around (all others around twice as much). Might spend more next time.
4,Worth the price,I bought this phone 2 months for use in India and didn't realize (before I purchased the phone) this works on 110/120v. Fortunately a transformer did the trick.The phone is compact and neat looking. The only thing I didn't like (so far) is that the display color on the phone is a horrific red. Usually displays are a mellow color (orange or light green).Good phone at a good price.
5,Great phone system!,"I paid a considerable amount of money for this phone system, but it was worth every penny. The phone (handsets) are small enough to put in my pocket. I always use a headset, so I walk around with the phone in my pocket and the headset on my head. I can look up phone numbers I've stored in the phonebook (within the phone). The phone is very clear. I can hear, and people can hear me with no static or interference.The Uniden TRU 8866 is an excellent phone system. The only thing that worries me is that phones become obsolete so quickly, I am afraid lightning might hit my base and then I would lose ALL my extension phones; so I bought ANOTHER base (which I'm storing for an emergency). If my first base dies, I will just plug the other one in, re-set my extensions and keep going. I've used these phones for over a year, and so far I haven't found anything negative to report. It gets a 5 star rating from me.Sherry Bailey"
1,Unisar Portable MiniFridge,"Compact feature is great, but if you need to depend on it for a constant temperature, forget it."
1,Dysfunctional and Expensive to me.,"This product failed to work, at all. In trying to effect a return, I discovered that I would have to pay for the return postage, pay for a proof of receipt, and pay a ""restocking fee"" of 20%. I fail to comprehend this restocking fee. Do they plan to ""resell"" this non-working item? This was an expensive experience, on my part."
1,"Received Two, Both Stopped Working In Under One Month","After the first fridge stopped working in under a month, the second we received as a replacement stopped working within a month as well. Was used to store baby bottles. I do not recommend this product."
1,This fridge breaks down quickly.,"This fridge stopped working after three weeks, allowing the contents to spoil. I wish I had seen all the other reviews here reporting the same outcome. Not worth the money or hassle."
2,Mini Fridge... BIG HEADACHE!,I was all excited about this mini fridge using it for my work desk. I wanted it basically to keep my insulin cool. It worked great for about a one week then gave out!!! I even read one of the reviews where it died about 2months later but I didn't listen... I should of and saved my time and headache. I say take a look at another one-- don't buy this one unless you want to use it for short periods of time or plan to toss it after 2 months of use.
1,Quit working after a month,Bought this for work. I'm a working mom that expresses breast milk through out the day. This item seemed great though cheaply made. Suddenly stopped working after only a month. Don't waste your money.
2,has potential to be good,"I just bought this fridge for use with camping.(yes, some campsites have electric!)Well, I mostly want it for meat and dairy, but the unit could only chill down to @46 degrees F. While this is adequate for water and soda, it won't keep the dairy very fresh beyond a day. the specs say it can cool to 38F but we weren't able to see that even after 12 hours using a digital thermometer to measure the temperature. seems the back of the fridge gets chilled, but the front part of it is not part of the cooling element or chamber, but just insulation. So, I probably will return it since I am not convinced it is adequate for dairy. It took at least hour to chill the box down from a room temperature start. This fridge is very small, so once the door is opened, it takes a bit for the box to recover its chill."
3,"Doesn't really keep stuff cold, but it's cute and small","It's a small fridge that will better insulate things for a short period of time rather than leaving them out to get to room temperature. Dont count on it to cool things off or keep things cool, but it's cute, cheap and works for temporary use."
1,Is This a Fridge or a Warmer?,"I have purchased one of these mini fridge during the heat of the past summer to keep a couple cans of my favorite Starbucks Espresso drinks & a candy bar or 2 in hand by my recliner when I'm watching TV & surfing the net. When it was time for my snack, I found my coffee drinks warm & my candy bars melted!! I double checked the switches on the back, I did put it on ""COOL"" not ""WARM"". So I just give up using it & bought myself another one by Koolatron! It turned out it was a wise move because my new Koolatron mini fridge cooled down to about 38F in less than 5 mins after I plug it into the wall! I have wasted my $45 of my hard earn money!! Please take my advice, DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS PIECE of JUNK!!"
3,It is OK,"The fridge works, but is a little noisy. Feels a little clunky when you close the door. Using it in the baby nursery and it fits four small bottles, but he tall bottle will not fit with the nipple and cover (fits only with a travel cover)"
3,Works Just OK,"This refrigerator is very small, light weight and portable. Total capacity is 6 12 oz cans. I have not tried the refrigerator on the warming mode. On the cold mode the refrigerator will maintain something that is already cold but you will not get an icy cold beverage from this fridge. It probably gets to the low 40's at best even in a room cooler than 70 degrees. For what I use it for, to keep my already cool beverages cool, its adequate. If it was able to cool below 40 degrees I might go to 4 stars but beware that the fan on this unit runs continuously since is does not use refrigerant. The fan noise is about the same as a big computer."
3,Good little fridge,"Got it for baby bottles, it doesn't run loudly and keeps everything plenty cool. If you live somewhere humid you'll have to let it defrost every few days but it only takes a couple minutes for the ice to fall off. I used it continuously but it only lasted 9 months then died."
2,"Probably not designed for continuous use, dead after 3 months","I am not sure that this product is designed for continuous use. I've seen a few reviews here from others that stated that it worked okay for a few months and then died. This seems to have been my case as well.My miniFridge, while it was working, could cool to about 50 degrees. But it would vary greatly depending on the temperature around it. I would be careful keeping something perishable in here. But for keeping soda cool on a trip(they include a car adapter), its probably fine, and takes up much less space than a packed ice chest.I had high hopes for it. But for 3 months, it kept the contents mostly cool(50-60 deg), which I was only mildly happy with, and now its dead."
1,Desktop Frig Lasted only 1 month,"Bebe Sounds Portable MiniFridgeI do computer work at home. Purchased this frig in an attempt to keep drinks cool while working. First, it was much louder than I had anticipated. It did not keep drinks cool enough and it stopped working completely 1 month after I bought it. BAD PURCHASE!"
4,best office fridge on the planet,My office partner and I needed a fridge to keep coffee cream cold which liberated us from the powdered palm oil substitute. This MiniFridge is the best thing since sliced bread and it looks just like a miniature fridge. Now we are looking for a miniature table with chairs to complete the kitchen look on the window sill (engineers with too much time on their hands).
3,works well under right conditions,"The earphone (hearing) worked well. I see several reviews that talked about poor fit. You have to work to get this thing seated correctly. It IS uncomfortable if you seat it incorrectly or use the wrong size earpiece. The microphone also works poorly if it doesn't seat solidly in your ear. I suspect some people don't follow directions (insert, then twist and make sure that the top part of earpiece is OUTSIDE your ear structure). The microphone is very sensitive and picks up your voice well (if seated correctly) but it also picks up noise very well. I drive a mini-van that has fair amount of road noise on highway. I returned mine to try the Jabra mini-boom model. Same good fit and sound, but the microphone picks up less noise. I'm happier with the mini-boom. A bonus is that it is half the cost of the earset model."
3,Nokia earset,"Much more comfortable than earbud sets. Transmission is very clear, without need for separate mike. Biggest problem is that the gel earpieces fall off constantly."
2,Poor instructions and design problems,"I bought the Jabra set to use with my Nokia 5160 phone. As far as I could tell, the sound quality was acceptable, but there are two things to keep in mind:1) The plastic ear inserts not only would not fit comfortably in my ear (one hurt because it was too big, the next size down wouldn't stay in my ear). Further, the plastic inserts kept falling off the speaker!2) There are no helpful instructions to help you figure out which of the inserts are for the right and which for the left ear. You have to experiment. There isn't even instruction on how to insert them in your ear properly."
2,Not as good as I had hoped.,"This was the exact item I had been looking for and could not find in the stores where I was shopping. I read other people's reviews that said how much they loved it. Only one said they didn't. I couldn't wait to get it. Well the love quickly died. I had trouble with the ear pieces. One seem too big and the next size seem too small. I could hear people great, but they had trouble hearing me. They said I sounded far away. I let my wife use it and I listened to her and sure enough she didn't sound all that great. Major disappointment. Maybe it works for some people but not for me."
1,Buzzes like a bumblebee on steroids,"CAVEAT EMPTOR - This thing buzzes like a bumblebee on steroids. Not even worth 10 bucks, let alone the 40 I paid at Radio Shed.I would only use this thing under the following 2 conditions:1) it was given to me free; and2) it was the only earset available (i.e., avoiding brain tumors).Otherwise, AVOID THIS EARSET AT ALL COSTS!!!"
2,Rather Disappointing,I ordered this particular headset because of the three sizes of earpieces. My ears are smallish and I was excited to think Jabra had solved my problem. On the contrary. The smallest earpiece is still uncomfortably large for my ear.Then there's the background buzz. I don't really care to spend my cell minutes listening to my friends complain about sound quality! I'll be trying something else.
1,The other party cannot hear you with this device,"I could hear just fine with this device, but the other partycannot hear you. I fiddled with the little mike (which isattached to the earpiece) but couldn't improve quality. Ileft myself voice mail at home and cell phone to check quality -the words are unintelligible on the message.Also, the little alligator clip that is I guess supposed tokeep the wire from getting tangled broke the first time I used it.The earpiece fit fine and did not give me a problem."
2,Jabra EarSet for Nokia phones,"This product would be great if it were durable. Over time, it started to sound like I was talking into a can. I could barely hear what the other party was saying. Too bad - it was comfortable and worked well for three months."
1,"Good start, bad finish","`When I first bought this item, it worked great, but over time it became harder and harder to hear. Several others I have spoken to have had similar results which is sad because it would be a great product if it were more durable."
1,Didn't work for me,"Fiddle as I may, the other party cannot seem to hear me clearly. I own other Jabra earsets, but this one just didn't work. ..."
2,better books out there,"Overall not a bad cookbook but I think that there are better cake cookbooks out there. I much prefer the Cake Mix Doctor cookbook by Ann Byrn along the same lines and here's why. There is a picture of every cake, something that is missing in this book. Also there are recipes for homemade frosting, glazes etc instead of just instructing you to use canned frosting. Just a little something more to give it the ""homemade"" feel."
2,Horrible Transaction,"I ordered this book, paid my hard earned money and I did not receive it. Wish I had a way to contact the seller. I guess that's what I get for buying used. Horrible experience. How do I get this resolved?!"
3,Not quite up to snuff,"The item arrived with a hole or bad seam that let the seed content leak out. We tried it anyways to see if it would suit. It takes several minutes in the microwave to get warm, and the ""cape"" design causes it to slide down the back if you are sitting upright. I had hoped for a neck band with a few inches of extension to cover just the upper back and shoulders.Also, the smell is a bit much, although that would probably fade with time?"
2,so-so heat pack,this heat pack does not hold its heat as well as others I have had. Also although it appears in the picture that it is sewn in sections it is not. As a result the material inside slides to the bottom making it uneven if you try and use it sitting upright. I'm also not nuts about the aroma.
4,calamity jane is a fun book,"her missteps are fun and entertaining next to the more competent male character. the character that surround her are fun too and play her up well. it was a fun and easy read. after reading this book, i went to see if it was a series and it is. it looks to be a little like evonovich and she has an off and on again thing going between two men. i dont want to play that game again, so i am going to pass on the series, but reading the discription of the other books, if i wanted to play the back and forth, this looks to be a good series."
5,What a fun book!,I laughed until I had tears in my eyes at some things. A good mystery humor mix. Hard to put down!
4,Good,Very good the character's took hold of the story and ran with it.Will read more by this author any time.
4,I really enjoyed this book!,I read the second book first but it was so good it made me want to read this one. i like the not quite so perfect heroine and her penchant for trouble. Good lighthearted fun!
2,I didn't finish it,"I started this thinking it was a clean book and for some misguided reason, I equated clean with no swear words. It was silly of me, and I didn't get far into this book before I gave up on reading swear words and half finished blond jokes. So, although it might have been an awesome book, I deleted it. I'm tired of having to endure swear words to enjoy a book."
5,"A real cute love story, masked with a comedy","This book had me rolling most of the time. Such a slap ur head kinda girl, she's just one mishap after the other. This is definately a must read. She's just a down home kinda girl who can't seem to do anything right. Plus she seems to be the town joke and no one takes her seriously. One of the downsides of living in a small town, lol. She finally gets hers and people now take her seriously and look at her in a new light. Would be a great character to build a series off of."
5,Reminds me of Plum,"This book is well written, plot moves at a good pace, and the characters are like-able and well-developed. The mystery part is written so that the antagonist isn't obvious, the romance is believable, and the comedy is plausible. This reminds me of a well-written Evanovich novel and I highly recommend it. I hope the author continues this series!"
5,Clamity Jayne,"Once I picked this book up and started reading, I couldn't put it down. This is a funny yet kept me guessing who did it. Kind of reminds me of the Stephanie Plum series, but without two hunks. This was a quick read, one day and the author kept you on your toes. You could feel the characters feelings and associate with them. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a quick, fun mystery book. Can't wait till the next one comes out."
5,A great read.,"Infused with tasteful humor, this book provided a great story that kept me on edge and wanting to read more! As this is my first venture into the Calamity Jayne Mysteries, I can't wait to find out what other situations this oh-so-relatable character gets herself into."
4,easy entertainment,A light quick humorous read - liked the characters and how they played their parts. Interesting how Calamity gets into and out of tricky situations!
5,Amazing,"I absolutely fell in love with this book, maybe it was its similarity it the Stephanie plum series, or maybe I just like the formula of the cozy mystery but this got big thumbs up from me."
4,Enjoyable read. Kept me laughing.,"This was a very good story, told in a style that keeps the reader chuckling. I loved the characters, and found they were well drawn. I didn't guess the ending either.The misuse of ""prospective"" for ""perspective"", and ""affect"" for ""effect"", were minor glitches that didn't slow me down much. I appreciated the nearly perfect editing, which is not always found in free books. I do highly recommend this author and look forward to reading more of her work."
4,quick and entertaining read,loved this book. quick read and quirky characters. a little romance and a lot of mystery. really enjoyed reading this book and looking forward to finishing the series.
5,Enjoyable read!!,laugh out loud circumstances w/ good mystery and entertaining storyline. Awaiting the next adventure and I'm sue it'll be a doozy!
5,love it,"Please make more this is a great book. Can't get enough of this wonderful girl, a must read for every one."
5,great new author!,"This is a fantastic, incredibly funny book - I absolutely recommend it! The dialogue between Tressa ""Calamity"" Jayne Turner and her childhood nemisis, Ranger Rick Townsend is hilarious and their chemistry is irresistable. I can't wait for the next book in this series."
2,couldn't finish,I could not ever get going with this. Just seemed to never make any point. Didn't like the characters. Just not my cup of tea.
4,She's kinda inept,"but still pretty endearing. I do wish Jayne's conversations wouldn't all consist of her asking others a dozen questions without taking a breath, or waiting for an answer. Seriously, what kind of reporter does that? However, her personality is buoyant and the author hints at all kinds of crazy adventures/incidents and accidents in Jayne's past so she's a fun girl to hang out with."
5,Wonderful!,"Loved this book. A ""not regular"" type girl who wants the same thing in life that other girls want but things just don't work out like a fairy-tail. It is a great book to read, makes you laugh, makes you wonder, glad you read it at the end. Want more Calamity."
4,Great book,This book really keeps your mind going. It is a who done it book for sure. I. Would recommend this book to everyone. Man or woman.
3,Fun to read,"If you are ready for a few laughs, this is a good book to read. This reminds me of the Janet Evanovich books because it's about a not-so-competent girl that has to solve mysteries. Kathleen Bacus has written other books and I intend to read them."
4,Calamity Jane,I enjoyed reading the book. Poor Calamity Jane sure holds true to her name. I wanted to keep reading to find out just what was going to happen to her.
2,Save yourself the time...do not read,The main character was so incompetent and clueless for someone who was supposed to be an adult it was ridiculous. Being a little spacey might be endearing but she was portrayed as an idiot. I seldom don't finish a book but this one was too silly for me to even care what happened.
3,Decent Story. Unpleasant Writing Style,I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book would be better without the narrator. This writing style is really annoying and ruins an otherwise enjoyable book.
2,Narrator is in the way!,"I finished the book DESPITE the annoying first-person narration which distracted from the story. It was okay, but reining in the continuous comments, references, and non-stop blabbing would have made the story much more enjoyable. Glad it was on the free list!"
3,Calamity Jayne,"I found it very simple reading and except for the age of the characters, would be good reading for teens. Delete some of the graphic scenes and sexual content and the writer would be good for teen readers."
3,"Downloaded for free,","This is the first book that I downloaded on the Kindle app. It was free and I used it to test out my device. I pretty much enjoyed the book. It's a quick, easy read.The book's main character is Tressa Jayne Turner. She's working two part time jobs, lives in a trailer on her parent's property, and drives a car that is on the verge of falling apart. Everyone discounts her as a ""airhead blonde"". She has a love/hate relationship with her brother's best friend, Ranger Rick.One night, after working both jobs, her car breaks down while driving home. She discovers a dead body in the trunk and an envelope filled with money in the glove box. She runs for help and runs into Ranger Rick. They come back to the car and the body is gone along with the money. Then she realizes that it isn't her car.We follow her journey where the police don't believe her, her life is being threatened, and she keeps finding dead bodies."
2,Enough already!,"The best thing about this book is that it does have funny moments and the plot is a good idea. HOWEVER, oh my gawd! The heroine's stupidity (supposed to be charming), got VERY old and went on way too long. Not funny. I got bored with all the Lucille-Ball-badly-done antics, gave up about halfway through and skipped to the end, something i've only done one other time in my life. I don't think i missed a thing by skipping half the book."
3,"Ho, Hum....Boring","Someone, please tell me why anyone would portray the female lead character (usually in her mid-twenties) as having a brain not yet fully developed. Tressa, a.k.a Calamity Jayne, is just such a character. Jayne finds a dead body in the trunk while driving home one night and doesn't even realize that it is not her car that she is driving. After searching for help and returning to the car, the body is gone. Jayne is now on a mission to solve this mystery, putting herself into either stupid or silly situations, all in the course of one week. This became tiresome and boring really fast. I rated this a three instead of a two only because some of what she is thinking is actually funny."
4,Kept my interest,I enjoyed this story although it was a little hard to follow at times but fun to read. I think you will enjoy.
3,Not bad for a freebie,Not too bad for a free read. Too many clichéd phrases and attempts at sounding fancier than what it is. Plot line was interesting and protagonist was endearing.
3,A fun read,"For the most part, this book is grammatically correct; unfortunately, it does have a plethora of mistakes, which brings the rating of the novel down.I don't want to give away any of the details of this story so as not to ruin it for the next reader. It is reputed to be full of dumb-blonde jokes, but is also chuck-full of clichés; too many for my taste. The book made me laugh aloud more than once, not in derision, but with humor, and that speaks volumes. The author was imaginative with her creation of scenes and kept you wondering what would happen next.I give this book 3.5 stars."
5,cute,Very good story! Jane is such a character. I love reading about her adventures. I can't wait to read more!
3,"Cute, Quick & Easy","Thought this was a really cute book. I like the characters and the snarky remarks back and forth between the Townsend men and Tressa. There were parts where she droned on in her head a bit too much, but overall it was a cute book. I will read more of Calamity Jane's adventures."
4,Calamity jayne,This was a cute suspense thriller that would be a great for a lot of age groups and reading preferences
4,Like the character,I liked the character of Calamtiy Jayne though I don't think I could take anymore of her adventures by reading more books as it would get into the annoying stage.
5,Great book!,"I worried this would be a sappy romance novel but it ended up being more of a whimsical mystery. Definitely kept my attention, even had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion."
2,Irritating and a big let down,Okay while the story line was outrageous it could still be believable but the whole first person take time to make comments and over use of the nickname and side comments made this book irritating then in the end the biggest let down of all. Why have a hot guy in the story if they are not going to get together. I was shocked to see there are more but don't have the patience to read them as this was annoyed me.
2,disapointed,"Couldn't get into this book. Basically a narration of the character telling the reader how everyone picks on her because she is blonde. Found myself skipping pages just to find dialogue between characters and that was quite short. Writing showed promise in that character almost came across as amusing, but fell just short. I did not even chuckle once and read several chapters. It was obvious from the beginning Jayne would end up with the Ranger. I was not willing to finish the book to prove myself correct. Less narrating and allowing the storyline/dialogue to make the story would have been better."
2,Jaime Pressly movie for sure,"Good, not great. Fart parts were good. Needs more sex though. 34B boobs are my favorites. Too much mushy mush"
3,Have not read it yet,"Although downloaded I have not read it yet, so I have no opinion yet on it will let you know"
4,ok read that holds your interest,"This book was okay, the storyline was good, I was not really a fan of Jayne herself, it was one of those things as your reading along and she is just so dumb talking in the book that your thinking in your head OMG DUH just say it already, be clear. There was alot of that in this book. Still not really sure if she is just dumb or just plays dumb. How can you reason out a murder investigation but accidentally get in the wrong car and not notice? Thats why I don't care for the main character all that much, if she's smart enough to reason through a murder, she can damn well realize its not her car shes driving, among other REALLY dumb things in the book. There were some really funny parts, thats what held my interest, and the mystery plot. the four stars are for the comedy of it, it was funny."
3,They were just okay,"Overall, the socks weren't bad, but I was hoping they would be taller. I thought they were knee-highs but they only reached my mid-calf. They were also quite thick for a midweight sock. The color was great! It's hard to judge based on a computer image, but this one was quite accurate. The cardinal red was dark, deep red - exactly what I was looking for."
3,Too tight,"These socks are very narrow and the elastic is extremely tight.I'm a small guy with thin legs, so if they're this tight on me imagine what they would be like on your average person.I threw them out because they were too tight to wear comfortably."
2,Velma socks,"The color was deceiving. We had to buy another pair of socks. The quality of the socks were fine, just the color."
1,Bleech!,"Yuck! On every track, the singing is really very awful. If not for that, it would have been decent. If I had heard it before I bought it, I never would have spent 2 cents on it. In fact, if this CD was being handed out for free on the streets, I'd turn it down.Would someone please recommend some good Euro Dance? Other albums I bought recently which I enjoyed were Eiffel 65 and Aqua. Thanks!"
4,Appeals to the inner pirate,"This is an interesting book for one reason in particular. It is the only first person account of submarine warfare I know that was written by an enlisted sailor in the navy. It's well written a good story and shouldn't take long to finish.This book centers more on the personal triumphs of the people on board the submarine and less on the strategy of submarines in the war. All in all, a great account of their war patrols.As a radio nut I think it's particularly interesting that the author was a radio man in the service. I can't think of a book written by anyone in the service who played a role in radio service. As a result of mission he was in a key position to observe everything that was going with the ship and its place in history.If you liked this book you might like to find War in the Boats, Wahoo, Clear the Bridge, and Silent Running by Calvert."
4,"""Nothing Friendly in the Vicinity..."", a Swell Read","Claude Conner's account of his experiences as a submariner and the history of the great submarine he crewed on during the second world war is a fascinating account of what that exciting and fearful life was really like. He tells of the great commanding officers and their triumphs and frustrations, and of the unfortunate mistake hinted at in the title of the book. I found this truthful and rather fascinating book difficult to put down until I had finished it. I can highly recommend it."
4,cable,"Transaction went well, shipping was on time. Wish the cable was black not blue, but that is fine. Would like more info about cables on the site. The prices are all over the map and I cant be sure if I am getting more if I pay more. Overall, v. good."
4,Great movie,"This was a wonderfully directed movie, I don't know why it didn't do so well in the US. The actors did a splendid job, the music was great, and the plot was good. It would appeal to mostly women I think, as a dark drama from the iew-point of a woman."
2,crazy wierd lady,Keep away from that girl at all costs. Scenery is magnificent. Plot is crazy and so is the main character Dina. Mads is brilliant in his short allowance of scenes.
2,Never buy a CD after listening to one track!!! Duh!,"OK, OK - so I admit I made the age old mistake of hearing the Black Eyes track off this CD and automatically judged the album GREAT! Well kids...not so much. It is obvious why the Black Eyes track is the single most heard off the album; it sounds like they spent WAY more time honing their craft on that one track than the whole album.Moment of honesty - should have just bought the single and left the rest alone. Not to say the rest of the album is a waste! It just wasn't what I expected. My bad! I accept full responsibility for being lazy."
5,Haven't been able to put this CD down...,"I first heard Snowden when a local radio DJ played ""Black Eyes."" I was instantly intrigued and bought the album shortly thereafter. Upon hearing it, I wasn't sure what to think. It was unlike any other band I've heard; infectious basslines, energetic drumming, and endearing, though somewhat off-key vocals.Comparisons can be made with Interpol, but I find Snowden to be more upbeat and catchy. Whereas Interpol has more of a minimalist sound, Snowden simply has more sound, period.The album quickly grew on me to the point where the CD never left my player, and 6 months later I still listen to it regularly. Anti-Anti is, in my mind, the best album of 2006."
1,"scanner ok, software not","I have a Microtek scanner and just downloaded the latest drivers. It turns out Microtek wants a program called Scan Finder to load at every start-up, and there is no way to disable this. The product works satisfactorily, but for my money, I will purchase something else. Something that doesn't create such a nuisance, and isn't so invasive."
5,Nice equipment - software??,"The scanner hardware has been excellent and functions as advertised. The acompaning software is another story, if not for Adobe Photoshop being included I may well still trying to figure out the software. Most of which I still have not used - everything is done with Photoshop."
4,Light and Fun,"What if a band of space faring aliens landed in medieval Europe and were overrun as they debarked from there ship by the local baron and his merry band of knights and serfs. What if these same medieval simpletons were then to take this ship to the nearest colony world of this alien power, guided by a captive alien. Imagine the fun and utter destruction that would ensue.This is a light and fun novel that explores completely ludicrous what ifs but is enjoyable nonetheless. The book is not written in a joking manner but the humor shines through as we see what farcical destruction a band of barbarians can wreck on a truly advanced race. A good quick read that should be read as the light fare that it is."
3,A hilarious tour-de-farce! Anderson rocks!,"This old ""classic"" is a great tour-de-farce that Anderson masterfully keeps just on the edge of plausibility. The premise is simple. A highly advanced alien spaceship, from the ""Wersgor Empire"" lands on Earth with the intent of subjigating it. The time is the 14th Century, the place, England.Well, the local horse cavalry surprises and overwhelms the aliens and takes control of the spaceship. The Englishmen then proceed to take on the whole Wersgor Empire by guts, guile, and good old human deviousness. This all makes for great fun. This is a terrific ""beer and chips"" novel, which is all Anderson, a Grand Master of SF, intended for it to be. I only gave it three stars because this is not great literature, nor is it the best that Anderson has written. But make no mistake, this one gets 5 stars in the category of readability and fun, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Science Fiction and has a good sense of humor. Enjoy."
3,"Entertaining adventure, short on depth.","When aliens decide to add Earth to their list of conquered worlds, they get more than they bargained for upon landing in medieval England. The colorful warriors of the day not only defend their lands valiantly, they decide to turn the tables. The main problem I had with this story is how easily the medieval humans became comfortable with the alien situation, considering the hundreds of years it took humans to cope with new ideas at that time. Just another day at the castle, here, it seems. Otherwise very entertaining and colorful writing. Recommended overall."
3,Enjoyable easy read,"Far from sophisticated writing, but an enjoyable read nonetheless. Simple plot and simple characters prevent me from giving it 5 stars, but a sufficiently interesting premise that I recommend it as light reading."
4,Great Fun,"High Crusade is as a novel is great fun. More serious than Douglas Adams but still satirical and funny, this novel captures the feel of the concept: ""What if the medieval English went to outer space?""From the opening chapter you know how this book will go, but it is the little things that make it a fun gem:""You need not fear the demons if you are God fearing men!"" yelled Sir Roger. ""But we are miserable sinners!"" quailed a man in the back (note the above was a paraphrase as I do not have the book handy. The actual quote is likely much more vibrant. But this is memory, such a subjective thing)In any case, if you want to read a novel that follows your classic fantasy (fight the bad guy, conquer the kingdom), has a bit of a love story and many funny sequences, this is a highly recommended book. Just not a thinking novel."
1,creed,The item seems completely fake and it smelled not like a creed perfume. I finished returning the two i bought.
2,everything here is better somewhere else,"There is one reason I do not like this album: the drumming of Roy Haynes. I am no drumming expert, but I know what sounds good to me. Elvin Jones sounds good, but he was unavailable to Trane at the time, so Haynes replaced him. Now, Haynes is supposed to be a great drummer, but his style clashes with Coltrane. Have you ever felt your heart kind of blip, as if there was a funny beat or a skipped beat? That is Haynes on this album. His snare drum sounds awful, and it keeps coming in at what sounds like the wrong moment. He utterly ruins I Want to Talk About You, which otherwise is every bit as beautiful as the verison on Live at Birdland. In fact, buy Live at Birdland instead of this record."
2,NOTHING MORE THAN PLEASANT,"I have a few tapes with Dorothy Kirsten singing two of her most famous operatic roles: 'Mimi' in ""La Boheme"" and the title role in ""Madama Butterfly."" Both are beautifully performed. This crossover album is certainly not as pathetic as the travesties produced for the great Joan Sutherland (Noel Coward songs) or Jessye Norman (Michel Legrand songs). Actually Kirsten's voice is perfectly fine. In fact, in the CD's liner notes, we're told that she started her career as a pop singer on the radio and this makes perfect sense. She has the sweet sound and lack of interpretive skills of a big band singer. The legendary Gershwin and Kern songs are simply sung pleasantly. Nothing more! The so-called ""tropical love songs"" are just a bit embarrassing, but then I cannot think of anyone besides Xavier Cugat who should perform them."
3,okay,"The actual glasses feel comfortable, but the yellow tint is annoying. The description says that the yellow/amber tint increases visibility, but I don't see how. It was just annoying. I prefer clear."
4,There is a fix for the battery life problem,"We experienced the same problems everybody else is reporting about the short battery life. But it turns out that if you clean the contacts on the battery, the springs, and on the bottom of the phone with alcohol, and insert some cardboard between the non-contact end of the battery and the wall of the battery compartment (thereby pushing the battery into the springs with more force), the battery problems go away. So, it's not the battery, charger, or power-management software--it's just a mechanical problem.With that problem fixed, this is an excellent phone system.(By the way, we're told that Uniden phones have excellent battery life.)"
4,Panasonic Model KX-TGA270S Cordless Phone Handset,"I have used many brands of cordless telephones and find the Panasonic Model KX-TGA2700 Expandable base and the Panasonic Model KX-TGA270S Cordless Phone Handset to be very good. I have not experienced any of the problems that Mr. Naduwilage has encountered, although I have not tried the headset feature.Overall, I have find the performance to be excellent, the features convenient and the price acceptable. I am ordering another handset today."
4,Good Phone,"The origianl phone I purchased had a problem with battery life. This one is and extension to a set we already own. No problems with it to date. Great for 3-level house, becuase we have a cordless on each level."
3,"poor, inconsisdent battery life","PRO:speaker phone. able to check message from extension. clear LCD display. clear sound. doesn't require phone jack. up to 8 extensions.CON:battery life.i bought a pack from costco, contains a base station and two extension phones. when new, two phone has different battery life, one can last more than 2hrs, the other barely 70 minutes. guess i should've return them.and after one year, the battery life of both just dropped dramatically. one of them (the good) is the worst. the battery life will drop after just 3 minutes, even when it is fully charged. this extension always lose connection with the base station.as others have suggested, i highly recommend you to replace it with batteries from GE or Energizer. it is a good phone."
4,"Had Battery Problems, but Found Easy Solution","I too like many other have experienced horrible battery problems with this phone. After some investigating, I found that the solution for my problem was inserting a piece of cardboard into the top of the battery compartment to forcibly push the battery against the springs. Since that, I have had no more charging problems."
1,affected all my other phones,"I ordered this phone as an extension for my base unit. I registered it and it worked fine for one day. The next day, all my phones were echoing and the new handset faded in and out and nobody could hear me on the new handset. I had to return it and deregister it, but my phones still haven't returned to the previous normal state. At this point, I don't know what to do."
4,No Need To Shout,Telephone reception is fine. The numbers separating this 2-line phone are so what small. I have not read the lengthy manual yet. It appears to have many features. Comfortable to hold. appearance goes great with my decor. We will probably purchase additional phones for other rooms in the house if this continues to perform well.
2,Battery is terrible,"I bought this phone along with the base unit and other extension telephones and for everyphone, the battery life is absolutely horrible. after being on the phone for 45 minutes, the battery needs to be charged for many hours just to use it again. I would not purchase any products in this line ever again."
2,Battery life problems,"It may be a fluke, but I have had battery problems with this phone. It was so bad that I could not complete a call without the phone discharging. I was very careful not to recharge the phone without the battery discharging so as not to decrease battery life. Still, this is the second phone I have gone through in less than a year. I have spent hours on the phone with Panasonic trying to fix the problem. Panasonic replaced the phone twice with refurbished models and still the battery life is horrible. We looked into having the settings wrong to just a bad battery. I am now trying the newer model with the NiMHd battery instead of the NiCd. Let's see how this works. I am very disappointed with the customer service offered by Panasonic. Warranty means that they will only replace the phone with a refurbished model. This is true even if the phone dies withing the first month."
1,Was this a case of bait and switch or an honest mistake?,I received the wrong phone. I contacted the seller. He advised me my shipment was mixed with someone elses and since mine was a better model he didn't expect the other buyer would return it. I found this odd being the phone systems were not compatible with the units that were sent. I'd like to think it was an honest mistake but I have my doubts. I did get my money back and I am grateful but I still need the phone.
2,not good...,"teh problem is that with multiple lines, you cannot be heard by the other party. It seems that I am always having to scream into the phone, to be heard. Save yourmoney and look elsewhere..."
2,Battery life is poor.,Battery life is terrible. They need a lithium ion battery for this phone. Get out of the old technology.
4,Panasonic Cordless Phone with 8 Extensions,This Panasonic phone is excellent. It allows up the 8 handsets with the base station (station 0) being the 9th extension. The system has a number of features including an intercom feature which is very useful. The system is hard to find. I was happy to see that I could get a replacement extension from Amazon. The only issue I've had with the phone is that their is no documentation on how to remove a handset. A call to the help line resolved this problem quickly. You need to know how to do this if you've got 8 handsets and one of them breaks and needs to be replaced. The phone still works after it's been dropped in the swimming pool but not well:-)!
4,Mines been fine!!,"I can sympathize with the people who have had battery problems, as I had to replace the battery in my KX-TG2730S base unit not to long after I bought it.I have had one of the KX-TGA270S extensions since last year and haven't had a problem with it. I'm going to be ordering 2 more.The only gripe I have about these phones is that I'm not crazy about the cheap looking silver paint (I don't like the white either), and I wish the directories were one button accessible."
3,Battery problems,"I have both the base phone and the KX-TGA270S unit, both purchased new within the last 4 months. I have had problems with both handsets when they were installed in the 270S charging unit. During several calls the battery has completely discharged causing the line to go dead. Other than this, I think this is an excellent phone."
5,If you use it wisely,"i was just reading the reviews on this panasonic Chordless phone system. I have owned this system for several years now and I have not had one bit of a problem. It is a great system, having good range, of course I don't chat for hours on end while on the phone either. ( If you are an extended chatter I suggest going to a chorded phone system!) The battery life has never caused an Issue with me. I realize Duh! that batteries do not last forever, so I use this product for short calls. for extended calls I use a wired phone. I also have a WiFi system and this phone has never interfered with the operation of the WiFi.On all I rate this Panasonic System superb!"
2,Handset is a problem...too many people say so...must be true?,No problem with the base station......But the Handset as others have reported is a a problem. The battery or recharging system appears to be of faulty design. There is no doubt that Panasonic has had a lot of calls re this product...Many people never complain.I will try the Metal Hydride battery as suggested in one of the posts.Panasonic is a very good company that makes excellent products....but some don't make it.
4,It's a great system,"We have the base unit and 4 additional stations for a total of five phones and have never had a problem with reception, quality, or interference with the wireless network at home.The only drawback is that it only holds 50 names & numbers in the address book and sending single updates to the other phone, while and absolutely awesome capability, is somewhat kludgy to perform.This system has worked great for us, I recommend it."
1,"I had no choice, because we have this system at home","I don't like the Panasonic phones because the batteries are not good at toooo... expensive. Anyway this system seams to be phased out, I couldn't find the handset in any store, so I had to go online to buy it. We are stuck with this system because we cannot buy another model with the base we have at home."
1,I don't understand how some of you don't have problems,"I have five of these phones and a base unit. Without exception, each unit's battery gave problems within a few months. (And I did charge each of them 15 uninterrupted hours when starting and whenever they requested it.)Now some won't light at all. On some the battery only goes up to 1 out of 3 bars. On others, it starts at 3 bars but drops to one bar about as quickly as you can get it to your ear.If someone has a solution, please hint at it here."
2,Battery Life Bad,"Battery life, bad.Features, good.Battery life, bad.Range, good.Battery life, bad.Did I mention.... ________________(fill in the blank)"
2,"Excellent features, two terrible flaws","I have been using this phone for over a year and still like features like ability to send directory from the base to a handset. The problem is that this phone has 2 fundamental flaws. One is battery life, even with Energizer NiMh replacement battery (much better than the original NiCd battery), that is pathetic 1.5 hours of talk time. Do not even consider having a conference call with his phone (even without wireless booster activated).The second problem is that display fades in and out. I noticed that when the phone is totally charged it is mostly out. This makes dialing ""blind"" and stored directly totally useless.I do not think I will be buying any Panasonic phones in the feature even they have all the features I want."
2,"Good features, very weak battery life","I like the features of this phone. particularly the speaker phone, strong reception even far from the base station, overall look and feel. The achilles heel of this system is the very weak battery life. The cordless handset is frequently completely out of juice and will not even ring.Also, the answering system on the base station is not very reliable. My previous answering system was an old tape-based Panasonic model that - while archaic - worked much better. The new system rarely erases all the messages. Also the ringer volume on the base station is not very high."
3,Nice phone but breaks easy,This is a replacement phone for one that broke. Second time we had to replace in two years. System works well but one drop or hard bump and you need a new phone.
4,So many features,"I have to agree that the battery life leaves a little more to be desired. I bought the system, with 5 extra handsets, and I found myself switching handsets mid-conversation. I did charge for 15 hrs b4, and no luck. I bought all new batteries at a battery store, and have had great great working time since. The phones, wow, intercom, monitor, pager, and it works with the booster feature to the corner of the street. They also work as 2 way radios away from the base. I am sold on the product, Loved it since replacing the battery."
1,Stay away. Battery life is terrible.,"I agree with many of the prior reviewers, the battery life on my KX-TGA270S is now about 15 minutes. Started off ok, but no longer (have had phone for ~6 months).I called Panasonic, they are sending a replacement battery for the phone, but judging by prior reviewers now, I am less than hopeful that this will fix the problem."
1,Great features but Terrible Battery life -4-5 mos after buy,"If I had reviewed this phone soon after I had bought it (first 2-4 months), I would have given it at least 4 stars because of the features and pretty good battery time. However as time went on, battery life has deteriorated to a point that it is a joke. Sometimes we get just 20 minutes without speaker phone. I have both a speaker phone/base station and an extension set. The extension is worse, but the base station is the same in terms of battery life. So if you see 4 or 5 stars in the rating by some Amazon reviewer for this phone, you know it is someone who just recently bought the phone; if you seee 1 star, it is someone like me, who Panasonic has nicely fleeced but has finally figured it out!!!"
2,Battery life terrible,Everything is fine with this phone / system except battery life. Ugh. I've owned it less than a year and I'm going to buy another phone system today because I'm sick of terrible battery performance.
2,Bad battery or bad phone?,"This phone is by far one of the best cordless phones on the market as far as features and reception. But it has the worst battery life I have ever seen on a cordless headset. Battery goes out after about 15 mins. of actual take time. I'm even afraid to use the speakerphone feature most of the time because I don't want to be cut off before I finish a whole conversation. I was a big Panasonic fan before I purchased this phone, but I would not even consider buying another phone from this company."
2,The Worst Battery Life I've Ever Seen,"I bought this phone about 6 months ago and I agree with all the users here that this could be a great phone in terms of features, but the battery issues make the phone so impossible to deal with, I'm ready to throw it out the window. As others have mentioned if you leave the phone out of the cradle for even a couple of hours or if you have a long phone call, the batteries immediately die. If you try to charge it, sometimes the phone never charges. You pick it up after 12 hours of charging and the low battery indicator is still on. Gave the same system to my parents, and they have the same problem. Could have been great..."
5,So happy to find this replacement hand held unit.,We were so happy to replace a cordless handset that had worn out. Amazon got us connected to a dealer who still had replacements 10 years after we purchased it.
3,"Great features, but.....","We have two of these phones and have the same battery life problems, having to switch to another phone during a long conversation, and they do not charge when the base says it is charging. Very frustrating - but we love the features style."
3,Great Features--Terrible battery.,"I love the features of this phone but the batteries that come with it make it unusable. The phone will tell you there is plenty of battery left and then BAM! right in the middle of a phone call it goes dead. I replaced the NiCd batteries it shipped with with some NiMh batteries from batteries.com and it has worked flawlessly since then. With better batteries, this would be a five star phone easily. Make sure to add $20 to the price of this phone because that's what you'll spend on a workable battery."
1,Pathetic Battery Life,"My parent were upgrading their cord phone system and decided to go cordless with what Panasonic was offering as a wonderfull option. Now we have a complete system, but it only help make us run from one phone to the other and to the other in order to complete a 20 min call. Battery life is terrible, even after a 5 minute call the battery is dead. Panasonic should have had recall this product in order to conserve customer satisfaction. As another reviewer said: ""more good money waste"". I have another Panasonic battery system that require charging every 3 calls, which keep the phone always functionable."
2,A well written disappointment.,"PD James' books are so engaging due to a combination of a clever who-dunnit mixed with literary observations about the human condition. She elevates the genre head and shoulders above anyone else writing in the same vein. However in A CERTAIN JUSTICE, the mystery side of it is not rewarded by clever deduction but rather by an ordinary chain of events. The solution is not arrived at via sleuthing but by a chain of events that would have occured had anyone been assigned to the case. The opening book is the most intriguing. Downhill from there. Real disappointing."
3,The jury is still out on this one.,"This is my first P.D. James book. Although I love mysteries and usually check back pages to see who did it so that I can look for the clues the writer gives, I did not with this book. I was drawn in by all of characters and liked the way she gave motives for most of them. Any one of a number of people could have done it.I had not guessed who the murderer was and was disappointed by the confession in a long, long letter. The ending was a let down also. Felt it left things hanging.I do enjoy her writing and insights on why people act as they do, but something was missing here. I intend to read more of her books before I form a definite opinion."
2,Social stereotypes behave predictably...,"There is little new or surprising in this latest effort from James. There is a certain whiff of snobbery and misogeny about this book. The main female characters (nearly all victims of one sort or another) are portrayed by dysfunction, insecurities and social class, with scant attention to any unique individuality. Few of the characters elicit interest or sympathy. Dalgleish, the most complex character here, is woefully absent for big chunks of this book. I'm not surprised this is getting better reviews in the US, distance from its setting (London, UK) probably enhances its plausability!"
1,Hardly a worthwhile purchase,"The plot is poor, the characterizations are simplistic, the solution is arrived at without any deduction, and the writing is stuffy and overblown. What's to like?I might have given it 2 stars if it were not for Ms James' extraordinarily irritating verbal tic -- ""hardly"". ""I would hardly ask him that"", etc. Hardly a common turn of phrase but it appears that Ms James can hardly write a paragraph of dialogue without it."
3,A Certain Justice,I thought the beginning was dragged out. Adam Dalgliesh doesn't appear until the end. Very unsatisfactory ending. Have liked other P.D. James books better.
5,Another Impressive Novel By P.D. James,"Think I would agree with the reviewer who said Ms. James is the finest literary British mystery novelist in the world. She is impeccable. This novel is one of those books where almost everyone is glad the victim is dead, and more than one suspect was tempted to kill her. James is not just writing a who done it, she is analyzing human nature and society, and gives more than one profound insight into humans and their behavior.As a minor flaw, I might tend to side with those critics who said this could have been a bit shorter. Once in a while the novel did seem to drag a bit. However, as usual, James is superb.Besides, who doesn't like a book where a repugnant lawyer is killed?"
4,Great characterization,"While the ending isn't what most people would expect, the development of the characters inhabiting this book is fantastic. Venintia and everyone she touches just comes to life, jumping off the pages. Sometimes, these things are enough to make a very good book."
4,Good book.,A good P D James mystery. P D James fans should enjoy this book. I found it a bit slow in parts.
2,"Sort of interesting, but ineffectively presented","This is a very standard P.D. James mystery in terms of plot and characters. The story is somewhat interesting, but is not well told - the book is far lengthier than it should be given the plot.The characters, normally decent, are very two dimensional with stereotypical old english personalities. All of them are hyper-aware of the feelings of other and all seem to notice small details with clarity (and are only too happy to exposit for pages). Also, James continues to beat the gender-differences drum monotonously, which makes the text seem dated.Overall, I would not recommend going out of your way to read this one."
3,Mixed Feelings...,"I am a big fan of PD James, however, I found A CERTAIN JUSTICE to be a disappointment. There wasn't any clever sleuthing in this novel, just a common deduction. Not much of Dalgliesh either. A believable story, but there wasn't enough going on to keep me intrigued. A good start but midway I couldn't wait for it to be over."
2,A bit overdone,"I had high hopes for this book, and was certainly interested in the ""large print"" aspect, but was dismayed to find that the publisher chose to make the print SO large that only one letter would fit per page. While this did heighten suspense in that longer words required quite a bit of page-turning, I feel that Random House may have gone a bit overboard."
1,Very inefficient mystery,"This is the first PDJ I read, and it has all the makings of a cheap mystery. In the name of ""character development"", all the characters NOT CONNECTED to the plot are given a lot of bandwidth. Half-way through the 'mystery', I figured out who the 'culprit' was, because that character was not being given any importance.I dont understand the similarities drawn to Ms Chrisite. Her books have an aura of spookiness, which PDJ has not achieved in this book."
4,Outstanding British mystery.,"IMHO P. D. James is the best living Mystery writer and her Adam Dalgliesh is the most well developed character in the modern novel. I wish Dalgliesh had a larger role in this particular book. ""A Certain Justice"" delivers a wide array of interesting personalities involved in a complex and unpredictable mystery. Lots of fascinating details about the English system of Law."
5,Many layered character study ala P.D. James,"As are all of P.D. James novels, this is very involved with character development. I felt that the effect s of obsession was the main theme of the novel. Kate's character is further explored. Ms James also delves into the divergent paths taken by Kate and Ash who are born into the same appalling circumstances...Kate becoming a police officer, Ash, a sociopath. The effects of love of all kinds... or the lack of it... is also explored. Dagliesh in this novel does not do much except glue the pieces together. All in all a most fascinating book which is more than an ordinary mystery and happily filled the hours driving a 1500 mile trip."
4,Worth dredging through the first 40 pages!,"I had a very tough time getting ""into"" this book. However, once I made my mind up to get through it, I was pleasantly surprised. It was my first PD James book and I recommend it for those with a little patience."
3,Just average,"Like most of James's books, this one was a bit slow to start. There are a bunch of characters all introduced and it takes a bit of time to sort them all out. And, I admit, I thought the middle of this story dragged a bit more than a lot of the others. It just didn't grab me in quite the same way, perhaps because I had no feelings one way or the other about many of the characters - including the deceased. Still, the story came together in the end, even though it was a little bit of a stretch plot-wise. Not the type of mystery you're likely to be able to solve yourself, with all the odd twists and turns. But it was those odd twists that, in the end, kept it interesting.It's worth reading, but not the best P.D. James book by a long shot. Two better ones that leap to mind, for me, are The Murder Room and The Lighthouse."
3,P.D. delivers,"Another clever psychological thriller from P.D. Although some of the behaviours were a little too pat, this was an enjoyable mystery with the usual unnerving insights into Dalgliesh."
4,Excellent biographical work.,I bought this book because I wanted a counter to another book on another Japanese woman in a position of influence. What I found in these pages is an inspiring story that proves the cause of women is indeed universal. I highly recommend it.
5,Eggcellent Slicer,"Not only is this little chick slicer cute, it slices great. I have even used it to slice mushrooms and small amounts of mozzarella cheese. Great little kitchen gadget...a real must have for your kitchen!!"
2,"Cute, but not practical","We got this as a gift from my MIL, and, while cute, is not terribly functional. The wires get caught on the plastic parts, making it difficult to re-open after cutting through the egg. It also doesn't cut all the way through a jumbo egg, it leaves a bit on the bottom uncut, and you have to push it back up through the wires to finish the cut."
2,CUTE EGG SLICER,Cute but is for reg. eggs only. Extra large eggs is like getting into my tight jeans. To open the slicer you have to look for the small extended plastic.
2,cute but not very good,"It looks cute, but the cute-factor no longer soothes my irritation when this product turns what should be a simple matter of slicing an egg into an ordeal. The product is difficult to clean and the metal wires just don't have enough tension in them to be able to cut the egg properly - they get pushed out of the way and seem so flimsy that I am amazed they have not snapped yet."
4,Perfect for the Grandkids,My grandchildren like to slice their own hardboiled eggs. This cute slicer makes it even more fun for them. I was disappointed though that the items are not dishwasher safe.
3,"Good for eggs, not mushrooms","I had one of these for a few years and it's always worked well on eggs. Recently, my girlfriend realized that we could also use it to slice mushrooms, thus taking a few minutes out of dinner prep time. I gave that a shot and found it rather difficult to get through a pretty average cremini mushroom, but still better than what we were doing before... until, a few mushrooms later, one of the wires snapped.If you only want to cut eggs, this should do just fine for you, but don't try to use it on anything harder!"
4,Almost a home run,"Wedgey certainly is cute. However, keep in mind to only use this on eggs or other very soft food items. It is a little hard to line the wires up appropriately. For the price, this is a good piece of equipment and a whimsical addition to any kitchen."
1,Cute but poor performer.,"I've only owned this for a few months and one of the wire cutters is already broken. And because of the way it is designed (one continuous loop of wire), all of the other wires have lost tension. Now when I slice an egg, the wires don't always line up with their slots. This is compounded by the fact that there is a lot of play in the hinge.I used to think this was cute but now it's super annoying to use and I feel mocked by it's stupid little face.Sure I may have abused it by slicing mushrooms, but I expect an egg slicer to be able to handle that.Today I bought a Westmark egg slicer. It's cast aluminum body feels sturdier and it is definitely better designed (made in Germany). Each wire cutter is it's own individual wire that relies on a metal connection (not plastic) to stay tensioned and seated. Also there is very little slop in the hinge. It may have cost fives times more, but I think it will prove to be worth it."
2,broke after first use,"I gave this 2 stars because this egg slicer is really cute, that was the only good quality about this product. However, one of the wires broke after the FIRST use! I was slicing de-shelled, hard-boiled eggs (what this product is meant for) and I didn't even get to the 3rd egg and it was broken."
5,great product,Such a cute product to add to my daughters Wedgey collection. She asked for an egg slicer for Christmas. Was excited to get the Wedgey. Cuts eggs great.
1,Messed up a good product,"The original CamoCare Soothing Cream was fantastic; I was a faithful user. Since they changed the formula, it is awful! It won't absorb on your hands and is very gritty. They have lost a long time customer. I would like to see the old formula brought back!! It worked wonders. Why not sell both formulas?"
2,New formula--they've ruined it!,"It's still got the extra strength camomile to calm your skin, but the new base makes my face feel dried out. I now have to use another cream with the Camocare to keep my face from feeling tight. I won't buy it again."
3,"Marginally Better than Most ""Big Books""","Much of this one was entertaining, despite the wide range of artists and writers. A lot of fun material included here and the book is a good read if you just want a bit of a distraction."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I have quite a few daily meditation books that I have been using throughout the year. I really look forward to reading them each day.I was disappointed with this one. First of all, the first letter of the first word in each paragraph is missing, probably because this is a Kindle edition. It's still distracting though. I just didn't feel like I got much out of this daily meditation book. It's one of the last ones that I read each day because of that reason.The good point of this book is that it was free on kindle."
4,Good Stuff,"Recorded on two seperate occasions in 1963 and 1965 with replacement drummer Roy Haynes, while Quartet regular Elvin Jones was in rehab, this is a fine addition for any Coltrane collector. Though Jones' trademark thunder is absent, Haynes adds a tight finesse to the typically wild Quartet sound. The material is strong throughout, especially ""Dear Old Stockholm"" and the serene ""After the Rain"". The frenetic ""One Down,One Up"" and ""After the Crescent"" (both recorded during the 1965 session) evoke the kindred mayhem of Coltrane's ""Sun Ship"" recordings made that year and suffer many of the same problems of his work of that period. Unquestionably, the high point here is the albums swan song ""Dear Lord"". Perhaps the saddest song Trane ever performed; understated and wonderfully blue, it reminds us that beyond his legacy as avant garde explorer he was first and foremost a master of melody and lyricism."
5,Dear Old Stockholm,"""One Down, One Up"" is an absolutely shattering performance. Coltrane and Co. are dancing brilliantly between form and chaos. Some of Coltrane's later ""transcendent"" music sounds to my ears a bit squawky and abrasive, but this relies more on vamps, with all of the defiant anti-authoritarianism of free jazz -- think of it as a cross between ""My Favorite Things"" and ""Om."" Having not yet been born in the 60s, I use the passion, fury, and exuberance of this recording to channel backward to a frightening but more hopeful time. Every time I listen to this record I come away thrilled yet haunted. Thank you, John Coltrane!"
5,Great Book for the Study of Indian Cinema,"This book offers an in depth study of Indian popular cinema, concentrating mainly on films made during the 1950's and 60's after India gained nationhood. The book provides insight into how Indian cinema dramatically influenced popular culture by reinforcing values or creating new ones, and highlighting/recreating Indian history through film. The book also sheds a great deal of light on the symbolisim that is a part of all Indian films. I would reccomend this book to anyone who has a love of Indian cinema or who may want to learn more about it. A good historical analysis with many good photos."
1,Ignore the Title,"This book does go over Hawaiian Folk tales but only in direct comparison to the Bible. This is more a comparative religion text than a book of tales and legends. No tale is told in its entirety without constant interjections pointing out how similar Hawaiian tales are to Biblical tales. All in all, a frustrating read for those who are not already familiar with Hawaiian legends."
3,"Hawaiian Folk Tales, A collection of Native Legends","I am always looking for ways to learn more about the people of the South Pacific Islands, especially all the folk tales of so long ago handed down verbally from one family member to another. At last written down for all to enjoy!"
4,pretty good for reaching back there,"When dry, it feels like it'd be rough on your skin - pretty much like a regular loofah does. Once wet though, it's great, just abrasive enough to clean but not harsh enough to be uncomfortable. I love it."
2,Bristles too soft,"There is nothign ""wrong"" with the brush but my personal taste is for something a little stiffer. My opinion is that most people would find this brush too soft."
4,A very satisfactory back brush,"The brush is very nice. My only two complaints -->> I would wish for the bristles to be slightly stiffer and the brush itself slightly longer in length,... another inch or preferably two,... but overall it is very satisfactory. (Only those two ""issues"" keep it from being perfect)."
1,Faulty product...be careful,"Believe it or not, even a back brush can be faulty! I bought two of these and the plastic that holds the bristles on both brushes has cracked. I threw the first brush out thinking that it was a fluke but once I started using the second brush the plastic began to crack as well. So much so that the plastic that cracked fell off and scratched my back. I am just glad that I do not have a huge cut. This is obviously a faulty production and the vendor is trying to dump them. Amazon should not be selling this product!"
1,Not well made,"Within a week, the plastic that holds the bristles cracked, and it has lost half of it's bristles. Cheaple fabricated, probably in China."
5,Wonderful brush!!,"This was a need that I put off getting for some time, but, so glad that I purchased this brush. It's easy to handle, doesn't scratch my skin and after having it for sometime time now, hasn't shown any water damage."
2,Great for your back in the shower,"Feb 7th 2012:The brush is wooden which is nice and the bristles are on a plastic piece. There is a slight curve to the angle of the handle and the length is just right to reach everywhere. Now, for some the bristles on this might hurt - they are a bit stiff and pointy. I like it, it feels good and exfoliates well. Lather it up with some body wash and your back will love it. Get a good scrub and clean feeling - just what I needed. Oh, and there is a nice loop on the end so I can hang it to dry.REVISED:12/30/12 - one year later with very light use if any the bristles are falling off and the plastic cracked - see my pictures posted. This brush is going in the trash -"
3,nice on the skin,Not too rough. It works like it should. I only rated mine a three as it has a crack in the wood already from getting wet and drying out a few times.
2,Ow!,"I just touched this brush with my fingers and thought ""how could anyone use this to bathe with?"""
5,window to the past (a spotless one!),"This book was written in 1904 and reprinted in 1984. It has chapters on the duties of specific staff (butler, housekeeper, chamber maid, footman, etc) and instructions to employers on how to treat their servents and what is fair pay. Incredible to think that the majority of wealthy and middle class AMERICANS (as well as the lower class and working class) lived this way until the stock crash in 1929. Also has some very interesting recipes - terrapin anyone?"
5,Great condition,I spent a good amount of time observing the book. I was excited that the book was on time for class and was exactly what i needed
2,Disappointing,"Although the book has good content there are so many typos, grammatical errors, and missing words that it makes it almost too distracting to absorb the content. I am very disappointed that a $75.00+ textbook has such poor to non-existent editing and proof reading."
3,"Full of good info, but a boring read.....","I read this book for my marriage and family class in a Masters program. While there is lots of good information, I didn't know one student in the class who enjoyed it. At times it was ass numbingly dull and more than one of us required caffeine to get through one chapter. That having been said, if you're going to be a marriage and family counselor, it's probably a good book to keep as a reference."
5,"BEST EDITION AVAILABLE, BY FAR","This hardcover edition from Peninsula Press is unquestionably the best available edition of Thoreau's Cape Cod, for these reasons:1) While all other editions are based on Thoreau's journal entries from only his first three visits to the Cape, this edition includes an epilogue compiling Thoreau's notes from his fourth and final visit, in which he traveled south to Chatham and Monomoy.2) This is the only edition to translate the many, many Greek and Latin phrases Thoreau includes throughout the work, and it is also the only edition to provide illustrations, maps, and sidenotes in-text.3) This is the only indexed edition ever created.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of both Cape literature and Thoreau in general."
3,Thoreau's Cape Cod,"I am slowly getting through the book -- too much else going on. So far, it has been a pleasant read as Thoreau points out and comments on people, geography, history of the Cape, and events that occur, e.g., a shipwreck -- to which many people not directly connected to the tragedy don't seem to care a 'hoot'. The book was recommended by a friend who is an English professor as we in a book group were discussing 'The Thoreau You Don't Know' by Robert Sullivan -- which most of the group enjoyed and learned from. The recommendation came up after I mentioned I was reading 'A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers' which I retitled 'An Infinity on the Concord and ...'. That has to be the most boring book I ever read next to 'Vanity Fair'.So far, 'Cape Cod' is written in a relatively lively style compared to other Thoreau writings I've encountered. It has been enjoyable!"
4,The Bicycle by Daniel F,"THE BICYCLE MANBY Allen SayBikes, kids, teachers, parents, 2 army men, how much more can this book have? In Japan today at school there's a race there's a red team and a white team. The youngest kids ran first. The teacher said'' go. Adults, teachers were cheering. It sounded like thunder. The winners went up and got their prizes. After adults raced a 2 legged race. Then a hush cleared the schoolyard we all stopped and looked at the gate we were scared. 2 American army men walked in and asked could they ride the bike. They did tricks on the bike. After they thanked the principal. Then they left. I recommend this book to 7,8,9,and 10 year olds. I liked this book because it tells you a lot about the Japan race. I would buy the Bicycle Man take it to a race and enjoy. by Daniel F"
5,Undeservingly overlooked,"I just noticed that the COMPLETE LIVE AT THE VV RECORDINGS 4-disk set is ranked 5,000 and that this 4-disk set is ranked 43,000 as far as purchases from this site. This set certainly does not deserve to be so much lower than other similarly-priced Coltrane cd's. The playing in this set is beautiful, ruthless, and exploratory. This isn't the ""classic quartet"" but this group made music of awesome power and beauty. For my money, Alice Coltrane is one of the most overlooked pianists in jazz history and I don't know why. She is fantastic throught this set. This is Coltrane at some of his scariest, the only way this set could be better is if it were 10 cd's."
5,heavy duty,Shirt is very heavy and durable. Will have to wait to see how quickly it fades from washings? I will purchase more.
3,Beware--this might not be the band you're thinking of...,"Just thought I'd give a heads-up on this one. I saw the listing of other CDs people have purchased along with this one. In that list, ""Burn the Sun"" and ARK S/T are tops on the list. That means there are probably several thousand of you out there who were unpleasantly surprised to find that this band isn't the same as the one who produced the aforementioned 2 CDs.This band is a Rock/pop outfit from Sweden, very good at what they do, but likely to disappoint fans of Progressive Metal, which is what the *other* ARK plays.So if you love Jorn Lande, Tore Ostby, and the ARK album ""Burn the Sun,"" DO NOT BUY THIS CD. It's not the same band."
3,was ok but read better from Maeve,Was a lot of stories in the one book so didnt get too deep into any of them. Not bad for a light read.
3,Average,The quality is fairly good. I think there should be less of the larger sizes and more of the smaller sizes. The average person will probably never use the large sizes.
3,WARNING - Not J.D. Souther!,"Amazon has erroneously linked J.D. Souther to this CD. The artist is Souther Still, a band out of England and has nothing to do with the ""Sixth Eagle"". My three star review is admitedly tainted by Amazon's goof. After one listen, I can honestly say these guys aren't bad but just not what I was expecting. Go to their website southerstill.com if you are interested."
4,warning: not a mystery,"Lawrence Block is known as a mystery writer, and I like his mysteries very much. Probably because publishers are jerks, this book is billed as a mystery. It isn't. There is very little suspense, and no mystery at all. This book is erotic fiction. If you know that before you read it, so that you are not disappointed by the lack of mystery, you may well enjoy it very much: it is *very* good erotic fiction"
1,Don't Waste Your Time!!,"Let me say right up front, I think Lawrence Block, the winner of numerous Edgars for his mystery novels, is one of my favorite novelists of all time. His Matthew Scudden novel series and Bernie Rhodenbarr/ Burglar series are, in my opinion, without peer. I even took one of Block's 2-day seminars in the mid 1980's called ""Write For Your Life."" That's how much I love Lawrence Block.But this book ""No Score - A Chip Harrison Mystery"" is not a mystery at all.Block wrote this novel in 1970, and it's nothing more than the rantings of an 18-year old boy in the quest for his first sexual experience with a woman.That's the plot!So in effect, there is no plot.Sure, there's a few laughs along the way, but not one reason to continue reading, which I sadly did, to the very end.It was a huge disappointment, to say the least."
3,Beginner's point of view,"Just started playing recorder four weeks ago. Bay's book is good in that it teaches you to read music while you learn to play your instrument, and it gives you a CD featuring several of the pieces in the book - a huge benefit. The oversights I've noticed are a)there's barely any instruction on breathing method and b)""tongueing"" (a very basic must-know skill) isn't explained at all. I found myself spending time on the internet to supplement these oversights, and even had to re-train myself on how to produce clear notes."
5,Want to learn recorder? This is the product for you!,"I love this product. It has everything - pictures, big print, and a CD so you can hear what you are supposed to sound like. Best of all, the CD has accompaniment, which makes playing the pieces really fun. It progresses in a very logical way, and I found that it was a very easy way to learn. I'd buy it again and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn."
5,Don't mess with Texas!,"This third full length album from Austin's Paul Newman continues the foursome's exploration of kinetic, visceral (mostly) instrumental indie-rock. Once again, vocals are kept to a minimum, allowing for the intricate drums, in-the-pocket bass and aggressively lilting guitar riffs to chart the sonic journey. While not as dynamic as their previous 'Only Love Can Break Your Heart', this album does offer up a plate full of aural rhythms. The interplay between the two guitars alone is enough to get you up off the couch, while simultaneously bringing a nostalgic tear to your eye. For fans of Dianogah, Pell Mell, and Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, although any rockin' instrumental addict will not be disappointed. Do yourself a favor, go out and buy this (or any Paul Newman) release and pat yourself on the back for supporting a vastly under-appreciated and underrated band."
3,Dark and Haunting,"Prager's novel does suffer at times - there are two or three scenes that don't seem to quite make sense. The character relationships are not as well-developed as they could be. However, it was interesting for me because it explored the female side of the Holocaust: how could Christian women continue to be involved? Eve's motivation - keeping the memory of the victims of the Holocaust alive - is admirable as she forces friends and strangers to remember that no one was safe. The stories that Eve produces, allegedly concocted from her research, are intimate and tailored to her audience. The best scene in the novel to me was when Eve encounters a male Holocaust survivor. Prager's books are hard to find, so good luck at your local used bookstore or library."
1,The only book I hate,"I came across this book whilst doing an American Literature course in my English University. I am a self professed literary snob but will read anything that is offered to me, note recent delves into Snagged by Mary Higgins Clark and Lost by Gregory Maguire. I love literature in all its shapes and forms, the printed word is a beautiful thing. Having said that this book is not merely an affront to anyone remotely connected to any war or human induced suffering, but is an affront to language itself. Prager's self obssesed heroine and the author's inate ability to make mountains out of molehills and vice versa combine in a glorification of self indulgence and narcissism. It is not an intriguing study of a mid life crisis as is claimed. As a fan of Bridget Jones, Little Nell and Bartleby I hate this book."
4,Portable Sauna,"I bought the sauna to help with the muscular-skeletal pain, and it is helpful. The chair that came with the product is useless, as it is very uncomfortable, but I like the rest of the sauna. I use my own more comfortable chair. The portability is nice. I use it in my TV room each evening while watching my favorite show. Although not a cure for my lyme disease related pain, it certainly has helped. Other saunas are certainly more beautiful, but I like the fact that I can do something else while taking a sauna. The price was right too, which was definitely a factor, given the expense of lyme related treatment overall. The four stars are due to the uncomfortable chair. The one pictured was not the one I received."
4,Feels So Good,I bought this for my daughter. She has heavy metal toxcity which brought on fibromyalgia. She is taking neutraceuticals and detoxing. This sauna has been the perfect solution. The only thing she hates about it is the buzzer that starts 5 minutes before the timer shuts off. She will be so relaxed and then the buzzer starts. There is no reason for that that we can think of. If it shuts off and you sit in there longer so what. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
1,Not satisfied with Cyber Planet,"Cyber Planet initially sent item to New York instead of El Paso, Tx., thus delaying delivery by over a week.Then Cyber Planet shipped a less expensive model of the Portable Sauna while charging for the more expensive model, stating that they did not have another model in stock.This item was never used by me or my wife because we sent it back for a refund, mainly because it was not the model that we ordered. The model we ordered stated that it also had a foot pad warmer. The model we received did not have a foot pad warmer, which essential for people with foot problems. The foot warmer can also be used by men to sit on for prostate benefits."
4,Portable Infrared Sauna,"This could almost be word for word the review I read, probably posted just above this one, prior to purchase. The control is a bit funky but usable. The chair is uncomfortable but works. I wish I had purchased the large instead of regular and I'm only 5'7"" but it's OK. This being said, for the price and the wonderful heat therapy it provides, I'm quite good with it. Next time, when this wears out, perhaps I'll be able to purchase a better one but I'm already almost addicted to my time in the ""envelope"" as I call it. I put my laptop on a tv tray and watch Netflix movies or catch up on email, even though sticking your arms out is a bit awkward. I could not hold a book. :)"
1,The package was sent as if it was a returned product,"The package was delivered as already openned one, which I suspect was a returned product. This made me feel uncomfortable. The heating power seems to be low. After 30 min heating I, normally easy to sweat, didn't sweat."
5,best Turkish coffee available in U.S.,Have had the pleasure of this brand of coffee for two years. It is superb.try it if you enjoy Turkish coffee.
4,Mehmet Efendi Turkish coffee is what i was looking for !!,"I have been looking for some sort of ""Real"" Turkish coffee around coz i used to drink Turkish coffee as part of my rituals in the morning being a Middle Eastern and i finally found it.I will re-buy it most definitely"
5,"Wonderful, Rich Body...Love the caffeine.","This is, without a doubt, the best Turkish Coffee I have ever tried. Very sophisticated taste. Unfortunately, I am not a coffee connoisseur. But I prefer this to anything made at Starbucks, Peetes or Diedrichs. If you love the taste of coffee and haven't tried any Turkish Coffee before, this is the genuine article. I just brew mine in a simmering pot over the stove. No fancy gizmos. Not that I wouldn't love to try to make it in one of those tiny pots, but my house is filled with every Ronco infomercial kitchen appliance since 1989 and I don't have any more room. Plus, its like 3 of those pots to one of my coffee cups. Finally, this stuff lasts forever and a day. It should take me a month or two to finish it."
1,Do Not buy it,This is wrong advertisement. It is NOT turkish coffee. I had some that I broght from Turkey and this one smells completely different.
4,"A little slow at first, but then it's great!","I read the book cause I'm a infocom game fan. The book is excellent once you get into it. Some parts are down right hilarious, others are filled to the brim with puns. So arm yourself with you Acme Kitchen Wonder, put on your Magic Glasses, and prepare to run from the Boot Patrol (just read the book already)"
4,music fan needs music education,"a wonderful disc you should never be without, however statements that resemble-"" better than REK, Townes, and Buddy Holly"" are patently absurd. adam carroll is a great texas artist that definitely doesn't get an iota of the credit he deserves, I might compare him to REK (on a long shot). however when the Beatles appear on Ed Sullivan and ask in amazement-""was this the same stage that Buddy Holly played on?"" it helps you realize the landscape change that some artists can make happen. but opinions are opinions, different strokes for different folks. in any case.........buy this album"
2,Way overpriced at time and poorly made.,"My fiance and I spent around $150 for this phone and around 75 for an additional handset. This phone is extremely crappy. On of the legs of the base station snapped off. The phone batteries randomly cut power and your call is lost. The phone will not consistantly keep a charge. I have sent 2 sets back to Texas. These things are about as cool as cancer. I will never purchase pannasonic brand products again after having to hastle with non English speaking idiots from Texas. Save your money, you'd have better quality with a soupcan and some string."
4,Phone replacement search,"My mother who now has dymentia and is soon to be 85 years young, had used the Panasonic phone that was purchased for probably 15 years at least. The phone recieved a power surge and burned out the base unit. I had tried different new phones with her but she could not make the change. I desparately needed to find a phone like her existing Panasonic. I was very happy to have found it on Amazon. Even though it is refurbished it still works well for her and she can continue using it like she did in the past. Shipping was timely and so far I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Good product to buy,I bought this phone from amazon. It works very well. No problems since the past 30 days that I have bought it and started using it. The price was great..Will recommend this product.
2,Not Impressed,"In short, I like gadgets with features. I thought I would like this phone system. I bought into this phone and set them up around the home. The reviews below are accurate. The battery life is short (less than 1 hour talk time) and I have already had to replace the batteries and I have not yet had the phone 1 year.The 'flash' feature does not work. I have Verizon and it does not respond when the 'flash' feature is pressed. Verison says it is the phone not giving the right signal or it is too short of a signal.Otherwise, the clarity is fine. I just hate not being able to easily switch to a second caller. I'd stay away from the series (maybe this brand) when I spend money to update this system.Good Luck!"
1,This is an aweful phone,"Bought this phone as a result of trying 2 different Panasonic 900 MHz phones (which were both poor quality). I thought I was just having a problem with the range and wanted to try the next up in MHz. BAD IDEA. Panasonic has come up with a seemingly ideal phone with some great looking features but they have no idea of how to build a phone that will work or customer service that will properly address the issue. They continue to sell this phone in spite of very poor craftsmanship.-Very bad battery life (sorry to say that it will NOT last more than 20 minutes)-Very bad sound quality-Very bad customer service-Very high priceMy parents have the same phone and have had the EXACT same problems as have I and 90% of the reviewers, keep reading if you do not believe me."
4,High Quality Phone,"I like it very much. However, the displayed screen on the based unit is rather small. I bought the KX-TG2740 model for my parents because it has a larger area display on the base. I like the speaker phone which allowed me to talk within 4ft with crystal clear quality. It also has the speaker phone on the handset too which allowed me to move about without carrying the base with me. It would be perfect if it could be louder. Overall It is the best phone that I have ever bought."
2,It's not what I've expected...,"I bought this phone because of its features: Caller ID, answering machine and expandable. But sorry to say I agree with most of the reviews of this phone. When I'm talking on the phone the other side of the line couldn't hear me for half of the time. I use the phone the first when I call my mom who's oversea and she said 'Why are you talking to me on a cheap phone?' It's not fun using this phone when calling long distance when I'm paying for every single minute, not even fun when I paid $130 for the phone, not at all. After reading the reviews I do realised that the caller id always have 'incoming' call and yes it is slow to show the number that's calling. I'll sure to try the method a review pointout to improve the function of the caller id.I had not have any complaint about the battary life maybe because I don't talk too long a time.If I had read the reviews before buying the phone, I don't think I get this after all."
2,Poor battery charger,"I purchased this phone for my home office. I have replaced the battery twice in 6 months and, according to the place of purchase, the battery should last 1-2 years. I have a much older Panasonic with speakerphone for my home and have never had to replace the battery. In this phone, it slowly provides less and less time between charges until you can only speak on the handheld for about 30 minutes before it dies completely. Panasonic has told me to send it in for a new one, which I plan to do. But, that is very inconvenient. The other features work fine when the battery is fresh, but the battery charger is a deal-breaker."
1,"Murali from Greenbay, WI","I bought this set from Amazon.com, around 6 months back. The brand and the instrument seems to be great, but NOT really. Call volume is VERY LOW even on speaker. I heard compliants many times about the quality of voice, volume, battery go dead so quickly.., which I never had ...[...]"
1,Horrible Battery!,I have had this phone for 5 months...and as most have said...battery life is horrible...even when its fully charged it runs for an hour-max!I am going to contact Panasonic and see if they can do something.Don't get it!
2,Poor battery life...,"The phone itself has wonderful features, all of which work well, but the battery life is only 24 hours off the base. I've had Panasonic phones in the past and never had one with this poor of a battery life. I've contacted Panasonic and they want to send me a reconditioned unit for the ""new"" one I purchased. They said it was part of the warranty on this particular phone. So, I'm guessing this phone has had major problems and that's why they're running such a great deal on it. I don't like refurbs on phones. The previous wear on the handset buttons takes a toll in just a few years. So I guess I'll purchase a new battery and see if that helps..."
1,Great phone with horrible battery life,"The phone works well an has many nice features, however, the battery life makes the phone unusable. I frequently have to call people back from my cell phone because the battery on the cordless unit has run dry. Talk time for the phone is literally <30 minutes without using the booster feature. Works fine as an answering machine."
3,Not what I expected!,At [$$$] Panasonic ships this product with NiCd battery and doesn't have a built-in charger for a spare battery in base.If you charge a partially charged NiCd battery it would graduallyloose its maximum charge (memory effect).Though its not as cute as the Siemens Gigaset 4215 model it hasloads of features (more than most people need).Ask yourself the following question :Would I need to have 8 handsets? If answer is NO I would suggestlook elsewhere.
1,This product sucks,"All,Never Ever buy this product.. Good Bye to Panasonic. Even after you charge it for 12 hours, you can only talk for 15 minutes.. This is pathetic.Amazaon.com, please stop marketing this product. I as well not got my mail in Rebate as well. Too bad.."
1,"Pathetic Phone - Don't ever Buy this, you just lost your money if you did",I have been trying to use this phone for last 2 months and this phone is awful. The battery dies in no time and I lost connection. Panasonic should be sued for selling such a pathetic performing product.thanks
1,Bought this phone for a business,"My employer purchased this phone for our salon. It began acting up about a week into owning it , and got so bad that we had to go back to our old phones within the month. It would constantly be &quot;searching for channels&quot; and would drop calls from clients! Unfortunately , she had thrown out the box, and we are stuck. I'll never buy this brand phone for myself, and I tell anyone I can to avoid it!"
2,Disappointed,"After re-reading the reviews, I'm not sure why I bought this product. Seems like there was plenty of warning.This is not the world's cheapest phone, so I was hoping for more. The battery it came with was almost worthless. I replaced it (the beginning of $$$) and saw better performance, but then the phone as a whole deteriorated so that now, about four months in, I can barely talk for 10 minutes before I get the dread ""No Link to Base"" message. It works fine as long as I'm willing to use it on speakerphone, but as a cordless handset it's 90% useless. Even more disappointing, the Panasonic headset I bought (more $$$) was also unusable with this phone ... I couldn't hear the other party at all. Why can't they get their act together before they sell this product?"
1,The worst cordless Panasonic ever produced!,"I am a Panasonic fan when it comes to cordless phones. I have used over ten Panasonics over the years since the introduction of cordless phone. I purchased this because of the reputation Panasonic had build on me. But I was wrong! This Phone is not a ""Panasonic"". I can barely hear the other party-I don't have any hearing problem-even at full level of volume. if I connect it to a headset there is a hum. My friends ask me if I am in propeller plane. The biggest disappointment is the battery. You won't believe this, but, this phone needs to be charged every 2 days. I don't use this phone at all (because of above reasons) but the battery goes COMPLETELY EMPTY IN 2 DAYS.Don't waist your money, this phone is useless!I have no idea why some people have left positive feedback on this!"
3,Great and Not-So-Great,"Bought this for the features, appearance and ability to intercom between handsets (wonderful feature with kids). Some of the features are excellent . . . the design is good, buttons are easy to hit, base is easy to work. However, the Caller ID is EXTREMELY unreliable - it takes 3-4 rings to show up. Also, battery life is unpredictable. And, a little petty issue, the answering machine takes a long time to get to messages (if you like to hit the button and go right to the messages this is not the phone for you). If you are someone who puts your phone on the base each night to charge - and doesn't rely heavily on caller ID - it's a great phone. But, based on the Caller ID and battery life - I wouldn't buy it again. Should have stuck with the tried and true AT&T or Sony phones!"
2,Bad Battery Life & Voice Quality,"The battery life is terrible. 3 months from the day I bought the phone, the battery would last only for a maximum of 30 minute phone call. Then I would be forced to recharge. Initially the battery lasted for 2 days but then just in 3 months the problems started.I called Panasonic and they did not want to send in a replacement battery. The only option they provided was to send the phone to their service center and then I would be stuck without a phone for 15 - 20 days ! Panasonic's service sucks. However, Amazon on the other hand was willing to help out and I was very pleased with their customer service."
2,"Failing past expiry of Warranty, a Panasonic Feature?","Is failing a few days, weeks past expiration of Warranty a Panasonic feature?Two of my phones have exhibited this behaviour, though I must mention that their eventual death were hastened by a powercut.But all my other equipment did not suffer the same fate from the power outage, but the Panasonic phones appear to be extremely sensitive. I'm now Wary of their long term life."
1,Few PROs.. many CONs,"I had Panasonic cordless 900 Mhz phone before... it was way better than this one. Panasonic took away some very useful features such as Automatic paging when the incomeing message is received, better battery life, ability to still hear clearly when another person picks up another phone on your end. I would stay away from this model, I hope newer model have better features."
2,"Feature packed, but...","This phone offers great features and is easy to use, but the battery life is terrible. I am on my second phone and plan on returning it to exchange it for another brand. Had a problem with the battery coming loose in the handset which causes the phone to think a fully charged battery needs recharging after 20 minutes of use. Manufacturer offered a solution, but did not solve the problem."
1,dont go for this,"pls..dont buy this phone guys.battery life is so poor,it deads so quickly.and amazon pls dont promote this product"
1,"Defective Product, Horible Customer service","This product has a defective battery. I called Panasonic Customer service and they themselves say battery has problem and ask me to buy new battery!!!!. Even though they know this product battery is defective, they cannot send a new battery!!!. What a horible service?. I am not sure why Amazon is promoting this junk product !!!. I brought this product without looking at ratings, because my previous Panasonic codeless worked without any issue for 4+ years... I never could imagine amazon and Panasonic will dump such a defective product in market.If Amzon cares about their customers, I would ask Amazon(or Panasonic) to ship a New battery to all the customers who brought this Junk from Amazon."
1,Should be a Lemon Law for these phones,"We have 8 of these phones and are extremely careful about the dreaded memory effect and they still are awful!!! The displays fade in and out at will....whether they are fully charged or not. We have one phone that will last all of one dialing fully charged. We bought new batteries for these and started all over, not charging until the phone was completely dead. Same results as before. HEY Panasonic...these are the most terrible phones we have ever had."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Very poor battery goes from full to recharge w/o warning, LCD screen goes blank all the time. I've sent this phone to Panasonic TWICE already for warranty replacement, and the refurbished ones are as bad. Extremely disappointing for something so expensive."
3,Battery is worst,I purchased this model along with the other 2.4GHZ panasonic model.The battery is worst. I had the phone since last not more then two month. Its battery died very fast and takes a lot time to charge.I called at panasonic support and the guy recommanded to keep the handset away from base station when the battery is fully charged. I did the same but that too doesn't resolve the issue.Now probably I will hunt for an other good phone.
1,Blank LCD Screen,I have had this phone and system for one year and it works extremely well except that my handsets go blank all the time. I have seven of these phones and all of them except for one has gone blank. The LCD screen comes back at random and it drives me nuts. I also dislike Panasonics support as I have had to deal with them more than once. You wait on the phone forever to get anyone and they aren't much help anyway. If I were you I would not get this system from Panasonic.
2,screen quality is poor,"the screen does not hold up on this product! even normal use generates scratches, cloudy spots, etc. when i contacted panasonic for support, they blew me off completely."
2,Battery is worst,The rechargable battery is worst .I ordered this phone in june 2005 and the battery is not charging well after 6 months .I couldnot speak at least for 10 minutes now .
1,hand set Battery doesnot last long,"The product was good for first 3 months later the battery in hand set started loosing power, even charged over night it lasts for 15 min or less,panasonic customer service sucks, they are not replacing the battery, the product comes with one year warranty still they are not helping to replace the product.I'm never going to buy any panasonuc products."
4,An excellent buy for the price,"I recently bought this phone and am so far satisfied with the clarity and features it has. I think it is a great buy for the price. I can not comment on the battery life because I have had the phone for less than one month. Earlier I had bought a 2.4 GHz cordless phone of a reputed Japanese make but was highly disappointed with the performance compared to this Panasonic one.If the battery life is a problem, how can we make it better ? Could any one suggest ?"
3,No Autodial in Handset,This phone is missing Auto dialing facility from Handset. You've to use base unit for speed dialing. All other features are cool.
2,Be aware that this will interfere with wireless networks,"this is the same frequency used by 802.11b and 802.11g wireless networks/routers. This means that even if you don't have wireless but an apartment or condo neighbor does, you may get really bad interference.You can read this article : http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3290381 for more information on wireless phones vs. wireless networks and interference."
2,Generally a disappointment,"I had high hopes for this phone, especially considering its hefty price tag. While the sound quality is generally good, it suffers some serious defects.First of all, although I followed the manufacturer's battery conditioning recommendations, battery life is poor compared to my 7 year old 900Mhz Sony. I can nary get the phone to display more than one bar of battery life on the handheld screen.More importantly, the speakerphone capability on the handset ceased functioning 35 days after I purchased the unit. Beyond that, the phone looks cheap and feels flimsy, and I find the user interface on the handheld quite awkward.All in all, I recommend that you consider alternative products."
3,great features buy lousy battery life,"This phone as all the right features, but runs out of battery life in about 20-30 minutes, I have a base station and 3 extensions, and go through all three batteries, and than forced to talk on the speakphone untill the batteries get recharged the next day.what features it's missing:Voice dailing - if we can have it on our cell phones, why not on a cordless.voice announcement - just saw this demostrated on another panasonic model. it'll verbally annouce a caller. very cool. not a requirement, but definitely very cool."
1,The worst model I have ever seen!,"I have had this KX-TG2730S model over three months now and everything worked fine until 2 months ago! The first problemstarted with battery life. It wouldn&#146;t hold the charge for more than 45 minutes of talk time. Then I started noticing ( 5 weeks after I purchased the phone) that caller ID would take 3 maybe 4 rings to show me the number. And finally a week ago the answering machine started to complain that its message box is full. The problem is that I never had (and still don&#146;t have) any messages. So I my voice-mail box can&#146;t record any messages. This phone does not have any special batteries to hold messages! It&#146;s one the new designs where messages get stored in a special memory chip. And trust me, the only option for me is to send it back to Panasonic. I just got of the phone with them and, yap, they will send me another refurbished one. I am NOT thrilled at all !!! Just disappointed that I purchased Panasonic in the first place!"
3,Good Quality but,"I was proud to receive this product initaily. It's works fine. Only problem, we have press hard on the charger to charge this unit. Otherwise, The charging light will not be on. The base unit LCD is very less. It will not display the number you have dailed."
4,The Right Seat,"I fly frequently with a pilot friend, and come up with questions after we have parted. This has answered many of those questions for me. It also makes you realize why he does the ""little"" things that don't seem important for someone without a pilot's license. I am anxious to get back in the air and try some of the books suggestions to help out my pilot friend."
4,Curious George,This is such a cute stuffed animal for any baby or toddler. I bought this for my 6 month old niece & she loves it!!
1,Cheap Knock-0ff,"This is NOT a Russ Berrie George of nice, soft plush. It is not 12 inches, but 13 when you read the tags. It is a cheap knock off of really BAD quality. I'm not sure that the picture is even the same product. I returned and found a different source."
1,Image on Amazon makes it hard to tell quality of toy,"We were very disappointed with this toy when it arrived. We sent it back to Amazon for a refund.It's hard to tell from the image on Amazon, but the toy that arrived was very poor quality. The ""fur"" of George was very shiny and not very soft. The stitching and overall ""weight"" of the toy seemed low quality as well.I hate to write this in a review, but when we took it out of the package, my wife and I came to the same conclusion. This toy seems like something one would win at a carnival. ""Plush"" is not descriptive of this toy."
2,JUST OK,"this was a present for a nephew. it doesnt seem like the quality will hold the test of time. we shall see. the part that really upset me was that it was suppose to be delivered by a certain date (eta) and it didnt make it by the eta. i know it was just an estimate, but we were leaving out of town the day after, and i was counting on it. i was very disappointed."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed that he has no tail - comes apart easily. I've already head to sew up the back of his head. If I had known he didn't have a tail I wouldn't have gotten him.
1,Not good for beginners,Don't get this book if you think you will learn about Buddhism. It is impenetrable and boring. Not a good choice for someone who wants to learn about Buddhism.
5,Gift for wife.,I bought the item as a present for my wife. She seemed very happy to receive it. Was surprised I had chosen it.
3,Nice,Very nice for daily reading. Each daily quote gives you pause for thought and helps starts the day on a positive path. I enjoy this book very much. Nicely done.
5,Truely Inspiring,"A truely inspiring book. Regardless of your faith, these writings will motivate and inspire you. A true guide to living in harmony with the universe!"
5,I love this book and read it every morning!,"This book is great. It has a gem of wisdom for every day of the year. Each quote is so thoughtfully written and chosen and I have been so inspired by it. I read it every morning.I highly recommend this book to anyone, Buddhist or not!"
3,Not bad for the money,Since this product did not cost an arm and a Leg it is not bad for the money. We use it to monitor our yard.
1,Piece of junk!!,if you or your neighbors a have cordless phone or wireless internet this camera is not for you. who doesn't these days?
1,Unhappy,There is no way to record both cameras unless you want to scan thru 2 unused channels because this item you can not lock out the 2 unused channels! So you can waste 10 seconds of blank recordings each pass thru the channels!
1,Swann NightHawk 2,I did not receive the Item in picture. The model number was the same but it looks totally different and there was no remote control.
2,Bad low light,"Daytime the cameras work ok, not great but acceptable. Terrible low light capability, late evening on all you see is black. Do not buy if you want it for low light situations."
2,Very sensitive System,"Swann has a good reputation, and I don't know if any competitive setup would perform any better, but these wireless cameras are much too sensitive to radio frequency interference to be utilized in any electronically populated area.Even with the option to tune down below the frequency of common wifi channels, I guess my cameras were still being bombarded with other frequencies - possibly from wireless phones and such. The manual is awash with ""do nots"" - keeping you from placing the cameras or the receiver anywhere near other electrical devices. These may work beautifully for surveillance in a more sterile environment, but I had awful luck with them."
4,good solution to watching my kid,"I connected this to a 13-inch TV I have in my office. I put the camera outside to watch when my 9-year old plays in the pool area. The camera is about 40-feet away and the signal has to go through 5 walls. The picture jumps a little once in a while but it works well enough that I can see my son clearly. The other camera is watching the front door and it works fine, especially at night. We used it to watch the trick or treaters when they came up the walk. For the money this was a good solution for me to keep an eye on my family. I recommend it to anyone looking for an extra way to keep watch on their kids."
2,Limited Range,"Limited range and seems to be sensitive to interference, like from home wi-fi plus microwave. Picture quality pretty good for the price but figure on having the receiver close to the cameras."
4,Satisfied,Good value for the price. If you have wirless internet were you plan to install the cameras you may experience interference as I did.My Client I installed this for was pleased. (We had minor interference from wireless internet)
3,An avid reader of Christian Literature,"I did not particularly care for this performance. I like Spurgeon's work, but I did not think this had any particular depth. I would not buy it having seen it."
3,Interesting...But could be better...!,"This was somewhat a disapointment...I thought it would show Spurgeon how he might of sounded and looked (preaching) in front of a ""live audience""...etc."
3,Plodding but interesting,"For History Buffs,only those who like to read ""through the eyes of those who were there"" would enjoy this book"
4,Life as a street racer,"Do you like racing? Do you cherish it, live for it, and would you die for it? Well if so you have something in common with this book. You crave speed. The great thing about this book is how Lou Mathews puts a spin on this racing story to relate it to a persons life. The story takes place in L.A in the late 1960's. The main character a man named Charlie is the one who loves drag racing. Charlie loves racing so much that he sets up street races around L.A. Not much for driving himself but handling bets starting off the cars ect... Well life for Charlie is not just a picnic though. Charlie has other important things in his life he must handle with, but will these events in his life effect the game he so desperately loves? Will Charlie half to choose between friends and racing? Read and see! Note: I would recommend this book for mature readers due to language and content."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED!,This item was advertised as Extra Capacity but what I received was a standard battery and it will not hold a charge. DO NOT buy anything sold by sellcell110.
2,Bored me to tears,"I was very dessapointed of this movie, is all about politics and the jewish in Mexico, students having way too deep talks about the subject and families carring on their jewish traditions, was hard to keep watching to the end."
5,Wonderful & totally entertaining!,"I'm a ""dog"" person & I put a lot of time & energy into naming my dogs! People who hear me talk about them assume they're actual children because I give them ""human"" names! None of this ""Rover"" or ""Spot"" stuff for me...I give my pets first & middle names! This book was extremely diverse & comprehensive in their name sources..to the common everyone-knows-a-Max-or-Sheba names to the really unique ones! Anyone looking at getting a dog should read this..it truly has a name for every dog personality one could possibly think of! A terrific read & one I'd recommend to anyone!!!"
5,love this book for our pets names!,"I loved this book when I was naming our first dog! This was how I found a name for him, then each dog we got after that we used it again! I love how the categories are broken down for you. A nice thing to have when looking for the perfect name for your companion"
3,Good,"This book was actually purchased by me as one of the Christmas gifts to my two little granddaughters. They manage to bring home yet another stuffed animal everytime we go out shopping. They are continually asking me, ""what can we name him/her?"" So, I decided this book help us both. N. Burnette"
5,Truth in fiction,"As I read this wonderful book on my Amazon kindle I kept thinking how near to the truth it was. All along I thought that Bindoon and the notorious Keaney were fictional. Only at the end, reading the Afterword by Bruce Blyth was I made aware that Lesley had used a real place and name. I have read most of her books but found this the best so far. Probably because of the reality, as well as her great story telling. I would recommend it."
4,Trust Me,"The story told by Lesley Pearse holds your attention from start to finish. Although this story is fictitious it is based on fact and the stories of so many ""orphans"" sent to Australia. This is an atrocious part of both England and Australia's history and certainly makes you question the actions of the ""do gooders"" of that era."
4,"Glee filled, a snapshot in time of the Maestro","A chance to see some budding opera stars when they were at Julliard, giving recitals for Pavarotti, as he sits at a table. Pavarotti has difficulty articulating his opinions in English, but when he launches into song to demonstrate pianissimo, for example, it's priceless. For the last 1/2 hour, he takes questions from the audience, then he sings. Sit down with a glass of lambrusco (sparkling Italian wine) and enjoy."
3,not a very long video,"This master class took place at the end of 70's, when Pavarotti was still relatively young. The length of this tape is only 60 minutes, so you probably shouldn't expect a lot of ""teachings"" here from Pavarotti. His comments and suggestions seem to me brief.Program: ""E lucevan le stelle"" (Puccini: Tosca), ""Non so piu"" (Mozart: The Marriage of Figaro), ""Questa o quella"" (Verdi: Rigoletto), ""Di Provenza il mar"" (Verdi: La Traviata), ""Infelice"" (Verdi: Ernani), ""Una voce poco fa"" (Rossini: The Barber of Seville)At the end of the class, Pavarotti answered some questions from the audience, and then he sang ""Per la gloria d'adorarvi"" from Buononcini's ""Griselda."""
2,B-O-R-I-N-G!!!,"Just bizarre! There are few things to which are engaging at the beginning of this documentary, but not all that interesting. I believe the power-outage was just a little too long - but gave an idea how long these situations occur AND what happens during them. The dancing and singing is worth a slight giggle. Not narrated, which makes for a boring couple of hours."
4,Mento Mania,"Nice intro to the nascent Jamaican music scene goes well with a warm spring afternoon. Just be aware that the musicianship and recording quality are not up to that of the contemporary calypso scene in Trinidad nor the great ska bands of the '60s. Excellent booklet includes vintage photos, quotes from pioneer producers such as Ivan Chin, etc."
5,Works as designed,"Fitted this unit to a 2000 Mercedes-Benz ML320 and it works without a problem. A nice buy that saved me a boatload of cash, compared to buying a similar unit from Mercedes-Benz."
1,I still have not received a issue.,"I love the magazine, but I have not been able to renew a subscription in over two years. I have paid $44.95 twice, I have a check that cleared the bank, but never received a issue, I sent a credit card number later for the same amount and never received an issue. I charged your purchase and still have not received an issue. I think part of the problem is they have not updated my mailing address. If it ever starts coming, it would be rated a five star."
1,Do not waste your money,"I would give this zero stars if that were an option. I ordered this magazine in November of 2011 as a gift for my son-in-law. As of May 2012 he has never received an issue of the magazine. I have submitted a report through Amazon to the subscription service three times. I've been told via e-mail that the magazine and replacement copies have been shipped; however, still no issues received. Also I've been to the post office to request that the magazine be tracked. This is an expensive magazine subscription and a rip off. SAVE YOUR MONEY. Unfortunately, I paid $ for a service/product that I have not received, and attempts to resolve the matter through the subscription service are futile."
1,Chintzy and tacky frame!,This frame is gauche! It is chintzy and cheaply made. I sent mine back. The pictures don't look very good on the screen. Poor resolution. I have seen nicer regular frames at the Dollar Store. I hope this helps!
2,Good But Not For Long,"I have had this item for almost a year. It worked fine for several months then the battery started messing up. It is rechargable within the unit and cannot be taken out and replaced. What started happening was that after the unit charged completely the unit would turn on all by itself and run the battery down. I would charge it, put it in my purse, and then when I took it out to try to use it, it would not come on since the batter was dead. It took me some time to figure out what was happening. I called the company and they told me that since it was after my warranty had expired there was nothing they could do. I would have to buy another one. There is no way to get the battery out of the unit and replace it without destroying it, so I just bought a useless item. I am not too happy and will not purchase this item again. I will be looking for something where I may replace the battery if needed."
1,Don't waste your money,Basically both hardware and software on this thing are poor. You can see individual pixels which makes the images blocky. Doesn't always recognize the JPEGs on my cards. The sound quality is mediocre at best. The finish is cheap and plasticky. I returned it the very day I opened the box. It is a pity that you can't play music as the photos are being shown. You can only do things one at a time.
3,Does the job,"Resolution is not great, but you can certainly see the pictures. We tried using full resolution pictures (multi-megapixel) and slimmed down pictures, but they looked the same. The pictures from our SLR looked much better (less pixelated) than the point-shoot camera. Not sure why that's the case.The buttons are a bit small. We actually bought this as a gift for my grandfather, and he has a difficult time flipping through the pictures. I wish there was something as simple as the iphone picture viewer at a reasonable price. That is what we were looking for...."
4,Very nice.,"I'm very happy with this product for viewing pictures. The screen is large and looks great. The menu system is easy to navigate.I had some trouble viewing .AVI files taken with my digital camera- They have some horizontal lines through them. I did not try to troubleshoot this at all- I may be using an incorrect video type or something simple. However, I didn't plan to use this item for viewing videos, so I don't mind this problem."
2,digital photo frame,i was disappointed in this product. it's slow with showing the pictures. the quality of the pictures are not great. i would look to another product than this.
1,A disappointment,"I'm reviewing the second unit I've had. I returned the first one because of static on the display, but the second one exhibits the same problem, and other reviewers have reported it, too. Summary: Static on the screen, EXTREMELY slow performance, doesn't show AVIs at all, can't play MP3s while viewing photos. It's a barely-adequate display for JPGs. The only reason I'm not returning it (again!) is that it's fine to leave on my desk at work, and cheap enough that I don't worry about it."
2,Digital photo frame,"This is a product that should be looked at before purchase. The screen resolution is pretty poor and the ""operating"" system is very simple and hard to set the way you want it. This product has an automatic slide show mode and normal / stretch display -- but the stretch display distorts the pictures too much and the slide show mode drops out when you make any adjustment. Also, the unit freezes up from time to time, requiring a reboot. Overall, this product is much less than I expected."
4,Nice for the price,"This was a gift for my mom,and I put over 300 pictures on it for her and she loves it. This is with a 1GB memory card though. It has an MP3 feature on it that we have not figured out yet. She is happy with just the pics for now though. The price was unbeatable and I shopped around."
3,Digital Photo Frame,"This is a great digital photo frame for the price. I bought this for my mother and the only drawback is that it doesn't automatically rotate pictures that are taken vertically with the camera, so my mother sits and rotates the frame according to the picture. This is a major drawback and I wouldn't buy another frame that didn't do this."
3,It's OK but not great.,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift and sad to say that they had to give it back to me to exchange since the first unit would not even power up. After I got he second one, I decided to test it first before giving to the recipients. First thing I noticed was that SDHC cards do not work with this frame. I had to go out and purchase a regular SD card and I was then able to load in pictures. The pictures looked clear and vibrant in color. The idea of changing the face plate is great but it is fabricated of plastic, so to me the black face plate made it look very cheap. Not many options in user controls but easy to operate. I have better quality digital frames that are more user friendly and have better options in controlling the views of the images. I went for a cheaper model and I guess I got what I paid for."
2,"Good for photos, not for video","While the photo display portion of the frame works fine, the video functionality is sorely lacking. Videos do not always display correctly, frequently freeze the frame requiring a reboot, and the repeat function never ever works."
5,"Coby DP-102 10"" Digital Frame","This product was a good value for the price paid. Does everything advertised and, comes with two different ""frame"" choices."
3,"Good gift, but.....","The digital photo frame is a great item and a good gift. The transition speed is a little slow and it does not play mp3's while reviewing pictures. Overall satisfied, but a little disappointed"
2,Not recommended,This item is not at all user friendly. It was extremely difficult and time-consuming to figure out how to use. There was nothing in the directions to explain how to get the pictures from the card into the frame's program and it was not self-explanatory. Once the pictures were installed (using the memory card only) the picture frame worked really well but the setup was terrible!!!
1,Had To Send It Back,"I am glad I opened this to get it set up before giving as a gift, as it had problems and I had to return it:1. Stated resolution is 480x234, so I figured I would get good results if I resized images to 480x234. Nope. In 4:3 mode there are black bars on the top, bottom and sides. In 16:9 mode there are black bars on the top and bottom and the photo is smooshed. Coby phone support could not tell me what resolution I should use.2. Slideshow would only step through images one time, and then stop on the last image. I tried 2 different USB flash drives, but it made no difference. Coby had no solution.3. Remote came with a dead battery.4. Sent Coby and email with these questions, and they never responded, so I finally had to call and they did not resolve anything."
4,Good Value - Basic Photo Frame,"I am very satisfied with the COBY DP-768. It is a basic photo frame that provides all that I require. The set-up is not terribly intuitive, but not too bad. I did find that I had to experiment quite a bit in order to get my photos to properly fill the 16:9 frame. I ended up cropping my jpeg photos to 700 x 460 pixels (that is 8.75"" x 5.75"" at 80 pixels/inch). I set the frame to 16:9 format, and then set the image to ""origial"" size. This worked for me, but I don't fully understand why these dimensions don't equate to a 16:9 display proportion. I also don't understand why photos cropped to match the instruction manual display resolution of 480 x 234 pixels did not work well for me. At those setting, the image did not come close to filling the screen. I feel that the instruction manual was lacking in describing the process required to properly crop photos to an acceptable format. My camera only takes images in 4:3 format, so some tinkering was required."
2,Info noone has but Colby,"Checked reviews everywhere but noone seems to mention some VITAL details. Here is the details from Colby Electronics Corporation on this DP-769* 7"" Widescreen TFT LCD @ 480 x 234 <-- Resolution NOONE has* File Format Support: Photo - JPG, Audio - MP3/WMA, Video - MPG/AVI/XviD* AV Output for use with Home Theater Systems* Removable Memory Support: SD, MMC, MS, xD, CF, Full-Size USB (Host)* Integrated Stereo Speakers* Wall Mountable Design with Detachable Stand* Unit Dimensions: 10.25"" x 8.75"" x 2.24"" (WHD)SPECIFICATIONS:* Display Type: 7"" Widescreen TFT LCD @ 480 x 234* Contrast Ratio: 300:1* Brightness: 250 cd/m2* AV Output: Composite Video, 3.5mm Headphone / RCA Stereo Audio, Integrated Stereo Speakers* Power: 100-240V UL AC AdapterACCESSORIES INCLUDED:100-240V AC Adapter & Detachable Stand & Remote Control & Two Interchangeable Acrylic Frames"
2,The Colby DP-758 is Almost Fair.,"Don't waste too much time editing, because the pictures only look as good as what you pay for...a fair quality low resolution image."
2,"poor image quality, long transistions, but easy to use","I was very concerned about image quality, and read multiple reviews before ordering this product. It was very inexpensive, and looked so when I plugged it in. The image looked faded, like their was a film over it, just not clear and sharp, not vivid. And I had it plugged in and looking at it from about 6 feet away. Also, many of the transitions are very slow, and don't allow you to see the photo during the transition. If I could have cut out all of the transitions altogether I would have been happy to! Would not buy this product, am returning it as we speak.On the positive side, it was very easy to use, I was up and running in 5 mins.Unfortunently think I am going to have to spend over $100 to get what I want."
1,"Works fine, but screen resolution is not as specified.","The product itself is fine. No complaints. The problem I have is that I bought this and a 1Gig memory card as a Christmas present for my parents. I put over 500 pictures of their grandkids on the card from the past 8 years and cropped each one to the dimensions specified on the box. Well it turns out that THEY'RE ALL WRONG! The purpose of cropping them was to avoid the black bars on either side of the screen. Now there are black bars at the top and bottom. Sorry mom and dad, but I'm not cropping 500+ pictures again! How crappy is that!?"
1,Double image & no tech support,The picture has a mirrow image over lap giving it a double image. Coby does not answer email and their automated phone answering system hangs up on you after 5 minute wait.
4,Almost Perfect,"Everything about this Digital Photo frame is great, looks neat, audio is good, picture quality is nice.*Two things missing are battery and power off switch on remote."
2,Mediocre Image,The Coby product produces low quality images and does not display all the images loaded.
4,Coby 7 inch digital photo frame,Seved the purpose for which it was needed. Using a stick or card makes using it quite easy. Satisfied with purchase. Bought another after using this one in a larger size because we were so satisfied with this one.
3,Coby DP-758 7-inch Digital Photo Frame,"I thought the frame would work by saving the pictures from the camera card. It doesn't. A camera card must be installed in the frame. I am not sure if any of the digital frames have that capability, but if one has, than I would have bought that instead."
3,disappointed with screen,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my parents. Product arrived on time and in good condition. I'm just disappointed with the screen. Everything looks darker then I expected and a lot smaller. Obviously that is what I get for ordering online and not viewing it in the store. However, I just want others to be aware that product is not all that exciting. Thankfully, my parents are technologically challenged so they were thoroughly impressed with it which I suppose is all that matters then and is also why it got 3 stars instead of 2."
2,Picture Quality is OK,"Picture quality is OK. But I have tried 3 different Coby digital frames and the SD card reader on the Coby frames cannot read any of my SD cards. I have tried multiple cards, but they cannot read any of them. The same SD card works in my camera, other digital frame and even in this Coby frame if I put it in an SD card reader and attach it to the USB port of the Coby frame."
3,Digital Picture Frame,"Still have not figured out how to get the song to play at the same time the pictures do...should be way easier than this! I like the remote and the swappable covers, but the ease of use is just not there and this is a gift for my parents, who don't like technical things...so was trying to get it all set up for them. Not overly happy."
3,Elder Viewer,I don't think you can turn this item on or off with the remote. There is no internal memory.
4,Great Value,"This is a great Value- I can only get 2,000 pics to show even though 15K are loaded on 2G SD. Would be nice to have like Svideo input/wifi,power stby on/off from remote. Few other kinks like random not pause...otherwise picture is great - audio works nice - havn't tried video's"
2,don't waste your money,I bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it. The price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out (displaying blue and green pixels). I did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a USB port but that is about all. Overall don't waste your time and money!
1,Not Satisfied,"When I purchased this digital frame I was unaware that I could not download pictures from my camera into the frame. It only works when the card from your camera is in the frame. Since I purchased this item as a gift and I took numerous family photos over the holidays, I now have to include the card from my camera and purchase a new card for myself. When I tried to return the item I was put on hold - twenty, thirty minutes at a time. I never got to speak to a person and finally gave up as I didn't have the time to spending holding. I am totally unhappy and will never purchase a product from Amazon online again. There has to be a better return policy and an easier way to make the return so consumers are not stuck with items they do not want."
1,coby digital picture frame,"This product did not work from the moment I plugged it in. I am in the process of trying to return it, we will see what happens."
4,Good digital frame,Working good so far. I didn't see anywhere in the specs. that you have to have an SD card. There is no internal memory on the frame.
3,La función aleatoria,"La función aleatoria no es la mejor, ya que en realidad parece que las fotos van apareciendo en orden, no exactamente consecutivo, pero tampoco aleatoriamente."
2,Limitied capabilities,"Aside from a clearly visible grid on the screen, the products has many limitations. To do a slide show of pictures, you have to have all the pictures in the same folder. Besides, you can not have more than 500 pictures per folder, or the last ones will not be shown. So if you have lots pictures organized in folders (like most of us do), you have to copy them into a same folder, which is very troublesome; and most likely you will have to split them in different folders of 500 pictures each, and every once in a while select a different folder. I wish there was a firmware upgrade so the product could randomly display pictures in any folder in a memory device. ...Oops, almost forgot, even though you have different options for memory devices, they cannot be more than 1GB in size or they wont work, another annoyance since nowdays is difficult to find devices of less than 2GB."
1,Es una porquería,"La imagen de este frame es pésima, se ven pixeladas las fotos, adicionalmente en 4:3 se ve la imagen muy pequeña y en 16:9 se deforma la imagen pues se ve alargada.Realmente me siento estafado...!!!"
5,good value for more than a digital picture frame,"other than a digital picture frame, it can also play mp3 and video file. the price can't be beat."
4,Mom loves it.....,All I can say is that my Mother loves this product and amazon had it at a great price. So we are both very happy.
2,Instructions needed,"I purchased this digital photo a frame as a gift. The plan was to download pictures and music stored on our computer to the frame. I read the vague instruction manual and after attempting to use several different USB cables I already had in my home I called customer support to get assistance. After two messages and three days later, with a combined wait time of over 90 minutes, I was able to speak with someone from Coby. I was told that since this model didn't come with the ""special"" USB cable I could order it for $8.00. It wasn't the price that was bad, it was the time it would take for it to arrive, approximately 6-8 weeks. Time I did not have since it was a gift. Long story short - I was unable to present the gift the way I had envisioned because there was no cable. The USB it requires needs the two ends to be the same size(most have a small end and a large end).- Poor customer support- Contents not adequate"
3,Not Bad But Its Picky,"Coby DP-768 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player and 2 Wood FramesFor the price I paid, it is good. The built-in speakers are loud and not tweeter pitched like others. . The con on this item though is that it does NOT play all forms of AVI video. For some of the avi videos I want to display, I have to edit and re-save them before they'll work...go figure.This item though, is not for hanging up high on the wall like a regular photo frame. You would be squinting to see if you do that. Instead, better suited fot a large desk or just a few feet away for easy viewing...so if you're looking for a wall-mount frame, I suggest getting a bigger than 7"". I hope this was helpful."
2,Overpriced and underwhelmed,"The pictures are not good. You can't adjust the color. If you load a picture before adjusting it (you wouldn't know you needed to adjust it unless you load it first), it won't save in the new format and you can't change the brightness/tone or whatever. The menu is slow and stupid and the frame overall looks cheap.This frame should cost $30 or less. Not what I paid here."
1,Poor customer service,"I've had several digital frames in the past. This product is grossly inferior to the others I've purchased. The slide show would freeze after only a few photos. I tried two different types and brands of memory cards (CF and SD) with different photo files on each, with the same freezing problem occurring each time. I tried twice to call customer service (good luck finding the number on the company's web site) and each time I was placed on hold for 10 minutes or more, waiting patiently while I was told what person in line I was. Both times, when I was 3rd or 4th in line, the system hung up and told me to call back later! I sent two emails with no response. I returned the frame and bought a brand I had purchased before. Stay away!!!"
2,Lousy Manufacture service,"The limited manual does NOT cover how to delete a picture. I tried the usual process (view the pic and hit delete or drag to trash on a Mac) The ""deleted"" pics no longer appear in the desktop folder but ARE in the CP-240. Called the manufacturer for assistance and was on hold three times. Finally got into a cue and was third in line when a recorded message said ""all agents are busy, call back later"" and hung up!"
3,Coby DP-758 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame,The unit is cheap but you get what you pay for.The same unit is available at other stores on the same day I receive it on the mail at about the same price.
2,Beware!,"Just to let everyone know, this frame DOES NOT accept SD HC (High Capacity) cards. For those of us with high-megapixel cameras that are going to that type of card, this particular frame is one you want to steer clear of.As an update...since this review has been ""blasted"" for being off-base, let me just say that is very difficult to navigate the specifications for these frames. There is a lot of info to sort through, and since almost any current SD card that isn't of the lowest memory is automatically a ""HC"" card, it is more to make sure the consumer looks at their SD card before purchasing. SDHC is not just an alternate version of SD, as I assumed. I'm not the smartest person I know, but I'm sure at least a few others new to this game have made the same mistake.My frustration is that any current mass-marketed frame SHOULD be made to include SDHC."
1,Remote not working,"I bought this product for my wife as a christmas gift. When she opened and set it up the remote came with this product was not working and I changed battery and tried, not good. I called customer service and explained to them. But they want me to send a $6.00MO for S&H for a new remote. We just took it out of the box and I din't understand why I have to pay S&H for brand new product. COBY spoiled our christmas happiness just a day after. very, very bad customer service and product support. Don't buy COBY products, product support is very, very, very BAD."
3,screen not that clear,it is not that bad but i have some small remarksthe screen not that clear and when the momery is full with pictures the slide show become slow other wise its good
2,Bad Technical Support,"COBY has the worst technical support ever. Thankfully the product interface is simple and if you try, and try and try again with file sizes, you do get to a reasonable end result, but if you try to call their technical support line, you will be very disappointed. They don't know their own product well enough to give clear guidelines on file sizes and resolution specs. Their only response is ""It's not a digital TV, so don't expect much"". Don't waste your time with a phone call to them, do your research on the web, even the info in this forum is more complete than at the COBY help line. I did buy and give 3 of these for Xmas, but I would never buy again from COBY and would tell others to avoid them too."
3,A Review of the Reviews,"I would just like to note that the ""Most helpful negative review"" of this product, is for a different product. Look at the product number that the reviewer is giving. It's a 7 inch rather than an 8 inch frame. I have not purchased this product, yet, so I cannot honestly give it a rating."
2,False/Deceptive Advertisement...,"I received this Coby DP-350 photo player item 6/25/2009. It was neatly packaged and as described. BUT ""DID NOT"" COME WITH THE BLACK LEATHER POUCH, shown in the pictures and descriptions, where ever you see this DP-350 advertised, including Amazon.Clearly false advertising. This handsome leather pouch is one of the reasons I purchased this item. What the heck Coby?? Also I can not play music & view photos at the same time, a feature I would expect to be understood. Coby advertises both music & photo, but not one mentions that you can not view pictures with background music at the same time, even in any of their manuals, they completely duck this issue. Again, What the heck Coby?"
3,"Coby DP1048-128 10.4-Inch Two Interchangeable Wooden Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player (Black, Brown)","If the frame actually was compatible with my MAC OS X, as it says it is, then I would rate this frame higher. I like the mat finish on the glass, the size is what I wanted, and the frame is nice. The marketing visuals on the internal memory are very good clarity, with the option to brighten or dim. I really wanted to keep this frame but could not get my computer to recognize it in my MAC finder. I plugged it into a friends PC, and it did appear to recognize the USB connection.This is the replacement frame, the first Coby CSR thought it was damaged some how and so Amazon replaced it without any shipping cost to me. Now this one is the same deal. Coby said they would have a technical person call me, but after a week of waiting, I contacted Amazon and they thought it best just to return it for a refund.Too bad for Coby and me, I like the product otherwise."
1,VERY UNHAPPY,I AM VERY SORRY I PURCHASED THIS ITEM.THE MUSIC DOES NOT PLAY ALONG WITH THE PHOTOS. VERY DISPLEASED.
2,A bit confusing!,I bought this frame for my elderly father-in-law. I thought it would be way too confusing for him to use. He is not very electronic savvy. It took me a while to figure out myself and I am know as the electronic nerd in the family.
2,below average,"I purchased this during Black Friday sales, and upon using the product (it was a gift for mom), I'd hesitate before purchasing again. I certainly wouldn't pay more than $60.1. Photo contrast and ratio is both poor, as noted in previous reviews2. Music and photos, as others also noted, cannot be played simultaneously; the product description is ambiguous on this point3. Interface, though not overly difficult, is not intuitive.All said, I got what I paid for, I suppose... it's certainly not for anyone looking for quality."
3,Wiidescreen aspect ratio means photos will be cropped,"Most of our digital photo library is comprised of pictures taken with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This frame is 16:9...so I had to spend HOURS cropping and formatting pictures to display properly on this device. Once that work is done, the frame works great."
2,Works but is very cheap,Got this as a gift for my Mother-in-law. It was a good price and seemed to have decent reviews. Out of the box I turned it on to load images on it and there was a pixel burned out on the screen. The build quality was very cheap. On the plus side I was able add and remove images easliy and it seemed to display everything ok with exception to the bright pixel mark on the screen.
4,Good Digital Frame for the money,I got this product as a gift for all of my groomsmen. They all loved it and have been very happy with the performance of the product thus far. All the bridesmaids were jealous that all they got was jewelry. The digital picture frame ust took the #1 slot for the must buy gift.
2,Maybe I expect too much,"I got this photo frame as a gift and it's the only digital frame I've ever used so I really wonder if I just expect more or if this thing is defective. All of the photos I put on it are super contrasty - to the point that I can't use black & white images at all and detail is lost in almost all of the pictures - faces are terribly washed out. Reds are really red and colors in general are just very wonky. Is this just because it's a digital frame and they're all like this or is it just this one? I get the horizontal lines through pictures from time to time that others have mentioned and I agree that it does not make sense that the music and pictures don't work together.Also, I wish Amazon would change the photo of the product because it is misleading. Even though the description says it's a 16:9 ratio that frame in the picture is clearly not 16:9."
2,"Great Picture, While it lasted....","Works great right out of the box. No real problems, but I never could get it to load an xd card. Totally confused my PC. I stuck a preloaded SD, turned it on, hit a few buttons and it ran a very nice slideshow. Has a great picture with very high resolution and brightness. I haven't tried any video or audio, but I bought if for my wife to keep pictures of the grandkids at her desk. It does exactly what I wanted it to.P.S.: Framed DIED 14 after 14 months. Also, when it worked, it seemed to like some SD cards, and not like others. . I won't buy another."
4,Best (almost) Mothers Day present,"My wife loved this ""gift"" from her 3 year old and 7 month old daughter as we were able to put all 2400+ photos of them on it, but the were some glitchy things irked me.1. I had to restart the frame in order to get the most recently added photos to be recognized.2. There isn't a ""repeat all"" function so after it goes through all the picts, it goes back to the menu and you have to hit slide show again.3. Since the card was formatted in FAT16 you could put all the pictures directly on to the root of the card and instead created a subfolder.4. Reformatting the card to FAT32 caused the frame to be sluggish and corrupted several photos."
3,Good value,"This is a pretty good value for the price. I got this as a gift for my grandmother. I also bought a Dynex 7-inch digital frame for my mother-in-law around the same time. I thought the picture was better on the Dynex even though they were both 480 x 234 resolution. The pictures also seemed to 'fit' better on the Dynex. My kids & I liked the transitions better on the Coby though. Both were very easy to setup. If I were to choose again though, I would go with the Dynex."
4,Good gift,Gave this to my step mom as a Christmas gift and she really enjoyed it. I had to show her had to use it as she isn't very tech savy but the manual would be sufficient for most.
2,Gift gone a little wrong,"I bought this for my mother-in-law for Christmas. She was really excited to get this frame, and I believe when I purchased it the ratings were a little higher. I can see that it isn't that great. We had to ship it back because there were some significant problems (it was showing any pictures and there were lines across the screen). We shipped it back and are awaiting the new one to arrive. I hope that it is much better. I gave it two because it seems like a good product, but the ratings could change depending when we get it."
5,Everything I needed and expected,"Thankfully I was just looking for a digital picture frame (no need for video or music) since the video feature does not work for me.For pictures, I'm thrilled. Quality is better than I expected since I feared resizing all my images to 480x860 would result in poor quality. It's plenty good enough for the price.I used ACDSee to batch process several hundred images. First I cropped to widescreen format, then resized to 480x860. I used an SD card for the photos.I few images suffered from the cropping (lost the top of peoples heads), but for the most part cropping didn't hurt too much. For those that were impacted, I just manually moved the crop to avoid cutting out content. I think I rather have a standard format frame though since that matches my camera.Overall, if you get a defect free unit, and don't expect to use the video feature, you should be happy with it."
4,Coby DP102 10-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo,"I think most of the reviews linked to this frame must be for older models. I bought this along with the Philips 8"" frame and for the ease of use, number of compatible memory cards and resolution the Coby was much better than the Philips. In fact, I just logged in to order two more for Xmas presents. The only drawback is the quality of materials for the frame. The Philips has a nicer design and feel.The resolution on this frame is 800x480. I put in a memory card from my Nikon D40x (10.2 MP) and displayed the slideshow. I was suprised at the quality. There were no issues with stretching or cutting off of pictures as described in other reviews. Since this was a gift, I didn't have a chance to test the video options but for the price you can't beat this frame!"
3,Could Be Much Better\Read This Before Buying,"The Pros: Visually the frame is nice when you first look at it. It does support a number of media types and file formats as documented above. The Cons: Not playing Audio and Video at the same time? Are you kidding? Why would you want to listen to an MP3 on these cheesy little speakers unless it was to compliment a slide show? The menu navigation is too difficult. It isn't very user friendly. It is 16:9, unless you want to edit EVERY photo (or shoot in this format), your photos will either be streched or you can view them in 4:3. If you view them in 4:3, you might as well go for a 5.6"" frame.Speaking of the 5.6"" - take a look at the Portable USA 5.6-Inch Digital Picture Frame on Amazon. It has all the Pros and NONE of the cons. The only problem I have with it is that I can't find the volume control for the MUSIC DURING SLIDESHOWS. It plays a few less formats, but does it very well. Navigation is simple!"
2,Not worth the $,"Spend the extra money for a better frame. It is very cheaply made, the picture quality is poor, and many times it goes blank or has lines in the picture."
4,Good with a little compromise,"Well, the product is good for its price. But, the fact that the pictures do not fit your screen well irritated me initially until I found out a solution. You need a software to convert your 4:3 pictures to 16:9. The software I used is ""JS PhotoPrep"". You can convert all your pics at once. Once you download and install, check mark both ""Perform Crop"" and ""Perform Resize"". Select Crop ratio as 4X6 and ""Desk-view"" in Perform Resize with a High quality (for enlarging). Now use these pics on your Coby Photo frame. Once you get into the slide show mode, click the right arrow twice to get into the full screen mode. You should be able to see your pics coming on the full screen without distorting it. Hope this helps."
3,A little disappointed,"When I bought this I thought it would be a lot nicer than it was. The ""plastic"" seems very cheap and it says in the directions you can use a USB cable provided to download pictures however this model doesnt include a USB cable.It is a special size so you have to order it from them. Also I was under the impression that you could download photos and the frame would hold them but you have to leave in your memory card from your camera. Not very convinient.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,Good inexpensive digital frame,"Overall this is a nice digital frame with basic features. The picture is average, and standard aspect pictures don't take advantage of the frame's wide screen format, but it's a nice cheap frame."
5,Digital picture frame,Awesome product. It did exactly what was advertised plus more. I am very pleased with the frame.
1,Very difficult to navigate!!,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my mother and I feel terrible!! Navigation is so difficult and frustrating!!! Scrolling back and forward is very hard, the buttons just get stuck ...we keep pressing and nothing happens!! uggghhhh"
1,terrible,bought this framework and it was great - for 3 months. Then it just stopped working! I'll never buy anything else from Coby.P.S. I gave it 1 star only because Amazon won't allow a 0 star rating!!!!
3,Wish I would have gotten the Kodak,Its okay. Its just a cheap product and thats what you are paying for. LCD is fuzzy. Colors are kind of weak. Construction is kinda cheap. Wish I would have gotten the Kodak. ITs not all jeers but I am just kinda disappointed. However this is a prime example of getting what you pay for.
1,Horrible picture quality!,I bought this last January--I am very disappointed in it. Picture quality very bad--grainy and out of focus
4,Cost/benefit is good,"Low price, good enough product.Good: design, interface, remoteBad: when is switched off, there is still light blurr on display (in dark room you can see it) - disapears, if you unplug from electricity. When you poer on device, you have to choose inpute and press some buttons to display images - would be nice, if could remember last settings and when you power on start where was ended."
2,worst digital frame,"coby digital frame dp758pros good looking ,and affordable .cons :it has usb port and a card slotpics need to be resizedwhen pics are taken from 10mp camera they look very dull on frameit takes long time to read the usb and card slotinfact usb thumb drive never workedonly the sample images which come with the frame look goodcoby website has least informationjust dont buy"
4,"FAST, CHEAP, & GOOOOD","The order shipped immediately, recieved on time, product in perfect condition as stated on sale. Given as Christmas gift and so far so good, thanks for the amazing price!"
1,Piece of Crap,"The resolution on the Coby DP-768 can be summed up by one word, SUCKS!!!!Plus none of the card reader slots worked! The only one I could get to work was the USB.The only reason we kept it was that it was a gift for my mother and she has NO CLUE how to operate electronics so I was able to set it up with a 4GB USB thumb drive with random pictures. And she assumes the next time I'm in town I will switch out some pictures for her. I begged her to let me return it, she said NO!PIECE OF CRAP, DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1,I have to resize every picture!,"I have a regular format camera, not a wide screen one.I could not find a way of setting display size in a way regular pictures look fine and fit well in this widescreen display.So I had to crop and resize the pictures before putting them into the frame. Otherwise pictures show as a small square in the middle of the screen.User manual says that you can update devices's firmaware but there is no such update in the support section of Cobys' web page.Very disappointed."
4,wow,"I have to saythis product i actually better then I expectednice picture , ok sound quality , its good they gave interchangeble face plates idont know about others but i dont like with white face plateoverall preaty nice product and the price rock`s"
2,False Information,"This was probably my worst investment on amazon ever. I've got nothing but annoyances from this digital photo album. I wanted to get something simple and easy to use for my girlfriend while she's traveling abroad, but I can barely get it to work right. Random pictures come out blurry, making it so you have to figure through trial and error which pictures will work and which wont. Also, the programming is so congested and slow that it wont let you skip through photos at will, you have to wait, which sometimes takes 30 seconds to a minute even with 5 sec slides. the buttons are plastic and flimsy. The button to make selections is the same to turn it off so it often ends up shutting off when you get frustrates because it doesn't make the selection you want.I only give it two stars because the picture quality is nice for the pictures that do work. It just takes a lot of work figuring out which ones those are."
1,VERY poor frame,"Anybody who rates this frame highly has not seen a decent digital frame. I got this one as a gift and though it would be fine because I got a 7"" frame for my mom for Christmas. (Insignia brand from Best Buy - which is pretty awesome.) And that frame tells me why I think this frame is total junk:1) resolution is too low. pictures look bad.2) resizing on or off - in 4/3 or 16/9 mode gives the pics a weird stretch... in junky low res.3) menus are ugly and poor.4) no internal memorySimply do NOT buy this frame. It's junk."
1,Dead after one hour,Worked great for the first hour then went completely dead. A nice product but overall people are having too many failures.
1,"No internal memory, you must provide your own","Buyers should be aware that this frame has no internal memory and can't be hooked directly to your PC. You'll need external memory (SD card, USB Flash Drive, etc) to view any photos.Of course, if you spend $10 and get a 1 gig USB flash, then spend some time formatting your photos to meet the frame's tiny 320 x 240 display resolution, then you can run a slideshow of hundreds, if not thousands of photos. But unlike most other frames on the market, this frame doesn't come with any way to remember your photos ... you'll need to provide your own memory."
3,Good stuff; can be improved,"Nice picture quality. The look n feel of the hardware is great.However, the thin plastic covering on the screen (which I believe is meant for protection) formed air bubbles which ruined picture quality. I wish it had a better covering."
5,Great Gift for parents,"I bought this as a gift to send back to the UK for my parents. Its fantastic, they love that i can send back an SD card with pics and videos and all they have to do is insert the card. Great value, and easy to use."
4,Very Good and feature rich photo frame,"It accepts several types of memory cards, as well as video/audio reproduction.Excellent in all areas.Could use other frame colors."
4,Should get 5 stars,This product is very good. Easy to use. Load your pictures and music on a memory card and pop it in. Why not 5 stars? It was a little pricey for my blood. I offset the cost with a gift certificate I received. That made it do-able. Have not tried the video feature.
5,digital photo frame,"We bought this 10"" Coby DP102 widescreen digital photo frame for my mother for Mother's Day. Our family is so spread across the states that she doesn't get to see grandkids or great grandkids very often, so we thought that we could all keep her updated on what is happening in everyones lives. We just send her SD cards full of new pictures and even she can use the simple frame. She is afraid of new technology, but we showed her how simple this frame is to use and she loves it. The picture quality is great and the remote is so easy to use. We would recomend this product to anyone who wants a digital frame."
2,Digital Photo,I was disappointed to learn that this frame does not come with memory! I should have read more clearily. We wound up purchasing a small jump drive so I could load pictures from my computer from a variety of years.
3,Widescreen can be annoying,"Of the 10,000+ pictures I could put on a memory card for display, only 100 or so (scanned in from negatives) fill this display sideways. For some reason I thought it would be OK for the majority of my digital pictures to be 4:3 instead of 16:9. Now I realize I am highly annoyed by the blank areas on the left/right left by 4:3 pictures. I am not going to change my format either because 16:9 is a huge waste of display when a lot of your photo art is taken portrait versus landscape.The random seems to start from the beginning (same seed) when you turn it off in the evening and turn it back on the next day, thus you see the same thing, over and over (i.e. I have 400 loaded on an SD card but see the same 60 or so during my limited viewing time)."
1,Not for Mac users,"Even though this product advertises that it will work on Mac computers, it won't. I tried connecting two different frames to a brand new Mac with Intel processor and to a PowerPC Mac. And I literally spent hours trying to get the product to work properly. It didn't. I finally had to return the frames. Mac users stay away from this beast."
1,Poor image quality,"Initially I liked the price-point on this digital frame. After getting it for a gift for my mom, loading an SD card with images, and then struggling through the non-intuitive UI on the frame, I finally got it to display a slideshow of the photos... and what I saw was an inferior quality! The photos are pixelated, and the resolution of the screen looks like a dot-matrix print-out.I should return the product, but it's for a Christmas gift, and it's too late. My advice: skip this one -- the field is too crowded to accept the inferiority of this product."
2,Grainy picture quality,"Diappointing picture quality. The online product overview states 'crisp picture', but I found it very grainy or pixelated (& I used high res digital photos from a new camera). It also had trouble reading 2 different SD cards, but I got it to work with the 3rd one. Manual is vague. Please note there are buttons on the top of frame to deal with the onscreen menu, although it looks like it should be touch screen. The frame is nice looking & has a nice finish. It doesn't look like wood, but it has a nice molded shape. Also has a small power brick. I'm returning the two I bought for gifts (drat)."
1,"Poor picture quality, even worse customer service!!","I purchased 3 of these frames for Christmas gifts based on the affordable price. The idea was to pre-load the frames with photos to give to our family, since we won't be together for the holidays. When I received the frames, I was really disappointed in the picture quality, but was going to keep them until I had trouble with the interface and horribly vague manual. I am a pretty tech savvy person, and all I wanted to accomplish was have our photos start up when you plug in the thing. Everytime you turn the frame on, you have to select about 5 prompts to get the slideshow started. I called Coby to see if there were other settings, and they emailed me instructions on reinstalling a MP3 player....nothing about the frame. I returned all three and purchased the $99 Westinghouse frame instead, which works like a dream, and has lots of settings to customize viewing the images..."
4,Good value for the price,"I had been wanting a digital frame for over a year, but couldn't justify over $100. I was thrilled to see this one for $60 and have been very pleased with the setup and picture quality."
2,Image Quality,"Most of the pictures are washed out in the display, unless they were really dark to begin with. Some of our sunset shots look good, but old family photos - which look just fine in our other digital frame - are way too bright on this one. There is no brightness control. I would NOT recommend this frame for general photo display."
2,Cant beat the price but manual lacks,"When your looking at your pic and it is completely the wrong size hit the right arrow button twice and it will go into ""full screen"" mode.If you don't know that you will probably be super disappointed by the way none of the pictures ever fit the screen despite if you size them to the ""output"" resolution."
1,Not Worth Purchasing!,"I was not impressed with Coby DP-102 10"" Widescreen Digital Photo Frame. It can only read up to 2 GB memory card. It accesses the memory card very slowly and there are a few software flaws. One of them is that when you rotate a photo, you will not be able to save it. Furthermore, it does not support Mac OS X (I called the tech support to verify). I believe they still need to further improve this product."
3,Digital Photo Frame,"I purchased a Coby DP-769 Digital Photo Frame, and returned it, as I was disappointed when receiving it. It does not allow you to play music and view photos at the same time. That was my error, as I failed to completely read through this models description before placing my order. I in turn ordered Coby model DP-562, which had the play options I was originally looking for. I have never been disappointed in any of the merchandise I have purchased on Amazon.com and the items have always been promptly shipped."
3,OK but not great LCD picture frame,"This display is poor compared to the panels costing around $180, but it works OK, and from several feet away the images are acceptable. Note that this display has no built in storage, so you must provide a memory card."
2,Sooo not user friendly,I was so excited thinking I had gotten a real score with the low price on this frame. I should have remembered you get what you pay for. This product isn't user friendly at all. I hate returning stuff so I tried to call Coby's customer service twice. Both times the message stated that all their representatives were busy and to call back. I won't buy any products from them again.
1,I don't recommend this product.,"I was not able to get this photo album to work like it was advertised. So, after getting my electronic-expert grandson to check it out without success, I returned it."
2,went dead in three weeks,This was easy to set up and showed a very good slide show. never tried the mp3 but totaly quit working after 3 weeks and will not power up. i am waiting on a solution from amazon ( will not do anything ) or tiger direct whom I baught from through amazon.
1,Coby DP-102 is Lacking,"On the surface, the Coby DP-102 Digital Photo Frame looks as nice as any other Photo Frame in the price range. All the advertised features are present.My one complaint (and disappointment) is that even though the screen size can handle pictures in 4.3 and 16.9 sizes, if a photo is not taken in the 16.9 format it will not be displayed as such. The picture will look distorted.Other Digital Frames in this price range have a feature that lets the picture fill the frame without distortion. I would recommend a prospective buyer look for a Digital Frame with this feature."
1,"Initially happy, now dissapointed - broken in 18 months","Initially this was a great deal.. Worked well, it was a gift for my mother.After 18 months of use, she gave it back to me. The screen had 4 dead pixels and flickered constantly like a badly tuned TV channel. The unit was buzzing and I noticed that near the on/off switch, the white plastic had a yellow/brown areas that apparently got hot enough to discolor and slightly melt.Unfortunately, its past it's warranty. Additionally, I'm very concerned that it began to melt near the on/off switch. Perhaps it was best that it failed before it caught on fire and burnt down my mother's house.Stay clear of this frame. Choose a more reliable product from sony, westinghouse, kodak or another big player in frames."
1,No Customer Support,"In September I purchased three of these items for Christmas gifts. The screen turned orange in March and Coby was called for service. Since the item was purchased in September their 90 day warranty had expired and the picture frames could not be repaired or replaced.Ultimately, after less than three months of usage the picture frame was thrown in the garbage! I will not purchase this brand ever again!"
2,"Nice device, poor quality control","This ""brag book"" was almost exactly what I wanted as a gift for my wife. A color would have been more attractive for her, but you take what you can get. By the time I gave it to her and she used it a few times, she noticed that the buttons did not work reliably. You have to push the buttons many times before they worked, and it seemed they were getting worse. The return period was over, so we returned it to Coby. We are waiting for the replacement."
2,"Small Picture, difficult to load",The picture are on the frame was smaller than expected which is my own fault I suppose. The thing that bothered me the most however was the inability to easily transfer images on my computer to the frame. It's designed to take images off one of the memory cards you find on cameras but there was no way to move older images from the computer directly to the frame without extra hardware. I returned the unit and purchased a larger unit with the ability to transfer images directly from the computer for about the same price at a local H.H. Greg. The return process was exceptionally easy and quick. Much better than taking a unit back to the store.
3,Widescreen is more trouble,"The product seems nice. The quality of the frame was not that great. It was a little rough around the inside of them frame where it sould have been smooth, but not that noticable. It was pretty ease to use. But if you want your picture to be in widescreen then you have to jump through some hoops. I had to get an image program from the web and resize the images. Then you have to deal with some images beting stretched. You don't have to do this but if you don't all the images will not be widescreen and will have black on the sides of the picture and it looks kind of cheap. The instruction manual or the manufactures web site had nothing about resiging images."
3,OK frame for the price,"This picture frame is decent for the price. You have to buy a memory card for it to work, and uploading takes a little time and patience, but once it's up and running, it's OK."
2,Coby DP-758 - basic photo frame,"Purchased as a present for mothers day, but found the product lacked quality in sizing photos and limited to photos only. I own a Curtis brand photo frame which is far superior to this one. A very basic product."
3,Software,"I bought this product for my mother for mother's day. We had a hard time with the software. I have read other reviews with the same complaints. We finally realized that once you attach the device to the computer you have 2 options, USB charge or USB update. There are 2 arrows at the top, push the forward arrow to change from charge to USB update. Go to the middle button on the keychain press that, turn it on, then double click on the photo viewer icon and it should work from there. If not, unplug the USB port from the keychain... plug it back in and the computer should recognize the new hardware. Again, double click the Photo Viewer Icon and it should come up. Good luck!"
4,Digital Frame,This product is an absolutely great value. It is feature rich and the big screen is eye popping.
1,Horrible picture quality and not user friendly,"Compared to other photo frames I've seen / used this photo frame is the worst. The picture quality is horrible, the frame has none of its own storage and the operation of the frame is confusing. If you are comfortable with computers you should be fine, but I bought the frame for my parents and I know they'll never use it because of the fact that you can't just turn it on and pictures start playing.I would have returned it if I would have ordered it earlier and had time to buy a different one.Don't buy this item!"
1,Video Photo frame,Coby DP-769 7-Inch Widescreen Digital Photo Frame with MP3 Player & 2 FramesThis unit came without a instruction manual and there wasn't one on line. Makes this unit very hard to operate.
2,Hit or miss - depending what you're looking for,"The design and look of this picture frame is very nice. However, everything goes sour when you turn it on. The picture quality is so-so, but the limit of 500 pictures is really weak. The problem of aspect ratio is also an issue, but it's ok if you don't mind the black bars on the sides. I decided to return mine to Amazon because of the 500 photo limit. I really need more pictures to be able to be shown. My SD card can fit over 1500 on 256MB. It's a shame, I liked the sleek design of the frame."
3,hard to use,"Operation was not intuitive. Manual didn't match buttons as shown, yet says it is for this model. Tech support was impatient and hung up as soon as I said the unit was working - no chance to ask another question or even say goodbye. Would not buy other products from this manufacturer again."
2,Quality Poor,I expected the quality of the pictures to be similar to my computer screen and they are grainy at best. I wish I had known this before purchasing it for a gift.
2,I returned it (need I say more?),"I purchased two frames for christmas gifts, and I returned them as fast as I got them. The product per se is good, but the quality of the pictures was very bad. So bad, I needed to tilt it a little bit to see what photo was showing. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Didn't work right from the beginning :( thankful I bought it from Amazon, they refund the money right away, and paid for return shipping :)"
3,"large,clear picture with some shortcomings","This product is quite good for the price, However, it could use a small memory of it's own. The stand should allow various viewing angles. I often use something to prop the frame so that it can be viewed at it's optimum angle while the viewer is standing up. The interchangeable frame borders are attractive and I thought enough of the product to buy two more as gifts. If you expect a near perfect product, expect to pay almost twice the price."
5,Very good digital picture frame.,"This digital picture frame has a very good LCD display. As long as you resize your digital photos to match the resolution of 860X480, the pics. will fill-up the frame. One drawback is your original pics. will be cropped. My 1 Gb CF card can display over a thousand pics. Color and brigthness are still good even if you view it 6 to 8 feet. If you want you can change the frame to wood if you are handy. Overall I'm happy with this Coby DP102."
3,Good frame for the price,"Price was reasonable. Pictures display nicely and transitions were smooth with picture intervals from seconds to a day. Viewing angles were narrow, especially on the vertical. Lots of card slot choices. Keep in mind that this is a 16:9 frame, so you will want to format pictures accordingly. Recommended."
1,Never got the product,Company sayit shipped and I still cannot trace it using the UPS tracking numbers. UPS says tha the label was created on 01/11/2012 (that's almost 11 months ago).NEED MY PRODUCT NOW!!!!
2,Not a very good product,Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present and it had issues. Could not clean pictures off of the internal memory (and I'm an IT guy so I'm not completely illiterate when it comes to technology). I could however still use a memory card to load pictures. Then about a year later it just quit working. I would not recommend this product.
4,lovely product,i sent this item to my aunt like 5 years ago and its still there ..she loved it.. i need to get one for myself very soon
1,Awful experience,"It seems the product arrived with some problem because I cannot see a video file correctly. There is a delay in the video speed and the device stops after 5 minutes working without warning.As I bought it and only tested at home (Brazil), now I have this awful device looking at me without working and no technical support."
1,"Horrible product, worse warranty","The first one of these I received had something inside the picture frame that was rattling around loose and when I turned it on the screen was all wavy lines. I was able to return it to the seller, they paid shipping, and received another one at no charge. That one worked for about a month before it stopped working. When I tried to return to seller I was told I had to go directly to Coby as the sellers 30 day return policy expired. I contacted Coby and they want me to ship it back to them at my expense and to also include $10.00 for them to send me a replacement. Given their record with this item I doubt I'll get one that works for very long if it works at all. If in fact the next replacement did not work I can expect to continue sending them back at my expense along with $10.00 again. Horrible warranty.I'll never purchase another Coby product."
5,Excellent for Sharing Photos!,This is great! I photograph all the travels and wonderful memories. We have this in our living room. I download the photos on a flash drive. All I have to do is insert the flash drive and turn it on and a slide show presentation is given to see.This is excellent!
2,A little disappointed...,"I have purchased two digital photo frames recently. This was one of the two. This Coby frame is a little more difficult to operate and the photos are not very clear. However, this frame was alot less expensive. So I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Worst digital product I've bought,"I cannot get this to cycle through more than 6 or 7 pictures before it totally locks up and I have to use the reset function built into the back of the unit. Right now it's sitting in a drawer collecting dust, as it is useless to me. I bought this several months ago and have tried since day one to get help from coby but with no result. They only have an online support system with no live intellect behind it. I will NEVER buy another coby product again. I advise those who do, to keep your reciept and make sure you are able to return the product.It's been quite a while since I purchased this and still no help from Coby support. I stand on my original review about this product being the worst I've purchased and STILL will NOT buy any thing with the name Coby on it. I hope this company goes under and makes way for one that builds quality products and plans to support them. Let my $100 mistake be a warning to all not to purchase a Coby product."
3,Good for this pice tag....,Looks of this frame are decent .. 2 interchangeable face plates...Pixel resolution is not good but ok for long distance view...Images need to scale properly for proper view(use less than 70 kb images).Audio quality is good. Not All Video formats tried but avi files captured by canon camera were not supported.Lot of memory card options.Overall satisfied with product for price paid 40$.
2,"Terrible resolution screen, get what you pay for","I really wanted to like this photo frame, especially for the price. Sadly, it was not to be.The fact is, the screen is not that great. It's resolution makes any photo on it pixelated, and in slideshow mode you can barely tell what the pictures are you're looking at. The fact that it's ""widescreen"" makes it impossible to display any of your pictures properly on it; they must have had surplus DVD player screens sitting around or something.The fact is you can find nicer screens for just a bit more, so keep looking. I would NOT buy one of these again, fortunately I gave it away as a gift so I don't have to suffer with the thing any more.Recommended Alternatives:Pandigital 8.0-Inch LCD Digital Photo Frame with PanTouchPandigital 11-Inch LCD Digital Picture Frame"
1,"Glitchy, buggy, undependable performance on two units","First one arrived but did not display photos properly. The images were off-center so that the center of the photo was pushed down and to the right by about 2 inches. This pushed the far right of the photo to the far left of the picture frame and the bottom of the photo to the top of the screen.Returned it to Amazon and ordered a replacement.Second one arrived with the same problem, but the images were only off-center by about .75 inches. If the glitch in the units just shifted the photo down and to the right so that part of the photo was just missing or offscreen, I might not even notice or care for most of my photos, but the glitch pushed the image down and right but reproduces the ""lost"" part on the left and top, which really made it hard to look at the photos.I'm trying a different brand."
3,You get what you paid for,I bought this photo frame because of positive reviews but when i received it.I found out that the resolution was much worse than i expected.I knew that it had resolution of 480*280 but i had no idea that iit`d be so bad.So i returned it.
1,Looks are deceiving,"I ordered two of these digi-frames because I loved the specs and the look of the product. Boy, was I fooled. I'd planned to give these as gifts, but the device did NOT work as promised. It was good that I'd ordered two, so that I could determine if I'd just gotten a lemon out of one of them. Nope! Neither unit worked properly. I returned them to Amazon. Kudos to Amazon for an excellent return policy and procedure! I've since replaced these units with the Kodak M1020. Loved 'em! They worked as promised; actually, they exceeded my expectations. I'd give the Kodak digi-frames at least 4, and maybe 5, stars. Skip the Coby units."
2,spend a little more,"I bought one of these for a Christmas gift, loaded some pix and gave it to my Mom.First off, when you turn it on, it takes you to a menu. not a good thing for an 85 y.o. woman. But I finally taught her how to get to the photos.Not real intuitive.Occasionally, interference comes across the screen in the form of lines taking up about 1/5th of the photo. The plastic is a little cheesy too.My sister bought one for her mother in law and the unit was much simpler to use and much nicer looking. Spend a few more dollars, you'll thank me."
2,Not Impressed,"I am not impressed with this frame. I purchased it as a gift and gave it, but if I had ordered it for myself I probably would have returned it. It does not do a random show, so it will only play the pictures in the order they are saved on the card. Oh well. I own a frame around the same price from a different company that is much better."
2,Ok at the price,"Poorly designed casing affects the quality of the device - the LCD panel has better viewing from positive vertical angles, literally flipping the thing over greatly improves its viewability when placed on a horizontal surface with the included stand, but this requires all the JPEG files to be rotated by 180 degres.Otherwise its an ok device at the price."
1,IF YOU HAVE A MAC DON'T BUY THIS!,"I bought this for my parents and parents-in-law, to send them pix of their granddaughter. When I went to sync photos onto it with my Mac Powerbook G4, however, over half of the photos inexplicably failed to copy. I spent over two hours trying different solutions: renaming files, switching to tiffs, compressing photos to various sizes, I even tried a different SD card--no effect. Finally, I found that copying each file individually, and trying over and over even when it failed, would eventually work. But considering it took three or four attempts PER FILE, this was profoundly tedious--and even though the pix worked, on the Coby display itself, half of the images were marked as INVALID. I don't know if this is a problem with all digital photo frames but I tried this on two Cobys (I bought one for each set of grandparents) and I had the exact same problem. I also tried to sync with my wife's (new) Macbook Pro and had no better luck."
1,Not What It Says!,"I bought this for my Dad as a WMA player - the photo album was a bonus. Well, I couldn't get WMAs onto it and when I contacted Coby customer service about the problem, she said, ""Well it's really not made to be an MP3 or WMA player - it's a portable digital photo album."" She was no further help - I'm returning it to Amazon!"
1,Bugs not worked out yet,"I was unable to upload photos onto the frame from my camera. I called the company and they informed me that this feature does not actually work. When I pointed out that the manual describes how to do this, they repeated that this is not actually possible.So I got a USB cord and tried to load photos straight from my computer. That didn't work either. So I returned it.It is a pretty and affordable frame, so if you can figure out how to get photos onto it I'm sure it is wonderful. If you can't, don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Wrong choice,"Turns out I got the wrong item; she wanted one that took batteries. Never told me that but I'm still in the Dog House. Move over, Tiger Woods."
2,"Decent phone, bad caller_id",I just returned this phone after owning it for two weeks. The actual phone was decent enough...good layout and good sound. What I hated was the caller_id...for some reason the caller_id only displayed after two or three rings...way too late and not much time before the phone rolled into voicemail.I called Panasonic 1-800 about the slow caller_id and they admitted customers complained about it. They gave me a few setting to try changing on my phone. I performed the suggestions but no change for my slow caller_id...so I returned the phone...
2,caller ID (where are you),"I reacently purchased this phone and am going to return it because the caller ID works half the time at best. I called panasonics tech support 3 times with no avail. I had a full charge in the battery and when I took it out it lost its charge immediately,(whats with that?).Oh by the way it only took 24 hrs to recharge it,yes you heard me right 24 HOURS.The sound quality was very good, speaker on hand set work well, but in lieu of the things I mentioned this baby is going back to the store."
1,Worst phone ever,"I bought this phone because I liked the features and I trust Panasonic. My panasonic products have always performed very well. However, this is the worst phone I have ever owned as well as the most expensive. The battery life is horrible and there is no warning it is about to die. The battery meter can show a full charge and then after just a short while you will be cut off and the phone will be dead. It doesn't even give you a warning beep. Panasonic owes an apology to anyyone who has ever purchased this phone."
2,Nice feature set but poor implementation,"I've owned Panasonic phones pretty much for the last 10 years and they've all been great. When I saw the verbose feature list on this phone plus the 2.4Ghz range, I jumped.I liked the cell phone like approach to storing numbers, though the interface is quite clunky. Sometimes it's hard to figure out your way back to the main menu.Anyway, the main beef I have with this phone is battery life and construction quality. I've had the phone for less than a year and the battery has reached the point where it starts beeping after having one conversation on the phone. This is unacceptable. For some reason, the LCD panel has gotten so faded that I can barely read it without extreme darkness. I tried to adjust the contrast but nothing happened.Luckily I bought this phone with a 2yr replacement warranty at Best Buy and I'm returning it and its accessory phone to get a better system.I was very happy with the features but the promise was greater than the execution."
1,Caution!! - DON'T WAIST YER MONEY!!,"My biggest gripes. The batteries don't last worth @##$@!@!. The meter always reads that it's low. And, you slightly bump the handset it comes on, preventing anyone from reaching you and draining the battery. You can't carry this thing anywhere... your guaranteed to hit one of the buttons indiscriminately. One of my handsets refuses to work... no matter how many times I reprogram (reset) it fails to recognize the base. I'VE HAD IT WITH THIS THING!!!"
1,Don't be fooled by the cool looks......,"The phone does look cool-better than the previous models. The battery life on the handset is pathetic. All night charge may get you 10 minutes of talk-time, if you're lucky. Defeats the purpose of buying a cordless phone altogether. Caller ID does not work properly, most of the times."
1,"Terrible, terrible phone","Horrible battery life. Returned the first one after a week, but second one was no better. Constantly needs charging and even then I'm lucky to get 1/2 hour of talk time. My old Panasonics were incredible - with regular use I could go 4 or 5 days without charging. Sadly, I don't think the 5.8g's are any better."
2,Disappointing so-so phone from Panasonic,"I've had this phone for over a year.The Panasonic batteries are the biggest problem, because they fail after short periods and can be very expensive. (As another review suggested, I'm now trying the Energizer NiMH replacements, but it's too soon to tell.)Also, the additional headsets are markedly overpriced.Otherwise, sound quality is fair to good. It's poor when 2 people are on different extensions. Also, when on speakerphone, voicemail systems seem unable to hear the touchtones at times, so one needs to switch to using the handset directly.We're still using these phones, but obtained a new set from Uniden (with which I've had much greater success) in case these give us further trouble. Would recommend avoiding this series of Panasonic phones."
2,handset dies,I have had two of these where the handset has just died in a matter of weeks. I just read the other comments with the battery life issue but dont know if that is what caused the failures. Other than that the phone is reasonably good and its speakerphone handset feature is pretty useful (though the sound quality is sometimes questionable). Its still a little unnerving to have two of these reasonably expensive phones just malfunction within weeks.
1,Belkin Fails Again,"OK, so I have the previous 450 VA model, but it just failed on me causing a power outage. The battery failed, and power just went out. The next day, the battery bad indicator starting beeping but TOO LATE. For an uninterruptible power supply to cause a power outage is just unacceptable.Everything I have gotten from Belkin has been poorly designed. I replaced with an APC. They seem to have a clue."
2,Not very reliable,"Had two of these at work crap out and die within a year of each other. All our UPS units are Belkin and we've had issues, greater or smaller, with all of them. These F6H500s in particular died with no warning, under no undue circumstances (lightning strike, etc) and when that happened there was absolutely nothing I could do with them. There was no self-test, no blinking lights. Dead. They became expensive 12-pound bricks."
1,software issues,"I bought 12 (yes 12) of these to protect all my computers. The fact is that they all work really great if your gonna skip the software (although the software is what properly shuts the computer down before the battery dies). On every single one of them, the software will lose connection with the UPS after a few days rendering the software useless. The only way to fix this is to shut everything down, turn the ups off, unplug the ups for a minute, plug it back in and boot everything up again. This will give you a few more days. Being that I never shut my computers down, this sucks royally. It happens to ALL 12 on different machines so that confirms a design flaw in this unit. I look for a bios update to possibly fix the problem often, but no luck on belkins site. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!"
1,"NOT USB, and NOT XP compliant.","If you care about USB (rather than serial) and you care about it 'just working' with your windows XP, then buy something else.I got sent the one with a serial cable, and some terribly poor software.I used windows XP's UPS control panel (power management) and I think I had to say it was an APC serial device.No idea if it's doing the right thing - my confidence is low with this product.However, if you don't mind serial, and running other s/ware - it's probably OK."
1,"NOT USB, and NOT XP compliant.","If you care about USB and XP compatibility, don't buy this.Otherwise, go for it."
3,Would have gotten more stars if...,"OMG when I saw this I was happy to see some classic Disney cartoons that I watched as a kid back when the Disney Channel rocked and before it became a shadow of its former self. This DVD/streaming video were great for the memorable shorts I use to love back in the day. The reason I gave it three stars is because half way through the video, the editors decided to fill the rest of the time with shorter versions of the episodes on the DVD as well as add a strange music video in the end. What were they thinking? I will not buy another one until they decrease the price. If they are going to do that, then it is only worth 3 dollars max. Who wants to see the same episodes of show they just saw but shorter in length. That was a stupid choice on Disney's part. They could have added more content other than that. Anyways, I recommend it if you like Donald and Mickey but be warned of the crackpot editing and lame music video at the end of the first 39 minutes or so."
4,One-of-a-kind Find,"We found this book long before we lucked onto the pediatric endocrinologist who told our young son to stop eating sugar. (And said, ""Of course there's hypoglycemia."") With two members of our family needing alternatives in this world of sugar fixation, this is the only cookbook we've found to help. All others assume it's about diabetes, when it's really about living and eating happily without sugar."
3,Low Sugar perhaps but high in fat,"My husband purchased the book so we could start eating more healthy and start watching our sugar intake. I was surprised that there was no nutritional guide included for any of the recipes and some look to have lots of added fat in them; ie half & half, cream. I don't want to replace the sugar with fat. I do like the simple format of the recipes and that they include some recipes that really resonate with my kids. I also liked the fact they included oat flour, flax seed, and wheat germ to the recipes. If you are caught up on knowing calorie breakdown this book is not for you but if you are open to new recipes using fruit sugars then you will enjoy this book."
3,the low blood sugar cookbook,Didn't have as much info about hypoglycemia as I hoped. The recipes still have other forms of sugar in them such as different kinds of juices. Not really what I was looking for.
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money buying this book if you already know how to put peanut butter on a stalk of celery. It has a few useful recipes but most of it is just filler. I found Krimmel's other book ""The Low Blood Sugar Handbook"" to be helpful but unless you wish to let hypoglycemia rule your life as Mr. Krimmel does look for something else. I would recommend the Insulin Resistance Diet for anyone who wishes to maintain a normal life not ruled by low blood sugar."
5,Charming 19th Century Cornish Folk Tales and Legends,"William Bottrell's (or Botterell's) book is an important contribution to the folklore of Cornwall. It was written in 1880 originally and captures folktales that were vanishing then. Without this books, and a few others, the priceless treasure of myth and legend of Cornwall would be lost to us; it would be a worse world without it. Since the stories are all relatively short, this is an easy book to pick up and read what you will, lay it down, and come back again. I have read these stories several times, and find something of value on each visit. Bill Rowe"
2,a lot of wailing,not my type of music after all - the are trying too hard to be something they are not. Mayans would have laughed as would any other indigenous group they are trying to imitate
5,Pure NYHardcore,"Dude, these guys go off and if you don't wanna break somethingwhen you hear this your lame. Fast, in-your-face, New YorkHardcore. Peace to Raybeez and Warzone."
1,no talent,"these guys suck, they need to learn just a little technique. they rip off so many nyhc bands out there. oh and lou was much better with subzero"
3,NY thugcore,Provide the pit and this CD will provide a severely angry mosh all over your head. This the kind of stuff you mosh-steady to. Nothing fast. Which can get boring. I suggest DMS before this.
1,Not very useful,"If you need a guidebook that will help you plan an itinerary, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! This book, while chock-full of information, gives no practical tips whatsoever about how to arrange activities while touring. I read through it twice and came away with snippets of information but nothing that helped with actually planning how my family would spend each of our four days in the city. The index is incomplete and much of the information is sketchy at best. I would NOT recommend this as a resource, especially for first-time visitors."
3,The Walt Disney World's guide is much superior,"The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World is excellent, the best Disney guide, specially for it's details. I wanted a New York guide, so I guessed this would have the same quality. I was wrong. It doesn't comes close. Fodors is a better choice with more useful information. The Unofficial also needs a more careful update. It's written that I could find a Warner Bros store at Columbus Circle, but the Warner stores closed many years ago. Fortunately I was already well informed."
1,Official Disappointment,"Unlike other titles in the series, the Unofficial Guide to New York City doesn't have suggested touring plans or ""must see"" lists. The restaurant desciptions are lacking (for example, there are NO restaurants listed on 9th Avenue Midtown and there are NO restaurants on the Chinatown map!). There is a brief introductory chapter on the history of the City and that is worth reading."
2,Not a reliable source of info for travel to NYC,"My family recently went on vacation to a couple of cities, such as Washington D.C., Philadelphia, NYC and Boston. I really found the information in The Unofficial Guide to Washington, D.C. to be immensely useful in planning our 5 day stay there. The guide was filled with useful information about touring tips, and we planned our itinerary accordingly, saving much time and effort in the process.""The Unofficial Guide to New York City"" on the other hand was utterly disappointing - there were no touring hints or strategies, and the information also seemed all over the place. The restaurant guide appeared incomplete, not covering certain sectors of the city, and on the whole, this guide was not a reliable tour guide of NYC. I also used another guide, Frommer's, and found that much more useful. Pass on this one."
2,ear bud only problem,the setup is nice and the on off button on the mic is perfect. the only problem i have is the earbud. it just doesn't fit good.
2,Big Ears/Loud Mouth Required,"I purchased this product before reading the product reviews on this website, and it was a mistake. In order for the ""ear bud"" to remain in your ear, you must have truly large ears. If this is not bad enough, you practically have to eat the microphone in order for the person that you called to hear you clearly (and I am not known for talking softly).Try another product."
2,Bug in the Bud,"I purchased the Samsung Ear Bud for my Samsung 3500 and within a month the Ear Bud had a short in it. I have problems with people hearing me. With the changes in the laws regarding talking and driving, I'm forced to repurchase another Ear Bud, but which one?"
2,Disappointing,"I should preface my review by saying I am new to Samsung phones and the only thing I care about is clarity of the incoming sound. I had been using the Nokia 5160 with the garden variety in-ear bud for 3 years with very happy results -- the incoming sound was comparable to having a landline phone receiver next to my ear. By contrast, the Samsung OEM bud used with ny new Samsung R225 phone is a disappointment. There is a huge difference in sound quality between holding the phone next to my ear versus listening through the earbud. The latter sounds as if I had water in my ears -- muffled, faint -- I can barely hear while I'm driving, which is 75% of the time that I use my phone, so this is a real problem. Will explore the (new?) Plantonics M205 option and hope it's better..."
2,"Sounds great, but I'm in a box","I have had no problems keeping the earpiece in my ear, but almost every person I have talked to says they can hardly hear me or I sound like I'm in a box! Sorry Samsung, this is a poor product -- look for it on the auction page!"
1,"avoid this ear bud, bud",The ear bud is large and only fits people with large ears. I had a problem with the piece remaining in my ear during casual conversations. When I was driving it would drop out with the slightest head movement. They should offer several gel earpieces of various sizes so people who don't look like the elephant man can also use them.
3,Microphone pick up isn't strong enough,"I like everything about the hands free operation, but I'm having to shop for another head set because the people I talk to complain that they can't hear me well enough. To talk to my mother, I even resorted to clipping the shirt clip up in my hair so the microphone would dangle in front of my mouth. Then, she could hear me OK. Unless you want to yell while talking on this head set, you'll probably be better off with a boom microphone style of hands free headset."
5,No show-through with t-shirts!,"I have tried everything from adhesives to silicone gel covers and these work the best so far. Not only do they prevent the high-beam look, but the discs do not show through, even with white t-shirts. While some of the silicone covers are thick enough to distort the shape of your breast, these are thin and look natural. They are meant to be placed inside a bra and take longer to position than adhesives, but are MUCH easier to take off. The only drawback is the material, which is rubbery, but the effectiveness of these discs is outstanding."
1,no,"Can't wear it with white shirts, make you look like you have giant nipples and with certain shirts you can see the outline of it. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Work well,"These work, and work very well! I can now wear T-shirts with confidence. But take them off slowly--they do stick to your skin, as they should."
5,LOVE These... They Absolutely Do the Job!!!,"Cannot believe I went my whole professional life wearing jackets because I was embarrassed that my nipples always showed under tees and tops. I am very pleased with this product, would buy more and would recommend to others. I do see where it pays to treat them like one would soft contact lenses as they adhere so well, they must be peeled off gently, petal by petal."
5,Life Changing!,"I know it sounds a little dramatic to say this little product is life changing but I have been wearing these discs daily for about 3 years now and can truly say: 1) They have easily solved an annoying and embarrassing problem, 2) They have given me the freedom to buy any bra I want without it requiring otherwise unwanted padding and 3) they have given me the flexibility to wear any type of top I want with or without a second layer. After over at least 1000 wearings I am finding I need to replace them as one of the flaps tore off and there is a rip in another. Well worth every penny! Whoever is getting rich off of these - good for you!! I only wish I had thought of them."
5,BRAVO,"BRAVO! What an awesome product! I am big busted (42-D)and have avoided padded bras since they add more inches. I have always struggled with ""show through"" when I wear my favorite T-Shirts. This product works wonders and does not show through my bra, let alone my T-Shirts (even white)! The discs stay in place and do not irritate my sensitive skin. Thanks for bringing us such an awesome product - I highly recommend it!"
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"Listen to ""And Me,"" ""Woodstock,"" and ""Tell Me Why."" Beautiful! I am so glad this album is finally available again -- downloadable. I bought the LP many years ago and loved it. Great to hear it again."
3,"cool look, great paint, poor shipping","I have been playing paintball for years, but i have just recently been buying my paintballs online, and from what i have discovered, Im better off buying my paintballs in walmart. I paid 60 dollars for 2000 paintballs. but in reality I paid 60 dollars for 1300 paintballs. NO JOKE, the time it took me to wash and dry these paintballs. its just not worth it."
5,mindcontroller is good,"this cd, is definitly worth buying if you are into happy hardcore. It is mixed very well with a nice selection of songs. I personally like the way he uses anthems, while throwing in songs you would not regualarly hear at a party. if you like a more nrg style of happycore then say anabolic frolic you have found it in hardcore energy 2001."
4,For the complete 242 collector...,"Tragedy For You >TWO< is most highly prized for it's limited release and stunning alternate artwork. The cd has an extra cut (another remix of Trigger) not found on the album or on the Tragedy For You domestic US release....comes in a slimline jewel case, with a wonderful picture sleeve and painted cd. ...needed by any collector of 242!"
4,Great Text,"This text is very well written and is easy to read and understand. I'm definately not a ""math person"", but this text begins at such a fundamental level and is so thorough that even I am doing well in my online course."
3,Comprehensive and Extensive,"I opted for the Kindle version as I need to travel with my textbooks. In this regard, the Kindle version is an excellent resource for searching, highlighting and portability of course. The content of the book is extensive and will certainly become a reference book for future efforts beyond academics (after finishing my MBA). The information is presented in an easy to understand format, understandably ""easy"" is a relative term. However for the amount of information required on this subject this book is very thorough. It provides numerous case studies, references to real-world examples and plenty of chapter review questions."
2,Ordered New but was not new,I ordered Quantitative Analysis thinking it was new since it was listed as new. It was a used book that was like new and was even listed as new on the receipt. Luckily it had the CD that I needed with the book which was the whole reason why I bought this book new or thought I was buying the book new. The used books were $50 cheaper than the new.
2,Very Satisfied,Book arrived within a few days. Very satisfied with the experience (let's hope I can say the same thing about the class ;-)
2,Not as described,The book did have the CD but was heavly highlighted and answers marked. The seller stated no highlighting or markings. Do do recommend this seller
4,Quantitative Analysis for Management,"This is a good book, but needs to focus more on how to plug in the numbers to Excel or the provided QM program."
2,"Good book, bad quality press","This review is merely to comment on the printing quality of my book. My book looks like someone took the original, and photocopied it in black and white, and then bound it with a glossy cover. Based on the tables in the chapters and break out text boxes, there used to be light coloring or shading. This is not the case in the text book I bought, which has grainy/fuzzy tables that are in shades of black or white, or grey. Overall, I'm not super impressed with the publishing quality based on the price I paid for the book, since it was new.I've never have issues with Amazon before, but I'm disappointed with what I got this time."
2,Disappointment - Students Beware,Ordered this book from Amazon as new - and did not receive the software. I discovered on day 1 of class that the QM Software is required for class and now I am scrambling and will probably have to buy a legit copy of the book from my college book store at a ridiculous price of almost $300.
2,"Book looks great, but where is the DISK?!?!?!","I ordered the book and it was in pristine condition. However, there is no disk with the book that my school requires.... With this being a new book, the supplemental material should be within the packaging...."
5,A cold-warrior winner tells,"I read this book translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil.This book is an almost auto-biography of an american and cold warior, the general Vernon A. Walters.This general, who died some years ago, tells many chapters not only from his life, but of World's history.There's even some chapters about the author's life in Brazil.The cold war is over and Soviet Union is so over as Roman Empire, but the lessons of how to win a battle to World's control are alive in this book."
3,"Talented, confused","I wanted very much to believe the Stephen King blurb on the front cover, and for the first 100 pages or so I found _The Straw Men_ to live up to its billing. Initially I found it stylish, smart and creepy-- exactly the feeling you want to have from this sort of read.Unfortunately, Marshall wasn't able to tie it all together at the end in a way that's at all satsisfying (at least not satisfying for me). In order to get the explanation he needs to end the book it felt as though he really had to torture the plot. I got confused initially, and finally ended up annoyed.Enough promise to read more by the same author, but this book isn't all that it could have been."
5,New book out!- Sequel!,"I see there's a new paperback out, featuring Ward Hopkins, which I assume is a sequel. Due out 3/30/04. The Upright Man, Michael Marshall. I can't wait to get my hands on it!"
2,Lee Childs and Steven King create a psychological thriller,"I really liked the idea of this book, and it is much better written than the average, so much that I think it leans more toward Stephen King than Lee Childs. However, like a Jack Reacher novel from Lee Childs, it's a mild mystery with a lot of action and exploration of interesting circumstances. The plot itself becomes apparent after the first third of the book, at which point it detours from X-Files/Stephen King supernatural scariness into the more literal fiction of Lee Childs, where a social phenomena is made into a tangible, shadowy, micro-conspiracy that then needs destruction by brave heroes. Like many books, the last third is where the author loses his nerve and gets too linear in his writing and also too vague, as he tries to massage together loose ends. I really enjoyed the first half of this book, but found the conspiracy of an overdone archetype, and finished reading without any real sense of mystery."
2,A Most Unusual Tale,"This is a good debut novel by the writer and will satisfy the reader if one is willing to overlook certain issues that were noticed by this reader. The character development leaves much to be deired as the featured members in this novel seem to lack depth. The story is a good one with the writer crafting three stories that seem to be divergent into one as this story develops. Unfortunately, the stories do not converge into a solid story until one has completed nearly one fourth of this book and makes for a somewhat confusing and tedious read. The story finally does take off into a good read for the second and third quarter of the work. When the writer brings everything together in the last fourth of the work, the reader is left with a story that is so unrealistic that it detracts from the earlier writing that has been done. The book is fair and this writer shows some positive flashes, yet nothing really special."
4,Great Book!,"I picked up this book as an advance copy at the store I work at, and I could not put it down. I felt that the story was very well thought out, though it couldve used more description, it was a well written book. It is slightly reminiscent of early Dean Koontz works. Based on that, I have personally sold about 25 copies of this book in the 2 months it has been out, and have not had a complaint yet."
3,Great concept,"Great concept, well put together and explores some interesting issues. But, unfortunately, I have to say it is certainly not on a par with his previous novels: Only Forward, Spares, One of Us and, if you like scary stuff, his book of short stories: What You Make It. I almost get the impression it was written with the intention to get it on to the big screen. (I am sure it'll make a great movie).We still love you Mikey."
3,Keep Up the Humour Michael Marshall,"It is rare that you find a passage in any book depicting a funeral service and burial that causes one to howl with laughter. However, Michael Marshall pulled this feat off so smoothly with a sprinkling of cynical and hilarious lines that reflected the thoughts of surviving Ward Hopkins as he endured the service. I was reduced to the state of being in stitches during the death of one of the major character's parents. Of all things! Yet I felt not a twinge of shame.Pretty masterful stuff and an indication that Michael Marshall has not completed his journey of seeking his rightful place in literary best-sellership. However, he has far to go. The Straw Men was definitely a good read but it was marred hopelessly by overstated righteous indignation on the parts of the good guys. Sadly, the Straw Men finally dies on its own sword -- the author's excessive proselytizing about the decayed state of today's world. Snore!"
4,straw men,Great book and I got it on time. I have now read two of the series and waiting for the 3rd installment. I like this author alot.
2,STRUGGLED TO EVEN FINISH,This book flips between two different storylines which appear to be completely unrelated. These dragged out way too long. Eventually they intertwine but I felt the connection to be too contrived and implausible. Just never connected to the story and honestly glad when it ended.
1,Gratuitous,"I'm a lover of good writing and good thrillers in particular. This book is well written, however I found it sickening in its relish for brutal, evil violence, particularly to young children. Especially if you are a parent I strongly consider giving this book a miss. I bought it on the basis of exceptional reviews. I was not, however, prepared to read its content and have since removed it from my library."
2,Thinks it's more clever than it really is,"I read this book because Stephen King called it a ""masterpiece"". I soon came to realize that Mr. King probably read something else, or his brief review was taken way out of context. The author has tremendous potential as a writer, and he uses language in interesting ways, but he's no storyteller. This book is three times longer than it should be because long passages of useless gibberish fill the page rather than advancing the story. And the finale is disappointing. Moreover, I'm not sure he knows anything about cops, or CIA, or lawyers.This book could have been a raucous good read, but it wants a good editing, first. Mr. Marshall is about two books and a good editor away from becoming a an excellent writer."
1,"Nice cover; slow-moving, overly detailed story","Like a few other people here, I bought this book for its cover -- not very smart, but I was curious. (Stephen King's blurb on the cover didn't make any impression on me -- I mean, come on, hasn't he blurbed even John Saul?) The book started out intriguingly but lost its way quickly amidst too much descriptive prose, making it a chore to finish reading it. While there were flashes of humor I liked, they just weren't enough to save the story. Not a keeper."
1,Tom Cruise will play the lead....,"I think this book was written in a weekend. I'm serious, it's that bad.It starts off just fine, with several seemingly disconnected and shocking events that you assume will be tied together later on. And they are, but when you finish the book, you'll still be scratching your head. The ending just doesn't make sense, neither do any of the character's motivations.The characters are hard enough to keep track of, because besides being stiff and pale representations of real people, they keep being referred to differently by the author. First he's talking in third person, then he's back to first person. It's disconcerting, hard to read, and I can't believe that this book was published without being hacked into a million pieces by an editor. Or perhaps it was.Like another reviewer here, I finished the book, but wish I hadn't."
1,Boring waste of time,"Silly plotline, irratic and smartass style, confusing character definition. I couldn't stay with it, couldn't get into it, didn't care about the characters, the story, or anything. I kept wanting and waiting for something cool to happen because Stephen King said this was a ""masterpiece."" Junk is what it is."
1,WHY DID MICHAEL MARSHALL DO US THIS WAY?,"Like many other readers I tried to believe that Stephen King Blurb about how scary as $%#% this book was. This was the absolute worst book that I have ever read! I will go on to say that this book got on my nerves. I got to page 221 and deceided that I would not take anymore of this and I just gave up! Please Mr Marshall ""DON'T WRITE ANYMORE BOOKS LIKE THIS"""
4,Decent from start to finish,The book is a smooth read. Somewhat predictable but good character development and a ending that welcomes a sequel that has just been released. Defiantly a must have book for the beach or camping trip. I give it a 7.5 out of 10.
4,Quite Good,"This is a thriller that will repay handsomely if read. The basis for the story has enough truth to it to merit a suspension of disbelief. There are an ample supply of red herrings to distract the reader, each of which is plausible. The pacing is a little choppy and the dual points of view (first person and third person omniscient) do not blend as well as they ought.On the other hand, the bad guys are very, very bad and the good guys are believable, and largely sympathetic."
5,Not much has changed,"Read this book and then reflect on what is happening in Iraq and Afghanistan. Look for similarities in policy at the highest levels and at the execution of this policy in the streets and villages of these countries. I read this book in the late 1960s as I worked on a paper. I have to admit I didn't revisit it until I read of the death of Captain Lederer. It would be worth a reprint. I encourage all international affairs specialists to devote an evening to reading this book, it isn't too long, and then reflect hard and long over what is said in the book and what is going on in the world now. I think this is the best of Lederer's writings and I highly recommend it."
3,oliver's Wars,Oliver's Wars was a pretty good book it was no Harry Potter but I enjoyed it. I would have liked to know how Oliver's dad was and how Gus's dad was. I also didn't understand why they had to move to Halifax because Oliver's dad was in the Gulf War. In the begining of the book Jerry was all tough and cool like oliver's grandpa and in the end it was oliver and his grandma who were tough and cool. When I saw Oliver's Wars I thought it would be a bad book cause all of are other Novel Study books haven't been the best but I was really surprised with the out come of the book. I would give it three and a half stars but you can't use a fraction of a number. Oliver's Wars was a pretty good book.
4,About Oliver's Wars,"Oliver is a twelve year old boy who lives a normal life, until his dad who is a nurse has to go to Sudi Arabia for the war to take care of the people when they get hurt. Oliver's mom lost her job and they have to go to live in Halifax with their grandparents. Everything bad is happening to Oliver and everything that is bothering him is locked up and he dosen't know how to tell anyone. Oliver's grandpa is a major groutch and the school bully is after him. Olivers gym teacher dosen't know how much Oliver tries to be the best player he could be and is better at other things that the teacher dosen't see.If I were you I would read this book its a fantastic book and it shows how Oliver feels."
4,Olver's Wars,I liked the book Oliver's Wars because it was very interesting. I didn't like the part when Oliver and the bully from school Gus were talking because it is so sad when Gus tells Oliver that his mom left. Other wise it was great. I also think it was a good book because I understood it. In some parts of the book it was very sad. But it ended up to be a relly good book.
3,"Eh, I've seen better","Nothing spectacular, this could have been a book on tape. They just keep showing the same clips over and over again. The facts are a bit shaky, don't count on this as your soul source for CIA ops."
3,great,for anyone who is doing a English degree this is a great book full of information that is required for study many thanks for quick delivery
3,Colonialist's Portrait,"This book is a description of Calcutta from the point of view of a British colonialist. It begins with the history of the city, noting how it was officials from the East Indies Company who selected the site of the city and developed it from wilderness. Later chapters fill out the description of the city by taking up various topics in turn. These topics include economics, population, colonial buildings and institutions, development since independence, and 1960s local politics.Overall, the text is somewhat informative, though the prose can be rather dull. Moorhouse does a decent job at juxtaposing historic details with his own personal experiences in Calcutta. However, from his descriptions, he comes across as a British colonialist lamenting the direction the world has taken since granting independence to the colonies. To the extent that his observations about life in Calcutta are valid at all, they are clearly primarily shaped by his background and point of view."
5,A classic example of the greatness of Stevie Wonder,"This album features great tracks like ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"" which includes a magnificent harmonica solo, ""Creepin"" which is a slow but smooth song, ""You Haven't Done Nothin'"" which is a fast and lively song, and ""Bird of Beauty"" which has a beautiful melody and a great chorus."
4,"Stevie's soul-searching sojourn,","Not one of Stevie's greatest during his so-called classic years, but definitely one with tracks that can stand the test of time. We were spoiled by the greatness of Songs in the Key of Life and Innervisions, but this is not one to scoff at. Satisfying ... as Stevie, once again, takes us through another musical journey with his personal feelings and commentaries on religion, politics, love and some other things that may fall in-between. He doesn't always have to reach levels as high as SITKOL or Innervisions, but I'm still glad that he made this album."
5,Maybe his best.,"I bought ""Talking Book"" a few months ago, and it got me on a Stevie Wonder binge. This, by far, is my favorite of his 70s years. Its a combination of funk, soul, and balladry. He bounces back and forth between so many styles! ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"", ""They Won't Go"", ""Smile Please"", ""Creeping"", and ""Heaven Is A Zillion Light Years Away"" are absolute masterpieces. A great, great singer, writer, and composer. He stands alongside the Beatles as maybe the best. The best thing I can say is this album just makes me very, very happy."
5,"Another brilliant album by the ""Wonder""ful Master!",This album is unbelivable. I got it two weeks ago and cannot stop listening to it. Stevie Wonder never ceases to amaze me with his talent.
5,Fulfillingness First Finale,Another master class from stevie. his song writing and production is unmistakeable. A living genious
5,Great tasting preserves,The packaging is unique and keeps the preserves in pristine condition. I will most definately buy again.
5,Best blackberry jam in the world!,"I really love this jam. Not too sweet or sticky. Just perfect texture, deep color and true blackberry taste. How do they do it? I look for blackberry preserves all over in my travels but none match this product. Nice big reusable jar although I would like the option of getting smaller jars as I used to when it was in the local grocery store. I hope this product outlives me because I can't live without it!"
5,A powerful denouncement of war,Borovik's book is an extremely powerful denouncement of war - the meaningless act that destroys human lives and forever scars the souls of those who survive it. Forget about special effects movies and read some real literature if you want to know what 20-year old boyz go thru in the hell of war.
2,A Really Hidden War,This is the first I've read of Mr. Borovik and I hope he's a better journalist than book writer. I was anticipating some insight into the war but was instead given endless descriptions of faces and places that told me nothing of the war. Where I hoped for new information about the country and the people I got an enormous amount of how the author felt. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they were desperate to read something about war in Afghanistan and can't find anything else. Pretty boring read overall.
3,Barracks Stories,"Is what this book's main feature is. That, and interviews with three Soviet deserters. Most of the highlights (soldier killed 3 times, cheating wives, going back home) are the same kind of things soldiers trade over chow. The only military application you could get out of it is: Always bring sappers. The complaints of corruption, brown noses advancing over hard workers, unclear mission and directives, are in every army that has ever been. Overall, it did not live up to the hype, but I did learn allot of slang off it."
2,Just watch the Infomercial,I bought these for my father and he was really excited to watch them. Heck I was excited to watch them. I had always seen the infomercial trying to sell the Dean Martin roasts and it was hilarious. Let me save you some money. Just watch the infomercial when it comes on and enjoy some laughs there. They take the best of the best from each of these various episodes of the show and show it on the infomercial. The rest of these DVD's contain quite a bit of some seriously unfunny people. And even the ones who are funny you've already seen the best of them. Your call.
2,Roast,"I thought it sounded perfect for my brother, I dont know if I just read it wrong but I thought it was the Roast of Dean martin, but its not, He's just the host."
4,a teapot in a tempest,"a family saga told in parallel histories of the early 19th and the mid to late 20th centuries, spanning six generations. historic boston makes for a prominent backdrop for an elaborately plotted metropolitan treasure hunt doomed by a fatal curse. contrivances aside, an entertaining, nearly folkloric tale."
3,Great history of the Back bay,"I like this author, his historical perspective and research makes for good reading. The plot is exciting. I also really enjoyed his book ""Cape Cod""."
3,"If you like historical fiction, it's a good read","A good mix of real history with ""fictional"" history. The characters are likeable and the history is pretty acurate. An enjoyable read at the beach or on the train."
4,gripping...couldn't put it down!,"I am not always much of a reader, but this book caught me from the first pages. It is a MUST for anyone who knows and/or loves the city of Boston and the history that goes along with it. I found myself visualizing the streets and areas of Boston as I read each chapter. My only disappointment was the ending...I could not believe that I was on the last page! I wanted it to end differently for the characters (thus, only 4 stars), but overall I was quite satisfied with the book. I am now going to dig into Cape Cod, but the same author."
3,"Ok, but disappointing ending","I am a Historian so I thought that this book would be an interesting read. All in all this was a good book. I liked the way Mr. Martin would weave the past with what is going on in the future. It was an intriguing story and for the most part I really enjoyed the book. The problem was the ending. Without giving too much detail, the ending of this book was disappointing. After all the build up, it seemed as though Mr. Martin did not know what to do with the ending. I was left with this sense of, ""I read this whole book for that?"" feeling. I am willing to give this author another shot. He is a good writer and he does a good job of weaving history throughout his books. I just hope my second read does not end the way the first one did."
3,Disappointing End,"I love reading books about places I know well, likeBoston, especially history. And there were interestingcharacters, too. But the ending was just too awful andpointless. It will take me a while to decide if I wantto read more of his books, even the ones set in Boston.Despite the great local history, I just can't recommendthis one."
2,"Confusing story, weak ending and sloppy plot","Other reviewers have mentioned the weak ending - and I agree. Before the ending, there is also very sloppy plotting - two 'bad-guys' who have been killed at an apartment in Cambridge turn up a few chapters later digging a hole in a basement! While the weaving of the plot through Boston's history is clever, and is the best part of the story, the motivations of the main characters in the present day are not clear, and there are jumps in the story that don't make sense. It is OK as a Beach Read, so long as you can suspend disbelief and ignore the errors and inconsistencies in the story structure.The same writer's 'Harvard Yard' is a much better book, but also has a weak and disappointing ending."
2,Black Claw & Country Fever-Albert Lee,"I have always admired Albert Lee's playing, so I decided to try this collection of early recordings. Not quite what I expected. The playing is there, but the songs leave me wanting something else. I think I should have tried something a little later in his career, as he seems to be finding the right venue for his talents. Not a bad collection, but I'm sure he has dome better work."
2,Run of the Mills,"Wait a second.This small collection of Mills Bros. tracks was issued by MCA, owner of the masters? Geez. Is it really possible that all they could do for the first three songs here (only the best of the 10, BTW) is dub them from pop and tick-infested LPs?Oy.There's better out there. For example, check out the sound bites of ""Paper Doll,"" ""Lazy River"" and ""You Always Hurt (etc.)"" on this MCA disc:THE BEST OF THE DECCA YEARS. Light filtering = zero surface noise."
1,Finished with this band,When drowning pool first came out I thought that they were a cool band. Bodies and tear away man those were some heavy tracks from the band. Sinner was my favorite albums from the band. When dave died I thought that drowning pool was done beacuse no one can replace dave. But when they picked up a new lead singer things started to look up for them. Steap up was a cool song and I thought that this album was going to be as good as sinner. But I was wrong. The vocals are terrible. I ask myself why would they put this guy as vocals. I was dissapointed that I got this cd. Now they got another lead singer. What are they trying to pull a van halen. I'm done with this band. If you want to hear a good D.P. album get sinner. But stay away from this trash R.I.P. Dave
1,lost their sound and lead singer,nothin like old drowning pool. I was very dissapointed when i heard it. They should get a different name because this is not the drowning pool we have come to enjoy.R.I.P.Dave
1,Garbage,"How many bands out there sound like this, uuuh over 90% of them I would say, some of you might not agree but this style of music is so been there done that. It makes me sick that all these bands do is rush out garbage like this theres nothing catchy about it, I listened to the whole thing and it sounds like one whole continues song,every song on it just runs together, nothing sticks out to me."
3,not as good as sinner,R.I.P. DAVE WILLIAMS ever since dave died dp has been trying to get a new singer his name jason gong jones the first single on this album was step up good song indeed but love and war is better a cd worth your money but dont get this cd if there is another one you want get it first or buy um both at the same time
3,Lost it's touch,"After reading the reviews givin' already for this album, I have to agree... Drowning Pool is no long 'Drowning Pool'. They turned soft, something I hate... but, can't really blame them as Dave, the soul of Drowning Pool, died. Without his haunting screams in the music, it's just not the same. I have to give props for them making a 'decent' comeback in soft metal after one of there own passeed on. If you like headbangin, screaming-till-your-throat-bleeds kind-of metal, this is NOT for you. Good luck to Drowning Pool."
1,Step up step up what does that mean,This disc if awful that's all i can say anyway ive got to go eat some hay by the bay where ill mold some clay and i just mayhave a good day If you like the artist's below then youll love drowning pool and there musicCannibal corpseashley simpsonLil jonCherThe fat lady from the fact's of lifeMetallica( after and justice for all)Episode 2 of american idol..you know the one where they show all the retarded singersthat's all.. ive got to go to the mall where i stand tall and then ill buy a ball im sorry ill stop now wow this is funny like a black bunny i think ill slurp on some honey then ill earn some money man this review is funny hahahahahahaha
1,It's Official!,It's Official!! Jason Jones has just ruined DP's Career. DaveWilliams Died and they replaced him with this idiot who can't sing worth a (...)!!!! Don't Get This!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(...)
5,"Dave may have died, but this band sure didnt","Ok, as u know this is not Dave Williams. THe new singer is great though. Drowning Pool are back and stronger than before. The song Step Up is a Catchy, fun aong that any metal fan like me can appricate. Everything on this dosc is superb. SO IF UR GUNA BASH THIS BAND BECAUSE THEY SOUND DIFFERENT WHY DONT U TRY THIS CD OUT FIRST! Oh by the way, that 1 review that said Jason should die like Dave has a lot of nerve. Go buy this and give it a try. U wont be disapointed!"
5,++++++ stars this cd ROCKS!,"when i heard the first single off of the punisher soundtrack i was like holy sh-t these guys are back in a big way the punisher song was censored but this one is not on the cd. this cd from start to finish grabs you buy the throat and doesn't let go until you sing or shout all of the choruses to each song i haven't stopped listing o the cd it is awesome. the new singer sounds like the old man they are so similar but the new singer is awesome i don't know what he's doing in the studio to make his voice sound so powerful but he has a strong a-- voice. all i got to say is pick up this album and crank it loud and proud and YOU TO WILL BE be singing ""WHAT WHO WHERE WERE YOU? WHEN I WAS DOWN ON MY LUCK YOU KNOW YOU NEVER GAVE A FU-K!"
5,Very Surprised,I heard the song 'step up' on scuzz and it took a few listens to like itThe album is excellent and each song is better than step upExcellent the great drowning pool is back to its best
1,Pantera rip off ?,"Nu-metal that wants to rip-off pantera ? Are you sirious ? If this guy was a fan of pantera he shouln'd try to get in a nu-metal band in the first place--that his first mistake...second, rippin off a band is another terrible and stupid mistake.Why do it ?Get your own sound, man!Sinner sucked and dave may he rest in piece didn't do a good job neither.Anyways, drowning pool should all drawn and die like the late singer and retire---don't bother."
3,Not the Same,is sad the first lead singer died he was great but in the 2nd album there go a new lead but like the title says is not the same and I only like the song he did for the ending of the punisher ending credits.
2,I Miss Dave Williams...Drowning Pool Just Isn't The Same,"I just got Drowning Pool's debut CD ""Sinner"" for Christmas, and this is a kick ass CD. However, ""Desensitized"" tends to be disappointing. Without Dave Williams, Drowning Pool just isn't the same. ""Step Up"", the first single, is really mediocre. ""Love and War"" is also an O.K. track, but it just isn't no ""Tear Away"". This is a giant slide downward for the band..."
3,somewhat ok i guess,"and no im not gonna sit here and lament over the loss of dave williams-this is the new DP and so i review it as such.jason gong jones has a very limited vocal range, and it painfully shows on ""desensitized"".""think"" is a good opening track, and ""step up"" is a foot stomping, pick me up song.the album drags throughout until ""hate"" really smashes you in the face at the end.much much weaker album than ""sinner"", and if you are checking out these guys for the first time, try their debut cd."
4,Drowning Pool-On Top Once Again!!!!!!,"When i first heard about Dave Williams dying,I thought it was the end of Drowning Pool..How wrong that proved to be.They recruited singer Jason Jones and picked up fresh where they had left off.Showing the world that the heaviest musicians come from texas.""Desensitized"" is a record of straight laced,in your face heavy metal...Packed full of songs about aggression(""Step up""),organized religion(""Hate"") and keeping faith,when faced with tragedy(""Love and War"").However the best track on ""Desensitized"" is a song called ""Cast Me Aside"",about a bad relationship experience..If you like Pantera or are trying something new...This record is worth a listen.It is probably one of the best new metal albums of 2004!!!!"
5,Renegade's wrong,sinner was an amazing album renegade and dave had an amazing talent . it really sucks he died but this album is good to. step up kicks @$$
1,R.I.P Drowning Pool,"This band is now dead in terms of their music. DP's hold hit ""Bodies"" is a creepy dark song with a lot of thrash. The new song ""Step Up"" sounds like crap you would hear at a monster truck show. Drowning Pool has lost their heavy touch and has achieved a redneck sound"
1,It's a comedy album,"Ok, the video for Step Up is a joke right? Please tell me that it is because I am really embarrased for them. How they get to be on Headbanger's Ball is beyond me. This is not metal and never will be (and neither was Sinner). I hated Dave's DP and now I really despise whoever the new guy is. Oh, and I read one reviewer say that you should buy the Sinner CD because it went platinum. Guess what kid, Justin Timberlake and Beyonce are also platinum, and just because they are, doesn't make them good."
1,Who is this joker!,"This new singer is an absolute tool! I can't believe that the band went this route. Theyre going for some hip image of money and bitches. I don't get it. This is an absolute joke. This is not real music, come on!"
3,I beleve the pool is drained!!,"1st off the reason Dave was such a great singer was his stage presence. I seen him once at Ozzfest and he got the entire crowd crazed, Girls taking their tops off the entire mass of loyal ozzfestians leaping into the air and pumping their fists in synch with him!! His voice was great live, Not the best of course but sounded better then most! So perhaps you should re think your strategy before you put down a great man as he was!Now onto Desensitized, I give them props for returning after such a loss,As many bands choose not to(Ie:Alice in Chains) andA couple of the songs are fun to listen to, But over all the depth and creative thinking of drowning pool seems to be draning away. They play their instruments well, But thats all! These guys just need to pull it together and spend a lil more time on plotting out songs! I don't want to just hear the rythym I want to feel the rythym!"
3,i believe they suffered the sophomore slump....,"but its still a decent cd. i dont like the new singer that much but it still sounds like drowning pool. i like about half the cd and the rest i can do without. i saw drowning pool 2 days before the singer died and im really glad i went because it was a good show. i wasnt a fan of drowning pool but i have heard there songs on the radio at the time. i wish they wouldve just ditched the drowning pool name and came up with a new one because no new singer could replace dave. love and war is the best song on the cd, lyrically and musically. i cant wait to see them at the disturbed benefit concert, maybe there performance will change my mind about this cd but for it remains 3 stars."
4,After Dave,Drowning Pool is back after loseing Dave. I was unsure what to expect from there sophmore album With Jason Jones takeing up the vocals. Dave was a phenomenal singer he song with emotion like none other. I bought the album the day it came out expecting the album to be a tribute to Daves passing and it was to some degree but I also feel the same vibe comeing from there music as it did with Dave. Drowning Pool has done a great job minus the circumstances of losing dave. The music takes a slightly differnt path however I belive Drowning Pool would have taken this path with or with out Dave. There latest album Desensitized with Jason Jones has a few more lad back songs than Sinner did but they are still amazing. The whole Album Rocks and any fan of there originaly album should check it out or any fan of the genre.
4,To Hell...,"Drowning Pool is a signifacantly talented band, and with the raw power, emotion, and excellent orchestration of this album representing them, I think there should be a bit more appreciation towards these artists work. Especially considering how hard it must have been for the band to resume after the death of their lead singer. There is much alot of thought and feeling behind this album, but I suppose your average jerk off, like the ones posting these other comments, just don't realize that. May I suggest we all have a little respect for other peoples work."
5,Drowning Pool Maybe Better With New Singer.......,"Drowing Pool's first album Sinner was good, I think the new album Desensitized, is much better then the previous...Gong Jones kicks ass...I really cannot find one song that I don't like...I'm very impressed with the power of the music, and there wide range talents, of mixing melodic structure, with heavy sound....Great album, suggest anyone that like hard sounding music to purchase......"
1,Just Not The Same,"Drowning Pool just isn't good anymore. Dave Williams can never be replaced. He was and is still the man who Drowning Pool was all about. He was a kind man and way better singer than the new one. Dave should be in the Rock and Roll hall of fame. He is a legend. In dave's words ""The Things I Believe In Family, Friends, and Music, They Haven't Let Me Down Yet!"" RIP Dave Williams February 29,1972 - August 14, 2002 You are truly missed!"
2,Should have re-named the band...,"Dave Williams died much too young--go buy ""Sinner"" if you don't have it and don't bother with this new version of Drowning Pool."
4,AWE-STRUCK,"I read about the return of DROWNING POOL in a music magazine... I questioned it at first, not sure of how, or what it would sound like. Then I came to CDNOW, and the new cd was out... so, I went to the store to puchase it. I was AWE-STRUCK! I couldn't believe what I was hearing, like MR. WILLIAMS was the voice on the cd. It was insane. MR. ""GONG"" JONES brings the raw-intesity of DROWNING POOL before the unfortunate tragedy of MR. WILLIAMS, and I belive will take them to the level of recognition they deserve to see. I think it's safe to say that DROWNING POOL are back, and I personally hope that MR. WILLIAMS is up there somewhere, with ears open, and likes what' going on."
4,New singer does good; but its still the same music (mostly,"I got this album the day it was released, b/c its been 3 years since these Texans released an album, and 'Sinner' was a winner (no rhyme intended). Anyway, the new vocalist (RIP Dave) does a really good job. He cant sing as well as Dave, but he can yell and grunt just as good. You can tell the studio pro-tooled his voice to make it better- yet it still works. But the music is still very good (if you liked the first album) and its solid nu-metal. Recommended!PS- This album's a bit less spiritual then the first."
3,better than sinner,people are bashing this cd just because of the new singer they must have not listened to the cd cause its awesome as long as they keep putting out music like this there gonna stick around1)think-4/52)step up-3/53)numb-4/54)this life-5/55)nothingness-5/56)bringing me down-4/57)love and war-10/5 (best song on here)8)forget-5/59)cast me aside-4/510)killin me-5/511)hate-5/5pick this up now54/55
4,Drowning Pool is back,"People are saying that they are worse then before, that is just not true, even Dave Williams was a great person and a great frontman, Gong did a great job on this cd, and the rest of the band is the same. If you liked sinner, give this cd a chance you will like it"
1,This is to the singer of drowning pool......YOU DRINK WE WE,heeheheheheheheheWhy dosent drowning pool just drown themselves in a pool get it cause they stink like a portapotte on a hot summer's day heheheheheheheheheheheahahahahahahahahaha
5,Amazing,"This CD is absolutely amazing. I saw these guys Sunday night on the Headbanger's Ball Tour and they kicked major a$$. I rushed out today to buy the CD and it is just as intense as the live performance was. GO BUY THIS CD, YOU WONT REGRET IT."
5,Evocative Vocals,"Hollie Smith's vocal presence on this album is emotionally stirring. As a fan of Celtic music and culture, I find the vocals and arrangements to be dynamic and at times viceral. It is hard to believe that such a young woman can be so talented and accomplished. I would highly recommend ""Light from a Distant Shore."" I look forward to more..."
4,Reader review,"I just finished reading The Formula for Happiness, and wanted to thank the authors for presenting a very easy-to-read, practical manual for learning about what makes us happy and how we can become happier by taking very simple steps toward that goal.I'm a 62 year old grandma who is always looking for ways to help my grandkids grow up healthier, happier and more successful. I will insure that all my grandchildren read this book and believe that if they use the formula presented, they will be much better prepared to handle the choices they must make along the way to be happier and more sensible adults."
4,very good first cd,"The disc contains some very excellent material and through his lyrics one can really get to realize the time and thought put into this effort. Clay's voice and the music are very good, with his Oklahoma roots showing through. Clay puts forth a great rendition of Robert Earl Keen's ""Dreadful Selfish Crime"", and ""The House Song"" with Guy Clark is priceless. This CD is a great start and one which folks who appreciate efforts like Robert Earl, Reckless Kelly, and others, should own. I saw him in Oklahoma City solo and he was very, very good. He played some material from an upcoming CD, one that I will be purchasing."
4,Good and easy,Clay's music has spirit and a reality about it. He played for me and about 15 friends at a casual dinner in Nashville and he is as real on the CD as in person. You will enjoy this one.
5,The Book Made A Believer Out of Me,"The author takes you on a trip through history in a way you've never imagined - opening new doors with new interpretations and making the reader speculate as to the paternity of a mulatto man named West Ford. Was this man the son of George Washington? After reading this fascinating book I can say, YES HE WAS!I Cannot Tell a Lie is a deeply affecting story and I found myself moved by the plight of this courageous family as they struggled through two centuries to maintain their secret legacy throughout American history's most insensitive times.The characters are vivid and their story will haunt you for weeks after you've turned the last page. I can't wait for a movie to be made."
2,NO!,The best place to be ONE with this is in a clearance bin and you are desperate to spend a buck because you need to break a twenty.If you like unthrilling and easy to forget- this is right up your alley.Pass on it you will thank me.
3,Earthway 2050P,"I was not completely satisfied with this spreader.The claim was 80 # of fertilizer ,no way-no how will you fit 80# in the bin.The claim was the pneumatic tires would roll over the roughest lawn, again noway-no how."
2,Basically a scotts speader with big tires.,"Definately disappointed, basically a scotts spreader you get at HomeDepot for $40 with big tires. Does not throw seed or fertiler any better than my old $40 one. Sending it back."
1,disappointed,I have owned 4Earthway Spreaders in the past 25 years and have always been happy with them. My favorite was the large model with large tires. This one's leaver cord broke the 5th time I used it. I would like to order another large one but I think the company should give me some kind of credit. I'm sure every product has a lemon or two.s
5,Estate Poly Hopper,"I am very pleased with my purchase. It will help me with my 28,000 square foot front yard.Thanks again Harry B."
3,Good buy,"This is the best spreader I have ever purchased but also the most expensive. The pneumatic tires make the difference. All my other spreaders would come to a dead stop at every lump or bump with chance for spillage. I didn't have a problem with this one and the fertilizer comes out evenly where I don't have to move the gauge to 0 at the corners or when I made my turns. The fertilizer didn't get stuck at the bottom like other spreaders I have used in the past. I also liked the fact there was nothing to assemble, just took it out of the box and it was ready to go."
4,Earthway 80# Walk Behind Broadcast Spreader,"The pneumatic tires on this spreader make it possible to go over rougher ground more evenly. If you're tall, the handles could be a bit longer."
5,broadcast spreader,"Works great. Easy to use, spreads evenly and covers a large area in a short amount of time. Bought this to replace using a commercial spreader I had to wait my turn to borrow."
3,GOOD BUT ...,"First of all, I could use this well-built spreader right after took it from the box and found that it was a fine spreader. and those huge tires took me anywhere, any terrain in my yard. i am satisfied but believe that someone must change the product detail about its capacity of 80 lbs to 25 or 30 lbs. after poured a 25 lbs grass seed bag in the hopper, that was it. it was full. Although its performance was 5 stars, i give only 3 stars for the false description of this well made spreader."
3,Earthway Estate 80-Pound Walk-Behind Spreader,Not as well built as I had hoped. I don't believe the plastic wheel hubs and gear box were built for long term durability for large (2+ acres) uneven yards.
2,Not Happy,"4/6/2012 I received the spreader with the control handle knob poking out of the box and missing a part. I called up Earthway and they no questions asked are sending me a whole new control knob. I have to replace it but their cust. service person was very nice. When assembled i felt that it was cheaply made esp. for the $100 that was spent on it. The handle is way too short and makes maneuvering and using the spreader much more difficult. Lastly. don't use any type of powdery type product such as Lime because the agitator is much too small to feed the broadcaster. Pelleted lime and grass was good but again that handle needs to be longer, anyone over 5'7"" is going to find this spreader cumbersome to use."
3,Great spreader but with one weak spot,"This is a great spreader but it has one weak spot, there is a cable from the control assembly that opens the shutoff plate. This cable tends to bind and bend and now you have to open the plate by hand or fix the cable. The cable doesn't appear to be for sale separately, you have to buy the entire control assembly, or you might try to find some bailing wire at Home Depot that will work. Next time I'm spending a bit more and getting one with a rod instead of a cable, such asEarthway 2150 Commercial 50-Pound Walk-Behind Broadcast Spreaderor theEarthway 2170 Commercial 100-Pound Broadcast Push Spreader"
2,Earth way broadcast spreader,"I will preface my review by stating that I am new to gardening and this was my first broadcast spreader purchase.Pros: the all terrain tires makes this easy to roll about.Cons: I agree with a previous review that stated that the directions on how much product to use are very vague and I spent a lot of time doing all these calculations to figure out at what setting to put it on.You can't put more than 20 pounds of product in a time or else it won't spread. You have to turn the open and shut valve a couple of times and shake the whole thing and hope that it begins to spread. A once it spreads it works fine, but it seems to get jammed pretty often. I am very disappointed, especially given its price tag. I would not recommend this purchase."
1,Cheaply constructed Impeller,"I bought this Spreader hoping upgrade from the standard Scott's speader. I used it once in the spring and then went to use it in September and the wheels would turn. Upon further investigation I noticed that the Impeller warped and was hitting the body of spreader preventing the wheels from turning. I bent the impeller, which was very easy to do because the plastic is not rigid, and was able to use the speader, albeit, I'm not sure how accurate it was.I called Earthway and they sent me a new Impeller without any hassle. But it's made the same way as the orignial one, filmsy soft plastic, which I'm sure will warp. Very disapponting."
5,Great Broadcast Spreader for Homeowners,I purchased this broadcast spreader to replace a drop spreader that was worn out. I am able to treat my lawn in 1/3 of the time it took with the old spreader. The tires had good traction on my lawn. The chemical spread evenly. I would definately recommend this spreader to other homeowners.
4,Nice glass,I didn't realize that they make these glasses without the silver trim as well. This one does not have the silver trim. I was a little disappointed with that but it is nice to have the glass as a backup.
5,Pyle was an ordinary man who wrote abou ordinary men at war.,"Ernie Pyle was the perfect writer for the task of covering World War II from the perspective of the common man. His roots in rural Indiana coupled with his desire to see the world and tell the stories of ordinary people engaged in extraordinary endeavors such as combat helped him establish a style that has no equal. I found this book in a used bookstore in Palo Alto, Calif., and once I began reading I couldn't stop. His words are a tribute to a generation that truly did save the world. If you ever see one for sale, grad it. It's a real gem."
5,Find out what World War II was like for the average Joe!,It was so refreshing to read about the trials and tribulations of the average American soldier from someone who was there and was a part of the War. So often today our view of World War II is clouded by revisionist historians or political correctness. Ernie Pyle shows us what many of our parents went through in those years and in so doing helps us to understand them that much better. Thank you Ernie!
1,fluval impellar cover for 303,"I ordered the fluval impellar cover for a 303 pump, they sent the wrong part twice. THey have an inventory labeling problem, as the impellar cover is numbered with the wrong part number. Anyway, in spite of numerous calls, I never did recieve the part and spent 2 weeks waiting for nothing. Don't order from this company."
1,Never Got The Part,"They sent the wrong part and when I called them they said I ordered the wrong part they sent, even though I had the correct part listed on their invoice to me!!! They were called three times and I even gave them the information, stock # and description on their own invoice but never got what I ordered . STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"
3,A good book but could have been more comprehensive,"A very good book that explains all you need to know about the insignia used by the British Army during the Second World War. The plates in the centre of the book are pretty good although I felt they did little to really illustrate the main point of the work.There is an entire section devoted to the Armoured and Infantry divisions of the British Army illustrating what their division flash was, if they had one, and also giving a quick description of where the division served. The book however omits commandos, airborne and Indian divisions stating there was simply not enough room to cover them all, however this is a small book one feels they could have adequately been covered in the same book."
2,Not the best Nordhoff and Hall,"I had fond memories of the book and of the movie itself I had seen many years ago on TV. In viewing it again, I wonder what I was thinking then for now it is more than a bit boring and its atmosphere of 1930s feel-good socialism is almost unbearable now that we have lived through the prosperity of the 1980s.On top of that, the VHS sound is exceptionally poor.Moral: If a film is NOT available on DVD, it is probably that unpopular for a good reason."
4,need to go back to decca,"It is a good album It is more folk orientated than previous albums Simple melodies ,catchy phrasing and less hard rock driven than Mckendree Spring 3 The only shortcoming is the publishing rights are owned by a german recording company named Line .It makes it more difficult to obtain their material.I wish they were under Decca.Then their music would be more accessable to consumers"
2,"yea, if it doesn't shake...","Great deal; two monitors, headset mounting & stands, multiple vid inputs, headphones for each monitors, and other pluses...but it can't seem to take the vibrations of a moving vehicle. I've set it on seats, on absorbing pillows...it's ridicules how much it skips. But at home on a table top, it's outstanding. Hell, you gotta wonder why it's listed as ""currently not available"", and I can't seem to find it listed on Audiovox's website."
5,"Excellent study of ""The Burnt-Over District"" of upstate NY.","New York State's construction of the Erie Canal transformed the tiny frontier town of Rochester into young America's first inland boom town, with an economy based on milling local grain and transporting the flour east to feed the older coastal cities. In this role, it became the prototype for all the thousands of commercial towns and cities that sprang up along railroads across the Midwest during the nineteenth century, as well as the crucible in which the Midwest's particular brand of evangelical protestant piety was first worked out. 'A Shopkeeper's Millenium' is by far the best examination of this important piece of American history I have found anywhere, and I recommend it highly."
3,"Fine read, evidence not convincing enough.","I read this book in conjunction with another about antebellum religious reform in the 19th century. I found this book easier to understand, but that's not saying much. It was still not fully clear what Johnson was trying to say, although his writing abilities are pretty good for a historian.His work examines the city of Rochester, New York leading up to the reform of Charles Finney. However the assumptions he makes by examining only one area are not convincing enough to be applied to the entire reform efforts in New England at the time."
5,"Wow, it's been that long??","I bought this LP at age 16, was mesmerized by it then, and now at age 53, to hear it again mesmerizes me and stuns me to think this is what I was listening to 37 years ago???!!! [Ok, Motown was there, too, but this is some heavy s*** for a 16-year old!] Sure miss this guy [as well as Gary McFarland] and his tight/melodic arrangements. You really need to check him and Jimmy Smith out on several of Jimmy's classics from that era, as well. [sniff]"
5,Vic Ruggiero Rules!!!,"If you enjoy roots reggae, great lyrics, ska and a kick arse band these guys are for you. Probably their best album to date even though they all rule. Vic is far and away one of the best singer/songwriter of this generation. The guy cannot write a bad song. Everyone I have exposed these guys too becomes instantly hooked!"
5,Top Deserted Island Disc,"Regardless of what genre of music you're most into, The Slacker's The Question is among the best albums of any genre. The Slackers play with an authentic Jamaican ska sound. Ska/rocksteady/reggae such as this by The Slackers is great music. It's got soul, heart, a groove, harmonies, unique melodies, it's usually catchy as hell and it isn't meant to be commercialized! It's meant to be enjoyed and DANCED to!Anyway if you've heard of the Slackers you probably already know how awesome they are. I would recommend this cd to anyone who is looking to find out what ska is all about, this is the cd I would give them. It's got 19 outstanding tracks that are sure you keep you dancin' on that deserted island."
2,"Emerald age, my eye !","While this biography of a fine, mysterious player is adequate, Casway's assertion that 19th Century baseball was an ""Emerald Age,"" due to Irish dominance is ludicrous. Almost all the top ball players were of English ancestry at the time, which reflected the U.S. immigrant population. With the exclusion of Negroes, Latins etc. Irish did stand out as a ""colorful"" minority."
5,Excellent,Fits perfectly on the Boar Staff. Great protection for the spear head against damage and from cutting yourself until you're ready to use it.
2,Not what I expected.,The color displayed was different from what was delivered. In fact none of the colors are what I was expecting to get.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $,"This book was simply a waste of money-awful. The requirements to qualify for the scholarships is too incredibly specific. It is also the worst organized book i have ever read. It took so long to comb through the whole book only to find nothing. Please, I beg of you to buy a diffrent book. Don't waste your money."
2,Too specific,"I'm a junior and didn't really find this book of much use. There aren't a lot of general scholarships. There's a lot of scholarships relating to specific schools or organizations. There weren't a lot of scholarships for essays, for juniors, or just an average person."
1,Doesn't last,"Let's start with the bad things:1: There's no way this battery will ever give 2 weeks of standby time in the real world. When I first got it, about 7 months ago, it would give 5-6 days. Not bad, but a far cry from the ""1-2 weeks"" that was promised.2: It decays fast. 7 months ago I could get 5-6 days of standby time. This battery has now been reduced to being 1-2 days. The ""zero memory effect"" claim is also worthless.Personally, I'd avoid the SCH-3500 at all costs. While it seems like it should be a decent phone, it has a myriad of problems. I'm currently on my second, the first one died after less than a year of very light use. Pick a different phone and battery system."
4,Tobacco Warehouse Beatles,"What is it about musicians from the south of the United States and Anglophilia? Power-pop bands came from Cleveland too but the best ones were from the South: Big Star and the dB's. Both were great in the studio and lousy live. I saw the dB's a few times after Chris Stamey left and they never were any good. Peter Holsapple always sweated too much. Now he lives in New Orleans and has a band, the New Cowsills. Stamey runs a studio in the former Soviet Union. Will Rigby plays drums for Celine Dion. Gene Holder is the second guitarist for Phish. Original vinyl copies of their first two albums go for as much as [$$$] each on eBay."
2,Meh...,"A girlfriend I had years back bought this album for me because she loved the song amplifier and figured I would as well. I thought the song was stupid... and told her as much. We broke up a couple months later.The first three songs on the collection are good. The first, Black and White, is an absolute gem. If I had a seven inch of the first three songs I'd give the DBs a four star rating. This... I don't find it interesting. Sounds like an 80's movie background band. Not worth the $10.Maybe you disagree."
1,Nice guys but...,"I bought this album on the strength of these reviews-what a mistake. After listening to this comp, I am again truly amazed at the reviews. I understnad that one persons floor is anothers ceiling and all that, but hey... these guys are nowhere even near Bigstar or other bands that I see other reviewers use as a comparrison. Anyway, as a heartfelt sign of the times or nostalgia for people who saw/ know them, maybe this album is great, but for a lot of us who did indeed never hear of them (no surprise there) their music doesn't really stand up to the test of time. Dated? You bet! Musicianship? Basic at best. Coming from someone who likes listening to anyone who puts it on the line- no matter how wavering, I gotta say, if this is their best example, these guys were amateur warblers who came to NYC to just hang out and take in the sites and music scenes."
4,"Finally, I Own the dB's","I remember looking for the dB's back in the early 80's and only striking out. This previously unavailable in the US set of discs were on my to buy list for quite a while. I believe the wait was worth it. I like the Holsapple tunes the best, but Stamey's contributions add a nice quirkiness to the set.I hear the band was terrible live. Well, I saw Stamey solo a couple of months ago and he was terrible live. I like his new solo disc, though."
3,Mediocre read,"This is the first book I've read by Margaret Truman and I had high hopes. The book did not live up to those hopes. I found the book easy to put down and forget, the plot and characters didn't hold my interest and....kiss of death....the ending didn't make my heart race or send even a single chill down my spine. When I read a good book, I tend to get lost in that book - I forget that I'm READING a book. I never got that feeling with this book. I was always just reading.Maybe I've come to expect too much since devouring Michael Connelly, Nelson DeMille and David Baldacci.The best I can say is that it wasn't a totally boring read, just mediocre."
3,About time!,"Finally, a pretty good read from Truman. Granted, many of the flaws are still there: dangling loose ends, MK-ULTRA psychobabble, naive heroine, poorly inserted exposition...but the plot has enough twists and turns that you can gloss over them, and the characters were written better this time. This would actually make a pretty decent cloak-and-dagger movie."
3,"Good stuff, but the other books are better","Like all of her books, this one has wonderful recipes, but some of them seem recycled from her other books. There is also kind of a dated feel about the book, like it came out in the early 80s or something. However, if you want to just skip the main course and make desert, this book's for you."
3,Seemed ok,"For the money, this set was probably a good deal. I can't believe I will use them all but it's nice to have them around when you need them. As was the case with a prior reviewer, my box was a little bit jumbled (but not a complete mess).I was looking for some 1 inch snap rings for a heavy piece of equipment. These snap rings are pretty thin (even the bigger ones) so I ended up using two of the 1 inch snap rings to replace the single worn out snap ring on the equipment (which was more heavy duty).I will probably end up looking for some more solid rings for that particular application but these worked in a pinch."
1,Snap rings and a mess.,"I ordered these and when I received them, opened the box to a mess. They weren't in plastic bags and as a result the rings are scattered all over the little bin divided areas. It's going to take me days to straighten the mess out. I may just chuck the mess and order another brand and hope for the best...NOT RECOMMENDED!"
5,Exactly what I wanted...,"I needed assorted SAE snap-rings for my machine shop and these were the right price so I ordered them on a thursday night and recieved them the following monday morning. They arrived just as the seller had described them, well packaged and delivered promptly. I am very happy with this purchase and would do business with Neiko Tools again in the future with no reservation."
5,Quality product,These are quality rings. Great for the handyman and the shade tree mechanic. It will save those unneeded trips to the hardware store to buy one or two at a time.
5,"Beautiful Voice, Wonderful CD",This is my first exposure to Diana Krall. She is a throwback to a better era when singers really had talent and music was a pleasure to close your eyes and listen to. A wonderfully melodic soloist. Superb!
5,One of my absolute favorites!,"I have never written an online review of anything, but when I saw the average for this one was less than five stars, I figured I should add my two cents. This is by far one of the best albums I have EVER heard and I play it all the time! It's extremely romantic, soothing and warm. Take some advice -- buy this and then just sit with someone you love and listen to it. It will be one of the best evenings of your life."
2,Diappointing,"This review comes from a big DK fan from Canada who loves her style and piano. This is easily her worst CD; no edge to her voice, which is muted for some reason, piano almost nonexistent, strings take long monotonous solos, questionable song selections for a a jazz singer. Even Cry Me A River doesn't make it whereas live in concert she does a a bang up job. Buy ""All For You"" or "" When I Look in Your Eyes"" to hear the real Diana. I hope that she doesn't make this kind of mistake again"
2,Yawn,"Diana Krall has almost no feeling on this CD. I like her piano playing, possibly she should do more of that. It seems almost like she is being put together by the record company, much like a pop artist. She might be better off fighting for some artistic integrity in the long run."
2,Love Scenes - I miss you...,"Because I loved previous releases of DK, I pre-ordered two of these CD to use one as a gift for somebody very special to me. However, this disk is a sad disappointment. Shortly speaking, it is over-produced, arrangements are annoying, sound quality is poor. 'Besame Mucho' is a disaster...She sings slow ballads, which I like best in her interpretation, but the feeling of intimacy is missing. After two years of silence this CD sounds like a joke from such a talented artist.It is no use to make further critical comments concerning this record - read others from those who describe themselves as her big fans and yet give it one or two stars only. Unfortunately, they are perfectly right.Sorry K., I didn't know..."
5,Diana Krall At Her Superb Best,"This CD is more than I could have imagined.Being the sentimentalist that I am, this CD touchedmy very soul. I can't say any of these cuts are betterthan the others. They're all so melancholy and smooth.When I listen to this CD, I sit in an easy chair, sipon a fine, dry, burgandy, and get lost. Most beautifulmusic!"
2,Saccharin singing with no depth,"As an owner of a few Diana Krall's CD, I have to say this CD is truly a waste of her talent. In this, she made it too obvious that she fell into the trap of commercialism and easy money. Where is jazz, passion, emotion, and depth??? No life in this album. This is one of those tacky labels with a famous name attached. Good for a cocktail/lounge music, at most."
2,Her piano must be broken,"I really, really wanted to love this album, because Diana Krall is just so talented. But alas, I must agree with the folks who feel that she has abandoned her strengths. I agree very much with the fella below who discusses the ""George-Bensonization"" of Diana Krall. Diana Krall is a ""musicians musician"", or at least she was...but not on this album. If you loved her other albums because of their intimate vocals and fabulous piano playing, you will be disappointed with this effort. You should probably still buy it, but don't expect her old magic. This is an album of sophisticated background music, albeit excellent background music. I have all her CDs and this is her poorest effort. If you like jazz at all, buy any of her other recordings first. On the other hand, if you LOVE Celine Dion or Streisand, buy this one first and work your way backwards. By the way if you like Diana Krall, check out Julie London, you'll like her too."
3,"Great singing, but where's the piano?","Diana is one of the top jazz piano players in the business today, but you wouldn't know it from this offering. Her singing is better than ever and these are excellent arrangements, but we don't get to hear much of her wonderful jazz piano artistry. From my perspective her piano work is more attractive than her singing, so I'm going with three stars. Maybe she'll do a real jazz album next time."
1,don't buy this one! Buy all her others!!,"I really love her other CD's, but was very, very disappointed when I first listened to this one.It reminds me of Mantovani in the sixties and seventies.You might use it as elevator-music though,"
3,elevator music with some swoon,"I am a Krall fan; what can I say? Granted, the background is a bit too Nelson-Riddle-ish and Ms. Krall is very tame in this one, but it fits an occasional need to tune out the world, turn down the lights, and enjoy the lush arrangements and the less strident parts of Krall's timbre. I liked it! One is enough, however; on to some more real Krall."
1,Keep the booklet and throw the CD,"Yep, the booklet is sooooo sexxxxxxxy.Well, so ? Musically, one of the worst jazz(y) CD of the year. Apart Lisa EKDAHL, hard to find a less swinging singer (?).Hard to decide who is the worst : Mrs KRALL or the sound engineer ? Take ""The Look Of Love"" track. Can anyone tell me if Mrs KRALL is playing acoustic or electric piano or ... accordion ? Can anyone explain me why this instrument crosses my room from the left to the right speaker ? Can anyone explain me how not to be distubered by the edit and drop out ?A pity Amazon don't allow people to rate a CD 0 star.Better keep away from this total failure."
1,What a let down!,"Diana Krall is a multi-talented performer. Wheather it's her beautifully seductive voice or her lively, syncopated play on the piano, this woman has it all. This latest disk unfortunately, does not. Diana has shifted her priorities over the years from emphasising her piano to developing her vocals. This may be great for those listeners atrracted primarily to her singing. If you're like myself however, and was hoping to hear her ""WOW"" you on the piano, you are going to be sorely dissapointed. Diana Krall the piano player failed to show up for these recordings."
3,somewhat of a letdown,"Don't get me wrong, this cd is okay, but if you are a fan of Diana's piano expertise you won't find it on this album. It is heavily buried under the lush orchestration. Also if you like the occasional upbeat tune, you won't find that either. This is the type of music that would be great to play softly in the background and have a conversation over. It has its place, but it is not a cd that merits playing again and again. Every song has the same ""torchy"" quality, which is fine, but the whole cd? The Look of Love is a great cut and Diana does a good job on S'Wonderful, I Remember You, and Cry me a River, but it needs the more up tempo song thrown in and less orchestration and more of Diana on piano."
3,"Good Album, but flawed","This is a wonderful album of jazz pop standards with flawless execution and Diana Krall's wonderful voice and distinct time signatures. Trouble is: the strings.The strings add to the lush sound, but if you mentally remove them and reduce these arrangements to just the other instrument's voices, you get a better album and songs that could be executed in the smoky club of your scotch blurred memories where you fell in love with jazz in the first place. Sure they went to the expense of sweetening the sound with the strings, and probably increased market share in the process, but it turned an excellent album into a good album.Jazz has had too many tragedies to add to the pile."
5,nostalgia here I come,"This reminded me of my first love, a long time ago, and we never had a real goodbye. I sent it to her. Great songs, great arrangements, great voice. It doesn't get much better then this!"
2,From a Grammy Winner to This?,"I am a fan of Diana Krall and have several of her CD's. and I too am disappointed in this album. I must have counted a 100 disappointed reviews in here-- really depressing. Then I discovered Dena DeRose! If you haven't listened to Dena, you will be in for great listening Jazz experiencence. Dena really is a unique talent with a clear, exciting voice, an accomplished jazzz pianist, she arranges, and composes for her albums, accompanies herself and her solos are of a jazz intellect that are melodic and exciting and smooth.I listen to her albums constantly, and never tire of them, because with each listening, I feel something new. Although Dena is relatively unknown as DK, I think she will be a contender of Diana's. I certainly was not disappointed with Dena DeRose. Win me back Diana, with your next album."
3,Some Nice Music,"Very nice instrumental on every track, but Diana's vocal range is limited and it shows on various cuts.Overall a fair effort, pretty bland actually, with one cut in particular a real stinker.""Besame Mucho"" is by far the worst song on the album, absolutely terrible. Dear Diana, stick to your Canadian English, please!"
3,The look of love,"I became a Krall fan from the time I heard Love Scenes. I then bought all the CDs she had made. I am very disappointed in the Look of Love with the large orchestral backing. Mrs Krall performs best with a small jazz group; there is an intimacy which I find enthralling and her piano playing ability is more evident. The orchestra is a disturbing intrusion, completely destroying the intimacy of previous discs. I hope she will return to the jazz group format. I was not impressed by the quality of this recording."
4,Good but not her best,"I have two of her other albums and have to admit this is the lesser of the three. Having said that, I've listened to the CD 8 times in a row today and I'm not even close to getting tired of it. I do wish there were a couple of up tempo, fun songs on it but it is still a very good CD. If you like mellow, clean music you won't be disappointed by this album."
2,Disappointed,We've all waited a long time - and for what ?Music quality is not good - orchestra with vocal is very difficult to have them both on the same cd track.Maybe next time Diana.....
5,S'Wonderful - S'Marvelous,"From the opening strains of the LA session orchestra, this album is S'Wonderful. Diana continues to improve with each and every recording; and, with her music already 5-star, that is quite unbelievable. The recording itself is very crisp and clear (listen for the triangle on ""I Remember You""). The addition of orchestral accompaniment only adds to her sultry, smoooooth voice and piano playing. She has added Latin flavor with ""Besame Mucho"" and I can't imagine who could say 'no' to such a simply elegant song. The album closes with ""Maybe You'll Be There"" and my answer is there is no 'maybe' about it. Yes, yes, yes. This album is not only S'Wonderful, S'Marvelous!!!"
3,"Agreed, Diana has turned into a Muzak singer","I listened to Diana Krall from the beginning, her ""Stepping Out"" album accompanied by Ray Brown et al was excellent, making her one of my favorite Jazz singers.I don't know if it was her first album being so hard to beat or herself trying to appeal to a wider audience, after ""Stepping out"" it was all down hill from there. She gradually turned from pure Jazz to this album, which is pure elevator muzak. Reminds me of Harry Connick Jr.The Look of Love is okay as a pop album, but it has no soul. Dusty Springfield was all pop but her version of the song ""The Look of Love"" had soul, and Diana did not even come close on that one.Overall, I think she could do much better than that. I wish she could goes back to her root and start playing jazz again. I doubt if she would do that though as this album would attact a lot of new fans thinking this is Jazz."
1,What are they thinking?,"I am a big fan of Diana Krall but found this album to be a big disappointment. The arrangements are very plain and the whole album lacks energy. If you want to hear how a ballad can be delivered with intensity and direction, try Kurt Elling's latest - ""Flirting With Twilight"" I'm looking forward to Diana's next effort."
2,"I Don't Understand Her Career, Although She Has Good Taste.","I don't get Diana Krall. Yes, her taste in music is excellent, and the accompaniments to her singing are usually good (as they are on this album). But she is such a lousy singer, with a voice that is almost always flat and stilted. She always sounds like she just rolled out of bed at 7:00 in the morning and dragged herself in front of a small jazz group or a big orchestra. All of these songs have been done a million times by real singers, so what's the point of listening to her?"
2,Krall=Medicore,"Her voice defines medicore. SUltriness to cover the fact that the voice is weak. Her grammy was a laugh, but then again most of them are."
2,Pompous,"The magic from the previous records are gone... replaced by a big set of strings. Diana Krall still has a great a voice, but she sounds like one of many pretty-but-boring singers, drowned in a boring, predictable sound. There's not much trace of jazz here, which was made her previous records good - it's just a predictable, slightly pompous record. Go buy ""Love Scenes"" or ""Stepping Out"" instead - they're brilliant, and showcase what Diana Krall is good for."
2,Disappointed,I think this CD is just OK. Adding string orchestra made her voice more distance. Intimacy is the key of her other album. It's totally lost here. Her singing is bland. Gone are the 'conviction' and playfulness. Her selection of songs are weak. There is no new ground broken here. I won't recommend this album.
5,Good Mood Music,"I bought this album because it has the same mood all the way through. I can put in on with a bottle of wine in the hot tub and totally relax and not get stressed because every other track is of a different tempo. It is all the same. This music ""is intended to paint a romantic scene, candle lit dinners, a walk along a moonlit beach, quiet nights"" as stated before. ""There's no difference in the way she sings Cry Me A River, Besame Mucho, S'Wonderful, or Maybe You'll Be There"". And that's exactly why I love this album and Diana Krall. If you don't like a bottle of wine in the hot tub and a painted romantic scene and quiet times and good music then go get ""Guns & Roses"" stuff."
5,What can I say...... Diana Krall has the old era magic,"As a jazz fan for many years with most of my heros being from the 40s and 50s, I can say that Diana Krall would compete with the best of them. Head and shoulders above most of the new talent entering the jazz arena today. I say that even though I want to like them, because I want that era of music to continue. Diana just has that old style magic. This CD is just no exception. You cannot go wrong with any of her CDs if you like the play list."
2,Don't judge a book (or a CD) by its cover,"I purchase quite a number of CDs thru ... based on the recommendation feature. It's probably my favorite ... feature, and it has introduced me to a broad assortment of great music.I've been familiar with Diana's name -- not her music -- so I took a chance when this CD kept popping up on my recommendation list. I'm honest enough to admit that I was somewhat captivated by the cover photo.Unfortunately, the cover photo is about as good as this CD gets. I really didn't grasp from the other reviews that Diana Krull is a female Frank Sinatra. Yes, she's apparently a musician as well, but that really didn't come thru to me based on this effort. As I listen to this I just keep thinking, ""lounge singer, lounge singer, lounge singer.""I'll keep this CD in my car for a week or so and see if it grows on me, but I don't see a lot of promise."
3,Album is OK,"Diana Krall is a good singer although I think she is over rated. This album is ok but it can be better. The only track that I really liked on this one was The Look of Love... but Sergio Mendez' 60s version was probably still better. Don't get me wrong, she's good but I think Christy Baron is better..... but, I'd still recommend you buy this one."
3,Good Album - Great Tunes,"This is a solid album of really great, popular numbers. Diana can certainly be thanked for bringing jazz vocalists back in the spotlight. She is a very competent musician and singer. While she is not my favorite, she has certainly done a great service to the genre by bringing it to the commercial forefront."
2,Elevator Music,"It was nice when the handlers allowed Diana Krall to be a jazz musician. Her piano playing was excellent, her vocal timbre and timing were divine. This CD is great if you like elevator music. The strings wash over and bleach out the music. For good jazz from Krall go back to her earliest efforts."
2,"okay, but not great","I am a big Krall fan, but this album lacked that special touch she has had on past albums. A little bit to much orchestra, and not enough piano. An okay album, but not great."
5,Oh so wonderful!,I love every song on this CD. It is Diana Krall at her best. I recommend this to anyone who has all her previous music. She gets better with each CD.
1,Major disappointment from Krall,"I bought this CD sight unseen (or unheard) because I loved her previous two disks (would have given them 5 stars). What a disappointment! I could probably live with the cloying strings in the background if Krall's performance was up to her previous ones, but she seems completely detached from the songs she's singing. There's no emotional connection, no snap, it's like she's sleepwalking though the performance. These are songs that tell a story, but Krall is singing words like they have no meaning. Let's face it, Krall doesn't have a great voice, she depends on her wit, and phrasing to connect with the song. They're absent here, and what's left isn't enough to justify buying this CD."
1,awful!what awaste of talent.,I have been a fan for some years but I had to find someone to give this wretched CD to{who wouldt be offended{.The production swamps the players in a sea of sugar.It could be Mantavoni for slow learners.I will still go to see her live...as long as she leaves the string section at home.
2,Decepcionante.,"Este disco está muy por debajo de los anteriores. Aunque estéticamente se acerca a ""When I look in yor eyes"", los arreglos orquestales de Claus Ogerman son muy inferiores a los que Johny Mandel hizo para el disco anterior, y además apagan el maravilloso piano de la Krall. La versión de ""Bésame mucho"" en espanol es un desastre... El acento inglés y la falta de entonación lo hacen muy inferior, por ejemplo, al que no hace mucho realizó Diane Reeves. Sugerencia para el próximo trabajo: olvidar los arreglos de cuerda, y volver al trío o el cuarteto."
5,A perfect musical instrument...,"I could have listened on... or played forever with this voice and sound. Yet I took time out to tell music., I must play with this exquisite phenomena. Yes, thats what I'm doing Ms Krall. Totally appreciating your gift, and thankful that there is more. ..."
1,She has great legs....,"OK, I admit it. I bought the album for its cover. For insomniacs this is great therapy. Diana almost seems bored on these tracks, and the highlights come from the accompanying orchestration. Because of other reviews, I am going to buy some of her earlier works & give it a listen. If she was not a looker, would you buy this cd?"
1,From a woman,"It is sitting in my cd rack but it was not my idea to buy this album. I do not understand why artists that cannot come out with their own songs have such a great success. At least, if she would have done those songs in a diffent style than the original songs, it would be a little more interesting and creative. Imagine a country version of ""The look of love"", or the opposite, a jazz version of ""Sweet dreams are made of this"".I find women have a lack of imagination in music. Singing is the big thing for them and that's about it. When they touch an instrument, they don't want to reinvent music and limit themselves in few styles. Sexy and good looking is another big thing that I would trade easily for woman with charisma. Would they venture to be part of a band instead of being the sole member?Stupid as it is, I have a pair of shoes that I call my Diana Krall's shoes, as if she was nothing else than a pair of legs on top of high heels.(...)"
1,what's the fuss about?,"I followed the hype and bought it. Big mistake. Hellooooo there! Not only is it painfully academic, it's also plain boring. If you're into lounge look on Lisa Ekdahl's side. If you love jazz just listen to Kurt Elling. When HE does a ballad album there's more than meets the ear..."
3,Not up to par,"I really enjoyed all of Diana Krall's previous CD's. Own them all. So it was with great anticipation, I bought this CD. But it is simply not her best. Every song on the CD is slow, slow, slow. They are just alike, one after the other. The CD just drags. ""Besame Mucho"" and ""Cry Me a River"" are the best songs on the CD. They are also probably the peppiest songs on the CD. I love a torchy ballad and Diana's sultry voice is perfect for them. But here, they go from slower to slowest. Don't play this CD while driving, you'll fall asleep at the wheel. Diana's CDs are fun to listen to. Not this time. Try again, Diana."
1,"pluck the strings ,trash the photos","The latest offering from a very telented singer/pianist.voice very good but this production has two major problems(1)a very slow dreary orchestra which makes musak sound positively swinging(2)tacky,revolting sexist accompanying photos.Don't buy it.Instead get her earlier work,or anything by Stacey Kent or Carmen McRae."
2,Almost Julie London,"Diana Krall has a lovely voice and nice songs, but not up to her usual standards. It reminds me of Julie London, but with less force and energy. The album is too weak in interpretation and misses musical guts."
2,IT ISN'T HER BEST.,"I think in this album Diana tried to win you over with the pictures rather then the music. I felt her songs lacked emotion.She had more pictures then songs. It is no doubt that Diana is a pretty woman but that isn't why I listen to her music. I love Jazz but this album was in a low bedroom whisper (as I have heard another reviewer say)and wasn't what I think she is capable of.Sex is what sells in pop but not in jazz, we want substance and emotion.I was disappointed."
2,Too slow for Bossa Nova,"These days when Bossa Nova is making quite a comeback, I don't really mind if old artists want to join in and fine tune their creative musings to the sound of sexy cool music.Unfortunately for Diana Krall, this does not look like one of her strengths. The orchestra dramatizes every song with sweeping intros and what-not whereas the heart of Bossa Nova is a Bongo and accompanied with classical guitar strings and the tempo is supposedly medium-slow as opposed to her downright slow and boring.In my old favourites like 'Besame Mucho' she sung like she did not take Spanish in one of her foreign language classes whereas in 'The Look of Love' like she has just lost love instead of found it.The thing here is slow, sweeping orchestration and a husky voice does not always equate sexy. I know she has talent but Diana needs to let it all come out and not 'try' that much."
2,I am disappointed,"Unfortunately, Ms. Krall's follow-up album to the phenomenal ""When I Look In Your Eyes"" is as disappointment. The song selection is unstimulating at best, boring and pathetic at worst. Even her voice seems out of sync, and her normally stunning intonations are all wrong. The title cut which is a great song, seems dull and unimaginative.It seems that her fame and noteriety has caught up with her artistic capabilities and dulled her creative possibilities. Why did Tommy LiPuma let this be released? An utterly boring and disappointing album from an artist on the verge of stardum. Again, the album cover focuses too much on her looks. Diana should be ashamed. This time her music does not equal her looks."
2,Where's the jazz?,"Ms. Krall's latest album consists of stylish renditions of standard tunes, consisting of ""mood music"" appropriate for rainy days and background music. Unfortunately, for those who remember her earlier albums or may have heard her perform, there is very little if any of her substantial jazz piano playing ability on display. Given the abundance of elevator music and/or ""smooth jazz"" offerings, it is regrettable that Ms. Krall does not have the courage, conviction, or perhaps opportunity to simply record a straight ahead, hard bop trio album (or a quartet with someone of note -- Joe Lovano?). Most likely, given the success of her last two albums, she has the means to choose her own artistic projects. Her tasty, well-constructed improvisations were such a welcome addition to the new jazz talent that made its brief debut in the early and mid 90s. Now they have taken an excellent piano player who is easy on the eyes and made her a fixture of yuppie love affairs."
2,Diana is Oveworked,"I am an avid Diana Krall fan. I have all of her discs (imports included) and have seen her in concert three times. As much as I think she's the greatest thing to happen to jazz vocals since Peggy Lee, I've got to let her know that this latest path in the road she's taken is not the one to stay on. She sounds tired and uninspired - which I'm sure she is knowing the demanding schedule she keeps. It's overproduced and each song is sung in the same key. I enjoy her singing on the holiday Target commercials more than this disc. Go back to your roots Diana, and don't let the demand for your fabulous music lower your standards to get it out there by any means necessary."
2,Sleepy,"Ms Krall has discovered the cure to insomnia. What happened to the Diana Krall of ""All for You""?"
3,Emotional Deadpan,"Diana Krall has a lovely voice, with a wonderfully rich tone quality and impeccable intonation. For all that, The Look of Love is a disappointment. The emotional range Krall expresses goes all the way from A to B--there's no difference in the way she sings Cry Me A River, Besame Mucho, S'Wonderful, or Maybe You'll Be There. It is all emotional deadpan, and the slick arrangements make her sound like Tony Bennett on Prozac after a sex change. As music to make out to, it's perfectly fine, but as a CD to listen to throughout, it's a disaster. It's not that I don't love ballads, but if there's no pain in the songs about loss, no ecstasy in the songs about love, the point is missed. This one is probably not worth owning, even if she does look lovely in the photos."
3,"Diana, not Julie",It's been done before. Julie London and Barney Kessel. Diana is very talented but she would be better off to develop her own unique style. Julie London hasn't been dead long enough for all of us to forget her.
2,A step down for a talented artist,"Great songs, beautifully lush arrangements, subtle rhythms...unfortunately, the singer seems to have phoned in her performance. Her delivery is, for the most part, flat and lifeless, without any of the spark she showed on previous albums. Maybe she's tired from touring too much, but there's no reason to try to sell a bad performance.If Ms. Krall has any respect for her fans, she'd have a cup of coffee and rerecord her vocal part for this CD."
3,Dissapointing Diana,"I have every Diana Krall CD and eagerly anticipated this release. Unfortunately, Ms. Krall didn't seem as enthusiastic to get back in the recording studio as this is a very lackluster effort which she seems to sleepwalk through. Nothing new,nothing different,nothing memorable on this CD. I'm on to Jane Monheit..."
2,Too Syrupy,I am a big fan of Diana Krall from her very first releases but I find the Look of Love release to be too syrupy. She is moving further away from her jazz roots. I would like to see her re-emerge with the traditional trio or quartet setting which allows her jazz style to shine. Back to basics would be my advice.
3,Good mood music,"THE LOOK OF LOVE is definitely one of Diana's better albums.But,I do agree with some of the previous reviews-her vocals don't have enough ""beef"" on this album.It does sound like she's half asleep on a few tracks.As far as the ongoing debate over whether she's a real jazz singer,I would say she's most definitely a jazz singer(you could hardly call this music ""pop"").Although from a personal point of view,I would probably say that Karen Carpenter is more of a jazz singer than Diana-even though Karen's repertoire is only about 25% jazz.While Karen's phrasing and vocal technique is similar to Sarah Vaughan or Nina Simone,Diana is more comparable to Astrud Gilberto."
2,"I don't get her, either","I gotta agree with the reviewer who said he/she doesn't ""get"" Diana Krall. I don't either. I've heard a couple of cuts on the jazz station and read enough good reviews to figure she was worth checking out. Maybe I got the wrong Diana Krall CD, because this one did nothing much for me. It's a nice collection of songs, I just wish someone else was singing them."
1,the look of love,"A travesty, and I like Krall quite a bit. Two tempos only, Jimmy Scott ballad and medium-slow bossa nova. Arrangements completely vanilla, no originality whatsoever, and feature an overly-present guitar on most of them. She just sings these great standards completely flat. No surprise that, considering her support. Her producer, arranger, manager and she herself should be sentenced to a 3-year diet of Percy Faith. Hey Klaus, she's Diana Krall, not Barbra Streisand! You should refund your fee to her so she can get the small group going again and really showcase her talents. To me, this album is a BIG disappointment."
5,The Look of Love,"I owned this CD for a few years then I losted. When I purchased it from Amazon it was in excellent condition. I received it in the time estimated, no problems."
1,A Journey Into Mediocrity,"OK, I took the plunge, bought into the hype, believed what I'd read and ordered this CD from Amazon. Hey, it doesn't hurt that she looks great on the cover either! Talk about the old addage ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"", don't judge this record by it's cover, or the reviews or the previous Grammy nominations. This is such middle of the road, unimaginative, watered down pap I can hardly believe it. Mediocrity really has risen to the top, a la Britney, J-Lo, etc. A pretty face and a pretty weak musical effort. If this type of music REALLY interests you I suggest looking elsewhere for your aural pleasure - Enya, Eva Cassidy, Marilyn Scott, Patricia Barber are all better places to spend your hard earned music dollar."
3,If I'd Wanted Julie London...,"I learned about Diana Krall of ""Sunday Morning"" and bought all her CDs because her piano and voice were a great combination. We have no piano jazz here. I loved Julie London in my youth, but I was expecting D.K."
4,Diana goes Romantic!,"Expectations are in the eye of the beholder!This fact is what must drive artists nuts. There are always purists around who will find fault with any deviation from norm. This is why one reads such widely varying critiques of Diana Kralls latest effort THE LOOK OF LOVE.Yes, it's true she uses strings in a decidely non-jazz tradition. Yes, she chooses material that is traditional pop rather than jazz. This upsets the purists among us. Tough!Here is what counts. Does she deliver the goods? Yes. Not perfectly, but very well. She is evocative, romantic and sexy. Not a bad set of qualities. This effort will put you ""in the mood"". Isn't that what an artist is supposed to do? We can quibble here and there with a selection or two but the project works and that's what counts. Give the lady a break. She is finding her groove and doing it well.Ignore the sniping and give it a listen. You will like it."
2,Not a Stretch,"I began collecting Diana Krall a few years ago because she was a shining example of a newfound jazz recording artist, blessed with a great voice and outstanding piano skills. And we'd get these showcased talents before a small trio or quartet of jazz musicians. But lately her artistry is buried playing love songs with an orchestra. If anyone is looking for watered down easy-listening stuff, go for it. But this is NOT jazz. I guess I'll have to catch her on the way down."
5,Great Music But Bad CD,"I was so excited to get this CD because it had just about every song that I really love of Diana Krall. Unfortunately, the CD would not play on my Bose music system. It would play on my computer with Windows Media but I could not RIP it to install it on my IPod. Amazon was terrific in assisting me to return it. The sender admitted that ""it would not play on all devices"" which I don't understand but now I am looking for another copy."
5,Diana Krall is in class by herself,Two weeks ago I had never heard of Diana Krall but read online how good a singer she was so I heard the sound clips from The Look of Love and instantly became a Diane Krall fan.After buying the CD and hearing the complete songs I liked the music even better. The song selection was superb and Cry Me A River was a perfect example of how vocals should be mixed with music as Diana Krall sang this perfectly and the music didn't overpower the vocals.Don't know when I have been more happy with a purchase of a CD. I have played it over and over and yet am not anywhere close to being tired of it. Diana Krall is in a class by herself when it comes to singing a song with emotion and her piano playing matches vocals very well....would recommend Look Of Love CD to anyone that loves soothing music.
3,in her style,"By the time of her previous album (""When I look in your eyes"") it was apparent that DK had found her style. Romantic, intimate, lounge atmosphere music with strings background ... which is nice if you are in the mood for a rest and relax. DK is strong enough to maintain your attention so her music doesn't fall into the background. Still, her style and records easily become constricting and too soothing. It doesn't challenge you. This album is not too far away to be called a sequel from her previous ones. I saw her recently in a concert, where the dress code was tie and jacket, and we sat nicely 'admiring' the music, clapped quietly. Playing live, DK had more fun and took chances, which was not visible in the record. I hope she takes more 'risk' in the next album.ps. under Tommy LiPuma production are we going to see a duet between DK and George Benson? Hmm.."
3,After Such A Long Wait....,"DISAPPOINTED and I blame Claus Ogerman's ""rich orchestration."" I am a huge fan of Krall and prefer her in a minimalist musical environment. The lush strings and orchestral accompaniments take away from what we have all come to love about Krall (just that, Krall!!). Also, the song selections seem a bit bland and without much life. I'll admit I was really looking for something a bit more energetic, playful, and humorous. Didn't find it here. Guess I'll have to stick with the old material `til next year."
3,Boring,"While Ms. Krall has a pleasant enough voice, her interpretations of classic jazz songs are flat and uninspiring. I listened to this cd once and felt nothing, then thought I'd give it another chance. Nothing. It's bland, soulless, white-bread music. More easy listening than jazz, really. Ms. Krall is definitely an attractive woman and I'm sure that will help sustain her career. Personally, I prefer my jazz with a lot more guts."
2,Asleep,"Will the real Diana Krall PLEASE WAKE UP. I have every CD that she has released and seen her live several times. She and her quartet have a hot tight sound. After waiting so long for a new release, this was indeed a disappointment!"
3,"Nice arrangements, but I still like ALL FOR YOU better","Aside from my title and rating, I won't say anything more about the music here. Plenty has been said by others already. I just want to point out, for those who may not know, that the ""collectible"" edition with 2 bonus tracks, which some sellers here are listing for more than $20, is really just a Target exclusive which you can buy at regular price at any Target store. (The bonus tracks are ""Charmed Life"" and ""The Man w/ the Bag,"" both currently heard in Target ads.)I just hate to think of some unsuspecting person getting burned. Be careful, don't pay ""collectible"" prices until the thing actually goes out of print."
4,Leave Besame Mucho to the Latin Singers,Overall I rate this a 4. Diana's voice is really heavenly but she should have left the spanish song home.
2,Uninspired Easy Listening,"Diana Krall is a talented vocalist, but her performance here is flat and uninspired. Even if her interpretation were more interesting, her particular style would not suit the song selection. And last but not least, what exactly is the point of covering signature songs by legendary artists such as Ella Fitzgerald & Billie Holiday? In my view, it is an insult to the memory of the artists in question, and to the intelligence of aficionados everywhere."
2,An Okay Album.....,"Alright, I wouldn't say that this album is bad because there is still nice tracks like ""S' Wonderful"", ""Cry Me A River"" and ""The Look of Love""... Ms Krall sounded nice in these tracks as she manages to bring out the right feeling....Other than that, I think this album is a disappointment... The rest of the tracks sounded quite boring. Ms Krall sounded tired and I couldn't really catch the melody....Buy this album is you are really crazy over Diana Krall...If you're not and wants to listen to this album anyway... Just borrow this disc from a friend if he/she has it...."
3,The Return of Mantovani,"There is really nothing distinctive about this disc. It has no edge, dynamics, or intrigue. The orchestrations are syrupy and remind my of my father's Mantovani. This disc will offend no-one, but is overproduced and as it reaches for sentiment, it lacks soul."
2,"Looks great, sounds dreadful","Diana Krall's best looking cover art to date wraps an excruciatingly dull CD. A huge disappointment after the brilliant performance delivered on ""When I Look In Your Eyes"".Maybe she needs to re-record all the songs here, with a jazz producer, not some reject who thinks the sound of Mantovani and Barry Manilow from their declining ""Las Vegas"" years is the 'future' of music.Diana needs to keep the great cover art... a little skin always sells, and Diana Krall sure has great looking skin. So the photographer can stay. But if the product is jazz, not pinups, then a big change in direction is needed, and the producer needs to be fired."
2,too orchestra heavy,"I've been a Diana Krall fan since Only trust your heart. I think this album is allright, but is very far from where Diana really shines: when she is playing and singing upbeat jazz with a small (drumless) trio. The addition of the orchestra somehow muddys things up. Bring back the days of Love Scenes!"
2,Boring,"Diana Krall's impeccable musicality can only take a listerner so far before ennui takes over. If there's a missing ingredient in her musical persona, it's passion. She's the aural equivalent of a quaalude. All of these standards are tastefully rendered, virtually pristine in a tapestry of lush arrangements. The unvarying emotional tone, however, virtually smacks of minimalism. It's as if Krall is afraid of exposing some awkward, inexplicably human feeling. For another set of standards, try Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now. Unlike Krall, her good taste doesn't freeze the material."
3,Nice packaging,"Nice packaging, lovely voice and songs, but not up to her usual standards. Maybe more effort went into the packaging than into the presentation?"
2,Boring and Pretentious.,"She has a great voice. It's time for her to start doing some music of her own, and not copy other great female voices anymore. I have never heard such a pretentious interpretation, singing as someone who has the most marvelous voice on Earth and trying to make it sound special. Not a bad CD, but just very boring and pretentious. You can almost see her singing: ""I'm the best, screw the rest !"". Very disappointing. Don't waste your money. Go for Vanessa Rubin instead (Female Talk)."
4,As Ever....,"I am not rational about Ms. Krall. I guess I would enjoy an allbum of her singing songs from Sesame Street, maybe even old TV commercial jingles, but as best as I can tell from my idolatrous haze this is a particularly good album. The songs are very good choices for her voice and her style. The execution soft and flawless."
1,What is all the fuss about this 'talent'? NO star rating,"If Diana Krall wasn't a tall, semi-attractive blonde, I doubt there would be any interest in her. She is like many contemporary 'jazz' performers whose voices and instruments are emotionless and flat. Please do us a favor and stop brutalizing the old standards and trying to moderize them - they are perfect they way they are. No one can match the REAL jazz performers like Ella, Louis Armstrong and Sarah Vaughn. Stop wasting your money on the likes of Diana Krall, and while I'm at it - Kenny G.Ick. There's no accounting for taste..."
2,The Look of Love - The Sound of Depression,"After seeing Diana Krall on a tv show and marvelling at her pianistic and improvisational abilities, I ordered this Album. Boy, what a mistake! Her undoubted talents are hardly evident in this collection of ""love"" songs which are almost all given wrist-slitting arrangements. If you enjoy ending up twice as depressed at the end of an album as you were beforehand, then this is for you. Otherwise, find something happier to listen to, like a funeral march."
4,She does it again,Diane Krall always surpasses the expectations of her work. She takes something old and makes it new again and even better!
3,"Strong, but a bit slow...","This follow-up to ""When I Look in Your Eyes"" has both its good and bad points. The vocal work is exceptional as usual - hearing Diana's sultry tones on the opening notes of ""S'Wonderful"" somehow makes all of the tension release. However the arrangements and heavy use of the orchestral background gets a little tired and slow. ""Love Letters,"" and ""Dancing in the Dark,"" are so slow-moving that they're nearly unendurable. Even though ""Besame Mucho"" is done with a slightly Latin beat, you really wish she had done it as a straight-up dance-able mambo. ""I Remember You,"" ""Cry Me a River,"" and ""The Look of Love,"" are certainly the high points of the album, but still on the a-bit-too-mellow side. I enjoy the album, but I'm still looking for a jumpier, jazzier tune (like ""Devil May Care"" on the previous album,) to kind of break up the flow."
3,"Good, but missing variety","I love DK and have all her records; I agree with most of the reviews regarding her wonderful voice and the sensuous orchestration. Two faults in this otherwise beautiful record:The lack of variety, and Christian McBride's near anonymity. This CD would pack more punch had one or two tracks out of ten been uptempo, big-band style numbers. McBride, one, if not *the* premier bassists around, is hardly noticeable (perhaps that's what he wanted?). For completists, get it. If you're just starting out with DK, get ""All for You."""
3,Something's missing. . .,"Supple and sexy voice, but where is the nuanced rhythm and arrangement in ""When I Look in Your Eyes""? This accompaniment is predictable and uninteresting in comparison. You should never buy the best first!"
3,"Per Wife, Diana has had much better albums.",I don't like being asked to write such a long answer for a very simple question. This should be optional and not a requirement.
2,Ummmm.......,"Yes, I can't help wondering about Diana Krall's success. To me this sounds too much like the Jazz equivalent of Celine Dion. Soulless and superficial. Then again, all music types seem to be heading towards a similar level of mediocrity aren't they? I don't think she's a very good singer; to me, she sounds like a poseur - like many others I suppose. I won't repeat what's already been said many times except that these songs have been done better by many others. Seek them out unless you're only interested in the cover."
3,Diana Krall is bad when she wants to be,"I could play 'S'Wonderful' and 'The Look of Love' all day, but the rest of the album... not really. If Diana Krall jammed like she does in those two songs in all her songs, I'd listen to them constantly, but as it is, there's only a couple that beg repeating. Another reviewer mentioned that she's ""souled-out"". Give her room to showcase her voice and she'll be good to go- girlfriend needs to sing it like she means it, not like how she's supposed to. When she doesn't do vocal stylistics, the magic isn't happening, so please! more of that."
2,not so good,"Her vocal phrasing is really uninspired on these clasically-arranged songs. She uses the same husky breathy singing on ALL of the tracks and it all sounds too much like the same song over and over again. Its a shame really, because these are great songs.Really, her vocal phrasing could only interesting if you haven't heard these songs ever before in your life."
1,"Sorry, but this album is a stinker...","I, like everyone else impatiently awaited the arrival of this new cd. What a letdown. I agree with other reviews that the conviction is not there, the vocals are bland, more pathetic if you ask me and all around it sounds like nothing more than a droll mess of elevator music. Take away her name and vocals and no one within a million miles would touch this sappy mess. For Pete's sake get rid of that orchestra! Yikes! It simply does not work this time, plain and simple. Even the record store where I go people were asking the manager to turn that thing off! How sad. I own all of her other cd's and this is by far her worst. Dress her up as a sex kitten and forget about what got her here. Now she's famous, so the powers that be are running the show, no matter what she says. This cd blows, I'm sorry I bought it, but for those of you who think Diana is god and can do no wrong, then this sap is for you."
3,Piano is missing,"This album is very similar to her last. Her singing is getting better, but there's no evidence that she's one of the top jazz pianists out there. It's a nice mellow album - great arrangements. I rate it a three because I was expecting to hear more ""jazz"" -- more of her brilliant musicianship. I guess its a money thing."
2,The look of Love,"I love Diana Krall, but this CD is just not that fun to listen to. It sounds like she is on cold medicine and makes me feel the same way. It is waaaaay too slow. Waaaay too little instrumental usage. But...I still love Diana and her singing, but please give us a bit more entertainment in a CD. The only time I listen to this one is if I need to go to sleep."
3,"Could have stretched, but didn't...","If you're a Diana Krall fan, you'll buy this CD. However, there's nothing in it that will surprise you. ...There's really nothing new here. If you were to slip this CD in with a few other of her prior CD's and randomize the playlist, you'd hardly notice these songs when they come up. Being buried under mounds of strings, her voice doesn't rise above the languid setting. Which is a shame, really, because she is such an incredible talent. I was anticipating the CD to contain a handful of highly polished gems, which can always be reliably found on each of her earlier recordings, but which are missing here.I don't suggest passing on this CD, but if you've been spending a lot of time with her earlier work, you won't see her showing any new sides on this one.Give it a spin - great sound, tremendous voice, nothing new.Big fan, but a bit bummed with this one."
3,where did Diana go?,"Her latest album continues her slide from her best album, All For You. She is becoming more of a commercial singer, and less of a jazz pianist with every album. As her popularity rises, with each album containing less and less piano, I'm sure she will lose most of her early jazz audience, who contributed to her early success. Bring back the piano!"
2,Didn't like it,"I love Diana Krall but have to say this was a let down. I'm sure the other reviewer have already given their comments so I'll spare you. For those new to Krall or deciding on which album to get, I recommend some of her earlier works. My personal favs are the All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio and Love Scenes albums."
2,Diana Moves Farther Yet from Her Strengths,"'Steppin Out' is by far my favorite Diana Krall album -- the vocals are not quite as polished as in later releases, but the piano work is superb and the song selections are mostly up-tempo. With each successive release she seems to be moving further from the strengths that make 'Steppin Out' such a success.On 'The Look of Love' Diana's vocals are out front -- not a bad thing, of course, but the piano work takes a backseat and appears mostly as single-note-at-a-time filigree. The orchestral arrangements are evocative of bad pop music from the 1960s and 70s. All of the songs would sound better in classic jazz trio format -- with a more prominent piano part, of course.In all, I found this work to be a big disappointment.I am going to one of Diana's concerts in December and hope to hear more of the early stuff. I'll take a 'Frim Fram Sauce' over any of her more recent recordings...."
3,Solid orchestration but less verve,"Orchestral strings largely displace the guitar strings, and sap a little of the bounce and originality from Diana Krall. Still, her vocals are thoughtful and where the piano gets a chance, it doesn't disappoint.I would certainly be curious about how much Ms. Krall contributed to the style of the arrangements and orchestration. In some ways, this reminds me of Billy Holiday with the orchestra. While Diana is left to improvise a little with vocals, the strings aren't all that interesting, and it seems like we lose a dimension.It's hard to find a guitar, piano, and great vocalist combo. Maybe she'll get back to that next time.Still, if you're a Diana Krall fan, you should buy it."
1,A Journey Into Mediocrity,"OK, I took the plunge, bought into the hype, believed what I'd read and ordered this CD from Amazon. Hey, it doesn't hurt that she looks great on the cover either! Talk about the old addage ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"", don't judge this record by it's cover, or the reviews or the previous Grammy nominations. This is such middle of the road, unimaginative, watered down pap I can hardly believe it. Mediocrity really has risen to the top, a la Britney, J-Lo, etc. A pretty face and a pretty weak musical effort."
3,"Solid, lovely, but not fresh","I just don't get the Diana Krall craze. Mind you, she does have a lovely, if somewhat monotonous voice, and it is well-suited to standards. What makes me crazy about this CD is how hackneyed the arrangements are. Every cut, though beautifully sung, is something you have heard before, many many times. With nothing fresh in her approach to the music if I have a choice between Diana's Cry Me a River and Dinah Washington's, there ain't no comparison. Go Dinah. It's not a bad disc, but I just don't think Ms. Krall is the savior of American jazz or standards singing her supporters have made her out to be."
5,A gorgeous and subtle album,"Don't believe the critics on this one--it is a stone gorgeousand tasteful album, may even be her best (and that's saying something given""Love Scenes"" and ""All For You"".) Those who callit jazz muzak or elevator music--get some ears. It may ormay not be ""pure jazz"" for purists, but it takes jazz back towhere it ought to be--in people's homes and lives. She isperhaps closest to a female Sinatra in this CD, which remindsme in some way of Sinatra's slower concept albums such as""In The Wee Small Hours"". The orchestration is beautiful, and, yes, there is plentyof jazz for those able to hear it. Sorry,critics, if you don't like her versions of ""Cry Me a River""and ""The Night We Called It a Day"", get the wax out of your earsand listen to what the woman is saying."
2,Finally realized that I&#65533;ve been taken for a ride,"I'm a Jazz lover who's always eager to learn more about it. The critically acclaimed previous albums of Diana's had made me wondering if it is my uneducated ears that's not finding her music as comparable (if any) to the likes of modern greats. For example, Shirley Horn. Well, so I bought all of them so I can get educated. However, after buying this one, I am now realizing that I (we) have been taken for a ride, and having more distrust of the reviews from these Jazz ""experts"" from reputable magazines and newspapers."
3,Not her roots,"Diana Krall is a supertalented singer and pianist. On this album she shows too less of both. I love her for these subtile piano solos she played on the albums ""Love Scenes"" and ""All for you"", which are reallllly great ! But this album is more likely to listen to on a snowy december day, with the cat on the oven. I miss the colours of her voice and solos. The gave me so much. In November she will be in Hamburg and i am very happy cause i will listen to a great musician of our time, back the her roots...The guitar sound is much warmer than every other guitarist i listened to, but his solos had been greater on the albums mentioned above."
5,"Lady Diana, you've done it again!","This should be subtitled ""When I Look in Your Eyes, Part 2."" Diana Krall has produced a wonderful follow-up, with great songs (the after-hours kind), great sidemen (Russell Malone, Christian McBride, etc), great arrangements (Claus Ogerman), great sound (Al Schmitt), etc.Congratulations, Lady Di...another winner!!!"
2,Boring,"This was my second Diana Krall disk. I received the first one as a gift and I loved it. As soon as ""The Look of Love"" came out I purchased it. I like her voice and singing but I was dissapointed in this disk. There are too many very slow numbers on it. There needs to be more of a mix. As much as I like her singing, I found this boring. I'd have a hard time recommending it based on that."
2,PLUCK THE STRINGS,"This is the latest offering from a very tellented singer/pianist.The voice is very good, but the orchestra is an unnecessary addition.the orchestra plays everything very slowly, they perform appaulingly. If they played like this at a classical concert,it would cause a mass walk out.The accompanying marketing photographs are tacky,sexist and unnecessary.Don't buy it, instead buy her LOVE SCENES or anything by Carmen McRae."
4,Not my favorite but good,"This CD doesn't quite measure up to Diana's last CD WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES, but its is pretty satisfying. If you like the piano stylings of BEEGIE ADAIR, you'll like Diana Krall playing also.."
2,Diana Krall The Look of love,This type of record has been done so much better by many others.You can hardly hear her voice over the overproduced orchestra. Diana doesnt have a strong enough voice to pull this off. It is a shame that such mediocrity gets hyped up so much these days.
5,what can I say? Diana Krall rocks!,Everything she puts out is perfect. I basically put on all of her cds at once and play them over and over. This cd is especially polished. You can hear the changes and perfecting of her voice over the years. This cd makes you want to get a really good glass of wine and just relax while enjoying both.
3,over produced,"I'm an on-air jazz dj. Have been following Diana Krall's career for many years. Diana Krall is a clear, luscious talent whose let herself be over produced a second time. Both this release and her last have pulled her away from her essential genious:straight up, swinging jazz in a trio setting.It's difficult, however, to keep a good woman down, and her simple exquisite timing, timbre, and soul shines through nonetheless.Not nearly as interesting a release as her first several, but if you love her, don't hesitate."
2,What a disappointment!,"Diana Krall is one of the few great jazz pianists and vocalists to come along in many years. I have all her albums, and I am a huge fan. This album is, I hope, the last in a downward spiral of marketing agents run amok. Someone decided to take a great jazz musician and transform her into a ""Sex Kitten Accompanied By Strings."" The modeling photos and the(muzac-like)symphony orchestras are an insult to a musician who is at the top of her form in her earlier albums with just her trio or quartet. Please, please Diana, lose the phony image stuff, and get back to the very solid, hard-swinging jazz albums that place you in the ranks of the jazz greats."
1,This CD is BROKEN!,"I hate to give this CD such a low rating because I like the music (not her best but I would have rated it 4 stars). Unfortunately, this CD appears to be ""protected"" by one of those new copy protection schemes that adds noise to the CD.On my 3 cd players I could hear a clicking sound every 10-15 seconds. It's barely audible, but now that I've heard it I always hear it. More frustrating, however, 3 of 5 computer CDROM drives I tried won't even read the disc.I hope that Universal stops this insane practice. It completely destroys my enjoyment of the music."
4,No more strings,"Why do jazz singers think they need to record with strings? Chris Connor couldn't pull it off. Shirley Horn couldn't pull it off. And neither can Diana Krall - although she does it better than most. After a disappointing rendition of I Remember You (one of my all time favorite ballads), she comes back with one of the best recordings I've heard (including Ella's) of Cry Me a River; and possibly outdoes even Nat Cole on Besame Mucho. Diana Krall is the best thing that's happened to Jazz in thirty years, and it's sad to see her tainting perfection with orchestral accompaniements. Her best is intimate, with just Russell Malone, Christian McBride, Jeff Hamilton, and the outstanding piano style of Diana herself. All those violins just get in the way."
2,Embarrassed,"This is an over-produced disaster. The musicianship we want to hear is DK not the London Symphony Orchestra. Not a jazz lick to be heard, just ballads with too many strings. I'm embarrassed that so much talent was wasted."
5,The Look of Love is in her work.,"Diana Krall is a talent that enters in upon the human community once in every 100 years. I am fortunate to be alive at the same time. In this collection, she reaches into our psche to wrest control of what we know we are: bodies of emotion and anticipation. I have not heard this kind of musical arrangement since the great Antonio Carlos Jobim conspired with Claus Ogerman to steal our hearts away. Graceful, masterfully delivered, the lady lets us know who is charge of our emotions."
4,Love it!!,I heard this CD while I was in vacation this summer and I love it. Diana Krall has a very specail voice and I just happen to love her voice.
5,The Look of Love,This is a wonderful CD from beginning to end. Diana Krall's voice is sultry and sexy and is the perfect backdrop for a romantic evening or just relaxing at home. You won't be disappointed!
2,Her worst CD,"I don't know what Diana Krall was thinking when she made this CD. Maybe she thought shifting away from jazz would increase her popularity. Well, I don't think so... not if this is the result. Its a very boring, uninspiring CD with unremarkable songs. Thankfully, she has started to move back toward jazz with her CD ""The Girl In The Other Room."""
3,I expected much more after........,"I am the proud dutch owner of 4 former Diana Kral cd's which I all Like for a different purpose; Love Scenes,All for you,Only trust yout heart and When I look in your eyes.I had great expectations when I orderd this cd, but it is a bit dissapointing. I think only one word tranlates my feeling after hearing this cd. 'FLAT'. You put it in your player and after 10 tracks it's silent in my room again and I can't remember what I heard before!, for this kind of easy listening I rather stap into an elevator. Diana You can do much better!"
2,Not up to her usual standard.,"This is the first CD by Miss Krall that disappoints me. Her voice is, as always, marvelous but the screeching violins make me sick. As for the cover art, who cares? I buy CDs for the music not the pictures. She could have a plain white wrapper and if I thought the music was good I'd buy it....... O.K., she's gorgeous but that doesn't make up for the bad orchestra."
5,"Sultry, classic, beautiful","Even though I love my other three Diana Krall albums, I was a bit hesitant to get this one because of some of the reviews. Don't be! It's softer, and less jazzy, but her vocal are sublime and the support of her quartet and the London Symphony Orchestra are a perfect match for her smooth style. S'Wonderful, Cry Me A River, I Remember You, and Dancing in the Dark are standouts in this seamless album of sensuous music. This one won't be leaving my CD player for awhile now!"
2,Come back Diana!,"I was hugely disappointed with this CD. She keeps moving farther and farther away from her jazz roots. I would have never believed that she would start doing Burt Bachrach tunes with schlocky orchestras arrangements. If you had only heard this CD and none of her earlier releases, you would never guess that Miss Krall is an excellent piano player. In fact, you can barely hear any piano at all. I saw her in concert weeks before the release of this CD and she only played one tune from it. I can see why now.The only positive thing I can say about ""The Look of Love"" is that she looks smoking hot in the artwork."
2,Why?,"Diana has some strengths as a fine pianist and a decent singer with loads of originality. Unfortunately, this album does not display any of them. This dumbed-down muzak must have been the idea of a record label and not of the artist. If you listen back to Krall's original stuff, it bears no resemblance. Come on Diana, go back to making real jazz."
3,Diana - I was disappointed!,"Diana Krall is the most exciting performer to hit the stage in a long time. I love her piano style, her smoky voice. But this album disappointed me. There are few songs on the album that feature Diana singing with her trio and jazz musicians often make the mistake of allowing someone to talk them into playing 'with strings' which in Diana's case as with the late Chet Baker are unnecessary. I found the strings distracting and although her choice of tunes is great she really did not give her usual flawless renditions, she sounded like an 'ordinary' band singer, which she is not. I saw her a few years ago in a small club playing on New Years Eve, she had her trio with her including the great Russ Malone and this is how I want to remember her."
2,Looks like success has ruined Diana Krall,I heard her in concert a few months ago. She was great. Where have the hard driving piano improvs and innovative swinging vocals gone? 'The Look of Love' is very little jazz (mostly pop) with maple syrup poured all over it. I hope it didn't ruin my CD player!
2,Dreary and boring...,"Diana Krall's ""When I Look in Your Eyes"" was a great album which should have won the Grammy for Best Album of the Year. But Santana got the sentimental vote that year. (I digressed.) This album is boring and dull...put me right into a stupor. Every cut sounds the same....sloooowwwwwwwww and lifeless. She sounds like she was on downers when she made the recording. With the exception of the first song 'SWONDERFUL and the title song, everything else is forgettable mush."
3,Blue moody,"This is not Diana at her best in my opinion. It is a quite slow and moody almost to the point of melodramatic. Her spanish inBesame Mucho is a bit over articulated as Bay Sa May which drives me crazy when I listen to it. If you are an die hard fan, you will probably like it but not love it."
1,The Look of Love,"I was very pleased to see that Diana was releasing a new CD so I pre-ordered (very convenient). While I know that this was another step forward in her musical career, I was disappointed with the syrupy arrangements and heavy strings. She is an incredibly accomplished musician and songstress and I was looking forward to another well-crafted, intimate jazz album, with tight arrangements, showcasing her voice as well as her excellent piano skills and that of the other fine jazz musicians in her group. I would not have purchased this if I had heard the musical clips on Amazon"
1,BIG DIANA FAN! HUGE DISAPPOINTENT!,"Sure, the album photography is great, her voice is great, as is her piano skills, but like another reviewer so poignantly noted, this is not jazz...it's Lawrence Welk's greatest hits. Seriously, (and I hate saying this), but if you want to be bored to death, or at least put to sleep, listen to the orchestral arrangements and the soft violins and let this sleeper of an album take you away. I really hate saying this, becuase I have every other one of her albums, and besides a few tracks from her last album, I love just about every song she's recorded. I've seen her live twice and in televised performances...and let's just say I was expecting some more jazz-oriented tunes with great piano riffs and her super-sultry voice, and what I got was a bunch of sappy violins."
2,From Jazz pianist to elevator muzak DIVA,"I admire Diana as a(n)(ex) Jazz pianist/singer, who was discovered by Ray Brown who wrote the liner note on her excellent debut album ""Stepping Out"" with accomplists John Clayton and Jeff Hamilton. It was an excellent Jazz album with great piano playing and tasteful singing from Diana Krall.Material in The Look of Love is not bad music, but is not what she is capable of. I am not sure what people who liked her original style think, to me this is muzak, passable but so is Kenny G.Besides,after hearing Dusty Springfield's haunting ""The Look of Love"", Diana just does not do it for me."
1,A recording bordering on elevator music.,"I agree with the first reviewer. She has become more and more commercial and artisitically empty and uncreative. In answer to the question posed as to does her beauty make her less talented? No, her lack of talent makes her less talented."
2,"The Look of Love, Diana Krall",The producers of this album should be ashamed. They have taken a great vocalist and great jazz pianist and buried both under the London Symphony or worse. Suitable for the elevator but not for a jazz/pop collection. What a waste!
2,"Implausible historical characters, annoying litery devices","""Mr. Mani"" is the story of a Sephardic family over a couple centuries, told via one side of conversations, and going backwards in time. Both devices are hoary. I didn't believe for a second that the characters were of their own time. They were not even three-dimensional moderns. The prose alternates between plodding and precious. It's beyond me why this novel is well-respected."
4,"Good sander, Bosch not much help on dust adapter","Love the sander. Very controllable, works fast, not too noisy.For the life of me, I cannot figure why you bother with a dust port and no way to hook it to a vacuum or dust collection system. I did find a solution that works for me. Now, the dust collection is Festool-like. The Fein 921072K13 Step Adaptor here at Amazon is about 6 bucks. It is soft rubber. If you cut off the top two steps, the 1250DEVS dust port will fit inside the Fiein adapter (nice and tight). The large end of the Fein adapter fits very tightly inside the end of my Mr Nozzle hose (requires a little effort, but a tight fit is worth it.) Mr Nozzle is a great hose.The sander would be 5-star except for the required work-around. Bosch should just include an adapter to 1-1/4 or 1-1/2 in the package."
5,Bosch 1250 DEVS Review from a wood floor guy!,"I am very happy with this sander. I have already used it on two jobs and it delivers in every category. The aggressive mode is quite aggressive (so hang on) but I need that in some cases. Also as an orbital it is wonderful. Low noise, low vibration and great dust collection. For a guy who has tried Festool, Dewalt and Porter Cable this sander , so far out shines them all. Actually I rate it equivalent to Festool at half the price. I am still getting used to it and time will tell. I owned my 6"" Porter Cable for almost 7 years and it still works but not well. It also is not nearly as dust efficient. I am also very happy with the whole buying experience. As a skeptic for purchasing online I went out of my comfort zone and must say I am very satisfied. Thank you Bosch for making quality tools and thank you Amazon for making them affordable and delivering on time, as promised."
5,Great Sander,"I use this sander primarily for flattening/finishing table-tops and other large panels. When flattening, even with hardwoods you have to be careful not to remove too much to quick, and with finishing, once you get to the really fine sandpaper the swirls are almost unnoticeable.The only materials i use are black walnut, ash, cherry and hickory; with any of those materials, it maintains a very consistent orbit.It is a pleasure to use, but it would have been nice if it had it's own case, like most of the other Bosch tools.Made in Germany.If you can't find what you want in the Bosch tool lineup, take a look at Festool. They also make high quality tools."
5,Workhorse sander,"This sander, with its coarse and fine removal settings. is the most effective orbital i have ever used. Does the job without gouging. You might want to hang on when using the coarse setting. The only criticism i would put forward, is that i had to cob together a fitting in order to attach a vaccumm. I would think Bosch could provide something that would allow it to connect to a shop vac"
1,Bad service,"If the item says ""In Stock"" you order it overnight shipping because you need it and expect it next day. Then you are told it's coming soon. No good."
3,Overpriced but gets the job done,"It's hard for me to justify the amount of money I spent on this product. In the slower mode, it is no better than my (albeit smaller) Milwakee ROS. However, in the faster ""stock removal"" mode, it gets the job done even if it is a bit unwieldy. If you can connect a vac to this, the dust extraction is excellent. After spending the good part of a day at multiple hardware stores around town trying to find an adapter to match the dust port and my vaccuum hose, I was unsuccessful. Then I realized a 3/4"" no-hub(plumbing)coupling would do the trick. It did and saved me a lot of headache. Now I don't need any adapter for any of my hand tools with vac ports. The big box retailers should have the no-hub if Amazon doesn't."
3,What you should know about this cd,"First off, I would like to point to the contents of this disc, those being the album version of SUNDAY and two unreleased tracks titled DANELECTRO ONE and DANELECTRO TWO.Second, the music itself. The fact is that SATURDAY, while being in the traditional laid-back, stripped-down kind of feel that we have come to know and love from this band,is quite possibly one of the more boring songs we have ever heard from them. As for the unreleased tracks, they are both instrumentals, not unlike GREEN ARROW from their last full-length album, but also not nearly as interesting.In short, this album is for the truly hardcore fans only. Not a good, or even fair, representation of what they can do."
5,"""the sky was a carcinogenic tan""","My Dark Places stands alone among the most naked, poignant, exquisite writing I have ever encountered. Anyone unmoved by either its subject matter or the sheer beauty of Ellroy's prose must be clinically dead."
5,Honest and Brutal,"Mr. Ellroy takes on the difficult task of confronting the ghost of his murdered mother, and he deals with his confusion, anger, love and hate with an unparalleled honesty. I have not previously read Ellroy's fiction, but look forward to it now. It is rare for someone to write of their pain with such insight, without the sentimentality one generally finds in autobiographical works. Superb, gritty, and highly recommended."
4,"Harrowing, compelling, disgusting, and more","Readers now know why James Ellroy's novels are filled with so much evil and sordidness. As ""My Dark Places"" reveals, his novels are filled with mirror shards of his own life. The book is not for everyone (reading these online reviews shows that clearly). It is compelling to those who are drawn to his novels by the sharp dialogue, the seamy characters, and the sense that real life is exactly like his stories. I can't say I ""enjoyed"" the book just like I can't say I enjoyed driving past the scene of a car crash. But reading this book gave me the same feeling I get when I drive by the scene of a car crash. I had to look."
4,In case you ever wondered how he got that way,"James Ellroy's unique voice in contemporary crime fiction springs from events in his own life which are the basis for My Dark Places. This book reveals a tortured early life overshadowed by the murder of Ellroy's mother and subsequent contact with police along with an adolescent descent into petty crime and drug use. That the person portrayed in these pages manages to sublimate his demons and channel them into some of the best noir fiction ever written, is a remarkable human achievement. Those who love Ellroy's books should read this memoir for the insight into the man it provides and, also, for the pleasure of reading a real life version of what could easily be a typical Ellroy subplot to an L.A. mystery.Really interesting stuff. Read this and you will know why Ellroy seems stuck in L.A. in another age - and why he can make it come to life with such power."
3,here and there,"This book is readable,though not quite up to other reviews that led me to buy it...it is finally an obsessive, inconclusive whodunit, with interesting rooted-in-LA detail but I am less interested in J.E./s dissolute boyhood than he thinks I am."
1,"Disturing, disgusting and unnecessary","I was a huge fan of James Ellroy until I read 'My Dark Places,' now you couldn't give me one of his books to read. It appears that this book comes from a very sick, twisted mind, of someone who truly had no respect for his mother. The book is very distrubing, somewhat boring and very disgusting, I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Distasteful and wholly uninspiring,"Somebody bring me some water. I have just finished My Dark Places and need to gargle. Ellroy could not have portrayed himself any more convincingly as the author I would LEAST like to meet. From his choice of words and awkwardly- placed profanities, to his tacky pride and conceited name change, he doesn't seem to have evolved much in character since as a 10-year old he lapped up his father's propaganda about his mother. Poor dear Geneva - your son has disgraced you in the interests of his own 'success'. Poor Aunt Leoda - little Leroy never learned respect. In future books, I hope Leroy, I mean James, strives for better content, nobler content, white orchids. Let all the redheads rest in peace."
1,I agree with Pedantic's review.,"A sick, self-indulgent, waste of ink by a very sick puppy.The deeper you get into this book, the more you realize that it is going nowhere and very slowly."
1,"Disgusting, foul and obscene","The most depressing,horrible book I have ever read. I would not have continued it after the first 50 pages if it had not been the selection for the local book club. If you ever have the chance DON'T READ IT! It is a true crime/detective story about the murder of his mother and contains many disgusting, foul and obscene parts. It is truly amazing that with the many evil, black (not just dark) thoughts James Ellroy has/had about his mother and other murdered women in the L.A. area that he did not turn into a serial murderer himself. The only enlightening thing about the book is the question of how many other boys reading ""true crime"" books will accept his dark thoughts and evil suggestions as normal and be pushed into a private life as perverted as the one James Ellroy describes as his own. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone!"
3,Time to stop the search.,"""My Dark Places"" is about James Ellroy's search for the person who murdered his mother in 1958. The first half of the book is interesting and as well-written as any of Ellroy's novels. It deals with the circumstances of his mother's murder, his troubled adolescence, and background on his search partner, former cop Bill Stoner. The second half, which details Ellroy and Stoner's investigation, is tedious and gets nowhere. I think it's time for Ellroy to stop the search, forget about Mom, and get on with something else (like the cold war machinations of ""American Tabloid"")"
4,Not stylish but passionate,"I think most high school sophomores can write better sentences than Ellroy's which are devoid of any complexity like clauses and phrases. Most sentences begin with the subject and follow a monotonous pattern which is annoying. However, Ellroy's passion and powers of observation are rarities that impel the reader through the wasteland of his prose. The book is almost unbearably intense as he deals with the raw emotions of facing up to his guilt in emotionally abandoning his mother who was murdered when he was ten. He makes sleazy L.A. come alive; the reader can understand his attraction to this nearly evil place. This is a creepy but fascinating world."
3,One-Way Trip in a Fancy Car,"This initially provocative story was written with such great style, the realization that it wasn't making any real progress was slow in coming. One must appreciate the guts and talent it took to write it, but can't help feeling cheated & abandoned in a strange place. Perhaps that was his point."
3,An obsession too far?,"I love Ellroy's work and have read a lot of it over a relatively short space of time. His style is highly infectious, and carries a punch that makes many other novelists seem fay by comparison. The main interest of this book for me was where all that narrative style and drive came from (mainly reading lots of crime novels, it turns out). As a memoir it's troublesome. Excellent on childhood and adolescence, but ultimately tedious about the police work that obsesses the author and has inspired so much of his work. In fact, this latter aspect makes you wonder if you ever want to read another crime novel ever again. If that was Mr Ellroy's intention - to show us the prosaic reality - he's to be praised for his bravery. Maybe he's made enough money and is tired of the inevitable bull that comes with crime fiction 99% of the time. If not, he may be cutting his own throat... I guess we'll know the answer when we see what his next novel is about - assuming he writes one!"
3,Needed an editor,"James Ellroy is undeniably a great writer, and the story he tells here --the unsolved murder of his mother when he was ten years old, and how the fact marked (and almost ruined) his life-- is an amazing one. But the book suffers, in my opinion, from a lack of editing. You can't blame Ellroy for believing that every single detail about the case, and his struggle to solve it, is fascinating, but the truth is, the writing suffers from too many details--some of them, irrelevant and even boring. A good editor could have transformed great but raw material into what it should have been: a masterpiece."
4,Worth the money for intended uses,"Overall this knife is a great outdoor and survival knife. The materials seem to be fine and the design is truly functional. Definitely a great knife to own for backpacking, hunting, or survival situations."
5,Another fun one from Laurie,"We first found Laurie on Jacks Big Music Show and now we have all of the Laurie Berkner music to date. My daughter and I just love her music. This CD has some great songs on it. My daughter lives Moster Boogie, Pig on Her Head, Ice Cream Cone, The Cookie Bakers, the Valley of Vegetables, and more, and I love Clean it Up! I love how Laurie teaches children through her music and how her music is catchy. I don't mind listening to her CD's over and over."
5,The best for kids around!,"(**I am not writing a different review for all the CD's we have, I am just going to cut and paste, if you read one of mine already - you don't have to read again, but you can! It's worth it!! LOL****)My kids (and ME) LOVE Laurie Berkner, she is the best for kids music and we all dance to all the CD's that we have of hers (and trust me, we have quite a few!!) Get them all if you can - especially the DVD - her clothes are so colorful, they are very playful and my kids (and ME) LOVE LOVE LOVE HER!A+ to Laurie Berkner and also The Laurie Berkner Band! I wish she'd go on tour, I'd be there in a heartbeat! It's great clean music for your kids - I take them on the field trips with the Kindergarten classes and all the kids sing along!A MUST HAVE!"
5,We Love Laurie,"We have bought every Laurie Berkner CD that she has made. My daughter loves her. We started seeing her on Noggin & that was the end of it...my daughter was addicted. I love her music because it is catchy & easy to learn & sing along to for my daughter and for me. It doesn't drive me crazy like listening to Elmo sing or some of the other children's CDs that we have. Laurie is wonderful, just ask my 2 year old...she'll tell you!!"
5,What fun!,I love this CD - I listen to it even when my son isn't in the car! It really is upbeat and folky -- kids' music that isn't soo cutie that you can't bear to listen. It's great fun! I love her other CD's too!
5,Family Fun,"We absolutely LOVE this CD. I bought it after seeing Laurie on the Noggin channel. My two year old twins would stop and dance whenever her music came on. Our whole family loves to dance to it. It is also wonderful for distracting them from TV and arguements. All I have to do is put this CD on, and my girls are happy and dancing. Every night after dinner we put it on and dance. Thanks, Laurie for making a wonderful CD. I'm online now, trying to buy another!!!!"
3,"A significant Talent, but Can the ""I'm Sexy, Too"" Routine","Laurie Berkner has a lovely voice, and writes children's songs that are not bad. The problem is that lately, in every video and appearance that I see televised, she feels compelled to move and behave as if to say. ""I'm a sensual, sexual being too!, Not just a kids' star!"" This has a nauseating effect on me and many others, and tends to undermine her considerable gifts as a children's performer. I wish she could be satisfied with what brought her success, instead of feeling that it is her right, as a ""celebrity"", to show us that she is ""so much more"", and must be taken seriously as a ""whole woman"". It just doesn't work. And it's icky."
1,Disappointed purchase,"Laurie Berkner recently began appearing on Noggin, with 1 song videos. My daughter loves to watch Noggin. She cannot wait until Laurie's next song. I ordered the ""Buzz Buzz cd and it was a disappointment. The cd is very unrefined - quite possibly one of her first cd's. In fact my daughter gets upset when we play it. It is so different my daughter doesn't even recognie it. I wish it was identical to her ""Sound"" as she appears on Noggin. I would DEFINATELY buy all of her cd's if this were true."
2,disappointed,"I bought this CD based on the reviews for my 2 yr. old.Some songs are okay but the lyrics on some of the others do not make much sense. My daughter was scared by the way a few songs turn from a soft tone to a loud shout by the end of the song. (""There's a Little Wheel A-Turnin In My Heart"" and ""Pig on Her Head""). I really didn't like ""I'm a Mess"" which sounds like a heavy-rock/rap and also scared my daughter. I would recommend instead Karyn Henley's CDs which I found to be the best out there for the toddler age group (3-5 yrs). She tells stories between some of the songs which really engages my daughter. The songs are wholesome and innocent."
3,Not What I'd Expected.,"I purchased Laurie Berkner's 'Buzz Buzz', marketed as a companion purchase to John Lithgow's 'Farkle & Friends'. It came as a bit of a disappointment, as I was trying to select music for children that adults can enjoy as well. The two CD's do not seem well suited to each other. Lithgow's wit and comedy fused into an introduction to symphony orchestra has little in common with the giggly simplicity of Berkner's 'Buzz Buzz'. She has character to her voice, and is an adept vocalist. The CD is probably quite enjoyable to small children's ears, but at what cost to adult sanity? If you're already well stocked with 'Barney' and the like, you may want to add 'Buzz Buzz' to your collection. If you're trying to avoid purple dinosaurs and still stay tuned in to what your children are listening to, you may want to tune 'Buzz Buzz' out."
4,Fun Songs For Adults with Kids,"What I mean by the title is that there are some children's CD's that they love but grate on the nerves of adults. Most of Laurie Berkner's tunes are fun little diddy's to sing along with. Some can get a little tedious but for the most part, they are fun to play over and over. My kids really like them although they each have favorites.We have another Laurie Berkner CD,Victor Vito, and I think that Victor Vito is preferred over Buzz Buzz - at least it seems to be in the CD player more often.As an added note, my daughter likes to hear some of Laurie's tunes when they come on noggin (now nick jr.)."
4,Great CD for kids,My kids love Lauri Berkner! They are 2 and 4 years old. This is the second CD of hers that we have bought and they just love it. Their friends who ride in our car love the music too. This CD has some songs that are well known and then Lauri's originals. Highly recommend this!
2,save your money,"My 2 year old son loves to dance and listen to music. However, he is not that interested in this CD. Many of the songs are a little slow for his taste. He does enjoy watching Laurie Berkner's videos, but doesn't care for this. Neither do my husband or I! Take your money and buy a Backyardiagan's CD instead!!"
5,Awesome CD for kids AND parents,Laurie's lyrics and folk-songish voice make this a wonderful CD to listen to for both kids and adults. We have it in the car for car trips and we even listen to it when our daughter isn't in the car! Highly recommended!
5,Great for all ages,"We bought this cd after listening to Laurie's songs on Noggin. My 9 year old likes it as much as my 20 month old, and my husband and I enjoy it also! The songs are easy to learn with lots of repitition and fun lyrics. My toddler, who doesn't say many understandable words, sings along with this cd! BUY IT!"
3,Disappointed,"I bought this CD on a recommendation and am disappointed in it. Some of the songs are catchy, but many are not. The music is similar to many kids cds-which become boring to the adults who end up listening to them all day. So far, I have only found one kids CD that doesn't do this: Gwendolyn and the Goodtime Gang.My 18 month old is growing to like this CD-but, it certainly isn't in her top couple of favorites. It is nice to have a change of musical style from the others she enjoys, but I would not buy it again. Some of the songs just don't make sense at all-and they are not senseless on purpose.Perhaps it is better for a preschooler, but I still think that my daughter will prefer her other music over this one when she reaches that age."
5,You really can't beat Laurie Berkner for kids music!,"I'm a bit biased, because our family has had the pleasure of attending several Laurie Berkner concerts in a relatively small setting, but my whole family really loves her music! We have all the CD's, but ""Buzz Buzz"" is the all-time favorite and is almost always on in our minivan! My son, who just turned 4, knows all the goofy & funny lyrics by heart and never gets tired of it! On occassion, after dropping off kids here and there, I've found myself singing along to this CD, alone in my car, which cracks me up when I realize what I'm doing! It's not possibly to be in a bad mood with Laurie's music on. Buy this CD and you'll surely be back for more - I'd try one with ""We are the Dinosaurs"" on it next. Enjoy!"
3,Not stellar,"My daughter is growing to like this CD as she listens to it, but it took a while. Perhaps it's not ""boppy"" enough? But it has cute songs and as she gets older she may like it more and more."
5,Favorite Kids' Album,"We got this CD as a gift, and once we cracked into it, we couldn't stop. There are so many annoying children's songs out there, but Laurie Berkner writes catchy, quality music that's for kids but which we adults appreciate too. This is a fabulous album, and with so many songs, it's hard to get tired of it."
5,Kids love her,My daughter is 3yrs old. She absolutely loves these songs. They are cute & catchy (yes you will find yourself singing them while you do dishes). Great music for small kids....gets her dancing.
5,so much fun!,We just got this cd after see Laurie Berkner on Noggin and it is so much fun -- I'm enjoying it as much as my 2 year old son! Perfect of any young child!
5,TRUE: the Ani DiFranco of kids' music,"The reviewer couldn't be more right... If you like Ani DiFranco and you have kids... you will be able to tolerate listening to this album as many times as they want to listen to it. If you don't like Ani, then you probably won't like this album. I liked it a lot!"
2,beginner software,"This was confusing for an 8 yr old who wants to learn to play. It didn't show how to place fingers on keyboard, went on from the assumption of knowing finger placement and how to read music already."
4,Table of Contents,"As shown on http://vufind.uhls.org/vufind/Record/800134/TOC, the stories included are:The watchful poker chip of H. MatisseThe veldtHail and farewellA medicine for melancholyThe fruit at the bottom of the bowlYllaThe little miceThe small assassinThe anthem sprintersAnd the rock cried outInvisible boyNight meetingThe fox and the forestSkeletonDandelion wineKaleidoscopeSun and shadowThe illustrated manThe fog hornThe dwarfFever dreamThe wonderful ice cream suitThere will come soft rains."
4,Overvieew of history,I have used this book in college and for preparing high school classes. I find the explanation of historical events to be clear and systematic. The supplemental charts are easy to follow. I recommend this book for finding good explanations for the events that the United States was involved in and about the key players at the time.
4,Worth the wait,I've been looking for this album since 2002. I finally got it and it was good. There first CD is better but this was a good follow up
4,Nice to listen to!!!,A very nice blend of pleasant sounds to have around. Life is good. God is good.
4,Compass,Auto and Marine Compass - BlackThis is a standard compass with a flexible mounting. It looks to be durable and will probably outlast me.
4,"Hi Rollin""",I have been looking for music by Bill Black and his Combo for years. I had a couple of old 45 records and wanted more. I found this cd on the internet. I had a friend order it for me. What a great a CD set. Nice music to listen by with all the great old 60's music. A really nice selection of songs.
5,I thought it was great,"I read some other reviews about the late Dr. Fix citing his prior works as source material for this book - generally a 'no no' in academia. However, I thought this book was exceptionally well written, easy to follow (it has been along time since I took Organic Chem) and if one goes thru the Bibliography, one will find ALL the most noted researches in this field cited liberally. Highly recommend this as one of your go-to books on the science behind the beer."
4,good book,"It's got good information, but shouldn't be the first book you pick up to understand a little of the science of brewing."
2,Written for the Ph.D Chemistry Major,"I do not know who this book was written for but it was not the homebrewer. It reads like it was written for the head chemist at Budweiser or a graduate school chemistry course. If you didn't major in chemistry or have been out of school a few years, it reads like a textbook. There is some interesting information in the book but you have to dig it out. Unless you really want to get very technical about the chemical changes during the brewing process, this book has little use for the average brewer."
4,Excellent - improved over 1st Edition,"George has cleaned up this edition and offers many more citations and support than in the first edition. The style is scientific, clear and concise. George is not afraid to get into the hard topics. This is an excellent introduction to brewing chemistry throughout the cycle."
3,Good read.,I got this book looking to expand on my knowledge of yeast ranching...ehhh it was a good read and had some great and more in-depth descriptions of the mashing and fermentation processes....in review...he did provide me with insight and caused me to change my mash schedule.
1,Unreadable.,Gore Vidal phoning it in. Vidal's contempt for the genre reeks on every page. I expected a masterpiece - how could it be otherwise. Gore spent a lifetime selling himself as America's Greatest Writer.
1,Vicious verbosity,"This book is almost unreadable. First, physically. It is a paperback, but very thick and heavy, and does not allow easy reading except on a table; almost impossible to read in bed.Second, subject matter. These are the ravings of a totally unbalanced mind. Yes it is arcane and interesting to see how someone (admittedly brilliant) thought so long ago. And he had an opinion about everything! Everything, I say! Talk about motormouth. He goes on and on long after anyone could possibly find him interesting. Oh, how this man needed an editor.Third, he is viciously anti-Catholic. Yes, I know it was (is?)the fashion in England for the best people to be anti-Catholic, but this guy can't be beat for vitriolic, venomous, bigotry. If you like that sort of thing, or some peekings into a pretty nasty anti-feminist, anti-modernity, deluded melancholy mind, be my guest.My advice: save your money."
5,Vivisect your mind,"Where to begin discussing this book? How about again and again? For it begs never to be put down, and if finished (as if that's even possible) to be picked up again and pored over. Again. And again. And again . . .It got Samuel Jonson out of bed earlier than he wished. It kept me up later than I wished, and still ""reading"" it in my mind over and over again, musing on the insanity of it - the brilliant, always entertaining, enlightening, LIGHTING bolts of language and thought crammed so mercilessly between two covers. It won't drive you mad, though, or mess with your humours, unless, of course, a sense of one you don't have - a bricolage (I think) to be devoured ravenously and chewed interminably like an everlasting gobstopper - a joy to exhaust your mind and body by . . ."
2,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","I had high hopes for this book based on Silverberg's name and that I tend to enjoy books about immortality, but this one fell flat. Like `thud'. It was short, shallow, and disjointed. The characters were 1-dimensional and there was little to keep me engaged except the hope it would somehow get better. While Silverberg has written some good material I have to recommend pass on this one."
5,Josh is tops!,I purchased this when it first was released and then loaned it and never got it back. This one happily replaces the lost one.
5,Josh,Love the guy who sings these songs. The man is multi lingual and sings like he knows the languages well. I loved listening
5,CLOSER toward PERFECTION !,"Harsh critics will blast this CD for being sentimental, orchestrated and syrupy. It may be all of the above, however, CLOSER is successful and as close a product can become to being listed as ""pop perfection"".If you're a speed metal fan, rest assured that you'll detest this release. However, don't hesitate to purchase this cd if you enjoy strong vocals complimented with solid musical arrangements evoking emotional responses from within.JOSH GROBAN demonstrates on CLOSER that he is presently the top male vocalist rating above any other currently listed on the music charts.The tracks on CLOSER such as WHEN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME , PER TE and YOU RAISED ME UP could be perfectly inserted as the scores/themes for major films. For those unaware of GROBAN's artistry and vocals quality; I suggest for you to imagine a younger ANDREA BOCELLI crossed with a lyrically gifted CLAY AIKEN.This is a great Adult/MOR Cd that is worth the price to own ! You will play it for years to come !"
5,Wow!,"This is an amazing album that will ultimately inspire those who here it. There is such a strong drive behind Groban's vocals, and that is a talent that not many have. I love listening to an artist who I know has real talent, and Groban has just that."
5,Truly amazing CD,"I have been a fan of Josh since catching him on Ally McBeal and he has only improved with time. I loved his first album and I actually have two copies of Closer - one for work and one for home! He has a truly amazing talent and can bring me to tears with his songs ""To Where You Are"" & ""Remember When It Rained"". Josh sings every song with such passion & emotion that you start to imagine he's singing directly to you. I highly recommend buying all of Josh's CDs & DVDs, you won't be sorry.And if by some small chance you don't like it, forward it to S. E. Heimsath ""M. McFly's dentist. The dentist obviously has good taste in music. His patients are another story...."
5,beautiful voice and music,"this album is magnificent. i love the way josh groban sings. his voice is very big and flowing and the sounds he produces just flow into your ears. i really like the english songs on the album and they are about the only ones that i can understand. about half of the cd is spoken in other language, one is in french, then i think the others are in italian and perhaps there is one in spanish. i can only catch a few of the words in the foreign songs but the voice allows you to still enjoy the musci even though it is in another language. the cd is great and his voice is the true achievement, i love it on the cd, but i can only imagine what it is like to here him live."
3,Start with Josh...then move on to the Masters,"Josh Groban is a refreshing young voice in a time of talentless commercialized hype. He is professional and polished, and it will be interesting to observe his progress in the years to come. Those who are interested in pursuing music ""a cut above"" the norm will do well to hear his latest offering. However, in reviewing recent comments, I must concur 100% with the guidance of those who have referenced the work of Dmitri Hvorostovsky. A well trained ear will recognize that voice as a gift of God...truly divine and rare. There is no singer alive who compares. If you are now beginning to develope a taste for music along more classical lines...Josh Groban is a good point to diverge from the tedium of pop culture. But do give yourself the opportunity to hear Hvorostovsky; you won't regret it and his voice will open you to a whole new world of understanding and appreciation!"
1,More vibrato than a violinist with a hand spasm,"Why on earth is this guy popular? He's young, and he can sing. Big deal, my four year-old has perfect-pitch, can she make an album please? I find Josh Groban's voice so annoying, I can barely stand it. He wavers with vibrato on every single note that he holds longer than 2 seconds. I guess it's good that I am so distracted by it, so I don't notice the really bad songwriting."
1,Farther Please!!!,"This cd is very boring. Josh Groban sings opera like music and has no style of his own. If he was a color, he would probably be clear. His voice is no better then most singers. He has no identity except the boring ugly guy with long hair."
1,Are you kidding?,"Groban's tripe is just another manifestation of sappy, consumerist bourgeois garbage - a perfect example of the crap the NPR crowd wants to be seen listening to. Give me a break."
1,The singing robot,Josh gorban has the most boring voice i ever heard it is so perfect pristene and boring. I would like this sissy to show some emotion when he sings. This guy is popular becasue middle age house wifes and lonely old hags like his boring music. Also this guy is in his early 20s why does he sound like he is 60. Old ladies there is better music out there but this review would be longer than war and peace if i were to name all of them
2,"Haven't bought it, wouldn't buy it","Very simply - no matter how beautiful a voice he has, I want to hear songs that I understand. Why can't he do a CD totally in English?"
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the CD because a lot of the songs were not in English so I could not understand the lyrics
1,Stick a finger in your mouth?,"""Soothing voice?"" Is what one member says about Josh Groban. Sorry, but soothing voices come from many other fine music artists. But, I can't put this guy, Josh into any list. I like singing, not moaning!"
3,Disappointed,"Josh has a great, great voice, but most of the songs a too similar on this CD. Variety is lacking. I would also like to have more songs in English."
3,ohhh!!!!,"this cd isn't good,his 1st cd is better than this,i love his 1st cd so that the reason 4me to think&bought this album,but then i was really dissapointed!!!!!!he had the best male vocal in the world,strong,powerful,he's very talented.......i loved ""my confession"",it really good,my mother like this song too much.......& Perte is the next good song in this cd!!!!!!ok,it just my opinoin but if you want to have more best music,you should but his 1st cd!!!!!"
3,I wish,"I would like to get a CD of this wonderful voice without a rehash of previously recorded works used as fill ins,"
1,Unable to play this CD using PC,"I love the voice of Josh Groban, but I was unable to listen to this CD using my computer.***BE ADVISED: If you enjoy listening to CDs on your pc, DO NOT purchase this CD.***In an effort to prevent 'piracy,' the record label has included copy-protection software that prevents legitimate consumers from listening to the music on ANY computer. I wish I had known this before I purchased the CD. I was shocked and disappointed when it didn't play."
2,What a sonic toilet,"First of all, Josh Groban DOES have a great voice. Seriously, the fella would kill on Broadway in a couple more years. That said, this album is gawd-awful. Overwrought production, cringe-inducing faux-emotional balladry, and pretentious foreign language tracks make this a nearly unlistenable piece of tripe, and positions Groban as the male Celine Dion. My opinion of Groban as an artist (not a singer, an artist) was not improved when I happened to see a 5-minute infomercial for ""Closer"" on TV one night; morbid curiousity dictated that I watch, and I'm worse off for it. Just like the CD, it was an agglomeration of phoney sentiment, a lot of soft-lensed, wistful stares into the camera or just off stage-right, and in the spot's most comical moment, a clip in which Groban has grown a ""beard"" that makes him look like Wolverine's testosterone-challenged younger brother. You wanna hear Josh Groban? Wait until he plays the Phantom, or Valjean. Don't buy ""Closer."""
5,He's Done it Again!,"I didn't know it was possible, but Josh has topped himself! His voice has grown so much in two years, and this album is a joy to listen to! We can't wait to see him in Boston in February!"
4,It's definitely different...,"This is an overall great CD. It's good to see that Josh has crept out from under the wing of David Foster, and has provided some personal input into the song selections and style of this album. A few more new original songs would be nice, and the version of 'Broken Vow' doesn't really compare to the live version on his CD/DVD release. But Josh's own 'Remember When It Rained', is a great song and really conveys the vastness of Josh's voice and talent. 'When You Say You Love Me' is also noteworthy, as is Josh's duet with violinist Joshua Bell. Josh is truly a very talented, powerful, and passionate singer, and this album really defines a ""new Josh"" compared to the debut album. He's not just ""Opera Boy"" anymore."
3,Closer,"This CD is very similar to Josh Groban's first album. While this style has been successful, perhaps it is time for him to try something new.The songs he has chosen for this album are quite relaxing and calming. It is easy to listen to the whole CD without growing tired of the sound (as often happens with other genres of music). However, as in the first album, Josh's voice is often drowned out by overemotional and exaggerated orchestration.On a somewhat unrelated note, many other reviewers have mentioned that they enjoyed ""You Raise Me Up"". I suggest listening to the song as performed by Secret Garden on their album titled ""Once in a Red Moon""; that rendition is even better."
5,Perfect christmas gift!,This CD is really great. Josh is really good and I gove him a 10 out of 10 raiting!
4,Wonderful music,Even if you aren't a fan of the genre you can't help but be drawn in by Groban's beautiful voice. The biggest draw for me was that he's my age. The first time I heard him was at the Olympics and ever since then I've been a huge fan.
3,Farther...,"Josh Groban had the most emotive, profund, energetic voice I've heard, other than the big names in operal, like Bocelli. I would not mistake them for each other however. Anyway, I'm listening to this album right now, and I'm wondering what happened. The songs are good, though a tad bit alike, and his voice is better than ever; but these aren't ""CD"" songs. I can't feel them through my speakers. I'd be thrilled at a concert, but several of them are distant for me. I would like to hear this live before judging.I feel his first CD is more listen-able. Has more variety. But this one is far more emotive. Don't think much of the song choice. Enjoyed about 70% of the songs here. Song-wise, a disappointemnt since his last CD, but voice wise, he's better. I'd recommend you take it out at the library, see if you like the music, and see how it sounds through the speakers."
5,wonderful voice,"It is so nice to hear a beautiful voice sing new songs to listen to. I can understand all the words (in English, of course) and enjoy my kind of music."
5,Impressive!,"Before buying this CD, my hope for it was that it would be at least as good as his first. Well, it far surpassed all expectations! The words that first come to mind when listening are ""grand"" and ""powerful"". It blew me away. Beautiful!!"
3,"Beautiful Voice, Mediocre Selection of Music","Josh Groban's voice is so beautiful. His first CD was a pure delight, track after track. This CD does have its bright spots, ""When you say you love me"" and the much overplayed ""You lift me up"". However the balance of the the CD falls short, not with his voice but with the song selection. Because there is so much hype for this CD, I wanted listeners to be aware of the inequality between the first and the second CDs. If you just love his voice, by the CD. I hope you are not dissapointed."
3,"You hear one, and you hear them all","I expected to see some variety in Josh Groban's second solo album, but I was disappointed. Even with French and Irish tunes exploited, still they were arranged in the same style and therefore sound very much the same, plus the over producing, in the end it is Josh Groban debut all over again. Some tracks, had they been produced simpler, could retain more individuality and the beauty that comes with it. Having said this, I think Josh Groban has obviously put more of himself into the singing, and we now hear more of his high register. His ""Caruso"" is good, although really not in the same league as Andrea Bocelli."
2,Quel disappointment...,"""You raise me up"" is the only song on the album that caught my ear. The rest were flipped through after a few measures. Where are the stirring songs like ""gira con me"" etc? And ""Broken Vow"" - egad - a beautiful song that Josh turned into a mediocre ballad with little or no emotion. His phrasing is off and I can't stand hearing ""letchu"" instead of ""Let You""...where was his voice coach on that one? All in all, a snoozer...very disappointing for his second studio effort."
2,I don't get it . . .,"Ok, I agree the guy can sing, but I just don't get his popularity. This album is just tiring to listen to. The vocals are over the top, as is the music.I want to understand, I really do. Can someone enlighten me?!"
1,No wow factor,"I have nothing against Josh. He has a good voice, but sadly, this album is no better than his first one. The selection of songs are so similar to his previous album, and its kinda like a repetition. Nothing as changed. Personally, I find this album boring, and prefered his first cd . Sorry Josh."
3,A mediocre effort,"If you ever hear Secret Garden's version of You Raise Me Up, you'll see that this is an inferior version. Emotion is clearly lacking here."
1,Closer,"I've been a Josh Groban fan from the moment I saw him on Ally McBeal a few years ago. His first CD was the most amazing CD I've heard. I'm sorry I can't say the same for his third CD (If you want to count Josh Groban in Concert as his second)...I waited so long for this CD..I am so disappointed. Sorry Josh, Please try again."
4,"Josh Groban ""Closer"" CD","This is not my favorite Josh Groban CD, mainly because most of the songs are in a foreign language. BUT, just hearing Groban's voice, no matter what the language, is a thrill."
5,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"THIS CD IS FANTASTIC. THE VOCALS ARE SO STRONG IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THEY ARE IN ENGLISH, FRENCH, SPANISH, AND ITALIAN. THE PASSION COMES THRU LOUD AND CLEAR. I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAITED SO LONG TO GET THIS. IT'S PLAYED NEARLY EVERY DAY. EVEN MY 4 AND 7 Y/O SING TO IT."
5,A God-sent Talent,"Very rarely a singing talent comes along who stuns you with their ability. Josh Groban has so much talent for such a young man. His ability to intrepet songs like ""Broken Vow"" makes me wonder if he can truly be so young. As a woman who lived his lyrics, I am shaken each time by his passion and beautiful voice."
5,Incredible,"That's the simple word to define what this CD is like - incredible. Josh's gift of singing is awe-inspiring. The music on this CD trancends to another level of music untouched before. I could have this CD playing all day and never, ever, get bored or skip over a song.It, again, is wonderful to hear such powerful songs in other languages. French, Spanish, Italian - regardless of if you speak these languages, you know that the songs would not hold the same meaning in English. Awesome, awesome stuff.Josh's vocal range is fully tested on this CD, ranging from extreme lows and highs, but always on perfect pitch. The background, whether guitar, piano, or orchestra, adds excitement and helps build the pieces to the extraordinary levels that they are at.Josh's first CD is awesome, but this one has even surpassed that. Someone stated earlier that Josh was like ""nails on a chalkboard"". This couldn't be more insanely wrong. It is like pure beauty. Get this CD, you will fall in love with it."
5,Excellent,CD arrived in excellent condition and is exactly what I have been looking for. Easy to listen to while I am reading.
3,Josh Groban,"Good, of course, because it is Josh Groban, but beside Bocelle's Vivere which I bought at the same time, this is not in the same league."
4,One of my most played CDs,"I love this CD! Of all of Josh Groban's CDs, this one's my favorite. His voice is amazing, but the accompaniment is lame. I ignore it, but I think those that don't like Josh Groban would like him more if the accompaniment was better."
5,Great!,"Josh Groban is just fantastic! English, Italian it doesn't matter it all sounds so good I have actually learned the Italian lyrics on Josh's first release. Highly recommended."
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,"Compelling work!!! The whole CD, from start to finish, is absolutely amazing. From Oceano to Il Postino, to the bonus track She's Out Of My life, every song soars with Josh's incredible vocals. Two songs in particular are my favorites: Remember When It Rained and You Raise Me Up. The former is poignant and bittersweet, and builds to an almost surreal, spiritual-like crescendo while the latter brings tears to my eyes. My mother just passed away recently, and this song reminds me of how inspiring and powerful she was to myself and so many others. This is not merely for listening. It's an experience. Pick up this CD. You'll be glad you did."
5,Kirkunik1,"Josh Groban is going to be big. Very big. His voice is pure, natural, and with a range and power not to be dismissed as any take off of anyone else. He has expression and passion that far exceeds most seasoned singers. This is a beautiful album. As far as singing in other languages goes....who cares....its the voice and the music. Overproduced? Only to immature listeners who have been spoon fed bad music for so long they don't recognize excellance when they hear it. Groban brings beauty back."
4,Josh Groban has what it takes,"Josh Groban has incredible talent and a mature understanding of musical selections. His first album may be my favorite album ever from any artist, so it would be difficult to improve upon this on his second try. 'Closer' is a terrific album but it does not have the same impact as Groban's first. The classical songs are excellent but the choice of popular songs is not quite as strong. I still highly reccommend this album and eagerly await his next effort."
4,"Quick, excellent service; excellent album.","Quick, excellent service; excellent album. Quick, excellent service; excellent album. Quick, excellent service; excellent album. (Isn't this simple comment enough?)"
5,By far my favorite Josh Groban album,"I love every song on this album. I wish he would return to music like this. I used to be a huge fan, but his last two albums have been a big disappointment to me."
3,not as good as the first album,"The first album was great, i wish he took more time to perfect the follow-up."
4,4.75,"Another excellent effort from Josh Groban...cant say enough about this artist...I am not one to listen to this type of music for the most part, but when you put this CD in or the earlier CD, you are taken to a place that gives you great peace of mind and comfort...these songs are just beautiful...musically and lyrically. Only draw back is that it seems every other song is in Italian...therefore, it can be hard for the average listener to understand...even then..the songs are beautiful...great job!!!"
4,Closer to his heart...,"Josh brings the listener closer to his heart with with tracks When You Say You Love Me, and with the one he co-wrote, Remember When It Rained. His voice has matured in the two years since his debut album and can more powerfully evoke tears from the listener. Inspired collaborations with artists like Deep Forest, give a new spin to the 'popera' Josh's voice produces.I would however eliminate the track Caruso; it sounds more like a speech in Italian set to background music. Despite the flub of including this one and his try Broken Vow, the album is fabulous."
5,SPECTACULAR,"I first heard Josh on the radio in Oct 2002 (not sure why it took so long) and couldn't believe the voice I was hearing on a top 40 station...exquisite, soothing, beautiful, etc, etc, etc. Loved the first CD and Closer is just as good if not better!! Josh has enormous musical talent that continues to improve. Hi song co-writing ability is captured in Remember When It Rained (great piano playing also), Per Te and Never Let Go. Mi Mancheral, When You Say You Love Me, My Confession, Oceano, You Raise Me Up, Hymne A L'Amour, etc...all of the songs on the CD capture JG's talent and are a joy to listen to. Singer, song writer, piano player...can't wait to see what the future will bring."
3,"***** 5 star for his voice, but...","I am giving 5 stars for Josh voice and his singing, and 2 stars for the song selection. ""Closer"" is much further than his first CD, which I think was just great. There are 2 good songs, but the rest ???. Common David Foster, you can do better than that. Put a few fast ones. A lot of people are listenning on their way to work... you don't want them to fall asleep, do ya? What about song Caruzo? It's done by Bocelli perfectly. Is David trying to prove that Groban can do a better job? Have no idea.... Let's release the third CD and let's make better song selections, because Josh is one of the best singers around who deserves standing ovation. Cheers."
1,boring,you'd think dude was linked to the American Idol Chain for life with the over the top Production&the way He is presented with His vocals.nothing really stands out for me.His Albums thus far are just kinda there.he has talent but seems way to formula driven for a cat so fresh into there career.
1,Simply Awful,"This album is pathetic. Why on earth does a young guy like that wanna make opera music. At least he could make cheesy pop. That would be better than this. I don't understand how any young, American (i think he's Amarican) guy would wanna make this kind of music. How dare he! This is the worst music I have heard in a long time. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it."
1,0 Stars,"What the world needs now is NOT an opera version of Clay Aiken! or should I say opera-wannabe version. Do yourself a favor and get the ""Cabaret"" soundtrack of the movie for some REAL MUSICAL TALENT. F-(-)"
3,you suck josh groban,I give you two years until you release a christmas album and then dissapear forever.
1,Who needs opera?,I was disgusted when I listened to this cd. It was even more horrible when I saw all the good ratings this cd got. This cd is just some kid singing opera and other boring songs. If you wasnt to listen to good music I recomend you look just about any where else
2,Disappointing,"I looked forward to Josh Groban's second album as I absolutelyloved his first. His voice was so powerful, emotional and personal. What I especially enjoyed was the way the music did not overwhelm or substitute for the vocals.This album evocked this comment: ""My God, he's been Celine Dioned""! My partner, a musician, simply said: ""Sounds like songson a hollywood sound track."" There are dozens of albums like this and they all sound the same.I have a deeper appreciation of how a producer can make or breakyou. I am a huge fan of Eva Cassidy, who, in part, never becamefamous in her lifetime because producers didn't know what to dowith her wide ranging talent: jazz, folk, torch, ballad, etc. This album indicates a lack of appreciation for the voice bycommercializing the ""product"" to the point of blandness."
3,"Nice Baritone - yeah, nice baritone","There is no doubting that Groban has a very nice voice, but as another reviewer has said - anyone can go to a broadway production and hear the exact same quality of voice.As a professional singer, I wonder when he will ever come out of all the heavily mixed and post-produced recordings and let us hear his real voice? If he's studied music for real, let him release a simple CD of true vocal music. I think we would all be either suprised or horified... but it would be a nice change from the overwhleming synths and tacky Celine Dion string arrangements."
1,"Bogus ""Enhanced CD""","I specifically bought this CD for the song ""Raise Me Up"" and the promised additional exclusive video footage. As a result, I was not disappointed when all the other songs on the CD sucked.I was, however, let down when I found that the so-called ""Enhanced CD"" features were a scam. The only thing you get is a pop-up screen that only allows you to enter your e-mail address to sign up for their mailing list and has two links to the artist's and record label's website. There was no exclusive video footage at all.The record label, Reprise / Wea, claims, after you've already bought the CD, that, ""Oh, by the way, the so-called enhanced features do not work on all computers."" Well, the truth is that they do not work on older computers and they also do not work on the newer computers that have drives that can read and write both DVD and CD on one sole drive.This CD sucks. Download the tracks you like for .88 cents at WalMart and let the actual Closer CD rot on the retailers' shelves."
1,Durge !,"I met an old friend and he played me Josh Grobans''You Raise Me Up'. It sounded lovely and I wanted to get that lovely love song. I could not find the exact album on your Amazon site, so I chose something that might be near. Well, I am very sorry to say that this CD is highly depressing to me; not uplifting at all; so in fact a total waste of money.Also, what was confusing, it said that this CD was coming from the U.S.A. It had a price in dollars, 16 something. I do not know what I have been charged and the ultra confusing link the the U.S. was very strange to me, but I went along with it. If we get a huge bill my husband won't be happy! Please, Amazon, make your site easier. With many thanks, Helen of Troy."
3,Not as good as the First CD!,"As always, Josh sings the song so beautifully. But, I am a bit disappointed with the song selections. The only good songs on this CD are ""Remember when it rained"" and ""Broken Vow."" All the songs are too ""Deep"" and ""SAD"". I would like to hear the same ""Tempo"" as it was on the first CD. This CD is like a ""Mideocre"" as compared to the first CD release. Songs are a disappointment for a very talented artist like Josh Groban!!!...I would like to see a much better song selections hopefully, on the third CD!!!!!"
4,magical voice...,"Great songs and beautiful music....his voice is full of passion and magic...classic style...It would be even better if it had more selection of English songs in this CD...Can't understand the lyrics of many songs, but I do love his voice and the wonderful music."
4,Gave as a Gift,"Since I gave this item as a gift I can't give it a fair review, but I can say that my mother was very pleased to receive it and is enjoying it."
3,he has a nice voice,"guess I'm just over the same old same old sound he has.don't get me wrong, he is amazingly talented..... with a phenomenal voice,I just got a touch bored."
3,"josh groban - cd name ""closer""","I was not crazy about the songs josh sang. His best one was ""you raise me up"" which is a very good song for his young but not yet fully matured tenor voice. The rest of his songs I would rate between 4 and 7."
4,Another Recommended Buy,"Another definite must-have. Again, this is not a CD with only 1 or 2 good songs - there are several songs in this album that rate as beautiful/great -- melody, lyrics, and voice. You will not be disappointed with Closer. It is a great follow-up to his debut album."
4,What a voice!,"I first heard Josh Groban on Ally McBeal, and I fell in love! I couldn't wait to get his CD and hear more. I am so glad that I got ""Closer"" and I just want to listen to it over and over. The song ""You Raise Me Up"" is one of the best songs I have ever heard, and to hear him sing it gives me chills! You will not regret buying this album!!"
3,"Good, but not as good as his first","I had high hopes after hearing Josh's first CD, but this one just isn't as good. Some of the tracks are just too ""pop"". I did enjoy ""My Confession"", ""Broken Vow"", and ""You Raise Me Up"" (though I wasn't crazy about the loud choir in that arrangement). Other tracks, like ""Caruso"", were just okay (Russell Watson does a better job with that song).Don't get me wrong; this is a decent CD. But I hope Josh's next one is more along the lines of his first, at least in the selection of songs."
3,"He's got the pipes, but....","Josh, you sure can sing...this we are all agreed on. But pul-eeze, take some risks before you fade into obscurity. Challenge that magnificent voice we all love....sing something that really, really makes us say WOW. This CD is nice, yes, and safe...and dare I say, boring. Yawn. Do something crazy on your next CD...collaborate with some popular artists that we would love to hear your voice marry with...do something different....your voice can handle anything.....who is giving you career advice? Is that advice to never stray from the standard elevator music formula? You are 22 years old...this doesn't have to be your trademark....you are too young for this to be all we get from you....shake it up baby!"
3,Not as good as the first,"I heard the Josh CD in full today. Anticipating much I listened with full attention, but I don't get gripped by it. I will admit that his voice is beautiful, but to me, he lacks something. I must compare him to Russell Watson with 'The Voice' and even Mario Frangoulis.When Josh sings Secret Garden's You raise me up, it lacks the richness that the original singers brought to it..........plus the original song is in a higher key with a better arrangement.Same story with Caruso....................but the cd will sell very well.Many people do on about Josh playing piano on Remember when it rained. It's a simple piece to play.....nothing complicated!! Let's take off our blinkers and say that this is an average album.I like half of the songs on it."
5,Hallelujah! It's Josh Groban,"I am a very, very mature woman who has despaired of ever again hearing a young REAL artist such as Josh Groban! 22 years old and unbelievable in range, control and depth of feeling. I am in very pleasant shock and have given his CD's to my favorite friends and family members."
4,What a voice!,"His voice has the amazing ability to make me relax. If I'm stressed, I just pop him in to my radio."
5,Beautiful Soaring Music!!,This is truly beautiful music. Josh's 1st album was surprisingly wonderful. This is even better. Beautifully poetic and peaceful music.
5,great cd,"I really like this cd. Josh Groban is very talented. I got a feeling that Josh Groban is going to be around for a long time to come. I love his voice, he's someone that can really sing and he has a very respectful career. He's not going for the trends in music or doing anything tacky for publicity stunts. I'm glad to see a talented musician with class. Josh Groban sings opera but it leans more towards a mainstream pop/contemporary style. The cd booklet also comes with lyrics."
1,Do we really need this?,"The preference for singers is very subjective. But I would like to point out that we have a great pool of talents in our time and please don't miss them. If you like the baritone voice, please try any cds by Dimtri Hvorostovsky. He simply does not make bad cds. Other great voices you should at least try to listen to for once: Thomas Hampson, Nathan Gunn, Thomas Allen, Thomas Quassthoff, Bo Skovhus, Gino Quilico, Peter Mattei. By the way, most of these gentlemen are very easy on the eyes. I may as well throw in three tenors as bonus: Ramon Vargas, Juan Diego Florez and Michael Schade. If you have heard all of these singers and still think Groban's cd is the ""best thing"", then I am really speechless. Please don't call me a ""snob"" just because I would like to share with you some of the best voices in the world."
1,Nervewracking!,"Someone played me this cd in their car. For openers, I was not enthralled with the voice quality. Secondly, the very syrupy, sicky-sweet style throughout the cd is constant and can truly get on one's nerves after a few minutes. Yes, some of the tracks are written in foreign tongues. However, the music is always annoying, regardless of whether it is in English, French, Italian, Malaysian, or Swahili. I dislike Josh Groban's music. Perhaps that means I'm not a sensitive person. Oh, well."
1,Musical Blasphemer? INDEED!...,"Mr. Groban is an egregious musical FAILURE. As a longtime listener and sincere fan of all things musical, I can say that this warbling isn't musical. His voice is weak and lacking on so many levels it is rediculous. To the reviewer that had the audacity to compare Mr. Groban to Luciano Pavarotti: SHAME!To those thinking of buying this album: investigate other classic baritones and tenors, and for that matter-CLASSICAL MUSIC!! Do not limit yourself to this garbage, but rather stray from the darkness and into the light that is anything BUT Josh Groban. I suggest you read MaestroMike's review for a scholarly look into the proverbial cow dung with which Josh Groban has stained the musical market."
2,"Superior Against An American Idol World, But Is That Much?","Sure, he's miles ahead of the devoid Clay Aiken [who or what isn't?], but I still prefer `You Raise Me Up' when it was recorded as `Wind Beneath My Wings' and I didn't like it much then either. Bland quasi-classical in the same vein as Charlotte Church, his pro-nun-ci-a-tion more suited for the Broadway stage, stabs `Hymne a l'Amour' to stupefaction, misguidedly co-writes a few himself, and gets lost when he decides to get ambient. Groban seems intense in his beliefs, and credit him for not pandering, but, while he seems to love the sound of his own voice, the delivery remains soporific. My grade: C+"
3,Closer Review,"I like the Josh Groban ""Closer"" album its pretty good. I also purchase Whitney Houston's ""One Wish"" christmas album along with it. Whitney does a great job on her first ever christmas album. My favorites are ""Joy To The World"", ""O Holy Night"", ""Who Would Imagine A King"", and ""Little Drummer Boy"" her voice is just amazing and the Christmas album truly does help me get into the Christmas spirit. I would recommend both albums to anyone who loves good music!"
2,I liked it better when...,"1.) I liked Josh Groban better when...It was done by Loreena McKennitt or Enya.2.) I liked ""You Raise Me Up"" better when...It was done by Selah. (It's too soon after Selah made it a hit for a remake to come out. Josh's version is exactly the same except with the third verse cut out.)The only song I can actually recommend is ""Remember When It Rained."" He has a good voice but the songs are boring and done before. In a few years, he'll be the Michael Bolton or Kenny G of this decade."
5,I love Josh Groban,When i first heard Josh Groban it was on the radio and the song whas To Where you are Josh has a powerful voico that can blow you away. I have both of his cd pluse the dvd in concert and I just got the Troy soundttack with Josh Groban singing Remeber MeI went to one of Josh Groban;s concerts this summer04 and his is amazing in preson he really has a sense of houmor I can't wait until he comes out with a thrid cd and when Josh Groban comes in concert to where I live I would love to see him again in concert.His shows are amazing and I will remember to bring a camra next time if I see Josh Groban again Josh keep up the good work and I wll always remeber you and you will neaver be forgotten by all your fans
5,Better Than The First,Josh Groban's Closer is a masterpiece....I can hardly find a track I do not like...He did an exceptional job and in my opinon this is better than the first album he produced....Buy this it is great to listen to while taking a soak in the tub and trust me you will NOT be disappointed in fact you too may become a Grobanite! So give it a try!
4,Great Voice,"I think he has a great voice, and the music back him up well. I didn't love all the songs, but it is nice peaceful music to work with in the background."
5,"PASSIONATE SINGING, WONDERFUL VOICE!!!","Here is a young man with a big voice. Anyone hearing him without seeing him on his album would think they were listening to a grown man. His voice is deep and soulful, full of passion and ultra-rich, as he sings his heart out in the four languages of English, Spanish, Italian and French.My favourite is of course You Raise Me Up sung in English, and I can hear it over and again and again it only makes the tune better, and of course Oceano sung in French.What remarkable talent!!! What a remarkable voice!!! I love it.Heather Marshall Sugar-Cane Bridgetown 11/10/04"
4,"Truly Beautiful, But....","I think this is a very wonderful CD. Josh's singing is gorgeous, and even though it is over produced at times, it is well worth having and sharing with others.I cannot understand why there are no translations for the songs in Italian, Spanish and French. The liner notes are difficult to read and provide inconsistent information that is at best confusing.Considering the careful attention paid to all other aspects of the production of this CD, I find this missing detail to be very odd."
1,"Ladies & Gentlemen, THE NEW MICHAEL BOLTON!","I love all kinds of music (SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS for proof) This just has been released to annoy. And as another artist for Adult Contemporary radio stations to play to death.He may not sound like Bolton (no need to clear THIS throat) but he sings the same, sappy garbage. The previous reviewer who compares ""You Raise Me Up"" to Wind Beneath My Wings is dead on. I didnt realise it until i listened to it again.You Raise Me Up is one of those <sarcasm> sad tearjerker songs. Kind of like I'm Already There by Lonestar. Makes you want to weep in the cornflakes.Unless you are a panty throwing woman (or gay) you would be best to steer away from tripe like this. If you do like it, I recommend titles by Wilson Phillips, Air Supply, Kenny G and Yanni"
1,JUNK,"CRAP, not even good crap. Just a level below Bocelli, but at least he can speak the language he sings in.Anyone with the slightest inclination to hear music would know this for the erstaz rubbish it is. How would anyone know if this guy can sing from the sorry example hereAVOID"
1,Unintelligible in 4 languages,"This album includes songs in English, Spanish, Italian and French. No matter the language, the lyrics are gibberish. One line just about caused to me to crash my car ... something about ""love is more than pain and deceit"". In what bizarro land does love equal deceit?To bad this kid doesn't get a better lyricist or sing old standards or something because this material rots."
1,Another?,"Another one of these guys?Another tenor broadway type guy I don't mean to sterotype ,but come on when are you people going to learn that these kind of easy listening DWOBS and yes I said DWOBS are going to take over the airwaves and then we will be living in Babylon5.Don't buy this junk I've heard it just to show that I can be open minded and now I know that when this trash comes on the radio to close my mind."
1,The Closer,"Out of 13 tracks there is only one song on the cd I recognized, you raise me up. He needs to come out with a greatest hits cd."
1,"Good Looks, But That Is All.","Josh Groban is nothing but Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion rolled into one. He looks like he belongs in a Gap commercial.There is some psychology happening here. Since Mr. Groban has a certain look, people will say that he has an excellent voice and that his singing is heartfelt. If he didn't have ""the look"", then he'd be seen for what he is, namely a Bocelli clone with no true creativity or musical talent.Come on, people! Wise up, huh?"
1,not good,"A voice with very little substance. I agree with all the others who question why is he so popular. Obviously by all the comments, there is a huge audience for this kind of stuff."
1,A beautiful voice wasted on this album,"A big disappointment!. This album is mostly Italian love songs (I guess that's what they are)and don't mean anything to this listener. He has a beautiful voice but it's wasted on this album. There are dozens of beautiful songs that would be even more beautiful if he preformed them instead of these rather abscure tunes. I'm talking about songs that were on his first album like ""Vincent"", ""Jesu, joy of mans desiring"", ""The Prayer"". I wasted my money on this album!!"
1,Son of a... *mumble mumble*,"So I'm not the sort of person qualified to review this pile of... anyways, I'm getting off track. I only listened to five minutes of this and shut it off in pure embarrasment. I hope no one heard me listening to it, or I'd have to let them beat me with a rake. As for the CD. It's a pure exercise in sucking out any true emotion out of music, smearing it with cheez, then overprocessing it's corpse until it's just a metallically rendered monument to exactly WHY the music industry will eat itself.There was a reason this music became out of style in the first place. This isn't music. I don't know what this is. If you make crap smell like roses, it's still crap. Do yourself a favor, pick up music with some soul in it. You'll thank yourself later. Cheers."
1,What did I buy?,"I bought ""Closer"" by Josh Groban hoping to hear the songs that are listed on the CD. I don't know what the problem is, but all this CD will do is allow me to join his fan club. If you don't want to experience world class frustration you best buy and test this album at your local store."
5,Stunning!,"I bought this album on a whim. Glad I did! A truely remarkable album. The voice of Josh Groban does lack in base, but it does not detract from a stunningly beautiful album. He sings in French and English, but you hardly even notice. His voice is remarkable powerful and moving. A MUST HAVE for anyone's CD collection!"
5,Excellence on the Pop charts?,"Amazing talent. May he have a long career. Thank you, David Foster, for finding and developing talent and putting something in the record store that will stand up over time."
5,Truly Amazing,"Josh Groban is literally THE BEST singer that I have ever heard. He has such an amazing voice that makes you just go ""wow!"". I really like this album because Josh sings in a veriaty of languages: French, Latin, Spanish, Italian, English.... The entire CD is amazing but my top picks for songs would have to Oceano, My Confession, When you say you love me, Remember when it rained, Hymne a l'amour, You raise me up, and Never let go. So go out there and buy Josh Groban's CD closer, you won't regret it!"
5,CLOSER-JOSH GROBIN,THIS YOUNG MAN HAS A VOICE EQUAL TO ANDREA BOCELLI AND IS A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR YOUNG SINGERS TODAY.
5,Truly Amazing!!!,"Josh has once again managed to mesmerize me with his beautiful, powerful voice. Every song on this album is simply wonderful. When I first heard ""You Raise Me Up"" I got goose bumps, and immediately went out and bought the CD. Then I heard ""Remember When It Rained"". I honestly went to a place that was so peaceful and beautiful. I was that captivated. What a beatiful song, what a powerful voice. A true talent.This CD surpasses the first. Great job Josh. Great job."
5,It doesn't get any better...yet!,"I have been a Groban fan since I saw his performance of ""To Where You Are"" on Ally McBeal. I went out and immediately bought the fist album, loved it and purchaced the In Concert DVD/CD when it became available.When I found out that the second album, ""Closer"" was due for release I marked my calendar! I WAS NOT disappointed. Groban's second effort has everything that the first album had and more. I really can't say that I have any particular favorite songs, because the whole album is incredible.Groban's voice is excellent at portraying a vast array of emotion in this album. The songs ""When You Say You Love Me"" and ""Broken Vow"" are of particular note, while ""Never Let Go"" gives Josh a nudge in a new direction, which shows wonderful artistic growth. All I can say is, BUY THE ALBUM, listen to it and prepare for something simply amazing...Trust me it doesn't get any better than this...until the third album of course!"
5,AWESOME!!,"Josh Groban's Closer CD has some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard, it is moving and the words are great!"
4,Experimental sax over soundscapes,"Jaxon's is a great sax maestro. One of the greatest in the prog rock scene of the seventies. Personally i love Jaxon's playing with Van der graaf generator, whose recordings i highly recommend to progressive rock fans. 5 stars music.On this cd you will find a few sax jammy songs, but mostly experimental sax, not necessarily jazzy. Not properly songs but sounscapes instead. VDGG fans will like it. Sax lovers will like it too."
4,"""Acid Jazz"" as in ACID (LSD-25)","Well, first of all, let's understand that Trane was tripping regularly in '65 and '66, reading The Tibetan Book of The Dead, reading Hindu and Zen Buddhist books and also reading Indian mystics...I forget the names off hand.So, he and his band went to Seattle and recorded this at the Penthouse and then the next day they went up to Lynnwood, WA and recorded ""OM"".It's really hard to call this ""Jazz"". It's just free/energy music with little structure, and most listeners will have absolutely no clue how to hear this.I give it 4 stars for the intensity and the energy but docked 1 star for the indulgence. The 60's ""New Thing"" was pretty crazy sometimes and people started tuning out Jazz because they simply couldn't ""grok"" this stuff. So, now, we have Jazz comprising less than 1% of all music recorded. I love Trane and Ornette and Cecil, but, truthfully, they helped put Jazz into the museum, if you know what I mean..."
5,Sonic Textures,"THis album is a prime example of free jazz. More textural than Coltrane's ""Ascension"" with the many bellowing horns. The presence of more of a soundscape, and layering is involved that creates spontaneous visual imagery.If you dig ""Ascension,"" ""Kulu Se Mama,"" or ""Om"" and the like, this is a treat.Not for the weak at heart."
4,One of his free jazz albums that grew on me.,When I first heard this album I thought it was a waste of money. I tried to listen to it a lot more times but I didn't like it. Finally I just listened to it and liked it. The only song I didn't like was cosmos that is too wild for me to listen to. This album was recorded during Coltrane's stay in the west coast where he recorded Kulu Se Mama. This was also the first live album with the Coltrane-Sanders saxophone duo. This was also the first live album where coltrane started exploring with bigger groups and doubling up on basses and drums. I still say don't buy this album yet if you don't a good ear for music because you will think it's bad when it's not at all.
3,Wha'?,"My God. I liked the Olatunji concert, but there are limits to even my liberal definition of ""music"". Cosmos is a nonsensical catfight. Afro-Blue begins nicely with a 4/4 version of the theme, but where does Trane go after the first fifty seconds? Pharoah Sanders takes over in a truly crude and pretentious display of quacks and farting noises.I havent listened to Evolution, but I understand it is even harder on the ears than Cosmos.The only thing I liked on this album was Body and Soul, in a wild version that would have given Coleman Hawkins peptic ulcers. I must admit I also liked Out of this World. Three stars out of five."
5,Live in Seattle: It will blow your mind,"I first heard this music in 1971 when I was 15 years old, in junior high school. It shook me then and it shakes me still. Coltrane blows with such ferocity, yet beauty you literally can't believe your ears. Pharoah leaves the planet. Not for the light-hearted. Get ready for the real trip. Free-jazz Coltrane style."
5,Body and Soul/Out of This World,The two standards on this set have Coltrane playing that is simply shocking and shockingly beautiful. Outstanding Garrison and Jones.
3,Technical Noise,"_Live in Seattle_ does have a beauty that seems other-worldly, but I would also add that this is not a CD to play on most occasions. Nothing against Coltrane's free-jazz era, _Live in Japan_ is one of my favorite 'Trane albums, but this CD has moments that are so excruciating that they seem to be noise for the sake of noise. One can refute me, but I think Coltrane was losing some of his vision by this stage in his career. _Live in Japan_ has an undergirding beneath the noise that still suggests a yearning for the infinite and a yearning to keep the noise somewhat musical. The musicality has been forsaken to a large extent on _Live at Seattle_. There are strengths in evidence here--as there are on every project 'Trane ever participated in--but they are not of the same magnitude as they are on his truly classic CDs such as _A Love Supreme_ and _Live at Birdland_. Of interest only to the most avid of Coltrane lovers."
3,Description,"""Peru's a fascinating country, but it hasn't yet acquired the reputation of being a playground for popsies,"" Ross Henderson told Joby Lester sarcastically.Of course, he had mistaken her for her rich butterfly cousin Jose - another Josephine Lester - but that didn't stop Joby taking an instant dislike to him.And then Jose talked her into changing places with her in real earnest."
5,"Handy, well made",I use these to move boat lifts so they are exposed to grime and moisture EVERY USE and not treated with much care. I dry them out before storage and lube the mechanism with WD40 every 3rd or 4th use. They work great and hold up well to our abuse!
4,Purchased for my grown son,My grown son loves everything Motley Crue and was pleasantly surprised at this gift that he did not know was available. Two points for me!
4,Vintage L'Amour I waited a long time for this.,I have read most of the western fiction written by Louis L'Amour and found this collection of short stories intriguing. There is a diverse mixture of characters & scenes and you want to just finish a story as soon as you start it. I look forward to reading the other new collections of his works.
3,Warren's review of very good short stories.,These stories took me back a ways. Each is in the same entertainment as the rest of Mr. Lamour's best. I enjoyed the stories as much as the longer novels.Wish I had had my Kindle before getting the book.Warren
3,NO captions or subtitles???!!!,"I can't find captions or subtitles anywhere on this DVD, and I've looked a number of times. There's no caption symbol or mention of them on the DVD cover, so I can only assume they're just not there. This is a particular shame given that the DVD is otherwise so excellent, and this is inexcusable in this day and age. I would give the content 5 stars, but I have to mark my rating down to 3 for this apparent omission.On a different note, I also wish the DVD came with an update on the search for the minisubs, which I find intriguing. The inside view of the Arizona was amazing, with the officer's desk, papers and items still perfectly in place, was striking."
3,Dr. Bob is starting to run out of steam,"I avidly follow Dr. Ballard's expeditions, and usually buy anything related to his work, but this one falls a bit short. Yes, it goes into personal recollections of the attack, yes, he looks for underwater wreckage, and yes, there is some great footage of the Arizona.But....There is altogether too much footage of ROV's being lowered into the water, a very high level background on the attack, that doesn't even talk about each of the midget subs involved, and a very short intro into the sub he's looking for.There is much more to find Dr. Ballard, How about clearing up the Fuso/Yamashiro questions?, or the Shoho and Lexington? Or even another try for the Japanese carriers off of Midway."
4,The Oregon Trail: Sketches of prairie and Rocky-Mountain life.,"There are lots of facts and exciting parts in the this book. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the best book I've read about the Oregon Trail. Lots of interesting detail."
3,I'm addicted to stories like this,I love to read about the daily living of people in history. I don't know what it is that drags me to it every single time. I liked this story alot.
4,Very Good First Person History,"This is a very good first person account of a horseback trip by two friends, going west from St. Louis into the frontier. The writing style is very good. You get an idea of distances travelled, the forts they traveled to, Indian life, and what it was like when people were moving into Indian territory. The author is unsympathetic when describing his hunting exploits of killing more buffalo than necessary for sustenance as they only use the best cuts of the cows."
5,"A wonderful alphabet book, timeless quality","This book is a must read for any young child- even an infant. The black and white pencil drawings are intricate and soft, and though my son is older, he was drawn right into the illustrations. The copy that we checked out came with an audiotape, with accompanying music which is printed in the book on the last page, with the words. The book itself it very rhythmical and lends itself to be sung by a child even without the music. I found a few grammatical (punctuation) errors (Scholastic 1990 edition), which tripped me up as I read along, but not having another printing to compare to, I didn't let that determine the star quality of this book. I can almost remember it being read to me as a child, and I would read it to anyone who would sit and listen."
1,Fits but doesn't work right.,"The mirror fits on the car perfectly, but the mirror itself doesn't tilt up enough, the only thing i see out of my mirror is the road. The item seems to be made a good bit cheaper and doesn't even come close to OEM."
2,Smoldering Embers in the Kitchen,"I spent the summer up in Cape Breton and when I saw that this CD had come out at the same time I jumped on the chance to buy it.I was looking for a great sound-track CD to the trip home but I was left high and dry. About less than half of the tracks herehave some real spirit and fire but the rest fall flat and rely too heavily on the stereotypical airy, flowy, spiritually slow,mournful celtic airs. There's certainly a time and a place for that... just not on an album called FIRE in the Kitchen showinga spirited kitchen party on the cover. The decent tracks on here are from Leahy, La Bottine Souriant, Ashley MacIsaac (thoughnot as ""firey"" as he usually is) Great Big Sea (before they went mainstream pop) and Natalie MacMaster. Best just to downloadthose tunes individually unless you're a big fan of the Celtic Women series on PBS... then you'll probably LOVE this."
5,Pure foot-stompin' pleasure!,"Definite 5-star album with wonderful variety, beautiful vocals (esp. cut no. 12), and pure soul. If you're having a down day, pop it in the cd player and it's sure to put a smile on your face. And if you're already having a fantastic day, hold on to your seat!"
4,Great style for a guy's room,The style is great for a guy's room. Now we need to get a bed skirt and curtains to pull the style of the room together. The fabric could be just a little bit softer.
4,Somewhere I'll Find You is a 'rare find'!,"Totally engrossing. A 'one sititng' read. Normally, I'm a historical romance reader, however, this one by Lisa Kleypas had me captivated. Though totally not original, the writer keeps the readers engrossed with the pain, anguish and resentment the characters feel for their situation. However, both are strong willed, independent, and determined to battle to the end to have their way, in other words, a typical romance novel written well enough to be 'oh so entertaining'. If you're a thespian, you'll love 'Somewhere I'll find you', if you're a hopeless romantic, you'll love 'Somewhere I'll Find You', and if you're a historical buff like myself, read and enjoy it for the change and variety!"
3,"Kept reading, but left disappointed","This story had the potential to be really great. Instead it moved very quickly through the plot line, with no real depth or character traits. I usually LOVE Lisa Kleypas books, but I would not put this on my re-read list. On numerous occasions as I was reading, I found myself going back through the story to find out how the characters had found themselves at a certain point. It really lacked clarity."
2,Not Good,"I didn't care for this book at all... the writing was poor, the characters were not well developed at all. It was SO predictable, you can see the scene coming a mile away. Again, the character development was very poor. Also, the writing was too modern for the time period...if you removed the references to oil lamps and horses and carriages, this could have been a contemporary romance. Just finished reading the Outlander Series, and this doesn't even come within the same League."
4,A Good Read,I enjoyed this book. The heroine was strong and knew her mind. The hero was strong but not afraid to show his soft side. It was nice to see the main characters fall in love slowly and take their time in developing a stronger relationship.
2,Ugh,"I was immensely disappointed. This could have been so much better... Damon was an obsessive, controlling, stalking idiot. I did not want the heroine to be with him in the end... he was scary! She should have married Logan! And Logan was interesting--business and money. I'm sure the sequel is more interesting than this. Why did she keep coming back to him? Why do all historical romances have to be based on sex? Why do all heroines have to give in? And why do they all have to be beautiful goddess, their lovers gorgeous, perfect gods? But Damon wasn't perfect--he was obsessive. If this were a contemporary romance, he'd be put in jail!"
4,First romance book,"I really enjoyed this book! It is my first romance book, it's romantic, dramatic, and just a good book in general. It's kinda like reading a soap opera! I can't wait to read other great romance books by Lisa Kleypas."
2,Loved the Concept,"I loved the concept of an arranged child marriage where they both went their separate ways. But this story fell short for me. Considering once they discovered they liked each other and had passion, why did she keep denying it? Kind of found her constant denial irritating. Considering she was a blue-blooded female, I can't image her preferring the life in the theater to a handsome rich husband and children. Story seemed to drag on and on about people, places and things that were of no interest to the story. Skip it."
3,LK has grown alot since this one....,"Well, I can really tell how much Lisa Kleypas has grown as an author. This book was put out in 1996 & it doesn't compare with her more recent novels. I do believe that alot of historical romance readers would like it, but it just didn't thrill me. As usual, LK wrote an original storyline; I really enjoyed reading about the lives of thespians. As in her others novels, LK made the characters come to life for me. There were a number of secondary characters that really added to the story & the hero & heroine were good people..... but it just took sooooooo long for them to come to grips with what each other wanted & needed - it dragged on way too long. I did major skimming in this one. Also, the love scenes were not near as sweet & sensual as LK's newer releases. However, I've read enough wonderful LK books that I will definitely stay a loyal fan of hers."
2,What a disappointment!!!!!,"I am an avid fan of Lisa Kleypas...I will buy just about anything with her name on it that I can get my hands on....so when I purchased ""Somewhere I'll Find You"", I was very eager to get started on it..... I have this thing where I can't leave a book until I've finished it...believe me..I tried, but I couldn't do it...to put it bluntly, this book was awful. The story dragged on and on...and the characters were not at all likeable...it got to the point where I didnt even care what happened to them..I just wanted it to end..I adore Ms. Kleypas, but ""Somewhere I'll Find You"" is definitely NOT a story that I would recommend."
3,"Okay book, not as good as some of her others","This book was okay, but not as good as her other books. I'm having a hard time putting a finger on exactly what I didn't like about this books so I don't think its that I disliked anything about it. It's just that there were other books by Ms. Kleypas that I have enjoyed so much more. I just wasn't as drawn into this story as I have been by some of her other books."
2,A definite turkey,"I usually love Kleypas, but this novel was a big disappointment (the sequel, Because You're Mine, is not much better). The writing is bland, and Kleypas utilizes too many silly plot devices and romance cliches in the story. Overall, a very boring and occasionally irritating book. She has done much better!"
2,"""Somewhere I'll Find You""","I have never received this product; I have contacted the vendor and keep getting messages referring to the OTHER book I ordered, ""Midnight Angel"", which was received in a timely manner. I realize using preprinted messages saves the vendor time, but I would appreciate a more personal involvement when there is an unhappy customer, which I am! I received an e-mail telling me there was a credit applied to my account for the book I did not receive, then 20 minutes later received ANOTHER e-mail telling me the book in question had shipped! I STILL have not received the book or any further communication."
2,One of those misses...,"Irritating plot, irritating characters. Who really believes they've married unseen, she runs away but not before they share a passionate kiss, of course unknowing that they were married and then by chance meet again years later and are drawn to each other, heroin in denial and hero leaded by his lust...England must be a small world..and yet no one could find the missing bride until just then. Damon ""Savage""(is that really his last name*rolling eyes*) was your typical, over possesive alpha male with no depth that I'm honestly getting tired of reading about over and over again. I've read some really good Lisa Kleypas books and loved them, this one was just not for me."
