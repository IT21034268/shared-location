1,Should come with a pair of scissors,"I have owned this product for two years and it never fails to irritate. Not only does it waste Brother's ridiculously expensive tape, but it also fails to automatically trim labels symmetrically on both sides. This means the user has to MANUALLY TRIM at least one side with a pair of scissors to center the text neatly on the label. Oh, and while I'm on the subject of the text . . . It's a pixelated, utilitarian sans serif stretched to awkward proportions by some of the various ""size"" settings on the machine. If you're considering this product, I would seriously recommend one of those old-fashioned embossing labelers instead."
5,A Mom,"LOVE IT!!!!Not only has it come in handy for labeling my son's Lego containers but I use it in the Kitchen. And since my aunt has moved into an assisted living situation, I have used it more that I thought I would."
1,"Wastes Tape, wastes tape, wastes tape!",This thing wastes so much tape it is ridiculous. Don't buy this or you'll be kicking yourself after you realize how much tape it wastes and the price of the tape.
2,Poor quality control,"The machine works great when it works. Unfortunately, I have had two models that needed repair - sigh. The first time the print head died. The second time the cutter was defective. Brother needs to a better job on their quality control. Also, I agree with others about too much wasted tape - a real scam since you need their expensive tapes."
3,The tape cassette gets messed up and can't be fixed.,"I really loved this machine as stated in some other reviews. It was so great for so many labeling uses. However, at some point it started to eat the tape coming out of the cassette. Once it starts to do that to a cassette, there is no repair to it; the cassette is completely unusable. I have tried everything I can think of to fix cassettes that have started to do this. As so many have stated, the tape cassettes are really expensive. I have had this machine eat really new cassettes that I have just started to use, and at more than $20 per casette, that is way unacceptable. This is actually the SECOND machine of these that I have bought that has done this. I am going to ditch both of them and look for one by another maker."
4,Great Self-help book,"I've read your book and found it very helpful, especially the part dealing with housekeepers."
1,Inspector Lynley Mysteries Set 2,"I've seen the entire Inspector Lynley Mysteries series, have enjoy them all, and am a collector of the DVDs. The website advertises Set 2 as widescreen, but after receiving (and returning) the full-screen version of it in two separate orders, I've concluded that Amazon does not have the widescreen version afterall. A bit of a disappointment, and a hassle as well."
5,Another series hit! Intelligent dialogue and scenic vistas.,"I love the series and truly enjoyed every episode, which is why I ordered the entire series. I highly recommend the series for any fan of mysteries, especially British ones. Intelligent dialogue, scenic locations and the developing respect and admiration between the two lead characters make this a show worth viewing.The four episodes contain a mix of darkness and wry humor.Series 2 does an excellent job of continuing where Series 1 ended. It's been said that the book series author wasn't particularly pleased with the casting Sharon Small. I haven't read the books yet, but I find Small to have been an excellent choice.Its nice to see that the British are just as conniving, crooked, selfless and rotten as their friends across the pond, more so in all the episodes of the series."
4,DVD's vs BOOKS,"I've read all of the Inspector Lynley books. These DVD's do come close to doing the books justice; however, some of the suspense is passed over because of time. Nevertheless, I think the stories run relatively true.In the beginning, I didn't like the two people playing Lynley and Chevers, but I have grown used to them. The woman playing Helen, Lynley's love interest, is perfect for her part."
4,Excellent for the price,"I searched around for a long time before deciding to purchase this TV. The TV was easy to set up, providing as many different hookups as i needed. It looked allright with my PS2, and absolutly amazing while playing the PS3. Blue Ray discs look excellent on this TV. Standard definition TV doesn't look that great, but that's to be expected with HDTV's. Television in High def. looks pretty good, but not as great as I had expected. I highly reccommed this TV, the price is just so amazingly low compared to other similar models."
4,Highly recommended,"I bought this in September, and have been too busy enjoying it to submit a feedback. :-)To me this HDTV is a great balance of cost, size, and features. I use it for over-the-air broadcast HD programs, DVDs (with upconvert DVD player via HDMI), and XBox 360 games. All work great with it."
4,Excellent Television,"I've owned this TV now for about 4 months and I still think it was the best deal I could find anywhere for the quality product I received. Samsung DLP technology is just so much cleaner than the sony's I looked at. I got the TV for around 1,150 shipped to my door after I had some shipping issues with the freight service, but Amazon was great and gave me a discount because of the problems - customer service was very helpful. As for the picture of this TV it's truly amazing. I have yet to get an upconvert or blu-ray/hd-dvd player, but I do have HDTV DVR cable connected VIA HDMI cable and it is amazing in 1080p. the resolution is so crisp I hate watching regular TV now. I highly reccomend the 46"" DLP if you're looking for an affordable HDTV, but you don't want to spend the money yet on a plasma or LCD. Sofar the lamp life has been great, I imagine I will be replacing it in the next couple years because we are watching movies and recorded shows ALL THE TIME we love it so much."
5,"Samsung 46"" Great Quality - Great Price","Purchased in August '06 and shipment via Eagle was flawless. Arrived in about 10 days and shipper delivered, unpacked the TV and took away all the packing materials. Set up was easy. The TV is surprisingly light weight. We bought the companion stand for the unit and the two go together well. The stand is obviously designed for this unit.Picture quality is excellent (its the mirrors!). Our son is jealous and much prefers the picture on our Samsung to the picture quality on his 3 year old Sony rear projection HDTV. I have yet to see a better price for this TV anywhere else."
1,Still Not Working,"So far I do not have a working TV. I ordered it almost a month ago. It never worked out of the box and the first available date for a ""authorized"" dealer to come service it is another two weeks away. That means it will be close to two months that I have waited to watch my (hopefully) working TV. Never again!"
1,TV came damaged,I got my TV from Electronics Expo (abstain from doing business with these guys) and it came with four smudges. They are not willing to help me solve the problem.
3,Real Bad delivery service,"Not a review on the item. Its a review on Amazon delivery service.Its the worst delivery service that I have encountered. I had to call three diffrent parties to track where the TV is, and still it was late from the latest date communicated by Amazon. They don't give you a tracking number. Don;t expect your TV in any less than 10 days when you buy from Amazon."
3,Great Buy,"It is a great buy, 46 Samsung DLP for less than $1,100. However beware if you order this from Amazon. Their shipping information is inaccurate and could be considered fradulant. I ordered this item from Amazon and was told it would be delivered between December 19-22. When I received the shipping confirmation, they changed the delivery date to January 3. While I protested that they had broken our purchase agreement, they have yet to change their delivery date to what was agreed upon. I would recommend you pay more and buy from a local or other online vendor. It would appear that Amazon can not be trusted."
4,Seem good so far...,"I have no problem with this TV from Amazon. Eagle called me 4 days ahead of the estimated delivery date and say that it could be delivered the following day. With free shipping I did not expect white glove delivery, so the single delivery guy just place it at the spot I want and unboxed it. There was not any damage to the box, so the guy did not turn it on before leaving. He did not take away the box, but thats ok I can just cut it up myself and place it in the recycle bin. The tv is still working fine. Free HDTV from the major networks and PBS comes in very nice. Football and nature shows are awesome when broadcasted in HD signal. Now i am just waiting for my up-converting DVD player to arrive.... Four stars because I just got it, if no problems in the coming year it would receive 5."
2,The shipping is too slow,"I just checked my order n eagle gl tracking system, I found my order had been moved around 100 miles for 10 days. Average 10 miles a day."
3,"TV is pretty good, but the Shipping company isn't","It's not too late for the delivery. However, the shipping company EGL tried to push me to sign just ONE minute after they came into the hourse and wouldn't give me any time to check. Apparently there are some minor problems on the TV's screen, but I cannot figure it out. It's kind of ribble shaped things on the screen even when it's turned off. When the TV is turned on, it disappears, but you can still see it if the background color is dark. I don't know if will cause a big issue later, but for the time beging, I'll try to tolerate it.DO NOT GET RUSHED just because the delivery man pushes you too much. They do not care about Amazon's customer. Be wise to make sure the TV is functional. Check the TV when it's off and on. DO NOT SIGN anything unless you feel comfortable. Once they're gone, it's yours, either good or bad.Based on the bad experience with the shipping company and the minor problems on my TV, I gave 3 stars."
5,THIS TV WILL BLOW YOUR MIND,"If you are in the market for a TV and dont need to hang it on the wall...buy this Samsung 46"" DLP IMMEDIATELY!!! Picture quality is comparable if not better than the LCD/Plasma displays I've seen. Esp. the lower end models. I have this set hooked up VIA HDMI to my Cablevision box and even standard definition channels are great. HD is stunning! I cant leave my living room. BEST OF ALL...the price. Insane deal, you wont find it for under a thousand anywhere but right here. I ordered the TV Sunday January 7th..it arrived today (Jan. 11th) at 10am. and this shipping was free! you have to be kidding!..this is an incredible deal. I am 110% satisfied."
4,Good TV with a great price,"I kept my eye on this TV for a while, read many reviews, and Amazon definitely has the best price with free shipping. The shipping from Eagle took about 7 business days, which was not that important to me, and was delivered in perfect condition directly to the TV stand.The picture is great. I could not justify the 1080p models by Samsung (which look amazing), so I went with the lower priced 720p native display model. It's way better than what I am used to and good enough for me.Check out AVSFORUM for this TV where there are many advanced users with info on custom settings for a perfect picture. That has been very helpful.All together a good TV for the price. So far I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Its Very good......but not the BEST,"Hi,PROS :- VERY LIGHT WEIGHT , SLEEK LOOKS , GOOD POICTURE QUALITY , DECENT SOUND , 2 HDMI I/P , USB input.CONS :- The Centre of the screen shows BULB SPOT. There is a wierd yellow patch at the cetnre of the screen. When the TV turns ON , its not visible, but its certainly visible if the screen has a LOT of Black color . It Irritates me a quite a bit. Had it not been for this wierd Spot, i would have given this TV 5 starts. I got it for 1299 $ so am quite happy with the price ."
2,Worst Warranty Service I have ever experienced,This TV has a great picture and would be a 5 star rating if it had acceptablewarranty service. I bought this TV in December and it worked great for about a month. The cooling fan for the bulb started malfunctioning and would only allow the TV to work for a few minutes before shutting it down. I reported the problem to Samsung and have waited for three weeks with no resolution. They say the reason for the delay is the lack of a local authorized repair center to perform the in-home repair. I have no idea of how much longer I will have to wait before I get my TV replaced or repaired.I cannot recommend Samsung because of their poor warranty service....buy a Sony!!!
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"Initially hesitant about making such a large purchase online, I did so anyway based on much of the glaring feedback I read. What a mistake! The delivery truck broke down so I received the TV later than promised. The delivery guy basically ran out of the door after bringing the TV in the house and told me if I had any problems to call Amazon. Hooked the TV up and realized why I should not have bought this thing online. The picture is terrible! Bought all the upgraded cables etc and still no difference.Attempted to return the TV and Amazon told me they don't take TV's over 27 inches back. Learned a hard lesson. Will never make a large purchase online or with Amazon again."
1,Delivery,I don't know how I'll like the TV. As I went through the order forms it said that I was supposed to receive it in 6 t 8 days. After I ordered it the e mail I got said it would be at least 25 days. That's wrong for Amazon to do that to someone.
1,It should have lasted longer,"I purchased the Samsung HL4666W Model on June 24, 2006. I am dismayed that it is already broken, does not turn on. I checked and since I did not buy an extended warranty I had to contact the manufacturer who referred me to a television repair store that will repair it and I will have to pay a minimum of $65 for an estimate. I would expect a television that I paid $1400 for to last longer than 18 months or for Amazon to offer some assurance that it would last. If I had it to do over again I would go to Circuit City.jane"
5,Excellent DLP TV,"You can't beet this TV for the price. TV was delivered 7 days from order. Excellent picture quality. I use mine with DirecTV HD, a standard DVD player, and a Blueray DVD player. Two friends have also purchased this TV after they saw mine!"
3,Decent TV but...,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I received my tv 2 days before the estimated date. Reading about how bad egl handles packages, I patiently waited outside for the tv to arrive. And of course the shipping guys were in a hurry to leave. They wanted me to sign right away before the tv was even unloaded. I told them ""No!"" and that I would to need to inspect the tv before signing. They said ok, but in a way like they were irritated. I inspected the tv and everything was ok.I fine tuned everything and picture is fantastic. Regular tv signals are alright. But while I was watching a dvd, the tv turned off all of a sudden and a burning smell started coming from it. I quickly unplugged it and waited a few minutes before turning it back on. The tv still worked, but now the Audio out doesn't work. I will be calling samsung to see if it can get fixed.Overall the tv is great."
4,An interesting memoir,"This is a remarkable account of a Polish Jew's escape from the Nazis and his subsequent wartime service in the Red Army. Mr. Temkin's writing is rarely emotional, never vengeful, which may seem somewhat incongruous with the level of the tragedy he experienced. His entire family perished, after all; he barely escaped. And he encountered physical hardship and anti-Semitism in Russia. But he gives a straight-forward account of the Holocaust in Poland, his rather extraordinary rise in rank in the Soviet Army, and his ""just war"" -- his personal battle against Fascism. Credit belongs to Mr. Temkin's family for persuading him to share his very interesting memoir."
4,Thank you Mr. Temkin,"A very gripping book, I believe that it is an important historical document. In my eyes Mr. Temkin is a true hero, a lucky survivor, and we are blessed that he has shared a part of his life with all of us."
3,Good first person account of the Soviet WWII,"The book is a first person account from a non-Western perspective of WWII. I think one of the book's most interesting aspects is that it was written from the Soviet side, which I found very difficult to find (most eye witness books of WWII, published in English, are by Germans). The book is written in a simple style (you can see the author is not a professional novel writer) and is focussed on a very narrow window of the war, i.e. the window he saw. In that window though, some very interesting facts are relayed: treatment of Jews by the Germans and their allies, treatment of Germans and their allies by the Russians, etc. The other fact Temkin portrays very well is the attitude and atmosphere pervailing in the Russian army. Overall, the book can get trivial at times, but I would reccommend it to a WWII reader."
3,Interesting first person account.,"I always enjoy reading first person accounts. This book was fair and was worth reading because of the few first person accounts of WWII from the Russian perspective. I found it fascinating that the author and his peers could readily see the evil in Nazism but so quickly overlook the crimes and brutality of Stalin's Russia. Another fascinating aspect was to see how backwards and brutal the soviet army was at that time (both to the enemy and its own people), yet it's soldiers still fought on with conviction."
5,An entertaining Western book!,"I enjoyed reading Jim Ugly.This exciting book is about 12 year old, his dog, and their search for Jake's father,who everybody else thinks is dead. As they search, they make new friends, and find new enemies. With all of the dangers they face as they travel alone, will they find Jake's Father? Is Jake's father even alive? You can find out as you read this excellent book!"
5,Interesting and fun book!,"This book was very good for many reasons, beacuase it's funny and very interesting. It's about a boy that is searching for his father that is believed to be dead who was really hidding becuase some people wanted some dimonds that he had found, that he had already got rid of by feeding them to some chickens. It's a great book and I highly recomend it."
2,little girl junk,I purchased this movie thinking it was going to some very out there type of a movie and it definitely was not. First of all it was black and white (advertisement didnt say that) and secondly this definitely isnt much of an out there movie. You dont see anything in this film and the narration could have done without.
5,Good Story,"Another great NOVA presentation. I've seen this a number of times (on TV and DVD) and, still, I'm not tired of it. I always wonder why NOVA has such good productions and I think I know why: it's because they present and EXPLAIN a lot of information in detail - they're complex which makes it interesting - and they complement the complexity by presenting the information as a story (it's not just facts presented - anybody can throw out facts). The discovery of this mummy is told from beginning to end in detail by a number of egyptologists - the narrator is just there to tie things together. This is a well-facused documentary on a particular pharaoh told in great detail as a story."
1,Do not buy this fan!,"This fan was shipped to me in the original box with tape all over. It was obviously not well packed, and as a result a few of the plastic parts were cracked. The fan just looks like it's made cheaply. Do not buy!"
5,An outstanding introduction to the father of Bluegrass Music,"This is a generously programmed, slam-bang collection of the best songs recorded by Bill Monroe and his band (in its various early incarnations) on the Decca/MCA label. With 22-tracks total, this is perhaps the ideal album to pick up if you only want to get a single disc of Monroe's work... and it's all really great stuff. Kudos to MCA/Universal for doing such a good job on this well-made, thoughtful reissue!Word to the wise: Although this best-of is really good, keep in mind that all the songs on here are *also* included on the equally fab 50 track, 2-CD ""Anthology"" collection, which cam out a year later, in 2003. Either way you go, though, this stuff is the very definition of ""high lonesome,"" super-authentic bluegrass music. Highly recommended!!"
5,Great Little Book,Great little book. This is a re-edit and reads even better than the original. A definite collectible for youth novels. It would make an entertaining family film.
4,A Riveting Read,I couldn't put the book down. I read it out loud to some kids in the neighborhood and they liked it a whole lot.
4,Pengey and Friends,"My parents bought this book, ""The Many Adventures of Pengey Penguin"", for me when the author came to visit. At first, I thought it would be too young for me, but I said I would read it to my younger brother and sister. I ended up really enjoying this book. I'm 12 years old this year, and I like Penguins and travel. I think that's why I liked the book. The main character, Pengey, travels from Antarctica to New York and makes stops at two other countries, so it was fun to find the places on the map and show my younger brother and sister where he went. I've been to New York too. I also like his two best friends and their friendship and how they get into trouble and have to get out again. It was also exciting."
3,Cute Kids Book,"Pengey is a very young penguin who was orphaned and left on his own at a very early age. His will to survive takes Pengey away from the only home and community he's ever known into the crazy world of humans.Courage, perseverance and, yes, curiosity are just some of the things that help Pengey - and get him into trouble.Hott ReviewA terrific bedtime story! This is one of those books that are wonderful to read a chapter or two every night at bedtime with our children. I adored the little guy and the friends he makes along the way."
5,"Penguins, Parrots and Puffins! Oh My!","This is a delightful book!! I have to say that adults and children alike will enjoy reading Pengey's Story. This little penguin meets many fascinating characters, both animal and human, as he travels from Antarctica to New York City. John Burns, the author, really gives voice to the characters and writes a story that is at once touching and action packed. Adults will not be bored! Children will be enthralled!"
5,A Treasure!,"This book was a find. Both the kids and myself enjoyed Pengey Penguin's MANY adventures. It is a fun and engaging story - well written by the author, John Burns. Any realtion to Robert Burns-mmm!? Anyways - you gotta love Pengey's tenacity and his gentle soul. This one is a goody."
3,Good knife but lousy pouch,"The free pouch is too lousy.Doesn't fit perfectly to the knife and not so durable.The sides of the pouch are just made of elastic(Plus 7 Usd more you have to pay for this pouch is definitely not worth it,it is not really as FREE as said.)I strongly recommend you to get only the knife and find other proper pouch.Hope this help.The track-package funtion didn't work well,so it was hard to track my order."
4,"Nice knife, bad pouch","I have had a Swiss Army knife for a very long time, I lost it unfortunately and bought this new one. I am enjoying it as I did with the first one I had, the quality of the steel and the tools is unsurpassable.Anyway, the pouch that comes with this offer does very little in terms of quality. For the future buyers I suggest getting another pouch separately."
3,"Great knife, bad pouch.","The knife is awesome, However, the included knife does not fit into the included case. It's like it was made for a smaller knife."
4,exelent,good product and covers with my requirements as a customer. I have provided the requested comfort. Thanks for good service
4,I've carried this model for over 20 years!,"I have carried this model of knife in my pocket for over 20 years. I frequently use the knife blade, scissors, bottle opener, flathead screwdriver and philips head screwdriver. From what I can tell, this is the smallest model of swiss army knife that has all of these tools.It's great having a tool that I can use to take apart a computer, and also open a bottle of wine. If I were on the design team, I would drop the small knife blade and magnifying glass, which would make it a little bit slimmer. But I can't complain, this model has served me well.As long as I have carried this model, it has only been damaged once, by somebody who had know idea how to use a corkscrew. Great quality, durability and functionality."
4,SWISS ARMY KNIFE,"I think that the knife looks very nice, and was as I expected from the photo on your site. The case is a nice added feature."
2,case is shoddy,"I was disappointed in this product, which was a gift for an eleven year old boy. The knife was fine but the case was ripped after one day. they used glue instead of stitching which did not hold."
3,Biography does not do poet justice,"I found the biography part more difficult to read than the poems. With the poems, many of them I had heard before. My husband knows many of them and loves to recite them.Burns had a short tumultuous life ended prematurely in part by his own addictions. His life reminds me a bit of Mozart's short but brillant life.The artwork sprinkled throughout the book while beautiful was saddly not well documented. I would really have liked to learn more about the pieces. Who painted or drew them? When were they done? What collection(s) are they part of now?"
3,Mozart:Cosi Fan Tutte ~ Karajan,"This is good music with a good conductor, but I was looking for the full opera, not just excerpts, so I am disappointed. If you want just the sung portions of the opera, this recording is good."
3,Reply for Spencer 2 dope,"Working with these...the 5oo watt is a rating compatability. In other words, rated to 5oo watts. No amplifier included."
1,Bleh,"When this book was first published in the early 1970s Lady Sheba claimed it had been passed on to her from her grandmother. This was not, however, the case. This book is pretty much a sloppy copy of the Alexandrian Book of Shadows. The rituals are pretty much the same as the Alexandrian BOS, not to mention the Laws (nearly identical except for one line--the Alexandrian has 151 lines, Sheba's has 152) but you get the added bonus of spelling and copying errors.I recommend Janet and Stewart Farrar's book ""A Witches' Bible."" Not only does this book have the Gardnerian Book of Shadows (the slightly older cousin to the Alexandrian BOS), but the rituals are much closer to the originals. The Farrars, as well as Doreen Valiente, have great comments to add to the BOS in their book.Lady Sheba's book just doesn't cut it if you are looking for a good ritual book, representation of British Traditional Wicca, or source of info in general. Go for the Farrar's books."
4,This was a very good book with usable guidelines.,"Lady Sheba was the first Witch I know of who was willing to go public with her coven's book of shadows. Some of the contents dated back to the burning times when nothing could be written, all had to be committed to memory by coven members. Parts of the book were very touching for anyone who has been involved in the practice of magicke. Although most practitioners would rather allow their own traditions to evolve naturally, this book gave a good general outline not only of what one coven did on holy days, but also how a book of shadows should be assembeled. It was definitely worth reading and keeping."
3,Its alright,"Ok, this was my first Book of Shadows,and I haven't had many since I'm only 15. This was not the best, but it wasn't bad. I liked it because LS published it even though it made some people angry. Personally, I like Crowley a lot; studying his stuff is really cool, and working with his stuff is great (sometimes it works too well); I would recomend him to anyone who is seriously considering this stuff. Ls's Book of Shadows was great for when I was younger, though. If you are older, besides Crowley I would also recomend The Witch's Bible by Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar. That was really great."
1,money wasting,This book of shadows doesnt deserve its value. It sucks. The rituals found can be gotten from anywhere. and it has some things that didnt convince me. some rituals are stupid too. I dont even recommend u buy it even for $1.
1,Not worth the money,very stupid and nothing spectacular. I dont recommend u buy it even if u get it for $1.
5,Chicken soup the the father's psyche,"As the father of a teen-age girl, this collection of verses contained messages that I have experienced. Dads are important in being there through the hurts, joys, learning experiences and petty traumas that young people go through. Then there is the natural but still disturbing time when you are now a thing to be avoided, as being seen in the company of a parent is a terrible thing, except of course when there is a need for cash.Through it all, I remain stoic in my acceptance of the reality, as I know that I am still her dad and a person that she admires, although it may be years before she does anything that informs me of that fact. This book contains a small amount of chicken soup for the dad's psyche as you wait for that time."
5,Seeds of the Heart is a Growing Experience,"Skillfully written, Seeds of the Heart pulls you in right from the start and keeps you guessing. Another world, another time, another dimension? It doesn't matter, the message transcends time and space. It tells a story that parallels the racial tensions and persecutions our own country has survived, a story that compares a society ruled by the precepts of man to a righteous nation emulating the true principles of Christianity. All of this with a stirring love story, self-less sacrifice, and a surprise ending that will leave you all choked up."
3,Columbus,I bought this CD but it does not seem to be the version played by Capt. Uli. Can anyone tell me what version he uses? Thanks!
2,The best thing in the movie... it's not saying much.,"Christopher Columbus: The Discovery was one of the biggest movie disasters in recent years and pretty much everything about it was terrible. But at least Cliff Eidelman's music score was fairly decent. It's not brilliant, certainly not a patch on Vangelis' score for 1492: Conquest of Paradise or the works of James Horner, Jerry Goldsmith or John Williams, but its not bad either. It should have been much exerberant and exicting, really but it's worth listening too while your doing homework or household jobs because its quite smooth and relaxing, if unmemorable."
5,The Best Business Book I Have Read,"This is the best business book I have read. It is also one of the best human interest stories I have read.The author's crisp writing style and reader-friendly formatting make this book an easy read, although his analysis, diagnosis and recommendations are quite sophisticated.The writer is a rare combination of a big league strategist who also has his feet in the real world. He intertwines facts, strategy and practical tactics in a remarkable way.Nolan has clearly done considerable research and the results show in the book. The author brings Delta's success, decline and path to bankruptcy alive for the reader. The lessons he provides, drawing on the Delta case history, will be valuable to any leader - or follower.The book is so engaging I had difficulty putting it down, so I read it in one sitting."
2,ITS ON SOUNDSTAGE!!!,"I was disappointed that I had already seen this before. This live performance is also featured on Palladia. Thus, I was very upset when I received it. The DVD is great, but I wish it had more information before I bought it."
1,Cheryl Crow is awful!,"This concert is like all the rest of Cheryl Crow's music, BORING and CHILDISH!Her whiny voice and tone deaf guitar playing is the worst I've ever heard. She hasn't gotten any better on guitar and needs lessons from a pro. I think an electric guitar would be better. She could play power chords so the sound would cover up her beginner guitar playing. Please stop playing that awful song, ""all I wanna do..."" Most people hate it and can't get the lame sing song thing out of their heads for years! And stop singing about Lance! Get over it. She needs to go sit in the sun and shut up for a change."
4,Great Sound and picture from a performance in 2004,I loved this performance the 1st time I saw it after I got Comcast Hi-Def back in 2004. This performance was filmed and mixed in Hi-Def loss less audio. So if you have a state of the art Home Theater you're going to like this one.I have read a few of the reviews and several people assumed understandably that due to it's 2008 release to DVD it was recorded the same year. The performance took place in June 2004.Please see the PBS Soundstage information: [...]Well worth getting!
5,Gran televisor,Es un gran televisor para un precio excelente. Una joya de los ultimos modelos analogos.
4,Shipping was way too slow but the charm is really nice!,"I ordered my pendant from David's Jewelers but this is the same one. The pendant I recieved was proportionate to what a pendant size in relation to a chain should look like. It looks good with my 3.0 mm 24 inch chain. Unless you are giving the 1/2 inch size to a baby, small child, or as a charm for a bracelet, don't bother ordering that one. Shipping took a very long time but customer service was top notch and the end product was worth the wait."
2,too scary (and gross),"The illustrations in this book are simply too gross and scary. The pirate has the worst teeth I've ever seen, and most of the characters have sinister or threatening expressions on their faces. The watercolors are beautifully detailed in a technical sense, but the few times I've read this book to my daughter I cringe. I think I'll ask my wife if we can get rid of it. At the end, the ""punchline"" depicts all these kids dressed in cute costumes, and you realize that all the grossness was in their imaginations. Well, I don't like this for two reasons. First, I don't like the technique of exaggeration followed by ""just kidding."" Secondly, I don't get why it is good to encourage imagining gross or scary images, especially at the young age the reading level of this book seems to imply.Arden Druce's other Halloween book called Halloween Night is illustrated more conventionally."
3,leatherman tool case,"The leather is very thin, I have another older leatherman tool and the case is much better"
4,A very descriptive tale of secrets that span decades.,"This story holds you captive by remaining mysterious but giving you enough clues to keep you intrigued. I couldn't put it down. The main character Lily Molyneux charms you, and at the same time enrages you. She is the sole cause of all the numerous problems throughout the story. I would reccomend this book to anyone. I enjoyed it, and I'm sure that you will too."
5,I LOVE this CD!!!!,"This is one of my favorite CD's! It sounds great on my IPOD and I listen to it at the gym all the time. My favorite song is ""Stories"", April has an awesome voice!!!!Grab a beer and invite some friends over, and pop in the CD....."
4,First attempt on describing boas,"This book is the first one in trying to describe the living boas. The author tells in a bright way the differences between the species. Also there is a clear way of telling general things like names of scales, scalecounting, describing the habitat and so forth. I've read the book with lots of pleasure and I 've used it several times to look after some deatils about BOAS.Jan Ramaker, Simonshaven, The Netherlands"
5,EXCELENTE,"LO ADQUIRI DESDE COLOMBIA Y ES EXCELENTE DEJA LA PIEL SUAVE Y REMUEVE LAS CELULAS MUERTAS, HUELE MUY RICO Y EL PRODUCTO ES GRANDE"
2,Disappointing,"I just got this book today and I'm disappointed. If you want something very, very basic and simple. This is it. It does have a pansy that's nice. Most of the flowers aren't very interesting and don't look like any flower I've ever seen. Still, it's a start."
1,Ugly flowers,"I wish I had read the previous review before I ordered this. The flowers are ugly, as in ""why would anybody ever make these"" ugly. Darla Sims, the author, must have been hallucinating to even call these flowers. The first one, the ""serendipity flower,"" is just ribbon bunched together to resemble an overgrown pompom. It is too much trouble to return this for seven dollars, and maybe it will give me some ideas on how not to do flowers. I implore you, please don't buy this unless you see it in a store and look through it. If you must have it after looking through it, although I can't see why you would, then purchase it knowing I have tried to save you and failed."
2,"pedal press,, not so smooth","this device is not as easy to use as other Brake Pedal depressors. The design is hard to apply,, and not so good."
5,Pure enjoyment - money well spent for this CD,"I bought Jon's CD as soon as it hit the market. ""Willin"" is superb. Jon is such an excellent guitarist and singer and is able to transfer the mood of his songs to the listener. I love ALL of the tracks which is something I cannot say about any other CD I own. His song writing is nothing short of genius. I've seen him live in concert and was never disappointed. The versatility of this CD insures something for everyone. It's haunting, it's driving, it's sorrowful, but never boring. I hope JR makes many many more self produced albums. I'll buy every one of them. I also found a hidden track on this CD after #11 - wait about 45 seconds and you will hear the crackle of a needle on a record and ""Sweet Loretta"" like you would have heard it in the 50's. Just too too cool."
5,Don't judge this album by the audio available on this site..,"The first four songs are the lamest of the whole CD - that is if you are into techno. Tracks by My My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, Moby, Ministry and Tom Bailey are the true gems. Be ready for mood altering beats as your mind drifts where the Doodles are. Really, good stuff."
2,"Unless you like the cover, don't bother.","If it weren't for the tracks by Bowie, Thompson Twins, and Electronic, I'd toss this disc in the trash. The techno stuff just doesn't cut it for me. Very annoying. I suppose if you like to ""bang your head"" without wanting to be associated with AC/DC listeners...."
5,Musical Ecstasty,"This is a Must-Have soundtrack if you like New Wave, electronic/techno music - almost every song is outstanding. Especially cool tracks are Electronic's Disappointed (side project of New Order's Benard Sumner and Smith's Johnny Marr, guest vocals Pet Shop Boys' Neil Tennant), Moby's Ah-Ah, David Bowie's 'Real Cool World', & Future Sound of London's Papua New Guinea."
4,I remember this well,"I remember when this movie came out - 1992 which only seems like yesterday to me. I only saw when it was on cable TV, about a year later. Strange premise for a movie, but not the first time animation and live action were done together. The soundtrack was right for the film. Also, of an interesting note, this CD was a favorite among strippers at some of the clubs I went to. ""Sex on Wheels"" and ""Play with Me"" were among the most played songs that the girls danced to. Ah, memories indeed."
5,"Super talented artist,amazing single.","As a fan i expect amazing stuff from this artist,this cd is no exception..super single remix and sound quality...grab it now."
4,Good collection,If you like Alabama you will like this unless you already have all of these songs on another Alabama CD. In that case you are wasting your money.
2,Disappointing Study Guide,"This study guide seems to ramble, covering topics before fully defining or explaining the topic(s). Also, it is filled with questions following each chapter, but you are required to purchase an ""Instructors Guide"" (CD costing over $100.00) to know if your answers are correct or not. Most study guides include the answers to questions in an appendix or at the end of each chapter. This guide is helpful but lacks clarity and completeness and requires extra time checking answers to topic questions."
3,"Not bad but not very good, either.","This guide did help me pass a test that I hadn't taken in over 10 years. It has a large amount of of information. Now for the bad news. It's full of typos and inaccuracies. And, no answers to the numerous practice tests. The answers, it seems, can be found on some kind of instructor's CD that Amazon doesn't sell nor is available directly from the publisher. What I finally found after searching the publisher's poorly designed web site for quite some time was a download of the answer keys for a yet another $14.95. Overall, not a good experience."
4,Electrical Study Book,"I find this book very good, easy to get throughI give it only 4 stars as the book does not come with theanswers."
5,Exellent Book for theJourneyman Test,"This book is very good, I have been used it for almost 4 months and I have learned alot with this book. it takes you step by step on each of its chapters with Tips, problems and quiezes. IF YOU WANT TO STUDY FOR JORYNEYMAN'S TEST THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU."
2,Pain in the butt!!,"I bought this study guide to prepare to get my journeyman license in multiple states.This study guide seems very thorough, but I will have to update this review once I'm done testing.The most frustrating part of this, is that the dang thing doesn't come with any answers. Those are located at one particular site, at an additional cost of $20. I decided to pay for them, and downloaded them. However, it comes in the form of a protected PDF and cannot be printed, and can only be accessed while logged onto the internet. I travel a lot, and would rather just print a copy and take it with me so I can study whenever, while not having to drag my computer around.I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you are willing to sit in front of a computer, in which case you might as well do an online prep course."
2,book without the answer sheet is no good.,"Where is the answer sheet for this book, for in electrical you need to know if your caculations are right, there is no guess work about it, if you don't carry them then you should not sale the book, if you do carry them why can't I find them in the section with the study guide for 2011 journeyman electricians book."
3,"Interesting pictures, superficial text","This appeared in 1962, only 17 years after the war ended. The text and captions are brief and superficial. The pictures are interesting, although it would have been better if there had been more, and if it had been a large hardcover instead of a paperback."
4,the music we remember,hearing these old songs from the early 80s bring back the memories of the time . great Cd add it to your collection
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book for the Christian who wants to receive God's financial blessing. It will change your view of money and how to attain it. There isn't any technical information on actual investments, but the author does include a list at the end of the book of other books that will educate you on specific financial investments. This book is a great start for someone looking to achieve wealth the Christian way. The author backs up the statements he makes with Bible verses throughout."
4,Becoming a millionaire God's way,"Becoming a Millionaire God's Way: Getting Money to You, Not from YouJust what I needed to understand to move to the next level of millionaire status God's way"
5,great book,"I have read this book 3 times, each time I got more out of it. It contains so many life changing principals. Things you can apply to your life right away. Get this book right now and buy some copies for friends.I strongly suggest to all you get this book.Get Rich dad poor dad,and then buy Dr Tom's sons book,Think like a Billionaire by Scott Anderson.These books changed my life!!!!!!!!!"
4,Refreshing!!,"This book was great. It motivated me to start living different, as far as money is concerned. It was refreshing to read a book on investing through the eyes of a christian. I found the book very usefull, and was full of little bits of information that is not taught in any school or university. The only downside to the book was that it did not offer helpfull hints or lessons on what to invest in or what to look out for, other than just saying invest in stocks and 401k etc. The book was more about motivation to live different, to be money literate, and for christians to not feel guilty about becoming or being rich.I would recomend this book, for it did have some interesting angles to the finance world. However it does not give you the ingredients needed to become an successfull investor. But then again, what book does?"
1,"save your money, don't buy this book.","this book is pathetic and a waste of money. there aren't any wealth building strategies --spiritaul or secular--in this book. the clown that wrote it talks about flipping real estate as a wealth building strategy. since the economic meltdown of 2008, how's that workin' for ya? the author throws in a bunch of very basic investment advice that anyone can glean from a fidelity brochure. what happened to the principles of seedtime and harvest??? had the author edited his manuscript and condensed this ""book"" into a pamphlet, it may have been alright."
1,Gospel Truth?,"I am not sure when the gospel became about creating wealth and security for ourselves. The last reading I had, it was about finding security in God and thus giving my life away to caring for other people.Matthew 8:19-2119Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, ""Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.""20Jesus replied, ""Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."""
5,Expand Your Horizon,"Dr. C. Anderson's material in this book was life changing! It will open your eyes to the reality that everyone of us has the ability to create wealth in our lives regardless to our education, status or ethnicity! Since reading his material I have launched a business idea that is not only producing an incredible amount of wealth in my personal life, but I am finally able to help meet the needs of ministries around the WORLD!! What an amazing feeling!EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK AND THEN GET READY FOR INCREASE!!"
5,Incredible,"I sat in my living room and read this book for four hours..it was incredible. There are so many layers to the text that you could read it over and over again and find something new each and every time. The characters were extremely dynamic, and I could relate to a certain aspect of each and every one. I felt entirely submerged in the three-dimensional world that was ""Blind Crescent""."
4,nice colors,"The music on this album is seriously underrated because of the silly cover and the legal disputes Zappa was involved in around the time of this release (well documented on the Lather album whis encompasses tis album, Orchestral Favorites, Sleep dirt and Zappa in New York BUT NOT QUITE).First buy Leather and if you like it enough (and you should) you may want the other versions as well."
5,"If you like Zappa for his compositions, this is his best album","Definitely moments of Varese and Stravinsky in here. The improvisations are relaxed and inspired. The shifting polyrhythmic odd time signatures are executed flawlessly and with feeling. This is quite simply a compositional and instrumental tour de force.Revised Music for Guitar and Low-Budget Orchestra and RDNZL are two of my very favorite compositions of all time by anyone in any style of music. Greggory Peccary is certainly fantastic and has truly stellar moments, but I find I don't listen to it as much as the other two. I often forget that ""Take you to the Beach"" is even on this album.If you like this album, try:Waka/Jawaka,The Grand Wazoo,Frank Zappa: Apostrophe / Over-Nite Sensation,Roxy & Elsewhere,One Size Fits All,Sleep Dirt(I like this one better without the vocals), or theLätherbox set. You don't need to buy Studio Tan if you buy Läther because it has all the same mixes of the same songs."
4,nice colors,"The music on this album is seriously underrated because of the silly cover and the legal disputes Zappa was involved in around the time of this release (well documentend on the Lather album whis encompasses tis album, Orchestral Favorites, Sleep dirt and Zapp in New York BUT NOT QUITE).First buy Leather and if you like it enough (and you should) you may want the other versions as well."
3,Who is making those new brown clouds?,"I'm ambivalent about much of Zappa's work from the mid-70's onwards but this album contains one of his most amazing creations: ""The Adventures of Greggary Peccary"". Never mind all that arid orchestral nonsense Zappa was inclined to puke up every now again to prove his avant-garde credentials, this track blows that stuff out of the water in terms of ingenuity, creativity and risk-taking. Probably more than any other track in Zappa's oeuvre, this track is as much influenced by Carl Stalling (a great 20th Century American composer) as Stravinsky. Not only that, but lyrically it is both amusing and intriguing (though it runs out of steam towards the end) being both a parody on ""trend-mongers"" and a philosophical treatise (well, sort of) on the nature of time. The rest of the album does little for me, I confess to finding ""Let Me Take You to the Beach"" especially irritating."
3,Soft/Hard/Hard/Hard...But the soft is 25 minutes of an LP!,"Greggory Peccary, is not for Cd. listen at you own peril, as it is a rock ballet. The other 3 trax are ungodly. if Peccary were 12 min instead of 29, another tune liek the last 3 would have made this a 4 star album...but due to the time constraints, this is great, but not essentiak AT FTRSt"
5,A Great Zappa Tour-de-Farce,"Next to Overnight Sensation and Apostrophe, this is my favorite Zappa album, despite how different it is from the other two. This CD is freakin hilarious. I still nearly pee myself listening to The Adventures of Greggery Peccery, not just from lines like ""Here was a gregarious wild swine on his way up"" or ""dancing to a 50 foot high pile of transistor radios, each tuned to a different station"", but from the ridiculously dissonant, circus-like instrumental passages that at first sound like a marching band of 5-year-olds, until you realize how astoundingly intricate and tight they are (which is what makes them so funny). The same musical shenanigans can be heard on the two instrumental pieces. And of course the howlingly funny send-up of surf music, Lemme Take You to the Beach. Altogether a great, but not well-known, Zappa gem."
5,Where do they get these people?,Once again Syngres has put together a top notch team of Lego builders. The robots in here are incredible to say the least. I was amazed to see that CS Soh had a hand in this book as I've been a big fan of his LEGO work on the web for some time. I just finished building all of the robots in the prequel to this book for the Star Wars Dark side lego kit when I saw this become available. These are all top notch robots built by people who know their lego robots. They don't beat around the bush-they give you step by step instructions for buidling these robots. They go one step beyond the first book by giving you alternate building instructions for download. I'm going to use this in my high school robotics class. Top notch.
2,kind of dumb,Not worth much. My kids didn't really get into it and the whole idea was just lame. I feel bad saying that because I know they're trying to do something good for children here but it just didn't work.
5,Great Movie!,"Treasure hunts. Who doesn't remember digging under the porch, in creekbeds, hollowed out logs, etc to find the buried treasure you just KNOW is hidden there somewhere? Hanna's Gold is a fun-filled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past."
2,The Little Book of Poker,"I was disappointed in this book only because I believe it did a great writer a disservice by limiting this thoughts and observations to thin sketches. Now, to be honest, I have never seen his poker articles in print, and I am just assuming these are excerpts, but each story seems to be missing some fullness the subject surely possessed. I know Mr. Spanier was a thoughtful poker observer, so I am erring on his side here. Maybe at the time and for the readership that was how his articles needed to be."
3,Zim&Gir,"For those who are Invader Zim Fans & you'd like there to be a game in Invader Zim then is a must have game,so try it out & you'll probably might like or perhaps you might love."
4,Book in good condition - took long to arrive,"The book is in good condition. My only issue is that it literally took about 3 weeks to arrive, the longest I have ever waited for a book to be delivered."
1,Not a Reference,"If you are an experienced coder looking for an strict HTML, XHTML, or CSS reference, I suggest you move on to another title. If you are a novice in HTML using a WYSIWYG editor and want to start getting into the HTML code itself, then this is a good book for you. I bought this book to refresh myself in HTML, and CSS being away from it for several years. I program in VB and VC++ and have many programming references that are excellent and very concise. Unfortunately this book is neither. The writers persistently wander off on long winded tangents that seem to ramble on and on.... and on! The analogies had me scratching my head wondering just what exactly the comparative <sp> was? There are many small chapters in the last half of the book that are nothing but fluff and offer no real information.In closing, there is useful information in this book for the novice. However it is not complete or in any particular order. Happy hunting."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This book is not worth your money. It is poorly written, does not explain code, and is very incomplete. Bible in its title is very misleading..."
5,This book blew my mind,"After hearing Stuart Ewen's amazing speech in Chicago in early June (he was keynote speaker, along with Oprah Winfrey, at the 1997 Promax/BDA convention) I rushed out and bought his book. I had a feeling I needed to read it. I was right. The book blew my mind. The role of propaganda in our everyday lives, the widespread strategies of mental and visual engineering, were laid bare with remarkable clarity. This book should be required reading for anyone living within shouting distance of American commercial culture...That means everyone"
1,Junk reading,"I read ""Captains of Consciousness"" by the same author before I purchased this book. That book was so-so so I decided to give this one a look.This particular book is very poorly written, lacking both in style and substance. The title of the book is misleading because from reading the it, it became apparent to me that the author did not intend on writing a serious, thorough, or even thoughtful examination of PR and its history. The author basically summarizes the work of other people - lots of other peoples, except this is done very unevenly so the reader does not get a solid impression of the subject matter. While the book is broken up into chapters, these chapters are not chronologically ordered, so one cannot follow the material from Chapter 1 - the beginning to Chapter X - the present. Ontop of the endless summaries of other persons works, the author in no way join together these works into a conclusion, all this add up to a very unsatifying read."
2,"Simplistic history, lacks breadth, left-wing, only a start","Although a good review of the PR industry, Stewart Ewen's book has a simplistic ""good vs. evil"" view and lacks historical breadth. Ewen is obviously fairly left-wing, and paints conservative PR figures as ""necromancers"" repeatedly, while defending FDR's PR efforts in the depression as noble. There was also a real failure to identify other historical forces that shaped PR and America's faith in technological progress (as delivered by industry), besides the evil conniving of PR working for industry. This failure makes me wonder a little about the scholarship that supports this book. It's too emotional. Someone with broader historical/social knowledge should build from this, and write a definitive history."
1,Worst book I've read in a long time...maybe ever.,"The characters weren't fleshed out, the whole thing took place in less than a week. It really isn't even worth ninety nine cents.Save you time and your pennies and skip this one."
4,Good comedy movie,The comedic situations are hilarious (while the dramatic ones are overtly melodramatic) and the actors mostly do a great job. Juhi Chawla and Ketki Dave steal the show with their natural comedic abilities. Asrani is great as the sympathetic film buff boss. Govinda too is likable. He and Juhi are great as the ideal neighbour. I would have liked to see Tabu do more comedy but she's stuck with a serious role of which she does nothing short of a decent job. Even Johnny Lever (whom I find intolerable in almost every other movie) is enjoyable (though his character is hateful). A relative newcomer Isha Koppikar has a refreshing screen presence and holds her own while Chandrachur Singh and Vinay Anand are quite annoying.
5,Love the P Touch,OEM cartidge at a discount from the regular store prices. Great quality at a good savings. I highly recommend this.
5,"Nicely integrates research, theory, and clinical practice .","Nicely integrates theory, research, and the considerable clinical experience of its two authors. It is written with a healthy and complex appreciation of broader issues in the field of family violence and family therapy and gives a great deal of thought-provoking case material for those interested in understanding more about sibling abuse dynamics and its potential treatment strategies."
3,Great project for kids,This is great. A real fun project for your creative child. The cutting/pieces are very detailed though so the age restriction really applies: children under 8 would likely have a hard time. I think that I will enjoy doing this more than my daughter!
3,good hands on,"Bought this for a friend's daughter. She had something similar that was computerized which I wasn't aware. However, this is good for fine motor control and better hand's on. The friend says she likes it. Thought the pieces were a little small, however."
3,It's ok.,"An ok DVD, a must if you are a big Jeff Hardy fan. If not, then you probably won't enjoy this. The Documentary as well as most of the matches cover from 2003 until Jeff's departure from the WWE, except for a couple matches."
4,The violet tornado strikes!,"Just before a dream delivered Roland Kirk his extra name, (Rahsaan), he made this whirlwind. Atlantic and Joel Dorn were giving him some loose reins, and he ran.In his head? ALL of jazz history, Stravinsky, Mingus, the organ in old radio serials, Quincy Jones, Lady Day, harp.Saxes, two or three at once, flutes, sound effects!There wasn't anything remotely like it then, and there hasn't been since.rfgsBTW, my reviewing nickname is a quote from ""Black Mystery has Been Revealed"""
5,Great tattoos for little boys!,We bought this sea creatures tattoos after trying the shark ones and I must say they are of great quality ;D looks realistic and durable ;)
5,The Best Before the Rest!,"This was the first Zappa I ever heard, and it began my adult lifelong obsession with the music and social observations of FZ. This is the best, music is the best, Frank Zappa is the best."
4,"The beginning of his last music era,,,more accessible!!","This is the beginning of the so called ""New Era"" for F. Zappa: such an accessible stuff, enriched with a lot of sexual references and bizarre features of ""depravity"" as well...otherwise it demonstrates also his ability in telling a story, by means of his particular music language!Moreover by regarding of his killer guitar solos and other stunning examples of some violin solos by Jean Luc Ponty, it isn't difficult to fall in love with this album.Recommended, also for his sociological tough satire!!"
4,Andy Reddings is a simple Zappa hater,"I can accept people not liking or even hating certain Zappa albums but to be so utter hateful and moronic to review all Zappa's albums with the same mindless reviewtext... I mean, there's no way this guy has heard all Zappas albums (especially since they are so different from each other)and come off with the same conclusion. Please remove his unprofessional ramblings from the site."
3,a few classics,"bought it for dina-mo-hum.Which still cant be played on th.e radio,except maybe for k-pig radio.Classic frank zappa back in the day"
5,Best Zappa ever!!,"Zappa at his finest! LIsten to the jazz,rock,blues and who knows what other influences. Pay paticular attention to the drumming of Ralph Humphrey. No finer drum work can be found! If you don't have this one,you're missing out big time!!"
4,great rock sound,how could someone named andy state (seriously) that zappa is over rated - and give a g3 recording 5 stars ?
5,Not Over Night Listen To This Anytime Any Day Biatch!,First song I ever heard by Frank Zappa was Montana and am I glad i heard that song first because everysong on this album is as good as each other just in different ways. Not one weak track one this one. Now i'd suggest this is a essential to your collection because it's got all of the Frank Zappa elements in it.True Music Baby Ture Music!
3,classic songs - mediocre album,"After hearing great live versions of camarillo brillo, dirty love, zomby woof and dinamoe, i think the original studio versions are to slow and dull. Sorry, i just cant get used to them...Im the slime has never been one of my favorites actually i think its one of his worst songs. Cant understand its on Strictly Commersial.I like fifty-fifty; its powerful, weird and intense, like a cousin to ""I come from nowhere"".Montana is always great.Overall, this is tame for a Zappa album. The songs are better with other arrengments. Check out You cant do that on stage anymore 6 and you see what i mean!"
3,Not A Classic,"This is a decent Zappa album, but it's not quite up there with his greats. There are a few of his more popular songs on this album and they are the best this one has to offer:1. Camarillo Brillo: A great song with good lyrics and interesting guitar 8/102. I'm the Slime: Zappa hates television, i don't like it much, but nor do i like this song 3/103. Dirty Love: Forgettable but pretty good 5/104. Fifty Fifty: Pretty crappy 2/105.Zomby Woof: Not bad 6/106.Dinah Moe Humm: A Zappa Classic, hilarious song really catchy 9/107.Montana: Ends on a high note, excellent solo (best on the album) 9/10"
1,Disappointment,"Up until this album, Frank had been consistently great and uncommercialized. This was the turning point, the start of the long slow slide into slicker mediocrity. The song lyrics no longer mattered, were not thought provoking, and his music no longer had a huge impact on one's mind and one's life. With this album, he became a commodity like everyone else in rock. What a let down."
4,Great book for beginning ibookers,"This book was very useful when I first got my ibook. It is easy reading and very informative for basic ibook tasks. However, it does not go into the basics of applications such as appleworks, etc. and as I got more familiar with my ibook, the book had less to offer for me. I ended up buying other books with even more mac/ibook secrets that this ""little"" did not have room for. It also has nothing on OS9 or much on any OS. I had to learn about my operating system from another book. If you just want bare basics of ibook, then this is the book to get. If you're not a first time mac user and/or are comfortably familiar with your ibook, then this book may be to basic for you."
4,"""Year Of The Comet"" equals Celtic romp.","Hummie Mann may be one of Hollywood's most under used musical talents. His score for ""Year Of The Comet"" teams a modern score with the traditional music of Scotland. The music dips and swells and surely enhances, not only the film itself, but the mood of the room that you're sitting in as you listen to this masterful score. From the hard action beat of ""Helicopter Chase"" to the moving ""End Credits"" you'll swear that you smell the heather and the sea of the coast of Scotland. Absolutely, one of my favorite soundtracks of the '90's."
3,Good,"Zappa loved doo-wop, and Rubin and the Jets is the Mothers' pure foray into the genre.Except for some of the lyrics, this is pure doo-wop, and so you really have to like this music to enjoy this album, unless you are an extreme Zappaphile.Putting this out in 1968 was such a contrairian gambit--it was all the music everyone was rebelling against- was a gutsy move.And why Zappa was and will forever be, Zappa."
3,A couple of good songs,"I love frank Zappa, but this CD wasn't quite his best one. It had a couple of good songs, like Jelly Roll Gumdrop and No No No."
3,A question,"I have not heard his CD but I did own the LP at one time and would rate it 3 stars only because it had a very funny parody of garage band histories (along with a classic picture of Zappa) on the back. It, frankly, was the best part of the LP. However I have this memory of Little Richard's song ""Directly from my Heart"" being on the LP. Can anyone verify this for me? Is my Alzheimer's taking over?"
2,A ruined version of a great album,"Ah yes, Ruben and the Jets. Pull out your Verve vinyl, and listen to the vintage sounds of Zappa and the Mothers reconstructing their heritage of classic doo-wop and r&b.What? Your vinyl was lost or destroyed? Your record player was donated to charity?Well, go buy a record player and a copy of the old vinyl version of this, because the current cd is garbage!In the mid 80's, Zappa decided that the drum and bass sounds on two of his album, WOIIFTM and Ruben, were simply not up to snuff. He made the thoroughly bizarre decision to re-record those parts with current band members.The result is something like a modern remix of a sixties-era track - it just doesn't work. The bass and drums do things that nobody did in 1969. They simply sound wrong.So, if you want to hear this album properly, get the old vinyl. The cd is good for a laugh, but not for much more."
1,Wouldn't touch this CD with a 10 foot long battle lance!,"Cruising With Reuben And The Jets is my favorite Frank Zappa album. Love the overall satire, Deseri, & Jelly Roll Gumdrop. I first heard the album when ""Little Brother"" brought it home sometime in the late 70s. I picked up this CD when it was released because I needed my own copy. I was extremely disapointed when I found out it had been remixed and no longer sounded as it should. (It is a satire on Do-Wop afterall and should sound like Do-Wop) I just borrowed ""Little Brother's"" original vinyl record last week and taped it. I won't be wasting my time with this CD again. I now have the original vinyl mix and it sounds like it should.GET THE VINYL..........IT'S INFINATLY BETTER!"
2,another fan who thinks the remix is sh*t,"I bought the cd and couldn't believe that Frank thought he had improved on the original mix.Thankfully, I have a cdr version of the vinyl.If you can find me on the web, you can get a copy from me."
3,Okay 3.5 but no choice for that,"this recording is a good doo woppy type of record, and if you enjoy that stuff, it is a good deal. Very well done.BUT, it is worth the price of admission if just for one track alone.. STUFF UP THE CRACKS, check out the power chording slapping of the guitar that FZ does at the end of the song. It begs you to hear more. It is done so well that even Pete Townshend would be jealous.I keep replaying that Song. It is odd because power chording just seems to strange to the doo wop format, but FZ makes it fit like only he could."
5,Really close to a masterpiece,"Zappa goes back to his roots & writes what I would call a doo wop album,although it is much more than that. Every Zappa fan should own this one. A good first album to start with if you are not a Zappa fan as is 'HOT RATS'. I love the way Zappa sucker-punches everyone with the outro guitar on 'STUFF UP THE CRACKS'. I don't know if the man was genius or not but he left some impressive music behind."
1,This is a mess!!,"This remastered CD is a disappointment for those who remembered the original album. What was Zappa thinking? I can't tell you how sad I felt when I listened to this pathetic mess. Luckily, I still have the vinyl, but unfortunately no turntable."
4,2012 Reissue - of an old Favorite,"Not necessarily the finest Mothers album ever - Ruben and the Jets still does a fine job of bringing some Doo-Wop inspired Zappa tunes to life.I subtracted one star because this is NOT the ""original"" vinyl mix - but the remixed version Frank tinkered with years later, and I (like many) feel some of the charm was lost with the tinkering.If you are looking for the ""original"" mix it's still available on CD as ""Greasy Love Songs"" directly from the Zappa website."
2,Should of paid more attention,Same lousy revisonist mix from the late '80s. That string bass's prominence ruins an otherwise great Lp. Stay away!!!!! More corpse feeding.
3,Not the origonal mix,"I hoped this would be the real thing. Not so. It is the mid 80's remix with the replaced bass & drum tracks. All the origonal cover art is restored, just not the music. Damn."
1,shop local--save shipping,"The cost for the shipping for a sticker, is as much as the item, itself. Shop locally and save the money!"
3,"A great ""could-have-been""","This book is quite good, but I really think that the idea has a lot more to offer. The book is great for a quick reading of Gibson's history and the evolution of the Les Paul model in particular, but I think it could have been more clearly-structured. Not everything is negative though, there are great pictures, and I like the emphasis on descriptive details about the guitars. I wish this book had 30 or 40 more pages worth of text and pictures, that would have been great!"
3,This is no Midnight in Sicily,"Don't get me wrong: I love Peter Robb's writing and I am green with envy at his ability to find ways to spend long periods of time in Italy. But, it seems that there was too little historical fact about Caravaggio's life to build a book like this around. Robb's book, Midnight in Sicily, had much recorded history to serve as a framework, which, coupled with contemporary descriptions of life in Southern Italy and Sicily, grew into very compelling reading."
3,Don't Forget to Eat Your Broccoli,"I first saw a work by Caravaggio at the Vatican exhibit during the World's Fair in New Orleans. My wife and I were truly moved by Christ's Burial and I have always wondered what type of man could paint in such an amazing manner.Sixteen years later, I was prompted to purchase the book M by a positive review of the book in the Sunday Books section of my local paper.Am I glad I purchased and read the book? Yes, much like I am feel good when I eat low fat--but tasteless-foods. I know I am doing something good for myself, but, jeez, does it have to taste so bland?Anyway, eat your broccoli and read this book. You'll feel better about yourself when you're finished. Then you'll do what I did and purchase the new Tom Robbins book and eat a pizza."
3,"Interesting, but a Pain to Read","In short, a well-researched and interesting book written in a virtually impossible-to-read style. Caravaggio's life holds your attention, but the double-contractions, lack of punctuation and single-character reference to Caravaggio as 'M' (including such mechanical feats as ""M'd've"" (i.e. ""Caravaggio would have"" (I think.)) make for an unnecessarily long read. Robb's insight into Caravaggio's style is impressive, but hampered by the lack of plates in the book (only 8 full works). (I was driven to use a second book as a reference.) Perhaps Robb was attempting a fresh and realistic take on the English language- much like Caravaggio's take on art. A second printing after a good editing could make _this work_ a masterpiece."
4,"Great, but get a companion book of Caravaggio's artwork","Fascinating story of Caravaggio's life and contemporaries, and minutely detailed descriptions of his work. However, there were NOT enough plates in the book. After reading Robb's accounts of the paintings you immediately want to view the work itself; in most instances there is no corresponding plate, or only a fraction of the piece is shown."
1,a real disappointment,"Wow, I must say I disagree with so many of the reviews. I was deeply disappointed with the book. I was expecting a fascinating historical biography of a magnificent painter, and got a typographical error ridden screed, railing against the Catholic church (not defending them, but hey, been there, read that), and a boring habit of finding strains of homoeroticism in every inch of exposed skin. I'm truly not a bitter prude or anything, just a very bored reader of very mediocre, predictable work. Sorry."
3,"Fascinating Subject, but Hard to Read","The life of Caravaggio is certainly as exciting as that of Michelangelo, but Peter Robb is no Irving Stone. Sometimes the text is hard to follow; nevertheless, he describes the incredible life of an incredible artist and person. More illustrations would be helpful."
2,M: The Man Who Became Caravaggio,"Too long, skipped back and forth in time and place, and hated the changes in paragraph spacing. Too few images of the paintings mentioned in the book. Did not finish reading this book."
2,A Cautionary Word,"My main gripe with this book is the terrible quality of the reproductions. They are so bad I bought a $10 Caravaggio book from Taschen and tried to cross-reference. Awkward, but better than relying on the fuzzy reproductions in this book. Robb points out that the life of Caravaggio remains mysterious. Robb's version of it is exactly that: his version. He takes great pains to back up his opinions, but apparently he did his own translations. Did anyone edit his translations? The biographical elements of this book I find questionable, and to some extent he admits that they are. On a more positive note, however, Robb's commentary on the major paintings is thoughtful and fascinating. If this book remains in publication, better reproductions would certainly be helpful."
5,Great for non-art people,"I had read great advance reviews for this book, not really knowing much about Caraivaggio himself. Little is actually know about this highly influential artist but Robb has written a funny, interesting, suspenseful and engaging book based upon historical evidence. If for anything, other than your love of art, I recommend this book to those who feel things have changed over the last several hundred years. This book is a testimony of what we are, what we do, and why we do it. You will find characters (real people) so alive that you won't believe they lived 400 years ago. I've read passages of the court transcripts to people I know and they are unable to guess that these quotes are several hundred years old. Read this book! Aside from the historical context, information and beautiful descriptions of the paintings you will come away with a new understanding of who and what we are and how far we've come (or haven't) in the last several hundred years."
4,A fascinating read,"A wonderful introduction to a monumental artist. Robb provides some fascinating insight into Caravaggio's rebellion against Neo-Platonism. The book's greatest failing (for which I knocked off one star) is that it would have been greatly enhanced by more color plates referencing the paintings discussed. On the other hand, the book *is* well over 500 pages already..."
4,A detailed account.,"Very good account of what M's life MAY have been like. A little hard to read due to some of the author's ""Australiansims"" -- words such as ""yakka"" and contractions such as ""M've'd"". A good read though. There are almost no pictures in this book, which I found to be very frustrating until I bought a book of Caravaggio's paintings to use as a reference."
5,Great book!,Susan spoke at our MOPS group and was inspiring and fun. So is her book. I bought these copies @Amazon for Christmas gifts to neighbors.
5,Shastakovichg Symphonies,"Just completed the completed collection of Shastakovich Symphonies (all 15 of them!), from Amazon and associated sources. Some I like better than others, but will have enjoyable listening for years to come."
3,A classic masterpiece BUT,"Someone (Frank before he passed?I remember he was scrambeling to get all these albums to cd) decided to add some sort of wierd slap back effect on the drums at the cd mastering stage.Glad I kept my vinyl copy all of these years so I can hear Terry B. burn the way it sounded live at the show.Every thing else about this album (compositions,performances ect.)is definitely 5 stars."
4,4 stars and 1/2 is righter!!Excellent live!!,"An excellent live, featuring Terry Bozzio on drums, which is also another remarkable example of his versatility. One of his best live performances ever!!Recommended!!"
5,Can't go wrong here,"Sure this is an old cd(10 years) but its a great listen. I first heard it on the show Musical starstreams. I think it was of Forrest's favorites and it fast became one of mine as well. The main piece played was Purple Waves. It comes from Franke's album Pacific Coast Highway.Its good on that cd too. This is kind of an extended version. If you only buy it for one piece it would be this one.Remember that Franke used to be with Tangerine Dream and more recently, if you can call it that, he wrote the sound tracks to Babylon 5. Not his best work but just fyi. Get this one for the .28 cents"
3,Human Resource Management,"This book was endlessly useful because I was taking an HR Management class online and the textbook provided was an ebook. I have trouble reading books on my computer due to eye strain, so this book got me through my class."
4,"When it comes to learning , this book teaches well!","I am a mid-career professional, returning to the virtual classroom after 20 years of absence. With a study in management and leadership, this book was highly recommended and I must say, it did not disappoint!.Of the books in my book cases, this is one I will turn to again and again for insight and wisdom, guidance and increased understanding. Well written, well read and well worth the investment!"
4,GREAT PRICE,The quality of this home theater system is excellent and the price you are paying for is a steal.Take advantage of this deal before is gone.
4,Good Deal,I paired this speaker system with a Yamaha HTR5930 SL Reciever. The sound is exceptional for a systme in this price range. I don't think you can find a less expensive speaker system! The subwoofer produces excellent bass. Highly recommend it if you're on a tight budget.
4,Plextor PX-755UF Shines,"I reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as I haven't authored or copied very many DVDs with it yet. However, what I have accomplished with it is commendable. I can copy an entire commercial DVD (Movie + all the extras) under 50 minutes. I have composed a Slide show DVD with my own MP3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it.So far, no coasters. I am now in the process of producing DVDs of my old 8mm home movies. The converter is giving me more problems than anything. Still recommend the PX-755UF for anyone interested in an external burner. Installation was a snap (plug-n-play)."
1,Cleverly Omitted Information,"As a Mac user, I was excited to see this product so highly recommended for DVD burning on the Apple platform. Carefully researched this product and what the package included and decided to purchase, despite the high price tag. What is cleverly ommitted EVERYWHERE this product is listed (except in fine print on the package itself, which I didn't get to see until it arrived) is that the drivers included are only for a Windows OS. The Mac drivers are an additional $80+ through another comapny. COMPLETE rip off, and NOT clearly stated anywhere. SERIOUS reservations about this company and their products."
1,Not dependable,After a few weeks it WENT NUTS - and goes off whenever it pleases. Had fire dept. come to check - - the problem was in the unit. GARBAGE.
1,past the mfg's life date,"Product was advertised as new;when I rec'd the product, it was listed as being built in Sept 13, 2005. The Mfg's literature says that it is to last ten years. the packaging from amazon said it was guarenteed for five years. Anyway you look at it; I've been taken."
1,"Worked for 8 years, then...caught fire","Worked well for 8 years. Replaced the battery tonight and it caught itself on fire. Fortunately, I was still holding it as it began to smolder. I removed the battery and put it in the trash. Looks like I'll pick another brand."
2,This movie's writer was Edgar Allan Poo,"I was shocked to see this movie was 90 minutes long. It felt like 4 hours! Slow, boring, confusing, irritating.... I'm amazed I possessed the sheer willpower to make it all the way to the end of this dreadful piece. An extremely tough movie to get through. It doesn't really offer anything in the way of entertainment. If you have nothing, and I mean NOTHING, better to do then you could give it a shot. Otherwise there are hundreds of thousands of superior films. Such as Under Siege or 2012 or Cops and Robertsons or Boomerang or Troll or..... Well you get the idea. Just be warned, two stars was VERY generous."
1,"Dumb, DumbDumb. Need I say more?","What else can I say about this film? This is dumb, dumb, dumb, Bad acting, bland script and a stupid story. There just isn't anything good to say about this film. It's a stupid, poor attempt at a horror film. It fails miserably.I've seen quite a few Fangoria Frighfest movies and I haven't cared for one. Hence, this is the last one I will see."
2,EMPTY TOMB,"This is the 2nd FRIGHTFEST I've seen out of the 8, and I hope the other 6 are better.Loosely based on Poe's somber poem, THE TOMB is snail-paced, predictable with surprisingly poor performances from Wes Bentley, Eric Roberts and Michael Madsen.Not frightening at all and dull as dishwater."
1,Horrible. Worst of the Frightfest series of films!,"A Girl has found a way to cheat death...This Film was simply horrible. Save your money and time. I all but turned it off as it was so bad. It is as bad as the one that is in Spanish but with horrible English dubbing ""The Haunting""! See my other reviews as I have now watched all 8 films. **Grimm Love"" and ""Fragile"" are in my opinion the best 2 out of this series."
4,help??,"Hey, ya know i've seen the video of polyamorous, and i absolutely fell in love with the song, the only problem, the is the one and only site i can find any info on the band!! i would really like to see if anyone could help me get some more information on them it would help me sooo sooo much,thanx,shannon"
4,An Awesome CD,"The only thin that kept me from giving this CD 5 stars is the fact that say the f word more times than I like.Otherwise this CD is definetly worth buying, I like every song on this CD but the ones I like the most are Polyamorous,Water,Wish I May,Sugarcoat and Phase. All the songs are pretty hard with the exception of Skin,Next to Nothing and the hidden track after Shallow Bay."
4,Distorted and catchy!,"This is an interesting band. The bassist and guitarist quit their already signed band Lifer to go and join BB. Very loud guitars and very catchy tunes. Kind of what you would hear if Weezer were metalheads. The single, ""Polyamorous"" (does anybody know what that means?), was a good idea to put out as the first single. Catchy tunes will bring you catchy album sales. Haven't had a chance to see these guys live yet, but I'm pretty sure they live up to my expectations. Speaking of Lifer, check these guys out as well. A little bit darker than BB, but good and.....that's right.....catchy!"
5,The Best Debut Released in 2002,"By far the strongest debut of 2002. The 13 track CD is well crafted from beginning to end (Forever, track 13 is not listed) This release will continue through all of 2003, picking-up momentum with each new single, and they are plentiful. The CD will not disappoint and you will not skip a track. I predict BIG things for Breaking Benjamin, as platinum status is in their future...."
5,Great All Around CD!!,"This is a great CD! I listen to this thing like everyday in my car. It's one of those CD's that you can never get tired of, it's never played out. It has it's hardness and it's softy side, but it's good. They have a FANTASTIC sound! Track #5 he<Ben> sounds a lot like Gavin Rosedale from Bush, and that guy has a great voice and so does Ben. The beats are great and the bass and guitar riffs are good too. It's like a mixture of all of the great bands right now, but on this one CD, it's great! I recommend it to anyone. This is a band that I know will get very far and be very successful. If you don't get this CD, then YOU WILL regret it in the long run. But this CD, if you already have it then buy it for a friend, they will probably love you forever for doing so. It's that GOOD!"
3,Excellent start up,"Considering this is BB start up album, it isn't too bad. Only gets better from here with their other two albums...We Are Not Alone and Phobia."
3,3.5,"This is a pretty decent mix of hard rock and a slight tinge of punk-pop in a couple songs.I heard Polyamorous on the radio and thought I would give these guys a shot. I'm not disappointed, but I'm not blown away. Thick heavy guitars and melodic singing (with a few well placed yells) is the modus operandi for these guys. There's not much else you can say to describe this band, which is to say that you can find a lot of hard rock bands with melodic vocals nowadays. I like that type of music, but there's not much new ground broken here.This is an enjoyable disc. It seems some of the songs were made specifically to be radio hits (Medicate and Skin), which are the more punk/pop sounding songs, but overall the musicality is closer to Chevelle than punk (I'm not saying they sound like Chevelle, but they have a closer sound to that).Not bad, not great, but they sound like they have the potential to improve. I'll probably get the next release also."
3,Pretty good,"A lot of popular heavy music artists are going away from the Korn-type vocals towards sung/melodic vocals. Breaking Benjamin is one such band. Harder than 3 Doors Down, but a similar vocal style. Has a bit too much pop-style rhythm content for my tastes. (Recorded in Major keys, instead of the darker Minor keys) Actually 3 Doors Down is better if you want pop. If you want a heavier, and IMO better, version of Breaking Benjamin, try Trapt. Or Taproot."
5,WOW,"wow!!! this is possibly the best cd i own. ya at first i didnt know what to think about it but after i listened to it ... i couldnt stop. the music is incredible and the lyrics are powerful, but the combo of the two is breath-taking. the band can definately pull off anything. from heavy songs to very moving ballads. i can really relate to a few of the songs. like the hidden track, forever, i lost some one very close to me and this song makes losing some one a lot easier. but most of the songs you can relate to. and the other ones you cant help but love. all i can say is get this cd... buy it, burn it, download it.... whatever... just get your hands on it cause they are gunna be big!!!!"
4,Pretty good debut,"I bought this CD because of a friend of mine playing me a bit of polyamorous and I have to say that i was pretty impressed right away. The first 4 songs just came to me as very ordinary sounding songs that where good but not anything new or special. Well after those first 4 I was really impressed with what I heard after that. Ben's voice fits inreally well with the songs and he has some pretty cool lyrics throughout the CD. Aaron Fink is a really good guitar player who does more than the normal power chords (listen to Lifer for his early work). Finally a bass player who does more than just pick right along with what the guitar player does. The drummer is nothing special but at least does more than the normal steady beat and throws in a fill every now and then. All in all, I'd say these guys are very musical and have a lot of potential for the future."
3,"Good album, 2nd better.","I first heard of BB when Polyamorous was on the radio. I picked up Saturate but didn't give it a serious listen until I got We Are Not Alone, which turned out to be my favorite CD overall for summer 2004. I really liked ""Home"" and ""Sugarcoat"" and ""Next to Nothing"", but I would recommend We Are Not Alone over Saturate for a few reasons: 1) the technical clarity and proficiency is a lot better 2) the music is more innovative 3) Burnley got rid of his accent, which was really annoying to me on the first album when he sounded like he had marbles in his mouth; 4) the lyrics are better and more sophisticated as well. Saturate is still an okay album, but nothing I'd have on repeat."
5,Saturate,love this album I would definetly suggest this to other people and I have since purchase other albums by breaking benjamin
2,Saturated with ho-hum 'prog' rock.,"THEORY OF A DEADMAN, SEETHER, REVIS, DOUBLEDROP, AUDIOVENT, etc, etc, etc. All of these new bands sound the same, just like BREAKING BENJAMIN. This CD contains more of that 'prog' guitar driven unoriginal rock 'n roll with a vocalist that sounds like the bastard child of AARON LEWIS and GAVIN ROSSDALE (as does all of the above acts). Awful name, too. Yawn."
1,... ...and more ...,"Anyone who likes this band doesn't know what real music is. They only sound like every other ... band that is out there. Moreover, in response to ""Trent's"" review, anyone who compares this band to Tool, needs to get a life. No one can EVER be as intelligent and as gifted as Tool."
1,I HAD SO MUCH FUN REVIEWING THAT OTHE FILLER ALBUM THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE A CRACK AT THIS ONE.,"JUST LIKE IN MY OTHER REVIEW I CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE MADNESS OVER THESE GUYS. I WILL ASK IN THIS POST AS WELL FOR SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THEY SHOULD BE HEARD AND ARE RELEVANT IN A CREATIVE WAY. HONESTLY PEOPLE YOU CAN'T CALL THESE GUYS ARTISTS. AN ARTIST CREATES SOMETHING FROM A IDEA OR TWO THESE GUYS TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND JUST LUMP THEM TOGETHER. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND TO TOP IT OF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHOPS AS MUSICIANS TO BE RELEVANT IN THAT FORM EITHER. A COMMENT LIKE ""THEY ROCK"" OR ""THE LEAD SINGER IS SOOOO HOT"" AREN'T EXAMPLES OF A GREAT ARTIST OR BAND. FROM THE DATES OF THE LAST POST MY WORDS MIGHT BE IN VAIN, KIND OF LIKE THE VALIDITY OF THIS RECORD. BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A POST ON HERE FOR TWO YEARS. IF A FAN OF BANKING BENJAMINS DOES STUMBLE UPON THIS POST I INVITE YOU TO CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS, AND CHECKOUT SOME RELEVANT AND GREAT MUSIC."
4,Not bad at all!,"Hey, this CD isn't the best CD of all time - nor is ANY cd i've ever, ever gotten. Like most people, I started liking Breaking Benjamin when I heard Polyamourous - it was catchy with some good sonds, and I liked the singing a lot. (I was also impressed with the word 'Polyamourous') And a bunch of the songs are pretty good - if you're unsure about getting the CD, try to catch a listen of a song like 'Medicate' or 'Water' - a few good songs. I'd say half the songs on the CD are pretty darn good. Its a fun CD to listen to - if you can spare the change, get a copy. As 'a music fan' says in another review, ""Simple is often a good motto but the simplemindedness of the tracks on this CD just expose the band for what they are.... poor musicians who know a few power cords and are the next 'new sensation'."" I consider myself to openminded to opionions like that, but I'd say thats way too rough. The CD is what you'd expect, and if you liked Polyamorous, you'll like the CD."
3,Mediocre debut doesn't do band justice.,"For a true taste of this band, get ""We Are Not Alone"" or ""Phobia"". Those are both excellent examples of what this band can do. I think this cd was just slightly more thrown together without as much focus on making each song interesting. BB is one of the best hard rock bands of this decade and are growing in popularity. This is still a decent cd, but it pales in comparison to their newer stuff. If you are a fan, buy it. There are some really good songs, but it has some you'll probably feel like skipping, too."
3,does not fit 2007 F-150,"it does not fit a 07 f-150, i had to make modifications in order to use this item, which was fine for what i needed this for. (the price was right) All i was doing was adding the Extend-A-Truck 944 Truck Bed Extender (not towing)"
3,Definitely doesn't fit on a Ford F150!,"I purchased this for my 2007 F150 mainly to add on extra rear fender protection but unfortunately it didn't fit at all, not without a serious amount of drilling and cutting steel which I wasn't prepared to do!The price is right and it arrived quickly. Its a nice heavyweight, solid piece and I'm sure it must fit a lot of other vehicles just fine."
5,Great American progressive Band and album,Echolyn is just a Fantastic Band of progressive rock music that is in a real High level of musicianship and so talented is more than recommend for the listener of High Quality music that is beyond any labels . Love the entire cd!
1,Hatred,"This man if full of hate. It is very apparent why a lot of people run from ""religion"" and ""christians"".Being a Christian myself, I hope no one ever thinks they don't want to be a Christian of follow Christ because of my speech or actions.All I feel we can do for a person like this is PRAY!"
1,"A book filled with false correlations, lacks citations in MANY statements, and is overall deeply rooted in pure fear.","I read this book today in one sitting at the library. It is discretely littered with sexism and homophobia, but often times they are attempted to be covered up by statements such as ""We love gay people BUT..."" and so on. I almost wanted to ask the library if I could purchase it from them so I could use it 50 years in the future as a prime example of discrimination towards the LGBT community.Anyways, if you read this title, please, for our future children, families, and husbands and wives, do not be convinced by this book. It draws flawed conclusions, false correlations, and accuses homosexuality as the fault for nearly EVERY negative thing occurring in society.It also is laced with fear mongering tactics like I have never ever experienced in my life."
1,"The only thing on ""fire"" is Dobson's pants.",This book stands for everything that is NOT of God and Dobson's God definitely does not need to make secular laws. I hope all who read this garbage will see through this man who makes millions off of your fear and his hate.
1,I wish i could do zero stars,"This book is hateful and spiteful. Gay people are equals and should have the rights of anyone else. I can't believe that so many people in America still believe archaic thought. While the rest of the world progresses toward non-discriminatory policies, the Christian right, like James Dobson promotes in this book, further separates the USA from the first world."
1,review,How is homosexual marriage an attack on heterosexual marriage? They are not stopping heterosexual people from getting married. Has anyone noticed the divorce rate? It appears as though heterosexual couples are doing a pretty good job of destroying heterosexual marriages on their own.
3,"Fine Movie, Great Music, Not What I expected","I had no idea this soundtrack was available! The story and plot aren't really music-driven (like Footloose or even Star Wars) so I didn't expect to see the soundtrack for sale. For those who liked the music behind the love scene and the ending credits, you may wish to check out ""Double Eclipse"" by the group Hardline, from which those two tracks were taken (and they don't seem to be on this soundtrack compilation). The rest of that album is pretty awesome, as well!"
4,lenox plaster master blade,blade is great for cutting lath & plaster & rock lath does'nt were out easily but the blades could be thicker so they don't bend as easy.
4,thin cutting i would say nails no good may cut 30,they turn to a butter knife quick but puts a good dent for 6 sec used all 5 the pipe sealed up against the exhaust systems leaving catliconverter job took 45 min lowrider
1,Disk does not play !,This disc does not play on my laptop or my Oppo BDP-95 universal player.I see others have had the same problem so the manufacturer must have made a defective batch.I hope they fix this soon because I really do want this disc in my collection.Sending it back for refund
5,the rave reviews are justified,"As a long time Zappa fan,this album strangely has never come across my path. After reading the powerfully positive reviews here I just purchased it. Think of this as a more sophisticated and lush sounding Hot Rats. Buy it now!!!!!"
1,Do not buy If you want to play on a CD player or PC,"The music gets five stars (it is a classic Zappa albulm), however I cannot play the music on a CD player, DVD player, or Blu Ray player. I tried to download it to itues from a pc and it won't play in the CDROM drive. There is a cool little Grab Wazoo mini poster as part of the packaging."
2,I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM!,"This disc plays on my iMac but won't play on my OPPO BDP-95 which plays anything (I get an ""UNKNOWN DISC"" message)! This is the only disc in this series that I've had problems with. Naturally, this is one of my favorite Zappa titles..."
3,Three out of Five...,"The first three tracks are relatively uninteresting...'Grand Wazoo' should have been on Waka/Jawaka, its experimental blues/fusion/big band doesn't fit this one. The two vocal tracks are mediocre IMHO, but Cleetus has many fans. Then comes Frank's answer to miles' modal/fusion: 'Eat that Question,' a George Duke solo for the ages...then 'blessed relief'...ahhh...frank's 'so what,' featuring Sal Marquez's exquisite turmpet solo...worth it for the three instrumentals."
5,Phi Beta Zappa,"Thinking people agree that this is Zappa's finest album. Frankly, this is because there, with the exception of Calvin, is no singing. Let's be frank, Zappa, the songs were bad because the words were lousy. I will not analyze why this was the case, but again speaking frankly, Zappa's repressed anger and neurotic behavior helped to do him in in the prime of his life. Having said that, with apologies to Gail, let me again speak frankly by saying that George Duke is the main factor in making this album as good as it is. To be frank with you, dear reader, I believe that if Carla Bley had collaborated with Zappa, the musical results would have been astonishingly brilliant, but many of her records are astonishingly brilliant anyway, in my frank opinion. As John Lee Hooker frankly stated ""Nothing but the best and later for the garbage""."
5,Phi Beta ZAPPA,"This is an extremely good CD made by better than average professionals. I mean professional musicians, DG. Anyway Frank was just being Frank when he frankly stated that if you see a fish sticker on a car then you know that is 'the enemy'. That seems to be as foolish as saying that all _____ are the enemy. In other words, mindless bigotry. I met his friend Don in Palo Alto in 1977. It was a great opportunity to shake hands with Van Vliet and I learned some things about Frank that reflected Don's concern for his wayward friend. To everyone else, buy this CD from Amazon TODAY!"
3,Disc won't play,Disc won't play.Mine will play on my computer drive but not on my regular player.Others are having the same problem.
5,FZ gets serious,"Quite simply put, this is Franks best album. All of the instruments sound great, the soloing is magnificent and the compositions are very sophisticated. The rhythm is very funky and the horns are a blazen. The album quietly ends with ""Blessed Relief"" which is the most beautiful song Frank has ever written. Enjoy! And then when you are done listening to it, run out and buy Hot Rats."
3,Is anyone else having trouble with the CD,"I am a huge Frank Zappa fan, but the CD I received in August 2012, just released, will not play ?Is anyone else having this problem ?"
4,Ahh... Rahsaan,How I wish I could go back to those Greenwich Village days when Rahsaan Roland Kirk and so many other great artists played there. This is great music!
4,Good Intermediat Book,Good book but not a real beginner book. Demonstrates cords for C & G tuning. Good song selection but mostly instrumental tabs not a lot of lyrics.
3,Color isn't that great,"As one of the other reviewers mentioned, it's not really a ""gold"" color; it's not nearly bright enough for that. It's more of a bronze. I'm mostly okay with the bronze--I imagine it's limited by the fact that these are laminated tapes--but the name seems less than ideal in light of that. Other than that, the tape works fine, and the bipartite backing to expose the adhesive is much more convenient than the stuff I've seen on the M tapes."
4,Nice enough tape,"I was hoping for a good contrast tape that was different from the Black on white that's usual. This ""gold on black"" is different but probably doesn't stand out as much as a ""white on black"" tape would as explained below. With that in mind I'd probably buy a standard black/white instead of paying the premium for this one.The label shown on the picture is the same as the one on the actual cartridge but that's not what's actually inside. Gold foil on black would look really nice but the actual ""gold"" is more of a dull bronze color. Its good enough if you want something different, but theBrother TZ-631 1/2"" Labeling Tape (26.2', Black on Yellow)would probably be higher contrast though the colors are reversed."
5,My favorite tape so far,"What you cannot see in the photo here is that the gold text is shimmery/glittered. It is cool looking, not too flashy. It looks great and is my first choice when choosing a tape."
4,Harley Fan item,The item I bought is more for display with other Harley Davidson memorabilia. It fits perfectly with the rest of my items.
1,Disappointed and misinformed,"My husband had been looking for this soundtrack for several years - he likes the songs sung in the film. I finally found it and ordered it for him, and to our great disappointment it was only the music, not the songs. We are more careful now - it was a learning experiencve."
2,My Cousin Vinny Cd Soundtrack,"I have to agree with the others, I was bitterly disappointed with my purchase, soundtrack means more than the pure incidental music surely?It's a great film with great driving sound featured so why have they been left out of the soundtrack cd?The two tracks that are outstanding ""Way down South"" written by Edgar Winter sung by The fabulous Thunderbirds and the outro by Travis Tritt.I'll keep on searching thou.Julian Bishop"
1,To anyone else whos looking for the songs of the movie.,Hy. Ive read some of the reviews here and like me other people where looking for the movie songs. Well the two main themes are: End Title: Bible Belt by Travis Tritt - is somewhat hard to find in the movie version but pretty easy in its original version. The song from the opening sequence ist: Way down south by the Edgar Winter Group (Brother of Johnny Winter). Somewhat hard to get your hands on but its possible.Hope i could help.Jessie
1,Not What I Wanted,"I'm in the same boat. Why on earth would they not produce a CD with all the terrific songs with lyrics of course?Very, very disappointed when I received my order. And I am not about to search everywhere, or buy separates, to get what I want to hear."
1,not the same track as I want,"on the soundtrack for my cousin vinni ,where can I find the track with the songs that where in the film ,the original sound track is not the one I want by Randy Edelman"
2,Lots of misinformation,"I was dismayed by all the misinformation in this book. Most of the breastfeeding information is about 10 years out of date. I have the 1987 edition and was surprised by how little they revised the book when they re-released it.On top of that, the theme of the book seems to be that breastfeeding and working is hard, you probably won't be able to really do it so don't try very hard and don't feel guilty when you fail. I don't need to read a book to get that attitude; I can just talk to my relatives!The one helpful part of the book was the case studies of how different women handled different work situations especially unusual situation. It's a shame the rest of the book goes out of it's way to emphasize the negative and downplay anything positive about the choice to continue to breastfeed after going back to work."
5,A Refreshing New Spin on Fantasy,"This is a very well made adventure for the Iron Kingdoms d20 campaign. It serves as both an introductory adventure and a brief look at the new game system. I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons for over 12 years, and this is one of the most exciting new campaigns to come about in some time. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants something that maintains the feel of Dungeons & Dragons but puts a few more twists on the idea. At 64 pages, you can't find a higher quality d20 accessory for this price. Of all the new campaigns coming out for the new 3rd Edition of D&D, this is the only one to make me say, ""hey, I can't wait to play games in this world!"""
4,Steampunk Adventure,"Tired of dungeon and dragon adventures set in medieval times? Fast forward the time frame a little to the age of steam an age that never existed save in such classics as Jules Verne's 20, 000 Leagues Under the Sea. This first adventure surrounds an evil artifact and one teenage girl's thirst for vengeance. Firearms exist in this adventure so DMs need to be a little wary about the possibility of the PCs getting their hands on them. However they are considered exotic weapons so getting them and using them may not be that much of an option. Privateer Press's website promises further development of this setting if you find you like the idea after running this adventure of a Steampunk style campaign. It's a refreshing idea whose time has come. Looking for a change of view and change of seting to a more ""civilized"" age? Try this adventure on for size."
2,"Good concept, poorly executed","I owned and ran this book at one point and time, and my players detested it. The Iron Kingdoms and some of its unique culture and flair offers some nice flavor and possibilities, but my players absolutely felt the adventure way too linear, and too prone to highly restricting free will. The plot line plods along without possible tangents or opportunities or guidance to the DMs out there to go ""off track"" due to player choices, and defaults too much into antagonist confrontation situations where players have no hope to win and achieve victory. Obvioiusly there will be moments in games where players can't win the battles, but there should be glimmers of moments where highly creative groups have at least the slimmest chance and this book didn't offer that. People were selling this book at one point here for over $100, and that's just nuts. To me, it's worth the base $10 if nothing else for the content to add to a campaign environment."
1,dont buy it,"sorry to say i bought this based on the reviews and have to say it is a waste of money, slow to respond, awkard in the fit to the hand, caused me to loose to noobs on a game i am very skilled at. of the 3 gaming mouses i have tried this is the worst by far."
2,Buy a Logitech G5,"Mouse works, that's about all I can say good about it, playing games with it just sucks, be nice if you could set the 3 side buttons for what you want, like V,F,or anything that matters for games like COD4. Buy the Logitech G5,you can set buttons up for anything you want."
3,Would be great if you can get drivers,"I just recieved this mouse from Amazon.com today. It works great until you go to switch user accounts on Vista. Then it freezes and you have to unplug it and plug it back in. I tried to obtain a driver (version 1.3 fixes this issue per [..]) but the company has been bought out by Steel Series Gaming Gear that only offers information, software and downloads for it's 3 newest mice and other equipment. No mention of Ideazon products anywhere. There goes any support for my Fang Gaming Keyboard that I bought earlier this year. Needless to say, I have searched everywhere for this driver with no success, so I'm forced to return it."
2,"A mouse, but not a good mouse.","The Ideazon Reaper isn't an extraordinary mouse by any means; The ""programmable"" buttons aren't. The drivers are incredibly hard to find, google turns up nothing. The DPI settings arent very high, and over all the mouse has a weird shape. If you have one I'd replace it and if you think you want one, you really don't, which is probably part of why Ideazon no longer exists.Note: An upload for the hard to find drivers can be found here:[...]"
2,Fast but a pain,"I bought this mouse to replace the original dell mouse that came with my computer. It is very fast! Works great in-game. However, about once a week when my son switches users, it goes dead. I have tried everything on the website! So, every weekend i have to reinstall it. I am so tired of this that now I am going to look for a different brand. And Ideazon doesn't reply to my request for support. So, do yourself a favor and GET SOMETHING ELSE."
4,Great Mouse...Life Not to Great.,"Don't get me wrong, this mouse is a good gaming mouse. 1800Dpi is alot for that. I recently have been having problems with this mouse, After 5 months of use it is starting to freeze/skip. So when your playing counterstrike source, per say. You dont want it to skip around and freeze or your dead.But this was a GREAT mouse for the 5 months that i've had it."
3,Powerful.,"Franz Kafka is a true genius, there is no other way to put it. The stories are very powerful and ""intoxicating"" is the oly way I can put it. This book would have gotten a 6, only for the fact that the book lacked more stories and better translating; this is the publisher's fault. This book is a great one to start with for people just picking up on Kafka's works."
4,A great start to a fun series,"Barnes takes her time to introduce her readers to her main character, Carlotta Carlyle, former Boston police, now PI. We learn about her home, her cat and bird, her tenants, her volleyball and donut habits, and her ""sister"" Paolina. Does Barnes know she has a good thing in this character that will yield many more books? Then after we have gotten to know her, Carlotta takes a case of a missing brother who was employed by a taxi company, the same company where Carlotta had also worked, and the mysteries start. We meet some new characters and are introduced to additional plot elements. Well-plotted and nicely developed characters make this an enjoyable read."
5,A must have book for widows.,"When my husband died, a friend brought me this book. I felt the last thing I wanted was a book about widowhood. But, when I opened the cover and started reading, I knew I had found what I needed. Lynn Caine knows how it feels to lose a husband. She offers a practical and understanding approach to being a widow. I now pass this book on to other widows."
3,Bought it for rare tracks but not too impressed,"I'm a big collector of singles & imports and was interested to see that there was an acoustic version of ""Sidewalks"", along with the rare ""The Heart Of Polka Is Still Beating"" backing the cd single. I've never heard ""The Heart Of Polka Is Still Beating"", but it is a pretty good track. The acoustic version of ""Sidewalks"" is nothing to brag about; it's basically the same version on Page Avenue, minus percussion. I wasn't too impressed. But if you can find it cheap and like to collect, then I'd say go for it. Otherwise, it's not really worth the purchase."
3,Fits well but not that strong,"The fit is very snug - looks good, but you have to take the Gigabeat out of the case (through the display window) to slip it in its cradle. The case now has a small split in it - not encouraging."
1,How to ruin a great album.,"Add more bass to a recording doesn't mean that it sound well. With my great respect to one of the great mastering engineer in the music world, probably the aged ""Golden Ear"" becomes deaf, or someone told him to add bass frequencies not present in the original recording in order to delight people that listen music only from a laptop speakers or mp3 ear monitors, and believe me there's no bass player using this dull timbre. Also the enhanced bass EQ and out of tune over-compression on the bass drum destroy the original FZ intended groove. A shame. Keep it the FZ 1993 Approved Master."
3,mwah...,I find this particular album difficult to listen to because of its bad sound quality. Guitar plaing is very good and it is actually one of his most HM albums. The best tracks exist in better versions elsewhere. For completists only.
2,Zoot Allures-Frank Zappa,"First off the 2 *'s is my rating of Amazon.I was Promised a used version of the very Expensive RE-Mastered Zoot Allures CD.They Ripped me off by sending me a used version of the 1994 standard CD.I would never have paid that kind of money for any CD.Shame on YOU Amazon!I give Zoot Allures a 5 STAR rating if you like Zappa ,Buy It!"
4,excellent,"For Zoot Allures, Zappa dropped the horns and many of the jazz elements he had used with his previous band. He formed a more rock oritented band.The names of Zoots game are guitars, guitars and guitars. Of course with Zappa, even the most stipped down rock has more virtuosity than most jazz albums. Though ""Wind Up Working In A Gas Station"" is stripped 1970s rock crunch, both ""Black Napkins"" and ""Torture Never Stops,"" with their gleeming keyboards and extended Zappa axe journies, show Zappa has lost none of his lust for high musicanship.This may be a Zappa's most stripped down album, but it is still a great one."
4,"Very good, but not perfect","I was very impressed upon hearing this. There are a few throwaways, but overall it's pretty consistant. I could especially do without ""Ms. Pinky"", which is KINDA funny the first time you hear it, but in my opinion it wears thin pretty quickly. ""zoot allures"" and ""friendly little finger"" are among the best of Zappa's work. Amazing stuff. Very creative."
2,If You Buy This You Must Be Crazy ! ! !,"I have this product and it is extremely overpricedand poorly designed. Using the gun with the smallcartridge is OK with no problem but trying to use thegun for the large cartridges is almost impossible!In order to use a large cartridge you have to put thecartridge in a tube and connect the tube to the gun.This is done by compressing a hard rubber ""O"" ring andhere is the problem. Using all my strength I cannotexert enough pressure to compress this ""O"" ring and assemblethe gun. Perhaps this is just the fault of the cartridgebut this should not happen. You cannot have a caulking gunthat will work only on certain cartridges.It is better to have two guns (one for small cartridgesand another for the large catridges). For the price of thisgun you can purchase two guns. You just have to look aroundspend some time. I returned this gun and now have two seperatecaulking guns that work great (and have money let over)!"
5,Absolutely The Best,This is the best thing from the best sales trainer in the past 40 years. Live 3 day recording of an actual advanced sales seminar specifically on closing. Truly timeless info that will help any sales professional to close more sales.
3,slightly disappointing,"I was slightly disappointed with the condition of the book. It was listed as ""like new"", but it had a worn look and some marks on the cover that make it look nothing ""like new"". It is a nice children's book, however, I would hesitate to order from this supplier again."
5,Outrages price,"Great product, but you can buy the same product, same brand, same size for $2.50-$3.00 elsewhere. Just google. Do not waste your money here!"
4,Needs to be bigger (that's what SHE said...),"Costs too much to do so little, but it does what it says. I'm really good at losing these, they look like they should retail for 99 cents."
3,a little pricey,"Get it for back-up. The price is a little high for some small metal like this, but anyway when you want something, you have to pay for it. It is just a simple mandrel, and It is 100% exactly the same mandrel that comes with my Black & Decker RTX-B 3 Speed RTX Rotary Tool. They probably have made it in China for less than 10 cents.Over-priced, totally."
2,Drippy,This coffee maker brews a fine cup but is extremely frustrating to use. The carafe dips when pouring and half the water (when filling the maker) or coffee end up missing the target. I really don't have time for this sort of annoyance first thing in the morning.How hard is it to design a carafe that actually pour properly?
2,Mr. Dribbles Coffee Maker,"Makes coffee just fine. However, it is not possible to pour coffee from the carafe without dribbling it all over the place. In reality this is only a 3 cup coffee maker, since 1 of the 4 cups brewed will end up on the floor as you try to pour it. Do not buy."
1,not that great,"this looked like a good product until i used it, you have to wait until the pot is full other wise the coffee drips out and makes a mess. it also leaks every time i pour a cup of coffee what a mistake buying this piece of junk!"
5,perfect for me,Makes a good cup of joe. I'm happy with this coffeemaker. Saves counter space and keeps coffee hot when removed from the hot plate. Love how it shuts itself off in 30 minutes.
2,Darth Percolator,"This machine, which my husband and I named ""Darth Percolator"" because of it's scuba mask-like sounds while brewing, has been reliable for me and has never overflowed. Yes, you can't see through the metal carafe, but it is also easy to clean. My main complaint is the dribble factor. This carafe spills more coffee all over my kitchen counter than in my cup when I attempt to pour. I have found that it is easiest to pour the coffee into my cup whist holding it over the sink, so when HALF of the contents dump out they will not stain my floor. Bad design."
4,"Small, but good value","The total volume is 16 ounces (two cups). This is okay. I don't like drinking old over-warmed coffee, anyway.The automatic shutoff doesn't allow for over-warmed coffee or burned out elements. The stainless steel carafe means less glass carafe breakage and replacement hassle. I have had it for just a coupe weeks.Even though the plastic lid over the pot seems a little fragile and a little complicated, the DCC ""4""-Cup is a good value."
1,"Quality product, but...","The quality of materials is excellent, sleek, and smart looking. BUT... I could not pour a cup without dribbling hot liquid. Resorted to pouring over a garbage can to prevent a mess on the counter. I had several co-workers try in order to make sure it wasn't just me. Finally gave up and bought a different brand. I'm convinced it's a design flaw. Can I have my money back?"
2,Bad Engineering!,"You cannot pour coffee out without spilling a puddle. What were they thinking, did they even test the carafe and the plastic lip? Especially with a full coffee pot, you better hold your cup over the sink and wipe the pot off after you finish. These are professional engineers who design these things but stupidity and carelessness rules!"
1,impossible to pour a cup without leaking,"I have tried every possible technique, with and without the top. I have to pour cups over the waste basket in my office, and just burned my hand trying to angle it to minimize spilling. That was the last straw. I am throwing this piece of junk away, and buying another coffee maker. It is incredible that a product this bad could be sold by a reputable company."
4,Good return policy,"This is the second one of these coffee makers we have owned. My wife and I drink a lot of coffee throughout the day and we wore the first one out in 4 or 5 years (a long life span for a coffee maker in our house)We had some problems with the first item shipped to us. Only half of the water would brew leaving the remainder in the reservoir. We sent it back immediately for replacement.This was the first time I have had to return anything to Amazon. I was impressed with how easy it was, how well the system worked and how quickly the replacement arrived. The only thing that took time was repacking the return item.The new coffee maker works fine and makes a good hot cup of coffee.I will continue to use Amazon."
1,"Good coffee, until ...","I agree with the design flaws that are mentioned - yet I quickly learned that if you pour the coffee very slowly, the carafe wouldn't dribble. My knuckles didn't like the sharp ""tooth"" on the inside of the carafe rim (that helped to hold the lid while pouring) which could almost cut you when drying out the pot. I also didn't like the fact that the water filler / basket access lid always dripped condensation down the back side of the maker during clean-up. The final straw with this maker was when the cord melted. Sure, it was up against the back side of a toaster oven - but in my opinion, all counter-top appliances should have heat resistant cords. I now join the ranks of the anti-Cuisinart folks."
2,"Dribbled, then quit working","Makes good coffee, but can't stop the pot from dribbling no matter how you hold it. After six months the power switch broke and we were almost grateful for the excuse to trash this and get something else."
4,Perfect for the military barracks life,"As a cadet at US federal military academy, I have tight restrictions on appliances in my room. This meets them... auto-shut off, rugged carafe, dripless pour while brewing, small.... and it makes a nice cup of coffee. The steel carafe probably cools the coffee quicker than glass, but I need to drink it quickly anyway."
4,"Nice little machine, especially for the price.","I've had this coffee maker for well over a year, and my whole family really likes it. There are 2 minor difficulties we've experienced, but the overall performance of the coffee maker is very good. Be careful how you pour the coffee, because it may spill out as you pour it. I noticed that if I pour slowly and cautiously - holding the carafe significantly above the mug - I don't spill a drop. I also avoid getting a cup of coffee while the machine is still brewing, since it always drips a little coffee onto the warming plate. I find these 2 flaws minor, and recommend this machine if you like a good tasting, hot cup of coffee."
3,It's OK,"A stainless steel carafe seems like a great idea, but you can't see when the coffee is finished making. It makes a decent pot of coffee, and is reasonably convenient. I like the 30-minute timer feature, but the red light that shows if it is on or off is hard to see."
2,Not an insulated carafe,"Good value & makes good coffee, but the carafe is not insulated and the spout is so undersized that coffee drips down the side of the pot when poured -- so I have to give it 2 of 5 stars. The glass pots pour a lot better."
3,Plastic Fatigue,"While mostly a great coffeemaker, I can echo a previous review indicating that the plastic parts can break. On mine, both the filter cup and a connector to the lid just simply went poof for no apparent reason. Cuisinart also suffers from incompetent customer support. I placed an order for parts and supplies via their 800 number that simply went into a black hole. The order never arrived, but my credit card was never charged."
5,Love this coffee maker,"This is my 3rd Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker in 10 years. I like this maker because it is very simple in design and has an auto off switch. I also like that the filter is a cone design vs. the ""flat"" bottom design of the Mr. Coffee makers. I think it concentrates the coffee more efficiently so you use less. As far as the dribble goes the other reviewers are right, at least the previous ones I had owned did indeed dribble (a lot) unless you held the pot just right. However when I got this one I could see the design of the spout is slightly different and to my surprise it does not dribble anymore (at least for me). The only real complaint I have is that I wear them out after about 3 years. I typically uses it once a day for 1 pot, so I would not say that they have gotten excessive use. However they are relatively cheap and since I like the design I will continue to buy them."
2,Not suitable,"sorry, This coffee maker was to be used in my office. When the top is opened, condensate runs down the back and all over the desk. Not acceptable. I returned the unit and purchased a 5 cup Black & Decker. This coffee maker fills two full mugs, and so far has not leaked all over the place. I plan to keep it."
1,Leaks,Coffee leaks out of the seal near the top. Happens every time. I do not recommend buying this product. Buy something else.
1,Drips and drips,"This coffeemaker makes a pretty good cup of coffee ...but when you try to pour your coffee into your cup a stream of coffee drips on the counter. I closed the lid properly, tried pouring by slightly canting the spout. Drip drip. Finally had to place a kitchen towel under the cup...drip drip drip. The towel could not take it ...so as a last resort I had to pour my cup of coffee holding the cup over the kitchen sink. The coffee maker from hell, as my wife has dubbed the cherry tart, (unit is a cherry red) is now in a land fill....thanks Cuisinart"
4,Good for a single person,"I purchased this coffee pot to replace on just like it I purchased five years ago. I like it because it makes just the right amount of coffee for one person and is not very expensive. I have had issues in the past with the coffee pot spilling when you pour it, but I haven't had that so far with this one. Like others who have purchased this item, I just pour over the sink or pour it from a bit higher up. It may not the fanciest coffee pot on the market, but it does what it advertises."
1,Coffee Maker Review.,"It brews Coffee. Beyond that, the carafe doesn't pour easy at all and you can't pull the carafe out during the sequence in case you need to wipe water off the hotplate."
2,Drippy Spout,"No matter how hard you try the first cup can't be poured without it dripping down on the counter or sink. The coffee is good, the design needs improvement. I would not purchase another unless it was designed for function as well as form."
3,Great except it doesn't last long enough,"This is a great maker if you want under 5 cups fast and strong. But the design forces the underside of the coffee pot to scrape against the pad underneath, and in a while the pad rusts, flakes, and starts staining the pot. My first one lasted about 3-4 years, adequate though I hate contributing to landfill. The second lasted about a year and a half. I'm on my third. If something else came up that worked as well without the defect I'd switch. Oh - and the first #3 was a lemon I had to send back - the water went straight through the machine to the counter."
3,work coffee pot,"I was expecting better quality, actually, It is a cuisinart, and stainless steel, I thought it would be more substantial. The pot is stainless, but not insulated. The coffee maker is thin plastic. I am not impressed for the price I paid. I mean, it works, but no big deal."
3,Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker,"Very fast, a pot is finished brewing in five minutes. However, it is more awkward to use and clean than other cheaper models. The carafe spills water easily when pouring if you are not careful; the removeable holder for the grounds is awkward to remove; the ""pause feature"" that permits removing the carafe during brewing seems superfluous given the short brewing time. The coffee maker would be simpler and easier to handle and clean without this arrangement. Coffee is as good as others I've owned. The longevity is yet to be determined."
5,Perfect coffee,"I love this little pot, the coffee is perfect every time and it makes just the right amount for one or two cups."
2,disappointing--just not hot enough,"Very cute coffeemaker, takes up a small amount of space on the counter. Convenient to use, and I haven't noticed any problems with drips or spills. But a good coffee machine needs more than good looks. This simply doesn't brew the coffee hot enough to extract the full flavor from the grind. The coffee, as a result, just tastes blah. I like the stainless steel carafe, and the auto-shutoff feature--I never have to worry if I remembered to turn off the coffeepot. But it's a shame this just doesn't make better coffee."
1,are they still selling this POS?,"I've have had all I can take! I am pitching this coffee maker because it's impossable to pour a cup of coffee w/o dribbling hot coffee all over the counter or sink or floor. Bought it for our RV and put up with it.Sold the RV and built a cabin and still put up with it ! Until today! Yes, it's too hot,it's hard to fill, it shuts off too soon but I could deal with these flaws if I could pour a cup of coffee into a cup! Shame on you Crusinart, still selling this POS 5 years later."
1,Dribble'o'matic,This coffe pot can't ever pour without dripping all over the counter. I cant imagine they tested it before releasing for production. Terrible.
2,Mediocre Coffee Maker,"This coffee maker was a replacement for my electric percolator. At first it seemed to brew a decent cup of coffee, but eventually the coffee seemed to brew weaker and weaker as time went by. I always thought that Cuisinart was supposed to be a reliable brand, however, I've learned from my experience with this coffee maker, that this just isn't true."
2,Falls apart,"The size is great. Unfortunately several parts are made from cheap plastic that just falls apart. Now I associate ""poor quality"" with Cuisinart."
3,"Decent, but it is just that..","After having used this for a few years I am now convinced that there must be better models that Cuisinart makes that are out there. While coffee is brewing this coffee maker makes a great deal of noise, more that I would consider tolerable. Also the lid on carafe is constructed in such a way that you must hold the carafe at a certain angle otherwise the coffee will start dripping onto the kitchen counter. The heating plate will rust after a few years of use as well. With all that said, the coffee that comes out of this thing is fairly decent."
2,2 cup?,I'll start with I am never one one to write a review on any purchase. This needs to be told. Product represented as 4 cup. Must be referring to demitasse.I use standard coffee cups. I get 2 cups only with this product. If you want 4 cups you have two options. Buy two of this model or go 8 cup maker witch will give you 4.
1,the Wrost coffee maker I ever used-not,"I am writing this because I don't want other people get this coffee maker and get frustrated every time they use...I am a designer, I am sucker for the look. I got this coffee maker because it looks chic. But it is not functional.* You cannot open the lid of coffee pot. Every time I open the rid to wash the pot I get so frustrated. I burned my hand tried to open the lid while coffee is in the pot.* On and off switch is does not work well. I have press few times* Unless pot is exactly one the spot. Some coffee is on the filter is not dripping all the way."
4,Small footprint and perfect for one,This is the perfect coffee maker for one and has a small footprint. The last one I had was good for 3 yrs and it only broke because the coffee had overflowed back into the reservor and I should have washed it out the coffee grains got caught in the reservour hole that went to the coffee.
1,"Great idea, extremely poor execution.","I mirror the sentiments from previous reviewers. This should have been a great addition to our kitchen. I hate burned coffee so the stainless steel pot seemed like a good idea. I'm the only coffee drinker in the family so the 4 cup size is perfect. However, this product is chalk full of design flaws. Major dripping when pouring from pot. Difficult to fill reservoir. Reservoir cover sheds condensed steam down the back of the unit. Makes you wonder whether they tested this unit at all before deploying to market. Junk, junk, junk. Don't let the shills hired by marketing companies to write reviews fool you. This product is complete garbage. On the plus side, it does make good coffee- too bad half goes down the drain when you try and pour a cup."
3,Big drip,"How can a big company make a great little coffeemaker that turns out good, HOT coffee quickly...and use a dang carafe that drips no matter HOW you try to pour...I have tried everything to keep that rascally little carafe from dripping on the counter and nothing works. Oh well...it's a darn good coffeemaker...minus the carafe!"
3,Smell the stainless,I've always used a glass pot and thought a stainless would be better. Stick with the glass. You can smell the stainless.
3,So So Pot,"I read reviews but thought I would see for myself as I wanted a small pot in the master bath. Yes, it does leak when you pour a cup so be prepared. Does not keep the coffee warm enough. Coffee taste is ok..not good not bad...I use the same coffee and filters in my large coffee maker in the kitchen and that pot makes great coffee...so it is the small pot that is in question."
4,consumer review Cusinart 4-cup coffee pot,"I like the size, style and sturdy carafe. Pretty quiet to brew, typical slow drip brewing though. Also, can't find a carafe that doesn't ""leak"" or ""spill"" the coffee some as I'm pouring it into my cup! Footprint size is great for a tiny kitchen."
4,Great except for the shut-off feature,"This coffeemaker does a fine job in all respects except for one: that darn shut-off feature. I only use this on my days off, and whenever it's time to pour that second cup of the morning, the machine has shut down and the coffee is no longer hot. Popping the cup into the microwave for 30 seconds works, but it's annoying. The shut-off is a logical feature, especially for forgetful people like me, but could it have hurt to set the timer at, say, an hour?No problems with anything else: great tasting coffee, easy to work with, and brews quickly. Take your time pouring and you won't have any spills. Very simple to fill with water: no need to pre-measure."
4,This will be my second one and I really like it.,"I'm kind of bummed about the all the negative reviews to this brew maker and probably wouldn't have bought it if I hadn't already owned the black one for a few years now. Admittedly, pouring from the carafe is a bit of an issue but with the sink right next to the machine, I simply remove the lid and pour over the sink. I mean, don't you have to rinse the carafe anyway? I was/am excited to see this in pink and am looking forward to seeing every morning. It makes great coffee, is easy to use, and doesn't take up a lot of space. Yeah for the pink!"
2,Impossible to pour,"This coffeemaker is impossible to pour without spilling. We have been using it for about 6 months now, and one has to be a practical Zen Master to get the art of dribbling it out (not too fast, not too slow) in order to not get coffee all over the place.Now, if you were going to make a coffeemaker, don't you think that a standard thing like pouring coffee would be one of things that you'd pay attention to?I am disappointed in Cuisinart - I have always loved their stuff, but we are going to have to upgrade to a coffee maker without this fatal flaw."
3,With the good comes the bad,"My household only has 2 people so this coffee maker is perfect. I like the compact design that is sleek without screaming for attention. It makes great coffee and keeps it hot in the stainless carafe. I only have one problem with this coffee maker and its a big one. Big enough that it prompted me to send an email to Cuisinart. The carafe is poorly designed. There is a lip around the entire top of the carafe which catches coffee and does not allow for it to flow smoothly out of the too-small spout. As a result there is spillage all down the side of the carafe, along both sides of the too-small spout all over my countertop. EVERY TIME. I tried pouring slowly, I tried removing the lid of the carafe, to no avail. Ive now taken to just pouring it over the sink and wiping off the mug before setting it down. Its a shame because aside from this major annoyance its a great little coffee maker."
2,Unusable design,"The coffee itself turns out great, and it's plenty hot. The problem is trying to get the coffee in the cup. You cannot pour from the spout on the carafe. It will dribble, spill, and pour down the side of the container every time. It doesn't matter how slow/fast you pour or what angle you use. Overflow is a problem too, although I don't know how this happens as the pot isn't actually full. Did anyone at Cuisinart actually try to use this? I'd suggest a different brand."
1,hot plate coating peels off,Do not buy this coffeemaker. The tefelon coating peels off and Cuisinart requires $10 for shipping a new unit plus you must pay to ship old unit back.
1,Don't waste your money on this contraption.,"Horrible design. Coffee spills easily when poured from carafe, making a mess. Coffee pot doesn't stay on for very long, so if you'd like to leisurely sit and enjoy your coffee before getting the second cup, forget it. My coffee pot started to leak around the filter holder. The coffee dripped and burned on the heater, eventually rusting the heating element. The whole thing ended up in the trash after a year and a half. I don't know what Cuisinart was thinking when they gave this design a green light. I thought that I would get a quality coffee pot based on the name Cuisinart, but no. I won't buy one of their products unless I research it first."
2,fine if you don't mind having to pour each cup over the sink,"i've had this thing for about a year now. in general it gets the job done. but i have reached a breaking point with the constant mess this thing makes. a brain surgeon would not have a still enough hand to pour herself a cup without splashing coffee all over the place. i've taken to pouring my coffee over the sink. but really who can bear it? at first i thought maybe there's a hole in the carafe. i took a good look. no hole in the carafe. JUST A BIG FAT HOLE IN THE DESIGN. seriously. it splashes all over the place, wasting good coffee, soiling white shirts, dirtying the floors, running down the side of the mug, in general just wreaking havoc in the morning, a time that is stressful enough all on its own.i'm throwing mine out. maybe it's time to go back to the french press."
2,Reconsideration of old review,"After having owned this for over a year, I think my original review was overly enthusiastic. It seems that it would make more sense to just heat a couple cups of water and pour it through the coffee in a filter cone. Cleaning this little 2-cup appliance is not as easy as cleaning a kettle and a cup. There is no way to access the cavities where water remains after perking. Lifting up the lid during the percolation cycle is an invitation to an explosive scald. I think electric coffee makers are best for larger volumes."
1,Worthless junk,"Do not buy this. It is a worthless piece of junk. The carafe leaks coffee all over the counter. The auto shutoff is too short. I'd take it back, but I suspect they won't accept the pieces it's in now. Major mistake on my part, one I won't repeat. Don't buy this JUNK."
3,My hoped for coffee maker,"Studied all the reviews I could find on coffee makers and thought this one would meet all my needs.To start with I hate the snap on plastic lid that I have to pry off every morning. Then be sure your over the sink when you pour your coffee as it always spills some. I may be different but I use a timer to have my coffee ready when I get up. Due to a power switch I have never seen before this pot can't be used with a timer. Then I hate that the pot will only stay on for thirty minutes, sounds like the government looking out for us. And finally this may be personal but the coffee is never warm enough, I have to nuke it for a minute.But to look on the good side it makes great coffee."
2,terrible pouring,"3 of these and all have the same problem, you can't pour a cup without spilling. I cannot believe they would take such a great coffee maker and not resolve this."
1,Very dissatisfied,"I bought this for the office, believing that the stainless steel would be maintenance-free. Surprise! The carafe stains. The brew-pause feature stops working. It's almost impossible to pour anything from the carafe without dribbling. I called Cuisinart customer service and was told about the once a month regimen of brewing with vinegar, letting the vinegar brew sit for 40 minutes, then scrubbing with a bottle brush. When I rejected customer service's maintenance routine as too time consuming, I was referred to the retailer for to try to return it.Other coffee makers that I own or have owned worked very well with not more than once a year vinegar maintenance."
1,does not pour without dripping,"This coffee maker is nice looking and compact, but I can rarely pour a cup (either water into the machine or coffee out of the carafe) without dripping all over the counter. The feature where it stops brewing while you poor also does not work. Maybe ours is defective, but I wouldn't chance it."
2,Disappointed,The carafe drips as I pour water into the reservoir no matter what my method or how slow I pour. It's hard to pour all of the water or coffee out. The lid is not attached. But the bottom line is that it makes good coffee and an amount for a large travel mug.
2,Not What We Expected,"We are disappointed in this coffeemaker for the following reasons: Being unhappy that this 4-cup coffeemaker really makes only one mug of coffee, I called the company. Their representative told me that their standard for one cup is 5 oz., which means that to fill one mug you need to fill to their 3-cup marker. Also, the carafe is poorly designed making it impossible to get all of the coffee out, due to a plastic lip at the top of the carafe. This is also a problem when washing and rinsing - can't get all of the water out. The coffee is not hot enough even when used immediately after brewing."
2,Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker,"The Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker is poorly designed. The electric cord is so short that it must be positioned in front of an outlet to be plugged in. The most frustrating thing about it is that the heating element automatically turns off much too soon. Before I have finished my first cup of coffee, the second cup has cooled off while still in the pot. The lid must be pried off for cleaning. A little knob on top would have solved this problem. I always had a high opinion of Cuisinart products before this, but I don't now."
3,Cuisinart DCC-450BK 4Cup Coffeemaker with Stainless Steel,"I don't recommend filling the water all the way to 4 cups or it will clog itself and spill water out of the top during brewing. As long as you don't put more than three cups of water then you will have good results. The automatic turn-off works well. The craf must have the lid on when pouring water and/or coffee; otherwise, it will leak down the side of the craf all over. Its' ok for a 4-cup. It works. Just watch the water level and keep a lid on the craf!"
1,"A BIG ""ZERO""","I'd give this 4 - cup Cuisinart coffeemaker a big ZERO. The design flaw is inexcusable - it drips. The pour spout on the carafe is so tiny that you can not possibly pour a cup of coffee without dripping coffee on the countertop. Not only that, when you try to fill the reservoir - water goes everywhere. The little rocker on/off switch is hard to maneuver with one hand - you have to hold the machine down with one hand and turn the maker on with the other. Cuisinart can surely beat this!"
3,Need to eliminate auto shutoff.,"Makes great coffee, however I do not like the 30minute auto shutoff feature. Wish there was a way to void the shut off feature, or at least extend the time to 2 hours."
5,Kawieken,"I have 2 of these coffee makers, one at home and the other at work. They make coffee very quickly and it tastes great. I would recommend this coffee maker to everyone!"
2,If you don't mind your coffee and water everywhere,"This coffeemaker is wonderful for it's compact size, but that's about it. The lid on the pot does not fit well, and we are constantly pouring coffee and water all over the counter. No matter how careful I am, it still happens. It's defective or something. In addition, the on/off red light on the switch broke in short order. I would not recommend this coffeemaker, and now steer clear of all Cuisine Art coffeemakers. I wish I would have seen the other reviewers who had the same problems."
2,Wish I'd Read the Reviews,"I've loved every Cuisinart appliance I've owned until now. This coffeemaker is very attractive, but that's about it.I have yet to be able to pour water for brewing or coffee into my cup without spilling. I'm not careless and I've tried every which way, but it just doesn't work. The coffee is never hot enough. Also, it doesn't brew nearly as quickly as my 4-cup Mr Coffee did. And I could overlook those problems if it brewed a good tasting coffee, but it doesn't. Tried different coffees and varied amount of coffee used. Let's not forget to mention how inconvenient the on/off button is. Need 2 hands to manipulate.Oh yeah, the auto off works, but that just isn't enough to make me happy. Sorry I bought it. Would return it if I had kept the box, so looks like Goodwill has a Cuisinart 4-cup coffeemaker coming."
2,Strange Coffee Flavor,"I own a 12 cup Cuisinart coffee maker that makes delicious coffee. The 4 cup version is not equal to the task, for the flavor is metallic which seems to spoil the taste of the coffee. I would advise one to do a taste test on this model before purchasing."
5,Delightful!,"This is a perfectly delightful little coffee maker!! I've read in other reviews that it spills when pouring, well, my advice to those having that kind of trouble.....PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING! There was no spillage....and I poured about a dozen cups of coffee to make sure. I don't know, maybe some people prepare coffee while wearing oven mits. AND....if you can't see the red ""on"" light because you keep it in direct sunlight.....MOVE IT TO A SHADY SPOT ON THE COUNTER!!! Geez...c'mon people!!This coffee maker works fine, the coffee is tasty....I highly recommend it!!"
3,Good but not Great,"I selected this four cup coffee maker because of it's stainless steel carafe. I am enjoying using it but the lip on the carafe is so shallow that you must pour from it very slowly to avoid spilling. This is a problem because it takes a relatively long time to pour a cup of coffee or to set up the coffeemaker to make coffee. This might be great for a waitress trying to get a bigger tip but then a waitress wouldn't be using a four cup coffeemaker. But for someone trying to get a quick cup of coffee, it is a major inconvenience.The product could also use a permanent filter. I went online and was able to find a permanent filter from Cuisinart for under $10. It can also use #2 paper filters. After getting the permanent filter I decided it was a hassle to clean it out after each use. So I decided it was better to use the disposable paper filters with the permanent filter. But the paper filters can be used with or without the permanent filter."
3,Could be better,"Everytime I pour a cup of coffee, I think to myself ""I need to go write a review!"" because of spillage. I can't seem to pour it in the maker itself or into a cup without spilling water or coffee. It's a very cute coffee maker and it makes about 2 medium sized coffee mugs of coffee. It keeps the coffee hot and the sneak a cup works fine for me. Never upset about how it tastes or looks...just how it pours. So have a paper towel handy."
1,"I don't usually give negative reviews, but.....","This coffee maker annoys me enough that I will take the time to review it. I'm giving it one star simply because they don't allow any lower rating. My disappointment is because this is a Cuisanart, a brand I used to trust. I also like the idea of a stainless steel carafe that would not break the way my last glass carafe did. What I dislike most about the coffee maker is the stainless steel carafe for two reasons. It dribbles when you pour and it makes cold coffee and I have to let the coffee sit on the burner for 10 minutes after the brew is finished so it will be hot enough to drink after I put the milk in. I am glad they cut the price by 60% because at least it doesn't feel so much like I got ripped off by Cuisinart. In this price range there are half a dozen better coffee makers by other brands."
4,Sometimes small is better,"We just received the black one as a gift from my sis & her hubby. It's just my husband and I and the huge coffee maker we had was just to much. We are really liking this machine. We especially like the carafe. It is hard to put the water into it using the carafe but it was also hard to put the water into our big one. I solved that by using a measuring cup. So far we are not having a problem pouring the coffee from the carafe into a cup and it's very hot. I have to have my coffee very hot. With our other one, I had to microwave my coffee."
5,Great small coffeemaker!,"We have been using this daily for nearly 2 years, I am impressed, these things usually burn out by now."
2,Nice for a small desktop but not built to last,"Had this Cuisinart coffee maker for a year now. The coffee was fairly decent in quality compared to some its larger siblings from the same company, but the unit just isn't built to last. First, I had to return this item after a few months since the element stopped heating the hot plate at one point. Second, the plastic rim around the coffee pot now leaks when I try to pour from the pot. It used to take a steady hand to prevent spills before (very easy to do with this model). However, now it leaks not matter what since the sealant holding the plastic to the metal pot no longer holds up and leaks all the time. This after just under a year of use (I use the machine about 3 times a week at work)."
4,Unfounded criticisms,"I honestly can't see what the criticisms are about this coffee-maker. I have owned it for a month and have not experienced any of the water splashing/dripping issues noted by others. I didn't rate it a ""5"" because the ""auto-stop"" feature didn't work when I interupted the brewing to pour a cup, but to be fair there is a disclaimer in the manual that notes the feature may not work at certain stages of the brewing cycle. I also am not sure the measuring lines inside the carafe exactly line up with the water storage unit in the coffee-maker, but these are minor issues.Compared to the B&D; personal coffee-maker, this one is much more stylish and not as flimsy looking.Bottom line - if you want a good piping hot cup of coffee (or 2) brewed by a reasonably-priced stylish coffee-maker that doesn't take up much counter space, this is a great unit."
5,Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker - Best Ever,"This coffee maker is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Needed a replacement for a Melita 4-cup, which was perfect in every way, but no longer available. The Cuisinart performs even better and in heart friendly PINK. Lid comes off easily, size of pot is perfect for two BIG cups, or 4 small ones, and I like the automatic off feature. The stainless steel carafe takes the worry out of breaking it and having to find and buy a replacement. Thanks, Amazon...thanks Cuisinart. You have a new customer."
1,Hated it.,"The carafe isn't insulated, coffee is either cooked or cold. Jettisoned it after trying to make it work for me."
5,Great. Water reservoir poorly located,"This Cuisinart coffee maker rates 3 stars,not 4. The water reservoir is rather poorly located and it is difficult to add water. Reservoir is measured for 6 oz. cups. Should be 8 oz. Otherwise I like it very much. Amazon offers great selection of coffee makers."
3,Just Okay,"This is a good looking coffee maker but I am glad I didn't pay more than I did. Although the product claims to have a ""brew pause"" feature, it does not function that way. It also somehow leaks water onto the heat plate so it makes a sizzling noise while it brews."
4,"Great product, good for small kitchens!",I purchased this for my Mom as she has a very small kitchen. She loves the compact features while brewing a great cup of coffee each morning! Definitely worth the price.
2,Plan on using another carafe,"A decent coffeemaker, but the lid on the stainless carafeis a poor design. Pours more coffee on the counter than in your cup. I replacedthe stainless carafe with one from a Mr. Coffee and it is usable.Next time I'll just buy the Mr. Coffee."
4,Great little countertop convenience,"Love the design and utility of this cute little coffee maker. Also bought the perm gold filter which greatly improves flavor vs. using paper filters that absorb some of the oils. Nice rich taste using freshly ground beans, almost as tasty as using a French Press. Easy to fill and makes just the right amount for one person. Did not have the spillage/drip pouring problem as some other reviewers related but am from the ""slow and steady"" school of dealing with hot liquids while in the kitchen. ;-)"
3,Good not Great,"We were tired of breaking the glass carafes on our 4 cup carafe. We chose the Cusinart product because the many kitchen items we have, plus their great customer service made this a natural choice.We do not especially care for the cone filters on the smaller coffeemaker, nor are we happy with the internal display of water volume. I need a flashlight to check the water level.It does the job, but the two distractions make this choice simply O.K. Were it not for the stainless carafe it would be a pass."
1,it already has malfunctioned,I just bought it in January and it's malfunctioned to the point where I have to replace it. VERY dissatisfied.
1,Demitasse anyone ?,This is a good example as to what a coffee brewer should be not. The most disconcerting thing about this brewer is it supposed to be four cups brewing capacity. I use a 6 oz. Gavela cup and if I don't fill it a 1/2 inch from the top I get three cups of coffee. In my estimate the brewer is about 25% too small over all
1,Cannot pour a cup without spillage,"The one star comes from the carafe leaking when you pour coffee. Other than that, it's a bit slow, but makes decent coffee."
1,So it's not just us!,I am so glad we are not the only clutses who cannot pour a cup of coffee without dripping all over the counter. This coffee pot is the worst. We've only had it for a few months but we are looking to replace it already. I don't think we'll go with Cuisinart again.
2,NOT RECCOMENDED,"I own this product and do not reccomend it. The steam burns my hand when pouring. If I use the full 24 ounces, almost a half cup of hot coffee pours out the top of the pot onto the counter."
2,Disappointing,"If you are a coffee junkie, this coffee maker will disappoint you. There are several design features that are very anoying. The water resevoir is very hard to fill due to shape and top interference. The carafe drips. The coffee is not that hot."
1,Horrible..... Coffee Tastes Like Metal,And its hard to fill with water..... then the carafe spills while pouring.What a joke.DO NOT BUY !
5,Great little coffee maker,This is a great little coffee maker for 2 people. The coffee is excellent and it stores in a minimal space. It's perfect for our sailboat galley
1,Serious Design Flaws,"Three years ago, I purchased the black model for a lake cottage. It worked fine until two weeks ago when a critical plastic element broke. (Keep in mind, this was used seasonally, not daily for thee years.) Because I was so pleased with the black model originally, I purchased a white one for home. The carafe lip is slightly different, and all the reviews that describe it as dribbling or dripping when pouring are on target. It's a pain in the neck. The same design flaw is true of the red model which I purchased for our office. You cannot pour it without it dribbling down the side of the carafe, at least by the end of the pot. Don't waste your money."
4,Mike @ mays landing,Received order in record time. I have purchased Cuisinart coffeemakers and other products of Cuisinart and have always been completely satisfied with all my purchases. This purchase gave me the same satisfaction as all my other items. Keep up the excellent quality and pricing and you will have a return customer every time.
4,Great product,"This is a great product with a strong carafe. It is well priced,good quality, and a good value. The pink is a soft color just as the picture shows."
2,"Nice size, but spills and doesn't last long","After a mere 2 1/2 years of less-than-daily use, my Cuisinart DCC-450BK has brewed its last pot. It was a nice size for one person who drinks only one cup of coffee per day and it made decent-tasting coffee. However, I, too, had issues with it spilling water and coffee all over the place regardless of how careful I was. And two weeks ago it began shutting itself off after only a minute or two of brewing. Now it won't stay on for more than a second.I've gone out and purchased aBraun KF590E Impressions Digital 10-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker. Unfortunately, it's much larger, but brews a better-tasting cup of coffee. I'll be avoiding Cuisinart coffeemakers for the forseeable future."
4,COFFEE NOTES,"I purchased a four cup Cuisinart because I wanted a small coffeemaker. I like the red color, the size of the unit; however, the coffee doesn't stay hot in the stainless steel pot for very long( less than 30 minutes)."
2,The most poorly designed spout in the world!!!,I don't get how the artist who designed this made such a big mistake. The coffee pours all over the table and the cup. Ridiculous!!!
1,I change my mind,"I initially wrote a positive review of this product. I take it all back. It leaked coffee like crazy - the spring to ""steal a cup"" never worked, and I ended up cleaning up the counter more than cleaning anything else in the kitchen because of this coffee maker. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I have a Black and Decker and that works really well."
2,Spills!,I bought this small coffeemaker because I am the only one in my home who drinks coffee. I was so excited and impressed by its compact design! I have had it for about three months and 1/3 of the time it spills coffee ALL over. I find myself brewing more to compensate for the spillage that will inevitably occur.
2,Spills almost every time,"The coffee this maker makes is good, but the pot spills every time you pour. We have trained ourselves to pour over the sink. I even wrote to the company to let them know -- no response."
3,Carafe leaks,"I love this coffeemaker. It makes good coffee, but the carafe leaks just like others claim. I even called to complain anda new carafe was sent to me. I had to pay postage to return the old one. Guess what, the new one leaks just like the oneI returned. So I guess I live with it or find a heat proof sealer to fix it."
1,Drips Like Niagra Falls,"We wanted a small compact unit to cut down on our coffee consumption. While this fit the bill, its design has a few flaws that make it a pain to use. The pot lid does not fit correctly and drips all over the place when filling your cup. Makes it very incovenient as I have to wipe up spills constantly. The interior unit that houses the coffee filter does not rest securely in its seat so the lid never completely closes. More of an asthetic thing, but Cuisinart should have design engineers that would have spotted this. Hopefully this is an isolated incident, I tend to think it isn't so hence this review."
3,MAJ,"Have been using this for about one month, ever since my trusty Krups 4 cup cpffee maker finally gave out after 15 years. I reluctantly gave it three stars since it does make a fairly decent cup of coffee, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the coffee: 1) is not hot enough, 2)the half hour shut off is much too soon, 3) the coffee does not stay hot in the carafe, and, 4)the carafe almost always leaks all over the counter when you pour."
4,good purchase,"Looked a little smaller than imagined, but is a good product for our need. The only critiquethe lid is difficult to open should have a lip. The carafe, the firs item to break is metaland that is wonderful but of course you can't see what's inside.A good product a praise to the maker and to Amazon"
3,Cuisinart Coffe Pot,"Overall nice little pot, however the pause doesn't work. That is ok for my needs as it makes coffee pretty quickly. Drips a little when you pour too fast.Again most do. I love the size for my husband and I.Would buy again!!!"
3,And it rusts,"I agree with those who report that this coffeemaker generates delicious coffee and that the carafe drips. But what surprised me was that the hot plate rusts. I have several other devices with hot plates, and none of them rust, so I have to downgrade this one for that reason."
2,fresh aggravation with each morning cup,"I bought this coffee maker because it was one of the only four-cup makers I could find, and I have other Cuisinart appliances that I love. It does make good coffee. However, it spills, it sloshes, it makes an enormous mess. I pour it slowly, I pour it quickly, I pour it with the lid on and with the lid off the carafe- doesn't matter. I end up with water everywhere when I'm filling it up, and I end up with coffee everywhere when I'm trying to pour a cup. It's also nearly impossible to pour all the water into the reservoir - there's far too much lip on the carafe cover, and the angle is very awkward.If you do manage to end up with some coffee in your cup, it IS good, and it does stay very hot. I'm not sure that's worth the extreme irritation first thing each morning, though."
1,Huge Mess!,"I'm usually a huge fan of Cuisinart products, but was very disappointed with this coffee maker. Despite attempts to pour more slowly or with the carafe less than full, it leaks all over every time I pour a cup of coffee. The spout design is terrible, and my desk is now stained on top after only 3 months of use of this pot. I plan to replace it as soon as I can."
1,Keeps coffe hot--that's its only advantage--poor performance and quality.,Purchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it. The heating plate under the pot started to rust; the pot leaks every time it's poured; it's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water. We purchased this unit because of the Cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe. We will not purchase another.
3,Cuisinart 4-Cup Coffeemaker,"Aesthetically it is great. Functionally it is a little cramped to load water, then filter and coffee. 30 minute warming feature is great as when it shuts off you know the coffee is dead! Caraffe is tricky to wash and empty as rim won't let last bit of coffee/water out easily. Stainless caraffe is nice, but does limit ability to see how much coffee is left. All in all, it is a great addition to kitchen, but could not say it is the best one I have ever had. Temp of coffee is good, and tends to brew on the strong side. Ceramic heater base is good design."
4,once you get over the feeling that you are in a hotel room...,I decided to downsize from my 12 cup krups since i rarely make more than 2 cups of coffee. it was a delightful surprise to see that the coffee was nice and hot in the smaller carafe than it had been with the larger coffee maker.
4,carafe leaks!,"The coffeemaker makes excellent coffee, but pouring is a bit of a challenge. I can't figure out whether there is a leak in the carafe or if there is a design flaw in the spout; it drips while pouring. If there is a replacement carafe available that does not leak, I would like to know where to get it."
4,"WELL, It's a good coffee maker, BUT","Yes I say it is a good coffeemaker nice color workes great except for it shuts off too early, and I have to put LOT'S AND LOT'S of coffee in it to get a strong cup of coffee and if you happen to put alittle to much water in it, it will leak through a over flow hole in the back of the tank, kind of dumb if you ask me. I will be buying a new, like my old one a Mr. Coffee blk 4 cupper or white one"
2,Lousy coating,I've only had this coffee maker for a few months and already the coating on the surface that the pot sits on is flaking. There's a big bare metal spot that is constantly growing in size.I must say that it does make fair coffee and I haven't had the spillage problems that others have had.It does seen to be cheaply make. The pot seems to me to be made of aluminum rather than stainless steel.But I am really concerned about the heating and safety as the coating continues to peel off.
2,Should have listened to the negative reviews.............,"I would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone. The coffee does taste funny and I didn't realize it might be the metal pot. Also, DO NOT pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out. Just like one of the other reviewers said, the pot does not slide in and out easily. Not a coffeemaker I would recommend. The only thing I like about it is the size!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible product!,"I bought one of these a few years ago thinking it would be nice to have the unbreakable carafe. This is without a doubt the worst coffee maker I have ever owned. I would have returned it, but could not find my receipt. Carafe leaks around the rim, the pause and pour feature does not work most of the time. I have a Krups and broke the glass carafe, but I would not buy anything from Cuisinart again."
1,Coffee is great. The carafe is terrible!,"Do not buy this coffee pot unless you enjoy wiping up spill when you pour from the pot. I use this in my office and I wipe up water after I pour it in the coffee maker, and I wipe up coffee when I pour it in the cup. What a disappointment."
1,drippy mess,Horrible design. You cannot pour coffee without having it drip all over the counter. The carafe has a rim around the inside that makes it impossible for the coffee to pour correctly. Another example of a company making a product without testing it. Don't buy it. There are plenty of other coffee makers.
1,Slow and inconvenient,"This coffee maker is exactly like the ones found in cheap motels, but with the Cuisinart name slapped on it, and a stainless steel carafe instead of glass. One cannot see how much coffee is in the carafe, and there is no window showing how much water is in the coffee maker. Switching it on takes two hands -- one to hold the machine, the other to press the switch. It is also very slow -- seven or eight minutes for a nearly full 4-cup carafe. Not recommended -- and I notice there are more 1-star than 5-star reviews."
1,Bummer brew,"I bought this little guy for work, and, though it swiftly brews wonderful-smelling coffee, the flavor is just plain off. I don't know if it's the steel carafe (I've used only glass carafes before) or if there's something screwy with the way the coffee brews, but the flavor is flat out disappointing. Someone suggested in another review that the coffee's flavor has a plastic tinge, and it may be that, I guess. Coffee reacting with something else. Chemical. Unpleasant. I'm buying a replacement. Oh, and the lid leaks! Hold the carafe and your cup over the sink or a garbage can so you don't dribble coffee on your carpet or toes."
1,Discontinued product still being sold...,"Everything that has been written about this product is accurate from my experience:Pros:-Cheap-Small footprint-Makes coffee fastCons:-This product is discontinued (as I found out when I called Cuisinart regarding the next point)-The plastic part of the carafe is poorly made, so a week after I purchased it, the lid started to leak, which leads to the messy counter issues when pouring that everyone is complaining about in the reviews-Poor design: the steam from the spout could burn you as you are pouring a cup due to the angle it's at.I'm surprised Cuisinart has not recalled this product, it actually seems like a hazard and potential lawsuit."
3,Cuisinart DCC-450 4-cup coffeemaker,Brews a great cup of coffee. The cover of the carafe is difficult to open. I wish the auto turn-off was set for a longer period. I can't drink 4 cups of coffee in half an hour. I found a little insulated carafe in a yard sale and use it to keep the coffee hot. Wish I had searched more thoroughly for one with an insulated carafe before buying this one.
1,Back to Mr. Coffee,"My experiences parallels the 1-Stars reviews. I called Cuisinart customer service, they sent me a new 4 cup coffee-maker, and I experienced - all over again - every stupid, drippy malfunction. Cuisinart charged me $5.00 to ship me the replacement and I had to pay $7.33 to send the old one back to them. Never did the customer service rep say anything vaguely apologetic. I am done with it."
2,Not worth the money,"I've only had this thing for a few weeks, but I don't like it already. I agree with the others that the carafe is flawed. I can't pour slowly enough to keep coffee from getting all over my counter.I also don't like the fact that it's not really ""thermal"". It does shut off after the coffee is brewed, and it rapidly gets cold. The first cup is fine, but the second is always lukewarm. I don't want to have to zap my coffee in the micro because it's not hot enough for me.I'll be offering this thing up on Freecycle for someone else to have fun with and buy another one."
2,Leaks after 3 months,Loved the cuisinart products. I use the food processor and the cookware. This cuisinart coffee maker started leaking after only 3 months!
5,My new Cuisinart 4-cup coffeemaker,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that the new model of this coffeemaker doesn't dribble when pouring the water into the coffeemaker. That was the only real objection I had to the last Cuisinart 4-cup coffeemaker. I recommend it highly. In addition the cord is much shorter, which is also better since a long cord was totally unnecessary."
2,Faulty decanter,After using for less than two weeks I noticed that coffee was leaking. From between the metal part of the decanter and the black plastic on the top just under the pouring spout. I was very disappointed I thought I was getting a deal at the price and it turns out I got robbed at half the price. I have bought other Cuisnart coffee pots and they all were great this one sucks.
1,"Terrible, Horrible, Piece O Crap Carafe","The carafe on this thing sucks. It boils the coffee, it leaks when you pour it, water doesn't completely drain from the carafe after it's been washed. I hate it. I'm getting to throw the whole unit in the trash and get a replacement."
1,Cuisinart should be ashamed,"I have never before submitted a product review, but I am so angry that I am submitting this one today!This coffee maker is terrible. The shape of the spout is designed badly ... so that coffee dribbles down the side of the carafe. Every time you pour coffee, you need to grab a sponge to wipe the counter and the bottom of the cup. Unbelievable.Plus, it doesn't get the coffee hot enough ... so that, after pouring a cup of coffee, you need to put the coffee in the microwave for 20 seconds.I will be very suspicious of Cuisinart products in the future."
1,Coffee Maker not worth buying!,Every time you pour the brewed coffee it drips all over the counter plus just filling the water container to make the coffee is cumbersome. Not worth buying at all.
1,Do not recommend!,"I do not recommend this coffee pot! I have a really small kitchen in a studio with very limited counter space, so when I saw this, it looked like the perfect solution! Compact, made just enough coffee and looked nice... BUT boy am I disappointed! I noticed a lot of others on amazon and BB&B have similar complaints about it leaking everywhere, the water pumping into the basket too quickly and overflowing the edges of the filter, grounds in the pot, and the stainless steel carafe is not insulated (I can't believe how fast the coffee gets cold!) I am just waiting for this to die so I can go buy a Mr. Coffee 4-cup digital (It didn't make it with me on my last move but I loved that one!)"
2,"Looks good, but poor design","I bought this coffee maker because of the compact size and it looked nice with the stainless steel carafe. I've been using it for about 10 months now:Pluses:Looks nice, brews hot coffee very quickly.Minuses:Since it brews coffee very fast, the coffee doesn't steep as long in the filter, I found you actually need MORE coffee grounds to make a comparably strong pot of coffee compared to my old Mr. Coffee maker, which let the coffee drain slower.The carafe drips all over the place when you're pouring. I kept thinking the lid was on wrong but it does, in fact, dribble like a joke. I see many other people are complaining about the same poor design.The stainless steel carafe makes it difficult to see how much coffee is left. And although it looks like it's one of those insulated carafes, it is not.As a ""safety"" feature, the coffee maker turns itself off automatically after only 15 minutes. This would be fine (and expected) if it was an insulted carafe."
2,Carafe Drips,"Received this coffee maker for my birthday. It basically does what it is designed to do and more. The ""and more"" part is the dripping of coffee on the counter and the dribbling of the coffee to the bottom outside of the carafe with subsequent transfer to the hot plate. I have tried pouring ever so slowly, stuck my tongue out the right side and left side of my mouth while pouring to no avail. The really sad thing is that I just saw a GE 4 cup coffee maker, the exact same design, sans the metal carafe, for $10 at Walmart. Buyer beware."
2,A mixed bag,"When the coffee maker first arrived, my wife loved the way it looked. The red and stainless steel are a nice change from the typical black or white plastic, and the small footprint was an asset in a small kitchen. However, a number of shortcomings have become evident. The design of the carafe is flawed: you can't pour out all the coffee without removing the cover. The black rubber feet leave marks on the counter. The light on the on/off switch is impossible to see in direct sunlight, and the rocker switch is annoying on its own merits. I wouldn't purchase this again, and my experience with other Cuisinart products has been disappointing. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find a well-designed four cup coffee maker at any price."
4,A Solid Buy,"Nice looking; goes with my urban loft. The downside to the stainless carafe is that you can't see the coffee in the pot while you're making it, so you have to guess when it's done based on the drip sounds (or lack thereof), though there is a handy drip-pause feature. Also, the carafe-top clips in instead of opening with a lever so you can't peek into the pot easily. The upside is that it's much easier to maintain than a glass carafe...you don't get that impossible to remove sludge accumulating on the bottom if you accidentally leave it on for too long or forget to wash the carafe one morning. As far as the coffee goes, you get what you pay for: of course it's not as good as what a Bunn/other high-end machine would produce, but it's smooth-tasting and good for the average coffee-lover."
5,Great little maker for a great price,"I recently took a chance and purchased this item. I had read some discouraging reviews, but I am more than pleased. Although it is a 4-cup maker, it is great for an office or a smaller family home. It is a great space saver on the counter, cleans up nicely and makes excellent coffee. The stainless steel carafe cleans easily and looks great. I haven't found any adverse tastes due to a stainless steel carafe as opposed to glass. It definitely gets the job done quickly and easily, and looks good in the process. Highly recommend!"
2,Makes coffee taste like you licked a 9-volt battery,"I've had this coffee maker for about three months...and yes all the things people complain about are true: hard to poor, spout drips, condensation on the flip cover, messy, etc. But to be fair all coffee makers (or any appliance for that matter) have their little nuances. I could forgive all of these shortcomings but what I can't forgive is the taste. The coffee taste like it's been in a stale rusty canteen for six months. From the very first cup the metal taste obliterates any subtle flavors the coffee has. I assume it is a result of a stainless carafe that is not lined with glass. I (or my wife) am in no way a coffee snob but we can't stand that metal taste. I don't understand why more people haven't addressed this issue in their reviews. We are looking to replace this machine ASAP.Otherwise, general quality is quite good. I think if we could replace the carafe with a glass one this would be a good little coffee maker."
1,Not up to standard,"I just returned this coffee maker, because the spring on the bottom of the drip unit did not operate properly. The coffee would sit in the grounds basket and not filter down into the carafe. I had 2 previous models that failed in the same manner so I believe there is a design flaw and I am disappointed that Cuisinart does not make a better product."
3,"so, so coffee maker","I like this coffee maker, but the carafe doesn't pour too well. There are alot of dribbles and drips. My husband makes the coffee in our home and he does not like it, that is why I am writing the review."
2,On the side of those who say it is not a quality coffee maker.,"I love Cuisinart appliances...normally. This is bit of a disappointment. It does leak when you pour no matter what. It comes out of the spout and also around the rim where the pink plastic meets the stainless steel. For those who say theirs does not leak, they lucked out and got a good seal around the rim. We will try to fix it and see how it works then. It is okay if you drink coffee fast, but that is not me. I will stick with my Mr. Coffee coffee maker for now. This is a cute, but not so worthwhile appliance."
3,Pour Slowly,"Don't ask me about the taste, I just make it and drink it and it's coffee. But the reason I am writing the review is because the design of the pot itself was not thought out well. If you don't pour the coffee rediculously slow, you will have coffee dripping off the bottom. If you're impatient like me, get one that pours faster. Another minor thing is that you cannot empty the pot completely. The plastic rim makes it impossible to empty all of the coffee. But otherwise, I am not looking to replace it anytime soon."
3,The design didn't work for us,"We keep our coffee maker on a counter under the cabinets. Every other coffee maker we had has a separate lid for the coffee and for the water so lifting each one is easier. This one has one very long lid for both so we couldn't really lift it and get enough clearance under the cabinet.Also, while you can lift out the receptacle that holds the coffee to wash it, you can't remove the casing like on all other coffee makers I've had. So I could see this getting dirty and yucky tasting after a while"
3,Functional but the coffee is not hot enough,I needed a basic small coffeemaker for work. I bought this one at a discounted price at Amazon. I think it is a decent machine. My biggest complaint is the coffee is not hot enough and the core is very short. I will buy something a little nicer next time.
1,Worst coffee maker ever!,"This was a total waste of money; after struggling with it for a month I have thrown it away and bought a new one. The hot water boiling through the filter spills over carrying grounds both into the coffee in the carafe and all over the kitchen counter, the carafe is badly designed and spills every time it is used, I could go on but can't be bothered. Do yourself a favour and get a different coffee maker."
2,Disappointed with Cuisinart,"This should have been ideal. Right size, good brand name, cone filter, stainless steel...It brews 4 six ounce cups in 8 minutes, which gives you a weak brew.The stainless steel carafe is very hot and when I held the handle and my knuckles touched the carafe, OUCH!Don't remove the carafe until all four cups are brewed or the filter will drip.I expected more from Cuisinart. I was disappointed."
1,"Very bad design, cannot pour coffee without spilling almost as much as gets to the cup.","Very poor design, spills as much as hits the cup. the brewer part seems ok but it's just not worth the hassle. Mine is going into the trash this week, money down the drain (or into the landfill)."
3,A little disappointed,"I wanted a small 4-cup coffeemaker and was unable to find one in the small town where I live. The Cuisinart DCC-450R Coffeemaker is the small size I needed; however, the plastic parts to this product are very light weight and this product looks to be very cheaply made. I know I did not pay a lot for this coffeemaker; however, it is not as good as the free coffee maker I received from Gevalia several years ago which finally died and had to be replaced. I really don't care for the stainless steel carafe either; I like to be able to see my coffee and would have much preferred a glass carafe. The coffee made with this product is good, but I use good coffee and expected no less. I just feel like this is another instance of our ""throw-away"" mentality - buy it cheap, use it a short time and then throw it away."
5,Dripless Pour,"Length:: 0:20 MinsI actually find the dripless pour easy, a better pour than a Krups (no auto shut-off) and a Hamilton Beach (burned out after 2 years). I can make it spill, however, by tipping the carafe much too steeply. A problem for those in a morning rush, but not for the mellow. Everything else is to like. As others point out, it turns off in 30 minutes (says so on the box). I find this a plus, as the coffee never burns, and I can leave the house without that worry. For others, the second cup may need to be reheated.Bottom line: For some, another morning annoyance, but for the mellow soul who doesn't like burned coffee, or out-of-house worry, this is a gem. The dripless pour will be natural for some."
1,Coffee is good if you like the taste of plastic chemicals,Length:: 1:08 MinsOur review of the Cuisinart 4 Cup Coffee maker with Stainless Steel Carafe and our Experience with Cuisinart Customer Service
2,Dribbles,"Makes great coffee, brews fast. Dribbles when pouring. Have to pour over the sink and clean up the pot and cup. Would not recommend because of this."
3,"Nice product, but not perfect.","I first used this coffeemaker while on a visit to my sister, who was very pleased with it. The coffee it made was consistently good, so on my return I purchased one.My experience with it was marred by the infamous spillage problem while pouring the coffee. Sometimes it was OK and sometimes not, but I finally realized that the slightest lack of tightness in securing the top onto the pot would cause a leak--e g a tiny coffee ground. So the answer is scrupulous cleanliness and pressure on the lid to secure it well. The reason for a 3-star rating is the question of whether a manufacturer should put such stringent requirements on a thin piece of plastic.The coffeemaker keeps the water in contact with the grounds just the right amount of time for may taste, so finally I am quite pleased to have excellent coffee from an attractive little system."
3,Mixed Emotions,"This little coffee maker makes an excellent cup of coffee. Unfortunately, it also has a couple of detractions. First, the auto shutoff feature will turn the machine off in about 25-30 minutes after you turn it on. Since it takes time to brew, you only have about 20 minutes until you get lukewarm coffee. Second, the carafe design is absolutely horrible and will dribble when pouring coffee on occasion. I cannot stress enough how much of an annoyance this is. Did the designers forget to test the final product? How hard is it to design a spout that contains the coffee while pouring?If all you care about is a good cup of coffee, then by all means go ahead and get this coffee maker. I have no qualms about its coffee making prowess. Its design, however, leaves much room for improvement."
2,Leaks when pouring,I've actually been silly enough to have gone through two of these. They look great on the counter of my small kitchen and the coffee is just fine. Unfortunately I've tried just about everything under the sun to keep the carafe from leaking and dribbling when pouring coffee and it is impossible.
2,Leaks and more,"It makes good coffee, but the pot leaks no matter if you pour fast or slow and the function for pouring a cup during brewing doesn't always work, even if you've cleaned it perfectly.Also - the coffee isn't hot enough for someone who adds milk - I always have to microwave the coffee after brewing it.Otherwise it's perfect!It looks good, is easy to clean and makes good coffee."
2,Spills and drips are guarranteed with this thing,"This coffee makes makes good coffee and is (almost) well designed.However the design for pouring is industrial strength BAD. You can count on it always dripping and making a mess. I would think that Cuisinart could design a carafe that doesn't drip, but this is not it. It always drips, so if you get this, count on always pouring over the sink. Just a bad design really. The plastic ring around the top of the carafe allows coffee to drip down the side every time."
1,Broke within the first month!!,"I was really excited about this coffeemaker, until it broke after we used it to make 1 carafe M-Fr for about 4 weeks straight. So, in hindsight, it appears that this coffeemaker is probably ok for ""light"" use, but not ok if you plan on drinking coffee daily."
5,Regular Guy,"I like this coffee maker a lot. I don't mind the lip around the carafe, and don't mind not being able to see through the carafe - actually I wanted a steel carafe because I was sick of always breaking the thin glass ones. As far as dripping goes, the trick is to pour SLOWLY at first. If I do this it doesn't drip, if I pour too fast it does drip. For $22 I think this is a perfect coffee maker."
2,"Makes coffee, but spills all over creation.","I like that this makes four cups of coffee, and it is REALLY easy to use. I just HATE the fact that when you pour your coffee the darn thing ALWAYS spills. So fed up with it I am now looking for a new coffee maker. Would not recommend."
2,MESSY MESSY MESSY,I cannot believe all the positive reviews this coffeemaker gets. I've had it for 5 months now & I hate it. It was a gift from my mom so I feel obligated to use the blasted thing.It is impossible to pour either into the maker or into my mug without massive spillage. Hate this stupid thing. Cuisart should be ashamed to make such a lousy coffee pot.
2,Guzzle or else...,"I bought a 4 cup coffee maker because I live alone. I appreciate many of the features of this Cuisinart coffee maker, but one of them is ridiculous. The coffee maker is equipped with a auto-shut-off. that's fine...but I can never get to my second cup of coffee because the darn thing has shut itself off and the coffee is cold. I enjoy a slow, relaxed cup of coffee. I think having an auto-shut off is fine but it should be set to give one enough time to have his/her 2 cups of coffee."
1,bad choice,This unit lasted a little over a year. Has an aluminum pot that is hard to pour out of....slobbers all over the place even with the lid intact. I would never buy another one.
2,"good coffee, terrible design","although this little machine brews good coffee, the design is awful. the carafe drips terribly when pouring (i lose probably 1 cup of brewed coffee due to dripping), and the water compartment is awkward to fill."
1,Poorly Designed,"The only redeeming feature of this Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker is the sleek black and silver design. After that, it rapidly goes downhill. It is frustratingly difficult to pour water from the carafe into the chamber unless it's done extremely slow and with accurate positioning. Even then, water still tends to dribble out and create a mess. The lid, itself, is VERY poorly designed with it's molded, round ""grip"" to supposedly remove the lid from the carafe. The only way I can remove it is to insert a sharp pointed object into one of the front pouring holes and pry it off! I've also occasionally had a problem with the water not filtering down through the grounds, creating a coffee ground lake in the upper chamber and a mess below. I think the designer should go back to the drawing-board for this one."
1,under performer,"The stainless steel carafe is all but completely useless. Must pour over the sink because you're likely to spill more that pour. And there's no apparent advantage to the stainless, so you're probably better off with a glass carafe which will come cleaner with a simple rinse. Needless to say, i'm disappointed."
2,Died so young,This made good coffee while it worked. It's hard to find a good 4 cup coffee maker. But it died after two years of light use and that's inexcusable. My previous cheapo K-Mart coffee maker lasted for almost ten years.
1,Not good,"I wanted a nice 4 cup coffee maker. This does not do the job. The coffee is not great, it is ok. The caraf drips down the side when you pour. The coffee does not stay warm and it turns off after 1/2 hour."
1,Terrible design & the carafe leaks.,"Purchased this coffee maker a few weeks ago and hate it.1) Very small capacity, barley enough for 2 average sized mugs of coffee.2) The carafe leaks terrible between the metal and plastic surround. I'm working with Cuisinart now to get a replacement. Not sure how that will work out, so I can't comment on their response. This appears to be a fairly widespread issue with this carafe.3) Electrical chord should be longer.4) Small but stupid design error. The on/off button is hard to push so you have to hold the coffee maker still in order to push it.5) There are far too many better designed coffee makers in this price range to chose this one."
4,Nice coffee maker,"I'm currently a collegs student living in an apartment with other roomates. This is an excellent coffee maker to fit my needs. I can easily put it away into a shelf once I'm finished with it. It makes descent coffee. It's not some miracle machine that's going to somehow make the coffee taste better than its meant to taste. But it doesn't destroy the coffee either. I find that I can use less coffee in this than my roomates machine to make the same amount of coffee with the same desired strength, and I like it fairly strong. All in all, it makes 2 coffee mugs worth of descent coffee (as long as your grounds are descent.)"
5,Never fails me,"I am so glad Brother still makes this. My p-touch must be close to 10 years old now, still works perfectly. The labels are easy to use. The type is very sharp, and the sticky backing actually sticks but is easy to take off if necessary."
2,Not so clear,The label is a bit cloudy on the jar as compared to the other clear labels I have used.
4,Sony Cassette Player,"This is a great little gadget. My only problem with is that is does not stop automatically when it comes to the end of side two. It continues to play until it is manually switched off and if you forget about it, it will eventually chew up the tape."
1,Poorly made,"A disappointment. Sony quality has certainly changed. Sound poor, many of the bands do not come in at all."
4,The Further Tales of Sulley and Company.,"SCREAM FACTORY FAVORITES is a compilation of songs sung by Riders in the Sky about the characters from MONSTERS, INC. Most of the songs dive a little further into the characters from the movie, while a few just play on some of the characters' familiar characteristics. Most of the songs have a 50s do-wop feel, and not much country twang. There are 13 songs on the cd and the running time is about thirty-five minutes. I've played some of the songs on the web-radio show I host and will probably continue to do so in the future. My favorite songs on the album include:""I Only Have Eye For You""""Monsters, Inc. March""""Paperwork"" (Roz's Song)""The Perfect Roar"" (Sulley's Song)This is a cd that most kids will enjoy and makes a nice gift for any fan of MONSTERS, INC."
4,Monster Scream-A-Long,"Following the formula of their previous CD for PIXAR (Woody's Roundup), the Riders in the Sky have created music that extends the story and characters of Monsters, Inc. beyond the film. Staying true to the film though, the music mostly stays away from country and tries for a more 50's doo-wop feeling. Their harmonies work just as good in this style as country and it's good to hear them trying new things. But don't think this is a radical departure because it isn't. We're talking shading here.If you enjoyed the film (and who didn't) then you're sure to be won over by this CD. Kids and adults alike will enjoy the catchy tunes and clever lyrics (""I love to take you dancing and sweep you off your tentacles"") which are included in the booklet so you can learn them and sing along. My only complaints are the annoying song LULLABY FOR BOO (the only song not sung by Riders) and the too short running time of 33 minutes."
3,Confusing,"The Riders in the Sky are fantastic here as they are on the Woody's Roundup CD but they have an old time western sound to them, and this CD is music from MONSTERS, INC. It was a little confusing for my boys (ages 3 and 2) because they kept telling me they wanted to hear MONSTERS, not WOODY. Fun music, though."

3,Handles Could be Better Made,"I bought this set of handles because I needed another pair for my Tower 2000 workout gym. These were the only ones I could find online and at Amazon. I received them in a very timely manner even though I live overseas on a military installation. The shipping and timely delivery was great!I used them twice and noticed that the outside edges of the foam handles were beginning to fray. This is a result of the nylon straps rubbing against the foam padding when you do things like bicep curls or any other exercise that involves the handles moving but the padded foam handle remaining still in your hands.I was very disappointed that this was the case and expected a better made handle. If Perform Better had made the foam padding a little shorter than the actual length of the handle, then there would be no problem. My solution was to actually use a scalpel knife and trim the edges of the foam myself so there's no rubbing. I should now get years of workouts out of these handles."
2,A Better Group,"Although they are good, they only have one original song on their CD. I must say that Jackie T and the Rhythm Jesters far surpases any of the so-called ""oldie"" groups around. They have a new CD coming out that is all originals, but maintains the sound of the 50's. Look for it coming out in Sept. '06."
1,"This is Folk music, not doowop!","If you are a true doowop fan like I am, 1955-1965, you will not appreciate this phony junk. This group looses all connection in the recording studio, but comes a little closer when they perform live. But not much. Dont waste you're money."
4,Modern-day India is memorably described.,"Ms. Peters does a wonderful job of describing modern-day India in this book. It's easy to tell that she often visited there and loved it. India is teaming with life and with colours. In this book we have Dominic and his girlfriend Tossa acting as chaperones to deliver a young girl to her Indian father. Once there they find themselves in a whole bunch of trouble. Their job of delivering their young charge becomes very complicated when she goes missing. Tossa and Dominic are then racing against time in a strange country in order to try to get her back. Ms. Peters' characters in this book are wonderfully drawn, and the story is a wonderful journey to a wonderful country."
3,Stick to Cadfael,"I'm really not enamored of any of Peters' non-Cadfael books. They're written well enough, but I find myself more often than not bored by them. I had hoped for better in this mystery set in India, but didn't find it. As a favor to his girlfriend Tossa's mother, Dominic Felse agrees to chaperone a young teenage girl and deliver her to her father in India. Once there, however, they discover that he is missing and are at a loss as to what to do with her. Then she is kidnapped and they must find a way to get her back. The story was interesting but fell a little flat, even to the end, and I could not relate to any of the characters. I'll stick to Cadfael."
5,Highly underrated author,This is one of my favorite series of all time and Corfe is one of my favorite characters. Paul Kearney writes some of the most emotionally charged scenes I've ever read. Do yourself a favor and buy The Monarchies of God series.
4,Excellent !,"This is a very readable book. I am sure after I have read the other two, the series will be one of my favorites.The only thing I can compare it to is Asimov's Foundation. While not as deep, and the conclusion of the series more certain, there is more than enough suspense and much more action.The writing style is visually and aurally descriptive and stimulates the imagination.I`ll definitely be getting all the others in this series."
3,Tastes of Inspiration,"As with the series itself, the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles soundtrack captures the mood of the early 20th century. Young Indy, Soundtrack Volume 3, captures the rich variety of Gershwin and exposes the listener to the beginnings of jazz and the blues. Most viewers didn't get the vision Lucas was creating with the series, opting and hoping for the action and thrills provided by its big screen adult counterpart. Musically, the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and particularly Voulume 3 doesn't disappoint in its evocative themes and tastes of inspiration...."
5,Quality and Fun,"Neufeld presents a set of children's toys of extremely high quality that are fun to build. And, my grandkids play with them for hours. I believe the book describes how to make heirlooms. I highly recommend this for any woodworker."
5,Real educational toys,"I like this book and its projects. This book has toys that will stimulate the thinking processes and be enjoyed for years. These may take some time to make for a beginner woodworker, but a breeze for an experienced one. But, I'm going to enjoy the fact that all my grandchildren will be stimulated to be creative and thinking critically."
5,Rewarding project,"I found this book by chance and was smitten. I love woodworking and we have 2 small grandsons. We have just completed the blocks project and yes it did take time, but that was the most expensive item. We had enough scrap (!) to complete them all. Mr Neufeld recommends Varnish Oil, but I used Howards Butchers Block Conditioner, also available from Amazon. It is completely non toxic and great to apply, softens hands nicely. I think our boys will love them. Their father has architectural training and there may be competition for the blocks. Great book. Highly recommended if you like working with wood. I also made the domino tiles a few years ago and they were a great success."
3,Secret Lives of the U.S. Presidents,"So far so good, gives new insights to who the presidents were and things that I did not now about America"
4,secret lives of the US presidents,"This book was wonderful for the history junkie in me. A real eye opener into the past. A huge amount of our past presidents were in my opinionborderline CRAZY! I also read the book about our past First Ladies. Some of them could have used some serious medications. They allendured some serious hardships in their lives. i.e. loss of family, being married to powerful men, illnesses. My last thought, some of our presidents let themselves be manipulated by people with wealth and not in a good way."
2,Secret Lives of American Presidents,I expected a lot more information on the presidents...I seemed to be aware of all the info given. There were no revelations which was disappointing...just a rehash of what we already knew.#
4,Looking for dirt on PA Avenue,The book went slow in the beginning and increased in content and detail as the anecdotes became more contemporary. There were several new sexual dalliances that were not common knowledge...Entertaining and fulfills its title.l
2,Disappointing and juvenile,"I was disappointed in both the content and the writing of this book. I found little information about our presidents that is not already generally known and otherwise widely published. I was also extremely distracted by the author's immature and sophomoric ""asides"" which were many, and which only took the book from a literary account, down to a mediocre, extended gossip column."
3,Interesting,"Short, sweet synopsis about each president. As a history teacher, having these little stories are great to teach beyond what's in the textbook and create something of a nugget to takeaway from learning. Little tidbits are always great to file in the back of your head and this book is great for that foundation. I suggested this book to my Washington DC tour guide. Saw her the following year and she totally loved it."
4,Get the dirt on our past leaders.,"Wanna know the dirty little secrets of our presidents? This is the book. With 5 or 6 pages on each guy, every president has some tidbits of bad press on them. You know about Bill Clinton, Nixon and JFK. Now you can snark at Taft, FDR and even Lincoln.This book is a light but fun read. It's style is light hearted and irreverant. Hey, Presidents are human, too, you know."
4,President's Lives,As a teacher I have enjoyed this book very much because it gave me the opportunity to add interesting tidbits to my classes.
1,interesting but one sided,I read about the presidents that were in office during my life and I can see a very strong lean to the Democratic presidents. I don't expect their problems to be over looked but I think that the republican presidents were made to look like drunks and etc while the democratic ones were glossed over and made to sound so impressive that their problems were not important.
1,Extremely liberal bias,This book is ridiculously bias. Don't bother buying it unless you are very liberal. Could be a fun book if it didn't mock the conservative presidents and support the liberal ones.
5,I am so happy I read this,Amazing. I have learned the most interesting facts of the presidents of our time. Book filled with funny and historical facts.
3,A bit boring,"While not an awful book, this book is not for experts on the Presidency or voracious readers of American history. Most of what is written (although not all), is not terribly secret or otherwise known. Also, there are a fair number of repetitions in the text, where part of something is written, then abandoned, and then written again two or three paragraphs later, like it was never referred to before. There are a few grammatically questionable sentences throughout, and some run on sentences which make it occasionally difficult to read. However, for younger readers, and those who are not voracious readers of American history, this book will do nicely."
2,Too conversational,"The author tries very hard to be amusing and conversational.Some of the ""secrets ""are very trivial.More History and less fluff would be an improvement,"
4,Very interesting,"A very enjoyable and enlightening read. I'm definitely planning to read it, or at least parts of it, again. Definitely recommended."
3,Informative book but not very interesting.,"When you think of secret lives of the the president you want to know all the dirt. Unfortunately this book does not deliver that. Very informative about details on the presidents that are not widely known, but not as interesting as I had hoped."
4,Not an academic work,"The book was very entertaining, but could have been written in a more professional manner. I found it interesting that one could have gotten a ""Cliff's Notes"" version by reading only the highlighted ""boxes."""
2,Lasted 6 months,"This was an authentic Toshiba power adapter, but it only lasted 6 months. The original adapter lasted a couple of years. The cord it came with was very short so we just used the original power supply with the new adapter and everything worked until now. I just bought a generic brand and it also has a very short cord. Hopefully it will last at least 6 months."
2,Toshiba PA3468U-1ACA 75-Watt Global AC Adapter for Toshiba Laptops,I bought this Toshiba power supply item in Jan 2012. In June 2012 it failed after 6 months of normal use with the compatible Toshiba PC. Seems like it should work for several years at least.
2,Worked for two months then broke,"I decided to give this charger two stars and not one star because it worked well for two months.After two months, however, the top of the charger would not stay in the laptop. As I type this now, I am only typing with my left hand...I'm using my right hand to hold the charger into the computer. I always keep my charger in the computer...I never travel with my laptop...so I'm so frustrated by how fast this charger broke.Overall, I would not suggest buying this charger as it broke only after two months. I take really good care of everything I own so this should not have happened.But, on a positive, only being able to use one-hand on the computer at a time is really getting me off the computer...."
1,A waste of good money,"This power cord was shipped on May 4, 2012 and died on July 14, 2012. That is a short life for the price they charged. This is the 3rd power cord purchased for my Toshiba Satellite laptop. May change brands when I shop for a new laptop."
1,Likely to become defective in a few weeks,"Out of the box, this product appears to be a genuine Toshiba part. It has Toshiba labeling, it feels solid and looks like it is good quality. Initially, it worked as it was expected to. After about 6 weeks, it stopped working. There was no visible damage, no overheating or any indication that it had become defective other than it simply would not output power to the laptop.I cannot help but conclude that it is not good quality. I think that it may be counterfeit. Whether it is genuine or a fake, there is no question in my mind that it is poor quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Great Customer Service,I bought this product in April and it is the end of August and it broke. I emailed the company and they emailed me back promptly explaining that the product has a one year warranty and they are replacing my charger. They are very courteous and are willing to work with you if you contact them. If I had more than one laptop I would definitely buy more computer stuff from them. I would recommend this company to anyone who needs a computer charger.
1,Don't bother,"This charger worked fine...for the first couple of months. One day, it just stopped working entirely. There is nothing visibly wrong--it just won't charge my laptop. Frustrating!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,Ordered this item for my lap top a few weeks ago due to my original one going out. Now this new replacement is starting to act as if it has a shortage in it! =( I'm having to wiggle the cord after plugging it in or tapping on it just to get it to charge. This is the 3rd item I've received that was either damaged or non operative....I don't think I'll be ordering anything else from Amazon & that sucks because they have some great deals.
1,Crashed my computer,"I bought a genuine Toshiba power supply because I thought it would be reliable. Unfortunately, my PC crashed repeatedly when I used it with this power supply. I replaced it with an unbranded unit at half the price and have not had any problems."
1,Had to repair it within a week,The item was delivered as promised - broke within a week. Repaired it myself. The problem was a cold solder joint in the jack. Was not well made.
2,Cheap but brittle,"The price was ok, but the cable sheath is brittle and cracks where it joins with the power connectors. SO its great for home use, but perhaps not for travellers"
2,Replacement AC Adapter for Toshiba Laptops,"This adapter is a disappointment. Compared to the original adapter, the cord is shorter and the transformer is also smaller. Next time I will buy a multitasking adapter from Targus or iGo (from RadioShack). Unfortunately there was no way of knowing this adapter was not exactly the same as the original...it was sold under the same Part Number."
4,Replacement,"After reading the reviews, I was a little worried. That being said, the adapter arrived timely and so far, everything is working well. It has been almost two months with no issues. Excellent replacement."
4,Good for the price,"It works fine with the laptop and it's a cheap alternative to the one by toshiba, the only problem is the cord deataches easily from the regulator, but it doesn't matter if you don't move it plus a piece of tape or glue will fix it. But it works great."
4,Charger replacement,The only negative to this product is that the cord is shorter than the original.
2,Short Corded,There is nothing in the discription about it has a super short power cord; be prepared to go to the hardware store to buy an extension cord!
2,Not a good purchase!,"I purchased this item last month. After two days of receiving the charger, it was sensitive, meaning I would need to wiggle before the connection would charge. A customer service representative contacted me in attempt to remove or alter my last review. They offered to refund or exchange the charger for removal of my review. After accepting the proposal, I removed my review. Since then, it has been three weeks and I have not received a refund or exchange. Now, the charger does not work at all, regardless of wiggling the insert piece. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
1,It's only been two months and it's dead!,"So, I did not write a review for this item before and I am glad because it's only been two months and it's dead already!We have to tap it in order to get it to power our laptop and it's always going on and off."
2,"Hardly ""Global""","This supposedly ""global"" adapter did not fit my Satellite U205 laptop. The plug was too big to fit in the port."
2,Toshiba Charger,"It worked for a couple months, it broke off in my laptop.. The charger would get extremely hot to the point where I thought It would start a fire. Im unhappy and now i need another one. smh"
1,Dont buy it,This was the worst device that I have ever purchased.Does not work !!!!!!Can not return an open product.
1,False advertising.,Toshiba part number PA3468U-1ACA is not a 75 watt charger as stated in the ad on Amazon that I ordered from. That part number is to be a 120 watt charger. False advertising!!!!
3,Needed a replacement,"Our power cord for our Toshiba laptop went bad and I ended up ordering this one. If works fine, but is a few feet shorter than the original one. Also, it makes my tv fuzzy when it is plugged in. I don't know if that is the cord or something else. Overall, it gets the job done but I liked the original one better."
1,Stopped working after 3 weeks,"I bought the charger and it worked perfectly for three weeks. Then it stopped working. I returned the item hassle free, postage paid, full refund because I had it less than 30 days. Maybe I just got a bad charger. I will order another one from amazon and hopefully it will last longer."
3,Sparks when you plug the adapter in the wall outlet,"I've had it for about 2 weeks and noticed almost immediately (I usually don't take my adapter out of the wall outlet since I rarely move the lap top). I was about to return it, but a guest of mine said that the adapter won't harm my laptop; something about the power revving up is greater than the.....oh I don't know. It's more of a hassle to return it and now that I think about it, I'll just keep the adapter plugged into a power surge protector and that should suffice. Still, my original adapter never had this problem and it is also a Toshiba product, hence the 3 stars."
5,Works Fine,"The Toshiba AC adapter did not look exactly like the original that it replaced but it works fine. We received it in one week. The original would not stay locked in place, this one does. We haven't had it long enough to say how it will hold up over the long haul. We would purchase it again."
5,Love this item.,I needed an adapter for my laptop that was convenient for me to use when away from my desk. It saves me from plugging and unplugging that one. The price was very affordable and it worked great.
1,waste of money and time,i bought this product three weeks ago. it didnt even last for one month. just waste of money and time.
4,Good Service,"I was not sure which power cord I needed, so I emailed the store, and they promptly answered my question and talked to their tech person to make sure I got the right one for my model. The cord was a little short, I am sure this may be typical on replacement cords, so I just used a longer one from the old power cord. Overall good deal and good service."
1,very mad :(,I was very dissatisfied. I got this as a backup since my charger died. Didn't even have it 2weeks and the damn thing stopped working completely. What a waste of money. So not happy.
1,NEVER AGAIN!,"Let me say this, if my house catches on fire, there is going to be a lawsuit. How on earth on you going to ship me a charger that does not even fit the adapter whole. I had to force it together. Now I can not pull it apart.I have some doubt. ""WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT!"" Smh NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM YOU! I REFUSE TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON SHIPPING AND/OR GAS TO GO SEND IT BACK!"
4,Worked to fix problem,My computer was shutting off as the factory cord last one and half years before causing problems. This replacement has not had a problem since installation.
4,Stellar AC Power Adapter,"The dog chewed on the original cable, so I had to get a new cable. The price was right too. Overall I've been happy with AC Power Adapter and will use it for many more years to come."
1,Don't Buy this (Doesn't fit),This is a great buy unfortunately the plug doesn't fit correctly into my Toshiba laptop contrary to what they said. I have to constantly keep fiddling with it to get a proper connection.
2,Its okay,This was suppose to be the standard replacement of what I had before for my laptop. It works however it seems to be very touchy when plugged in if it charges or not.
4,It works,So far its working for me. There hasn't been any problems. It charges my computer. I have a Satellite L305-S5919. My other charger broke for some reason and I needed a new one so I tried this one and it worked. I have had it for about 10 days. So it works for now and I will post back if anything goes wrong. But for right now I am happy.update: It's been a month and still works great. Yay!
4,pretty good,The only real problem is the cord is on the short side compared to the one that my toshiba came with
3,"Charges, but sparks","I purchased this charger because my original charger started falling apart and the wires were exposed. This charges my laptop, but whenever I go to plug it in, it sparks. Sometimes the other end is already in my laptop, and sometimes it's not, either way it still sparks. It gets the job done, but definitely be careful. It doesn't spark while it's charging, but just the initial spark when you're plugging it in is a bit startling."
4,"Works well, so far","I've been using this item since late July 2010, and so far have had no problems with it. (The original cord that came with my laptop died in less than two years, so I'm not too happy with Toshiba.) The main drawback with this replacement is the very short cord. I will update this review if this item dies on me prematurely."
1,Never buy this product,Purchase this product and it only worked for 2 months. Called about a warranty replacement and they said NO replacement... It have to be within 30 days. Going somewhere else to get a new adapter that will be worth the money. I would rather pay 60 to 100 bucks than be without a charger in several weeks.
1,Fried after four months,"Like many of the reviews on here, it worked fine for a while, then you had to jiggle the cord for it to stay connected. Then it started sizzling and making a hot electrical smell. Pretty much effed up a trip because the charger died."
1,Stopped working after 3 weeks,The charger worked for about 3 weeks before it stopped keeping my computer charged. I know the problem isn't my computer because my computer is able to charge with a different Toshiba computer charger. I don't recommend this product.
3,Meh,"Had my charger for about 2 months. After about a month or so of use, the plug became loose. You have to have it at the exact right angle in the computer in order for it to charge. The slightest movement puts you back on battery power."
1,Good while it lasted....,I needed a replacement power adapter for my laptop so I tried this one. It worked for a while but soon the charging stopped until you move the adapter into a certain position. I don't know if it's cheaply made or what... i would like a refund buy know i can't get one..so i just ordered another one
1,It doesnt even work,I got it faster then I expected. I go and plug it in and it doesn't even work. Dont buy this unless you want to waste money
2,Didn't work out of the box,"I thought I would have good quality with a Toshiba OEM charger. Unfortunately, that was not the case with this unit. The unit was delivered on time and was in good physical shape. However, I plugged the unit into my computer and it worked fine, but after a couple of minutes it was no longer charging. I unplugged it for a minute, plugged it back in and connected it to the computer. Same result: the unit failed to charge after a couple of minutes. I hooked it up to my multitester and show 20V DC at the beginning. After it failed, I put it on the multitester and found that the output was only 2V. I ran the test a couple more times to ensure that the problem was in the unit and got the same results. I sent it back on the same day that I received it. I give it two stars just because the unit arrived on time and in good physical condition."
2,good enough... for 6 months,"I received a compatible product but the cord is shorter. Works just as well as the original... I think. It's hard to tell if it is the reason my 3 year old battery won't charge or if it's just too old.:::::UPDATE:::::Worked for about 6 months then just stopped working. Since my laptop battery won't charge I spliced my old cord and am using that. Save yourself the trouble, buy the manufacturer's cord and don't mess with the knockoffs."
3,Lasted only 11 months,"Bought this last July 2010 - it lasted only 11 months. The contact between the adapter and power cord has become bad. If I keep pressing on power cord plug, it stays on for a while. Then it becomes disconnected. I just bought the generic one for about $8, let's see how it performs."
1,worked for a bit,"i purchased this after my factory charger broke. When i received it, the model number on the charger didnt match the number advertised but it did work. However, after about 4 days it quit working without me having to wiggle it and taking to the local computer shop they said a wire was broken in the plug and it wouldnt be financially feasible to fix it. but considering a new one from the manufacturer is 70 bucks, i guess you get what you pay for."
2,Worked Great.......,"Ordered in late November 2010, as a replacement for the original charger. Was surprised to see that it was an actual ""Toshiba"" branded product....Worked great until early June 2011, when it just stopped working.Dead."
1,Died after 2 weeks.,I bought two and I thought its like the original one. when the first one died i thought my sons did something bad to it. but second one dies suddenly and made me believe that it is the charger problem.
2,weak cable. broke within 3 weeks,"I got this one, thinking it will be good for atleast 8-10 months.But the cable is not strong enough and the outer black covering/insulationstarted breaking, revealing the inner wires.Also the connection between the two parts, is not not tight enoughand hence, there is loose connection which needs constant monitoringto ensure that my laptop is getting charged.Overall, I am not satisfied.But I wonder, give the low price(i got it for 13$), this is the bestI can get out of it."
1,Wires exposed and blew!,"I purchased this replacement cord at the end of September, and by mid December, the wires at the base of the adapter were completely exposed and blew! It popped and smoked!The cord never even left my house and was on a table while plugged in, so no tugging or messing with it.This product is crap. Do not waste your money!"
1,Flat out dangerous,"I never review on Amazon, but this time I had to. I bought this to replace my original ac adapter that I lost in a flood. It sparks a tad every time you plug it in, and less than two months after having it the cord covering broke away and exposed wires. Unbeknownst to me the wires got crossed. I just plugged it in and Poof! A spark, some smoke and the wire was disconnected. The wires had crossed and the electricity severed them. I can only imagine what would have happened if I had left it unattended.Don't buy this, find something else."
1,Unsatisfied,"I bought this adapter 2 months ago, at first it worked just like the original, but now I have to push it very hard or move it in order to charge my computer. I have taken care of the cord but it does not work.TOTALLY DISSAPOINTED!!!!"
5,super happy,I initially purchased this replacement power supply after my original one came apart. So far no problems with the new one and it works great.
1,Bad power cord,I bought this cord about two months ago and it is already acting up. I have not traveled with my laptop and only used it at home. Do not buy this cord from this company.
1,Piece of Crap,Purchased this item as a replacement for my laptop. Item overheated with every use and now (after four uses) the cord separated at the power supply and the wires are now exposed. Do not recommend this item to anyone.
2,Plug creates spark everytime,"Although this charger seems to do its job, I am concerned that it could be damaging my laptop because it creates a spark every time that I plug it into a socket. If the spark creates some sort of surge, my laptop will be toast. The description says genuine Tosiba parts but it is hard to believe that it is true."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was excited to buy it, when it came in it fit my toshiba BUT THE CHARGER DID NOT WORK!!! DONT BUY IT!!!!"
1,Worked for 8 months,I got this adapter on September 9th 2011. It worked fine for 8 months but unexpectedly broke. I didn't have any problems for those 8 months but I started hearing clicking noises on the power brick and it wouldn't charge anymore.
1,"cheap, fake???","I received the item and it worked perfectly fine for a month, then it suddenly stopped working...It overheated by itself and won't charge my computer. The cord is perfectly fine too. Feels cheap and I don't think it's the official toshiba charger. It has three prongs and requires a surge protector. I would not recommend this charger"
2,Lasted 9months if even that,This adapter was great for the first few months but about 2months ago I had to begin adjusting it's orientation for the computer to register the charge. Now it doesn't work at all (lasted from July through March). It also has a tendency to get very hot. I will not be buying this one again.
1,Bad Cord,"I purchased this in October and as of today it no longer works. The AC cord cover began separating with in a couple of months. I had to secure the exposed wires with electrical tape. I would not recommend this product, it is cheaply made.Update: I just purchased a new power cord ($10) to plug into the adapter and it is working again."
2,"Shipped on February 19, 2010 RIP June 2010","only lasted passed the return window. My original cord last for 3.5 years. This replacement lasted only 4 months. Not happy, hope others had better luck!"
4,Fills the need,Works fine. Took a long time to ship but the product was what I had needed. And works fine for the laptop.
5,Emergency Adapter,"My laptop's adapter had a major short and I needed a new one...QUICK! Amazon.com came through for me once again. Very reasonable priced and the delivery wasn't that long, especially during the Christmas season. Thank you Amazon.com."
2,Ok replacement,"A little skeptical so far, so good for the price. Hope it stands up to the ongoing required. Okay we'll see."
2,Not the greatest,"I should have read the description more carefully. Really thought that Iwas buying a Ray Charles CD. Instead there was a minimum ofmusic performed by Ray, and a lot of less than great performances by others. Disappointing!"
3,Uncle Ray in concert,Ray's performance is excellent but the quality of the film is not. I never had the opportunity to see him perform in person so this is the closest I'll ever get. I only regret the quality wasn't better.
5,Where the Soul never gets old!,"What a great tribute to a man celebrating 50 years in music and his 61st birthday. The live concert from 1990 or 1991, sounds excellent, lighting good and the mood is fun with a jazzy, soul, pop, country sound. Many have come to celebrate and honor Ray Charles. The concert shows backstage rehearsals, interviews and comedy, one being George Lopez. There is something for the younger set, but the best comes from some of the best in solos and duets with Ray Charles.Some memorable songs; Ray Charles (What'd I Say); (Livin' for the City) ; (Just for a Thrill); Stevie Wonder(Hallelujah); Willie Nelson (Busted); Michael Bolton (Georgia); Willie Nelson (Busted); Randy Travis (You're Cheatin' Heart); Gladys Knight (I Wish I'd Never Love You At All); Michael McDonald (I Got a Woman); Tevin Campbell (Just Ask Me To). The finale is Ray leading with America The Beautiful. Ray Charles shares his gratitude to his guests for making time for his celebration. Great Music! .....Rizzo"
4,Still in great condition.,I wanted this so I could keep a comparison to the newest one that came out this year. The pages are a little yellow but that is expected on a book this old. I'm keeping it in a safe place and hope to share it with my kids one day.It came in a protective sleeve and amazing to see the old ads in here and how cheap stuff was at this time.
3,ok,Tropimix is not quite what I had hoped. My parrot would rather eat Roudybush. there is a good mix of dried fruit and pellets. for some reason I had expected more veggies.
4,Superb exercise in logic.,"Talbott is devoted to logical reasoning. I almost want to say he is besotted with it.For me, the book's most masterful feature is its treatment of Saint Paul's expectation of ultimate universal reconciliation. While the book establishes persuasively that this was the view held by Paul, it goes on to document other evidence from early Christian sources to show this view continued for centuries among Christian thinkers.Would you be disappointed if God's creative activity were not brought to best outcome? Aren't the intelligence and goodness of God such that he will find a way to avoid disappointing us who hope for this best outcome, including the ultimate reconciliation we yearn for in the Lord's prayer? Forgive us as (when/while) we forgive others."
5,Talbott does an excellent job in building his case,"A previous review that said they ""studied"" this book is completely accurate. You just can't read it as you would a common novel. I know I'll have to read it again to fully comprehend. I'm looking forward to Universal Salvation: The Current Debate which is due out this Spring. In this new book, seven (I believe) religious scholars debate Talbott's views. Also, Talbott is given an opportunity for rebuttal."
1,UNCONVINCING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The problem with this book(and all modern evangelical feel good pseudo-psychologies, protestANTism) is that it denies and rejects Is. 66:24, Mark 9:44 and it goes against the Bible(which is the rule of measure)at Ephesians 4:4-6 & Matthew 16:18-19."
5,Cool water for a blistered soul,"God, thank you for Dr. Talbott. I struggled and still am struggling with so much fear of hell and eternal torment. Fear and despair have been seared deeply into my soul and though I know the truth, it will take time for it to settle in my heart.This book is great for those whose ears and minds have been trained to read eternal torment into the Bible. It will build a logical framework for re-interpretting those ""hard saying"" passages and escaping the Calvinist or Arminian mindset.I recommend you pick it up today!"
1,I shoulda' listened...,"My brother advised me not to get these... did I listen...NOOOOO. I just got them this afternoon and checked the fit. They do not fit. All the way around 1/8"" to 1/4"" of the handle is exposed. They are not uniform either. I just completed the process for returning this product and I do not recommend them... the one star rating is only because that is the minimum, no stars would be appropriate!"
1,crappy,"I do not like these, I did not get instructions in putting these on, so I took it upon myself to clean all areas with alcohol and then put on the door handle covers and the mirror covers (making sure they were on appropriate LH RH let sit awhile and then drove the truck and guess what what a piece of junk!!!! the door handle covers fell off going down the highway and just for a precaution I took off the mirror covers when i got home and used my own double sided tape and heated the tape to make them stick better. I would not recommend this product to anyone.... I would really like my money back this is junk....as I have only purchased these less than a week ago."
2,Buying brand name Putco doesn't help,"I purchased this item, along with chrome mirror covers, tailgate chrome etc. one year ago. It is now discolored, pitted and the Putco mirror covers are bubbled as well.Don't spend the extra money on Putco accessories, its not worth it."
1,worst nightmare,"I ordered this product through Real Truck and they do not fit a 2007 Kia Sorrent as advertised not only do they not fit, they took the paint off when I removed them after attemping installation. Still trying to get a solution."
3,A cut above the usual,"After an unforgettable introduction with light instrumentation and choir, it is disheartening to suddenly hear the predictable strains of typically Mozartesque string writing. The fast-paced cues contain many notable simple pleasures; the problem is in more musically intimate moments, which are generic orchestrations and ditties, interchangeable from one Doyle film score to another. The assertiveness of the music and the spellbinding opening push it a step above average."
4,A Fresh Perspective,"Although Anna Quindlen's views rarely veer off standard liberal-feminist territory, her reasons behind her opinions are refreshing. She deftly weaves her own personal experiences as well as the experiences of others into her commentaries. She does not rely on statistics or historical data, but on real life. It's an unusual approach that allows her words to stick with the reader longer than that of typical opinion writers."
5,Svankmajer's content and style educates while entertains,"Scenes from the Surreal is composed of three seperate sections. The first dealing with creation of man making comic use of claymation, modernism, and Svanmajer's own imagination. The second section creates a morbid interpretation about the competitivness of athletics, displayed in a soccer game to the death. The third section deals with the views of the communism take-over and the patriotism of the nations. Very passionate and imaginative. Awakens the viewers to the social aspects of history and social view, while being entertained by claymation characters. To end, Svankmajer has an informative interview. I enjoyed this production thouroughly"
2,Not useful for grout cleaning,This brush may be great for polishing but it is not useful for cleaning grout. I searched a lot of products and there were not many options for cleaning without stripping completely. In case someone else is looking for the same thing this brush is not the answer.
4,Good,"Very good gadget. The only thing missing is the Backspace key. But the two extra USB are good, although they are not USB 2.0."
3,"Nice Design, Flawed Implementation","I picked one of these up for use with a 3D Design package, which makes use of the numeric keypad for special functions. Unfortunately, while the Pocket Keypad does work well for typing in numbers or cursor keys, it doesn't actually simulate the numeric keypad correctly. For applications that need to be able to distinguish between the numbers on the top row of the keyboard versus the numbers on the keypad, this device did not work. I wasted a couple hours trying to debug the setup before giving up and buying a different USB keypad (the Targus AKP01US) and finding it was the Kensington that was the problem.Too bad, because otherwise it's a nice-looking, compact, and good-feeling unit. It just doesn't work right for my specialized application (a 3D package called Blender)"
2,Good design but doesn't work with my laptop,"I purchased this numeric keypad because it had a standard layout like conventional desktop numeric keypads. To be specific, it has a single, large 0/Insert key where others add the ""000"" key between the Enter and 0/Insert key. However, the moment that I plug it into my HP/Compaq laptop (running Windows XP Pro), it triggers an overload alert and the USB port is immediately disabled. No workaround."
3,Chino XL and Coolio Deliver!,"I recently purchased this DVD at Wal*Mart of all places. I saw the cover and read the back description of the movie and decided I must get this movie. There are two great performances in the movie. One by rapper Coolio, who plays his role well. The other great performance is by another rapper, Chino XL who is absolutely beautiful. I can't even mention what I was thinking every time he was onscreen. Chino played his role with sarcastic humor and seriousness. Much of the acting, sad to say is wooden and quite lousy."
2,"NOT REALLY MUCH OF A GANGSTA MOVIE, MORE OF A COP MOVIE","A RUTHLESS GANGSTA WHO'S TAKEN OFF DEATH ROW AND RELEASED BACK INTO SOCIETY VOWS TO KILL THE PRIEST AND THE COP [CHINO XL] WHO'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING HIM LOCKED UP. SLOW MOVING, TO SAY THE LEAST. THE FEW ACTION SCENES THAT'RE IN THIS MOVIE ARE DECENT, BUT IT'S TOO FULL OF POINTLESS DIALOGUE AND THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT REALLY GOOD ACTORS. ANYWAY, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE CHINO XL AND/OR COOLIO. IT AIN'T WORTH THE MONEY JUST TO SEE THESE 2 RAPPERS IN THIS STANDARD COP MOVIE."
4,s**t on you nay-sayers/disagreers!,"f**k whatcha think. I don't care. I think it's 1 of my favorite songs alongside ""Slow Jams"" with Ye and J. Foxx, this is off da chain you see what I mean. This is truly outstanding. My boy, my favorite rapper Twista deserves credit in this. He's very enormous, more relaxed, versatile, creative, good rapper tho. May I add on to that. As for Mistermaxxx, try again next time aight. It's good whatcha say but u're missing the point.This song features a sample of Lenny Williams timeless R&B; classic, ""You Know I Love You"", gave the song a shot but it's still not that bad, don't wanna say too generic, too corny or too overrated, this what caught me since after ""Overnight"" came out."
2,"Bad sampling, with a twist!","Twista's 2nd single off ""Kamikaze"", ""Overnight Celebrity"", to put it bluntly, contains some of the most irritating sampling in the world. The sampling of someone screaming in the chorus is NOT a work of art, it's just plain annoying. If that wasn't there, this would be a pretty good song, and would merit about 4 stars.As Twista's name suggests, he twists his words and his raps flow at breakneck speed, and if I'm correct, he is close to the world record for fastest rapper. He obviously has talent, but bad production from Kanye West kills the song here. Did Kanye use all his GOOD beats and samples on Jay-Z? Who knows..."
1,while slow Jamez works,"this is basically a Poor Man's take of that formula which is a comeback of a song way too soon for it's own Good.Twista is cool&I'm glad to see His comeback,but this Cut ain't working for me.decent video but generic song."
3,Not to Shabby,This album is pretty much a better download than a buy. However in it's defense it has a nice mix of hip-hop and soul. The movie placed the songs very well I should add.
2,Is this Fendi quality?,"All the hardware on this bag fell off within 4 weeks. Like some Fendi bags it cannot close securely, but the quality seemd poor to me anyway. The stitching has started to unravel as well in some areas.I have 3 year olf Loius Vuitton that look better than this bag. Not a good deal."
1,Help finding the original soundtrack,"I have a CD which contains the original recordings for both ""A Man and A Woman"" (Un Homme Et Une Femme) as well as ""Live for Life"" (Vivre Pour Vivre). It was Manufactured and Marketed by DRG Records. Hope this helps all of those who love this soundtrack as much as I!"
1,The right one is available at Amazon,"The real sound track is available at Amazon, but you have to search in French. Un Homme et une Femme. I am looking forward to once again hearing the songs to the magical movie I first saw in my 18th year. Thanks Amazon."
2,For Pure Land practitioners only,"A narrowly focused historical and theological ""defense"" of this Buddhist sect's belief system. This is not a good book for the general reader who wants to learn more about Budhhism. However, if one was already a practitioner of Pure Land Buddhism, and one wanted a better understanding of how its theology developed in 13th century Japan, this book would be very helpful."
1,Overated,Did not perform well at all for hooking up to a digital converter box to the TV. The location was about 40 miles from a larger city and received no signals at all. I then took the antenna to a new location about 25 miles from a major metropolitan area (Chicago) and set it up. It still did not bring in any reception. I put it to the side and tried a set of digital rabbit ear antenna. I now receive about 3 dozen channels.
4,Celstron Review,"Nice... wish I lived under a blacker sky. My only complaint is that I wish the controller display was large-format TFT LCD for my tired old eyes. Otherwise, love it."
5,Crisp image,"Now I know what they meant by ""crisp image"". Just with the 25mm ocular is awesome. Can't wait to get more eye-pieces."
1,JUNK,"This saw is junk I cannot get it to cut square, I called the manufacture and tried what they said still cuts off.I am stuck with it"
2,Assumes you already know quark terminology,This isn't an introductory book on quarks. It assumes you already know the terminology. What is spin? What is isospin? The glossary at the back isn't helpful. I read 20 or so pages and then realized it wasn't an oversight... He really has no plans to introduce these and other basic terms and explain them. Very disappointing.
4,My favorite Zappa line-up doing great material,"I only wish there was a video of this terrific cd. I saw them perfrom this and if you think Magdelena is, uh shall we say probelmatic as an audio, you should have seen Mr. Kaylan act out the part. Anyway, the vocals are incredible and don't believe what anyone else has to say - the music is top notch, including Zappa's phenomenal guitar work on both Call Any Vegetable and Dog Breath. In fact I defy anybody to find a more perfect live guitar solo with the possible exception of Crossroads. Get it, play it, and don't worry about the women in your life who will be appalled. That's the point!"
5,frank zappa at his best,"from start to finish this cd is amazing. i love the short lived Flo and Eddie period. to me, thats some of his best music. great vocals, great music. worth it for the version of Call any Vegtable alone."
3,"Billy, Eddie, several vegetables, bad breath and child molestation?","Frank Zappa / Los Mothers / Just another band from L.A.:Five Live songs...-------Billy The Mountain - This is the reason to buy the album. funny, silly, enjoyableCall Any Vegetable - ok version of a Mothers chestnutEddie, Are you Kidding? - You probably have to be from Los Angeles (during the sixties) to get the references here. If you are, this one is very funny. If not, it's a head scratcher.Magdalena - An uncomfortable song to listen to at best. Sexually immature stupidity.Dog Breath - a good song, not great-------This album is NOT for the kiddies.Three Stars but still worth getting for ""Billie"" and ""Eddie"""
4,Call any Vegetable!,"I can't believe that nobody has written a review of this album! This little performance gem features the comedy / vocal stylings of Flo and Eddie (a.k.a. the Turtles). The music is funny and the lyrics are tasteless. Billy The Mountain is a rolicking opus about (you guessed it)....a mountain that decides to go on vacation with his wife Ethel (a tree). The story evolves into an anti-war protest. Bizarre? Yes. Funny? Definitely. Call any Vegetable, Eddie are you Kidding and Magdalena round out the evening. The comedy is dated now, but still funny as hell."
3,Hasn't worn well through the years,"I loved this album in high school when hearing the f word on vinyl was a kick. Now I find most of Billy the Mountain to be dated and juvenile, though the ending is still pretty neat. That leaves the 'other' side of the lp, which had a great version of Call Any Vegetable, the inane Eddie Are You Kidding, and a phenomenal rendition of Dog Breath (one of my favorite Zappa guitar solos). Magdalena is wonderfully crude and anti-PC, but my wife won't let me play it in the house."
3,An O.K. Album,"Actually ""Billy The Mountain"" is awesome! A 24 mins tale of the adventures of a mountain and his stunning wife (a tree). Very funny and varied musically. The track contains a lot of improvisation by Flo & Eddie. But due to it's length and weirdness it's not a track I often play.(It's GREAT when I'm in the mood for it though)As for ""Call Any Vegetable"" well that is the best version I have heard so far due to the keyboard, the small variation in the lyrics and the affirmation that IT IS GREAT TO BE ALIVE! But I Miss the instrumental that followed it on Absolutely Free (Ritual & Dance Of The Young Pumpkin)The next two tracks are under the usual Zappa standard. Not very good musically or lirically.As for ""Dog Breath"" it has a very cool rythm, conceptual continuity and one of the best Zappa solos (even though we know that they're all great)I would not reccommend this for the Zappa neophyte but to ""true"" fans who wish to share the insanity of the grandiose ""Billy The Mountain"""
1,Be Warned,"This has got to be my least favourite Zappa album, Not that it doesn't hav a few good moments, I just find it impossible to listen all the way through. unless your a big fan of Flo and Eddie (sorry i just don't understand) or a zappa completist be very cautious with this one. zappa has many great albums but this isn't one of them."
5,Is that a Sears poncho?,"Dated? No way. The issues are timeless, as Frank's music can attest. Polyester double knits always have been and always will be cheesy and therefore subject to ridicule, however there will never be anyone as talented and as funny as Frank to mock them.American white trash will continue to pervade society and it's really a shame that there is no one else around who can come close to disparaging them as well as Frank did.The essential message here is one that all can relate to-""And I wanna tell ya, if there is anybody here who doesn't believe that it is F*CKING GREAT to be alive, I wish they would go now, because this show will bring them down so much . . ."""
2,Don't you hate it when somethin' is almost good?,"There's a three guitar attack, the opening track is called ""puller"" and there's a track called ""fountains of pain""! So why two stars? Because Jai Diablo can't sing! This band could be on to something different and could actually create a nice little niche' for themself if they could find a new singer. It's almost painful to listen to. jai is so tone deaf that it takes away from 3 guitars blaring crunchy nu-metal riffs you could crack your teeth to. Unfortunatly this album is dissapointing, I would only reccomend this album on two conditions, First you don't care about vocals you just want something to turn up real loud, or second, you are in a band and want to hear the potential that a three guitar band has."
5,"Heavy, grinding, rock and roll heaven","...that's about it, this cd doesn't leave my player. great band, i wish they had more albums."
4,"Tell it, girlfriend!","Despite the title, Joanne Kimes' book is not negative, nor does it ""dis"" the precious gift of childbearing. Instead, it provides comfort and a few good laughs for the woman struggling through her pregnancy.When I found this book, I was about eleven weeks pregnant with my first baby and had more than had it with the all-day sickness, burping, fatigue, etc. I'd never complained so much in my life, nor felt so miserable for such an extended period of time. On top of that, I felt guilty for not being more grateful for the beautiful gift God had given my husband and me, guilty for not having a better attitude.Reading Ms. Kimes' personal testimony and practical tips made me realize that I was not alone in my suffering, and that it wouldn't last forever. If your pregnancy is not measuring up to the blissful time you've been led to believe it must be, and you need some solace and cheering up, I believe reading this book will help."
2,Normal pregnancy? Then spend your money on other books,"I purchased this book based on the witty title and other reviews. I have been disappointed with the content, but that's probably because I have experienced an uneventful pregnancy. I found that I could not relate to the seemingly unending trials the author endured throughout her pregnancy. I do give the author credit for her funny moments and frank manner in her story telling. They gave me a chuckle every now and then. Overall, I found that the What to Expect series and The Modern Girl's Guide to Motherhood were much more informative and helpful."
1,Bitter and disillusioned,"I can understand that pregnancy can suck! As a mother of three, two of my pregnancies consisted of hyperemesis until 17 weeks. Throwing up three times a day sucks! But as a woman who also trusts in pregnancy and birth, I find SO MANY things in this book upsetting. Giving away your body, birth and baby to an OB's whims is never okay. No-where is there any talk about midwives, birth centers or other options. Episiotomys are outdated and are preformed so that they can stich a woman easier. It is almost always better to tear and OF COURSE have perineal counterpressure. Breastfeeding is an amazing experience (and can be difficult), but one to treasure. There are so many things that are bitter and just plain wrong about this book. Pregnancy can suck yes...but not that bad!"
1,This BOOK Sucks....,"I thought this book would be amusing and at least somewhat informative. It is neither. The author just thinks she has a sense of humor. Not really a helpful and informative tidbit of info in the entire book. What a waste of reading time. Also, not that important, but I just can't pass on commenting....Whats with the pre-Cindi Lauper acid washed jeans on the pregers lady on the cover?"
5,Must Have !!!,"I've been reading every pregnancy book I can get me hands on. This one is by far the best. It's truthful, funny and the most helpful book out there. Pregnancy is a wonderful experience but it's taboo to discuss the reality of it. This book is real! Don't worry about the title, pregnancy is still a wonderful miracle. I look forward to going through it again, but I wouldn't do it without this book!"
5,Funny Read,I've really enjoyed this book. It tells you what you need to know without being the normal blah blah blah books.
3,Its okay,Will make you laugh at some points. I guess that counts for something when you are struggling through a pregnancy.
3,"Fun read, but not very informative","This was a fun read to see how another woman experienced her pregnancy. But hers seems to be quite different from mine, and so I don't see the humor (if the author's trying to be funny) in her grudge towards her husband. If you have questions about your pregnancy this is not the book to go to, but it will certainly allow you to compare notes and share the ups and downs of your pregnancy."
3,not what I expected but still good,"This title is a little misleading in my mind because there aren't any episodes on here at all, just clips from episodes that I hadn't seen before. There are no actual full episodes of the show on this tape. However, the clips are hilarious and I would still recommend getting this if you are a Hooneymooner's fan or for the Hooneymooner's fan in your life!"
5,A must read for any woman,"Great book. Very useful for any woman, regardless of social or economic status; whether in corporate, retail, construction or in high school. This book is cleverly compiled by viewpoints of 25 different professional women each covering a chapter, (which I found made for a more interesting read). The topics range from etiquette, to assertiveness skills, managing finances, marketing yourself (by dressing professionally etc.,)When you read this book, it will not only give you the tools to BECOMING a professional, but if you already are a professional, you may find that the tools will serve as useful reminders for us to ACT more professionally. Unfortunately, during the hustle and bustle of surviving as women in a competitive environment, we forget to act professionally. For example, we often confuse being assertive with being aggressive. A great holiday gift. It will definitely propel the reader to make a new year's resolution to become a professional woman in 2006."
5,For my rofessional women,"I have three professional women in my life - my wife and two daughters - who will find the ideas so eloquently captured on the pages of this book to be a valuable tool to enahnce their professional carreers. The contents are of particular relevance and importance to my two daughters, both young professionals trying to find their way in a male dominated business world. The ideas in this book could revolutionize the thinking of many young professional women, providing them with the edge they need to become dominant in their professions."
3,So far I like this coffeemaker.,"I just bought the Melita coffeemaker this A.M.. I liked the style and features of this brand. I brought it home, cleaned and used it immediately. I'm impressed w/it. But now after reading a few of the reviews, I'm somewhat concerned. Although one reviewer wrote that Melita customer service was good, I hope I won't be needing them.I just want a coffeemaker that works and makes good coffee."
2,Good coffee......but that's all.,"Bought this coffee maker because of Melita's reputation for making good coffee and the fast brew feature....we weren't disappointed. Actually you don't even need the timer feature because of the speed it brewed. Unfortunately, aside from that, the coffee maker itself has been a disappointment. First of all, after a month it stopped working...so we sent it back and received a replacement. The top on both models warped and has never closed correctly. When pouring, you need to remove the lid (not a flip top) otherwise you end up pouring half a cup on the counter. Now after about another year, the pump has stopped !!! Do yourself a favor, go buy a cheap Mr. Coffee or Black and Decker. They all make coffee just as good."
2,What a mess,"I have also had the previously mentioned problem of coffee grounds spewing all over the counter from the filter basket. This was solved by prying out the ""pause and serve"" mechanism at the bottom of the basket. Now it seems I have the problem with the on/off switch cutting out. One coffee maker/two serious problems that reviewers consistently mention. Be glad you (unlike me)decided to check reviews before getting a coffee maker, and get a good one."
2,Not for the absent-minded,"This came as a gift, to replace a 10-year-old Black & Decker, which worked until movers dropped it last week. I am 66 and, what is significant for this review, I have vision no better than is common for that age. I have made only one pot of coffee with the Melitta so far. Coffee was excellent, but (1) the black-on-black identification on the buttons is impossible to read, (2) the clock is not lighted, and (3), unless one uses the delay timer (which, since I am retired, I do not), there is no timed automatic shutoff. The first two attributes are annoyances, but the third is a safety concern."
2,Controls very hard to read,"Got this to replace an old Krups that wasn't programmable. Likes: fast brew, coffee very hot (almost too hot!). Dislikes: controls are black-on-black buttons, can't see clock without bending down to view head on, can't program ""on"" time to hold after brewing for more than 2 hours. I ended up returning this one and spending a little more to get a Braun KF580."
2,Fried after 2 years,"It's too bad we live in such a disposable world these days. I've had this coffeemaker just over 2 years and today it brewed the coffee back into the brewing mechanism and shorted out - not before spewing coffee all over the counter and smoking! Overall the coffeemaker was okay, but I'm disappointed it didn't last longer than 2 years considering that I only used it occasionally. Not worth the money."
2,Disappointed,"I have been very disappointed with this coffeepot. If you don't have the carafe placed just right, you can end up with a big mess. I have cleaned numerous ones. I now have to stay with the pot when it starts to brew to make sure that the water is trickling out of the filter properly."
3,A little fussy,"Overall, its performance is satisfactory, with one substantial negative: It is very sensitive to the presence off fine grounds. These clog the filter and cause an overflow of the coffee slurry into the pot and the internals of the coffee maker, creating a big mess.To prevent this, I have to pre-screen ground coffee using a fine-mesh strainer to remove the very fine grounds.Other coffee makers I have owned used filters with greater area or baskets of greater capacity, so I never saw this before."
2,Buttons and overheating,"I had this machine for about 1 1/2 years. I followed the instructions of cleaning once a month with vinegar. As I was doing this, this past weekend I came back to the display blacked out. I tried to turn off the machine and the buttons weren't working either. I had to unplug the machine to get it to turn off. After a few minutes the display came back on. I set the clock and the timer but could not use the on/off button. I had other machines that lasted years. I will never buy a Melitta coffee pot again."
2,"Awesome, then it DIED!","I thought this coffee maker was the answer when I first bought it. I'd researched it well and it made fast, hot, excellent tasting coffee. Then about 6 months later it died! Started holding water in the filter, spilling grinds all over and generally making a huge mess.I went with the Cuisinart coffee maker and what a difference! It's slower, but the construction of the coffee maker far surpasses the plastic of the Melitta and I know it will last longer. My advice, check out Cuisinart before you spend your money on this one."
3,Didn't last a year,"I loved this coffee maker, but like some of your other reviewers had experienced, it stopped working in less than a year. I wouldn't mind replacing the part that broke (the little pcb inside the switch compartment), but you can't buy one. I've had coffee makers in the past that I had wished would break so I could get a new one and now I have one I love, but would be scared to replace it for fear of it not lasting."
1,broken carafe,"I owned this coffee maker for about a week. One morning, on the way from the sink to the coffee maker with the carafe FULL of water, the glass carafe completely separated from the metal frame and exploded upon impact with my ceramic tile floor.Water and shattered glass all over everything.Imagine if that pot had been filled with 12 cups of hot coffee....."
2,If Only It Wouldn't Self-Destruct,"I love the fact that this machine brews so quickly, and I thought it was the answer to my coffee-fiend prayers, but the first one I bought had to be returned after 2 weeks when smoke began pouring out from under the lid. I thought it had to be a single defective machine, and bought another. This one lasted slightly longer, about 4 months, before it self-destructed. Time to wake up and smell the coffee and get a different brand!"
2,doesn't last long,"My husband and I bought this exact coffeemaker less than 3 months ago and this morning I couldn't wait for a cup of hot coffee and of all mornings the darn thing stopped working. This is not the first coffeemaker of this kind we have bought, we like it so much better that any other ones because the hot plate gets the coffee real hot, but this maker sure doesn't last long!!! Don't you think the maker could make this a little better than having a life spam of 3 months? To bad we haven't found another coffee maker that makes HOT coffee because if we do I'll NEVER buy this one again!"
2,Messy !!!,"While the coffee maker has the feature of automatic brew I originally wanted, I am quite disappointed in the ""pour while brewing"" feature, as it drips when carafe is pulled out.Also, I am disappointed in how messy the top cover gets from the brewing process. I guess because the water flows so fast, it splatters the grounds onto the top and they collect there, then when I lift it up, the collected moisture dribbles down into the water canister (where only water should go). This is the worst part of the design. My Braun worked well for 15 years, I was wanting the auto brew feature, now I wished I had kept my cheap Braun."
1,Short curcuit and smoke,"For two months, we loved this coffee pot thanks to the hot and fast brew. Yesterday, the unit short curcuited when water overflowed into the heating element. Smoke was coming out of the rear of the unit. In a silly attempt to make a second pot of coffee, smoke continued billowing out of the rear of the unit and large sparks flew when I unplugged it from the electrical outlet. We are immensely disappointed as it brewed, for two months,a great cup of coffee."
3,"Not the best, but not bad for the money",The best feature is the brewing speed. The coffee is good and hot enough but not as hot as my old Faberware electric perk. Carafe is very cheap and will crack easily. Unit is tall and thus pouring water into the resovoir without spilling is a bit of a challenge. Overall a decent machine for the money. If quick brew is a priority then this machine is for you.
2,Melitta Fast Brew Coffeemaker,"I have had my Melitta Fast Brew Coffeemaker for just over a year. While it brews coffee fast, it has some features which definitely need improving. (1) Water indicator hard to read unless in bright light. (2) It's easy to pour water into the coffee grounds while trying to pour it into the reservoir. (3) It seems to brew inconsistently, even though we are very careful about putting the same amount of water and coffee in each time. (4) Our unit just went haywire and has to be replaced. I think it should have a much longer life! (and yes, I cleaned it regularly with white vinegar) We're going to replace it with a different brand."
4,melitta coffee maker,Where can i purchase a white carafe for this coffee maker?I need the 12 cup white carafe. Otherwise i love the coffee from this.. excellent
1,Does Not Work Well,This thing had watery coffee compared to my Mr. Coffee unit. I'm going back to Mr. Coffee.The water fill indicator looks like it is from 20 years ago.
4,Best Coffeemaker I Have Owned,"Makes a great cup of coffee. Well constructed. Coffee is best made with 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 oz cup, but this coffeemaker measures each cup at 5 oz, and this is the only reason that I do not rate it a 5 star. Amazon really ships fast and has the best price with the free shipping."
1,Avoid this coffeemaker,"Purchased this unit after having gone through 4 Black & Decker deluxe machines in 18 months. Like the B&D brand, the Melitta didn't live up to daily use of one pot a day, maybe 2 pots if we had company. WE've had this one 3 months now and it's not good. Did all the same things noted above - if coffee grounds are too fine the basket overflows backing up onto the counter, floor and into machine itself. Very difficult to pour water into on the tiny right hand side opening. Makes a good cup of Joe and extra hot. But it's still not good. The clock timer never worked correctly. Target stores near me don't carry any longer so I can't exchange it w/in 90 days. I purchased a cheapo Toastmaster for $7.88 yesterday instead. I'm through w/expensive machines. B4 the Black&Deckers we had a $200 Krups. It died at the 11 month mark, Krups wouldn't fix it. All these coffee makers are junk made in 3rd world countries. Welcome to ""low low prices"" folks!"
3,Melitta MEFB2B doesn't quite cut it,"Just a brief review: A high quality drip coffee maker needs to meet a couple of key requirements in order to brew a proper cup of coffee: brewing temp and speed. A temp too high or too low, or taking too long will either over or under extract the flavors of the coffee.This drip maker has all the advertising/marketing making of a great drip machine, but it falls short on one of the 2 critical performance criteria: temperature. It needs to brew between 195* and 205* F. My unit brewed at ~ 184* in mid cycle measured with a digital thermometer probe calibrated to boiling water @ 212*F.Not recommended for optimal coffee extraction."
1,Worst Coffee Maker I've Ever Used,"This is by far the worst coffee maker I've ever used, and I've had several. Any time you make more than 6-8 cups, you end up with a big mess to clean up b/c the water dispension doesn't keep up with the coffee in the basket, and often times I end up with grounds in the coffee. (Just today I had to sift out 3 tablespoons of coffee grounds after making 12 cups! Unbelievable.) Do yourself a favor and purchase a different type; this one is terrible."
4,I love this machine,"I have had the Fast Brew for almost 2 years and it is still the best coffee maker I have ever had. The part is that it's FAST as the name implies and the coffee tastes great. I have not used the automatic brewing because of the speed which it brews...I just set it up at night and push start in the morning so I have fresh coffee when I know I am ready for it. I would give it 5 stars except that like all coffee makers I have owned, it has a small pour-in space for water. Also the lid to the pot does not always snap on properly after washing. All of this I can live with."
1,Do not recommend,I purchased one of these a few months ago and it worked well for awhile but then it started to overheat and the bottom of the coffeemaker was partially melted. Potential fire hazard
3,DISSAPOINTED COFFEE LOVER,"My husband and I purchased the Melitta Fast Brew 8 months ago after returning a Mr. Coffee maker that made horrible tasting coffee that was never hot. We were thrilled with our purchase - it was fast, the coffee was hot, the drip proof spout was a first and the taste was always delicious! However, two days ago it just died - it made steam and the noises it makes as if it was in the last few seconds of brewing and, alas, no coffee. I rushed out last night to purchase a new one and Target only carries the Melitta style that has an attached grinder (we already own one)and they were presently out of this item. Since my previous coffee maker purchases have been disappointing, I went home empty handed and made coffee manually this morning by pouring hot water over my ground coffee. Hands down, Melitta makes the best tasting coffee maker, unfortunately, it didn't last."
2,DO NOT BUY - Here's why...,"We really liked this coffee maker - it brewed a mess of coffee fast - was attractive in a retro way - and worked fine. But then the electronics (clock & timer) starting getting weird. In about 6 months, every time you made coffee the display would go blank - and you couldn't even turn the coffee maker off! My uneducated guess is that there's a LOT OF HEAT being generated right around the PCB board (clock / timer) and it fries itself each time you make coffee. There's another review here with the same complaint. ALSO - difficult to fill if you are LEFT HANDED. You can only fill the reservoir from the right - so I had to switch hands to pour in the water with my right hand."
3,Quite pleased.....so far.,"We've owned the Fast Brew for about a month of heavy usage (3-4 pots per day) and so far everything has been great. It brews quickly and extracts maximum flavor from the coffee. It does, however, have its' irritations: the LCD clock is next to impossible to see in most all levels of lighting which makes it a bit frustrating to program the auto brew; the water level window is also hard to read in all but bright light; and the opening in which you pour water is small and takes careful aim. It's a great machine if all you want is good coffee hot and fast and don't mind some design flaws that might test your patience. Based on brewing and temperature I'd give it 5 stars, but have to scale the rating back to account for its shortcomings."
1,Morning suprises,"12/03Pros of the Melitta Fast Brew Coffeemaker:brews coffee fastthe coffee is tastyCons:The fresh smell of coffee wakes you up each morning. Wanting a cup immediately, I go into the kitchen ane there it is, all over the floor and counter, only two inches in the pot with the grounds floating in it. That is the most frustrating thing that has happened.The reservoir's location and size need improvements. I use a soda bottle to pour water in. If you try using the pot which comes with it to pour water in, a lot of the water will get in the container for the coffee grounds.Today, my heating element stopped working. I think it has to do with these morning surprises.I plan to take it back to Target today. I am hoping I can get something different, but I will probably have to get the same one again. we, will see. Have a happy holiday."
2,Not Recommended,"After about 6 weeks it simply stopped brewing coffee. It pretended everything was OK - all the right lights came on etc. but it didn't push the water through the system.I took it back to target, who exchanged it for a new one, which lasted 18 months before developing the same fault.While it was working, it brewed decent coffee (and pretty quickly, too). However, the ""drip-stop"" mechanism is a bit dodgy - if the caraffe isn't perfectly in place, it prevents the water coming out into the carafe, and consequently you get it all over your kitchen counter. Due to the proximity of the fill hole and the filter basket, you also get grounds in the tank.I'd suggest looking at other machines - I replaced mine with a Braun Aroma Deluxe (same price); after three months, no complaints."
3,"Great Album, But About Those Alternate Takes...","it would have been nice if the ""Powers That Be"", whoever they are, had also put the original album cuts of ""In Marsovia"", ""Down In Dear Marsovia"" and ""Vilia"" on this CD and not just the alternate takes of these 3 songs. The absence of the album cuts of these 3 removes 2 stars from an otherwise great CD."
5,A masterpiece,"Nine years after her last album and just three months after being freed from her unfair 5 year stay in jail, Gloria Trevi comes back to music with her best album yet. Gloria left bad moments behind, picked up her experiencies and reflects her growth through 12 songs that go from rock to pop to sweet ballads. Her voice sounds stronger than ever, and she is still rebellious, untamed (listen to ""el domador""), angry, sweet and nostalgic at the same time. She dedicates tracks to her son (""Como nace el universo)"", Sergio Andrade (""Eres un santo""), machismo (""Nieve de mamey""), presidents (""Senor presidente""), her mother (""Metida hasta el cuello""), her late daughter (""Timbres postales al cielo"") and even jail (""Horas tranquilas""). This is probably her most biographical album to date and definitley her best."
3,Love of lloyd,"OK if you want to visit Lloyd's roots but if your looking for the good stuff try any of the CD's w/ Billy Higgins. (Hyperion, The Water Is Wide, etc....)"
2,Seemed largely ineffective,"I bought some of these along with some Victor Insect Magnets [...] and placed both around the house in various places. After 3+ months some of the victor traps had caught 1 or 2 roaches, but none of the Black Flag ones had. It could have just been bad luck (maybe I just happened to put the Black Flag ones where we didn't have roaches) but I'll follow the evidence and just buy the Victor ones from now on."
2,I've seen better roach traps,"Here in Hawaii, we've got these roach traps that look to be imported from Asia. They're fairly ubiquitous, and you don't see brands like this very often. I ordered this on Amazon just to give it a shot, to compare its efficacy in luring roaches to their doom in the glue. It's not very effective.When I placed this into a particular roach laden area, I had about 4 captures over a one week period. The Hoy Hoy (import) trap had at least three times that. While the import trap is more troublesome to assemble, I don't feel that this was a very good value."
5,I love it! The roaches...not so much,I like this product.It smells like pancake syrup. The roaches hate it. The roaches check in but can't check out!
2,Haven't caught American cockroach but...,"I have (at least) several American cockroaches (the giant ones). They come into the kitchen through our garage. Thought I'd lay some of these cheaply priced traps down to catch some of them. Haven't caught any yet and it's been over 2 months (or longer). Not sure they're attracting any of the giant cockroaches; haven't yet tried baiting the traps but may help. However, have caught many little geckos (or lizards?). So if you have a problem with geckos/lizards, here's your solution. I'm giving 2 instead of 3 stars because I'm a little disappointed to not have caught any roaches; but their price-cheapness offsets any real disappointment I may have."
1,doesn't work,"Doesn't really work, I put these up 2 weeks ago and haven't seen much of an improvement. I have seen roaches run in there and run back out, which just shows that the glue they are supposed to get stuck in doesn't work. It doesn't lure them either. I put 2 of these in my tiny kitchen and one of them is completely empty. Might as well put some glue and a paper and sprinkle with sugar. About the same effect. But free."
4,Take a look inside!,"I bought a box of Roach Motels to trap the cockroaches that were taking over my basement and was surprised at how quickly they worked! I looked inside, hoping to see sad and sorry cockroaches thinking about what they did.I was instantly disappointed. These are not the maximum security roach jails the packaging would have you think.Inside one of these ""motels"" I found cockroaches lounging around a swimming pool, drinking out of tiny coconuts. A group of lady roaches was getting kelp facials and massages by the beach. There were AT LEAST SIX ELEVATORS.I thought these roaches were getting punished for trespassing on my property, like they deserve. Instead, I just paid for their luxury vacation at a five-star resort."
2,True Value's description is wrong,"The description for the True Value offer shows 12 roach motels. Only 2 are included in each package. After several e-mails to True Value's customer service were never replied to, called True Value's customer service rep to ask when I would receive the missing product, she explained that the offer had a mistake in it. She offered to refund the price of the order rather than ship the product as described. I recieved a credit for the product, but not the shipping. It has taken me several calls to Amazon to get the credit for the freight. This has been a very frustrating process to go through."
3,Overpriced but probably effective.,"My apartment building reached that august age when the cockroaches start coming in after a wet summer. Age of building + urban + weather ='s cockroaches was news to me. I bought a bunch of products, including this one. It's basically a box that contains two smaller boxes. If there's bait scenting or something in the box I couldn't smell it. Basically the smaller boxes contain glue on them. You are paying for two small boxes with glue in them. I bought some Mexican thing at the same time, cost 1/5th as much (something like that). The Mexican one caught a roach, this one did not. I give it 3 stars for concept, finish, and promising youth."
4,the price is right!,I wanted a backgammon set to use with my children. Plus or minus $10 is exactly where I wanted to be but didn't hold out much hope. This set is really very nice - well set up and usuable. I didn't expect to get this nice a set for the money.
5,Relief Secured!,"We are very pleased with the Kidde detectors: installation is easy and the features are terrific! Having lived with nuisance alarms for ten years, the best feature of these is the ""silencing"" of nuisance alarms and quickly finding the offender. I've spent too much time dashing around the house with my nose pointed upward, only to hear the chirping start up in the basement!"
2,spurious alarms,"Ordered nine of these smoke alarms last summer, replacing older units. We haven't had a fire, so I can't say how well they work in that scenario, but we had to replace one of them after about a year because it started sounding brief alarms for no reason in the middle of the night. Since all nine are interconnected, they all sounded. It was rather unsettling. The replacement has been fine so far, but a couple of days ago another unit initiated one brief spurious alarm, so now I'm keeping my eye on that one."
4,Let's Hope We Don't Use Them!,"I guess I won't really know how well these units work unless or until I have a fire! Let's hope I don't have to find out! Thay arrived promptly and in excellent shape. The backup 9 volt battery was included, which surprised me."
5,Great product. I am very satisfied.,Had a problem with my smoke detectors at home. I could not find replacements at three stores that I called. Ordered new Kidde smoke detectors from Amazon. I received them and installed them. Had not had a problem since.
4,A good replacement,"I bought a total of five of these alarms to replace the ones that came with my house about 12 years ago. The old ones still seem to work, but they had yellowed and one of them started to go off for no apparent reason. The new ones seem to work well and appear to be the correct replacement. They sure look a heck of a lot better. I haven't had to rely on them so far, so that's why I couldn't give them five stars."
2,Ok so far ... Kidde's customer service is definitely not,"I had a house full of Kidde 1275 smoke alarms, and after several malfunctions (including one electrical problem causing it to literally ""go up in smoke""), I replaced them with the i12040 ... only because I wanted something that would ""drop in"" with the current mounting system and wiring. That they did, and I've had no false alarms in the month they've been installed.Why the 2 stars? Previous to purchasing, I contacted Kidde (via their customer service web page) to ensure the i12040 units had the same mounting system as the old 1275's and to ensure the wiring would be compatible with all the Kidde alarms on the system. Kidde never responded. I found out from a do-it-yourself web forum that these would work fine.Kidde's customer support is notoriously poor. The old 1275 units were deficient in design and/or manufacture - and Kidde refused to acknowledge this. I won't give high marks to a company that won't respond to customer service issues."
5,No Chirps!,I replaced my 1275's with these i12040's a/c the 1275's were 7 years old and after I had chg'd batteries and cleaned all 5 units I still got intermittent chirps(2am lol)So after some investigation I read on Amazons reviews these were replacements for the 1275's(and i didn't have to change out the mounts) Ive had them installed now for a couple of months and I'm completely satisfied
1,No Customer Support,I purchased three of these for a basement addition. They would not work with my older Kidde detectors and the customer support did not respond to several inquiries. I purchased another brand and replaced every detector in my house. I cannot recommend Kidde products because of this lack of support.
5,Nice product,Nice product at a greaat price. I was looking to stat replacing my 9 year old smoke detectors aNd wanted somthing that would pug in and go.
1,false alarms is what these should be called,"This is my second set of Kidde smoke detectors. These were an updated version and rated to be good with few false alarms. Wrong. Really wrong. Within a few days of putting them up one started alarming. Repeatedly. I took it down. I took the battery out. Put it back up. Good for a few day, and it started alarming. Took it down. On battery only, it seems to never alarm. Now the upstairs one started the same thing. The basement one has never alarmed. I am sending all of them back. I don't care if I get any refund. I am never going to buy another Kidde product."
2,didn't fit over old model,I bought this to replace a 12 year old smoke detector make by Firex. I believe Kidde purchased them. I needed an adapter to make it able to connect to the old style adapter but then the mounting holes were located different and I ended up not using it at all.
3,Alarm didn't work after 8 months,"It keeps beeping after 8 months. Replaced to the specified battery according to the menu, installed to the spot that has a working alarm and vacuum clean didn't work. Kidde will ship a new within 2 weeks.Latest updateReceived a new one and it work fine for a month. I had to replace the carpet downstair with hardwood floor. During replacing, it kept beeping and I had to disconnect the alarm. A week later, I tried to clean and put it back and it kept beeping. No matter how you clean it up, it just kept beeping as soon as you install it. I won't buy this type of alarm any more. I guess the dusty environment kill it. I had 3 other alarms, the older type, and it works fine."
5,Perfect fit replacement,"The 11 year old detectors currently in my house are Kidde Model 1275. Looking to replace them (Manufacturer and most Fire codes recommend new every 10 years), I found that the Model 1275 is no longer made and it really was not clear from the product description if the i12040 was an EXACT replacement. It is. It was REALLY easy to install. In fact, the base of the old 1275 and the new i12040 were the same as were the wiring connectors. I replaced the mounting bases on mine (Took about three minutes each) only because the originals had discolored over time. Each old detector out and new one installed, including changing the base, in about five minutes with just a screwdriver to remove and replace the base mounting screws. It took me longer to get my ladder out that it took to do the switch."
1,Cheap Cheap,"After just 3 years, my Kidde ionization smoke alarm began chirping. Same thing happened to the previous ones I owned. I replaced the battery and vacuumed it as best I could. Still keeps chirping. It is supposed to last 10 years. I will not buy this model again."
1,Kidde i12040 replacements false alarms,"Like many reviewers, we replaced old Kidde 1275s giving false alarms, with new Kidde i12040s since they were easy to install in the existing wiring. After about a year, one of the new units started with false alarms. Same time (3am), same room (bedroom). It's entirely possible there is some weird atmospheric condition in the room causing the false alarms. How are you supposed to figure that out? For now, the offending unit is disconnected. It's a small house with several other units that (so far) have not caused any trouble other than join the problem unit in the false alarm. If the others start creating false alarms, we'll replace the entire system with another brand."
1,Where there is smoke??????,"I too had 8ea of the 1275's (approx. 8 years old), one of which nearly caught on fire! The inside circuit board is burned BLACK from overheating and popping a resistor. It actually got so hot it melted the white buzzer wire to the circuit board and discolored the top of the white housing! I emailed Kidde and got a stonewall of ""that is supposed to happen (the crispy burned circuit board)"", ""its out of warranty"", ""it was a power spike"", ""its near the end of it useful life"", etc. When I confronted them with the fact that if the unit had encountered a power spike, why are the rest of them okay and it didnt affect anything else in the house....at that point they simply stopped returning my emails. I am shopping for a different system to replace the Kidde CRAP, even if it means rewiring the house for a competitors system! I am turning the detector over to the Consumer Product Safety Commission for further evaluation. Buyer Beware!"
1,There are better products out there.,"It's been my experience that Kidde wired-in smoke alarms are prone to problems. One problem, chirping for no reason, happens at night, on weekends, and other times when you either cannot get help or have to take off work to deal with the problem."
4,Kiddie smoke alarms,It is a very good buy in view of price and functionality. It came with everything I needed including the battery. I shall recommend this product to everyone.
5,happy with purchase,"I needed to reconnect the *wires* because the ""plug"" connection wasn't identical to the detector model we had. Other than that, installation of our 5+ detectors went fine."
4,Great Product and works with existing hardwired system,"I bought a few of them as a replacement for my 7-year old CO / smoke hard-wired system, and as a previous owner of Kiddie products, the alarm performed as expected. I got back to reviewing them for other users, when I started replacing the batteries. Please read other reviews for in-depth details."
4,"So far, it's good......","I purchased the Kidde alarms to replace a couple of other ones hard-wired in my house. It was easy to install, and seemed to work properly after testing. the only thing i don't see, unless i did something wrong, is on my other alams, it had a green light that stayed constant which was reassurring it had power, and i don't know if this one has that feature, as i do not notice it.But, if you are replacing or installing new, it's fairly simply to install."
5,Easy as pie,Bought the Kidde i12040 units to replace existing compatible smoke alarms. Installed in 90 seconds each and replaced all 7 in the house. The former units were over 10 years old. The price was very affordable.
1,Up 1 month . . . and the false alarms began,"I purchased 4 of these to replace detectors that were 15 years old. Worst decision ever. I HATE these things. One month after they were installed they began going off one evening. No smokers, no one cooking, etc. They proceeded to go off 2 more times that night until we finally disconnected them. Two days later I come home from work to find the fire department at my house. The stupid things had been going off all day. The ""faulty"" detector was identified. I bought a good old fashioned battery operated one to replace it. I'm waiting for the others to fail now. Nothing is more nerve wracking then dealing with this."
4,Fire alarms works as expected,Bought these alarms as replacements for original alarms in a 12 year old house. They worked as expected. I would have given 5 stars except one unit's cover was mis-aligned. Defect was not serious enough to return the unit for replacement.In choosing a replacement alarm you have to be careful to select a model that is compatible with the rest of the system. I had purchased two of the same model number 4 years ago so was reasonably certain they would work.
5,Good replacement...,"We bought several of these to replace the smoke detectors in a house we were rehabilitating a couple of year ago. The detectors that were in place were yellow from age, and marginally functional. These look great and were quite easy to install. They are also a descendant of the originals so the wiring works together as intended. They are all functioning as advertised and so far the house hasn't burned down. Hard to give a better review than that."
4,Got 4 to replace..,"I got four of these to replace the kidde units i had in my house since they were compatible units. Easy install, tested and worked. Still fine after a few months."
5,So far so good.,"By biggest concern with this product was false alarms. My old alarms had been going off at random times, and 10+ years old-- which is why I needed to replace them. I've had two of these units installed for ~3 weeks and not one false alarm. After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to go with the the Kidde brand, vs. the First Alert I could buy locally. I was pretty proud of myself, as a female new to home improvement projects, that I was able to successfully install two of these without any issues. I have 4 more left to install. There were only 3 wires I had to worry about and it was just a matter of connecting them. I would recommend you have a wire stripper. The first one I installed without one (using a scissors to strip the wire), and borrowed a wire stripper from the neighbor to do the second one. I've since bought my own so I'm ready to do the last 4."
1,Another sleepless night due to a false alarm,"I've had it with the Kidde i12040. This is the 5th time that we've been woken up in the middle of the night by a screaming alarm. What you must realize is that it's not just a slightly loud sound, it's a screeching deafening sound. It woke my neighbors up. When this happens I literally jump out of bed and run in circles. Because all of the smoke detectors are connected, they all sound and you can't tell which one is the problem. We've just removed them all. The worst thing (as many of the reviewers have said) is that it has only happened in the middle of the night, between 1am-3am.This is a horrible product."
1,Ugh! These smoke detectors have been a nightmare!,Since we installed these smoke detectors in our new house they have gone off half a dozen times between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. Loved it when we had company and we could not turn them off...Finally took them all out!!!!!! Now gotta buy more! Wish I had read the reviews before buying!!!!!
5,Excellent value,"This a very reasonably priced and high quality product. It is made from solid materials and includes a wide range of features. The blades are sharp, the bits are magnetic, etc. Highly recommended."
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money - Get Robert Conley's Books,"Dear Reader,Don't waste your time or money on this bloated and not well written novel. In addition, McMurtry does know much about Cherokee history, and virtually nothing about Cherokee culture.Do yourself a favor and get both of Rober Conley's books (one each on Zeke and Ned). They are more concise, more accurate and much more enjoyable.McMurtry phoned this book in. He's a much much better writerthan indicated by this work."
3,Not McMurtry's best...,"Not a bad story, but I wonder when McMurtry is going to get the guts to write a novel all by himself again.The story was interesting, but not as entertaining as some of the others he has done. This book also uses the word, ""Vexing"" or an offshoot of that, more than any book I've ever read..."
4,"Whoops, I made a mistake!","Citizens of Fort Smith, Arkansas, please forgive my brain slip for not correctly identifying Ft. Smith as the location of the courtroom of the famous Judge Parker, the ""hanging"" judge of Arkansas. Visitors can even tour his courtroom and examine other artifacts of the period as I have done. And, if that is not enough, you can travel to Archer City, Texas to visit Larry McMurtry's hometown and the four bookstores he owns there called ""Booked-Up"". If he is in residence, he'll sign your copy of ""Ned and Zeke""."
3,"Typican McMurtry, but without the drama","Lots of violence and McMurtry's careful word picture of life and conflict amoung whites and indians after the civil war, but very predictible. As usual, you can easily conjure a picture of the people and get a sense of their lives which makes is worth the read."
4,Overall good,"I think there was a slow time in the beginning of the book, but a snowstorm forced me to continue. I am glad I finished the book because it was not a typical love story. It was very different. The main character I found as intriguing as the other characters in the book did. Leslie is very smart and I wonder how many people like her exist. The book is captivating and once it picked up, it didn't let go. The only other book I liked by this author is Flyy Girl."
2,Not a good book from Omar.,"This book was long and boring, I hoped that this would be like some of his early work, but I ended up being let down.This book that was to be a little scary and about voodoo had nothing to do with either one. All of the things that are happing in the book are things she is doing with her own two hands.the book just didn't flow"
1,It just gets worse,"Once again,I was rather disappointed in this novel. I started out a big fan of Omar Tyree's but this is ridiculous. His last great book was Just Say No, but this one was horrific. I didn't like the storyline at all, it was very slow and just idiotic. I'm not normally this hard on authors, but this was bad. I try to support Tyree's work but after this I can't continue to anymore. Sorry but this was a diappointment."
1,Attack of the Cliche,"I listened to this book on audio, and as far as I could tell it was one long, exhausting string of cliches liberally seasoned with the F word. Maybe he meant it to be -- to say that his characters think and talk in cliches like many people -- but here it served to make the whole thing rather annoying to listen to, and I felt embarrassed for the seemingly idiotic characters.I haven't read any of his other books, but this one is written in the manner of a linguistically challenged person describing a B movie in great detail to a friend.If you love cliches, you'll love this book - but unless the author meant it as a spoof on the overuse of cliche, it's hardly good writing."
4,Loved it!,"Some of the language was EXTREMELY STRONG...okay most of the language was extremely strong. However, it was a quick read that had a plot that kept me interested. It was suspenseful, and an unexpected delight."
4,Good Read,"I really enjoyed this book. It's the story of Leslie, a Haitian college student attending an HBCU. Leslie has had a rough life and is trying to better her life by attending college. She is a strong and determined to succeed. All of her family members look to her for support. When her mother calls her from her death bed, she revels to Leslie that her grandmother was an high priestess and that Leslie looks just like her. Leslie is estatic and doesn't know how to deal with this new revelation. She begins reading up on Vadou and starts taking things into her own hands when trouble comes knocking into Leslie's life.I gave this book 4 stars only because I didn't like the ending. Hopefully Mr. Tyree will give us a sequel."
1,I loved it!!,"In addition to Flyy Girl, I think this Omar Tyree's best books. When I first saw it in the library and read the description, I honestly didnt think that it would be something that I wanted to read, but I fell in love with it. The characters are urban, and I especially loved that, because there arent a lot of books that contain urban characters, especially horror stories, and I think that it was well written, entertaining, a real page turner; Omar Tyree tackled the concept of urban/horror like no other author has yet."
1,Absolutely Awful,"This book was absolutely awful, not sure if the other reviewers were reading the same book. If you like witchcraft and fairytales, this one is for you! Be Real, or at least Pretend To Be. The storyline, may have been okay without the witchcraft, or ""special powers"". I was truly disappointed."
5,One of Omar Tyree's Best!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. Omar Tyree took a different turn by writing a scary novel. The lead character Leslie is a beautiful Haitian girl who is attending Dillard University. Her life is very stressful due to her three roommates, her teenage mom of a sister, and a brother who let her down when in childhood. All together, life comes crashing down on her and the only way she thinks can solve her problems is to murder the ones who stand in her way of achieving peace in her life. This book will have you wanting to read more and more until you are at the edge of your seat."
3,Cool,This is a story about a young woman that has so much hate in her life that she feels that the only way to deal wiht all the hate is by getting revenge on anyone that crosses her path through vodoo.
2,Social Commentary? Supernatural?,"Omar Tyree had good intentions of writing an insightful look into the lives of the haves and have nots of black society. But, there is an excess of everything. An excess of characters, subplots, genres. I never felt like I knew or cared about any of the characters. Leslie justifies all of her actions by stating she just wants to be left alone. The voodoo plot is poorly examined and improbable. There are too many characters and too many viewpoints without explanation or motivation. The ending is inconclusive and begs for a sequel. Wait and read the sequel, you won't have missed much."
3,Good Read,"It was ok kinda slow at the beginning, it all came together at the end and i finshed it.It was such a sad story about the family.He showed the struggles that each one was dealing with. The book makes you think twice before you judge people. I hope their will be another book."
3,Stuck in the Middle,"I'm stuck in the middle trying to determin if this book was actually a good read or a waste of a few pages.Because this book isn't laced with the typical sexual energy that most books have - I'd say that it is interesting enough to capture and keep my attention. I did not get the VooDoo portion of the book, I'm not familiar with the religion voodoo but I'm sure that what Leslie was doing was not voodoo but cold blooded murder. She claim to be a high priestest yet nothing she did (except visualize a face or know the phone was about to ring) indicated that she was anything more than a selfish young girl wanting what was not for her!Over all, the book was intersting because you eagerly could not wait to see what she was up next.I did not like how the book ended, it left you hanging wondering what happened to any of them. I'm wondering was that part a cruel joke on Omar Tyree part"
1,Very Bad,"Leslie and Diary of a Groupie, Mr. Tyree's two most recent books have been horrible. Leslie was a terrible story that was too long and just seemed thrown together. There really was no reason for the murders to take place and the whole voodoo portion of the book was just thrown in there to add some spunk which didnt work. I'm glad I bought this book used, but still mad I even wasted [$$] on it."
5,Tyree's Best Work Yet,"This is a spectacular and unique work of fiction from Omar Tyree. Rich in complexity, characters, plot, social, and political commentary it is obvious that Omar has not only strengthened his style, but has also gained more depth as a writer. The only drawbacks to this newest work is that there is some explaining to be desired, especially in the section regarding the story Leslie's mother, Ann Marie tells her daughter of her Vadou priestess roots, and who are the mysterious Vadou priestess women who refer to Leslie as Isis The War Goddess, and what is their interest in her? Omar also leaves the reader with an antagonizing and haunting cliff hanger ending. Perhaps there is to be a part two? Still this work is strong, and brilliant, and will intrigue you from start to finish. Tyree earns 5 stars!"
2,dark and unrealistic,"i read this book- i thought omar missed the mark on this one- the storyline was dark without any real explanation as to why, it concentrated on the myth of voodoo and i never once felt connected to one of his characters. leslie was what- to who? the story was told from so many characters- the 3 roomates, her brother, father, sister and even her mother. my question, is ""who is leslie""- to the reader? was i to feel sorry for her strifes in early child hood? was this to justify the unreal acts of violence that peppered the book. (i did not think so) well, i 'll pass on the seasoning the next ime round... the book was preaching in one voice and justifying violence in another... i was perplexed to what the message was here... the story jumped about so often, i could not form a picture in my head who was who from the first chapter. this was not one of omar tyree's best books- not by a long shot."
4,A Somewhat Different Kind Of Book,"I wasn't pleased with the ending. It was tyree just decided ""Oh well, I'm tired. I'll just stop here"". He ended it right when it was getting interesting. I don't think the main character, herself, got to live up to her expectations. It was alright, but I know Omar could've done better"
1,Horrible,"This is my first Omar Tyree book and I am truly disappointed. I had heard that he has good books, but this one was a turn off for me. It was too simple; It almost seemed childish. The whole story line was so unbelievable. The characters were lame. I may try another one of his books, but I hope my next choice will help me get over the disgust I have with this particular book. Sorry Omar Tyree fans."
2,Very lazy work,"This book was very lazy. It just dragged on and oooooooooooon. I took a liking to the main character Leslie, but i wish i could put her in the hands of Toni Morrison or a better author and watch her blossom into a much better story. I was a little confused and disappointed with the ending. It was like Leslie was in the wrong story. There could have been so much more done with this character, but Mr. Tyree was too lazy to be creative. I ended up throwing the book away or giving it away, i dont even remember. Its just not sitting on my shelves."
4,Leslie,"I was pleasantly surprised when I read this novel. I guess I enjoyed it so much because I was expecting a lot less. When I have read Tyree in the past, I have hated it. Leslie however was great in that he left his normal comfort zone (sistah girl books I call them) and gave us something different. I loved the underlying plot of ""dark magic"", and I really enjoyed the struggle with the main character ""Leslie"" to find herself and love. I never hated her, I merely felt sorry for her. She was not the villian, as I am sure some think...she is really a survivor...one who experienced life, made bad choices and will survive although her underlying fragile psyche would not. Give this novel a chance, you will either love it or hate it, but no one that I suggested it to thought it was a waste of time. This novel will truly make you evaluate how if given the same circumstances you would respond."
2,Mildly Disappointing,I felt strained to complete this book. It took too long to bring the story together. By the time it got interesting enough to not put down it was over. What I would like to see is a sequel. But only if Leslie is still the main character and has beaten the charges against her. To see her learn about her powers and how to use them without all the wrongfully placed vengence would be good. The other priestess who recognized as the war priestess has a lot to offer. I felt there were too many loose strings left and the book had no closure.
3,Very informative both historically and culturally,"This book was very interesting to read. I am not sure what the final product reads but if it is anything close to the manuscript, it should be a book found on many enthusiasts shelves. Dr. Knez speaks first hand of the Korean culture and people."
5,Do The Hustle!,"Director Ethan Minsker has created a funny, sexy and gritty world for us to explore in his latest film ""The Soft Hustle"".Shot on location in New York City's Lower East Side and in Atlantic City, we follow the trials and tribulations of ""The Businessman"" (Omar Rojer), ""The Artist"" (Colin Burns) and ""The Florist"" (Jimmy Drago) who are trying to make it on the Lower East Side often with comedic results.With fine supporting performances by Christine Holt, Catharine Lyons, Heather Litteer, Heather Soto, Alison Ball and the director himself, this movie is fun to watch and deserving of a wide release.The kickin' soundtrack (which deserves it's own CD) features great music by ""Champions of Sound"" , ""The Goops"", and other great bands.Take time to enjoy ""The Soft Hustle""."
2,Don't buy this model.,"Very poorly written instructions. When instrudctrions figgured out, much to complicated and this expensive model does not meet my needs as well as much less expensive ones."
4,Slow shipper,"I had ordered the Dremels thru another Amazon merchant, and the 3/32"" collets from this one. I don't know if they were backordered or what, but I received the Dremels almost 2 weeks before the collets arrived!NOTE: You must order this special size 3/32"" collet if you want to use the Dremels with dental straight HP burs!"
4,Very pleasantly surprised,"So I read some AP article about the 10 most overlooked albums of 2006, and after reading a couple of online reviews wasn't expecting much.HOWEVER, what I found was a fledgling band that reminds me of a UK version of the Black Crowes, lots of blues fueling the music, but with very melodic vocal lines reminiscent of Travis from their ""The Man Who"" days and Toad the Wet Sprocket. Lyrics are well thought out, and hopeful, but of course contain the nowadays obligatory cliches.There are several notable tracks on this album:1. Silhouette: acoustic to hard rock, really moving song with a 60's southern country-rock feel.2. Light sleeper: haunting melody line that drifts along with the song, and it has a *gasp* key change!! Which is unheard of nowadays.3. Autumn Red: a 3:4 song that again has some great melodies.I would definitely recommend this album, nice and refreshing!"
4,decade-ence,"Driveblind is a unique blend of 60's and 70's rock-opera and current emotionally wrought angst with a hint of true insight. Definately not your mainstream lyrically or musically, but it has a great rhythm and melody. This album is perfect for those more eclectic collections or if you're looking for a change!Why am i so generous with the stars? Well - i figure with the fact that over a month later it is still in my cd player in my truck - it must be a really great album - however it doesnt make a 5 because I can turn it down or off on ocassion. I love this album and I am really excited about the band - but there are just a couple of tracks on this 12 set c.d. that I can take or leave, that are just a little too cliche for such a dynamic and creative band.Definately looking forward to more of their work!"
2,horrible match of singer and material,"Liz has a nice voice, but is too shrill and operatic for this material. The arrangements are really horrible, too. THey really bring down the whole album. I'd like to hear Ms. Callaway with better accompaniment and material more suited to her style."
3,Soul is the Key Word Here...,"Our Kind of Soul IS Daryl and John's soul statement. Unfortunately,I was searching for the classic Hall'N Oats sound. This isn't it. I'll give it a 3 because I was the knucklehead who thought (for some reason) that they would sing some of their favorites. It's still Hall'N Oats: just not hits we've come to love. (Well, they DO sing hits, but they're old Motown R&B; soul hits... which is sort of what the title says.)EJ"
5,Talk about a Mighty Fine example of WHAT IT IS!,"Now I don't know about you, but I've seen this concert in all of its High Definition Brilliance, and it's nothin' less than a cryin' shame that it hasn't yet been released on Blu-ray in 1080p!In the meantime I'll hold tight to this Totally Rock Solid DVD, but Common H&O;! Let's get somebody out there to GET IT ON HD! I'm polishin' up my pixels, got my cash in hand, and I'm ITCHIN' to buy!"
2,music are louder than singing,"I am disappoint of sound quality, Better off getting early version of Dary Hall & John in the 80 or 90"
5,This is The Best!,"You know that Hall & Oates just seem to get better and better as time goes on!!! I Love every song on this DVD:) I know that you will, too....."
4,"Best ""Dirty Love""","I know that very few fans nominate this as No.1. But Vinnie's Drumming on ""Dirty Love"" is really fantastic & amazing. I love it."
2,This one is not so good.,"Out of the 4 YCDTOSA cds I own, this one is the suckiest. The first disc is all pretty much sucky except for maybe 3 or 4 songs. The second disc has some good stuff, but not much. If you're gonna get a YCDTOSA cd, get 1,2,or 4, the other YCDTOSAs that I own. They are all awesome. You Can't DO That On Stage Anymore vol.6, do ya sef a favum peepuhs, don't use it!"
4,more great concert snippets,"This is maybe the weakest of the series, it's still really good; There are too many songs on disc1, and too much spoken word conceptual continuity stuff like the poodle lecture and is that guy kidding. emperor of ohio and stuff like that is great.the 84 band stuff is very cool and magic fingers is very cool. dirty love is super, father oblivion is good. on cd2 a great enema bandit and solo. brilliant bits of L shankar, thirteen, take your clothes off when you dance. lobster girl-swell. turning again is swell too. strictly genteel has some great playing, great tune.and of course black napkins rules the universe. worth getting Thank you"
5,Keeping your sense of humor in check,"The panty sniffing contest is CLASSIC!!!!Anyways, besides the obvious humor in subject matter, the musician ship is stellar!!!!"
5,"GREAT FOR 6,7,AND 8th GRADE.","This book was so good I couldn't put it down!This book was mainly about a girl named Sabrina Wells.She has just moved up to the middle school.There are lots of new people there that she does'nt even know.She has a enemy of couse who she calls:""Stacy the Great"", but also she has some great friends named:Katie Cambell,Allison Cloud,and a new girl from New York named Randy Zac. What boy will she decide to take to the Homcoming Dance?You will have to read this story to find out.I would give this book 5 stars any day!!"
2,hmmmm,"Well it definitely makes you feel more ""awake"" but I felt like I was breathing heavy every time I took this. As if I was excited or something. Not sure if it works or not. I certainly didnt lose any weight, which is why I tried it after reading about it in a magazine. Maybe ya have to stick with it longer than I did or something."
3,effective but not durable enough for daily wear,"I got these to help cut down the dust bunnies in my apartment, which has hardwood floors. They do a great dusting job, but if you wear them every day, they will not last. The yarn fringe tends to get stuck in things, or you accidentally catch one foot's slipper with the other foot's slipper. The result is that one of them already has a torn sole. I don't think they were sewn together very strongly. It is possible they can last if you only wear them occasionally, but don't try to wear them as houseslippers."
1,A Good Idea Gone Bad,These slippers are a total waste of money. It's too bad because it's a good idea and could have been effective. A few more cents spent during manufacture could have made the difference. Talk about quality control. I wore the slippers for approx. half and hour while walking on a tile floor in my house. The cheap plaid material used for the sllipper's top quickly pulled loose from the stitching to the bottom mop section. It appeared to be a combination of slippery fabric and the material being too close to the stitches so that it EASILY pulled out. Buyer beware.
3,just a funny cheesy gift.,"friend got new hard wood floors, couldn't resist. who knows if she'll ever use.or maybe re gift- That is what I'd do."
3,Gag gift,"We had seen this item advertised locally and thought it would be a great gag gift. The local outlets carried very limited inventory and were slow to reorder. We placed an order through Amazon and received quick delivery, although it resulted in a higher price with the included shipping fees."
4,wheel bearings,"I'm not sure what to right about wheel bearings, either they work or they don't.. working good so far!thanks!"
5,Hard to find..,"I always have a hard time finding this in the beauty chains/salons in my area, so it was nice to know I could find it on Amazon along with (almost) eveything else. It's good to have for polish that is too thick, increases drying time."
3,Could be better,I used this thinner on a lot of old polishes and it restored about 2/3 of the ones that I used it on. It's very easy to use and it does work on even really old nail polish as long as it's not completely dried out or extremely thick and globby. I did have to add a lot of drops for the polishes and I probably added around 20 to the majority of bottles. It didn't change the quality or finish of the nail polishes.
2,ineffective,I must've put at least 15 drops into one of my bottles of polish before I saw any difference at all.
4,Great Parenting Book,The authors explains the 7 worst things parents do:Baby Your ChildPut Your Marriage LastPush Your Child INto Too Many ActivitiesIgnore Your Emotional or Spiritual LifeBe Your Child's Best FriendFail to give Your Child StructureExpect Your Child to Fulfil Your DreamsI rated it 4 stars because I felt that the topics weren't throughly discussed on how we can avoid falling in one of the 7 traps.
5,Education dilemma between parents solved!,"My husband and I had very different point of views concerning education... We agreed on how to raise our son, but he felt a lot of guilt in disciplining is 9 year old who never had any rules, structure, and boundaries in her young life. This book helped him understand that discipline equals love and explained the ABC of parenting very well by showing the direct effect of behaviors through simple examples. We all fall into pitfalls trying to do our best, but it can be hard sometimes and this book reinforce our conviction that we are our children's guides and we must prepare them to live in society."
4,A very informative and friendly book.,"It sure does help to know you are not alone when you are trying to survive the times your children are acting like teenagers! I had a few good chuckles with this book, and I learned a lot too. Most of all, it made me feel maybe I'm not such a rotten mom after all."
3,"Interesting, but not very relevant","I bought the book hoping to get some good advice, things to watch out for, or at least some interesting examples from the authors' clients' lives, but it was somewhat boring. I didn't feel like it had many useful tips for me, a parent of a 3 year old. I'll keep the book handy and check it now an then to see if I've fallen into any of the patterns mentioned, but, for me, not a great book."
4,Good CD But,Don't get me wrong. This is a great CD but I think his other live stuff is better. Glad to have in my collection
1,HAVE SOME FROSTING WITH YOUR BUTTER,"I found this frosting pretty disgusting. And I'm not one to be very likely to put the words ""frosting"" and ""disgusting"" in the same sentence. It ended up tasting mainly like butter. When I scraped it off into the sink, it just stayed in one clump and wouldn't even rinse down the sink very easily (like you'd expect from butter). And even if you like the taste of a bunch of butter on your cake, save yourself some money. The only ingredients in this mix are powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt. You can buy all those very cheaply and still add all the butter the directions call for (2.5 sticks!). Gross!"
2,"Make your own, this isn't worth it","I didn't read the ingredients or directions before I bought this and all it really is, is confectioners sugar and butter. Don't bother with this mix, just buy confectioners sugar and butter."
2,"lot's of outside quotes, but plenty of needs","Melrose Larry Green's book is full of quotes. Quotes and information used to back up points are good things. He appears to have researched by surfing the Internet, watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others. This is all fine and acceptable.The problem with ""Why the Clintons Belong in Prison"" is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative, which is sporadic, jumpy and poorly edited. His points are not linear, and show the author's attention deficit. With a proper literary team, this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a ""hit and run"" report and reads like a one-sided sensationalized talk radio program."
5,This book is a MUST OWN for any biographer of the Clintons,"The information contained in this book is excellent. You will find many golden nuggets in here - such as the fact that longtime Clinton insider Larry Nichols told Melrose Larry Green that Chelsea Clinton is the biological daughter of Webb Hubbell NOT Bill Clinton.You will also find what Hillary said about wanting to have sex with Webb Hubbell so she could make partner at the Rose Law Firm.Both of those things are absolutely true. You have to understand how wildly dysfunctional the Jerry Springer-type ""marriage"" the Clintons had.By the way, I am the nation's #1 anti-Hillary activist. I probably have EVERY book ever written on the Clintons. They are 100% trash who will literally beat up someone to get ahead (Gary Johnson 6/26/92).If you want to learn something new or if you are a biographer of the Clintons or if you have an interest in politics, BUY THIS BOOK!"
4,Great Addition,Lots of useful information. Not a complete growers guide but definitely a help. It's a great addition to my collection of gardening guides.
3,good but not great,"its just another remake of the same old books. soma is a good breeder and he has some useful tips , but there are better books out there on the subject."
5,Very easy to understand and great images,"This book is a great help. I have used it various times already. It is very easy to understand and has great graphics for help. This book was helpful selecting seeds, and telling me the best time to harvest. This book helped me learn how to grow a garden without using chemicals like all the gardens. I highly recomend this book to beginers and to advanced gardeners."
4,Soma Review,I was pleasantly surprised that a such a small book could deliver so much information. I have yet to discover a better book on Organic Cannibis cultivation. Even if you are not growing in Soil or totally organic it will still give you some great growing ideas.
4,Pure dirt,Even though I have extensive experience with gardening techniques and methods this little book renews not only the technical but the personal connection we have with the natural world. Good vibes and information on organic methods for any plant.
3,Should have included more from the movie,"The soundtrack suffers from cheesy synths and poor midi instruments which I didn't notice in the movie (which is amazing, mind you). They should have included some of the Perez Prado stuff they used for the dancing drag queens, which would have rounded this out perfectly.Not a great soundtrack by any standards, and kind of dull compositionally."
1,"Spend a little more, get a better quality one",I bought this card for Media Center 2005 largely for it's price and it was on the MS partner list. DVI does not go through this card correctly and I thought I had a defective dvi port on the tv. I eventually borrowed a friend's ATI 9600XT and it worked perfectly. I kept this card too long before testing to return. AVOID this one (may be the brand)!
5,fantastic tool,We had recently replaced half of our porch floor with out this tool and it was very hard work taking 2 people.After taking 2 people 2 days to finish half the floor. I had ordered the Bo-Wench. To finish the other half. It took 2 of us only half a day to replace the other half of the porch floor then after my help left I decided to pull up the half of the floor that was done the week end before and put it back down with the Bo-wrench to tighten up all the joints. and was able to put the other half down in just a few hours. A time save and money saver. I would recommend this to anyone that has ever tried to put in a warped board.
2,Not the most helpful tool in the shed,I purchaed the BoWrench and Tongue & Groove Cam to help me install vaulted ceilings and vertical walls. I found the tool too heavy to use over head and likely to slip and fall if I didn't keep constant pressure on the handle--even after it was locked in place.
5,Short Lived Classic,"I agree with the previous reviewer - it is a shame this CD is already out of print. This is an outstanding mix of Christmas songs with some real stand outs. From a genre that can get old fast, this CD always sounds fresh and never fails to satisfy."
5,Santa Baby I have luckily made a legal copy of you.,The whole family is singing to this right now. This CD has brought so many good times to our family during the holiday season! I will not have another Christmas without it. I agree with all the top review. It has brought some good memories while opening presents. There will be no Christmas blues if you purchase this CD. Have a wonderful Christmas and Happy New Year!
3,Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness monster is a hit with one kid but not the other,My 7 year old does not like this movie but my 5 year old loves it. Go figure. I love all of the Scooby Doo movies and have 17 now. If you ask me you can't go wrong with Scooby and the gang!
4,scooby hits scotland,"Scooby and the gang go to Scotland to Daphne's cousin's castle at Blake Castle for the highland games. The monster sightings in the beginning are very extravagant with it destroying whole sections of the castle as it chases Shaggy and Scooby when they look for a midnight snack. Once the rest of the gang decides it is real, the sightings are a lot more normal. My two year old asks for the ""bagpipe Scooby"" when he wants to watch it. He and his little brother think it is a lot of fun to watch. Other than the first sighting, it does not seem scarey at all. It is perfect for the whole family."
1,it was confusing when I purchased it...it ended up being a download,having some issues with some of my purchases and downloading...so will be calling cust. service this week. Hopefully can get resolved
4,i passed!,the types of questions in this book were very similar to those on the exam...i would definitely suggest it...i just found out last week that i passed!
4,Great Book,"Just took my exam a month ago and this was then only book I purchased. I would recommend this book to anyone who is preparing for the NBCOT exam. The CD in the back of the book is nice to have, but I found the book itself to work better."
5,Review,"Service was very good, they were quick to answer any questions and to ship. As for the product, its in great shape and like new. I recommend them."
5,Best study tool for the OT exam,"I used this, the NBCOT study guide, and the OT Review and Study Guide from International Educational Resources to study for my exam. This was by far the most effective tool to study with. The questions were similar to the ones on the exam, and the explanation of the answers was thorough. I passed! I recommend this book!"
1,Not a true representation of complexity of NBCOT test questions,"I worked through all 800 questions and then attempted the NBCOT online practice test and was shocked at the difference in questions. The 1 line and straight-forward questions in this study guide do not prepare a person for the clinical reasoning required for NBCOT questions, and I felt like I had just wasted 2 weeks of study time on this guide. I bought the Rita Fleming study guide after this one and feel it is a much better study guide with more challenging questions, and best of all has a thorough review of information included with the study guide."
5,Excellent resource,Great book to prepare for the OT exam. Found it extremely helpful to get used to the style of test questions. Would high recommend...I passed on my first try!
1,Proof that P.T. Barnum was correct.,"Only the clueless will understand this book. However, if you have a clue, it's actually quite humorous. A highly deserving winner of last years Ig Nobel Prize at MIT (for the second time)."
5,All About War Profiteering,"Everyone knows that war is evil, deadly, horrible, etc. However, what some may not know is that war is also very mercenary - much of war is about a relatively few making huge amounts of money. The author writes a book explaining the war profiteering and corruption behind the war in Iraq. The author recently did an author event on C-Span2 BookTV which was very enlightening and added to the information in the book."
3,Very cute lunch bag but a little small,"My preschooler uses this lunch bag occasionally. Only reason is we can't fit his water bottle in this lunch bag. It is rather shallow and actually space is quite tight to put a balance meal in this bag. If you plan on putting peanut butter sandwich and a small drink or use zip lock bags to store snacks, then it is fine. However, I do use containers to store fruits/vege, main lunch, snacks and a drink. Often times, I use a thermos to store my preschooler's food and most thermos will not fit in this. Other than that, it's a very cute lunch bags. It is well insulated. I still use it to carry an ice pack and 1 yogurt in the bag for my son when i pick him up from school."
2,Fell apart,This thing lasted less than 2 minutes. Maybe I used it for the wrong application but in my opinion it should have been more durable than it was.
5,Wonderful Childhood Story Book,I had this book as a child. My Mom read the stories at bedtime and I'll always love this. The books condition was just as I was told. They shipped it SUPER fast! Great service!
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I obsessively acquired the entire YCDTOSA set. But for some reason didn't get this until last. Karma was trying to protect me. There's just something missing from this one. The first disc feels like Uncle Meat outtakes, and the second just lacks focus. As much as I think Vol 2 is the greatest of the set, Vol 5 is the worst. This is the one that feels like left overs, he seems to have known how we wanted to end the collection, and this volume got stuck with the things he wanted to include but didn't know where."
5,Zappa-The Best Songwriter of the 20th Century,We all know Zappa is the man- any doubts? Listen to What's New in Baltimore
3,Newcomers to Zappa please abstain,"For those of us who are diehard Zappa fans, this volume of YCDTOSA is very interesting. It its FZ's way to prove to us that, whatever we say, the 82 band was musically light years ahead of our beloved original Mothers.Disc 1 is devoted to the (nearly) original band from 69. If you know your Zappa, you'll be pleased to hear yet another version (under a different name) of the Gas Mask, or some wonderful Garret Theater type sessions, or even a King Kong without the theme. I would say this is only for the initiated who will appreciate the coarse subtelties (if you allow the contradictory statement) of the time. Roy Estrada at his yelling best.Disc 2 is fully devoted to the wondeful musicianship of the 82 band. Absolutely impeccable even when having syringes thrown at them. Just listen to the Black Page.Not a begginers' record."
5,Disk 2 is a hidden treasure,This CD seems like FZ wanting to never ever be reminded again on the early Mothers - although they were ahead of their time. But just listen to the perfectness and tightness of the 82-Band on Disk 2 making pieces like 'Moggio' sound like if it was child's play. Stunning!!!
5,Great book. You see the world differently after reading it.,"In ""Silent Witnesses,"" Jacqueline Ellis shows the flip-side of the Depression. Working class lives, all too often been depicted in sentimental blacks and whites, are here given a full range of expression. Rage, resentment, and even revolution become part of the equation. Through clear and often entertaining language, Ellis shows how these ""negative"" impulses were purposefully squelched in official government representations of working class women. To suppress the threat, the government denied its existance. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at Dorothea Lange's ""Migrant Mother"" the same again. This is the best kind of book -- one that makes you see the world differently after you read it."
5,this is the brand for me.,i've tried other brands of St. Johns Wort. This is the only brand that seems to work for me. SOLGAR Please don't stop producing this product. I am finding harder and harder to locate.
2,Disappointing,"The author's strong clinical orientation makes her descriptions of cases and clients fascinating and insightful. Unfortunately, most of the book is devoted to the angst she suffers unrelentingly for 20+ years. There is little indication that she achieved much emotional growth during this time. One is left with the impression that she would have been a happier, healthier person had she chosen to work with incest clients as a private therapist rather than a county social services employee. This book describes one woman's emotional journey, but is not a good representation of actual work within the child protective services system. The book also would have benefited from a good editor and a decent spellcheck program. Misspellings and grammatical errors abound, and in at least two instances lilac bushes bloom in the late summer. The author even manages to misspell the name of her favorite 1980's Boulder restaurant."
5,Truthful,"This is by far, the best book i have ever read. It was so truthful and im possitive it opened the eyes off all the sheltered people out there. I read a review from a women on here about ""FIRE OF FIVE HEARTS"" and she said that the author, holly smith, had no place to write it because she had never been incested. But just because she has never been incested doesnt mean she cant help people with it. Do people who help depression need to be depressed? or do people who treat alcoholism need to be alcoholics? absolutley not.Therefore, i think its a wonderful book to read, and it will open your eyes to a part of the world you will never know. And for Holly Smith, keep writing your books, because people out there need you to survive."
5,Always and Never Surprised,"I met Holly prior to her book being published at a retreat and in an instant was intrigued by her. Having only spent 3 days with her at the retreat, this book is true to her character of compassion, dedication, and role model.As an advocate for 7 years I found it difficult to read this book for all the emotions I was experiencing. I think Holly has found a true balance in her writing of head and heart - with an overtone of soul. In which I view as a reflection of the personal growth she has done within her job and for her job.I felt the book held integrity for those who are survivors and those who are humbled by survivors. I would recommend this book especially for those who work in this field where our response to trauma is often taboo. She says what so many of us feel."
3,Moderately Good,"This book is interesting enough to keep the readers attention. i liked, not loved it."
3,wears out too fast,I guess Dremel makes their money by selling accesories that doesn't come in the 100 piece packages. These work great and are easy to use. They just wear out incredily fast.
3,wears out quickly,"bought these for use sharpening my chainsaw blade and each stone wore out after a handful of sharpenings each. altho they worked well, they should not have wore out so quickly."
4,the stones of the Gods grind slowly,"but exceeding fine. Sharpening a chainsaw tooth with this and my Dremel is actually pretty easy. Be sure to get the right size for your particular chain. If you aren't sure, ask the vendor, or, the Oregon people who are the leading lights in the chainsaw maintenance and innovation trade.Anyway, with this, I can easily avoid a 20 mile round trip and a $10 sharpening fee. A new chain is less than $20 if you shop carefully, Sharpening is easy and saves a whole bunch of money.I actually needed the 7/32 wheel, but these worked enough to keep me going until I figured out the bigger wheel was better."
2,Saucers Stay Grounded,It can't have been easy to make a dull documentary about such a colourful and unusual subject but Robert Stone succeeded. I was not overly impressed with his Oswald's Ghost but that film had visual flair. This effort is drab and predictable on every level. It looks and feels like a cheap news feature on a local TV channel. I don't believe in UFO's but have always found the subject fascinating yet I had to force myself to finish this documentary.
4,Thick but good,"Andy Lo is one of the best minds in quant investing out there right now, and I should have expected this to be a challenging read. But it was a little heavy on the calculus even so. Thankfully it's well written enough that you can take the math for granted and still get a lot out."
3,Difficult read but worth it,"It is always nice to see confirmation of one's basic viewpoints in print. Those seeking a simple trading program will be dissappointed in the technical nature of the arguement. However, those not put off by a mathematical thesis will find some real jems in the text."
3,Basically valuable...,"It is always a good sign when the results of academic research begin to confrim what the actual practitioners already know to be true...as does this book. Although this book is clearly aimed at PHD types, rather than the investment professional, the basic theme of it is of value-and the admission of non-randomness is revolutionary."
4,Very mathematical,This book is a collection of papers that seek to disprove the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). The book is very mathematical and statistical. I have not checked the validity of the proofs so you should take my rating with a grain of salt and study the book for yourself. My rating of this book is based on my personal belief that EMH is an oversimplified and incorrect theory cooked up by academics with little market-experience and I found the argumentation of this book compelling overall.This book is available for download free of charge on Princeton's webpage.If you like a less demanding 'counter-proof' of EMH I can recommend Warren Buffett's essay entitled 'The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville' which is also available on the internet.
3,A bit technical,"After reading A Random Walk, I was expecting another easy, entertaining read. This turned out to be much more technical. Even with a fairly strong statistics background, I still got lost. The style is much more dry. It's not written for the general public like A Random Walk is."
1,Completely inaccessible to non-PhD types,"This book was featured in Business Week, where its very interesting premise, namely that there is just enough non-randomness on Wall Street to make money, was laid out. What Business Week fails to do is to inform the reader that, except for an interesting introduction, the essays are pure mathematics with no explanatory text for any but the cognoscenti. Lay readers beware!"
2,hardly read it,"I picked up this book to try to get some background on arguments for and against random walk. Maybe this book has that. I don't know. I have a B.S. in Math and I don't want to go back to school for two years to understand this book.The book is a bunch of math, that's it. If you're looking for a higher level, ""semi-technical"" discussion this isn't it.If you want to sit down with a nice cup of tea and enjoy some graduate level statistics, then go ahead and get it."
2,No for newbies,"I bought this book because it provider a counterpoint to Random walk down wall street. This book is full of mathematical models and stats. Dont buy this if u just want a general investment book. Go with ""A random walk down walk street"""
2,Almost no help for practical trading.,"None of the authors has wall street experiences, and almost all the references of the book were 10 years old, if not older. The claimed weekly non-random walk is based on the very old market data when stocks were almost the only security available. With the advance of internet and global markets, as well as the other (derivative) securites, the stock market is no more a single focal point. I suspect even the claimed is true, the cycle is much shorter now due to the maximum entropy can be reached within much shorter time in today's information era."
3,pretty enough but undistinguished,"This CD ocasionally suffers from the mixing of genres, giving it an unfavorable elevator-music ambience. Apart from that, the CD has lovely moments like ""Seduction"" and ""Compassion"". It's a shame they had to go and name it ""Love Moods"" (perhaps cashing in on the success of ""Pure Moods""), because the name sounds so corny and bland, and the CD often (though not always) surpasses that. Maybe on their next release there will be a little more Chris White vocals, piano and cello and less synth Enya+Yanni+Kenny G frappe."
4,Entertaining yet a bit TOO over-the-top!!!,"""Black Satin"" was, for the most part pretty good. I did not, however, like the petty attitudes of some of the men, and the explicit description of Carla and Ronnie having sex. That part was geared more towards a male's perspective. All-in-all it was a decent read, I just wish I hadn't paid so much for it."
4,ONCE ON THIS ISLAND RULES,"I'm not usually one to buy a CD for just one track...but in this case, I have to admit, that's precisely what I did. Anyone who has seen the musical, ONCE ON THIS ISLAND or had a chance to listen to its soundtrack will be won over. The idea that there were songs cut from this marvelous, ""every song is a winner"" album, was just impossible for me to resist. And WHEN DANIEL MARRIES in this CD does not disappoint. La Chanze's voice is absolutely marvelous. And the bonus? The other tracks are pleasing and fun for any Broadway buff: Liz Callaway's HONEY from Merrily We Roll Along is musically winning. I also liked the songs cut from GYPSY and FLOWER DRUM SONG. For an impulsive buy, I was completely rewarded. I have also ordered the other CD in the series for the ONCE ON THIS ISLAND song, DOWN FROM THE TREE...which also carries a Liz Callaway song. For musical enthusiasts, this series is a nice collector's item...and something to play on a rainy day."
5,The first in this great series,"This CD is the first in a fine series of four releases consisting of songs cut from well-known musicals. Just about any successful musical has had songs cut from it, not always because the song wasn't good, but because it no longer fit the show as updated, or a character or scene was cut (the booklet explains why each song was removed from its show). The songs are all good, some better than others or course, and the performances are wonderful. My favorites are ""Ten Percent"" (cut from Chicago), ""Come Down from the Tree"" (Once on this Island), ""An English Music Hall"" (Mystery of Edwin Drood), and ""Take it in your Stride"" (Annie Get Your Gun). Bruce Kimmel was smart in using show singers instead of pop singers. I recommend the entire series. This one's a great start and a fine addition to any show music collection."
2,The Gricnch that stole christmas - AWESOME! The other two movies - sheer crap.,Just buy the single dvd - the extras are NOT worth thr money. Need seven extra words to post review!
1,Our Very Own piece of $#%+!,"Poor script, poor acting, poor movie. Another reviewer wrote that this movie was the new ""American Graffiti"", but there are no similarities whatsoever, nada, zilch, zero. Don't waste your time!"
5,Simple but fun toy for my 18-month old,"My 18-month old LOVES this toy. He plays with it primarily outside the bath (because he has so much fun with it on the carpet we keep forgetting to bring it to the tub!) His favorite part of Danny's Diving Adventure is the little springboard platform- he put the divers on the platform and then catapaults them. This is a pretty simple toy, but one of my son's favorites.Also-- Amazon says that this product is not appropriate for children under 3 years due to choking hazard, but we made the decision that we felt comfortable using it with our child."
5,Thank you Danny's Diving Aventure!,My 19 month old who LOVED bath time inexplicably started refusing to take a bath a couple weeks ago. We could not figure it out. There was no accident or trauma but simply got so upset I didn't dare push it. Then Danny's Diving Adventure showed up and we opened him up right before attempting bath time. After a little hesitation curiosity got the better of him and we were soon enjoying a fun bath with lots of smiles and laughs. So hopefully it's not a one off and there will be many more like experiences!
3,A decent bathtub toy,"The boat takes on water very easily and doesn't really stay afloat when my one year old is playing with it. He enjoys putting the small people in his mouth the most. I worried that they may pose a choking hazard but I keep a close eye on him and after a couple months, this has never been an issue."
5,cut sleeve,i was very impressed by this film.it showed a view from another's view.it is a charming independent film.light comedy. some very handsome men in the movie.this is a film that you can view with your friends during a get together.
4,You remind me of a man...,"The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer pairs Cary Grant and Myrna Loy to teach Shirley Temple a lesson. Grant plays a playboy artist who is often caught up in disturbances caused by ladies vying for his affection. Myrna Loy plays the judge presiding over the altercation, and the older sister of Shirley Temple who becomes enamored by Grant.One of my favorite classic movies, it has fun comedy, light hearted air, and a happy ending. Any Labyrinth fans will enjoy Cary Grants ""You remind me of a man..."" sketch with the older judges. A brilliant fun film that reminds us a bit of our youth."
4,classic comedy in every sense,"this is not outdated. it is a zany romp. birthdays at the club, and obstacle course scenes are classic. cary grant at his comedic best."
5,"A Great, Great movie",Cary Grant and Myrna Loy at their best. They have a lot of chemistry together. The scene inside the restaurant is priceless!
3,"Amiable, Slight","A rather uninspired but harmless enough movie that goes around the world and back again to establish its goofy premise. Cary Grant gets many chances to show off his flair for physical comedy, Shirley Temple is no less grating as a young adult than she was as a child, and Myrna Loy (who I watched this for) is in the movie a lot, but never given very much to do.Grant fans will probably enjoy this one, but fans of Loy can find vehicles that better display her talents.Grade: B-"
4,Witty and Fun,"I simply adore this movie. It's pure silliness and you'll want to watch it with a friend so that you can occasionally tell them ""You remind me of a man..."" Pick it up to see a teenage Shirley Temple and to laugh out loud at the wit and ridiculousness of it all. A guaranteed smile. :0) If you like this, you'll want to watch ""I was a Male War Bride"" as well."
5,Great,"This is such a fun Cary Grant, It is one of his best comedies. This movie made me laugh from start to finish."
3,"Funny, 40's Screwball Comedy","The Bachelor & The Bobby Soxer is an amusing, feather-light comedy about a playboy artist (Cary Grant) who to avoid jail is commended by a judge (Myrna Loy) to date her seventeen year old sister (Shirley Temple) who has a major crush on him. The move is made to curb the playboy excesses of Mr. Grant and to help get him out of Ms. Temple's system. Mr. Grant shows off all his comedic skills as he plays up the part by dressing like a teenager, adopts the slang of the day and makes a fool of himself in athletic events. For those use to seeing Ms. Temple as a preteen, will be surprised to see her as almost an adult. Ms. Loy is a bit too icy and stern in her role, but she's such a good actress, you can look past that. The film won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Sidney Sheldon who would go on to create I Dream Of Jeannie and become a best-selling novelist."
3,Incomplete,"Well , I only received the camera with the lens that comes with in in the box. The extra lens (75-300 mm) didn't come on the package. I'm still tryng to get Builder Depot to send me the lens but they said it was an error on the Amazon ad and they offer me a partial return of the money (because I already used it) or a 60% discount on the lens. Why do I have to paid for your error or theirs? Someone did a bad ad, someone charge me and someone accept the order. So please pay them the lens and send it to me. My order number was 16137.Thanks"
1,Who Said It?,"About half of the pages in this book are devoted to theology for kids proselytizing Christianity. The other half tries to show how history and science are compressed into Genesis. Overall the book is badly written, and tries to convince the reader that old Earth creationism has been proven compatible with science. Don't waste your money."
4,Riveting and Eye Opening,"For those born after WW2, it is hard to imagine this happening. The story of this boy's struggle and his parents' sacrifice to allow him to return to this country is a lesson of how thankful many of us should be. One would only endure and persist so much to return to the greatest country in the world."
3,Can't beat the price,"This DVD delivers what it advertises. You see the last minute of the hunt as the animal is shot and collected. Almost all the hunts are guided and use a rifle.The DVD gets 3 stars for fairly interesting hunting scenes, truth in advertising and bargain price."
4,Necessary part of the set -- unless you only have single joists.,This item needed if using the BoWrench tool and need to push or pull over a double joist or more.
3,More slippy than grippy,"I bought this BoWrench accessory to assist installing deck boards over double joists. It worked fairly well, but I would say it is average in its performance. It slipped a lot on the double joists and I often had to wedge a shim between the tool and the joist to make it work properly. With that being said, this is an essential accessory for your BoWrench if you have to work with anything larger than 2"" joists. I just wish the design was better."
5,Blood Monkey,"This is a good movie that I saw.It has gore,creature violence,action,terror.But the ending isok but I wish that some characterssurvived.So do more good reviewsfor this movie ok."
3,SCHLOCK THE MONKEY...,"BLOOD MONKEY stars renowned, Oscar-winning actor, F. Murray Abraham as a scientist who lures a group of college students into the deep jungle in search of the elusive title creatures. Abraham chews, swallows, and digests the scenery, while leading the young, beautiful people closer to their doom. MONKEY is a fairly dull, predictable affair, w/ little blood, and even less monkey. When we finally get a glimpse of the beasts (at the very end!), they are pretty disappointing. Still, it was worth it just to witness the tent-drenching urination sequence..."
3,I don't think it was that bad.,"No it wasn't as good as maneater, but I don't think it was that bad. Iactually enjoyed it. Trust me, there are worst movies out there."
1,MONKEY SEE MONKEY DOODOO,"Some observations on this celluloid disaster:*Is six the new number of potential victims in horror movies (e.g., IN THE SPIDER'S WEB)*Why do the so-called friends always seem to bicker among themselves?*Where's the monkey? We get a couple minor glimpses of it, but only one full shot for about three seconds. We need more of the monster, writers! (NO WONDER THEY'VE GONE ON STRIKE; SOME WRITERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED BACK)*Let's ease up on the digital cameras folks. Too many movies use them and they're as annoying as the actor handling it.*Why do the six heroes never question the professor about the bloodied man who shows up and then dies?*And finally, why would an actor who won an Oscar for AMADEUS show up in a film like this and act so horribly? Surely he didn't need the money? Hmmm..."
1,The INVINSIBLE monkey,I will not make any other comments about how auful this movie was but i only will ask this. Anybody seen the...MONKEY ?Did u see the monkey ?Did u mam ?Did u thomas ?And u...PETER ?Errr...Where the F13 hell was the monkey ?PS.I think i will go buy a pair of...glasses. I'm getting old and i'm starting not seeing INVINSIBLE BLOOD S$IT MONKEYS...AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
1,2 Different Boots,"I had to return these boots. The soles were totally different in appearance and texture. I don't know if I just got a lemon or if quality control is a serious issue. I've owned several pairs of these boots over the years. The used to wear like iron and were as comfortable as a pair of your favorite slippers, but my last couple of pairs have fallen apart. It seems to me that the ""Wolverine"" name is becoming synonomous with ""Garbage""."
5,AWESOME,"I'm gluten intolerant, lactose intolerant, and have many sensitive food allergies and can't find these at any supermarket. So I'm very excited to be able to order these on Amazon. I love Cherrybrook because it tastes great and allows me to eat baked goods that I normally can't."
1,ugh,"I'm convinced the reviews before me are written by friends of the author. I can't even finish it. Lame lame lame. Sorry! Not the ""amazing journey through time""."
2,Better look elseware...,"Ok, when I saw this, i was thinking that it would solve my problem with a faulty mouse and a dead keyboard. oh god was i wrong. it uses IR signals, so you cant even type with your knees up! for $75 you would expect at least some RF. go away from this product, leave your money in some other companys claws."
2,Wireless Keyboard has a sticky mouse,"For the amount of money I paid, I believe the Taiwanese could have supplied a mouse that doesn't constantly get stuck. It's frustrating and annoying to rub the wheel back and forth until I finally manage to fit the cursor into the little square.Furthermore the receiver doesn't always receive. The range is not what they say, it is much less and it is not reliable, you can be typing away and it all gets lost no matter how precisely you point the lights."
2,Poor IR range.,"Will not work unless you point it right at the receiver. You can't sit on the couch and keep it in your lap because it will be pointing above the TV and the receiver won't pick up the signal. Solution would be to put the IR receiver above the TV. It shouldn't be that sensitive though.Also, if the IR beam is broken while typing, the receiver will get stuck on a key and keep pressing it until another key is pressed and connection is re-established.Very poor design. Gets a 2 instead of a 1 because if you point it right at the receiver, it does actually work quite well. It also seems fairly ruggedly built. However, since this is supposed to be used in your lap, it cannot be used as intended and only gets 2 stars."
2,Poor axe for fire service,"As a professional firefighter I do not recommend this axe for use in the fire service.It is too small to generate much striking force. It is very sharp, so it will cut, but it will take a while to cut thru anything. Also, I found the pick end too sharp to be safe. If you are looking for a small personal fire axe and don't want a standard 5 or 6 pound axe, look at the ""Estwing E45A campers axe."""
5,Another Exciting Ludlum Book!,"Ludlum has used a unique plot and a very original approach to writing this book. Both of the powers in World War II are in need of a product to have a sucessful war effort. The Nazis are in need of industrial diamond to finish Peenemunde and the Allies need a gyro guidance system in order to effectively bomb the Germans. The two sides are finally brought together and a deal is made. The two parties will meet in Argentina. David Spaulding an excellent agent in Spain is sent to Argentina by his government. He doesn't know the real purpose of the illegal transaction. The Nazis are going to trade the gyro system foe the industrial diamonds. In the meantime the Haganah(an underground Jewish group) brings Spaulding the real nature of the transaction. Spaulding is finally able to crash the deal. The Nazis lose thanks to Spaulding, with the help of the Haganah. This is a very good book that is definitely a page turner.Buy it,you will not be dissapointed."
5,Fast service....happy customer,I read this novel years ago and just had to read it again. Great action and I love the way Ludlam (at least in the early stuff) weaves fiction around fact. Great Book even the second time around.Paulos
4,"Great knife, needs better wire cutters.","Everything about this knife is better than my leatherman super tool, except the shorter needle nose, and the wire cutters on the needle nose are half the length."
4,favorite belt tool,"I bought this for my wife. We now live on a cruising sail boat. I've had mine for over 10 years. In daily use for the last 5 years as a sailor/boatbuilder. I like the fact that the blades and tools are on the outside and don't require opening the tool to get at them. I also like the phillips blade, which is more substantial than one often finds on such tools. I ground off the serrations on the serrated blade to make a second regular blade. It is has decent heft but is still wearable."
1,Swiss Multi-Tool a dud,"This tool is very well made, no doubt. It is poorly engineered. I have both the Leatherman Wave and this Swiss Tool. As a farmer, the most used tool is the cutting blade. To get it out I have to have strong fingernails of the right length and use two bare hands. This is totally an annoyance, to drop what one is doing and get bare handed to operate the most used blade is not well thought out. Using the Wave, I can open the most used blades with gloved, one hand operation. It seems like a small thing but in everyday use, the Wave wins hands down. The Swiss Tool engineers should field test their product in real world use. I now use it for a letter opener."
2,Break a fingernail,Good luck getting the knife to unfold from the handle without breaking your thumbnail. You'd think that the one tool that you will use the most would be easy to extract. Nope. You have to a pull other tools out just so that can get the leverage to pull the knife out. It's simply in there too tightly.
4,It Polishes,"You screw it into the Dremel stem and then it goes round and round, polishing what it touches unless it is soft rubber, then it can burn that. Ooops Learn by my mistakes."
3,Horribly overpriced,I could not believe my eyes when i saw the price of this little felt thingy. Are they serious? Over 4 dollars for a peace of felt in a shape of a bullet. Insanity.
4,7 Years later and it's still kicking!,"I bought this seven years ago and it's still working great, and looks very stylish! 7 years later and I'm still happy with this buy!"
2,Not as good as other WOW vehicles,"I have bought several of the other WOW vehicles for my 2 year old son. This just isn't as impressive to him as the others. The little yellow walls on the back of the trailer constantly fall off, the magnetic hitching mechanism doesn't stay together, and the animals don't stay in the back of the trailer either. This is all very frustrating to a 2 year old. The only thing he enjoys about it is saying ""Bumpety Bump Bernie"", which sounds very cute coming from a toddler! Hopefully it is a toy he will grow into as he gets older. I would recommend the fire engine or garbage truck first over this toy."
5,nephew seemed to like it,"This was 1 of SEVERAL toy vehicles my youngest nephew got for Christmas. Despite the competition, this one is pretty cute. I loved the sound and motion of the wheels. I also appreciate that there are 7 pieces in the set. My only gripes are the fence parts seem to come off easily and the price. I paid just over $25.00 for it. But it is a good toy and holds up well against the competition. Certainly recommend to others!"
5,I happened to enjoy it.,"I for one liked this Spider-Man series. While I can see it might not be everyone's taste, I found it to be fun and action oriented and hope it gets a chance at a second season to develop further.I love how the animation looks like a 3-dimensional comic book. Other's may complain that CGI should look like the Final Fantasy movie. Sure it may look real standing still but I found the performances almost creepy in how zombie-like the movement is. CGI just doesn't look real to me.MTV's Spider-Man still has the look of a cartoon so movement issues can be forgiven. Unlike traditional cell animation, this series was able to render action scences from all angles allowing the ""camera"" to move through out the scene to great effect.The voice cast is all perfect for their roles. Neil and Lisa work really well together.And as always, don't judge a show based on internet rumors. More often than not they turn out to be completly false, just smear tactics used by angry ""fanboys""."
3,Not appropiate for small children,I expected the violence not the profanity or all the sexy stuff. This cartoon is geared towards adults and there is no real warning or rating stating that for those purchasing online (like myself). My husband says the story lines are pretty good though and he likes it so I gave it 3 stars for that reason alone.
3,Too mature for young children!!!,I should have researched this better but not even sure I would have found out the poor language choices in this so called cartoon I would not allow kids under ten to watch!!!
5,Congratulations!,"Let me only say this-this show is a wonder to watch.I am over forty years old but to see Spider-Man with such movements and bodylanguage and the fantastic filmed fight scenes gives me goosebumps.There are so much worse animated shows(all the other Spidey Shows are for an adult viewer horrible),that it is great to see what CGI can do on Dynamics.With Batman and Roughnecks this will stand on his own for decades.Go on make more seasons,there is so much animated trash out there,it is time we get something that is worth to watch!"
2,A Great Disappointment,"So just how much involvement did Brian Michael Bendis have in this less than stellar effort? Could not have been much. I read a lot of his stuff (Powers, Ultimate Spider-Man, Daredevil, etc.) and the man is a freakin' genius. This show is NOT genius. Some good action sequences, but that's about it. The characters are SOOOOO flat.This had so much potential, and it all deflated. It just never gelled. There was nothing cohesive about it. How much money did they spend, and for what? A few hours of a video game that I don't even get to control.Really, that's it. Watching this show is like watching someone ELSE play a video game, itching for your chance to grab the controls . . . but you never get the controls.Well, Spider-Man 2 is hitting theaters in a few months and THAT will ROCK!!"
1,"Cool DVD, cruddy Spidey series.","I'm sure the DVD will be great, being the full first season instead of a 'best of' compilation, but I dont really dig the way they used the textures with the 3d animation. It looks too X-Box-ish. Hahah. I'll wait for the DVD box set of the original Spiderman series from the 1960's that Ralph Bakshi worked on."
1,Spider-Man,My son is 4 years old. This DVD too advanced for him. He only watched a small portion once before changing to a different movie. He does like spiderman but this wasn't the mvoie for him.
1,This spider SUCKS!!!,"This newest version of the Spider Man animated series is terrible. The animation is poorly done, and obviously much cheaper to produce, than traditional cartooning. It would be half forgivable if the dialog wasn't so terrible. Marvel has to stop trying to cut corners with it's hot properties, this newest series will fade away, just like the last one, remember that future/off-world Spiderman cartoon? This ""hip"" new version won't snag a new audience, there's too much superior competition. The current X-men cartoon series sets the standard, followed closely by DC's Justice League. The new Spiderman cartoon is a lame attempt to cash in on the Tobey Maguire movie's success, well if owner Avi Arad (sounds like a third rate villian) wants to cash in yet again - he'll need to dig a little deeper into his fat pockets. When this series dies, perhaps Marvel will listen to the fans who kept the wall crawler alive and create a true cartoon instead of this animatronic drivel, here's hoping!"
3,Spiderman DVD,"My toddler likes this, but the language & humor is really more for a teenager to adult."
4,Great for adults but not for young kids so beware,"This updated look for Spiderman is really impressive. The storylines are good and the spiderman action sequences is really impressive. Unfortunately, with a few modest changes I could of recomended this for everyone. I think it kinda has a PG TO PG 13 rating due to some mild sexual content and a few curse words MTV deciding to throw in . If the relationships stayed allittle more modest and the eliminated the very few curs words that existed this would be great fun for everyone. As an adult its perfectly fine and a great series but I know how much i loved spiderman as a kid with the old cartoons which this is really more action packed. However, the minor flaws cant be ignored for younger kids. Its a solid 4 stars and thats simply because this should of been fun for the entire family and with a few minor changes it would of been . I loved it and wanted more after viewing. Teen and above i would show but not younger kids ."
1,Not for children,"I bought this ""cartoon"" for my 5 year old grandson. It has bad language, but no warning on the label. It is not appropriate for kids. Examples: ""Let's get the hell out of here"" ""kill her"" ""she has a nice bod"""
1,Spider-Man - The New Animated Series (Special Edition) by Neil Patrick Harris,Not for young children!! I bought this DVD for my son for Christmas and was horrified that it contained inappropriate language and extreme violence.
1,This Is OKAY!,This new Spider-Man show on MTV is bad!To 3-D!It looks like a video game it is a bad movie I hate it!
5,Writing and directing make it shine,"As someone who doesn't have cable tv, the first time I saw this show was on a screen at a Sony store. I bought the DVD based on the unusual look of the show and I was blown away. Thank god someone is producing cartoons with gutsy writing, outstanding acting direction and a great stylized look. I thought that great cartoons had died with Batman - The Animated Series. Watching lame cartoons (like the mid 90's rehash of Spiderman that came along with the incredibly dull X-Men cartoon)makes you wonder why the creative 'geniuses' can't come up with something great. I guess, having watched the informative featurettes included in this DVD set, the difference is money. A lot of money has gone into this CGI SpiderMan and it's apparently all been well used. I'm really hoping that I get to buy a second season DVD set next year."
1,NOT FOR KIDS!!!,"We purchased this DVD for our 11 year old son. The Amazon description says that it is not rated, but the DVD itself says it is rated PG. I wish we had known this AND I wish we had read the reviews first.From the title I thought it was the old Spiderman cartoons ""re-made"", but this series is full of scantily-clad girls, inappropriate language, and mature story-lines. The show looks more like a video game than a cartoon.Our son enjoyed the chase/fight scenes, but he won't be watching any more of these and we'll be on the look-out for older Spiderman cartoons on DVD to replace these."
2,Spider-Man The New Animated Series: Season One,MTV tryed to be edgey. but most the time it doesn't work. For die hard spider-man fans only
3,Not all it could have been,"First off, I'm a huge spider-man fan. I heard about this upcoming mtv series very early on and was in front of my tv for the premiere, and for the following few weeks. What I found when I tuned in was a beautifully animated show, with some nice ideas and characters, that ultimately fell short because of its scripts. The major problem with Spider-man the tv show was that it was a half hour in length. This gave the writers zero time to get you to the villian, have them fight spider-man, and then come to a resolution. Because of this alot of the episodes felt rushed, and alot of the endings were over the top. It's hard to end an episode in 5 min without making it seem like a really cheesy way to defeat a super villian. Maybe if it was an hour long like the much acclaimed smallville, it would have had a chance to flesh out its stories. But as it is the series fell short of expectations, and fell off of my tv radar."
2,Not really for young children,"I bought this for my 3 year old who loves spiderman, but it's alot more mature than what I want him watching."
5,Bendis can really weave a web.,"I just recently purchased the DVD set and am anxiously awaiting the fate of this television series. I didn't get into it when it was first coming out on television because I am not the hugest fan of the MTV programming of recent years and feared what might happen because of the way most of its programming has been like. I caught only a few episodes when it was on just out of curiousity and discovered it was really good, the stories, the voice work, the new characters, and even the animation. The only problem with the DVD is that you NEED to know what happens next and I truly hope that someone will pick up this television and give Bendis more opportunities to see what he can really do."
3,another stupid review,I ordered this for the grand kids I thought it was ok not a fan of any spider man or bug
4,John J.,"Great season, lots of surprises, different from other seasons. Characters were 3-D and lots of fun. Well performing old and new villains. Love that Spidey!!!"
4,Good for any true believer,"While many people who have seen this series complain because they don't like the ""Cell Animation"" or the story line....ignore them. I own over 400 spider-man comics, have seen every cartoon and real series in completion at least once and im telling you this series was well done. Some scenes were alittle strong for a spider-man cartoon and they did play the technological aspect alittle too much, but, you have to plaese everybody, not just the spider-man fanatics. The one-liners were great(classic spider-man trait) and the action, his movements, were very well done. If you haven't seen it you should...especially the last two episodes...amazing!"
5,Lets Move To Cleveland's best outing!,"This is a great cd. I think FZ put it together so tight in an effort to make some good light come out of the 84 band ensemble. This particular lineup did not have the best sound, and it shows on a lot of the live recordings from the era... and considering it followed the classic lineup of 82-83, it was falling into some tough competition. But frank found some wonderful performances to bolster this great lineup. Well worth your time, and frank guitar playing is totally powerful, if not totally brilliant.There is a DVD release of this concert, but songs are missing. Still, even though it is released by EMI and has been edited as not to offend someone (C@cksuckers B@ll removed)it is still worth purchasing because the music is fun to watch and listen to.Give it a try."
5,Sensational,"I have just about every album the great man recorded. This album offers an excellent cross-section of songs, with some scorching guitar solos, wonderful instrumental passages, the usual humour in the lyrics and the usual absolute attention to the minutest detail in terms of the delivery of the whole FZ package. it sounds like it was recorded yesterday, not some 25 years ago. Buy it."
2,"Better than Dremel original cutoff wheels, but still bad","The people reviewing these wheels with 5 stars must be taking great care of them as one only lasts me about 20 minutes. Admittedly, mine is field use and there's a high likelihood the die grinder will get knocked around, in which case the wheel will break quicker than you can blink. Compared to a 5"" cutoff wheel in an angle grinder, this product is junk. Lasting 20 minutes instead of 2 is an improvement, but not by much."
3,They are ok. good price.,"I didn't realize this when I bought them, but they are a 1/4 inch smaller diameter than the normal cut off wheels that came with my set. They lasted about the same length as the metal 1 1/2"" wheels did except they were harder to use in my situation because they were shorter and didn't have that extra reach the metal ones did. I went through about 2 1/4 wheels cutting a approx 5x8 hole in my truck for modified speakers. The normal 1 1/2"" metal ones took about 1 and 3/4 wheels.So to me they performed roughly the same except less reach initially and I swear the SPARK a heck of a lot more than the others! Can't complain about the price though."
5,These cut through steel without any problems,"I used the Dremel 426 Cut-Off Wheel to cut through a steel pipe, and it made the cut successfully. I set the rotary tool to the highest speed. Just keep the tool in the right position and let the cut-off wheel's speed and abrasive make the cut. I then tried to use this wheel to cut a 3/8 inch wide notch going half way through the pipe. Once again, the wheel allowed me to make the cut and then widen the cut into a notch. This wheel shows no signs of wear or damage so far, after a few uses. I highly recommend this product for cutting through metal."
1,What?,"The story started out fine. And then the plot fell off the face of the earth. Not very satisfying. I finished the movie thinking, ""What a waste of my time."""
5,"Emil told it like it is, baby","My favorite quote from THE NEW GODS: ""It is difficult, it is impossible to believe that the Good Lord--'Our Father'--had a hand in the scandal of creation. Everything suggests that He took no part in it, that it proceeds from a god without scruples, a feculent god. Goodness does not create, lacking imagination; it takes imagination to put together a world, however botched. At the very least, there must be a mixture of good and evil in order to produce an action or a work. Or a universe. Considering ours, it is altogether easier to trace matters back to a suspect god than to an honorable one.""This is a reaction that's generally referred to as gnosticism or Manicheanism. And I can dig it."
3,Good Intentions,"It could be a lovely book if the image quality were much improved. I was disappointed with it, yet commend the author for his good intentions."
4,GREAT FOR THOSE NOW BEGINNING IN SANTERA(ORISHA WORSHIP),JUST GOT THIS BOOK AND SO FAR IT IS A WEALTH OF IMFORMATION DEALING WITH SANTERIA OR ORISHA WORSHIP ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH EGGUN WORSHIP.AS A ORISHA PRIEST I AM PLEASE AS THEY ARE MANY BOOKS OUT THERE BUT A LOT OF THEM HAVE VERY LITTLE IMFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT THIS BOOK IS WELL WRITTEN AND HATS OFF TO THE AUTHOR.MAY OBATALA BLESS HIM...
5,Excellent for research.,Excellent reference in English to understand the concepts of the ancient African religion.Book will take you around the yoruba world in simple way and will explain in plain words some of their ceremonies.
1,Look for a third party substitute,Each of these wore out before sharpening one chain. I found diamond replacements for half the price and they last twice as long.
4,Wonderful treat,"This product arrived in a timely manner, very well packed and was given as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. The recipient raved about it. Thank you."
3,Interesting,"George Clark is a genius who happens to be in the eight grade.Because of his intellect he is constantly being attacked by a group of boys at school called the ""the bruise brothers"". Because his father is the principal the boys always get into trouble for bothering him. George is the narrator of this book and he begins the story of the eight grade science trip in where his father is not going along and how the ""Bruise brothers are finally going to get him. In the book George goes back and forth with whether the ""Bruise brothers were actually going to get him, for awhile they even befriended only to find out it was a set up. I felt the author went on to long about the fate of the main character and his nemeisis. Overall it was an okay read could have drawn its conclusion sooner."
1,not really worth it,I purchased this tool hoping it would help things move faster .After 10 minuets we put it back in the box .I will return it Does not work well Mario from Yonkers
3,Tool not like the picture,"I just received the BW-2 BoWrench tool. and have used it on one decking board. It seems to work ok, but the tool received is not at all like the tool advertised in the picture. Time will tell if it will be as useful as I was expecting."
4,nice but not quite what i expected,"this product works fairly well,however, it is not quite what i expected. maybe that is because is the wood is bowed it will set up when pulled tight and you need someone with some fairly good weight to hold it down by stepping on it. the ""legs"" also tend to slip at times. maybe that is due to my sealing the wood so the legs where extra slippery. otherwise it seems to work well, knowing what i know now i would still buy it to help with the deck boards it is still very useful."
4,WOULD NOT DO A DECK WITH OUT IT,HAVE DONE A HAFE DOZEN DECKS AND USED THIS TOOL EACH TIME IT WORKS GREAT. THE GUYS I WORK WITH SAID THEY WOULD BUY ONE (IF I DID NOT HAVE IT) SO THEY BORROW MINE.
3,Beware if you are using joist flashing.,"My deck is 5/4 x 6 Ipe on treated joists. I capped the joists with Grace Vycor flashing (flexible stick-on rubber flashing) for rot protection. I found the Bo Wrench slips on the flashing, partly because the grip pins are smooth, making it difficult to use. Removing the flashing would, of course, leave the joists unprotected. So beware if you are using flexible joist flashing. If the manufacturer added some roughness on the surface of the gripping pins or perhaps a hard-rubber ring near the bottom of the pins, it might alleviate this problem.Also, the orange paint on the tool left faint orange streaks on the sides of the Ipe deck boards, and the wire clips for the retaining pins pop off much too easily.Still, I found it to be a valuable tool."
4,Stop picking your wood,"This is a super time saver. No more working the woodpile, especially the pressure treated decking that some of the mega Home fixer upper Department stores sell. This will straighten most bends."
4,Great Helper,"The BoWrench did the job that I was hoping for. It made the job run smoothly and avoided having to strain. My only compliant is you can end up paying twice as much for the accessories that for the most part I am sure you wont need(I least I didn't). I built a large deck, approx. 600 sq. ft."
5,A must have for deck building,Simply a must have for doing a deck. Yes you can do without it but the time and energy spent with other means is not worth it! Built rougged and will do many decks with ease! Well worth the money!
4,"missing parts, but a helpful tool","really helps straighten boards, but the instuctions were faded and not easy to read. plus missing the cotter- like pins that hold the pieces together, had to go to hardware store."
5,We'd Be Lost Without It,This is the greatest tool! My husband and I are paneling our guest bedroom in our log home and it has been a godsend. We could never have done as good a job without it. We would recommend it to anyone.
3,Parts Missing,"I ordered this item, it shipped in a timely manner. I opened it up ready to get to work on a Saturday morning on my deck, opened it up, and all of the pins that hold it together were not in the box. I had to use a prybar instead. I bet it works great when I get the pins to put it together."
4,Tigerwood-IPE decking,Great product. I just finished my deck of 500square ft of brizilian hardwood all on a 45' angle. Tool can take a beating without ever failing. Easy to use. Compared to the old way of using a large flat screw driver to pry over boards this tool will free up your hands with extreme holding power and never nicks or scars decking. You will not have to replace this tool and can reuse again and again.
3,cepo tool decking rench,slips a little but works good .saves needing a helper all the time being the lumber you buy now isnt the best
4,BO-Wrench decking tool,"I can't imagine having put a deck together without the bowrench. It paid for itself in the first hour of the project, laying an IPE deck. The only complaint I have is that the plastic ends popped off after a few hours. But by-in-large those ends are not needed for functionality."
5,Great tool,Perfect tool for straightening bowed deck boards. Without this tool there really is no good way on to straighten a board. I highly recommend.
1,Concept gets a 10....performance gets 0,"Faced with replacing a 25 year old, 1500 s/f deck, the BoWrench looked liked it would be a great help; after all, leverage is one of man's best friends. However, it was a big disappointment. It lacks an adequate grip on the joists, and tends to slip back along the joist, just when you are at a critical point. They need to redesign the gripper jaws to really grip the joist. I'd recommend some type of cam-like action. To keep it from slipping I found that I had to drive a screwdriver or a couple of nails behind it into the joist. The same problem occurs with the ""Adjustable"" attachment for wider joists. All-in-all I would not recommend wasting your money. A crow-bar or heavy screwdriver driven into the joist works just as well and is easy to use. Anybody want to buy a hardly used BoWrench...cheap?"
1,Screen Lasted for 2 1/2 Months.,The unit's speakers are very poor however once you hook up a pair of computer speakers it sounds great. The quality of the screen is average. You generally need to be looking directly at in order to see it clearly. After 2 months the screen went. It would remain on for a few seconds and the shut off. If you turned it on and off numerous times it might last for 5 - 10 minutes before going out again. It is now being sent to Audiovox for repairs. If you look at other reviews it seems to be a defect w/ the unit. Not worth your money.
1,died in 4months,"LCD lasted 4 months. When it worked it was great but reliability is zero. Thank god for extended warranty from Circuit City, back it goes tomorrow for repair"
1,STAY AWAY!!!,"We bought one, opened the box and it was broken. We exchanged it for another-attempted to screw it under the cabinet and had trouble because the screws supplied didn't fit through the spacers supplied-and when it was finally in place, the DVD player didn't work and the instruction booklet is written very poorly! We exchanged it again, hooked it up (again with screw/spacer problems)and then realized that the magnet meant to hold the screen up out of the way couldn't hold the weight of the screen!!!! We finally gave up-NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!"
1,Screen died after 10 months,LCD started dying about 6 months (strange vertical areas of VERY shallow contrast) after purchase and was totally gone after about 10 months.I noticed a review from someone who returned the unit to Audiovox. Could you forward along the return information in another review? Thanks!
1,Absolutely horrible,"this thing broke within 5 days of use, the speaker broke. but before that even happened the sound was horrible to begin with, not to mention the very annoying speaker phone system that wouldn't work for anything. all i can say is thank god for that warranty."
5,Very Pleased,"I read the reviews from other people. The guy who didn't like the speakers, must like it very loud. The volumne and quality is very good. For a normal size kitchen, its loud enough. The picture is very clear. We connected it to our cable and its a beautiful picture. My only complaint is because its a flat screen, you must view from straight on. But this is true of all flat screens. The man who said you have very little room to connect is right on. So, we connected all wires first, then hung it up under the cabinet,This worked out well.I would recommend this product to anyone who will use it often, as the price is a bit high."
4,Nice Product,"This is a very nice product, combining a dvd/cd/mp3 player with flat screen tv and radio functions. Most of these undercounter units are much smaller and don't include the player function. The 10.4 inch display is really about as small as you want to go for decent visibility if you're working in the kitchen.Only real minus is that you should be fairly handy to mount the unit. Four screws have to go straight up through the unit for mounting. There's a template, but this really is a two person job, and all the connections must be made before mounting."
1,Disappointed,We purchased the Audiovox under the cabinet TV/DVD unit. The volume button on the remote control did not work. We returned it for another. The second one did not work either. The DVD player on the unit did not work. We returned the unit to the store where we purchased it for our money back. Don't waste your money on this item.
4,SKIL73114 Octo Sandpaper kit.,Received as advertised with several different grits. Made sanding the deck a whole lot easier......just wish the grit stayed intact longer. Needed to change often.....but still a lot easier than doing it by hand. Would order and use again. :)
4,Pretty good,I bought a cheap sander and this works pretty good. Used it pretty heavily and it held up pretty good. Not bad.
5,There is nothing like this,"This book is probably Grant's most important work, and it is absolutely unique among all the literature on the pro-life/pro-choice debate. No one interested in the pro-life cause has any business being without Grand Illusions, and no one interested in the pro-choice cause has any business not reading this and trying to refute it (they can't, but if they want to claim even the slightest degree of intellectual honesty, they must try).Pro-lifers are unarmed without Grand Illusions: no joke."
4,An Excellent History of One of History's Darkest Subjects,"While Grant focuses primarily on the history of Planned Parenthood and abortion in the modern-era United States, the most useful portion of his book is in the first half, when he traces the historical record of abortion practices over the past two millenia. There is truly nothing new under the sun. If you desire to know more about how abortion came to be both legal and fairly prevalent in the United States, this book is a good place to start."
3,"Better books on the subject exist, but not bad","I found this book very helpful in my research of the legacy of abortion, but I have found more helpful books. This book contained lots of information, but could definately have been presented with out all the flowery words and catchy phrases. I would recomend Intended Consequences by Donald Critchlow"
3,Flawed But Not Bad,"Except for the flowery language, which makes one think the author wishes he were writing a 19th-Century novel, this is an accurate and disturbing book. If you don't mind a bunch of alliteration, nouns modified by half a dozen adjectives, etc., the book should hold your interest whether you agree with the author or not. I agree with the author's stance on abortion; I do not, however, completely agree with his tirade against birth control. Furthermore, I find some of his manufactured dialogue hard to believe."
3,Grand Illusions of scholarship,"This book, complete with impressive numbers of references, provides for compelling reading. As a person with pro-life sentiments, I was initially captivated. However, upon closer examination, I realized I was reading nothing more than an elaborate ad hominem of Margaret Sanger. In addition, the book overgeneralizes its ""revelations"" to paint present day Planned Parenthood with a black brush.This book is may be pro-life, but it is unfortunately not pro-truth. It is progaganda."
1,Hateful,"Why are the reviews supporting this book so hateful??? I assumed they were Christians, but Christians would not be so intolerant and smallminded. Could they be worshipping the Devil, ya think??"
5,Popular UK Jump Blues Bands 1st Outing Supurb!!!,"The Debut CD From UKs Number One Jump Blues And R&B Band... Featuring The Great Mike Sanchez On Piano And Vocals.. Great Selection of Rockin Songs From The Late 40s Early 50s Also Some Great Sanchez Originals... Great Rockin Sax Also... If You Like To Dance, One Play Of This CD Should Get You Movin... So If You Like Good Rockin Jump Blues And R&B Dont Miss Out On This Great CD... Highly Reccomended!!!!!!!!"
4,Another quality Zappaphonic release!,"While not my favorite of the YCDTOSA releases, it's another great collection of Zappa's music. The only thing I don't like about this is that it concentrates pretty heavily on the '84 band, one of my least favorite of Zappa's groups. But, if you're a hardcore zappa fan, or just getting into him, this is a great collection."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I got this to use on my Canon Rebel XT. The first time I used it it ended up putting hundreds of dust and/or rubber particles on my sensor. So I ended up using the photographic solutions sensor swabs along with eclipse fluid cleaning system instead which is a solution along with a sterile pad. This worked much better, but I still have a lot of dust in there from the blower, it even got up into the eyepiece which is kind of annoying, but doesn't hurt picture quality. I recently bought Giottos Rocket-Air and tried that out, it worked great. I took my other one to work to use as a keyboard blower, that's about all the more I would trust with it. You have been warned."
4,"I thought it would be about Vietnam, am I dumb!",Does a writer who shares the same name as a famous guy who writes about his years in 'Nam sell as many books?? That's one question I think I know the answer to!
3,"Cheap 36 in TV, get what you pay for","If you want a fairly large TV for an affordable price this is it. Forget about watching the beautiful HDTV channels or progressive scan DVDs this is not a digital TV. The sound and picture are ok. The menu is sparse because there are not too many bells and whistles on this TV. It has 3 types of inputs which I am using all 3. I have the cable box connected via S-Video. I have the DVD connected via component (Pr Pb Y) and the VCR connected via regular cable. You can also use composite cable (red white yellow)instead of S-Video. The S-video and composite share analog audio inputs (red white) and the component has its own analog audio inputs. There is also an analog audio output on the back of the TV. The front has composite inputs as well, I dont know which one of the three share it. I payed $700 for this TV at Sears on February 2003."
4,Quirky & Fun,"Unlike the reviews above mine, I haven't seen the man live, but I do enjoy this cd quite a bit. His tongue is thoroughly in his cheek as he delivers music that's part lounge, part They Might Be Giants, and part...oh, I dunno......""X-Files"" maybe?"
5,short review,This is the best handsaw I have ever used. Period. I am a carpenter with 18 years in the business. This thing is sure to please.
4,A fine tool for cutting SOFT materials,"The replacement blades are ridiculously expensive, especially relative to the price of the saw, but this is a fine tool. great for all types of cutting in wood or plastic. I have found it most useful for shim and trim purposes.Everyone should have one of these in their toolbag."
1,blade won't stay fixed,The blade pops out or comes loose often. Constantly tightening it. Cheap-o. It is very flexible so you have to cut very attentively to ensure that the cut stays straight.
4,Handy,"I have an arsenal of power tools, but when I need to make a few cuts, this does the trick. I have another Japanese saw with a support rib at the top, but the rib prevents using it in a miter box. That is where the 10-2440 shines. If you use it to cut miters, I recommend clamping your workpiece, or putting adhesive-backed sandpaper on the miter box fence, because pulling on the saw can make the workpiece creep."
1,Ridiculous price for buffing compound.,"Anyone with a set of Dremel bits probably got a little tiny cup of this stuff with it. It's good that they include it in buffing sets, but as a separate refill these are insane. When I ran out of the included cup about 15 years ago, I went to my nearest home improvement store and got a tube of it which was about 6 times larger for the same price. I still have it."
3,I would considere this product to be of average quality.,This polishing compound came with my flexshaft. I would like it better if it were in a wider container. I have bought the smallest polishing wheels that I can find and it will only fit part of the way into the container. Maybe if it were in a little wider container it wouldn't be such a problem.
5,Excellent! One of Zappa's absolute best albums,"Along with the Boulez and Nagano (LSO) recordings, this excellent album stands out as Zappa's best work from the first half of the eighties (a bland period). The satire-pop songs (""We're turning again"" and ""Yo cats"")are funny and delightful and the works for synclavier are among Zappa's best compositions ever (along with ""Inca Roads, ""Peaches"", etc.). Too bad that so many people immediately reject them because of their synthetic sound and their ""coldness"". ""One man, One vote"", ""Little Beige Sambo"" , ""Aerobics In Bondage"" are all exquisite, so are ""Alien Orifice"", and ""What's New In Baltimore"" which both include marvellous guitar-playing. Listen to this album a few times, and see that my five star-rating is deserved (By the way: Why can't people shade off their ratings? A lot of five star-ratings include bunches of disclaimers telling of mediocrity)."
3,Good and a half,"This is Zappa's docualbum of his tift with the PMRC, who held congressional hearings on putting smut labels on albums in 1985.All the rock track ""We're Turning Again,"" ""Yo' Cat's""are digitally recorded, and were some of the first to show Zappa's love affair with modern technology. The playing and writing is great, and the production sounds cutting edge today. The songs are fine but not standouts.""Porn Wars"" is a montage of the hearings--with Zappa in attack mode--and he samples digital monster sounds to show his contempt for the PMRC fun and games.Just for this track, the album is a big piece in the late-Zappa puzzle.Funny story: this was one of the first of Zappa's albums I got. I was so ignorant to Zappa at the time, when I saw the word Mothers on the cover, I looked on the back credits, thinking Zappa had rehired Ian Underwood and Motorhead and Jimmy Carl Black."
3,synthetic,"I DO have trouble with the Synclavier works (I like rock band versions of these tracks, like Baltimore, Turning again and Orifice a lot better). But it cannot be denied: the compositions are very good.Porn wars is a bit of a period piece, and relevant to the US (Tipper Gore!) only, but interesting nonetheless."
1,Laughable,"This album sounds like a sing song down the local Alcoholics Anonymous group. The first track sounds so bad its laughable. Why is Ozzy releasing such dia crap these days? From the Prince of Darkness we now have the Prince of nothingness. I think the money and fame have just got to their heads now, and hopefully the public will become bored of this ridiculous self-centred money grabbing family and retire them for good as soon as possible. If you are looking for a heavy metal album, forget this one."
1,Another greedy record company release,"In regard to the review posted by SUP-RBEAST, I'm not whining and I am an Ozzy fan, but this release should never have happened. The true fans bought the box set and there is no reason that the extra tracks on this release couldn't have been put on there just as easily, but since the record company and the Ozzy camp felt the need to make some more money (as if they both really needed it) they decided to tack on a couple of outtakes from the original sessions and repackage it as ""new"" product. If you want your fans to support you, then you also have to support them by giving them their money's worth and not issuing rehashed product. Everyone is starting to do this now and as long as the public buys it, the record companies will keep it coming. With all that said, the cover versions on here work for the most part, some more than others, so I would have to give it 3 or 4 stars for the music, but the marketing ploy brings it down."
2,A Swift Kick Between The Legs,"Wow. It's amazing what people will do for money. Even double crossing loyal fans. The only thing redeeming about this cd is Jerry Cantrell's guitar work. truly he is one of the most underated guitarists of all time. he gets 5 stars in my book, this cd does not. so Ozzy releases a box set and does the right thing in putting quite a bit of unreleased and new material. then he releases this which has all the stuff you bought the box set for plus 3 or 4 new songs, so if you want all the songs you have to buy this too. A swift kick to the groin indeed."
1,The worst,"Oh how the mighty have fallen. I think the vessel that used to contain Ozzy is just being led around by Sharon. I just listened to ""Rocky Mountain"" way, complete with corny background singers. This stuff looks William Hung look good. Trust me.I am an OZZY fanatic too."
1,What made Ozzy?,Randy Rhoads. RIP mate. Shame your best mate has cashed into you over so many years.
3,sadly a poor cover compilation,"to listen to this is actually painful! Ozzy's vox are very apperently shot to hell and there is no Zak wylde instead you get jerry cantrell I like his work in AIC but here it lacks and ozzy's (I mean sharon's song choices suck badly)with a few exceptions but ozzy has actually covered better songs before born to be wild/purple haze/changes with kelly and more but this in sad don't waste you money,time and ears."
2,I LOVE Ozzy but this SUCKS!,"I don't own every last recording that Ozzy's ever released, but I have most of them, and I can honestly say that this cover album SUCKS.A few tracks are OK, specifically the Beatles' ""In My Life"", but most of the rest are pure crap. Ozzy's voice is apparently really deteriorating and the production, with what sounds like backup lounge singers, is terrible.If you get the dual disc the DVD stuff ain't nothing great either - Ozzy, his son Jack, and LEMMY eating and chit-chatting about nothing all that interesting or funny."
1,Ozzy hits lowest point of career,"This has got to be the worst album from Ozzy ever. I started out with his first album Blizzard of Ozz which was of course awesome!!! Oh yeah don't get the remake where he redid the tracks because he totally screwed it up. Also Diary of a Madman is disgraced. Anyway back to this album he does all these cover tunes and they are a disaster. I listened to this album once and dumped it as fast as I could. If you really want to listen to core Ozzy get the early remasters of Blizzard of Ozz, Diary of a Madman, Bark at the Moon, Ultimate Sin etc."
1,Ozzy sucks.,"Ozzy is nothing but a sellout, overblown, self concerned ego maniac these days, filing lawsuits because he's jealous that the REAL Black Sabbath are showing him what true metal is. This album is terrible and didn't need to be made."
1,"under cover,should stay that way.",I guess it was a matter of time before The King Of Heavy Metal would stoop to this level.There are some singers who can get away with covers and then there are who shouldn't even try.The mere thought of it should be scratched.I do like Ozzy now just not here.It was Woman by John Lennon that I almost laughed myself into a frenzy.Its that bad! Maybe i'll keep it for entertainment value or if I need a laugh lift.Its bad folks thank god it was free cause to any poor sucker who purchased it online or out right Good Therapy is waiting!
5,in response to A Kid's Review,"I too am a big ozzy fan, I enjoyed this album and don't like to see so many people bashing it. but you're a jackass. not to say the majority, but a fair amount of ozzy's hardcore fanbase do also listen to rap, myself included, not to mention ozzy has worked w/ wu tang, dmx, bust rhymes n wat not. so please (in the words of ron white) next time you have a thought, just let it go."
2,Well it is what it is!!,"Well it's ok I guess from a cover point of view, the tune selections are kind of cool and they sound pretty decent for the most part, however this really is just another form of Sharon cashing in on the Ozzy name. If you like this kind of thing pick it up as you'll probably enjoy it, I on the other hand will pass.Ozzy has really let down many of his long time supporters by allowing his wife to just do whatever the hell she wants with his music and his friends. The antics she's pulled over the last few years is bordering on criminal. Erasing the original bass and drum tracks from his first two solo cd's so they wouldn't have to pay both Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake their royalties not to mention the stunt she pulled with Iron Maiden a few months back was the last straw for me. I love Ozzy but he should just go away now and let us remember him as he once was."
2,It's a shame...,"While Courtney Love is releasing Box Sets of her dead husband's work and releasing a CD a year later with 19 songs from that and 3 that werent included, Sharon is doing the same thing to Ozzy. This is a great CD, but including things not included in the box set was just wrong to the fans. These wives need to stop being greedy."
2,Ozzy Undercover,"I don't know what to think about this cd. There are maybe one or two good tracks, but the rest sucks. Ozzy needs to retire... his voice sounds terrible on this cd. It doesen't sound like any work was put into the recording of these songs.I'm sure this is just another release that Sharon forced him to put out (since most of the songs were released in his box set) so that she could go buy another diamond incrusted tiolet, or something stupid like that.Ozzy needs to divorce sharon, and maybe put out some new Black sabbath material.If you love ozzy, and have not heard this cd... trust me, it's better if you don't listen to it."
2,Good News/Bad News is,"You don't have to buy the box set just to get the covers--but that's all they are, cover tunes. You can probably grab them off of Kazaa. The price isn't bad (cheaper on CD Universe though). He does choose some interesting songs to cover though."
1,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAPOLA.............,"OZZY SINGING COVER SONGS.I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THE MASTER OF METAL IS SINGING COVER SONGS. ZACK MUST BE KICKING HIMSELF.OZZY GET IN THE STUDIO AND RELEASE A STUDIO ALBUM, AND QUIT RIPPING OFF THE DIE HARD FANS. SUCH AS MYSELF......."
1,What a piece of sh.it!,"Ozzy Osbourne is the worst metal artist of all time. No talent what so ever. His whiney, monotone singing style is so un-metal, and everybody would have forgotten about this no talent (...)years and years ago if it weren't for that STUPID TV show! You know what a drum machine is? Well if they invented a ""singing machine"" something tells me that it would sound just like Ozzy's robotic, monotone whine. The man simply has a horrible, unmusical voice. Its as if his vocal chords are prothsetic or something! If you're a metalhead who worships Ozzy, its probably just because of ignorance. Go put on any album by Deep Purple, Dio, or Yngwie Malmsteen album to see what real metal vocals are about. It will make you forget all about Ozzy and his cold, sterile, robotic voice."
5,Very durable for 4 & 2 yr old,"Received as a gift. This truck has received an extreme amount of rough play over the past year and half. Kids love it. This toy has been thrown, dropped, crashed, and used in a sand box. All of the mechanics still work. No plastic has broken. I am very surprised."
2,I expected more...,"I expected a lot more from Ms. Jeffries than this book delivered. I have read her books from the beginning and have loved every one of them. A Notorious Love was a disappointment. I did not feel the spark that was clear in the past books. This one seemed flat and after awhile, I got a bit bored.Please do not mistake me. I adore Ms. Jeffries books in general and would recommend any of her others (especially the Lord series). I have great faith that her coming books will be better.P.S. to her publisher: get over the ___ Love titles already!"
2,JUST AN OK BOOK,"I really expected more from Jeffries' latest book. It was an extremely dull setting with even more dull characters. I enjoyed her Lord series very much, but the books after that were really flat. There was much more emotion and spirit with her first trilogy. You could pass on this book"
4,A Notorious Love...Loved it!,"I just could not put the book down! I finished it in less than a day. I thought the two main characters Daniel and Helena were a lot of fun, Daniel the rascal and Helena, the spinster. I laughed at loud at some of their battles and antics.I gave this book four stars because I felt the plot was rather weak. Helena's sister supposedly eloped with an unsavory character and so, she enlists the help of Daniel, a once unsavory character himself at one time to help her find her sister and save her from disgrace.Other than that, I found the book HIGHLY enjoyable. The two main characters just kept the story going."
5,a notorious love,arrived on time and book was in very good shape. i like books that are fast readable and have a good plot.
4,Beauty and the sexy ex-smuggler,"The chemistry between Helena and Daniel is great. She doesn't care about his humble beginnings, but is afraid to let her passion out due to ""Mrs. Nunleys Guide to Etiquette for Young Ladies."" He thinks she's luscious and doesn't even notice her limp. Sparks fly when they are forced to be together in order in order to find Helena's sister Julliet who eloped.Ms. Jeffries maintains her quality writing throughout this book. The characters are quite likeable and the story flows well."
4,Great Alternative to a New Chain!,This little device can prolong the chain life. Be sure that you are using it with the correct chain. Dremel makes them in different sizes. Takes some practice and must be used often.
1,Remaster sounds like butt.,"This CD has the worst mix. Drums sound like poop, and the vocals are in your face, and annoying. This remaster improves nothing except the Zappa's bank account."
4,You Are What You Is,I am listening to it right now for about the 4th time since I recieved it about 2 weeks ago. I'm a fan.I liked then and still liking now.
5,This album reminds me of 'we're only in it for the money',"A more song based album with incredible playing in it, and the sequence feeling of a movie ...a movie for your ears. Zappa really balances humor and sarcasm (which is not really sarcasm...it's just the shocking truth!). I remember listening to this at a friends house in the early 80's and, being the prog head that i was (and still am), i sort of set it aside thinking it had too many vocals. It wasn't until years later when i finally got my self a copy that i realized what a mistake i had made. One of his best more focused works in the rock style. Just great!"
4,A must for true Zappa fans an mabey if you're just starting.,"You are What you Is is the ultamite Zappa Album. True Social commentary, Humorus little ditties, his view at the state of the world at that time and wonderful experiments in the wonderful world of music. However, unlike albums like Sheik Yerbouti and Apostrophe, It is not for all tastes. To some people ears it is just a bunch of noise piled onto one another but to the true Zappa Fanatic it is a symphony of post moderenistic rock music. Be Warned"
4,The best 1/2 of an album ever made,"Unlike the previous posters, this album has never been one of my absolute favorites, although the songs that originally appeared as sides 1 and 3 are among the best that Frank ever did.It's those other two sides, though, where Frank is rather unamusing and, dare I say it, annoying. If he'd left sides two and four in the can, this would have been maybe the best LP Frank ever put out.And what the heck did he do when he remixed this album for CD? I don't remember the vinyl album being so ""Phil Spector""-sounding. Some of these songs are so noisy now they're unlistenable.Still, I recommend this album for the good stuff: Doreen/Goblin Girl, the title track, Mudd Club, The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing, Dumb all Over and a couple of others. Thanks to the invention of the CD player, you can skip over the dreck and get to the goodies.I have a deep desire to never hear ""Conehead"" again as long as I live..."
2,Quality Control,"I realize that Zappa was releasing music to amuse and occupy himself without regard to critical or commercial reception. Nonetheless, far too much of this album sounds half-baked. Employing lyrics that are, on average, mediocre just obscures the technical complexity of the instruments. What might have been a fine instrumental becomes an ad hoc attempt at topicality. Granted, a song like ""You Are What You Is"" succeeds beautifully, but too many of the other songs are unfunny and poorly crafted lyrically. Most of this period is hit and miss in a given album and this proves no exception."
5,My girl loves it - and so do I,"I have been listening to Korblein's first CD many, many times and was eagerly awaiting his encore. I haven't been disappointed - on the contrary. ""When You're Not Here"" documents Korblein's growth as a guitar player and composer. I find his music inspiring and soothing at the same time. It's that kind of stuff that doesn't wear out easily. Highly recommendable!"
4,Punk's Not Dead,"Yeah, the statement is cliche now but this book proves that it once thrived all by itself without the help of media darlings like Blink-182, et. al. who survive only by virtue of the MTV generation. I was especially pleased to see venues local to me displaying their names proudly on fliers, signs that something more real than burnt out Silicon Valley culture once existed in the Bay Area. This book is worth every penny both for those who were there and those who wish they were."
4,comprehenive collection of American punk flyer art,"I'm pleased that Bryan Ray Turcotte and his cohorts managed to preserve and resurrect the sometimes annoying, sometimes stunning epehemal art of the 70s-80s punk scene. This is a nicely-packaged collection of the era's most exciting do-it-youself graphics."
4,"Wonderful, Classic Laurel & Hardy","This video is one of the best Laurel & Hardy films made. It has all of the classic humor, frustration, slapstick, and everything a Laurel & Hardy fan expects to see as well as the emotional, humor laden twist at the end. Well worth it."
5,Great investment and space saver.,"Super easy install, just find studs and screw in some hooks. It looks great in my house, and showcases a nice set of stainless steel pots and pans. I had to hang it diagonal to compensate for the fact the studs don't line up if the rack is perfectly horizontal, but it actually looks better diagonal than it does horizontally, and it makes it easier to access the pans this way."
4,"got it, hung it. it works....only","can't complain. quality is good. hanging was easy. works as planned. i just wish that extra hooks were not so very expensive. i have nested my pans and kettles, have more room, but the cost is prohibitive when it comes to adding more hooks."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"This rack is perfect and just what I was looking for! I have a small, country-themed kitchen. (However, you can choose other colors to make it work with any decorating taste.) This holds six of my Cuisinart pots and pans perfectly. It's the perfect size for a small kitchen, and adds charm, while adding storage. I give it two thumbs up and my top recommendation!"
5,Absolutely Perfect!,The pot rack was just the right size and color. It looks great in my kitchen without creating a barrier between my kitchen and dining room. I love how easy it was to hang and the number of links provided with it mean that it can hang really low if I want. This is just perfect for my kitchen.
5,Great Pot Hanger,"I have a small kitchen and this is ideal. All my pots and pans fit, and I receive many compliments on this item."
1,Cheap wood - don't waste your money,"This product arrived and appeared to be intact, but when I went to install it I noticed that the wood was split. It appeared as though this wasn't picked up during production and that the item was painted after the split occurred.Upon further evaluation it was clear that the wood was inferior and not durable enough for the intended application. We ended up purchasing oak scrap and remaking the piece. The oak cost $2.00."
1,flawed product,"I bought the 3911 because of the s-video input and output. The unit in theory has great features, but in practice it was disappointing. Most notably, the color switched periodically to b/w and sometimes the image was lost altogether. This could be remedied by a gentle bang on the side, although that was not listed as an option in the manual:0! I returned the unit thinking I had gotten a bad unit but the replacement was just the same. So I am returning this one and looking for a different model."
4,Seals Well,"Replacing valve stem seals makes a huge difference. Often times in the past, I had serious engine oil control issues that I initially thought were worn rings or valve guides, even on engines that had recent received cylinder head valve jobs. Instead new high performance valve seals were the solution. No more smoke from the exhaust and excessive oil usage."
5,Great tool,"This tool is really helpful when framing, it will pull nails even whenthey have been driven below the surface of the wood, and even if you bust off the head it can still be pulled. This is the perfect size also. I've seen and used shorter ones, but they don't provide enough leverage."
4,Action,"retrograde, it;s a great movie, theres not one dull moment in any of the sences,I,ve always been a Dolph Lungren fan,When I buy a movie, I look the story line,what is this all about, after checking out the story in detail thats when i buy the dvd.I would recommend this movie to all the fans who like the action."
2,"I like Dolph, but","Bad effects, predictable in every way, they should have paid me to watch it.Sorry Dolph, you can do better"
1,"Laudable aims, well written, but...","...the book is just so much New Age, utopian fluff. Unfortunate..."
5,The book for people who are waking up.,"Conscious Evolution is a comprehensive synopsis of much of the work and thinking being done to 'grease the treads' as humanity eases into the emerging Age of Consciousness, the successor to the Information Age, the cousin of the Industrial Age. This book is a must read for anyone who is 'waking up' - whether they are just beginning to become conscious or they are 'old souls' who want to know about what's going on in the field of consciousness development and human evolution study. Hubbard does a magnificent job presenting a work that facilitates the global transformation into this new era, this historic age for all humanity."
2,Conscious Evolution,"I received the book in a timely fashion. However, for a book rated ""good"" it is filled with passages underlined in pink."
1,"Tired, hackneyed ""modernism""","This book really does not hold up well in today's world. Full of late 1990s exuberance, it adheres to the mantra that progress in the form of technology is going to save us -- a precept with which I wholeheartedly disagree. In my opinion a waste of time."
1,Very poor condition,This book was listed in good condition and it is not for it is badly warped from severe water damage. Let's be honest with the rating of the condition.
2,Good concepts. Mediocre Organization. Poor writing.,"I read this book on the suggestion of Thom Hartmann, author of ""The Prophet's Way"", ""Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight"", ""ADD Success Stories"" and several other Great books. B. M. Hubbard has some really good ideas, but rarely speaks from the standpoint of authority. She uses quotes from other books an average of two times every three pages, which gives the impression that she isn't comfortable just saying ""what is so"", or she isn't sure that what she KNOWS is right. So while the ideas are of the same caliber as other books of this kind, the writing left me feeling like I just finished a discussion with a proslytizing religionist, who attempts to convert other people as a stop-gap measure for her own insecurity. I am not so naive to suggest that no-one should read this book, as I am sure that my own personal filters have something to do with the bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps I have missed something that you will find."
5,Perfect replacement,When my Trane furnace started to make a lot of noise and eventually wouldn't run at all I found that the Draft Inducer Blower had become defective. I shopped online and eventually found that Amazon carried a replacement. I ordered it and received it earlier than the promised delivery time. It was extremely easy to replace as I only had to take out the old unit and drop this one in it's place. The wires and connector were identical to the old one and the new unit also came with a new fiberglass gasket and installation instructions (which I didn't read as it was obvious as to how to replace the blower). I continue to be amazed by the breadth of products carried by Amazon and the quality of service provided.
3,important info,Brave book when it was originally published.A good if outdated gateway to facts about the squatter slums of the world.
1,Worst English Program Ever,"This CD is a joke. The description indicates that it is a ""complete language training program,"" which is completely false. Basically, all kids can do is click on sounds and listen to them. There is really no context. Boring. It's difficult to get the CD to function properly, and there are times when there aren't even any links to click on. One of the worst aspects of the program is that there are description of the sounds and definitions -- all written in ENGLISH. If children are supposed to use the CD to learn the sounds of the language, I can guarantee that they are not reading the lengthy definitions. Another sorry point to the CD is the lack of tech support. There is an email address on the CD case, but when I tried to contact them, the email bounced back. Obviously, the company is out of business, and for good reason. Amazon should no longer sell this product."
3,Hakuba,"The Hakuba blower brush isnt really what I thought it would be. I'm not so fond of the bristles, it seems they sometimes leave streaks on my filters. I was hoping there would be more air pressure from the actual blower, it has a hard time removing some dust, etc."
5,For tilt construction,"While cleaning out the plastic plugs on a 50 panel tilt construction pour we decided to use the Tweaker to pull the half-round plastic out. It easily saved us 8 hours off a 16 hour job. None of the guys had ever seen a tool pop out the plug and clean up the concrete so fast. We clocked it at 30 seconds per plug. It paid for itself in 5 minutes.Get two, mine walked away during lunch."
5,Tweaker,I've been looking for a tool like this for some time. Anyone who does house framing needs one of these. We've all had twisted lumber to deal with. This tool makes it very easy to straighten two by lumber. Highly recommended.
5,Awesome Tool! Simple but smart,"We had an old cracker cabin for weekend use that had been built in bits and pieces over time; a bit of this and a bit of that like many old homes. One area in need of extensive repairs was the front porch - it had all the charm but matching old and new took a lot of elbow grease. Came across this tool and decided anything that could help would be an improvement - this little thing rocks! Simple design, very effective at putting things in their place - Everyone that uses it wants to keep it! Smart item, simple design, great price."
5,The Tweaker does its job and helps keep your hands away from power nailers.,The Tweaker can twist 2X material that is really twisted and it keeps your hands away if you're using a power nailer. My fellow crew members like it as well. I recommend this tool.
5,"GET in Decatur, Indiana","I purchased my first tweaker in a local hardware store several years ago. I used it during the remodeling of our home and found it very useful. Less than a year ago, someone broke into my garage and stole a large amount of my tools. One of the tools I could not find again locally and was unable to replace was the tweaker. I was very happy to find this tool on Amazon.com and ordered it right away. Thank you!"
5,Love the JLO Pants,"JLO has some really cute intimate items. I have the sherpa capris, and they are so comfortable and fuzzy even after they have been washed several times. The ribbon tie waist is very cute added touch. However JLO is known for a pacticular ASSett, and these pants are cut for those of us who would like to accentuate the same. They are very low cut in waistline and once you sit down they are as lowriding as pants can get. I still love them, and I paid around $16 when I picked minw up on sale at Robinsons May."
2,What a disappointment,"Well, last month I finally bought this much-coveted Cuisinart food processor. I thought I would love it, and intially, I did. Then, I used it for the second time and it completely stopped working midway through my culinary creation. ""Is it overheated?,"" I thought, even though I doubted it could be possible since it was not processing anything particularly heavy like dough, etc. It finally started working again, after I did every troubleshooting maneuver suggested by the direction booklet. Yesterday, I started to make coleslaw and the same thing happened, only this time the ""on"" display light flickered weakly when I attempted to operate it. I abandoned both my coleslaw and my Cuisinart. Bed, Bath & Beyond took it back without any hassle and my KITCHEN AID FOOD PROCESSOR is being shipped as I type this. Buyers beware of the Cuisinart!!!"
3,A historical novel atypical of James Webb,"Not his best work to date. Slow uneventful story profiling the life of one of Macarthur's aides during WWII. Military actions, a love story and lessons learned for the main character. Don't start reading Webb with this - try A Sense of Honor."
3,Not one of his better books...,"Certainly not in the same class as 'Fields of Fire', 'A Sense of Honor', or 'Something to Die For.'I thought the plot was unbelievable, and after reading the book I thought it was a disguised attack on MacArthur's character. Certainly Webb had a bone to pick with someone when he wrote this book.I think Webb is at his best when he writes about the things he has experienced or holds strong opinions on, and less so when he writes as a cynic. Yes, there are elements of cynicism in all of the books in the first sentence, above, but they are more in line with a disgust at the lack of moral courage shown by the various high-level characters. In this book the cynicism and lack of moral fiber has spread to the protagonist himself.Somewhat of an entertaining read, but IMO the best Webb book is 'A Sense of Honor,' where the protagonist is really a dual character... each comprising a part of the author (IMO)."
5,Excellent!,"Exceptional piece of historic fiction. The characters are vivid and realistic. The historical background is very well laid out and comes alive in the context of this excellent novel. This book has it all--history, war, romance, intrigue. Very highly recommended!"
4,Informative,"We have been saturated with post World War punishment and reconstruction of Germany. However, for some reason there had been very little non academic books written with the back drop of Japan and how we dealt with all the complicated issues concerning the differences in our two cultures in our efforts to remold Japan. This book opened my eyes somewhat and I found it very interesting. It contains history, inside information, intrigue and romance"
5,They Got away With It!,"James Webb's novel is based on the fictional story of one of General Mac Arthur's aids. One Captian Jay Marsh.Based immediatly after the liberation of the Phillipines and then the defeat of Japan. Webb takes us on a journey of mystery and intruge that still surrounds the favourable peace terms offered to Japan.It is known that Mac Arthur favoured a hurriedly established democratic government in Japan, mainly to stave off the threat of Communisim that was slowly overhauling the Asian mainland. Webb deals with this issue in the dramatic style he is known for.I could continue but that would spoil the story."
5,WHAT A FIND!,"Webb brought his characters, both real and fictional to life. The studies of McArthur and the Japanese royal family are fascinating. A close relative of mine was captured in Bataan and survived imprisonment [author, Lester Tenney of ""My Hitch in Hell""] and has talked often about his feelings, both good and ambivilent about his Japanese captors and emotionally concerning McArthur and General Wainwright. While, I was hardly walking when these events took place, I spent many years working directly with, and studying the Japanese,their culture and language. After reading ""The Emperor's General"", much like Clavell's novels, I now have a clearer perception of ""Majime."" I highly recommend Webb's book to anyone who is interested in history, military or otherwise and Asian culture. I will look forward to reading ""Fields of Fire."""
3,"Good , but not her best .","I read this in one sitting and I have to say that personly ...I didn`t enjoy as much as the Sonja Blue novals . I love when authors try somthing different , but there are times where trying somthing different is not always going to work . This book is inbetween that notion . It went too fast . As I read this book I could almost see as a cable movie . That`s what it felt like to read Angels on Fire . I love Nancy Collins works , yet this book just dosen`t capture you as other writings do . Yet all in all it was a a good book . But this is my opinoin ."
3,"Great cd player, poor representation",On Amazon.com and Audiovox.com they both say that the CE144B has Bass boost. When you recieve the product and read through the manual it does not state how to turn on the Bass boost. I then called Audiovox and they said the bass boost feature was excluded when they manufactured the product. I would recomend the cd player but it does not have bass boost and it does not have good headphones.
5,My Two-Year Old's Favorite Birthday Present,"My son received this as a gift for his 2nd birthday and fell in love at first sight. He only had eyes for this fire truck for the rest of his party. Two days later, it is still his favorite toy. I like that it does not require batteries, but still makes some noises. I really think this toy has staying power because there are some features of the toy that my son has not figured out yet. I think he'll have fun with it for a long time."
3,Is not durable,"This toy broke my heart because my son LOVED it. He played with it non-stop the evening we first got it for him. Unfortunately, it immediately broke - the engine just stopped revving up and the truck no longer moved forward. I quickly exchanged it, thinking it was a defective product. The second truck we got lasted just a few weeks longer. My son seems to love WOW cars but I am worried about getting them since we have had some bad luck with their durability.UPDATE (6/25/12): WOW sent us a replacement toy after my husband complained a few different ways, including writing on their Facebook wall. It took awhile but I think I wanted to give the company credit."
2,Not durable,"My son received this Christmas day, it's already broken... one week later. He only played with it a couple of times as he's still overwhelmed with all his new Christmas toys so I'm flabbergasted at the durability! The gears don't wind anymore so the engine barely moves forward. And technically, I think I did all the pushing for him (so less than 20 pushes) as he really only played with the opening compartments and the fireman. He's always supervised with his toys so I know there's been no abuse, but he's 21 months old... right in the correct age range for this toy. Don't know what to do with it now as it was a gift. Wow offers a 10 year satisfaction... the joke is... you have to keep the barcode from the box as well as the receipt & mail it to their office (in London? - how much is THAT going to cost!?) for a replacement."
5,Great Toy,My son received this fire truck for his 2nd birthday. He absolutely loves this truck. It is well built and I like that it does require batteries. The faster and longer he pushes the truck around the more and increasing revving sound it makes. The revving sound might get a little too much sometimes but still can't say enough about how much he likes to play with this.
5,His Favorite Gift.,"My son just had his second birthday party. He loved it! Good food. Lot's of people. Festive environment. The highlight turned out to be about a half dozen helium balloons, all tightly up against the ceiling with their ribbon banners trailing down. He pulled on them and dragged them around the house with glee.Then came the presents. Well, it's hard to judge what a two-year old might like. Some presents caused almost no reaction, some caused a bit of a stir, and then a little red WOW Fire Engine really got his attention. He immediately started pushing it around and loved the way it made little fire-engine noises. He cranked the ladder up and down and rotated it side to side and in made little clicking ratchet noises. Well, that was just the first reaction. The next day when all the excitement of the party had died down, his favorite toy turned out to be, you guessed it, the little red WOW Fire Engine. I suspect it's going to get a lot of use.Gary Peterson"
1,"Move Along, There's Real Music Somewhere Else.",I agree with many of the other reviewers -- Aphasia has nothing to say and they don't say it very well.
1,"Absolute, and total crap.","This was filed under dance at best buy. i have no idea why. this is uninspired crap, not a single ounce of originality. kinda like everything else that is mainstream these days. a complete waste of time. i'd rather listen to Yanni."
4,Rock-solid modern rock,Fact: Aphasia's latest album is full of rock-solid modern rock rhythms and brash but tuneful vocal performances. Fiction: They're just another whiney cry-baby band.
2,Overcooked prose,"Evidently this book was meant to appeal to adults as well as children through its use of grown-up language, and while I can't speak for my kids (to whom I read a couple of the stories), I found the writing off-putting. The prose put me in mind of what I imagine one would find in a supermarket bodice-buster. The authors demonstrate a distinct fondness for one-word sentences, breathy declarations of undying love between characters, and the word ""gossamer."" For me, too much gossamer lends a certain heavy quality to the text. Pretty pictures, though."
3,"Too, thin.","these cut-off wheels seemed like a bargain at half the ordinary price, BUT they wear down too quickly! Cutting through a piece off 1/4"" aluminum the wheel was gone in no time. if this is Dremels' Heavy Duty type of cut-off wheel i can't imagine their average wheel lasting more than a few seconds! so much for bargains. I will stick to the thicker, larger wheels that last longer."
4,Buy the thicker wheels,These work preety good. I was pushing the performance envelope as I was using them to make initial cuts into fiberglass and some soft metals. The thinner wheels just fall apart right away.
2,False advertising,"Doesn't work as well as it's supposed to, and looks nothing like the photos. So go to the nearest hardware store and you'll find the same thing for a better price."
3,Sharksaw replacement blade,"The price of the replacement blade is too expensive. The blade cuts quickly with little effort as it cuts on the pull stroke. This saw is excellent for flush cutting of molding, trim or dowels. The coarse teeth on one side of the blade cut aggresively even in white oak but I nicked a hidden finish nail and with one stroke, the blade was completely ruined, leaving only the fine cut side of the blade intact. I'm reluctant to order 2 replacement handles because I guestion the longevity of the saw's plastic handle."
4,shark saw sharp and flexible,The blade is good for fine cutting. I like the fine tooth side of the blade. The side with the larger teeth is very hard to control. I wish they made a replacement blade with both sides with fine teeth.
5,Save Money - Just replace the blade,"These pull saws are the best! I often use them instead of a power saw, especially when accuracy is important. They cut much faster and waste much less material than most hand or power saws. Sadly, none of the stores around here stock the replacement blades. These are exact replacement blades that fit my handle perfectly."
2,not great for dog nails,"i used this like, 3 times for my 10lb mini poodle's nails and then it became useless i.e. i'd try to file her nail down but nothing would happen. i kept trying to press harder and then finally realized the sand paper was smoothed down too far to sand anything down. i'm sticking with the larger drums that came with the dremel nail grinder. the big ones work fine anyway. no real reason to get the smaller one in my opinion, unless you have a super tiny hamster dog."
1,conned by false advertisements,i was tricked into buying this product because i bought it in good faith on the description but it failed to inform me of a very important fact; i could not use the tool because the dremel i purchased was not compatible with the Australian standards.
4,Fishy,This is a very cute wastebasket. We have fish as a theme in our spare room and these are a whimsical addition.
3,Solid tent,"Don't know how well it will hold up in the long run, but it held up to incredible windstorms at burning man that would have destroyed my department store tent. The hexagon shape sheds wind really well. This design started out as a backpacking tent, though this is clearly a car camping tent. The full fly that reaches to about 10inches off the ground should make this tent a good performer in wet weather also.Eureka's quality is not what it used to be, but It's still superior to the cheap stuff you will typically find at Walmart/Academy. Unfortunately there probably is not any better made stuff out there since all most tents are now made off shore somewhere. The poles were heavy and didn't impress me coming out of the box, but they were unphased by the wind."
4,Eureka tent,"I used had used other Eureka tents in the past and they are very well built and designed. This one is no exception. Easy to set up and roomy. Use a tarp under it to preserve the integrity of your floor and smooth your ground inside. it folds in a handbag size package easy to carry by one person. It could accomodate more people, but it is very comfortable for two. Great tent!If you need to anchor it, buy extra rope."
1,ZIPPERS????,"The zippers fouled out the second time we used it. For the price , you would think they would have used a little better materials in the construction of it. One of them just got stuck and the other one split apart and it no longer zips togeather."
1,Bad Warranty,"I've had a Eureka tent for some time (20+ years) and I've used it about a dozen times. The tent is in excellent!!! shape (Always had tarps on the ground and inside on the floor). Recently, the waterproofing started to break down and the fabric has become sticky. I contacted Eureka and they will not replace or recoat the fabrics as they said it is part of the natural breakdown of the fabric's waterproofing and not covered under their warranty. Their warranty makes reference to not covering wear and tear and exposure type defects but my tent has been ""stored indoors in the original bag"". Ahh, says Eureka, the tent has been stored in it's original bag and that accelerates the breakdown hence they are not responsible. To bad the bag does not say somethng like ""do not store tent in bag""Bottom line, great tent but don't expect much from their warranty."
2,seriously flawed,I agree with the previous review that the main problem with ths product is that it rolls down under the bra and creates a roll/ridge across the rib cage-- not attractive! I saw that they now offer what seems to be the same product but modified with little straps that hook over your bra which should alleviate the problem this version suffers from.
1,Not Worth It,I plan on exercising but I bought this to help boost my confidence. I ordered these right from spanx and just recieved this yesterday. It did (ok) for the first day but today forget it. It rolls down the back and it doesnt smooth anything out. You have to keep pulling the back part up. The legs look like someone took sizzers to them and chopped them off. Maybe they have something better than these. I hope so because I want my money back.
4,Good but not what I expected,"My favourite Zappa orchestral music is the symphonic-type pieces on Lumpy Gravy with strings and all. I was expecting some of that, but there really isn't any on it. There are a lot of the small ensemble orchestral pieces though."
1,Not Son-In-Law Resistant,I had a similar pry bar for 20 years and it worked excellently. For all I know it is still working fine for the *&%#@ that stole it. I ordered the Fulton unit and used it lightly. It has a very smooth finish to the top of the head that makes hardly any mark on the wood when pulling a nail. The nail pulling slots won't pull anything smaller than 16d nails. My son-in-law borrowed it and broke the weld between the handle and the head. He was tearing up a bathroom floor.
2,Not the same as pictured,"The bar is a quality made tool. However, the product I received us not the same as the picture. The flat ""blade"" end is not as wide as the one in the picture. To most it wouldn't be an issue, but in my line of work and what I specifically use this tool for, it is."
5,Great guide to Palmistry,"I used this book to help get my friends into my interests, and it worked great. There's lots of infomation in here and it's all easy to read and understand, and even in sensible order unlike some other books I've gotten. Not to mention it's an amazing deal buying used on Amazon for this book. Alot of the infomation you'll find from your hand is true, although sometimes it doesn't seem like it, you'll find it closer to home then you think. I keep it out on my table for quick referance and to read whenever the urge hits. I fully reccomend this book."
2,"Concerned with quality, construction","I bought the JVC for the S-vidio capability. I was disappointed with the quality, especially the all plastic construction. I had some problems with color -- picture appeared in b/w. The last straw was the motor made noticible noise during PLAY mode. I just couldn't feel good about this purchase. This appears to me an extremely cheap-quality player with S-Video tagged on. I returned it and am shopping for a better quality VCR for [the price]. I decided I can live w/o the S-Video."
3,Sorry Counter,It is a pretty good VCR except that you can not tell see the counter on the VCR while rewinding or fastforwarding. It would be a great VCR if it could do that.
2,Not the most user friendly VCR,"It looks good sitting on top of the DVD player, the picture and sound are decent. So why am I not happy? I have used VCRs for more years than I care to admit. I have never, since my first archaic VCR had a problem programming them to record a show in the future even without opening the user manual. The programming of this VCR is not at all user friendly! You would think to just hit the menu or program button and be on your way following a step by step menu to set time, date, etc. But not on this VCR. But even if you get past that part, I was frustrated because I could not just punch numbers to set the time and date for recording, it had to be done by half hour increments for time (without an am/pm toggle no less) and day increments for date. I do not have time for that when I am trying to program the VCR on my way out the door to work. I want to hit the numbers and keep it moving. I typically love JVC products but this appears to be a poor relation."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"This is a great book for all those fans of the ""COMBAT!"" TV show, produced in the 1960's. I highly recommend it if you have invested in the ""COMBAT!"" DVD's or if you just want to understand why this series was, and indeed still is, so popular. Ms. Davidsmeyer even included her hand written autograph in my copy!--A wonderful and unexpected surprise!!! Indeed, this entire book is ""A wonderful and unexpected surprise! You'll enjoy it without a single doubt!"
5,A must have for Combat lovers.,Jo Davidsmeyer's reviews of the Combat episodes is a wonderful tool for those of us who love the Combat series. She has wonderful insight into each episode and the added extra tidbits of Combat trivia add to the mix. Sergeant Saunders - the savior of the free world.
4,The Jonas Brothers are not bad singers.,"I know I have slammed the last two groups/singers I reviewed(Hannah Montana and Aly and AJ)but I have to say the Jonas Brothers aren't bad at all. They sound good and seem to be rather entertaining from what I have seen. I usually don't like slow songs but When You Look Me In The Eyes by the Jonas Brothers is actually a good song. I think the Jonas Brothers are a fresh cool group for all ages to enjoy. I think they have great personalites and their whole vibe is neat. If you want proof that the Jonas Brothers are a good band, just watch a video of one of their concerts and check out the screaming fans! The Jonas Brothers songs also give a clear message that is easy to understand unlike Aly and AJ who leave me confused. The Jonas Brothers actually have vocal talent unlike some other kid stars. I would say a Jonas Brothers Album is money well spent!"
5,This MADE my daughters Christmas complete!!,"This is the only thing that my 7 year old was wanting for Christmas. She has listened to the C.D. so much, (some songs over & over again!!) She also liked the DVD that came with it! Well worth the little extra money for the DVD!!"
5,Amazing!!!,"This CD is absolutley amazing! The Jonas Brothers have terrific voices, amazing guitar talents and write beautiful songs. I listen to this CD almost everyday! You should most deffinetly buy it!"
1,My sons did not like this music.,Not impressed with the Jonas Brothers. My kids talked me into getting the CD with another purchase so I could qualify for Free Super Saver Shipping and it was a waste of money.
