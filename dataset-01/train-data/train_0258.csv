3,The National Enquirer version of Papal History,"When there's a long line at the supermarket check-out, I pass the time by reading the Enquirer, the Star, and Soap Opera Digest. This book fullfills that illicit pleasure of getting the inside merde on the inhabitants of Peter's Throne. If one believes that the Pontiffs are next to God in the human order of things, then one must be offended by the nature of this free-flowing and eminently readible selection of papal history.If one wishes a ""serious"" history of the Papacy, then one should go to McBrien's ""Lives of the Popes"" or Eamon Duffy's ""Saints and Sinners."" But if you like the Star, or the New York Post, then this is the book for you, since it is totally uncluttered with footnotes and proofs of scholarly accuracy. In that respect, it rivals Woodward's histories of Boy Clinton. A sheer delight to have and to hold, from this day forth."
2,Poorly researched and poorly written,"Meh. I think this book had some substantial inaccuracies -- Lucrezia Borgia, for example, was actually a decent woman who never committed any incest or killed anybody (though her dad and brother are another story). I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as I thought I would; I thought it was shallow as well as sloppily researched."
3,Not his best,"Personally, I cringe whenever Silver's songs are given lyrics and sung. Silver's a mediocre lyricist at best. His all-instrumental albums like ""Hard Bop Grandpop"" or ""Prescription For the Blues"" show him at his recent best. But if you're a Silver fan, you'll eventually want to pick this one up, too, for there is some fine music here."
5,"I, Cladius, - I Enjoyed","I saw this drama when it first aired, many, many years ago. I was great to watch then and it was great to watch again."
4,A classic!!,"Picture quality is only fair, which is understandable since this is from a 35-year-old BBC broadcast. Supposedly the recently released 35th Anniversary Edition (available on DVD) is better. Would be nice if Amazon Instant made that version available for streaming."
3,"No credit given to ""supporting actors""","In the trailer the people that are in the movie the most are not even featured. They are listed as supporting actors when they were the main actors so I felt that was misleading. Fun movie over all but the directing left something to be desired. Really like the long haired metal looking guy (young one), he is a lot of fun to watch and should have gotten a lot more credit in my opinion."
1,dont waste your money,"Too slow, gets clogged alot. My hand crank strainer is much better to use even with all its problems."
1,Is this for real?,"What a leaky, messy contraption! Got the tomatoes ready. Assembled the thing, and placed containers to catch the juice & pulp and the seeds and skins. Oh boy! Of course I might have had a better experience if I had not been laughing so hard. And yes, Virginia, it got on me and my clothes. I sent a note to KitchenAid and---they did not respond. At all. Who is KitchenAid hiring these days?"
5,easy to use and fast shipping too,"Shipping was quick and painless, use of the product, not tough at all. Let my neighbors pet monkey use it to make banana puree."
3,Don't use for blackberries,"This strainer works okay for tomatoes, but don't expect to use it for blackberries, even if you cook the berries some to soften the seeds. I tried to de-seed blackberries with mine and it clogged up suddenly, brought the mixer to a dead stop, then split the screen wide open down the seam. Not one word in any of the Kitchenaid documentation about not using it for blackberries, either. Now, it's going to cost me $50 to replace the screen. Thanks Kitchenaid! Buyer beware."
5,loveit!,I used this for making applesauce and love it! I wish I could use it for concord grapes but it is fabulous for applesauce!
3,Not the results I expected,I thought this would replace the need for a food mill. Not quite. This would be better if you could vary the size of the holes in the screen. I don't like it for tomato sauce. I do use it when making spinach lasagna to get all of the water out of the spinach (the spinach is really bone dry when I'm done which was what I wanted.)Update 3/21/06 I made applesauce yesterday with this attachment and it was wonderful.
5,Making tomato juice,This is a wonderful attachment for the Kitchen Aid Mixer. I have made lots of tomato juice this year and the attachment made it so easy. I have always avoided making juice because it was so hard and time consuming.
3,"Does the trick, but time consuming","Have used only once so far. Prepared sweet potatos and apples. A dream for apples. Not so for sweet potatoes, had to pass through the sweet potatoes several times and clear the gunk twice to get just three potatoes to pass through. So this is not the end all be all for straining, however if you are an apple sauce fan... or other similar fruits...it's a dream. Lots of parts to assemble/dissemble and clean. Also instructions advise cooking foods before straining, so this is a multi-step process. Parts are sturdy, expect it to last a long time. Most certainly is far better than pushing foods through strainer by hand! Really need blender for some foods and this strainer for others to have complete coverage of baby food straining capabilities. Note: this item requires the food grinder to complete the parts needed to function."
2,Kitchen Aid strainer,"I'm sure it's a good product but it did not fit on my older model Kitchen Aid and by the time i realized that (summer, canning time) it was too late to return."
3,not for grapes,"The product description should have said it has limitations. The Kitchenaid mixer is a great machine and some of the other addons (meat grinder, ice cream maker) are ok."
4,The wonder machine.,"I have had my kitchen aide for about 25 years. My husband has rebuilt it twice. Yes, you can get parts. We had a farm and I used it for straining tomatoes, blackberries,pumpkin and various other produce. It was a great tool for all. It gets stuck once in a while, but just wash it off and get going again."
5,Amazing!,This thing is such a time saver it isn't even funny. I canned 20 quarts in a little less than 2 hours. I ran out of stove room before I ran out of applesauce to put in jars. Love it. Clean up was a piece of cake. I want to try it on grapes and other items. Can't wait to use again next year.
4,I love this attachment but the tray could have been bigger.,"I love this so far, I made tomatoe juice and it was sooo much better than hand cranking it. I also used a squeezo and I did like the KitchenAid over it. The squeezo gave it a weird metalic taste because it was made of aluminum and the KitchenAid is made of stainless steel which I love."
5,BINGO - WE HAVE A WINNER!,"Awesome!!! 2 bushels of tomatoes for sauce (yes, I say sauce, NOT GRAVY)1 bushel of apples for apple butter...mmmm....Made canning this year much easier! I didn't blanch the romas, just put them right through this new toy. I will advise you that you can pass the ""waste"" throught a couple times for more 'meat & juice' - it will still not allow the skin & seeds through, which again, is AWESOME!!! I love you kitchen aid!"
4,My most used appliance in the house!,"Oh how this attachment gets a workout in the fall. I've done quarts and quarts of tomatoes for sauce through this gizmo and haven't had it fail yet. It works great with making applesauce and pear sauce, too! Ive even strained strawberries, peaches, raspberries and blueberries through it for jelly.My only complaint is cleaning the mesh cone. The pulp gets stuck in the holes and can be hard to get out. With a baby cleaning brush, it is possible.My kids, have enjoyed making sauces almost as much as I have. Highly recommended!"
5,What a time saver!,I use this to make homemade pasta sauce using home grown tomatoes and it does an unbelievable job. This past summer I put up over 50 quarts of sauce (that's about 500-600 tomatoes) and it didn't skip a beat. I look forward to using it for other endeavors when I have time.
5,DOES WHAT THE TITLE INDICATES,"IMHO, THE REVIEWER FROM CALIF. IS MISGUIDED. THE BOOK IS ONLY A PRIMER, AND A VERY GOOD ONE AT THAT. NOTHING IS PERFECT, AND NIETHER IS THIS BOOK, BUT IT SATISFIED MY GOAL OF BEING A VERY GOOD PRIMER ON EMBEDDED SYSYTEMS."
2,Too basic,"This book gives a solid overview of embedded systems and how they work in conjunction with hardware and software, but it does not give enough in depth analysis of embedded systems. For example, the book tries to show how to write certain software for embedded applications, but gives too generic examples using a created language called ""C!"" It would be more effective of a book if it had actual examples of embedded software such as device drivers, etc. Otherwise, it does a solid job of explaining the basics of different interrupts, semaphores, etc."
2,Way to basic!,"It's just what it say ""a primer"". This book seems like it would be great for someone who has never programmed for embedded systems. However, if you have even a few months experiance under your belt, this book is a big waste of time. I purchased this book to use a quick refresh after being away from embedded programming for a few years. Sent it back after reading about 25% and skimming the rest."
5,Kim Rocks!,"Kim Wilde's fifth album is her attempt to break through into the dance market. ""You keep me hanging on"" is a great song that has already hit number one on the US charts. There are many more good songs on this albums, and it ranks as one of her best to date."
3,Wrong size,"It's actually matted for an 8x10, not 11x14. Don't be fooled like I was. No time to get something else, so I had to make do. Disappointed."
4,Christmas gift,"I had the product shipped to another address as I was going to make Christmas presents with it. Both arrived on time however 1 had the glass broken in the corner. I believe it could have been wrapped with more bubble wrap and would have been ok. I did not have the time to return so I had a piece of glass cut and all is well. Yes, I would purchase again as I feel if I had the time to return the product you would have taken care of it. Thank you. My Christmas gift will be a great hit!"
4,Great for Young Children,"I was surprised how thin this book is when I received it. There are large color photos on each page and very large print. It is very basic but manages to give some great information in limited words. Of course it doesn't go on to explain ""Why?"" - But is great to start a conversation and good jumping off point to get children to want to know more about the ocean. Our 5 year old asked a lot of questions before turning to the next page, so the book is good for getting children interested and leaves them yearning to learn more."
2,Book,The book was in a ok condition. I was disappointed that all of the posters was missing and wasn't motioned in the description.I had to buy another book to replace the posters because it was a b-day present and the posters were missing.
3,"Works, but ill fitting","I would have given this product 5 stars for the functionality, but because it is such an ill fit, I couldn't.I'm not sure if it was just the one I received, but the hooks did not align well at all with the unit.As far as it doing what it was designed to do, it works great."
4,Cap barbell 35lb black olympic weight plate,Great addition to my Olympic weight set. It's deep design and high contrast white lettering make it very easy to handle and user-friendly.
2,Not the disney version - and a little weird,"it's a little weird - this isn't the disney one, and it's pretty strange. My 2.5 year old loves it, but i'm going to rebuy the real one as this is tooo strange for me."
3,Pretty good cover for the money,"The Krusell case is nicely made and seems to be of a quality that will hold up. The fact that one can flip the back away to take pictures is handy and the back protects the lens of the camera.The downside is that the case is a little too tight for the Treo 680. The Treo wants to ride up and the case gets in the way of using the buttons. This is especially true of the on/off button, dial button, and the top of the four-way button."
2,Very average but Liotta is convincing,this film for the most part has pretty typical COp CLiche Hollywood stories.Kurt Russell is just not Convincing at all.MadeLeine Stowe really doesn't add anything aside from her beauty.but Ray Liotta despite being Scum through out this film is the only reasong to watch it.
4,a creepy highly provocative thriller,"kurt russell and madeline stowe play a normal husband and wife when suddenly there house is broken into by a theif. so they call the police played by ray liotta and his partner. and as soon as madeline stowe comes down the stairs and ray liotta looks at her that way you can tell he has problems. so ray liotta starts following them around all over and wants the wife so he frames kurt russell and puts him in jail so that ray liotta can be with madeline stowe. but when kurt gets out it will be a showdown between him and ray. rated r for strong violence,language,sexuality and nudity."
5,Now this is a suspenseful thriller!!!,"This movie has all the right elements, and creates one entertaining and suspenseful movie! Ray Liotta was just remarkable in this movie, and those interesting eyes of his makes you think you are looking into the pools of insanity! The movie is so suspenseful, I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the conclusion... which didn't let me down for a second. This is one excellent movie, and I highly recommend it."
4,Good movie,"I wish they still made movies like this, or any movie from the 90s. A good suspense movie with Ray Liotta as a psycho cop terrorizing a couple after their house gets broken into."
4,A ZEN parable,"Nothing Above is a place where there is no higher or lower, no positive or negative, no superior or inferior, no right or wrong, no good or bad, no intelligence or stupidity, no victories and no defeats. A place where there is nothing to wait for, nothing to follow, nothing to reach, and nothing to understand. No goals, no scope, no purpose, no objectives. A place where everything is an opportunity."
4,A very nice shirt for the price,"I've purchased a number of items from Jos A. Banks over the years, and I've been happy with the quality of their products.I purchased this shirt a while back so that I could have a nice french cuff shirt at a reasonable price. This fits the bill. It is a comfortable shirt, fits well and looks good on me (at least I think so!). I have a small collection of cuff links I inherited from my father, and I like to think about him when I wear his cuff links. Since you have to have a french cuff shirt to wear cuff links, I've purchased several from various makers.I unreservedly recommend this shirt for an inexpensive way to add a bit of panache to one's wardrobe. It's fun to wear and I've been happy with the way it looks. I've only worn it a few times, so I can't comment on the longevity of this item, but based upon my experiences with other Jos A. Banks products in the past, I think it will pass that test as well.Recommend."
4,you need a talent!!!!,"you need a talent!!!! this is a very low qulity movie, but its a movie that had to be made! people want to skip to the part where they are famous and have to answer to no one. you need to do something first.that is what i got from this movie. its is so bold and in your face that the main lady in the movie has zero skill but wants the fame. what do you do? tell her to go work at Mc Donalds!!!but she wont listen. why? because she is a FAME WHORE!"
3,Casio Bleak,The casio comes without the software I thought was typical for all medium level pdas. This was a big disappointment! I looked for additional software and it doesn't seem as if any is interesting to me so I am going to get a hp
4,there's lots of potential here for this little machine,"I wanted something color, had an IPAQ 3100 series, and used it a lot, but not most of its features i.e. the IR port or the speaker. I saw this machine and the price and the CF and battery life and it looked like enough for me functionally. It has been a great machine. Upgraded the GUI to the EPODS shell, which works and looks great. Software is scanty for this, it is not a pocketpc, but I only take notes and use the scheduler anyway. The GOTYPE keyboard works great with it. So, if you know what you need, and you know what this machine does and what kind of resources are and aren't available for it, you'll be happy."
1,Slow Recall,"I have owned this unit. It's processor was very slow when searching a contact. It took up to 20 seconds. I have always had Casio PDA's, but had to trade this one in for a Toshiba."
3,Powerful but limiting,This Pocket Manager is exactly what it is it does not have any advanced features without puchasing them through Casio the only programs that I have found that where not Casio is on .... Thi product information does not include the complicated sync process.And the fact that Casio wrote it own modified version of Windows C.E. But with thw thinngs that I currently have for the item from Casio run fine and this manager has a speedy 16 bit 166Mhz processor. I would recommend this product if you are a user that does not need the more advaned features. I don't recommend this if you enjoy the use of the adavanced features. Right now i am deciding if i should return this item for a hp or a compaq. sine i have had it the software has doulbled. Where is the unexpected Extra?
2,The price dictates quality and support,"This device, which I received for Christmas a year ago, is joke. It has no good software, and the screen is a little small. I tried to use Mazingo on it, but it oculdn't process fast enough, nad would crash. No IR port, and the keyboard I bought was a knockoff that Casio Just decided to use again, and the BE-300 was no match. Listening to MP3's was impossible while typing, because no task manager to run multiple taks s at once, and the jack was at the bottom. Finally, it recently crashed for good. Casio's hours are 9-5, when I am at school andparents are at work. I emailed them, but no response. So I now am buying a Dell Axim X5 in hopes of a better product, b/c I have heard/read that the Dell is best for the money."
4,Great But not so,"The product was good, but it is heavy and bulky. There are only couple hundred programs compared to a couple thousand for palm devices. But I like the nice screen and ma glad I only paid 150.00 for, I thought with the screen it could easily make up for the weight and bulkiness. Also the Costomer service is terrible,(Like they don`t know what they are doing)"
4,"Exellent PDA, with good features","I have a BE-300, and Its great. I recently installed a new FREE OS for it called Expod (...) (now called PP3x), which takes TOP-MENU, the default OS off. It gives the BE PPC2000 compatability. I just wished that it had a GPS adapter for it, that is one reason I purchased it. I dont know of anywhere that sells one. Even though, I can hook my celular phone into it, and connect to the internet, I can also connect to E-mail, and I can even listen and watch movies and music. You can also emulate, old computer consoles, and old game consoles such as nintendo, and Atari. I think it is a great value at a great price. Even though there is no GPS adapters available."
2,This is NOT a Pocket PC,"This is a pocket organizer based on CE software.What does that mean?It cannot use 99% of the existing PocketPC software. Casio is promoting products to compile versions to work with the BE, but currently there is virtually nothing."
1,Too Good to be true,"I was looking for compatibility with certain Win CE Programs.It tells you nowhere that it has its own Casio Proprietary customized operating system, that does not allow running Active Sync (which is the interface between your PC and this dumb PDA)Instead it has a program called ""PC Connect"" and very few programs have been written for it. Very dissapointing and deceiving"
2,"Worst of the bunch, I would say.","This Pocket PC may have been glorious a whiles back, but to whoever reviewed it in April of 2002 and called it the greatest Pocket PC out there is by far wrong.The innards of this Pocket PC are standard - the same as every other Pocket PC. The same 206mhz Processor, same 320x240 screen.Now we come to the form factor of these Casio PPCs. Ew ew ew! Boxy, fat, and plain ugly! Then, look at the Audiovox Maestro, the shapeliest PPC on the market. It has all the same stuff, except 32MB less RAM. And several hundred dollars cheaper. You can easily remedy the RAM problem for much cheaper than the price difference, and you still have a beautiful form factor. Check out the form sizes.The reviewers who call this machine amazing are really reviewing the amazing features of PPC2002 operating system. Not the Casio Pocket PC.Go with the Audiovox Maestro, for hundreds of dollars less, and better form factor...You'll see that this Casio's not worth the terrible price."
5,AWESOME ALL U NEED 2 NO IS ITS AWESOME,This is an awesome Pocket PC. I used to have a Palm IIIC. Then it broke. I was lookin for an affordable Pocket PC instead of a palm pilot. The Casio Cassiopeia BE-300 is AWESOME!!!!!!! If your lookin for a nice affordable Pocket PC I recomend it 2 u! This is way cooler then Palm Pilots even though there arent as many applications for it as palm has. 1 really cool feature is The MP3 player. If you want alot of songs I recomend gettin a 128 MB card for it.
2,Good Try,This may seem nice for the outside but on the inside it seems to have fallen short on it's operating system. This PDA's OS was based on Windows CE but it is not win CE. There for it is harder to get software that is compadable with it. The one good thing that it does have is it's MP3 player which sounds good but is a little weak when it comes to being able to control a some.
1,I could have had a lot of Quarter-Pounders...,"After pointing out that the Casion BE300 does have a backlit screen and many adjustments, I just discovered that I can't transfer my Microsoft Outlook Address Book to the unit.I'm retired now, but don't have an infinite number of years to figure it out, and refuse to go back and key everything in with a stylus.So, back in the box it goes, to be disposed of at a flea market, or maybe I'll send it to a 35-year old kid I know who has lots of time to play with it.I see it's being sold as a clearance item. Not surprised.Ah well, live and learn. Or so they tell us.Steve Quinn."
4,Great value,"This system has excellent color 32K not 256 like the HP525. If you want to play golf on your handheld get another system. But if you're looking for an organizer that is expandable (plays mp3s), stores digital photos, has a USB port for lightning fast downloads, and can manage your time you've found the right one. If you have a lot of money get an iPaq otherwise for the value you can't beat the Cassiopeia. The WinCE 3.0 might limit available software but how much can you pack on a handheld? With pocket PC2002 just around the corner any unit you buy will be old in 3 months. (...)"
1,"Okay for the money, but it's too restrictive","At first, I loved it. But I slowly discovered that the daily planner was not very customizable.1) You can't choose the color of the fonts in the planner(they are pre-determined) and some of them are too faint to see.2)It automatically scrolls down your appointments, and there is no way to turn this feature off.3) You can't download just any Windows CE software...It only accepts Casio software.3) It's slow.4) There doesn't seem to be any way to jump to different dates. You can only jump to today's date.5) I miss the ""find"" feature that palm OS machines have."
3,"BE-300, It was a GOOD one, until.......","It was a GOOD one until I tried to buy a new battery for it. It took me a week to get ahold of someone at Casio to order a battery. When I finally did, it was on backorder. They refered me to another supplier that gets them from Casio. When I asked ""how much?"" they said $63 plus freight ($71 total). I decided that was too much. I only paid $140 for my BE-300 new. I have checked online for other sources and no luck. So, off to the ""electronics bone pile"" it will go...."
2,Not for medical people,"The color and graphics are great - however the only software you can use - is that made for the BE-300 strictly. Windows CE based software with not work, at least I haven't found the trick yet. I bought the BE-300, thinking it would work for my medical software - boy I was wrong. Now I strictly use the BE-300 for addresses and to play games. I contacted Cassio via email several times and never received a reply to any of my questions I think there's a Handspring or Palm in my near future. If anyone has some helpful suggestions - please post them."
5,If Amazon reviewed this correctly it would be OUT OF STOCK,"This inexpensive PDA is about as versatile as they come Mobipocket Ebooks (including tons or refernce works), Audible Audiobooks (Audible.com), news and mp3 content from Mycasio.com --- expandible memory via Compact Flash cards or IBM Microdrive, Personal Information Manager software, gamescan synch with MSOutlook, can hook up to a portable keyboard and on and on and on. The tech info that says not Audible compatible is WRONG. It is. There is some 3rd party software available and they permit a ""skinnable"" menu interface i.e. XPOD KCmenuII and soon a very small Linux - you can create whatever look you want. Caveat - dont attempt using two different PDAs (USB) off the same computer. The PC software gets confused and wont link the 2nd PDA. (Bummer) This baby is A) not so spendy and B) versatile if you check out your options."
2,Good for Basics,"This is a good little starter PDA. If you want to JUST take down addresses and keep track of a calendar. I had a horrible time syncing with Office. PC Connect is really bad. As for software. Good luck. There are some bulletin boards on the net to get software, but there is a VERY limited supply of software. Most programs do not work. Even the CE programs. Casio sells you something that is barely able to be supported. My advice, save your money a while longer and get something you will enjoy."
5,The Best Book,"Jean S. writes so wonderfully. You just love how she writes: ""The chestnut struck with so much power and force it was beautiful to see."" Also, she would never write about Mindy saddling her beautiful black stallion and winning a race bareback. Shes all real. I have read the Monday Horses every night for the past year. That means I have read it about 365 times!!!!!"
3,Took it off my wish list,"Too many negative reviews on this product - removed it from my wishlist. Not interested in someone paying $70 for a product that likely will stop working just after the warranty expired. I went with Cuisinart - better products, 3 year warranty, vs. a 1 year from KA.Good luck if you buy it."
1,beater broker after a couple of uses,"UPDATE: After exactly one year and one day, from purchase, one of the beaters broke again. This time, the cheap wires simply sheared from the shaft while wife was making chocolate chip cookies. Luckily, KitchenAid sent me a new set, but it took almost three weeks, we had to use the wisk attachment until then. I'm surprised others haven't experienced this more often.---------------------------------------------------------------Disappointing that the beaters are so cheaply made. The wisk end is press fit into the shaft. The beater was already loose when I recieved the mixer. I can only hope that this was done intentionally to prevent damage to the mixer.Fortunately, my workplace has the ability to do stainless steel welding. I'm going to ask for a replacement set and sell them on Ebay. The demand is going to be high for them!"
2,Worked great for a year then Kaput!,"We have had this mixer for 1 year and 3 months, and only use it 2-3 times a month. It worked great and we loved it, but one day it just would not turn on. It's dead."
1,Not enough power/Didn't last,"I have two KitchenAid STAND mixers that I like very much, but the KitchenAid HAND mixer was the worst I have ever bought. The power was much less than expected and even though I used it for light mixing (whipped cream, etc.) it lasted only six months."
5,Exactly what we expected.,A hand mixer with more power and more settings than most would need....which means it can do everythingyou could want and not be strained and short-lived. We have the Pro counter top mixer....this is itsnatural counter part.
2,digital problems,"I bought this a few yrs. ago & absolutly loved it. It really did a great job of mixing. One day out of the blue it was dead!. I suspect it was the digital. I really loved it, but it died just after the warantee was up. (of course) I won't buy another one. Went back to my old Black & decker which works great, but very rough. (throws the stuff around at low speed.)"
1,Piece of junk,"Although I've had this mixer for 4 years, I probably used it a grand total of 6 times. The mixer is like new. I bought it to replace my mother's 60 year old mixer, thinking it would be much more convenient to use. We recently had several people over for a get together and in the morning I brought out the mixer to make some frosting for cupcakes. The mixer would not turn on. It was completely dead. Fortunately, I still have my mother's 60 year old mixer (it probably weighs 20 lbs!), so I dragged it out and made the frosting without a problem. They just don't make things like they use to!"
1,Stopped working,"I bought this mixer over a year ago, and it has stopped working. Like others, it makes this clicking noise. I think that there is a loose wire. Everyone once in a while I can get it to work again, but it takes multiple trials. Way too pricey, and did not last. I think there is a manufacturer's defect as multiple people have complained of the ""clicking"" problem and not being able to turn it on. Don't waste your money. There are other brands that will last longer."
5,Kitchenaid 9 speed mixer,"I ordered this hand held mixer in lieu of one of Kitchenaids big mixers and it turns out I was right to do so. The mixer is rather powerful and can churn through heavy doughs quite well. The best part is that its relatively compact and is much more versatile than the big mixer without spending hundreds of dollars. Perhaps when I'm making really large recipes, the big mixer would be better, but for now the hand held is awesome and I am very happy with it. As far as durability goes, well time will tell, but for now its working flawlessly."
5,Just Right,"Couldn't be happier with this product. I almost balked at spending over $70 on a hand mixer, but since I tried it, I'm glad I did. Life's too short for cheap, noisy ""disposable"" big-box mixers."
2,Fix for 'dead' kitchenaid hand mixers,"For those of us with 'dead' kitchenaid hand mixers...It seems that these mixers all seem to die after sitting unused for some amount of time. Mine probably sat in the box almost a year. Unbox it, plug in, and nothing. The symptom is that after plugging in, then pressing 'on' button, get a small click inside but no display.Here's what I did that got it working again.Plug it in and wait. a few hours was not enough to get mine working, it took several hours (overnight). In the morning, press the on button, and got the flashing '0' in the display. Press again, and the darn thing started turning.I wonder how many of these 'dead' mixers are sitting in landfills that could be restored. Mine almost was.Credit to the other opinions here that led me to try 'recharging' it before tossing it, although it took much longer."
3,Not as good as it used to be....,"After 20+ years, my old KitchenAid Hand Mixer was just worn out. The mixers would not stay in. So I bought this one thinking it would be EXACTLY like my last 9-speed Professional Hand Mixer, and I am a bit disappointed with the speed. The highest speed (9) is equivolent to the speed of 5 on the old mixer. I guess the saying is true......they just don't make things like the used to! Overall, the mixer is good, but the speed needs to be better, especially for the price.(And this was the second mixer I purchased, because the 7 speed was even slower!)"
2,Totally dead after less than 10 times used.,It is 3 years old but has not been used very much at all. Kitchen aid products are usually great but not this one. It worked last time I used it and pulled out on Father's Day and not anything...it was as if it had no power but it did...just does not work.
3,Buyer beware,"I bought this KitchenAid 9 speed mixer and really didn't look at anything else as I have one of the large stand mixers and consider it the caddy of mixers. I used the mixer less than 4 minutes and one of the beaters actually fell apart! I was making chocolate chip cookies - hardly the batter to break a beater. I believe the actual mixer/motor is probably the greatest however the beaters are flimsy. The KitchenAid people replaced them right away. Now I have my doubts as to whether these beaters will hold up. The little cheap $9.99 model of hand mixer I had before lasted me over 20 years. I wonder how long this one will last? My advice would be to check out the other hand mixers. If they all have this type beater then KitchenAid is probably a fine choice if for nothing else than the motor (it would probably last forever). When I checked, replacement beaters were around $15."
5,Love this mixer!,"Great item...I just love the flat surface on the back end of the mixer for standing, the quiet motor, but above all the power of this mixer. I don't have the counterspace for the large stand mixer and this is its perfect little sister. I didn't think I would use all the nine speeds or in fact needed them....but I find myself adjusting all the time, with ease I might add, based on the consistency of the dough or mix. Love it!"
5,Kitchen Aid hand mixer,If you aren't a professional baker or make large batches of things...this hand mixer is fantastic. Buy the bowls -- they allow you to rest the mixer on the sides.
1,Cheap beaters broke!!!,I only used this mixer a few times to mix a cake and the cheap wire beaters broke. It was just barely a year after ordering from Amazon. I called KitchenAid and they wanted all my paperwork which I sent. After that I never heard from them again. I am much happier with the $10.00 Hamilton Beach mixer I bought from Walmart for my RV. I got lots more use out of it.
1,Randomly stopped working,"Like many other reviewers, my hand mixer has randomly stopped working after some time in the cabinet. I am very unhappy with the quality of this product."
1,Bought the Name But Didn't Get the Quality,"Let me just add my sad story to the ones already on the list. Bought what I thought would be a quality product. Went ahead and paid the extra bucks, but the KitchenAid ""Professional"" Hand Mixer gave up the ghost after about a dozen rather light and infrequent uses. Does not run, and same ""clicking"" noise that many others have also described. Too bad it was just out of warranty. It seems very obvious to me in reading the rest of these one-star reviews, that there is a serious design or manufacturing issue with this product, so buyer, be warned. Apparently KitchenAid isn't the same quality brand it used to be."
1,digital failure,This mixer failed just after the warranty ended. For the price of this mixer I am very dissapointed in the longevity. It was not used very much even in the 1 1/2 years. I now am going to purchase a non-digital mixer. I would discourage people from purchasing this mixer.
1,Just Stopped Working!,"I bought this hand mixer in 2006 and in that space of time used it maybe 20 times. I went to turn it on today and nothing. When I click the on button I hear a little ""jump"" from the motor, but the beaters don't turn and the digital display is blank. I have not abused the mixer in any way.With that said, when it worked it seemed worth the money. It was nicely made, came with well designed beaters (and a wisk), and had a nice digital display.My KitchenAid food processor and blender, which I bought at the same time, have worked well, so this hand mixer is a disappointment.All in all... if it didn't break, it was great."
5,Built like a tank,"I love my mixer. It can do all sorts of heavy mixing that most of my other hand mixers have not been able to do. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and performs perfectly."
5,Great little mixer,"I had a hand mixer that probably qualified to be almost an antique! When it was time to put that one to rest, I chose this model above the others available. It is a sturdy mixer with a range of several speeds from which to choose. The attachments are easily secured to the mixer. Ergonomically, it is comfortable to hold while mixing. Clean-up is easy as the attachements pop out; the exterior of the mixer is also easy to wipe clean. Great gift for others or for yourself!"
5,Awesome mixer!,"My 35 year old Sunbeam stand mixer needed to be replaced. I thought about getting a stand KitchenAid Artisan, but those are rather expensive, and I would need to get a hand mixer in addition to that. So I thought I'd try this 9 speed hand mixer and see if I still needed to get the big Artisan. This one works great, and does everything I need it to. This turns out to be the only mixer I need! I have used it for cakes, beating eggs, mashed potatoes, and much more. And the price is GREAT--I checked around a lot, and this is by far the best price I found."
5,You Can't beat KitchenAid!,"This is my third KitchenAid hand mixer. My first was a three speed, my second a five speed and now I have the nine speed. Each one has had more power than the last. This is light weight and has an easy to use digital speed control that is not in your way when you are using the mixer. I always wanted the KitchenAid stand mixer, but when my children were home, I couldn't afford it and now that I can afford it, the hand mixers from KitchenAid have made me realize its just not necessary to have the big one that takes up a lot of counter space. The nine speed is wonderful. The lower two speeds are for stirring. My other two mixers didn't have that capability. I was surprised how much power this mixer has. If you don't have the room or don't want to spend the money to buy a big stand mixer, buy this one. It's a great little mixer with a lot of power."
2,Somewhat disappointed with quality of this mixer!,"I purchased this mixer from Amazon.com in March of 2008, and after mixing a few batches of cookie dough, the beaters are clicking and wobbly. Although it's nice having the 9 speeds (easy to turn up the speed or turn the mixer off), the beater problem is simply poor quality and I expected better from KitchenAid. I've always loved my KitchenAid 6-qt. mixer, so when I noticed this 9-Speed Hand Mixer, I didn't hesitate to purchase it. I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend it -- for the same money or less, there are much better mixers available (read the excellent reviews for the Oster products)."
2,Great! Until it QUIT!,"As others have mentioned. Mine worked perfectly for about a year. Then just wouldn't turn on - seemed like an electronic short. I thought my toddler had gotten to it a few too many times, until I read so many similar reviews. I really loved it while it worked, did so many things perfectly!"
1,"KitchenAid KHM9PWH 9-Speed Professional Hand Mixer, White","KitchenAid KHM9PWH 9-Speed Professional Hand Mixer, WhitePiece of Junk, Turns on for a few seconds. I tried to change the speed settings It flips on and off. Then the speed light arrow jumps from 4 to 7 then 9, while the beaters turn like its set on one. The settings are messed up. I'm Done with kitchenaid. Very Poor, and Rude Customer Service. I want a company I can count on if I'm buying their products. Kitchenaid is aware theirs a problem with this hand mixer and they continue to sell them. No Quality Here. Zero Stars."
4,Great Product!,This product was ordered and was shipped in a timely fashion. It works well and the nine speeds are great! We also enjoy the whisp that came with the mixer.
3,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I bought this for my wife. I was expecting a whiz-bang item that would do every amazing thing you could think of. Out of the box it was really just another Chinese appliance. Ho hum. For those of you who have been mesmerized by the 'Kitchenaid' label, take note: Most of their kitchen utensils are made in China. This may not mean they are of poor quality, just that they are overpriced. If you want to pay more because the label says 'Kitchenaid', be my guest. This mixer is another example. It is a good mixer, but there are many other good hand mixers out there, some for under $10. Is this one worth $70? All the reviewers who loved this item have convinced themselves that it is. Will a $10 mixer do the job? Sure it will. Who knows, this may even have been made in the same factory as the cheapies! If it didn't say 'Kitchenaid' it would probably sell for less than half of what the 'Kitchenaid"" does. I'd advise you to shop around a bit before spending big bucks for this."
2,beater breaks after 18 months,"I enjoyed using the 9-speed mixer until last night when one of the beaters separated from its spindle. The whisk end simply fell off the metal rod while mixing cookie dough. It cannot be fixed, and KitchenAid made no offer to replace this obviously defective part because the warranty had expired. I was forced to purchase another pair of beaters for $15 plus shipping. KitchenAid markets and prices itself as a high-end appliance manufacturer; one should not have to replace the beaters after only about 10 uses in 18 months."
1,Unsatisfied Very disappointed,I received this as a gift for Christmas in 2008. It will not start. They only have a one year warrenty. I have not used it that much maybe every other month to whip cream -- never on anything tough like cookies. I will not buy another Kitchen Aide because when I bought it I thought this would be the last one I need so I could justify the expense. Now I will buy a cheap model like the one that was still working when I replaced it!
2,Died after 2 years with light use,It worked great and I loved everything about this quiet powerful little machine good for about 18 months with light use. One day it wouldn't start no matter what I tried so I put it away. A week later I tried again and it worked. This crazy machine worked one out of 20 times and it has let me down today when I really needed to whip up some cream for my party so I threw it out finally. I should have tossed it sooner and replaced with a cheaper one from Target like my last one lasted for several years until I decided to upgrade and discard the old faithful work horse nothing was wrong. It taught me a lesson that something costs more does not mean it is better. A piece of junk.
1,Piece of junk!!!!,I bought 2 of these mixers ~ 3 years ago. One for myself and a friend. I dont' use mine very much and she doesn't either. Both the switches went out on ours. Mine went out about 6 months ago and hers just went out. Motor wont' turn on - all it does is click. Before this I had an $8 GE mixer that lasted for over 30 years. This Kitchen Aide worked great at first... but once it stops you are out of luck. All the company wanted to do was sell me another. NOT IN MY LIFETIME!!
1,Failed after light use,"I bought the kitchen aid hand mixer for my wife, who used it infrequently for over about two years. Recently it would not start, a problem shown by several other reviewers. Poor quality, poor reliability. I don't recommend purchasing this item."
1,Stopped working after only about 6 times,"I bought this hand-held mixer December 2005 and by the January 2007 it had stopped working. Mind you I only use it once every 6 months or so. Therefore, I maybe got at most about 5 uses out of it before it would only go from power level 1 and then back to 0. It would just fluctuate between the off and 1 no matter how much it was pushed. So it was totally useless. Since the warranty is only one year I have spent $54.88 for absolutely nothing.When I called KitchenAid, their service rep said he could do nothing but sell me another one at a cheaper price. Thank you, but ""no thank you""."
1,Buyer PLEASE beware!,Purchased and recd alittle less than 3 mos. ago from Warehouse Deals. Mixer is broken after 3 times of use. Should have known better. Might be better to purchase a brand new one than a refurbished or returned item. Remember the motto - BUYER BEWARE.............
2,beware,"Be careful of buying KitchenAid products here. I bought this mixer, and the only reason I considered spending this much for a hand mixer is because of the name. My mixer was ok, while not good enough to justify the high price. I thought I could at least count on it lasting. I was wrong. Two weeks after the one year warranty was up, one of the beaters broke while making mashed potatoes. Before realizing it was past the warranty date, I called Kitchen Aid and was told that Amazon is ""like E-Bay,"" selling used items. I assured them that I paid for a new product!So now I learned. Just buy the cheaper mixers, and realize ""throw away"" culture makes it too costly to try to alter this reality! It got worse... i was told that the warranty I had was expired, and months after this whole incident, they actually had the NERVE to send me something to tell me the warranty was about to expire, and I shouldn't take a chance, should pay them more to extend the warranty they refused to acknowledge!"
4,Nice Mixer,"I purchased this after my braun mixer was dropped and they no longer make them. I read all the reviews and thought this would be a good buy. I like the slow speeds so things don't splatter all over before they mix up. I would buy this again. My only disappointment is that it doesn't come with attachments, but I knew that going in. You'll be pleased with this product."
4,Good hand mixer,"I purchased this when my 11 year old Cuisinart hand mixer unexpectedly died on me in the middle of making a cake. I was attracted to this one because of the 9 speeds and because the other reviews were favorable (plus, Amazon offered a good price). I did not like my old one (was given to me as a wedding shower gift, so I did not pick it out) because the slowest speed was still quite fast and often caused liquids to splash out of the bowl. This mixer doesn't seem to have that problem and I really like that aspect of it. However, on the flip side, the highest speed doesn't seem to be as fast as my old one. Maybe I just need to adjust to it, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to go as fast as I thought it should. There seems to be little incremental difference between each speed. Overall, I am happy with it."
1,More Junk from China,"I used my KitchenAid hand mixer lightly, perhaps once every 3 months. By the time it was 2 years old, it was dead. I owned a ""made in USA"" Sunbeam hand mixer for 30 years, and thought I'd treat myself by getting a new, powerful KitchenAid hand mixer. As it turns out, whoever bought my old one at Goodwill is the one who got the deal; the 35 year old Sunbeam, I'm sure, is still working, and the 2 year old KitchenAid is destined for the landfill. Why would that be? The answer is simple: ""Made in China."""
1,Good While It Last!!,"I purchased this mixer not quite 2 years ago, loved it but don't use a mixer much. Put it in the cabinet after a fewuses and low and behold take it out now and NOTHING!!!! It's totally dead! The use on this can be counted on one hand, I wanted to have it around for those few times I needed it. Well, now no warrantee and no mixer, it's an expensive purchase when you divide the purchase price by 5!!"
1,Very Dissapointed,"I thought KitchenAid was a good brand. This mixer worked great.. 3 times. Then it stopped working. Just doesn't even turn on. I don't bake much, so for the ONE year that I had it, it was mostly sitting in a drawer. Of course the warrentee is up now. It's only one year. It really sad when a $10, Betty Crocker hand mixer lasts 20+ years and when it finally gives out, the $80 KITCHENAID replacement turns out to be garbage.I've bought a $30 Kenmore to replace the Kitchenaid now. At least it has a 2 year warrentee.I won't ever buy Kitchenaid again."
1,Dead Dud,Purchased a couple of years ago. Used maybe twice. Took it out to use today and it won't turn on. DO NOT PURCHASE this mixer....it is a complete waste of money! Look at the numerous other reviewers who have had the same problem.
1,terrible beaters,"I don't understand why everyone things KitchenAid is so great. After having a Sunbeam hand mixer for 25 years, I paid top dollar for the KitchenAid and the beaters are awful. When making whipped potatoes, it won't get rid of the lumps. Same for crepes (NO, crepes are not supposed to have lumps). I ended up giving it away and buying a cheaper mixer that works great. Also, I'm not impressed with my $400.00 stand mixer either. It has the bowl lift feature (like the Pros-ha-ha)which actually shakes when you turn it on. Even Alton Brown mentioned that. Also, the bowl lift makes it difficult to add ingredients. Unfortunately, that costs too much so I'm stuck with it."
3,Mis-Leading,"Just a heads-up for any who are concerned about where products are made - the description indicates that this is made in USA, however, the product is labeled made in China. I did not test the mixer so I am not commenting on the quality of the mixer but the program will not allow a review with ""blank"" stars."
2,Greater Expectations,1.It seems that there is slight vibration from beaters.2.The top speed is not as good as my old $9.95 mixer.
1,Not Delivered,"I purchased this mixer (very good mixer from my previous experience) along with another item. The other item was delivered in a timely fashion without any problems. I was notified the mixer was ""undeliverable"" to my home, to which many other Amazon items (including the one ordered at the same time as the mixer) had been delivered in the past without any problems whatsoever. Because of this, the sale was lost, as I ordered the mixer from another source. Very frustrating experience, calls into question Amazon's delivery system."
5,Great Mixer!,"I was a littel worried about the beaters until I tried it. (They are round, not flat-bladed.) This mixer is great! The multiple speeds offer great control. It also handles heavy batters."
2,Beater wire broke after one year!! $22 to replace!,"Short on countertop space but wanting a strong beater for choc chip cookie dough, I sprang for the 9-speed professional model. Motor hangs tough, but how disappointed I was that the wire turbobeater broke in less than 2 years of very occasional use--mostly thin cake mixes, some choc chip cookie batter. Not sure if weld broke or metal snapped but beaters should last at least a decade. Never had beaters break on a GE or Sunbeam or other value brand. Kitchenaid wants more for shipping new beaters than it would cost to buy new of other brand. I swear I still have indestructable beaters laying around kitchen since the 1970s! Shame on Kitchenaid for flimsy beaters!! Won't invest like that again!"
1,Bad Batch??,"This was highly recommended by Cooks Illustrated but I am not very happy with its performance. Not very powerful and second beaters, the thinner ones, broke after a few months! Will not buy this particular model again."
4,"Good Value, Reputation, & Performance","I purchased this mixer back in the summer when they offered a rebate with it. [Note: Rebate took quite a while to receive; it was from KA and not from Amazon] Upon first receiving the unit, I have to admit that I did not use it often. Believe it or not, it was not until after I purchased the stand mixer than I began to utilize the hand mixer for smaller jobs. While I have not used it for extended jobs its mixing function is great and the speed options are great. As far as durability, only time will tell.I am NOT a fan that its MIC (Made in China) but the price, value along with the rebate, and reputation made it a easy choice."
4,Excellent hand mixer,"I enjoyed this mixer so much, I sent another one as a gift to a relative.I especially appreciate the whisk that comes with the 9 speed hand mixer. It whips egg whites and heavy cream in a flash.Thanks,EveKitchenAid KHM9PWH 9-Speed Professional Hand Mixer, White"
1,Poor quality.,"I bought this for my wife last Mother's Day and after less than 10 uses, it fails to power on. Looks like I'm not the only one after reading these reviews...buyer beware."
4,Quality Product,"I found the product to be well built.The only negative that I have is that the beaters are wire, which gives you the impression that they are cheap.I don't care to much for electronic start on appliances, but that's just me. Some people love it. You have to run it up to speed, and back it down, and it takes too much time for me.I like powerful motors, manual controls, and built like a tank, kind of like Tim the Tool Man."
1,Works Until It Doesn't,"This was an enjoyable appliance when it worked, and I was quite pleased with it until a couple months ago when it just wouldn't turn on. I'm not a big baker so it was used very lightly. I purchased it only a little over a year ago and it is already dead. Fortunately my American Express extends the warranty by a year so I'm able to get a refund. My old cruddy 3-speed $15 hand mixer lasted for years and years - 10+ years. I'm disappointed in this KitchenAid product - so much for KitchenAid quality."
1,Get the warranty,"I wish I could give this a no star rating. When I got this mixer I loved it! It was quiet and efficient. But I had it for a little more than a year and rarely at that. I probably didn't use it 5 times total. Now it's dead and just refuses to turn on. I should have paid attention to the reivews when I bought it but I didn't, now I'm stuck and the company refuses to do anything. The one I had previous to this one was not even a major brand I picked up at the local Wal-Mart for about $10. It lasted for about 15 years."
5,more than expected,"I like to bake but have limited storage space and needed a dependable hand mixer. This model is quiet, strong, and easy to hold. The beaters detach easily and go in the dishwasher. I am mixing many of my favorite recipes effortlessly now. I would certainly recommend this mixer without reservation."
5,KitchenAid KHM9PWH 9-Speed Professional Hand Mixer,"Lightweight, Plenty Powerful and a pleasure to handle, there is not much more you can ask from this hand-mixer. These features combined with Amazon's outstanding customer service and pricing, make it an all around rewarding experience."
1,Splatter,"I bake about once a week and bought this because my old Oster hand mixer burned out after more than 10 years. Was very excited after reading all the great reviews. I was so shocked when I used it the first time - cake batter splattered out of the bowl! Never encountered this problem before. Had to transfer batter into a deeper bowl. Then had another shock when I used the whisk to whip up cream - cream splattered all over my counter! And yes, I did start on low and slowly cranked it up. Am returning it."
4,Mixer,"Mixer is what I expected, but actually like the mixer I had before better with just 3 speeds. I find it a little more of a pain to use the push buttons to increase speed rather than a pushable sliding switch. Also hard to truly find a real medium speed which is what a lot of recipes ask for. Otherwise it works great and I can use my old beaters in it from the old Kitchenaid mixer that I replaced with this one, so that's great!"
2,Poor blades,"I have used this mixer for 5 years or so. I works fine, lots of power and reliable, good for most applications. BUT the wire blades do not do mashed potatoes properly. Doing mashed potatoes with a mixer needs some amount of cutting action to tear up the potatoes. The smooth round stainless wire blades do not break down the potatoes at all. I've tried dozens of times, adding liquid, a dryer mix, more cooking time etc. Always a lumpy mess of mashed potatoes. OTOH our previous cheap mixer and cheap sheet metal blades the potatoes whip up quickly, and the lumps are broken down fast. Its kind of obvious that the engineer designing this unit never tried to use it. I'd like to see an additional set of alternate mashing blades then it would be a 5 star."
2,Fantastic series; atrocious print quality,"I've read through the Aubrey-Maturin series before, and it is without a doubt my favorite series of book. This is the first hardcover of them that I have purchased: I intended to start my own collection rather than check them out from the library.I use the past tense because, instead of being a quality hardcover, the Norton hardcover edition that I purchased is of poorer print quality than an average paperback. The words are fuzzy and indistinct: it looks as though it were printed at draft quality on a circa 1995 printer. The poor contrast provided by the subpar paper further hinders readability.I'm afraid that I must recommend PO'B fans to search elsewhere--perhaps a used bookstore--to obtain this excellent series. It is a shame that excellence of O'Brian's writing is not matched by its presentation in this hardcover edition."
1,Bad Link in Other Format Box,"CAUTION!!! IF YOU SELECT THE MP3 FORMAT FROM THIS PAGE IT TAKES YOU TO ""HMS SURPRISE""!!! DO NOT USE THIS LINK OR YOU WILL GET THE WRONG BOOK!!"
4,Patrick O'Brian as good as ever,"Once again Patrick O'Brian at his very best, This book is best read as part of the Aubrey/maturin adventures, This book is fourth in the series, of 21 books, I have grown to enjoy his style of writeing, his attention to detail of the running of a naval ship at the turn of the 1800's the life on board, the detail of life as it was, the social, you get very involved in their lives. This series of adventures, is the best I have come across and patrick O'Brian, pens it to perfection"
5,Superb Action Thriller,"Based on the eight O'Brian Aubrey-Maturin books I've read so far, Mauritius Command has the most military excitement. Jack Aubrey's skills as a military strategist are put to a test- author O'Brian tutors the reader on naval strategy during that last great era of fighting ships of sail. Splendid!"
5,I love this stuff!,"Going gluten free, I was looking for pasta I could eat. This pasta is absolutely wonderful! I love that I can purchase it through Amazon.com with free shipping and no taxes. HOORAY!"
5,My favorite,"I use Tinkyada spirals the most when making our weekly pasta dinner, they're just so much fun. These work great for pasta dinners or cold pasta salads with lots of veggies and feta.Tinkyada products hold up perfectly to cooking and aren't soggy and mealy like the other gluten free brands out there. This is worth buying and you won't be sorry!"
4,A tad too big for the plate,"Well made, good look to them, only issue I have is that they are a bit to thick at the sides. It covers up the expiration month and year (VA tags) So far no cops have bothered me. Worse case scenario I remove them. Anything is better than those cheap plastic ones, or worse, dealer frames..."
1,Very Poorly Printed - NOT What I Expected,"The text contained in the book is well written and interesting. The pictures however, are VERY poorly printed / reproduced. The books binding is also less that stellar...* * * I CANNOT RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK * * *"
4,Good Book with many mistakes,"This is a great book for beginning PLC programmers, but there are numerouse errors throughout the book which cause confusion when trying to understand the use of Internal Relays, Timers and Counters. Use caution and refer back to the text when completing the tests at the end of each section and when reading about how some ladder logic is functioning, I noticed miss-labled Inputs."
2,Do not buy this book if youre programming STL,"I did not get any benefits of this book, sadly.It is useless with Siemens S7 and you want to learn the STL language.To few examples with this language.Sorry"
5,Grief video for children,"Diane Crandall, a teacher of 33 years, did a great job presenting a difficult subject with such sensitivity."
3,"Great, except the pusher in the picture was not included.","The grinder and vegetable strainer work great. The package was delivered on time, as expected. Would have given it 5 stars, except the food pusher that was included in the package was NOT the nice solid wood pusher shown in the picture. It is a plastic pusher, not solid. Works fine until you try to process ground meat a 2nd time, making sausage, or trying to use the sausage stuffer. The ground meat comes up the grooves in the pusher, it's a mess. My old grinder (another brand) had a solid pusher, I did not have these problems. I read on a review that you can contact KitchenAid and request a different pusher. Hopefully they will send a solid one, otherwise I will be spending about $15.00 for a solid one. Amazon should update the picture, it is sadly misleading."
5,Worth Every Penny,"This attachment made making tomato sauce a snap. With our first batch of tomatoes, my husband and I peeled them the traditional way by boiling and then putting them in cold water. Once we got this attachment, we haven't looked back. It completely eliminates the boiling/peeling process to get tomato sauce. Simply clean, slice and grind. Voila! Perfectly smooth tomato sauce comes out the other end - and quickly. We are so glad we purchased this."
4,Very useful attachment,"I found this item, very handy and useful. Makes my chores easier especially when I have to finish work in a jiffy."
2,"Works great for soft foods, plastic too flimsy for anything else. Top tray is small though.","This thing works great for applesauce; cooked apple quarters or halves in one end, applesauce out the middle, and cores/stems/peels out the end. We cook the apples in 9x13 pans, 1 in the microwave and two in the oven, and still can't keep up with the strainer. I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about with a cross-shaped food pusher. Ours is a wooden pusher like in the photo. The top tray is a little small but not too big a deal for apples anyway.Found out the hard way that the plastic parts are no match for bread crumbs. Had the bread cubes totally dried out as per the instruction manual, after a while started noticing white flecks in the crumbs coming out. Turns out that dried bread cubes are harder than the plastic and had been destroying the thing by grinding the plastic off."
5,First Class,"Bought this item to make homemade tomato sauce with the food strainer and sausage with the meat grinder. Both products didn't disappoint. In fact, we liked the meat grinder so much we now grind fresh turkey and chicken etc.Well worth the money and easy to clean, a lot easier than I thought. BTW, just picked up the book ""from the ground up"" by James Villas, a book containing hundreds a recipes for freshly ground meats and fish. Yes fish, can't wait to try the ground shrimp dishes."
5,NO Waste,This was awesome. We had over 300lbs of apples and made applesauce. This made life so much easier. We did run the pulp through a second time because it was a little moist still (I hate waste) but the small amount that was left was minimal (which was used to feed the chickens). Get the oversided tray for the top (feeder) I can't imagine doing this job without the big tray.
5,Great Product,I just used this to turn tomoatoes into pizza sauce. It worked great. I do wish that the package came with a wooden pusher so I wouldn't have to use something else to shove the tomatoes down into the grinder.
5,A must have if you can applesauce or baby food,"I thought this was a bit pricey just for making applesauce, but once I used it, I was convinced otherwise. The tedious peeling and making sure every seed was out is gone. Just use a simple corer slicer, cook and put through the sieve. It takes out all the peels and hard pieces and dumps them into a separate bowl. My kids hate chunky applesauce and this was the equipment that eliminated chunks. If I had this when they were babies, they would not have eaten canned baby food - makes easy work of pureed baby food. I have not used for meat grinding, but that attachment is also included. The piece on the top that you put your food in is a bit small, I would like to have had a bigger basin, but I think they are actually available to purchase separately."
3,OK quality.,"However, this stuff is WAY too expensive for what you get. Wish someone would make a knock-off on these kitchenaid accessories."
3,If You're Only Making Applesauce,"If you're only making applesauce, this is a 5-star product. If you had other uses in mind, keep reading:I thought this would replace the need for a food mill. Not quite. This would be better if you could vary the size of the holes in the screen. I don't like it for tomato sauce; the juice was too thin. I do use it when making spinach lasagna to get all of the water out of the spinach (the spinach is really bone dry when I'm done, which was what I wanted.)"
1,Will not work with blackberries!,"I purchased the grinder/strainer combination so I could make blackberry jam easily. I read through the instruction booklet to be sure I was doing it correctly. It started out fine, but then the strainer got clogged with seeds,and the strainer burst apart at the seams.Kitchen Aid help line person was very good and said they would send me a new part. When I asked what I could do so it wouldn't happen again, she looked up on their troubleshooting site. On the site, it warned against using large seeded-fruit such as blackberries. Had this been mentioned in their instruction booklet, I would have returned the item unused and gotten my money back. As it is now, I'll try to sell it and recoup part of my purchase price."
3,Kitchen Aid strainer/food grinder,"I bought this grinder to make baby food and it doesn't do the job that a standard blender would do. I have only used it twice in the past 3 months and would not recommend it to anyone using it for that purpose. This is a pretty good deal if you need something to just chop/grind up food, or for juice. SocialMommie"
5,works great what more can you ask?,"did my yard and really needed this product to help in the corners. Have more thanI need, however, at the price it was insignificant. I may use more of what I haveleft over later.good product, easy to use. works as it shouldhighly recomment."
2,disappointed,"The dress material is not good, polyester, and cheap even though it looks good online. In addition the vendor is in China. This means you have to be careful with your cost of returning the item because of custom. The process is a pain. I was very disappointed. I believe they should disclose that the item is being shipped from out of the United States and you might possibly encounter additional cost."
2,See-Thru Evening Dress......,"Beautiful dress design but poor quality material. Dress is extremely see-thru. You would need to have a full linning sewn onto the dress in order to wear it without looking totatlly naked. Even if you wear undergarments, (bra, slip etc.) the white areas of the dress are so see-thru that everything you wear underneath will show through unless you have it properly sewn onto the dress.Black/White Sexy Long Formal Evening Gown Dress"
4,Beginner to Salsa,"I am a beginner in salsa dance, and this DVD was my first purchase of a salsa DVD. I love it! The moves are a challenge, it keeps my heart rate up, and watching her and her dancers really inspire me to dance! I can only hope she'll come out with another DVD of more salsa moves. And I do appreciate the breakdown of all the moves. Now, I just have to work on getting them down!"
3,"Could have been great, but it's barely good","The cueing on this DVD is simply awful. It's a perfect example of how NOT to cue on an exercise DVD. She does not explain the moves well at all and in some cases, the camera is fixed on the upper body when she is teaching a move (which she barely does). How is that helpful?After the DVD ends, there is an instructional to learn the somewhat complex moves. Question: Wouldn't that have made more sense at the beginning of the DVD or at least available on the opening menu? It's like a secret at the end. Dumb.Additionally, the cool down and the warm up are exactly the same. Total lack of imagination. Otherwise, it was somewhat fun. Not great, but really could have been if someone applied common sense."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting a lot of moving, not repetition of complicated steps. I used to teach beginning ballroon dancing and this was even complicated for me. Salsa dancing can be very cardio, but the ""somewhat"" cardio section was very short. If you're looking for a workout this is not the video for you."
1,Not Salsa - Lisa teaches Mambo,Do not buy this or any of Lisa' videos if you are looking for Salsa. This is a slick marketing product to sell an exercise video in which she is not dancing Salsa but rather dancing Mambo....and very poorly at that. If you are looking to exercise to Salsa you will be confused.....If you are looking to learn Salsa you will not learn it.
1,not teaching,This video doesn't teach you how to salsa. It is very fast passed. I think if you had some salsa background you'd be fine. But for beginners..no. I really wanted something that taught the steps and then put them together. This just does the steps and you need to catch on. I will say it works up a good sweat.
1,Noisy,I got this for my Toyota land cruiser this muffler makes it so much more noisier. It also does not look very good.
1,An Alternative,"If you are interested in savoring the Dhammapada I suggest you get the recent translation by Glenn Wallis. It is both skillful and engaging. It also includes a guide to reading the text. I believe Ms. Larkin's version is a bit too watered down.For example, in Wallis's version in the first chapter he translates a section as follows:Some do not understandthat we are perishing here.Those who understand thisbring to rest their quarrels.As far as I can figure out, Ms. Larkin has this same section as follows:So many people fail to realize thatin quarrelingwe ourselves are destroyed.Those who recognizethis truthrestrain their quarrels.Personally I find Wallis's (who has a Ph.D. in Sanskrit and Indian Studies from Harvard) translation much richer yet still very accessible."
1,Weep for our good friend Bob...,"I don't know what happened here, but I think it went something like this: Bob gets approached by the team that made Cher's ""Believe"" album and somehow convince him to take his incredible talent and filter it through their [awful] synthesizers. I'm a pretty big Bob Mould/Sugar/Husker Du fan, so it's not like I picked up a random CD here and am complaining. I'm just sad that such an incredible and influential artist as Bob Mould is would release something like this. It just doesn't feel right in any way, shape or form."
4,Not bad--really,"If you asked me to rate Bob Mould's post-Husker Du discs from best to worst, I'd reply: Sugar, Beaster, Last Dog & Pony Show, Besides, FU:EL, Modulate, Workbook, Black Sheets of Rain, Bob Mould (hubcap). Modulate rates about the same as Workbook. None of the songs on this disc are as silly or annoying as ""Megamanic,"" and some of them rank with his better Sugar work. If you like Mould's music, you'll probably like it."
2,Weird Weird Weird,"Not sure on this one yet. I've been listening to it for a couple weeks now and still can't seem to like it all that much. Those annoying vocal effects he uses are retro Cher style. Don't like that at all. However, it is Bob Mould and he's still one of the coolest guys around so I'm going to give it another chance in a few weeks."
1,Everybody Poops,"This time it's Bob's turn. I always thought Grant wrote the cool songs in Husker Du anyway (even if he IS an unbelievable blue-haired Leif Garret-lookin' nitwit). Bob bought some toys. Bob played with toys. Bob recorded Bob playing with toys. Then Bob made a horrible, horrible mistake: Bob released recordings of Bob playing with toys. Oh, well..."
1,Disappointed,"I have been a BM fan for over ten years but this record is an utter disappointment! If I wanted Euro-disco-popoid music, I would have bought the last Cher record. I think we can all understand Bob wanting to explore new directions, but this is too much!"
2,3 strikes and you're out,"After the excercizes in monotone mediocrity of the self titled Bob Mould, and The Last Dog and Pony Show, I was excited to hear that Mould was releasing an album with a different sound. I have to say that this is the biggest mess I have ever heard. The electronica is mindless and does nothing to compliment the lyrics. When Bob finally plugs in his guitar it gets a little better, but there's nothing that excites me very much on this album."
2,Oh my,"I am a big fan, but this is bad. There are usually two songs on each album that I can't get into, with this one, there are only two songs that are passable. Bad lyrics, bad electronica, bad mixing, and he sings with no conviction at all. Please improve Bob, don't make this the last album I buy. I say to old and new fans, do not purchase. I have tickets to his show here this month, will I go? Not sure. Sorry Bob."
4,Give It A Go..,"If punk was invented from scratch today it could well sound like this. Don't be put off by the change in direction this is Bob through and through. The trade mark guitar riffs are there on tracks like Come On Strong. The electro tracks like 180 Rain: good tunes, lyrics and melodies - just Bob without the guitars.If you have got an open mind you'll enjoy this. A fusion of electro and punk. Go on - give it ago!"
4,He Tried,"His experimental tunes aren't THAT bad and might grow on you. They did sound strange at first but I was expecting the Bob Mould or Sugar CD I was used to. The experimental songs are layered with disjointed sounds which reminded me of Simple Minds in their early years, although not as melodic (believe it or not!). The other half of the songs on the CD represent the Bob Mould we have respected from the beginning. These songs are fantastic and are worth the price of the CD. His vocals on the song ""TRADE"" sound like The Alan Parsons Project at their best. Am I crazy? This ia a great ""old school"" song. And my favorite has to be the song ""Soundonsound"". Very emotional and the Bob we used to know. I recommend thid CD for any Bob Mould fan. This is not the CD for the novice Mould fan. For that I would recommend ""Black Sheets of Rain""."
1,unbelievably poor,"I almost wept when I heard this CD. I had enjoyed Bob's previous 2 CDs (""Bob Mould"" 1996 & ""The Last Dog & Pony Show"" 1998) & was really looking forward to this CD. I am not stuck in the 80s & waiting for the next ""New Day Rising"" to appear. I thought this by an immense margin the worst release Bob Mould has ever attached his name to.There are no tunes, no hooks, no anything of interest to anyone who likes ""rock"" music (and yes I know it is most uncool these days to like ""rock"" & not be entranced by drum & bass or something especially if you're in the UK).I noted that a live ""rock"" CD was rush released not long after this, almost as if it was a ""sorry"" to his fans. Not good enough.If you like Bob, rock music & guitars then DO NOT buy this. You WILL be disappointed. I was distraught. Maybe partying will help (coded joke).I only hope that he turns this around & gets around to releasing his dark acoustic ""body of song"" sometime in the next decade.Come on, Bob, you can do it........."
4,"A very rocky start, but not entirely unenjoyable","I came up with 4 stars for this one by comparing it to most other records I hear. If I were to compare it solely to other titles in the Bob Mould discography, I'd give it a 2.5 or a 3. Anyway, it's interesting to hear him experimenting with this type of sound. The results are best when the sound seems the most of a compromise between his traditional thing and the electronic thing. On the cuts where he goes more out on a tweaky limb, it's less pleasing (not surprising, since some of the outfits he thanks in the credits are sorta corny, like Junkie XL.) His vocal style doesn't seem 100% suited to the electronic landscape in the way that someone like Bjork's is, but he makes a good go of it. It just seems that his voice and lyrics and everything else are best suited to a musical backing that rocks out in a traditional guitary way. So, in summary, good effort. Now get back to the normal thing please."
3,"I'm all for artists ""growing musically"" but . . .","I was originally going to write a review along the lines of ""gee, I really hate when artists change their musical style. If I wanted Cher, I'd go buy Cher."" But then I realized that this criticism isn't quite accurate - or fair. There are plenty of artists that ""stretch"" and ""grow"" musically (Beatles, U2, and Peter Gabriel come to mind) and do it well. This cd by Bob Mould is just not of the same caliber. It's not that the songs are bad necessarily, but the electronic noise is a bit grating at times. And since when is electronic music original and fresh? John Lennon was monkeying with his voice 35 years ago. I've read that there is an acoustic cd coming out later this year. I am looking forward to that."
1,I'm not whining that it ain't like the old days!,"OBVIOUSLY this is not the stuff of Husker Du, Sugar, previous solo stuff, et al. I expect musicians to evolve and experiment. I crave it. I bemoan the lack of creativity when they do not. However, I just don't get MODULATE in the least. I adore Bob Mould as a musician and a human being. He will always be my favourite. Perhaps it's my sophomoric musical tastes, but I really just don't get this album. I cannot even appreciate it for its artistic merit. I didn't even like it live."
2,Modulate?? This album is pretty dissapointing.,"I have been listening to Bob for many years, and although I am a true Husker fan, I love almost all of the post husker du material. The idea of evolving as a musician is very acceptable and respectable in most cases. I don't quite understand the idea behind this effort. ""180rain"", the first track on the record, is extremely weak. ""semper fi""???? what kind of title is that? At least he decided to put ""trade"" on this record, which dates back to late 80's husker du. I am really excited to see (a very thin) Bob on tour this april. I must admit, it will be quite interesting to see how this material translates in a live setting. If your a true Bob fan, you will have to decide for yourself, but knowing his capabilities, I am not thrilled."
3,Badulate?,"In places this album sounds like an uninspired Radiohead album while some tracks (Slay/Sway, Receipt, Soundonsound) sound like Sugar songs with odd samples and other electronic oddities thrown in so it sounds like a ""departure"". After hearing the ridiculous track Megamanic on his last solo outing I was fearing this sound was inevitably going to appear again, and though I had hope it would mature a bit before becoming a whole album, I remain disappointed. I'll echo much of what has already been said, some tracks are very catchy and any reviewer should give credit for taking risks, this is after all a business whether fans and artists want to admit it. If I could have my way, Bob would have tried a more stripped-down sound like he did for the acoustic tour of several years ago with a few rockers thrown in. Bob is so gifted though it's hard to give to bad a rating. In hindsight I'd still buy the album, but immediately burn the handful of tracks I like to a ""best of&#65533;""."
1,Mould fans beware: this is not the album you wanted,"If you thought that Bob Mould's self-named album had some good threads for songs but was weakened by the drum machines, poor arrangement and just a little bit too much self indulgence, then you need to take pains to never hear the music on this album. In all fairness, I suppose that it is possible that people new to Mould would like this album, but I've started listening to Husker Du back in the early 1980s, and was a big fan of his first, second and fourth solo albums. I couldn't even listen to the all of ""Modulate"" in one sitting because it is just plain bad."
1,I thought my CD player was broken,I first listened to this CD on my computer CD player at work. I thought something was broken so I tried it again in the car. This is by far the worst album I have ever heard. It's Zooropa times 100.
1,"Good luck to ya, Bobby","Bob's place in the pantheon of music greats is assured but here's where I get off the train. Bon voyage, best of luck to you old pal and thanks for the memories. Hope we get to see Grant, Greg and you play at the R&R hall of fame induction in a few years."
3,Sausage Stuffer,"I agree with other reviewers. The food grinder attachment works well for grinding the sausage meat, but we had trouble getting the sausage mixture to feed into the casing. I found that adding water helped some. I spent several hours on the internet researching dedicated stuffers. They seem to be very expensive or very unsatisfactory. So, we will continue to practice with this one. I am thinking of attaching the stuffing horn to a pastry bag."
2,Cheap plastic won't last,"I have many Kitchen Aid appliances including my dishwasher, stove, microwave and refridgerator. Obviously, I have brand confidence but I'm not happy with this cheap plastic product. I feel the same way about most of the plastic add-ons -- they simply don't stand up to the test of time. My meat grinder cracked and I replaced it with a vintage metal model which will last for years. This product is way over priced considering it's about 25 cents worth of plastic."
3,It's all right...,"I've used this twice in the last week and have made very good sausages with it. My only problem is that for one person it is a very clumsy way to stuff sausages. I'm a chef at a restaurant that makes sausages a lot using a different machine so I know what I'm doing, but this set-up is awkward and a bit frustrating. The plastic plunger that came with the grinder is irksome, having a base that is too narrow compared to the tube, which when trying to stuff meat into the filler tube it allows most of the meat squish up the sides around the plunger. Processing a 5# batch of meat isn't taking me nearly as long as some of the other reviews, but it seems to take a lot longer than necessary. I will be getting a bigger crank style filler, but this one works okay for now."
1,Not even worth the $10,"I agree with the folks who gave this a one star(because there is no lower rating). The grinder is OK but you need to grind through the course plate first then the finer one. The stuffer was useless. Too much air got into the attachment and thus the sausage casing. We gave up and we ended up packaging it in bulk. We could do more by stuffing the mix through with the food pusher provided by KA. Love my machine, but not the stuffer."
5,Great product & price,Product was from KitchenAid and worked well and the deliveery was excelent ... no problem to order other items from Amazon.
4,Good replacement for my other stuffer,This easily replaced another plastic sausage stuffer I had on my Krups meat grinder that was damaged. Works great!
4,very useful,"This worked quite well, it does take some practice to figure out the best way to use it, as it is not 100% fool proof. We made some great sausages with it, though, so definitely give it a try!"
2,"""Missing items""","I recieved two large tube attachments, the kit inventory calls out, one small for breakfast sausage and one large. I have no use for two of the large tubes and cannot use half the recipes in the book I also ordered due to the missing part."
1,Review not necessarily on product,"This review is not necessarily on the product, but rather on the delivery of the product. I had ordered this as a gift for a friend. After waiting and finally recieving it, I proudly gave it to my friend. She excitedly opened it, only to find the product MISSING! While Amazon delivered another one, I found the process tedious to have to send it back in order to not be charged twice."
1,not impressed,"I bought these stuffing tubes with the aspiration to make breakfast & slim jim type sausages from the home-grown beef, pork, and venison that comes into this household. I bought 21 mm collagen casings to use on the smallest stuffing horn, that was the size I wanted. Well, the smallest stuffing horn is tapered, you can only fit 1"" worth of 21 mm collagen casing on it. Would give it zero stars if I could. Absolutely dissappointed with this product. Buy a metal tube stuffer, forget the kitchenaid garbage."
4,Not That Difficult To Use,"I purchased this to make venison sausage. I found it fairly simple to use with only a few draw backs. First two people make the job a lot easier, one to manage the meat going in and one to manage the sausage coming out. I would not attempt this alone. Second, as reviewed, the plastic dowel provided to push the meat into the grinder is not ideal. With the casing on the tube, there is a suction issue, and you seem to pull as much meat out as you push in. We solved this by using a wooden straight sided dowel that fit the hole. The rest is really just getting the hang of it which you'll figure out as you go along. We made two different recipes found on [...], and we wood smoked them. The sausage we made is AMAZING & our husbands think we are the best sausage makers in the world! If you already have the Kitchen Aid & grinder, for $10 bucks, and some effort you can make your own sausage at home!"
3,Value for money but not great,"First, for the price this must be the best sausage stuffer available. But, it is not easy to or fast. This is not due to this product as such but the difficulty of feeding the sausage meat into the grinder ""mouth"". This is especially true if you have a very sticky mixture. It took me longer to stuff the sausages using this product than it did to measure the ingredients and grind it in the first place. I also would have preferred the tubes to be a few inches longer so that they could hold a greater length of casing.Again, this is almost certainly the cheapest way to go (assuming you have aKitchenAid KSM150PSER Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer, Empire RedandKitchenAid FGA Food Grinder Attachment for Stand Mixers) but it is not great at the job. I'll probably buy a purpose built machine in the future."
4,Nice addition,"I made sausage for the first time the other day. It turned out terrific. This product made stuffing the sausage casings very easy. It takes about 15 seconds to stuff a large sausage link, so it moves rather smoothly. The height is tricky however, and takes a minute to adjust to. All you have to do is elevate a bowl beneath the attachment and presto, problem solved."
4,Stuff It!,Works great with out KitchenAid Mixer. Make your own sausage at home without all the high fat content and add spice to your liking. Great recipes online for healthy and flovorful eating.
4,Works just fine,"We were worried after reading all the negative reviews saying it doesn't work, but we found it works just fine. We've used it several times to make two different kinds of sausage. Sausage-making takes a while, and knotting the ends is particularly difficult, but you can't place the blame on this stuffer kit. Our only quibble is that we thought such a simple item could have been priced lower by the manufacturer."
4,Small and fast,I love this used it once so far. Not hard to use and easy to clean. I think its a nice gift for a stand mixer owner.
2,"Works, but way too much effort","Like some others have said,it works but the amount of time it takes to stuff 5 pounds of meat is way too long. I used this on 3 seperate occasions and all three times ,I had the same sub par results.I read the directions and I know I've assembled it correctly.I even contacted kitchenaid on how the plunger isnt a good fit and the meat just squishes up intead of down.They recommend using ""pinches"" of meat so the plunger can ""guide"" the minced meat into the worm mechanism.What a bunch of nonsense.The food grinder does do a good job though...Anyway,Yeah the kitchenaid sausage stuffer was only 7 bucks and yeah, I was able to stuff sausage with it,but using it was becoming a deterrent to making my goodnes known as sausage.;-) I'm going to invest in the LEM 5 pound stuffer.It's alot of money but I'm sure it will work with little effort and make sausage making a fun hobby with excellent benefits."
2,"Works, but far too slow","Bought this to stuff some hog casings, since I already had the grinder attachment for my KitchenAid and didn't want to drop $150 on a vertical stuffer for the rare occasions when I make sausage. Took me well over an hour to stuff a little over 2 pounds of sausage, and I ran into a lot of the issues others have mentioned: meat backing up around the inadequate plastic plunger, insufficient traction from the auger to propel meat through even the large tube, lots of air pockets in the resulting sausage, and so on.I ended up going with aEastman Outdoors 38237 Jerky and Sausage Gun Kit with 5 Extra Nozzlesfor the next batch, which at about $30 was a good compromise over a vertical stuffer for my needs, despite having to reload 5 or 6 times to get through a 6 lb. batch of meat."
3,"Bad design, but better than nothing","After reading the other reviews I went ahead and purchased the stuffer, thinking ""I only make sausage a little at a time, the size of it shouldn't effect me"". Boy was I wrong! The design is really terrible. The top hole is so small that every time you push the meat in you can barely get the plunger out because there is such a strong suction. Also, you can only put the tiniest beat of meat at a time, or when you try to push it down it all just splatters to the side. All those things being said, it does beat doing it by hand."
3,Plunger is too loose to push sausage mix,"The diameter of the plunger for pushing sausage down into the auger is too small. If the sausage mix is moist enough to stuff into casings, it is too moist to remain below the plunger. As you push down, sausage mix oozes around the plunger into the chamber above the bottom of the plunger. This really slows down the stuffing process and results in air entering the auger and your casing. You can eliminate most of the backflow if the sausage mix drier, but this increases the load on the motor and does not significantly speed up the process. The sausage stuffer kit needs its own plunger, one that seals to the inside of the chamber and allows you to push a moist sausage mix without backflow."
1,This is completely worthless,"I've used this stuffer for years because I didn't know any better. Please read the negative comments, they are all true. I saw Julia Childs using a jerky gun and had an epiphany.Eastman Outdoors 38237 Jerky and Sausage Gun Kit with 5 Extra NozzlesThis works perfectly. It holds one pound of meat per load and I can stuff 5 lbs of sausage in about 15 minutes with no swearing and little mess. With a little practice you can load the cylinder with no air pockets and cleanup is a cinch. The one caveat is that it is so efficient that it is easy to over stuff the casing causing it to burst when you twist the links.That said, the meat grinder is pretty good but don't waste your money or your time on the sausage stuffing attachment"
1,What a mess,"I love my KitchenAid stand mixer and the meat grinding attachment. However, this attachment is another story. The sausage mixture should be pulled through the stuffer tube by the auger in the mixer, that didn't happen. The only way to make this work was to use the plastic food pusher to push the mixture in into the hopper and force it into the stuffer tube. This process was a mess, with the meat mixture ""squishing"" around the poorly designed pusher base and collecting on the pusher.Someone suggesting contacting KitchenAid to get one of the ""old style"" wooden pushers - which is a solid piece and wouldn't allow the meat to squish back up around the pusher base. I called KA and they told me that they no longer have these pushers and they were discontinued long ago."
1,Awful,"Impossible to get the meat down the feed tube. Once it's there, the suction from the pusher sucks most of the meat away from the auger. An awful purchase. Don't buy it."
2,There's a trick,"The first few times we used our sausage stuffer attachment, I wondered how anyone could give this a positive review. It honestly seemed tp stuff just as fast with the machine off, and the poorly-fitting plunger pushed huge amounts of air through the stuffer and into the sausage. Then I found the trick to getting it to work.Getting air out of the system is the only way to get the feed screw to work. The easiest way to do this is to work a drinking straw up and down the feed chute while gently pressing on the plunger. You'll feel the plunger drop as air escapes. Once the air's out, the stuffer will actually stuff pretty well. Keep working the straw as you go.The straw trick actually made this thing worth the $9. Without it, it's terrible."
1,terrible attachment - don't waste your money - it STINKS!,"As others have noted - you will experience unacceptable difficulties in three areas:1) Unimaginably slow feeding/extruding of the raw sausage mixture2) Excessive amounts of air entering grinder chamber and eventually blowing up your casings like a balloon3) The plunger end of the handle tool is too narrow and much of the meat mixture just oozes out of the chamber instead of getting rammed down.Note that these are issues with the design of the grinder assembly in terms of its ability to handle sausage meat. The sausage feed tubes are just ordinary, plastic, tapered tubes.Look elsewhere to stuff sausage - I'm going to purchase a standalone electric stuffer."
1,Save your money and stuff sausage by hand,"The sausage stuffer was too big for the casing, and too small for the food grinder. The grinded meat squished out of the sides and made a huge mess. It would be easier and cheaper to do it by hand!"
2,A lot of meat gets stuck in it.,The meat doesn't move very well and there is a lot of meat stuck in it at the end.
4,Great Sausages,The sausage stuffer is an addition to the mincer and cannot be used on its own. An eEssential tool if you wish to make professional looking sausages. I buy natural casings from my local butcher. Once separated they feeeze well and just need thawing and soaking for about an hour. The variety of fillings is endless and there are some interesting ideas on the web. I wait until pork shoulder is on special offer then make a batch to freeze. Once the meat is minced it can by divided and flavoured and spiced in different ways. It seems expensive for what it is but I am pleased I bought it.
1,Flawed,Meat grinder does not work as sausage stuffer.Augur spins in meat mixture and doesn' force ground meat out through nozzle.Pushing tool doesn't fit. We had to fashion one from PVC pipe and use it to force meat into casing.Don't waste your money!
3,Sausage Stuffer,"I formerly used a 4"" piece of pipe my father cut to manually stuff Swedish potato sausage (potatis korv) which was time consuming and boring. The KitchenAid Sausage Stuffer was also time consuming in that the ""pusher"" with indented sides fills with sausage that needs to be manually removed...but not boring.As a positive note, the parts are easily assembled and are dishwasher friendly."
1,This Bad Design Will Waste Your Time,"Technically, it is the plunger on the Kitchen Aid food/meat grinder that will waste your time. The plunger is great for the larger chunks of meat. But once the meat is ground, the gap between the plunger and the wall of the grinder is large enough to allow the meat to pass. So as I tried to push the meat down into the auger, feeding it into the sausage stuffer, most of the meat was pushed out the sides. Increasing the speed of the auger doesn't help.If this product came with a plunger with rubber/silicone extensions that create a fairly good seal, it would probably work much better and earn more 5 stars."
2,"good for a ""starter""","I owned this and the meat grinder when I decided to try my hand at making sausages. I worked, but had problems with air pockets. Finally bite the bullet and bought a vertical stuffer. Huge difference. no more air pockets! If you are just starting out, this will let you stuff the sausages. If you get hooked on making sausages, invest in something better."
1,Worst ever!,"The sausage stuffer attachment for the KitchenAid is a JOKE! I could have done a better job using a funnel and a spoon. It took me 5 hours to stuff 3.5# of sausage. It is really a pain to use. Really! The food pusher is too small and allows the chicken glop to ooze around it. So I ended up having to push it into the small feeder tube by hand then use the pusher to shove it down to the auger. 3.5# done a teaspoon at a time like this. And it is very messy to use as well. There was raw chicken glop all over the place and along with all of the hours of work already, it took another hour and half to clean up the mess. If there were minus stars this POS would get a minus 5 stars."
1,would not buy,the grinder attachment that you use for this sausage stuffer does not work good at all. The grinder gets clogged up with membranes and you constantly have to keep taking apart to clean. Not worth it! Go ahead and spend extra money and get meat grinder with sausage maker from bass pro or cabelas or amazon.
2,dont like it,"I dont like this attachment. Unless your mixture is really fine, the forcemeat and larger chunks of fat tend to clog up at the end of the feeder. I make a lot of dried sausage (sopressata, salami, etc) where you want some larger chunks of fatback in the mixture. This can become a problem when you need to clear a jam 3 or 4 times when stuffing only 5-10 lbs of sausage. It just takes too long. Then there is the issue of bubbles. You really have to work the casings and squeeze in the meat to get a firm fill. It's all just too much work and you almost need 2 people (one to feed and the other to work the casing). I may just buy one of those manual old fashioned cast iron stuffers for $50 and see how it goes..."
4,Easier with the right info,"Sausage making is an artform. It can be difficult to get the hang of, but with the right info you can make wonderful, fresh sausage and feel good about the ingredients inside. This sausage attachment works pretty well. The hopper is a little small, but unless you are making a ton at a time, it's not a deal breaker. It's important to keep the meat really cold throughout the process though or the fat will melt and could hurt your mixer engine. I picked up The Mixer Bible which has about 35 sausage recipes along with 300 other recipes for the mixer and it's other attachments. I really like the book and it walks you through the ins and outs of working with all the attachments."
1,Don't Waste Your Time & Money,"The plunger does not have a tight enough seal to stuff the already ground and seasoned sausage meat into the casing. As a result, your ground sausage meat ends up getting ground again by the worm feeder. Your sausage ends up looking like hot dog or bologna meat. A press style sausage is the only way to go."
4,Stuffs Sausages...,"Not much else to say. To those that have had issues, make sure you take out the grind attachment and cutting blade. Follow the instructions for assembly, it's not that hard. And get good casings, and the right kind (there ARE options based on what you make) Go to your local butcher, ask them for recommendations, buy some extra, practice, they're cheap and easy to work with"
3,Home made sausage,"I have never tried making sausage before so I can't compare it to anything. I found it to be a slow process, but I like the finished product."
2,engineering missed again,"its just a simple plastic tube that fits on the end of the grinder attachment so you can stuff sausage. So how did they manage to mess this one up? The flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder, so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place, the collar can not screw on all the way. The result? A build up of meat in the front part of the collar. This eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment. How hard would it have been for Kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight?"
2,"Too much time wasted, hard to work","I am a professional sausagemaker and a food scientist. I wanted to try to make sausage at home with my KitchenAid mixer and grinder attachment. It took 3 hrs to stuff 10 lb meat. It is worthless, time consuming, labor intensive. The plunger pulls back the meat you push in. The worm inside the grinder tube does not move efficently. And yes we did not attach the knife and plate. The tray needs to be larger, the grinding unit needs to be larger, the plunger needs to be straight. This is an awful design engineering. KitchenAid needs to replace their designer, too."
3,sausage stuffer kit attachment,same thing as hog casing never used product have to reorder hog casings for same price to use this product
5,Kitchen Aid Sausage Stuffer,"If you have the Kitchen Aid grinder you must get the Sausage Stuffer kit! Making your own sausage is easy fun and healthy! This is a simple, cheap, small piece of plastic but it is what you need to stuff sausage casings. You should get it and get started making your own lean low salt sausage!"
1,Completely and utterly worthless.,"Out of several pounds of meat, we were literally able to stuff one tiny hot dog. Very glad that we didn't spend more than $10 on it. We'll be purchasing something else."
1,Are these 5 Star Reviews insane?,"This is a completely useless piece of plastic. The sausage gets stuck and does not extrude. I spent more time taking off the attachment and clearing the plastic piece then stuffing sausage. Then it would get stuck again, take off attachment, clean out plastic, just so that it could spurt out an ounce or two of sausage- and then inevitably get stuck again. Since the worm drive is still turning, while the sausage is stuck, it is melting and smearing the fat- rendering most of the sausage that I made useless. So frustrating. And an expensive mistake.Not to mention the sharp corners of the plastic which caused tears in even the toughest casing.I am following the sage advice of everyone I have spoken to and am dropping the money (about $130) for a legitimate 5lb. handcrank stuffer.DO NOT BUY!!! (I warned you!)"
3,Zombies! Shotguns! Nuns! Kablooie!,"Sometimes, you just want to see zombies explode.Fortunately, Joe R. Lansdale understands your needs, and can provide for them, with Timothy Truman riding shotgun with the art. In Dead Folks, a bounty hunter and his quarry run into a mass of zombie evangelicals, including their mad scientist prophet and some buxom nuns. There's a lot of shooting, a brief break for exposition, and then some more shooting.This isn't exactly Watchmen, but nor does it try to be. Simply put, a finer example of bounty hunter/nun/zombie/scientist graphic fiction would be difficut to find"
3,soph slump,"Something about this CD seems to inspire longwinded reviews, but I'll keep mine short.Not nearly as good as the first CD. Production is lusher, granted, but the songs aren't as tight or melodic or memorable. Yes, the two standout tracks -- Hold Me Now and Two Thousand Places -- hark back to Beginning Stages. . ., but the rest just seem kind of messy and uninspired. Also, the band's roots in MOR ""independent"" `90s music come through too often and the choral flourishes are revealed to be frosting on the moldy cake. The first CD will stay in my car. This one gets thrown in the closet."
4,"good, yes. original, not really.","I really like this music. However, has anyone noticed that The Polyphonic Spree (most especially on Together We're Heavy) seems to have lifted its sound, and its performances, directly from The Flaming Lips? (Sound entirely from the Soft Bulletin.) There's a distinction to be made between ripping-off a sound and a stage presence, and being inspired. The Polyphonic Spree is definitely the latter, taking a lot of initiative and finding their own direction with the style of music created by Wayne Coyne, Stephen Drozd and Michael Ivins for The Soft Bulletin. I am only a little dismayed that even some of the Spree lyrics mirror those of the Lips influential 1999 CD."
1,Not My Cup Of Tea,"Even though I don't listen to this style of music, I still took a chance at it. Signed by Hollywood Records, Polyphonic Spree is a twenty-team hippie-esque loving band who wants to make the world happy. The background of course is very joyous and upbeat, but the lyrics and sounds are again to a hippish style. It will be a long while before hippie pop comes back but hey, maybe Polyphonic Spree can spread some cheer to places where they need it. Peace~"
1,trite...,"Any comparison to the Beatles is ridiculous. Looks more like Godspell, Hair, or any of the other embarassingly ""hip"" musicals of the 60's. Their harmonies are often sung unison, and a bit out of tune, which makes their name even sillier, if that's possible. I saw them on PBS, and I thought it was a comedy act at first. A grand effort, but very little talent here."
5,What the world needs...,"The Polyphonic Spree have done it. This record is epic. A fairy tale ride of instruments and sounds that is both positive and inspiring. In a time when there is so much hate in the world, this record storms in to put a smile on all our faces. I think even the darkest and most cynical can be turned around with this one. It also does a tremendous job of capturing the energy and thrill of their live shows which is the first thing everyone talks about when their name is mentioned. Get this one, you won't be disappointed."
3,tripping daisy meets flaming lips,"Tripping Daisy were one of the best alternative bands of the 1990s, but the newsest faction of the Polyphonic Spree leave the listener dazed and prozac happy. I think this could be good, but there are too many things going on to make it worthwhile. I guess you might dig this if you like the Flaming Lips or huge choral groups but this was not for me. Buy Jesus Hits like the Atom Bomb by Tripping Daisy and hear a real masterpiece."
4,together were heavy,It makes me happy... I listen to it a lot. It should be the soundtrack for a Super Mario Brothers movie.
4,A Definate Improvement,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed ""Begining Stages""... however, the thought of ""Begining Stages Part 2"" wasn't too interesting.Thankfully, DeLaughter and Co. rolled the dice a bit. The opening track throws in some Flaming Lip-esque sonic distortion. From there it's a roller coaster ride that feels more varried and interesting than ""Begining Stages"" ended up being on a complete listen.Nothing quite sticks in your mind the way the singles from the prior album does, however I don't see that as a negative point. Ever try staying sane while one of those songs loops in your head over and over all day? It ain't easy.I would definately reccomend ""Heavy"" for those who felt ""Begining Stages"" felt flat or got too repetitive. Cheers!"
4,Psychedelic Bliss,"I don't give 5 star ratings out very easily, but this one would have warranted that if I had not considered a few of the songs on this CD that I don't like. The opening cut, ""A Long Day Continues/We Sound Amazed"", might be my favorite. It starts out serenely and then slams into a guitar driven section, and winds up with a lengthy and beautiful psychedelic jam that is dominated by a throbbing, bouncing, bass guitar and hypnotic piano. Brass randomly intrudes to help give the jam a chaotic ""acid trip"" effect. I can't say enough about this song. I love it. The other song that really knocks me out is ""Suitcase Calling"". It contains a blissed out chorus that is almost literally breathtaking. This CD has less cheese than the first, and it contains some of the finest music that I've heard in many years. I hope this offering from the Spree does well because I'm already hankerin'(that's Texan for ""jonesing"")for the next one."
1,Yuck!,"I was subjected to this horrid group's music while my mom was watching PBS. They dress up in asinine costumes (kaftans, robes, whatever they are) and sing annoying ""BA! DA!"" background vocals. The lead singer in an interview acted like he was stoned! There's a reason they're not really well-known. You know what it is? They don't make music. THEY MAKE NOISE! Stay away from their CD's at all costs."
1,eeeewwwwww!,"These guys are ri-di-cu-lous! I thought it was a joke when I saw a commercial for one of their concerts...........Sorry, folks, but I just can't take them seriously. Next Spinal Tap, anyone?"
2,Disappointed to Tears,"If you are looking to replace a ""real"" Gary Schrodt floral decal feeder, do NOT buy this one. It will break your heart -- a cheap knock-off of the elegant product that once was and, alas, is no more. I still have my old one for comparison, so this is not just nostalgia talking. The decal lacks the metallic gold highlights and subtle coloration, but it is the wooden top and base that are really disgusting -- instead of artisan-quality woodworking, in redwood (mill ends!), this ugly thing is big and block-y with a hideous orange-red stain on some cheap, big-grained hunk of whatever. The metal base piece is smaller, and not the same lovely little shape as before. It's like replacing a Dolce & Gabbana blouse with something from Wal-Mart. Broke my heart.Hummingbirds do like the design, however. So it gets one extra star."
5,Beautiful work of art that the hummers love!!!,"Lovely, easy to fill and clean, this is a perfect feeder! I am thinking of buying a few more soon!"
3,"very pretty, needs perches",The feeder looks great (the purple color is so attractive in the sunlight)but it is very difficult to clean because the mouth of the feeder is so narrow. Also I had to add perches so that the hummers had somewhere to land. It is priced a little high but I am overall satisfied with the purchase.
2,Where are the hummingbirds?,"No idea why the hummingbirds aren't coming anywhere near this thing. To me, it looks great, and it seems very sturdy and I basically love it...but who knows what hummingbirds are attracted to in a feeder?"
3,Beaded Flowers,"This book is intended for the creative beader who is not afraid of selecting her own colors, or inventing her own projects from the beaded flowers.There are enough different flowers to tempt anyone that enjoys making beaded flowers to get into this romantic craft that is enjoying a revival along with everything beady."
5,Class with Dalene,I have the honor of being able to take classes taught by Dalene making the flowers that are shown in this book. I have found the book to be easy to read and very helpful.
2,zippy,i thought price to good to be true.i was suppose to get bonded leather.instead crappy old green paperback.threw in goodwill.dissappointed.purchased copy in store so icould see item.
3,"Awesome devotional, not so awesome edition.","I would give this item five stars if it was the original edition, which I thought it was. However, when I got it in the mail, I noticed it said ""updated in today's modern language."" I think what makes Oswald's writings so powerful is also the way he writes, with a sense of mystery and flavor. I compared it side-by-side with an older edition I have and found that this edition was dull in constrast. It lacks the life and spirit of the original.Don't read a dumbed-down ""easy"" Oswald Chambers. Even if you find his original writings a bit difficult at first, keep on reading and you'll begin to piece things together in a way that is ultimately epiphanic."
1,Buy the original!,"Like some of the other reviewers, I discovered this is an ""updated edition"" after I bought it. Part of the power of this devotional classic derives from the wonerful way Chambers says things. This version is stale and flat compared to the original. I noticed it immediately, having read the original many times. Upon comparing this version with my well worn print copy, I discovered many silly and useless changes that eliminate the impact of Chamber's origimal words.Do yourself a favor~buy the ""classic"" edition."
2,This was a waste..,"I have the daily devotional book, and I decided to get the calendar version for my mom. The original book devotional is awesome, but this is so condensed it's barely useful. It takes away from the eloquence of the original version. It's pretty much just a scripture a day."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Excellent for most people. It's a wonderful book, but I waslooking for a hard back book in large print. So I had to returnthe book for a refund. No problem."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this purchase. It advertised a chance to see the book before the purchase, but that was misleading. The link led to the original version which is what I intended to buy, but instead the book I received features updated text. I was a little disappointed with that."
5,OSWALD CHAMBERS UTMOST FOR HIS HIGHEST,"ARRIVED AS PROMISED, THIS WAS A GIFT FOR A DEAR FRIEND. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL....THANK YOU AMAZON FOR A WONDERFUL SERVICE ONCE AGAIN...."
5,Life changing!,"This is the most outstanding daily devotional I have ever found. Summarized from the weekly messages he preached, these devotionals show the great depth of love and understanding Oswald Chambers had for the Word of God. It is amazingly just as alive today as when it was written a hundred years ago. I was unable to get enough of it, and I went through the book twice. A must read for every Christian dedicated to the study of the Word. You can begin each day with an uplifting thought about how we can do our best, our utmost, for God."
2,"A mixed bag, full of contradictions","Chambers' devotional classic is long on practical advice for Christian living, but theologically confused. This is astonishing, considering the author sat under the preaching of the great C H Spurgeon, heir to the Reformed Puritan tradition. It is mystical, even gnostic or pelagian in many places. There is no mention of a church, of the sacraments. Instead, the Christian ""worker"" is portrayed as an isolated self-made spiritual giant. The influences are clearly Wesleyan with references to entire sanctification and the second blessing. Spurgeon's meticulous teaching is rejected through Chambers' confusion of the classic Protestant doctrine of justification with sanctification. The substitutionary atonement of Christ on the cross for the sins of God's people is strangely bypassed - instead the crucifixion is depicted as a mystical ""higher life"" example of how individual Christians are to live. There is much practical wisdom, but READ WITH DISCERNMENT!"
2,Book was Not Used - Like New,I was disappointed that the book cover was well worn and not Used - Like New. I would have expected this condition to be labeled USED.
4,A classic for all Christians!,This book has the time tested truth that only someone that has walked closely with the Lord could know. You will read this book for the rest of your life!
5,The greatest devotional ever,"For those of us who like profound insight into everyday Christianity (along the line of C. S. Lewis), My Utmost For His Highest is a must. I now see why the typical reader of this Oswald Chamber's classic continue to read it for the rest of their lives. There are 365 devotionals about a page each (small pages too). Very quick reads for those of us who don't have time for the longer devotional books. Buy it...what'd'ya got to lose?Note: I believe this is an updated version where the language is revised for the modern reader. I prefer the classic edition to see exactly how Chamber's wrote these devotionals, so you might want to search around for the original edition (though, the language can be a little King James-ish)"
3,"Book is great, audio is fine, track naming is poor","Magnificent book, and Michael Card is a reasonably good reader; However, the MP3 tags and file names do not reveal the date of the page being read. The MP3 files are merely named 0001.mp3 to 0371.mp3, which means that 0001 to 0005 are the introduction and preface. To be useful, you have to organize the files and rename them all. The MP3 tags are also not helpful."
5,More than brilliant..,"This collaboration of useful and powerful messages given to us by Chambers is, in my opinion, one the best you could own. It might be a little too deep for beginning Christians, but that doesn't mean you can't get great insight from it. There are many different topics that all of us can relate to. The short writings for each day aren't just cute little notes that give you a giggle, but are highly spiritual and will have you pondering for the rest of the day. What a blessing this book is."
5,Never out of date. Great devotional.,Oswald Chambers wrote a masterful devotional book. Never gets old. He goes deeper than just the surface of the scriptures.
3,ok,I got better devonational books to read. this is ok but alot of the time I realy don't get what he is saying.
5,My Utmost for His Highest,"I have been a student of Oswald Chambers for the last 45 years and especially of My Utmost updated. In my opinion, he is one of the few relatively modern Apostles. Tremendous insight and wisdom. I would want it on the bedside table of every Christian, but to read!"
5,The Best Daily Devotion Around!,"In my humble opinion, Chambers' gem is the best devotion ever published! This is my 15th straight year with this title and every year I learn something new. Chambers' insights are as relevant now as they were when originally written in the early 1900s.Admittingly, the updated version makes the devotion easier to digest as opposed to the original language. The format is excellent and has a good flow: brief heading at the top, a Bible verse, a one page summary for each day, and a date. The daily devotional will pierce your soul and make you really think about your walk with Jesus.I've tried other summaries and they pale in comparison to My Utmost for His Highest! Highly recommended - be ready to highlight and make notes. The devotion is an excellent supplement to the Bible."
3,"It's the ""classic"" edition. And navigating the book is a chore.","It's great to have this book available for the Kindle, but it's a bad port. Daily readings run together (not separated by pages like the 'real' book), hyphens are all over the place inappropriately, and the text looks like a bad photocopy. Oh, and it's not the 'modern' English edition.Nonetheless, I'm reading it and using it...until an updated edition comes out, anyway."
3,"Great, but big and bulky",This copy is too big and not handy. I have seen smaller and lighter copies of this great devotional by Oswald Chambers.
5,nice book,Great daily devotional by a great christian thinker. I love the leather binding. Buy it for friends and family members. Can't go wrong.
5,Great way to start the day,"Each lesson is an eye opener for me. This is my first year through this book. I read it daily upon awakening. This book is a good guide to right relationships with the LORD, my fellows and myself. It is direct and to the point. I need that."
5,My Upmost for His Higest,I read from this every morning. The best devotional I've ever used. While visiting my dad I let him read from mine while I was there. I had to buy this one because my Dad liked it so much I gave him mine.
3,Excellent book but poor copy quality.,"THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE QUALITY OF THE REPRINT (IT IS AN OLD BOOK THAT HAS BEEN REPRINTED) I AM ABLE TO READ IT, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE SOME OF THE PRINT BECAUSE IT IS SO LIGHT AND UNEVEN. THE BOOK IS A WONDERFUL READ THAT COVERS THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGINAL WESTERN TERRITORY (OHIO, INDIANA, KENTUCKY, AND MISSOURI AS DESCRIBED BY AN EARLY METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH CIRCUIT RIDER). i have read it before and wanted a copy to keep, since I had given my earlier copy away. Do read the book if you haven't."
5,these work!,"Just got these. I've worn a few times and they work great! Discs don't show under my t-shirts and haven't caused any skin irritation; they just cover what they're supposed to. Bandaids never worked well for me - even doubled and tripled. Didn't prevent show-through and caused skin irritation. Also tried the silicone covers but they were awful - you could see the outline under my t-shirts and they also irritated my skin. Even though I think these are a little expensive, I'm ordering another pair so I have a spare set."
5,They work for me,"The concealers do their job and I am very happy with them. Once in place, they do not move around at all. I'm so glad that I found these here at Amazon."
4,A little pricey,You can see the outline of the disc through your light colored shirts. A little pricey. Not bad pulling them off...just do it slowly! Sometimes I forget they are even there...
5,Best nipple concealers I've tried,"I had a breast reduction a number of years ago and one of the side-effects is that my nipples are always on ""alert"". (Kind of embarrassing.) I found these concealers and use them whenever I'm concerned and they do a great job. They are fairly invisible under your clothing. I have to take them off after 6-7 hours, though, because they start feeling itchy. I'm glad I bought them and they are so well made that they will last for a long, long time."
3,they're ok,"with all the raves this product gets everywhere and my *ahem* problem, I thought - what the heck - I should get one and see. Well, this does a good job ""concealing"" and I was suprised that the seams that fan out did not show through thinner fabrics. I did experience some shifting around of this product. Unlike other similar products, there is no adhesive nor gel that keeps this in place. On me, they stay put only if the bra is on the tighter side and well applied to my skin. I wonder if this has to do with variation in body warmth or not. If so, I must be cold-blooded."
2,Not the same quality,"I previously purchased a pair of disc covers sold by this same company, however, this pair is not the same quality. I compared the two side by side and you can visibly see the difference in the material. It makes me wonder if the company switched manufacturers. The material is thinner and cracks easily. I have to return mine because one of the sections on one cover, broke off."
4,"Somewhat mistitled, but not bad","Only four of the songs on this CD were really great hits for the Gaylords, and one of those (Tell Me You're Mine) is a remake, not the original version. Nevertheless, two of the songs (""Eh, Cumpari"" and ""Return to Me""), though they were hits for OTHERS, not for the Gaylords, are the kind of Italianate song that the Gaylords specialized in and are done very well here.Other reviewers preferred the CD called ""The Mercury Years."" That may be a better collection, but it is out of print. So if you want samples of the Gaylords' artistry, either look for used CDs or buy this one... and I have to admit I liked listening to this CD even if there may have been a better compilation available in the past."
3,fun music,"THis CD was purchased as a gift for my mother, and she loves listening to the Gaylords and other Italian music."
2,Boring!,"I barely even picked up this book for the class I took, but when I did. . . good lord it was boring! I could barely stay awake reading this thing!"
1,Weak in the soft porn genre,really amateurish- home movies these days are better. A total waste of BoDerek's beauty.
1,what a disappointment!,"I bought this book based on the reviews I read here, but must say that I found nothing in this novel that made my believe my money was well-spent. The writing was flat, the characters uninteresting and under-developed, the mystery a bit lame. I skimmed two-thirds of the novel,(there was nothing to hold my eyes on the words!) and still managed to get the gist of a story that left me wondering where all these excellent ratings had come from. I hope this doesn't represent the best of Mariah Stewart."
3,Based on the Atari video game,"I've never played the game, but this graphic novel carries some signs of its parentage. There's non-stop action with plenty of ""first person shooter"" potential, characters tend toward the one-dimensional, and the colors come straight from a box of Skittles (as does the apparent sugar buzz).It makes a fair read, if you want simple adventure, and might appeal to aficionados of the early-1980s or late-70s game. I'm saving my shelf space for books with more re-read appeal, however.-- wiredweird"
5,Moody and touching,"I bought thic CD in 1995 and was not disappointed. The feel of the music for a sad movie of a great but controversial man was just beautiful. Terence has a warm and sad tone. The music just grows on you. Once you have seen the movie, the music will stay with you. I strongly recommend it."
3,Looks good but....,Looks great until you splash something on it. Washing just runs the color from the stitching and piping... lots of dark edges and splotches. So try to keep it clean. It is NOT washable like KitchenAid says.
4,Beautiful black and white photos of Angkor before tourism,"This is a rare find: a book of beautiful photographs of one of the world's most famous religious monuments. Yet, these were pictures taken almost 100 years ago, long before the Angkor ruins became as famous or as exploited as they are now. The book appeals most to those who have seen the actual ruins. After my recent trip to Cambodia, I delighted in looking over these old photographs, comparing in my mind my travel experiences with those depicted in the book. I was amazed by their similarities, as well as their differences. I almost wished I could have travelled back in time to 1909 to actually witness these awe-inspiring ruins before the advent of mass tourism and commercialization. This tome allows the reader to do just that.It is a must have for those who have visited these ancient sites and loved them. The quality of the book is very high and the images are superbly reproduced."
5,I find myself looking at the world through others' eyes.,"Gibran uses words in a way that makes you question your own beliefs, ideas and views of yourself and the world that surrounds you. Every piece of work makes you feel something new, like a seedling sprouting inside yourself. Making you realize more and more about who you want to become and what kind of life you are living now. Each time I open this book, my heart begins to pound because I know that I am about to embark on a great adventure into a spiritual world full of wonder."
5,thoughtful,I first began reading his work in high school. I wish his work was more well known. Please give it a try.
4,Could Be Better,"I had high hopes for this book, because the title is so correct. However, the author is making it TOO personal. Sure, each of us has our own perspective and is free to write it, but it is overwhelming. It is the kind of thing where the arguments are right on, but the presentation ruins it. If some of the harshness had been filtered, it could have received five stars because it highlights things that most people do not know."
3,Crossing Gate,The Crossing gate lowers every time the train goes by but the gates do not stay down until the entire train passes. This is due to the pressure mechanism that lowers the gate when the train is present.I hope over time it will improve itself through use. I did not receive any instructions on this problem.
1,Not recommend,"Beautiful product, easy to assemble and drive the gates good, however the move ends with the train causing derailment. Not recommend"
4,"Nice, but could be better","In case you're wondering, this crossing's lights are not operational, and there are no sounds of any kind. It simply connects with other E-Z Track rails, and off you go. The gates are lowered when the train passes through and pushes down on the panel between the rails. The system is entirely mechanical, and quite delicate - not for small kids. It doesn't work very well with light trains - engines can actually lose contact with the rails and stop (usually only a problem when going slow), while light cars can get quite easily derailed (esp. if they're last). I would not recommend it for unattended operation, unless you weigh down all the cars. Also, it works better on a smooth surface rather than carpet (slide a sheet of construction paper underneath). Overall, a nice, fun addition to any set. My crossing came in green, not yellow."
4,Nice crossing,"An excelent complement for my boy's track, the only complain is the car weight is light the barriers wont rise much."
1,Not the best.,"Arms bounce up and down the whole time the train is passing. They SHOULD stay down. Not very sturdy, either. Parts keep falling off. Danger of getting lost.Addendum: Well, things DID get lost, and the arms got broken and the whole thing is now in the trash. Not worth the price. (Didn't even make 3 months.)"
2,i dont really like it,"this is my review for the ""bachmann e-z track crossing gate"". no offense to the creators but this isnt a very good product. here are some reasons:1: not a very high quality pressure plate2: the gates bounce up and down3: on the one I got one of the signal/sign poles wasnt straight4: its ment for the light grey roadbed e-z track(says so on box anyway)but has black roadbedthose are the things I didnt like on this product now you get to see the plus side of things:1: the rails fit nicely when you conect it to your track2: it kinda ""spruces up yor layout""3: nice detailingso that is my review. overall it isnt the best thing in the world to buy but its ok I guess."
1,pittodrie,"this looks great but is a piece of junk,the only reason it got a 1 is amazon doesn't allow negative numbers.one gate works one doesn't.it falls apart ,recommend buying a different one i wouldn't pay >$1."
5,Awesome addition to layout,We are building from a basic track. This is a great addition. Strongly recommend this item. Great for my kids to get excited about.
3,Morticians in Space,"I never would have thought that spacefarers would keep large stocks of embalming fluid in their ships, but what do I know. I also wonder at the clear sense of up and down that exists aboard these spaceships, and how they seem to come to a dead stop when their drives are busted. I give Connell high marks for narrative drive; that's what enabled me to finish, and even enjoy the book despite being revolted by the violence, the characters, the society described and nearly everything else in the book. If an alien race had arrived and exterminated humanity, I would have called it a happy ending. In the end, I give it a qualified recommendation to space-opera fans with strong stomachs."
4,Great continuation of a--so far-- great trilogy!,"Lackey does a fantastic job of pulling people deeper into the heart of Valdemar with this second installment in the mage-storms. Revealing more of the tensing plot, adding in new characters and situations... to make this a good book, but maybe not as good as the first. I look forward to reading the third installment in the trilogy, which is sure to be the best of the bunch! If you've read Lackey and enjoyed her style, read this trilogy!"
2,"A disappointing continuation of the ""Mage Winds"" trilogy.","Compared to other Lackey books--which I consider to be without question among the absolute best writing available in *any* genre--this book was a big, dull, disappointment. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen, but all I got was political maneuvering, winter manor administration (do you *really* want to read about sewage treatment in a fantasy novel?), and endless internal monologues. You get detailed to death.I think one of the problems is that the 'opponent' here is not a sentient entity (so far as we know), but the magical equivalent of a natural phenomenon. It's difficult to feel much emotion towards it, and while I was rather glad to have a break from Lackey's usual sadistic evil mages, I don't think this quite worked. Read it only if you liked the first book and intend to read the third; otherwise, stick to her earlier books."
3,predictable and drawn out,Mercedes Lackey is a good story teller but after reading the last of the herald mage series and the queens own this story was very predictable. Disaster! Miraculous solution! World saved. It shouldnt have been a 3 book series.
3,Well hmm....,"I love the Valdemar series, but this is definately not one of my favorite series in the bunch. The plotline is very good, I admit: The various countries must band together and all chip in to find some way to defend themselves against a larger enemy who is determined to rule them all. At the same time, ancient echoes of a tremendous amount of magic being released are striking on man again, making magic turn wild and rampant once again, threatening all that lives. The plot is good, but I found myself having trouble relating with the characters and finding my attention wandering. The best parts were those with Elspeth and Darkwind back in the story! But if you are a Heralds of Valdemar fan, then I would suggest you read it, but if not then I would start somewhere else."
3,umm.....,"I absolutely *adore* Misty's Valdemar books (especially the Vanyel and Talia trilogies), but Misty seems to be getting rather long-winded as she continues writing. I mean, the Arrows trilogy was about half the size of the Storms trilogy and about 10 times more exciting. So far, the Storms trilogy has been a bit disappointing to me. I'm trying to slog through the 3rd book right now..."
1,Kindle Version,"I don't know who they had to scan these books,but whoever it was didn't bother to check it very well. It is full of errors, garbled phrases and missing words. If I had known it was going to be so riddled with such annoyances, I would never have purchased it.The story itself is quite good,but the scan is terrible."
4,A brief but compelling fact-based historical mystery,"The author has obviously done much research on this topic and time period; it shows in this story. While basing the book on some facts about the alleged murder of Edward II, Doherty uses that as a starting off point and weaves a very credible tale of what-ifs and possibilities. The book has the flavor, smells, sights, and sounds of the middle ages. Caution: this book may make you want to go dig through the musty files of history yourself into the details of the baffling death of a king."
5,Sure does take me back...,"I was only 17, 18 or so when the Starck Club was in full swing. It was a mythical place for a girl from Bedford, Texas. How in the world did I go about getting on the guest list, I often wondered. I lived at Confetti's on Greenville and Lovers but somehow getting into the Starck was a challenge...and if I ever did, would it be as grand as I had heard? Well, it was...I will never forget it. Great documentary...wish it was longer with more pictures, nevertheless very well done. Can't believe that was 25+ years ago. Now I am a mom and would I let my daughter go to a place like that?...HELL NO...but I will secretly grin when she tries. Of course they don't make 'em like that anymore so hopefully I won't have to worry about it."
2,Doesn't quite go with Canon 18-200mm F3.5-56 lens,"I bought this item to go with my Canon 18-200mm F3.5-56 lens for my Canon 40D. Well, I was disappointed to see that at 18mm this hood leaves a nice vignette. You have to zoom it to around 40-50mm to get rid of it, but then you don't have wide angle. I wish I knew this from the beginning. In other words - you get what you pay for!"
5,Perfect fit for the Raynox DCR-6600PRO 0.66x 52mm HD Wide Angel Conversion Lens,"Bought this for theRaynox DCR-6600PRO 0.66x 52mm HD Wide Angel Conversion Lens, mounted on my Canon HF-M500 camcorder (with 43-55mm step-up ring).It's a great lens, but lens flare is a problem. This hood took care of that for me."
4,This was a gift...,This was sold out everywhere when it was first released several years ago. Nice to find it at a good price online.
5,A brilliant wake-up call,"If anything can get us out of the delusional straitjacket that is conventional political 'thinking', this book will do it. Richard Heinberg's sober assessment is a vital wake-up call.Another, highly recommended book is ""The Energy of Slaves"" by Andrew Nikiforuk, who shows with frightening clarity how cheap energy has corrupted us."
3,Entertaining. . .,"If I were rating this book solely on entertainment value, I'd have given it 4 stars. . . it was a very enjoyable read. That said, I'm not sure I could even give the arguments in the book 2 stars. I found it particularly ironic that while he repeatedly disparages economist, he liberally quote Paul Ehrlich, who was so thoroughly embarrassed in his 1980's bet with the economist Julian Simon."
2,gloom and doom,"Gloom and doom with a left wing slant. Peak oil is real but this guy is extrapolating many trends to arrive at his version of a gloomy future. The sky is falling, the sky is falling!"
5,The Gluttonest Generation,"This book is important and disturbing. The author tries to remain fair, and for the most part succeeds. The problem of oil depletion has been debated for quite sometime, but it certainly seems to me that we're now experiencing the effects. The book is most useful in that it does a good job framing the problem, the debate, and what our alternatives are.Why I find this disturbing is I don't believe Americans have the will to seriously confront the issue of oil depletion."
5,great,"great read if you are interested in whats going to happen after oil runs out, everyone should read"
5,Well done & Provocative -- even if you dont agree,"I found this a powerful & provocative read, important to all whether you come away agreeing or disagreing with the theory.Heinberg does an expert job of summarizing the complex and broad information that must be pulled-together in order to allow for a central analysis and conclusion. He offers both sides of the arguement objectively (perhaps not without some bias, but journalistically fair). And, he provides amble references so anyone interested can retrace his analysis and draw their own conclusions.This is a Must-Read for anyone interested in current world events (ie. Iraq). World events look very different when viewed through the prism of shrinking Oil resources."
2,too much opinion,"This book contains some interesting factual content. But to get to that content you have to wade through a lot of unsubstantiated opinion and left wing drivel. It's probably worth reading if you can be alert for when the author is deviating from reality and into politics. I rate it 2 star, but it might be worth 3 stars, considering the poor quality of some other books on the subject."
3,Half The Book Is Worth Reading,"The first half of the book tried to be logical and informative. If you can get over the obvious bias and the statistical irregularities this half can be very thought provoking. The second hlaf I could not get through. The authors conclusions seemed like they were out of a bad 70's movie. While I definitely believe his conclusions are too extreme, this book made me think about the world's reliance on oil which is probably a topic we should think about a bit more."
2,Chicken Little Is On the Loose,"Heinberg, like most Malthusians, views the world as a static system and it doesn't work that way. Let's all congregate back here in 10 years or so and see what the facts are. I'll bet the ""Peak Oil"" theorists will have moved their peak date back considerably."
3,Wake-up Call,"This book was very informational and I especially enjoyed the initial chapters that offered an historical build up to our current crisis. From that point on, however, the author inspired a sense of hopelessness rather than motivating activism."
4,"Peak Oil? No way, Jose!","I am always astounded by people who strenuously deny the possibility of anything ever going wrong when they are presented with a new possibility. The emphasis here is on the word ""new"" because many have never given the oil issue any thought beyond ""%$#@! these gas prices are high!"". So you present them with the concept of Peak Oil and they instantly transform into dismissive experts. ""No way! We'll never run out of cheap oil! The geologists are all wrong. I'm right.""Based on what? Their refusal to accept the fact that oil is a finite resource like every thing else on this planet?The jury is still out on Peak Oil but only a fool will dismiss it outright and tell you that there's nothing to worry about."
4,sad but true,"In reading through the other reviews here I've seen several suggestions for alternatives, and other skeptical remarks. I would like to direct you to www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net. There you will find a very lengthy aticle, with every refernece linked, conaining irrefutable evidence that Peak Oil is very real. It's understandable to be skeptical, as this isn't something you'd want to believe, but the sad truth is it will happen and all those non believers will be the worst off when it does."
5,Better than other peak oil book,"I have read roughly 4 to 5 Peak Oil related books and I have to give this one 2 thumbs up. It's the best. I've passed the book around in my office and bought some from amazon and send them to my friends around the world. It's not a dry, boring technical book. It touches almost all aspects of our lives. I like the beginning chapters as Richard relates energy consumption to population growth and food production."
3,food tray,I purchased this for my daughter in law. She was very excited to get it along with other attachments to make applesauce. Hasn't had the chance to use it yet. It took a while for us to put all of the parts together.
3,Expensive for a bit of plastic,"I need this for the attatchments for my ""KitchenAid"" mixer, but it gets three stars mostly because of price, too expensive. It could be deeper and wider as well. Canning tomato juice and paste for a family of eight requires bigger. For such a powerful mixer, the attatchments are under-sized."
3,Really nice but leaks,"This is a great attachment if you are going to process sloppy items through the grinder or fruit and vegetable strainer. The only down side is if the item is really juicy, it may leak between the seams. I used this for making fruit nectar/juice and processing tomatoese and it did great but I had to keep a towel handy to keep things from getting to messy. The leaking was minor but enough that with the juice being hot, it could have gotten out of hand, however I couldn't have gotten the canning done without this attachment."
3,"It works pretty good, I am not completely pleased with it.",I bought this because I make a lot of tomatoe juice and I wanted to separate the skins and seeds from the juice. The juice leaked all over where the tray connected to the smaller tray. I wish the connection had a tighter seal.
5,Worth the purchase,I bought this optional accessory when I purchased the food grinding attachment. I discovered the tray is very easy to insert in place and it does speed up the process of feeding meat strips into the grinder hopper. The tray is also easy to dis-asemble and clean.Recommend.
4,ka attach,Food tray greatly increased capacity of grinder. Only drawback is that it shifts on grinder in use and requires adjustment.
2,not flat,I would not purchase this tray again . If it were flat it would work great but it is slanted on both sides so the meat that you put on it all slides to the center blocking the grinder mouth .
1,nice to have too bad the grinder stinks,nice large size. The food grinder attachment is worthless. And I love kitchen aid. But their food grinder is way too expensive and does a terrible job on not only fruits but meat as well. Sorry kitchenaid I hope you read this your product sucks.
4,Kitchen aid mixer Food Tray review,"After using the foodtray attachment. I think a better option for those seeking a larger holding area atop the grinder would be to have a replacement grinder housing with a large holding area as a one piece unit. Unfortunately I havent found one available. Since this attachment is the only thing that comes close to doing this task here are my conclusions. It does hold a lot of extra food items to grind,it snaps on very easy and securely,it gives the option of a mess free place to sit a scoop or the plunger,it is easy to clean if you dont let the food dry hard,it virtually eliminated the chance of dripping raw product into the processed food, however if you use it for runny items like applesauce with the fruit/veg. attachment dont try filling it past where you would without the tray as the juices will run through the gap and run down the outside which could get messy."
3,self,I bought this to help put more tomatoes in than the small tray. They tomatoe juice runs all over. It just sits on the other tray. It would work better if it wasn't liquid.
5,A must have item,"IF you have a KitchenAid stand mixer and IF you buy the Fruit and Vegetable Strainer attachment, then you MUST have this Food Tray Attachment. It's as simple as that. The tiny, integral food tray built into the strainer is FAR TOO SMALL to use with anything beyond a pint or two of product. If you're going to process 100 lbs of apples into applesauce as we did this summer, then you absolutely need something bigger. Even this tray was not as big as I would like, but it was big enough to do the job at hand. It does need to be placed correctly on the strainer tray, but there are stops built into the attachment to do this. It does come loose periodically, but even that wasn't too big of deal. All in all, a really good piece of equipment at a reasonable price, that should last year after year if properly cared for."
4,It is amazing,We really enjoy this product. It has allowed us more flexibility while grinding and processing. We have been able to do more in one session than before. It has reduced the amount of time we spend in the kitchen doing prep work.
5,A must have,"The Food Tray attachment is an absolute must have. It practically triples the amount of item to feed into the KitchenAid mixer. Without this, I can only imagine what a mess it would be trying to make sausage. It is simple to use and easily slides onto the main food tray. I would recommend the Food tray attachment to everyone."
3,Needs work,"Normally I like Kitchenaid products, but this tray has some flaws that could use some work. First if you are using wet veggies or meat, don't bother. This device in no way shape, or form will keep the excess juice contained. I use it for sausage making and have mixed results it. While it will hold extra meat, but any juice will run down the sides as this doesn't seal to the grinder attachement. I think it would have been better if it inserted into the grinder instead of sliding on it creating a very poor seal. Better yet, just make the grinder have a bigger tray would fix the problem. This is one of the few kitchen aid devices I don't give 5 stars too."
4,A Helpful Guide,"This book is for a non-writer who needs to write advertising or marketing for his company.The material is comprehensive and includes many good tips. A couple things to note--1. The focus is on style and construction of materials (e.g., how to put together a direct mail piece), not on grammar, style, and construction of words.2. Most of the book covers B2C marketing, not B2B.All the advice is tried-and-true. If you follow it, you can't go wrong."
3,"Some useful content, some lame content, poor organization","I am giving this book three stars to attempt to strike a balance with all those five-star reviews. Thirty pages into it I was tempted to throw this in the trash. I guess I'm just not a ""for dummies"" type and the lame humor the publishers apparently require got pretty tiresome. Also all the plugs for the plethora of other dum-dum books. That being said, I did forge on, past Jonathan's recommendation that I use my indespensible thesaurus as a doorstop, and found some useful tips, though his organization is poor. Is this worth $13.59? Sure. Will it teach you to write? Certainly not, but no book can do that. His overview of some key marketing concepts will be useful to people new to marketing communications or needing a refresher."
5,Outstanding!,Easy to read and easy to apply. I have a whole new thought process for copy on our website and brochures. This is a can't miss book for rookies!
5,Must read for students and practioners alike!,"Johnathan Kranz is brilliant!'Writing Copy for Dummies' is a very versatile book for anyone interested in Copywriting. His approach is clear, concise and complete. I have used his material in my College Copywriting for Print Classes and have also shared his information with several community groups trying to achieve some distinctive competency in their not-for-profit publications. Kranz shares his winning formulae using some non-traditional promotional vehicles. Read it. Use it. Get results with it."
4,Works as described,I used this to install a new BMW headunit into an older 3-Series bmw as a converter to the newer antenna jack. Worked like a charm.
2,"A masher, not a shredder","Unfortunately, I have to agree with another reviewer - Steve ""SGR"". We had an older Kitchenaid Slicer/Shredder attachment and it always worked great. The cones were sharp and stayed sharp and would bite you, if you weren't careful. Recently, we had to buy a new set as the white plastic piece that attaches to the mixer was cracking after years of use (no complaint about that).The new cones are not only not sharp, they were never even beveled. All of the cutting surfaces show a simple flat face (90 degrees to cone's surface) and the cones are now made of a softer inferior steel. When we tried to shred some carrots for muffins, we got mashed carrots. The parts also get stuck together and only a set of pliers will disconnect them, while damaging the parts. Kitchenaid is not the product it used to be and it is time for a successor and a better product."
4,rotoshredder,The unit would be much better if the housing unit itself were made out of metal rather than plastic. This is my second time replacing the unit because of a crack in the plastic housing.
1,Disappointed,"I was very excited when I ordered this product because of the potential time and hassle it would save me. I was disappointed to find out that two of the cone attachments are pretty much the same and I must have been in disbelief after reading the customer reviews regarding the difficulty with disassembling this product after use. It is quite difficult to disassemble because when you are removing the cone, there is no good way of grabbing it to turn it to the left to remove it. The first test was carrots which wasn't bad but when I removed the cone it made quite a big mess on my counter and floor. I am returning this product and intend on getting a food processor instead."
1,"This isn't a slicer/shredder, it's a mangler","Terrible product. Why?The blades are dull and VERY hard to separate from the shaft.Cucumbers and zucchini with the ""slicer"" attachment come out as mangled bits. The ""shredder"" simply liquefies vegetables and doesn't produce nice strings. Cheese has to be frozen in order to not gum it up.This had the potential to be a great product, but Kitchenaid completely blew it.The blades need to be MUCH sharper (think food processor), be stainless steel, and have a solid shaft that doesn't have to be removed.Even a $25 salad shooter got it right."
5,Review of Kitchen Aid Shredder,"I love this product, We got one about 20 years ago and just plain wore it out, it helps me be able to buy cheese for pizza in bulk and then shred and freeze. My family wouldn't know what to do if I didn't make homemade hash brown for breakfast and that is just a start. I would recommend this to any person who has a Kitchenaid to use it on."
4,Kitchenaid add on's,Great price well known name not an aftermarket toolWorks as deseribedsaved 50% got it cheeper than a used one on E Bay
4,Does a grate (pun intended) job but...,I wouldn't suggest putting it in the dishwasher. It's listed as being dishwasher safe but every metal part rusted after a single wash. Had it replaced by Kitchenaid through warranty process but we're washing by hand from here on.
3,Okay but not perfect.,"I have been using these for about two years now, off and on. I like to use my Stand Mixer for making breads. This attachment works pretty good for chopping up things like apples and other similar fruits. I also like sliced potatoes for pan frying. The slicers are not great for making nice flat slices but if you have a lot of potatoes, it is better than doing it by hand. The KA food processors do a much better job but then there is that additional appliance to get out, set up, and clean. I like these attachements for quick, simple jobs, requiring little time to set up or use. I would buy them again and the price is good for what they do."
2,rust on kitchenaid,"I was very disappointed when I removed the blades for this slicer shredder from the dishwasher and found that they had rusted. It was a heated dry cycle that ran overnight, and the items were placed in such a way that the water would drain off. They still all had rust on them. I probably would not have purchased them if they were not billed as being dishwasher safe.KitchenAid RVSA Slicer/Shredder Attachment for Stand Mixers"
1,How does this thing work?,"I liked the idea of it and was trying to save space on the counter but like others have said, it just turns the food to mush.Every vegetable gets half ground and half slid between the cone blade and the housing. Everything without exception. Celery was the worst. Blades too dull to cut the strings. Came out mushed celery and a huge mess to clean up.I tried the shredding attachment and things came out slices with ridges. What's that all about?So how does this thing work? Kitchen aid isn't known for making junk. This has to work for somebody and can't just work for extremely hard vegetables.There are zero instructions except the one that everyone else seems to miss about the square hole in the plastic houseing specifically designed to tighten and loosen the cones from the shaft.If you know how this works, please let me know. Ty"
2,Depends on what you want to use this for,"For me this was a horrible purchase. I wanted to be able to slice onions and celery, or other soft vegetables and fruits. This is not a good item for that. If you want to shred cheese or other firm items it works okay to great. After I was disappointed with the onions and celery I tried potatoes since I make homemade chips I was hopeful it would cut down on the work, all it gave me were potatoes that already looked chewed up. I suggest spending the money on a food processor if you want to slice and shred softer items."
4,so far so good. wife is happy with it.,"Thus far, we have had it a few weeks. Wife uses the mixer all the time with no problems so we decided to try this attachment. She makes a potato dish which requires a lot of shredding. She gave this two thumbs up as she used it to shred the potatoes this last time. Read the earlier comments and decided the issues raised could be overcome, and so far they have. The insert/rotor has to be grabbed with a pliers or something to get it to twist out, but if you are careful it is not hard. I also think hand washing the cone/slicers and immediately drying them will keep rust at bay, rather than top rack of the dishwasher. Less handy, but lets face it, you are spending time in your kitchen for a reason usually."
1,Blades Duller Then a Stone,Bought as a gift for my wife. She used the slicer cylinder 1 time and it created cucumber mush. Pay attention to the dull blades comments they are correct. Kitchenaid has NOT got this product figured out.
2,I took it back,Blades were no where near sharp. Don't buy this. It's the only kitchen aid purchase I've ever come to regret.
2,a useless piece of appliance.,Bought this attachment with the intention not to invest in a food grater or food processor. The attachment run so slow even in the fastest speed of the mixer. It took 12 minutes to grate 4 carrots and they were basically mushed. I could do not faster with a hand grater. Next time I will spend in a food processor or a hand grater.
4,Works well,"I have really only used this to great cheese and chocolate, it does a nice job but can be a little messy."
3,shredder/slicer,"It works, but much of the vegetables will hang in and outside the drums.Not the easiest to clean."
4,Just great!!,"I just bought this product and I am really satisfied about it. I can prepare saldas , cakes, french fries in seconds!!! it is marvellous.i just have a problem changing the cones because it is kind of hard. But do not think in buy this product.!!!"
2,Okay but not great,"I've only had this for a few days and haven't tried the shredder yet but as a slicer I'm rather disappointed in it. I tried it on a couple of relatively firm cucumbers and it did slice them, just not in nice uniform slices like the box shows. Some of the slices were thick on one side, very thin on the other. Others were elongated, more oval than round. The skin of the cucumbers would get caught and pull off and it would more or less just mash the spots where the skin ripped off. All in all, this product is not worth the $50 if you buy it individually but if you get it in the meat grinder/pasta maker/slicer 3 pack like I did it's worth it."
4,It works just as I hoped it would.,"This product works well. I've shredded carrots and cabbage so far, and it does the job. I'm pleased with the ease with which it connects to my Kitchen Aide mixer, although the instructions leave a little bit to the imagination. They don't mention the lever that needs to be pushed in order to release the cones, but it's easy enough to figure out on your own. The hopper could be a little larger, but it's okay."
4,Quality Product,"I have owned my KitchenAid mixer for about 20 yrs. It has always worked very good and seems to be very hi quality. I have seen many of these exact mixers in various culinary schools. I only rated the Slicer/Shredder Attachment a ""4"" because my first one did crack where it attaches to the mixer. The mixer itself and the other attachments are all very well built, but this particular attachement can break if too much pressure is put on it when pushing food through the hopper. I have found that with a little less pressure, the slicer will probably work for a life time."
4,"Good slicer too, but...","After reading the reviews here, I wasn't sure if it sliced onions well. I am happy to say that the onions are sliced nicely. I was using a mandolin and throwing away too much, to prevent hurting myself. This is much quicker and safer. I also tried bell peppers, but the results weren't as good. Some of the peppers were mushed and some were huge slices. I had to get out the knife anyway and fix the large pieces manually.Does anyone have a good solution for the (slight) problem of sliced vegetables flying about? I have to wear an apron, but would prefer some sort of diverter to aim the vegetables downward. (Most of the vegetables do go down, but some seem to be uncontrollable.)"
1,Big waste of money,"I bought this product because of the KitchenAid name. Never again will I buy a KitchenAid product or attachment. Never mind the fact that the blades mash the food rather than slicing it, but the cones are impossible to remove once they are installed and used. I have to use vice grips to remove the cones. On top of that, every time I insert the grinder into my machine I have to pound on it to remove it when I'm finished using it. A HUGE waste of hard-earned money!!"
4,Works well,"I purchased the shredder/slicer attachments when I bought the mixer so it was all totally new to me. I had never had a Kitchen Aid before. I have to admit you do have to have space on your worktop to use these attachments - it is definitely not like using a food processor. I have experimented with the different cones & discovered that for shredding the bigger one is definitely better - the small one is too mushy. I do agree with other reviewers in that I wish the chute was bigger & yes food does get in between the cone & the outer casing which makes for more clean up BUT I am so thrilled with the mixer that I will take a little extra work on the clean-up side of things. I LOVE the fact that you can vary the speed & it does shred & slice quickly. And yes getting the cone unattached is a challenge BUT if you take off the whole assembly first & then just put the spindle & cone back into the mixer, with a quick turn it will come loose."
3,Kitchenaid shredder/slicer attachment,"I bought this and have hardly used it. First of all the cones are very hard to release from the shaft. The first one I bought I thought there was something wrong with it and returned it to the store. Then when the 2nd one did the same thing I figured out that was just the way it was made. So I have often had it out sitting on my counter waiting for my husband to pry it apart. Also, the first set I had started to rust pretty quickly. I have to say I love my mixer but was very disappointed in this product."
2,A very poor design - stay away,"This is a very poorly designed accessory.As other reviewers already noted, from inferior materials (NOT stainless steel - it will rust, sooner or later)to poor performance (10-20% of shredded nuts will end up in chunks, thanks to a large gap between the housing and the blade cups) In fact, most almonds will just fall through the gap, barely scratched! Add to that difficult removal process, and you get the picture.A big disappointment from Kitchen Aid."
3,Kitchen Aid shredder attacment,"We have a older shredder attachment from 27 years ago. Reason for replacement housing was cracking but still working. We did not want to wait until housing failed. So we ordered a new attachment set.Received new set and was amazed about the lack of quality on the new blades. The new housing was very good however. Looks like made improvements on the housing in the area of our old one cracking.The blades we not made of the same material as old ones, also were very dull in comparison to old set. If this was the first purchase of Kitchen Aid attachments we probably would not purchase any more of their attachments. Blade's could be sharpened, but why should end user have to do this.Again the housing is very good and make of the same material on one of m 27 years ago, with improvements."
3,A little cumbersome for everyday use,"These attachments work well but I only use them for doing large quantities of shredding or slicing. For everyday use, I use my food processor."
3,Bought for grating cheese...,"I primarily bought this attachment for grating cheese. And it does a fine job at that - I can grate a few blocks of cheese in a matter of a couple of minutes. However, the space between the plastic casing and the metal grater does gather a lot of excess cheese that becomes flattened in between the grater and the casing. It doesn't bother me so much, as I'd rather peel off this smashed cheese than grate it by hand.I always wash both the unit and grater by hand - I haven't noticed any rust build-up, however, since the very first use of the grater, I haven't been able to un-attach the metal shaft (the shaft that attaches the attachment to the mixer) from the grater cup - I wonder if I'm the only one, but I struggled for quite a while and then gave up - I sure hope I don't decide to use the attachment to slice veggies, because it seems that the grater is permanently attached to the metal shaft."
2,I sent it B A C K!,Tried to slice.......didn't work.......tried to shredd cabbage for slaw...worked barely. Definitely not worth the hassle and clean up.
1,"great idea, poor quality","I received the KitchenAid RVSA Slicer/Shredder Attachment for Stand Mixers as a retirement gift and used it for the first time yesterday. Although the idea of it is great, the quality of construction is very poor. The cones themselves have blades that are not sharp enough, and the removable shaft metal finish flaked off into the food!!!! UNACCEPTABLE. As a result, I ended up tossing out tainted zucchini and hand grated it instead. A food processor would do a better job for sure. Also, the shaft is impossible to remove without pliers unless you leave the attachment in the machine before removing the shaft. TERRIBLE PRODUCT."
2,Returned it & purchased something else.,"The hopper is an improvement & designed well for both wide and narrow items.With fresh crisp vegies I still was not impressed enough to keep the slicing grating kit I purchased & returned for a full refund.New modern slicers & graters should sharp enough to cut ok. My kit did not perform well at all.Light will reflect off a dull cutting edge,it's as simple as that.A dull cutter will make any electric tool motor work harder than it should.Did I just buy an oddball set of cutters?Nope! A sales person opened another brand new box and the slicers were dull.The shroud attatchment gets stuck easily in the mixer until it's inserted and removed a few times. A drop of cooking oil helped that. My grandma would put a drop of cooking oil on the bronze bushing to lubricate & prolong its life.Cutting foods the same length & no taller than the hopper improved performance a little."
4,Very handy,These attachments do a lot but for the price I would like them to do a little bit more. And they are a liittle awkward to attach but not big deal.
3,akward,It works well but it is a pain to clean. It is really great when ou have to grate or slice a large amount of cheese or veggies. Shreds a pount of cheese in no time at all. Not really worth the clean up if you aren't doing at least a pound of product.
1,a very lousy slicer/shredder,"the kitchen aid slicer/shredder is a really poor appliance.I gave away my old one which worked great for over 35 years and boughtthe new one . The cones are not sharp enough to do anything but beat something upif you can add enough pressure to force it against the blade. You need to be tall enough to dealwith the fact that the very aggravating part used to press the vegetable (or cheese) is in 2 partsand very uncomfortable for someone who is not tall.You must press very hard to get a result which is then going to be bruised more thansliced or shredded.If you can find and old one at a garage sale ""better snap it up"". I will be looking for one."
3,A food processor will do a better job.,"I tried using this to chop up onions, green peppers and garlic with this for sofrito. All I can say is that I ended up running to Wally World for a food processor. The food kept getting jammed up and much of it wouldn't even chop and got wedged in between the metal chopping cone and the plastic casing. I also had to use the larger shredder size because the smaller one didn't do much of anything. It might just be the veggies I was chopping but it kind of defeats the purpose if there are certain things I can't chop with it. While it's nice to have versatile attachments for such a great machine, this one is not one of the better ones. Hopefully it will perform better on other veggies or cheeses."
3,Shredder attachment for kitchen Aid Mixer,"We use the mixer mostly for baking. We got the this attachment to enhance the machine. As the previous person says, it can be a pain to use. You're food processor is better at most functions(as mentioned). I mainly use the slicer for grading Italian cheese. I like the shredded effect over a ""saw dust"" effect."
4,Great Product!,Bought this for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She used it several times while I was visiting. LOVED it! Now I want one for my own mixer!
1,Disapointment,"Customer Service Manager,I bought the KitchenAid RVSA Slicer/Shredder Attachment for Stand Mixers for our daughter as a Christmas gift. It should have 4 different attachments, instead two of the attachments were the same, this is a quality issue wrt your quality control, you should have complaint this issue to the manufacture (KitchenAid).Our daughter does not live in United State, we've shipped to them last Christmas, it would cost us more in postage if we have to ship back and forth between 2 country.KitchenAid RVSA Slicer/Shredder Attachment for Stand MixersRegards,"
5,RVSA,"This is another piece that my Mother had to have for her KitchenAide. It did the job, though, and we had wonderful orange and cranberry relish for Thanksgiving."
4,Works great but not easy to clean,"It works really well. I shredded a log of cheese in 30 seconds with it. I also sliced a cucumber in about 10 seconds. I like the variety of cones to get different type of shreds and slices. I also like that it is very easy to assemble and dishwasher safe.However, the cones themselves are made of a fairly rough metal, which feels industrial, but more importantly, that is difficult to clean. I put the shredding cone in the dishasher after shredding some cheese and it did not wash well. I had to let it soak and then wash it by hand, and it was not easy. I think that the only way for it to wash well is to wash it right away.But overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
2,Please stop me! I just need to grate some cheese!,I can't believe how poorly this attachment works. I love my stand mixer and use it all the time to make bread. The other day I decided to use the shredder attachment to shred some cheese for the pizza I was making. My goodness it took a long time to shred! I tried different blades and they all seemed like they were dull or something. My wife came in and asked what I was doing. She said she had the same problem trying to shred beats for borscht. The blades just don't seem to want to shred. Maybe mine are dull or something but I really can't recomment this product to anyone. Get a good hand shreader for a few bucks and save yourself the hassle.
4,This is a great tool...,".. but I did not give it 5 stars because it's not easy to attach it and deattach it. Otherwise - great idea, great price, great results!"
2,Save Your Money!,"I just got this item, but I don't like it. I love my mixer, but skip this. It is difficult to assemble/disassemble. It is messy and spatters what you are shredding. I am hoping it will be good at slicing something, I don't know yet. Overall, it is much quicker and easier to use a cutting board and a knife. Save your money!"
2,This Could Be So Much Better,"In my RVSA (and all the others that I've looked at in stores) the blades have been inconsistently dull (never remotely sharp, just some more dull than others, even on the same cone) and inconsistently offset from the cone so they cut or grate inconsistently. Since they are so dull, they only work on certain firm foods. If this aspect were fixed I would recommend this product wholeheartedly. Until then If you still want something like this I highly recommend the KitchenAid DVSA which uses KitchenAid food processor discs but was discontinued in 1999. They can still be found used or even new on KA's ebay store. The DVSA works far better and on a greater variety of foods."
1,Broke my 525watt Professional 6 KitchenAid,"Used the slicer attachment to grind up cabbage for sauerkraut. I cut the cabbage into 32 pieces and fed these in. It worked for several heads of cabbage. But then it started skipping and jamming. Bottom line: it turned out the gear housing cracked and the gears stripped. This Professional 6 unit is not built strong enough to handle cabbage in the slicer. I called KitchenAid, but since it was past the one-year warranty, they essentially said tough luck, replace the gears and housing, or send it in for repair, or buy a new unit.Instead I bought a TSM Products Stainless Steel Cabbage Slicer which works great - it is a manual slicer but cuts the cabbage much thinner and more srtingy making much better sauerkraut."
4,Works fine,Good for grating larger amounts of cheese. Speeds up the cole slaw process tremendously. Seems as sturdy as the grinder attachment. East to use & store. Pleased with the purchase.
2,slicer attachments,"Honestly, if I had known ahead about this attachment I would not have bought it. It is hard to use it jams, the hook in the back doesn't want to catch. When vegetables is being chopped up, its real juicy and gets all over the place. Must be really carefull on the clean up. Just don't recommend this."
2,faster than trying to slice with a knife,"This is faster than trying to slice large quanities of veggies with a knife, but poorly made. I agree 100%! with the 1 star review by Steve ""SRG""! If you are thinking of buying this read his review first. A neighbor had just bought this so I got to try hers first, thank goodness! Doesn't work well at all. Blades aren't sharp and are already starting to rust on hers. I would only use this if I were trying to slice 10 or 15 pounds of cucumbers for pickling or some other major slices endeavor."
3,"TIME SAVER, BUT.....","i usually dont review however others give great reviews and it really helps when i think of purchasing from amazon. the slicing cups work great how ever the shaft they attach too has started to have problems. i was shredding cheese and when finished tried to remove the shaft from the base of the white feeder and it was like it had welded itself together. after 15 mins of banging on the counter and much frustration i gave it to my husband to take the power tools to it. he had to dremel part of the shaft smooth from burs that built up on it. he had to do it again after 2-3 uses. its strange but a lil headache for lots of great meals is still well worth it, as long as it doesn't weld itself together permanently."
1,Not worth the hassle,Tried a couple of times to use this attachment and each time ended up slicing and shredding by hand. The construction allows the shredded or sliced food to jam between the outter casing and the drum creating a huge mess and a lot of frustration. I own a few KitchenAid attachments and love them. But this one is staying in the box.
2,Not Happy With,"We tried these out the first day we received them and all it did was make a huge mess. Anything we tried to cut or shred just ended up a mushed up mess. I did read on the instructions that if you put the stuff in the freezer and get it a cold enough where it is hard then it performs better but I don't have time for all of that. You would think with it being ""Kitchen Aid"" brand it would be built a little better."
3,Stuck together!,"The actual shredding process works well. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the shaft fully tightened on the shredder cone, but it seemed tight anyway, so I used it. (The cone has little ridges that should be fully grasped by the shaft.) I noticed when I was done that it had finished tightening itself. That made me feel better, for safety reasons. But now I can't get the shaft off of the cone! I tried removing the cone while the housing was still on the machine, and it actually ran the motor backward; that seemed really bad for it. So I took the housing off, and I couldn't remove the shaft that way either, it's just stuck on there! I can't use any other cones until I get the darned shaft off, or order replacement shafts - one per cone is apparently what I'll need."
1,Piece of junk. Shame on KitchenAid,"The slicers and shredders are dull. It's only useful for thick potato cuts and probably grinding cheese. Other than those two things, it's a pice of junk. They also rust immediately after being washed."
1,Disappointed,"Ordered from Amazon, which was great.When I opened it up, I found that the blades were not sharp at all. I was able to run my finger across the blades without cutting my skin. I returned it to BB&B; (even though I didn't buy it there). When I exchanged it, I found that the new one had dull blades as well. I ended up getting store credit and not the slicer.I don't know why they would sell un-sharpened blades. If I can find one with proper blades, I would be happy to have it. But this isn't worth getting, as it is."
1,useless!,I tried to shred some almonds - parts of the almonds are shredded however about 50% falls out next to the grinder blade in larger and smaller almond bits. Very messy and disappointing.
3,Slicing/dicing/grating Woes,"For decades, I used a hand model with the same type of slicing and grating cups, but when the cups finally rusted, replaced it with a food processor. When my processor bowl cracked (It can't be replaced according to the manufacturer--planned obsolescence!), after much research, I decided to go this route.The device is quick and easy to install, although I have to use a pair of pliers to separate the shaft from the cups. The grating cup became seriously discolored the first time it was run through the dishwasher, but still works fine.It will not chop, so I had to buy an old-fashioned hand chopper."
1,No sharp cutting edge,"The so-called cutting edges on the attachments are as dull as can be. They do not cut veges, they club them to death. The hopper for putting veges in has a lot of slack, and the item to slice or grate can slip around and avoid being cut at all. I returned this item the day after I bought it. I'm sticking with my inexpensive food processor for cutting chores!"
1,NO stars......,"As with most things ""Kitchen Aid"" the quality these days is FAR inferior to their products during the glory days of the brand's HOBART origins.Sad, but the company seems much more interested in offering mixers in lots of pretty colors than in maintaining high standards.Is there no company in the world making quality products for the kitchen anymore?I'll PAY for high quality.....really!(Yes, I've already asked Santa for the Hobart N50.)"
1,Not as advertised,"When I used the slicer, it sure did not work on carrots. It did work well on shredding cheese.Getting the silly thing put together and then, ugh, taking it apart was difficult for me. I am 64 and my hands are not as strong as they used to be. Maybe this would not be a problem for a younger person. I would not spend the money if I knew when I bought it what I know now."
2,Not the easiest to operate,"I've used this only once to shred cabbage. It did a great job of making tiny shreds, but the unit and cone was so hard for me to attach and I don't think it's very safe. At least, I'm not very comfortable using it. I love my kitchenaid artisan stand mixer, but don't think I'll be buying any more of the attachments when there are so many other products that are less expensive and look to be easier to use. I'll probably sell this attachment set and get a mandolin."
4,Hank Haney Essentials,A good video for Novice Golfers. Don't believe it would help much for a 15 and below handicapper. But deffenitly would help higher handicappers.
5,A special DVD for a special season,"As a lifelong Astros fan and someone who followed the 2005 season very closely, I can say that this DVD does a great job capturing the abysmal start, miraculous finish, and dramatic playoff run that the team went on. What a roller coaster! This DVD is an absolute must-have for any Astros fan."
5,Worldview Fuel for the Jouurney!!,"John Stonestreet and the guys at Summit Ministries in Colorado provide a huge book for examining and embracing our Christian Worldview. Just when I thought my shelves couldn't handle another book, ""Making Sense of Your World"" has become a fantastic addition to my library supporting Rational Philosophy, Christian Apologetics, and a Biblical Worldview. Thanks!!! I'll get this book in the hands of a number of my peers! Randall Niles"
3,Required reading (College),Good information but too many words I had to look up when another word more understood could have been used
4,Great book,"Very interesting, but kind of a hard read. I am enjoying reading about different worldviews and putting a perspective to my own."
4,Awesome 80's wig,The wig was exactly as pictured after teasing it out a little. It stayed on and wasn't too itchy. Colors were great. I totally rocked the 80's party.
2,Have only read one chapter.,"This book is part of a church wide study group of 200 women. I was too late to sign up for this session so will take the next opportunity in the first of 2006. Those I know who are paticipating, like the group sessions better than the book. They are single and unattached, if that makes a difference."
1,Read some excerpts,"This book is definitely written from a very, very Christian perspective. Some people may wish to actually read some excerpts from this book and definitely read the prayer in the back before deciding to purchase it. If you like what you read...buy it...if not...keep looking. This book will appeal to a certain audience. If you are not in that audience there are penalty of other books out there that can assist men and women in balancing the feminine and masculine aspects of their own respective beings. For those who decide not to purchase this book but are still looking for something from a Christian base, I would suggest something by Cloud and Townsend. If you want something Spiritual with a respective definition of the male and female roll, the Hindus may have some very good holistically spiritually based relationship books."
4,Loved Captivating,I really enjoyed reading this book and felt so loved and admired by my Heavenly Father. It was a spiritual boost that I so desperately needed.
3,the soul of a woman,"I like the book so far and identify with the longings that most women have. I only wish that the book would teach these through usage of more scripture and less emphasis on beauty although I understand the author says that it is more about inner and outer beauty.I know that between most of my female friends and I, women today are truly simply ""tired"". Tired of trying to gain acceptance in the work place, tired of carrying the burden of the family without full support of the spouse, and tired of trying to please everyone in general. It is through these experiences that women feel broken. The cup at times feels like its running low. It is my hope that parents would educate their daughters in value of their existence on this earth. That we are not simply here to rescue everyone else. We too have souls that need nourishment."
5,It made me feel more beautiful...,"I loved this book. It took a few chapters to get into it, but once I got into the meat of it, I couldn't put it down. It honestly helped me to connect with God as a woman, and not just as one of His children. My walk has been given more meaning and direction since understanding my role in ""the great adventure."" Thank you, John and Stasi, for delving into the heart of a woman. We all know it's a scary place to go!"
3,Captivating Book,"The book is good, but goes to the extreme in every chapter when describing women. Most of the women in my group could not relate to the extremes and are therefore missing the truth that is there. I would recommend ""The Sacred Romance"" and ""Waking the Dead"" (both written by John Eldredge)as better reads than this book. Captivating doesn't go to the depths that these other 2 books do and therefore is not hitting the mark as far as I'm concerned."
2,Too repetitive,"I'm sure the author(s) could've gotten their point across in a 30-page book. It seems like they make a good point, but then they hammer on it for 20 more pages, then move on to the next chapter and go over it some more. Ugh. I'm bored already, but I'm gonna hang in there to see what blows up!"
5,Very good service/very good book,"""Captivating"" is a good book for women who do not see themselves as God has made them. It gets to real issues of the heart that are buried in us that we do not want to look at and supplies encouragement. I think God inspired the Eldredge's to give a writing that will free women from intimidations and false thinking about themselves. Amazon is great to give the free shipping at a low minimum and it was delivered fast. I gave two away for Christmas and kept one for myself."
5,a must read for both men & women alike!,"this book changed my life and the way i view femininity. i am now more confident with being a women and have actually come to embrace my feminine qualities. i love how the author mirrors these qualities with God's characteristics, because it allows you to see yourself as ""normal"" and not, as the world puts it, ""complicated"". i highly recommend this book!"
3,Captivating - Possibly?,"I'm with most of the reviews on this book. Although I found the book to be interesting and thought-provoking; I had a hard time relating the book to myself. I think that many women would find this book helpful, and I'm not discounting that fact. I feel it is written toward the melancholy and very emotion-driven woman. If you are in the market for fairy-tale like writing and woo, then you are in the right place. I will keep the book in my library in the chance that a friend may be in need of it in the future, but I doubt I'll pick it up again. Looking for something with a little more meat."
5,for every woman,"This book is captivating! Really. Well-written, each chapter impacts you and leaves you with the question, ""How can there be any further revelation?"" and then there is. It doesn't cater to the perfect woman, nor does it impose any 'burdens' on you to be one. Rather, it explains why you are stressed, frustrated and not living the life God intended for you but hiding behind the mask of dominating or desolate woman (or in my case, flip-flopping between both). Prepare for tears, even if you think you are a strong woman - God is waiting to reach you in this book and make you understand how truly captivating you are."
4,Personal expectation,"A search for your inner self, what is true in your heart as a woman and what draws you close to God. Any book that you can read which will generate the emotions inside of your heart to seek God is a great book. Research the scriptural references from your own solid ""book"" of scriptures. Reading this book can change the journey in seeking God's love to fill your heart. Then again, maybe this book won't satisfy that need for you. But it did for me."
3,"It's good, but not the best I've read","I can understand the variety of reviews I've been reading. I really liked the concept of the book and did relate to a lot of the information, but I also did see how off track it could get as well. I've only seen one review of the videos..has anyone else viewed these? I think I've decided to do a different study called ""The New Eve"" which is by Robert Lewis - I think it stays more on track and hit the nail on the head for women these days. And don't fear, just because it's written by a guy :) he's done a great job."
2,Book Review: Captivating by John & Stasi Eldredge,"In their book Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul, John & Stasi Eldrege share their journey in discovering and healing a woman's soul. There are 12 chapters followed by an epilogue, prayer for salvation, daily prayer for freedom, and prayer for sexual healing.I know this book has been highly acclaimed by many people. However, I just could not connect with it. It has set on my nightstand for months now because each time I would pick it up to read it, I just could not relate to it. I am sure there are some women this book would be great for, but I was not one of them. I would give the book 2 out of 5 stars."
3,expected more,"I was really excited about this book because a lot of my friends have read it and loved it. I am not a huge reader but I have read books that I have loved. But for some reason this one could not keep my attention. I felt like it was just saying the same thing in every chapet but just in a different way. It is not a bad book, its just not the best."
1,Old fashioned pathetic whiney tale,"This is by far the worst book our book club has read. A story of a messed up chick who can't get past her feelings of not being pretty. Throughout the whole book beauty is a central theme, every woman wants to be told they are captivating to attract a man blah blah blah. I had to check the copyright date, thinking this was a book written in 1920. The book angered me in that this drivel is what gives women a bad name, wanting to be rescued instead of snapping out of your issues and making the most of what you have be given in life. Wish Amazon had ""zero stars"" to rate this piece of trash."
5,Excellent! Very well written!,"Stasi Eldredge's book, ""Captivating"", is by far the best book ever written about Women. If you want a book that encourages, confirms, and heals your innermost wounds, this is the book. If you want a book that points you to believe Jesus is truly captivated by ""You"" as a women this is the book. This book has it all! Bravo to Stasi!!!"
5,A book that goes beyond words....,"Captivating touched my soul so deeply I am unable to find words to explain.This book has truly changed my life.I strongly recommend it to ALL--no matter who, where, when, why, how you are presently in life."
5,The best book ever,This was the best book I have ever read. It truely gives you an iner look at how much the Lord love his Woman and it is back up Biblicly.
4,Looking forward to having a deeper relationship with God,"Very informative, and I definitely got a lot out of it. I'm looking forward to reading another of their books!"
4,Life-Changing,"This book had a profound impact on my spiritual life. Who knew that God was so romantic?!! I highly recommend it to every single woman ever, especially teens who are searching for meaning and purpose. Some Catholic women may have a hard time being fed spiritually by Protestant material (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but I am a devout Catholic and I was very much inspired. There is no polarizing material contained in the book nor anything that goes against Church teachings (as far as I remember). All in all, a great book for any denomination."
4,Too close to home?,"I am having a little trouble getting through this book and I am wondering if it is because it isn't as good as his other books, or if it is exactly as good - and hitting too close to home!"
2,Psychological and Feministic,"This book is moderately good. I realize that there is a market for it. However, I find it highly psychological and feministic. The Scripture that is being used, in my opinion, is misinterpretted to fit the feministic perspetive. Let me say that I have known some good people who rave about the book."
5,Every woman should read,"Enlightening, scripturally sound, fresh ideas of the potential of a woman's relationship with God. You will laugh, sigh, cry, feel blessed and empowered. A must read for women (and the men in their lives). A great companiion to ""Wild at Heart."" I am very grateful for the Eldredges' work."
1,Utterly inane.,"The mystery of a woman's soul is mysterious.The beauty of a woman's heart is beautiful.God loves your mysterious soul and beautiful heart.Oh, and did I mention that your soul and heart are beautiful and mysterious?There. You've just finished reading Captivating.Well, almost. Go rent a bunch of the most banal Hollywood blockbusters - like Titanic and Braveheart - and memorize the lamest lines of dialogue. For your final task, forget that you're a grown woman and regress into the dopiest 12-year-old you can imagine. Say things like ""Daddy, watch me twirl around!"" and ""Daddy, aren't I the cutest littlest princess ever?"". Try not to gag.There. You're done.Now all you have to do is wait for a man to come get you so you can ride behind him on his Adventure Horse ...while you fantasize about making out with Jesus.Now doesn't that sound just captivating?"
4,Insightful,"Whle there are parts of the book that are rather slow, there was also some ""AHA"" moments for me. I love the chapter on Romance, and how they show that God too is our romancer of our hearts.I think it's a great book and worth reading."
2,Not so Captivating,"I do not know whether it was because I had just come out of the Bible study - Do you Think I'm Beautiful (Angela Thomas) that I loved, but I got nothing out of this book. I bought the book and then went and bought the journal. I couldn't even get 1/2 way through the book. It wasn't interesting or attention grabbing. I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on the journal. 3 other women in my life group said the same thing about the book and they hadn't taken the other class that I did before they read it."
3,yet another women's devotion,"I thought I liked this the first time I picked it up, but I have yet to pick it up again. Nothing beats just reading the Bible!"
2,Captivating a woman's soul,The book captured me at the beginning but towards the end I lost interest. Overall it is a good book and glad that I read it. She has a lot of great points.
1,Psychology - Not Scripture,"For those wanting a pop-psychology quick fix to the complicated heart of a woman, maybe this book is for you. But if you're looking for biblically sound answers to the questions you have as a Christian woman - STEER CLEAR! While there are parts of the book that have merit, you have to wade through so much false teaching to get to the good stuff. You have to ask yourself - is it really worth it? The answer is ""no"" in my opinion, and my Pastor agreed. For those whose desire is to search the Scriptures for your answers I would recommend Beth Moore's ""Breaking Free"" or ""A Woman's Heart, God's Dwelling Place"" God Bless You."
1,I really tried to like this book,"I bought this book because my husband really enjoyed ""Wild At Heart"". I thought ""Captivating"" would be a ""Wild At Heart"" for women and I was wrong. I really tried to like it and even read the book twice. I first felt uncomfortable how they try to relate Jesus as your lover. I get the concept, but the way they explained it was too weird for me. Then I started researching the verses they used and found most of the verses are taken out of context to meet their examples. I strongly urge you to look up the verses in the Bible and compare them to how they use them in the book. Then there are parts where John jumps in and speaks on how/why women act. Maybe it's just me, but not even my husband can figure out how I feel about myself, especially the root inner feelings. I really wanted this book to be a good one. Too bad."
5,Inspiring,"I really enjoyed this item, it was very insightful and thought provoking. I would recommend this item for other potential buyers."
5,Excellent book,This book is the missing piece in the puzzle of understanding we all search for. I highly recommend this book.
1,Let's keep this short...,"There wasn't much theology in this book. Unless you consider movie quotations and situations as theology. And what they did take from Scripture, much of it was taken out of context, like the passages from Song of Solomon. But in the end, it did kind of make me feel like I, a woman, could be used just as much by the Lord. I just don't agree with how the Eldredges came to achieve that end result."
1,Takes verses out of context,Our women's Bible study group started using this book this fall but quickly discovered we couldn't continue. The authors take verses out of context to prove their points and the new Christians were being misled. I am throwing away both my book and study guide since I wouldn't want anyone else to fall victim to the faulty teaching. Stasi herself seems to have many issues that are unresolved and if you view the videos that come with the book it is clear that the women in the group need help in climbing out of the pit instead of repeatedly discussing their difficult past (which since I am a former social worker didn't seem all that difficult by comparison to what many women suffer in our world).
1,Shallow,"According to this book all women are shallow. All we care about is me, myself, and I. We want a fairytale life based upon movies and not a spiritual life based on the BIBLE!Not all women are this shallow.Some of us want something more than a pretty pink dress and for someone to call us beautiful.I find it very disturbing how they have changed an immaculate God into someone who would be ""incomplete without me"" and how his ""only desire is to romance me"". This is a very selfish and shallow book!"
4,Captivating a woman's soul.,"The book Captivating has been given multiple reviews. Some of the reviews are positive and some negative, but I personally believe that it was definitely worth the read. The book was easy to relate to. Women of all different personalities and backgrounds still have the same yearning, to be loved and be called beautiful. John and Stacie Eldredge write with a passion to provide information to answer the call of women. Their information is backed up with verses provided from the Bible that show the reasons why God put women on this earth.The only thing that I had a hard time liking in the book was the beginning. I felt that the beginning was very hard to engage myself in. Once the reader moves past the opening, the rest is very informative and enjoyable to read.I recommend this book to all young-adult women. Reading this book applied to my life in many ways."
5,Great Author,Will continue to look for more books by this author. I love the writing style in all of his books. Will pass this on to others since it was so helpful to me.
4,good book,"I am reviewing this book for the publisher, Thomas Nelson. The book is called Captivating, by John & Stasi Eldredge. I really enjoyed reading this book. It was written well and a quick-read. The perspectives were fresh and interesting. The book would be of interest to most women, but especially to those with rough backgrounds and/or painful upbringings. I would recommend it to a friend. I was inspired by the authors to unveil my heart to God and fully delve in to my relationship with Christ on a deeper level."
3,Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge,"Captivating: Unveiling the Mystery of a Woman's Soul by John and Stasi Eldredge is essentially about uncovering the deepest desires of a woman's heart. I can remember many of my friends and classmates going crazy over this book when it first came out a few years ago, so I was excited to finally check it out for myself. Maybe my expectations were too high going into it, but I had a hard time making myself finish reading Captivating. It really didn't grab my attention like I thought it wouldIn my reading of Captivating, I was actually surprised to find more popular culture references than Biblical ones (I'm not saying this is a bad thing - I just wasn't expecting it). It also seemed like there were a lot of generalizations. Overall, I thought it was ok - nothing more, nothing less.(Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me a copy of this book to read and review. I'm a member of Thomas Nelson's BookSneeze program.)"
1,Sprituality for 'tards,Useful ammunition for the psuedo-Christian menopausal former barfly spending time in 12-step meetings searching for a new man to re-do whatever daddy did.
3,Not excately a clean copy,The co. said clean copy and it was completely underlined-though I wasn't upset and took it as a gift from above..
1,All About Me,"I was expecting something solid and factual about women, but this is a frilly and emotional opinion that is stetched to describe the deepest yearnings of all women, when in fact, most Christiam women I know do not feel this describes them."
1,The first thing...,"The first thing in this book about the Proverbs 31 woman was a certain miss for me. If a author, christian or not, puts down the God breathed scriptures, you can be assured the book will be false throughout. This was a Bible study at my church and of course I bought the book and started reading and threw it in the trash. I have heard how great it was and it helped so many women but at what cost did it help?! At what cost?"
4,Enlighting and Comforting,"Enjoyed this book immensely. It validates and gives strength to women everywhere without attempting to change anyonw. The authors direct the reader's attention to our inner selves through biblical references, stories and history lessons. Some of the focus on religion as ""cure all"" is too intense, however, the overall message; that the beauty within each woman should not be veiled is powerful and soothing. This book is a meditation for the soul."
1,Don't Bother,"I won't take up much space because so many before me have thouroughly covered about every point, however a group of 3 of my friends and myself decided to read this book and do the study guide, not one of us could finish it - I almost feel bad donating it."
1,a spiritual twinkie,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is not theologically sound at all. It uses very few scriptures, and when it does they are taken way out of context. It looks at things more through the lens of secular psychology than a Christian viewpoint. It's scary to think that this is being used as Bible study material for young women at churches when it is not based on the Bible at all. Starting the chapters off with quotes from Bob Dylan and Aretha Franklin?? Lord, please forgive us!"
2,sel,"Was not impressed. Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited. I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed."
5,"O girls, how we long to be your prince!","If only every girl on the face of the globe knew this: knew that we guys want desperately to be your prince! Deep in our hearts we believe that the girl we love is truly a princess:'tis burned in hearts and minds from birth! We see you all as Cinderella; we see you all as Sleeping Beauty; we see you everyone of you as our darling princess. O will you let us play the role of prince, of the Knight in shining armour, and let our love pour out unto you, in many adventurous and romantic ways!Moreover dear woman, may you read this book ""Captivating""; may you read it with an open heart and mind: oh may you try and see OUR hearts in it too!(us men that is) who want very much to love you all, and love you all as true modern day Cinderellas. <:)With much love,Another ready prince :)XOXOXOX"
2,Maybe I am not like other women...,"Maybe I am not the type of woman this book is geared toward. I don't have feelings of abandonment by the men in my life, I don't walk around internally screaming ""Look at me! Am I beautiful? Am I captivating?"" I thought this book tried to take a weaker woman and build her up. It was more self help than Biblical. But, I'm just one reader..."
2,"Capsizing, not capitvating","If you are looking for a book of fluff and childhood memories dredged from your past, skim through this book. Do not link it to a Bible study because it is not remotely associated with God's truth. For a new Christian this is dangerous territory because you may see your own husband as not measuring up. Well who can measure up to God's fulfillment as our bridgegroom and Lord? I am disappointed that I was duped into buying this book because of the Eldredge name. There are slim references to Scripture and for me it doesn't measure up."
3,It didn't really speak to me so much.,"I purchased this book because I loved reading Wild at Heart so very much. I am female, so reading this book seemed like a logical step. I love what the Eldredges are doing, and I don't have anything negative to say about them at all. What I can say is that I much preferred Wild at Heart over Captivating. I didn't get near as much out of this book as I was hoping to.That said, there is nothing saying that it wouldn't be great for another woman out there. It may just be ""me."""
4,A Wonderful Tool for This Generation of Women,"We have used this book two years in a row for a small group in in our Women's Ministry. Both times, I am amazed at how it affects the women. We have had laughter, tears (many), wounds healed and a developing sense of the awesome Call the Lord has on us as His Women!!There is scripture throughout and the principles are Biblical. The important this is, the Lord wants a relationship with us! That is one of the main themes throughout. He loves us! And He has a special plan for us.It is a beautifully written book, in my opinion. I highly recommend it!"
1,Pure Fluff,I picked up this book with a bible study group and we got through the third chapter before giving up.
4,Unveiling some home truths.,"A great book for women (or their men) searching for some meaning and revelation in their lives.Whether your beliefs are in Christianity or not, there is alot to take away and make you think twice at how women view themselves and their relationship with the outside world; And hopefully this will give women everywhere some hope for their future regardless of their past, where they are in their lives or their age."
5,I found myself captivated,"Captivating was a wonderfull book that opened my eyes to many aspects of women's lives that I didn't know exsisted. The book has truely helped me to better understand women and the struggles that they go through. This is a must read for men who have already read Wild at Heart and want to better understand their female friends, girlfriends, or spouses."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed at this book. It exaggerates the issues about women.I would say, it does have a few good points. Definitely, I have read better books than this."
5,"An ""unorthodox"" book for Christian women","I read this book several years ago, but I'm going to read it again because it's such a great tool to recalibrate one's soul. If you, like Stasi Eldridge, are tired of reading yet another book that tells you to ""do these 10 things and then you'll be a 'good' Christian woman,"" then this book is for you. Stasi keeps it real, and writes with refreshing honesty. After you read Captivating, you'll understand your heart in a much deeper way (why you do the things you do and how to be transformed into Christ's image) and you will feel such a lovely sense of freedom!"
4,Encouraging book,"This book helps a Christian woman feel much better about herself and her femininity, even if it's been misused in her life or the cause of past pain. It's a book about healing and letting yourself be the woman God created you to be."
3,"Some insights, but too many generalizations","John and Stasi Eldredge have discovered some interesting things about human desires. These kept me going as I read the book. However, I disagreed with other statements that were so dogmatically made.For example, I found that I only have two of the three desires that supposedly are universal to all women. I also have one (maybe two) of the desires that are universal to all men. What does that say about me as a woman?Having said all that, I did benefit from the book. It was good to realize that most women do have many of the same suppressed dreams and desires that I do. It was also comforting to acknowledge that God has a plan to develop me as a person by using the struggles and even the things which have brought me shame in the past.I am glad that I read this book and I would recommend it to others, but would suggest that you use some discernment when you read it"
3,"Read, but with caution","A lot of people rave about this one. It's good, but I think it can be dangerous for younger girls to read. It focuses on ""unveiling your beauty"" (being vulnerable, etc.) as a woman, but that should really be saved for the right man, not just a middle school/high school crush. It can probably be tempting for girls to want to do that prematurely. Also, it can be kind of heavy at times, might not be right for all middle or high school girls. As for the way it talks about femininity and being a woman, I did enjoy those parts. Some of them are beautifully written and I strive for grasping my true femininity. I guess I just didn't love the WHOLE book as much as other people."
5,Captivating...,"I loved this book. I felt like the Proverbs 31 woman was portrayed as delightful, attainable, and desirable. I also have a new found understanding about why women are the way we are. I love the story of love and longing that is described between God and his daughters that he has created. If you have a daughter, wife, or mother then you should read this book."
4,Understanding a Woman's Captivating Heart,Very Good Book.Have read it several timesHelps to understand women a little... lolDon't know they can ever be fully understood... only loved.
3,A little over the top for me,"There's some truth here, and this book has helped me to delve into some of the reasons behind my own inner voices, so I didn't hate it, but it's just a little too effusive for my taste. This book would have you believe that every woman ever created farts rainbows. haha!"
5,Worth the read,"This book has proved to not only be very insightful, but very emotional. It made me think about things I thought I had resolved many years ago. The information is very essential in understanding who we are as women."
5,Captivating: Unveiling the mystery of a woman's soul,"I have given this book as a gift to at least seven female friends and family members now because it is something every woman needs to read. It is very clearly and simply written so that anyone can read and appreciate the essential truths involved and relate to the authors and the examples they use from everyday movies,songs,poems,and experiences. It is one of the few books I have read that I can truely say changed my perception of a real christian woman, myself, forever."
3,"worth skimming, but doesn't live up to the hype","I think that there are some good points in the book, and I think it was worth my time reading it, but I also think it can wax on and on with superfluous language and can make naive points very emphatically. I disagreed with a lot of points they make, but then I also took away some new insight.If you are looking for excellent books on men and women, try For Men Only and For Women Only by Shaunti Feldheim and her husband. They are based more on research and study rather than the thoughts, feelings, and best guesses in interpretation by the Elderidges."
4,Works well!,"I'm using the counter at work to tally phone calls (minimum per day target). It's working wonderfully. I don't actually have it mounted to my desk, although there are holes and screws to do so, and it's still stable. For the money, this product has worked very well. I've only had it about a month, though, so I don't yet know how long it will remain operational. So far so good."
3,Super Reader,"The second jungle book has a Mowgli that is getting older, and beginning to interact with other humans, not always in a good way. A hunter comes to take him down, for one. He also meets a cute girl.This opens with 'How Fear Came', where Shere Khan tells how conflict came to the jungle."
4,Wonderful book (a tad incomplete),"Don't know how I got to 38 without reading 'The Jungle Book' and 'The Second Jungle Book'.Small complaint: this version does not have Kipling's poems, just the prose."
2,Not as good as the first.,"It had less stories about Mowgli and some were so confusing, I didn't even understand them. Won't be reading this one again anytime soon!"
3,A rattling good read!,"Kipling wrote some great prose and poetry - timeless stories if you can just get the Disney hash-ups out of your mind. ""We be of one blood, ye and I!"""
5,Childhood friend,This book is like an old friend from my days as a kid. It is a great way to kill time and makes for a great adventure.
5,Essentials of the BSS/OSS industry,"It's the only public published book on BSS/OSS industry i can find. Reading all TMF's documents is a big challenge, and reading this book is easier. It tells almost every key concepts about TMF's NGOSS program. I strongly recommend this book to everyone seting his/her career on OSS industry."
5,"Precision 2"" Flared Port","Not the cheapest port but defiantly the best, no air noise or port resonance at any volumebuild quality is great, they were bigger than expected for 2"" ports thoso make sure you have enough space between your drivers or binding post and the box edge.Also, both flares are larger than the mounting hole, so once you assemble it through the hole.you won't be able to take it back out."
4,Nice Leather,"Exactly what I imagined when ordering. This leather passport cover is perfect for protecting your passport, while making it easy to flip open during inspections. Low price...quality product. Don't waste your money on more expensive products."
4,passport,Happy with the cover you do have to put your passport in up-side-down but otherwise it is great and what I wanted.
5,Excellent quality and protection,"Fits my passport like a glove. Kinda gotta bend the passport a tad when first sticking it in, but once its in, it stays in, looks great, stays protected."
5,Great product! + Fast Shipping,"I am always weary of purchasing items that I can not use my prime membership with, because I have had bad experiences with shipping, but I received my passport cover promptly; took 2 days, so equal to prime shipping!!!As far as the product! Out of the box, the leather smelt great! The leather looks great too! The only even somewhat negative thing I can say is that the leather is not thick, or plush, like I am used to with ""fine"" leather goods. However, for the price, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.Lastly, my passport cover DID have numerous card slots! Just wanted to add this, since another reviewer stated theirs did not. Mine did! I can not wait to use this during my cruise next week!"
4,Great product!,I bought this product for my husband who travels very often. He loves all the space available for his shot record and visas that are needed for him to travel. He does not have to pull his passport out and drop all these needed documents any longer!
2,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware. This passport wallet is described as having card slots in the product description and even on the paperwork that came with it. This is not true! It does not have any card slots. The quality of the wallet is very nice. However, you will have to carry your cards in some other way. If an item is described as having features as a main selling point, it should have them."
3,ripped,The inside where the cards are held ripped out after putting cards in. Item isn't too sturdy or durable.
4,Much easier to get through customs,"I purchased two of these passport holders. They worked out great to hold our passports, credit cards for airlines, and our id's.Definately Recommended!"
3,Passport cover different than described,"The cover is acceptable. I gave it as a gift, and it was received with luke warm enthusiasm. It does NOT have ""pockets"" for credit cards, it has a useless flap to hold papers inside the front cover. Nothing on the back cover."
2,Does not fit on track,"We have a Bachmann HO train and track, this piece just does not fit the track if you have an E Z fit track system."
2,Not what I was expecting,I was expecting a better constructed piece. Signal lights don't stay straigh and are loose. The crossing based glued crooked.
1,Disappointed grandson,"My 8 year old grandson wants throw it out even if it is from Santa. The crossings do not fit securely in their slots & the gates do not stay up. The product is cheap & flimsy. Unfortunately I've misplaced the purchase document or I would return it. Oh well, live & learn."
4,"Entertaining, lightweight fun, especially for Anglophiles","Congratulations to Penelope Hughes-Hallett for coming up with a novel way to put together a book of historical subjects and reference--by narrowing her focus to one particular dinner, and the people who came to it, she can actually find more insight and give us a broader picture of her multiple subjects than if her canvas, like one of Haydon's, was big across as the River Thames. Haydon emerges as a provocative, vain, loveable and talented man with an incorrigbly high opinion of himself, a sort of rogue, but a heroic Englishman in the best sense. As other reviewers have noted, William Wordsworth--not usually a sparkplug of fun or dynamism--comes off terrifically well, perhaps he was a man at his best with a tableful of male peers and far away from the women who perplexed him so. I hope other cultural historians pick up on Hughes-Hallett's ""meal"" method and soon, perhaps, we will have an ""Immortal Lunch"" or ""Breakfast"" too."
5,my 20 month old's pick - 1st time mom at 44,"The Foot Book made it into my son's library by accident but he loved it so much at only 12 months that I looked for other 'body part' books by Dr. Seuss. The Eye book has elicited similar interest on a more 'thotful' scale. He turned to me a week after the book arrived and said 'wink eye pink eye'. Oh the wonderful sights the little boy and his pink rabbit see with their big, buggy eyes. And the inevitable 'hooray, hooray, hooray for EYES' ending continues to captivate my busy little boy who takes this book to his favorite spot when he needs to be quiet for a while. Of course, we now have the tooth book and the nose book en route for a long airplane ride."
1,Cheesy Packaging,"If I had only known...I should have read the reviews BEFORE buying. I love all 3 movies, no complaint there, and the toy box is really cute but putting the disks in foam is tacky. I'd rather have the cases. Oh, well..."
2,"Great Blu Rays, DVDs Not so good...","I just got a bad surprise when I realized that none of the DVDs of this Amazing Box set, were dubbed and no subs were included. It's a little expensive for not to have them included. I just got a blu ray player on my living room, and my 2 years old little daughter wanted to watch the film on the bedroom, in wish I only have a dvd player, the DVDs on the box are only in English. She cant understand anything of english yet.What a pity."
5,"Good for the $$, Good for the kiddos (and kiddos in us all)","Wish it was a combo with the DVD, but then again I am too cheap to spring for that. Assuming we will always have a blu-ray around, this is great. Wish it was standard practice to couple a download with a blu-ray since you can't RIP em like you could DVD. Movies are second to none. If you don't like Toy Story, you are pretty lost when it comes to parentally-tolerable kid flix. 1 is good, 2 is OK, 3 is top notch."
4,Lots of bang for the buck. Awful packaging,"For $50, I got all three Toy Story movies on Blu-Ray, all three on standard DVD, plus digital copies of all three. Now, my little dude can watch whichever he wants on iPad or iPhone, we have the regular versions in small tv, and the blu ray versions for the home theatre. For $50.The packaging is abysmal and disappointing. It looks clever at first, but its next-to-unusable and highly unpractical. This is a five-star collection in one-star packaging.Then again, the awful packaging is maybe why it's only $50? :-)"
3,Toy Story Blue Ray Trilogy,"While the Blu-rays were excellent, I did not like the hocky packaging. Will probably throw away the ""wagon"" and put the discs in a notebook."
4,Great movie and box set....,This is great the only problem with this is the movies come in cheap cardboard seperaters. other than that its great for the kids cuz the digital copies come in handy when were at the doctor's office or on a long road trip....
4,Love it!,"I absolutely love these movies and when I saw that I could get this set including blu ray and normal disc's I though it would be wonderful, and it is. I have the blu rays in the house and the normal discs in the car for portable DVD player for those long trips. The only thing I can fault with the product is it is really not kid friendly. The discs are just placed in polystyrene and so very easy for small children to get their hands on. I have had to put it up high to avoid disc being spread all over the house and ruined."
3,A little disappointed,"I was also so excited to get all three in a gift set. However, when I received, it was a cheap looking cardboard box holding the dvds. It would have been a much better collector's item if the box was at least tin."
3,"5-star movies, 1-star release","Awesome movies? Check.Shorts & previously-released extras? Fail!Efficient, protective packaging? Fail!The 1&2 DVD toybox release was better than this. I recommend purchasing the movies separately and creating your own digital copies."
1,Buy with caution!,"Many of the reviews comment on how this collection is both a DVD and Blu-ray collection, but when I ordered this from Amazon, it was a blu-ray only. If you're looking for just the blu-ray, obviously this is the way to go. If you want the DVD version, I'd recommend trying a different collection."
3,No DVDs,"These are great movies - our kids love them. However, several reviews claim this set has both the Blu-rays and the DVDs. We bought them excitedly thinking our kids could watch both at home on our blu-ray player and in our minivan on the DVD player. Nope! There are no DVDs included. These days, most blu-ray box sets include both, and we were disappointed these did not. So beware of the reviewers that claim this set includes both - it does not!"
2,Great set - AWFUL PACKAGING,"Like most of the other reviewers, we love the movies... hate the packaging. The foam insert is hard to get the DVDs in and out. Plus you can't really see what you are looking at other than the edge of a DVD. So you could end up pulling out 10 DVDs from the difficult foam until you finally find what you are looking for. The cardboard box is cheap and will most likely fall apart after a year or two of consistent use. It is also not the easiest to store due to the rounded top (nothing will stay on top). I just removed the copies we are going to use into different cases... but it feels like the pirated :(."
4,over all a good buy,"The only problem I had was the storage for the disks. The toy box holder is very cute and a good idea, but the movies are not in individual cases. Rather they opted to put slits in a foam brick. I later went out and bought a 10 pack of BD cases for around $3. After that everything is great. The BD pic is awesome and the bonus features are good to watch."
2,Not USA product!. Bad Packaging.,This item is not a USA product and would not work in our Blu-ray player. Packaging was a little flimsy. Disney Rewards points did not work either. All inserts were for the UK website.
5,toy story,"My grandchildren enjoy these cds and they watch them every time they are with me, I have other chidren cds but they prefer toy story"
2,THIS DOES NOT HAVE THE DVDs,"Really disappointed because I read in the details that this set, like many of the Disney Blu-Rays, had the Blu-Ray, the DVD, and a digital copy-- but it only has the Blu-Rays. A big disappointment in our house because we don't have a Blue Ray for the car."
1,Where the << 3D >> version,"Let me be clear, THESE ARE GREAT MOVIES, that being said the studios are doing there usual make you buy something twice trap. Namely if you want the 3D Version of the fourth movie it will arrive a few months down the road & be 50% of the cost of the presumed full deluxe collection they're offering up. Let the studio wait for your money until the TRUE Complete Collection Set is released with the 3D film."
2,Toy story trilogy,"The blu ray and dvd's in this collection were fine, but the digital copies were worthless. Would not work because they had been used. Didn't say that in the description. Quite disappointed because this was the reason I purchased the trilogy."
2,"Pixar, por qué tan tacaño para una Edición tan Sublime!","Esta trilogía es lo más espectacular que Pixar ha producido, sin embargo como es posible que las versiones en DVD no vengan en Español, es totalmente cuestión de principios de una Super Edición de este calibre."
1,Lied to!,"Like all of the other reviews what I purchased and what I got were 2 different things. I thought I was getting 3D, 2D and digital versions of all 3 movies. I was very unhappy when I got only the 3D version. I would not have ordered these if I was only getting the 3D version. I have purchased many products from Amazon with both my personal and work accounts and now I may look elsewhere for future purchases. I'm very disappointed Amazon."
2,More than needed,"I give all 3 movies 5 stars, and want to upgrade my collection to bluray. I rented these and the picture and sound on all 3 are among the best blurays I've ever seen. However all they make are these multi-disc sets (even individually) forcing me to pay for extra stuff just to get the blurays. Some people might want to pay twice as much to include the DVD or Digital discs, but I'm sure many don't. Please just release the blurays only. Disney you'll still make a profit."
2,Great movies. Horrible packaging.,It is fantastic to be able to get all three movies in one well prices collection but the packaging is just horrible. Having all 10 disks just stuck into a foam block means that you can't take just one movie anywhere and you constantly have to pull and replace the disks trying to find the one you want. It is a shame to see such a wonderful and imaginative movie collection compromised by such bad design.
1,Hold out for a better trilogy boxset,"As a HUGE Pixar fan I pre-ordered this trilogy box set as soon as I heard of it's existence. Upon arrival though, it's extremely underwhelming. The discs are held together in cheap black foam inside the ""Collector's Tox Box"" (which isn't impressive at all BTW). There's no individual case, nor jewel case for any of the discs, they just sit in foam. Literally.Also, no bonus content that's exclusive to the box set versus the 3 Blu-ray editions separately. That fact is what really finalizes my opinion on disliking this.I'm so torn. I want to purchase the Toy Story 3 standalone blu-ray, but I want to hold out even more for a ""15th anniversary trilogy boxset"" super edition that does this closing trilogy some justice for a proper retail release.:("
3,UNPLEASANT PACKAGE,"Great movies, no doubt!!!The package IT'S NOT WORTH IT, blurays come separated it by foam ... thetoy chest it's notimpressive, pretty expensive for what it is.If you can buy separately, do it guess it's cheaper"
4,Toy Chest,"I really liked this product because I was able to get all three of the Toy Story movies for a good price. Being able to have a blu-ray quality, dvd, and digital copy makes it easy to watch it in anywhere I go. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to collect all 3 of the movies. The only thing I did not like is how the discs are placed in the foam. It is kind of weird to grab the disc out."
2,bad DVD,"Tot story 3 DVD won't run, other are fine, this is difficult, because our grandson lives in Toronto and now his collection is not complete"
4,Great except for the packaging.,This is a great collection except for the packaging. Foam inside of a flimsy box is not a good way to protect DVDs.
4,Everything is there - Don't Listen To Those 1 Star ratings!,"Here was something odd when I read the reviews of 1 star ratings - no exclusive content from Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray Special Editions. I received my package today and check on the content and what I found out - all that was originally released for the Special Editions of Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray are all there. I am not sure if the comparison was the older DVD Ultimate Edition versions of Toy Story but for the Blu-Ray editions, its all featured.The packaging is quite nice - cheap cardboard I doubt it. Of course, if handle with care it is durable. Still, while the placement of the disc I felt its best if its in a casing, the foam that holds all ten-disc is something I would rather avoid. The box is rather big and the extra stuff which was stuck on the box is rather annoying.If you love Toy Story series and for those that have yet to own the previous DVD or Blu-Ray editions, this is worth forking out to own this edition."
2,"Great Product, Bad Packaging","The one downside to this product is the packaging. This discs come in a cardboard toy box lined with black foam. I have a two year old son who already knows how to work a DVD player, and it would be a no brainer for him to pull these discs out of the box and scratch or smudge them. While I love the movies themselves, I really wish that they would have come with cases for the discs for better long-term storage. You're probably better off waiting for a better trilogy to come out with better storage and protection for the discs."
1,Ultimate? More like Mediocre,"This is a case of having a great idea but being too lazy to execute it and give the best product worthy of the word ultimate.- blu-ray discs, check- dvds, check- digital codes, check- toy box, sturdy cardboard box. It's nice and for the price of the trilogy I won't complainwhat I will complain about is the fact that the disc are not in jewel cases or circular plastic cases. The discs are placed in a piece of black foam. Nothing really special, just slots in the foam for each and every discs. You know what this is called? It's called lazy production value.don't buy this product, you are better off just buying a combo pack sometime down the line. The Mediocre Toy Story Collection is not worth your money and is not worthy of these great films"
1,More expensive than buying individually,"If you buy all three Toy Story Bluray/DVDs, it's $65.47. You don't get digital copies of Toy Story 1 and 2, but you get cases for all three movies if you buy individually. The box set does not have any additional content so you're paying $15 for packaging and 2 digital copies...and no disc cases."
5,Love it!,"This seller has been fantastic. I at first didn't give this product a very good rating because of the sound issues on the third disc. I sent the first one back and got a full refund after have two conversations with the seller. I reordered from a different site from the same seller, since they are the cheapest for the whole collection. I wound up having the same problems but after getting on line Disney knows about it and it is a simple fix on my blu-ray player. Love this seller and their products!!"
1,Terrible quality,"Poor packaging, each disc skipped on the first play through out of the package, extreme skipping. Good price goes a long way to fool you. Don't fall for this rip off."
2,NO SPANISH :(,"No estaba especificado que idiomas incluía, y supuse que el español sería algo estándar en USA. Pues no. Viene en Polaco, Hindú, etc ... y no viene en español. El error fue mío por comprarlo sin estar seguro. Tengan cuidado cuando no dice en que idiomas viene, tal vez no venga en español."
4,Works great on PS3,"I had no skipping issues on any of the 3 discs using a new PS3. 3D is average, but adds to the overall enjoyment. No extras and only 3D Blu-ray discs...so know what you are getting before ordering."
1,Digital Copies Included On This Set But Not on Individual Releases.,"I hate to be the guy who rants, I always frown when I read a rant because it feels kinda stupid.Ok, the point.When the Blu-Ray releases of the Toy Story 1 & 2 were released earlier this year, it did in fact seem odd to me that there was no Digital Copy placed in the sets as most of other recent Pixas releases did. I still bought the sets, knowing that eventually OF COURSE there would be a trilogy set released with collactables and special features like always.BUT, to hold back the digital copy, which is almost a given with most blu-rays nowadays, for the special boxset, is just mean.Ugh.500 stars for the movies, 1 for their strategies.I'll still probably buy this set anyway :D"
1,Worst Packaging EVER!,"Of course the movies are great! That's why you're here looking at this, because you've already seen the movies and know how wonderful they are.Now that we've established that, go buy the movies individually. I can't even begin to describe how bad the packaging is. The packaging is hard to store, hard to get movies out of, and hard to put them in. It's just 10 slots cut into some foam, so you don't know what disk is what without handling them all. They are a pain to put back into the case because of the way the foam is cut. And, to those that want to keep your disks in good condition for years of watching pleasure, you can't remove the disks without handling the face of them, so they will wind up with all sorts of fingerprints and skin oil on them.I have many trilogies, collections, and sets of movies, on Blu-Ray and on DVD. This is hands-down, by far, the worst packaging of them all."
3,Poor packaging,"I purchased this set because it included all 3 DVD's and blu-rays which is what we wanted. I don't like the packaging that they came in. The toy box is a cute box, but it will definitely not last. I almost wish I would have purchased the individual blu-rays because at least the discs would be protected."
4,Toy Story Box Set,I love this box set but I wish it came with a better storage for the dvd's. It's very bulky and I was not a fan of that. But that's my only complaint. (:
5,Ultimate indeed!!!,"I am reviewing this on the movies and the box set itself. The movies are obviously great and look even better on blu-ray. All 3 of these will be timeless classics.I also enjoy the toy box that they come in. I always like neat packaging anyway and this was a smart way to handle 10 discs in one box. I don't know how it will hold up in the long run, but for now it seems to be ok.This was a great ""gift"" for my son, even though the entire family has enjoyed them!!!"
3,This one you gotta have!,"This Cd is full of music for the one that wants to have some fun dancing,if your ready to let the night go by with some dancing,then this is surely a great investment"
4,Loved it.,"I loved the book. It did get a little slow and I skipped over a few words now and then, due to some of the words just kept repeating it self in my opinion. I enjoyed all 3 books and would love to read more of her stuff."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"This repackaging of three older novels by Grahm was disappointing. Her more recent novels, such as Tall, Dark, and Deadly were a fun mix of romance and suspense. That's what I expected when I picked this book up. Instead, I found three formulaic love stories. The so-called suspense in each was hardly worth it. The chemistry between the couples was nearly non-existent. Out of the three stories, the best was the middle one, starring Wendy Hawk and Brad McKenna. Though the plot was predictable, (of course he was going to fit in to her world and of course his love would make her forgether dead husband) it was the best of the three. The connection between the characters (they all come back in Borrowed Angel, the last of the tales) is cute- it is sometimes nice to catch up with old characters. All in all, not terrible as a diversion, but not the best romance novel around."
3,Interesting,"Night Heat is three complete novels in one book. I love it when author do this. I would never have paid for all three books separately. The first and third stories were great and I enjoyed them greatly. I was a little disappointed in the second one. It tended to drag, and I didn't much care for it. It does however tie the other two together. If these were separate books, I would have stopped at book two becuase I would have figured book three would be more of book two. I think the first and third stories make this book worth your time."
4,So and so,"The movie was interesting and great to have for road trips, but when I was watching it, My DS power light went red and my charger light (No charger in there) was orange and the sound started blaring, wich scared me. The movie was good, but the graphics were sketchy and the sound was off. I'd give this a 7/10."
5,Suprisingly good,"Bought this one to see what quality was like. It was pretty good, the kids think it's cool to watch their own movie. Still not as good as a protable DVD, and they have really compressed film!!"
2,Video Quality bad,The Video quality of this is very choppy and not very good quality at all. I played mine on the Nintendo DS and was disappointed. For the retail price of $19.95 I would save my money and buy the real DVD of this excellent movie.
2,broke,Very poory quality. I bumped the connector lightly and noticed it wiggle. I then wiggled it with my fingers and it broke. Pretty darn fragile.
3,"Misleading photo, product is what it is supposed to be.",Not the same color/look. Not a big deal but be upfront about it. The actual product is a little bigger and the color of the old 90's computers.
2,Took Over a Month To Arrive,"It looks fine, but don't buy it unless you can wait over a month for it to arrive.And be sure you realize that the Type A connector is a female. That is, it won't plug into the port on your computer."
1,DOA,"The adaptor I received appears to be dead. Utterly failed to connect my USB print server dongle.I know this:1) The printer USB output works, since I can plug a cable into it and print.2) The wireless print server dongle works, since it lights up when I plug into my laptop.But when I plug the dongle into the adaptor into the printer output ... nothing. No signal, no LED, which means no power going through.Conclusion: the adaptor is busted. Wasted a lot of my time. Annoying. (And strange, since it is a very simple part indeed.)"
2,$9 standard shipping?!?!?,$9 was what amazon quoted me for shipping handling for this product for standard shipping. Too much for such a small item the only costs $4.25
4,The Crime of Suspense,"This CD reissue is the second disc from the 10-CD boxed set Contemporary Works I. Since the mid-90s Klaus had been packing as much music as possible on to each release. Fortunately, The Crime of Suspense did have room for about 9 minutes of music that Klaus filled with two short pieces, ""Ruins"" and ""Castles"". These two tracks were originally released on a promo CD made for Contemporary Works I that was only given to those people who had pre-ordered the set. If you are looking to buy any Klaus Schulze CDs, definitely invest in these reissues. They are far superior to the originals and earlier reissues."
1,Useless,"This is not a book that will teach you much of anything. Not about design, or the elements of design, or how various design elements might be used either separately or in conjunction to evoke feelings or images.The book is broken into sections, one for each design element such as color, texture, etc. The first page of each section is a very general description of that design element. This is then followed by 15 pages or so of full-page pictures highlighting that design element. Looking at 15 pages of colorful objects or highly textured objects may be mildly interesting but it isn't terribly informative or useful.This book may be marginally adequate if you just want to flip through the pictures looking for inspiration. But the pictures are largely mediocre and too few to really exhaust the topics at hand so it isn't even terribly useful as inspiration. No matter what your needs or purpose you would do well to pass on this book and look for something better."
5,An amazing treat for the eyes,"The Elements Of Design: Rediscovering Colors, Textures, Forms And Shapes is a joint-project by Amsterdam exhibitions curator Loan Oei and Antwerp based Decile De Kegel, a graduate in textile design and weaving expert. The heart of Elements Of Design lies not in words, for it contains precious few of those, but rather in the stunning, full-color, full-page photographs that fill it cover to cover. Each photograph presents a different, majestic juxtaposition of colors, shapes, patterns, and fascinating medleys in this inspirational book created specifically to motivate artists and designers everywhere. An amazing treat for the eyes and especially recommended for personal and professional fabric-based art and needlecraft reference collections, The Elements Of Design is a beautiful and varied book sure to open one's eyes to brand new possibilities for artistic creation."
1,Pathetic little rehash of a manual,"Sean Baker has done the obvious thing: As users are desperate for books on Orbix, why not reuse the Orbix Users Guide and write a book? It is purely a rehash, so unless you have a pirated version of Orbix without the manuals, its worthless. Whole paragraphs are identical (whole chapters, I'd say), No ""dirty"" tricks (And they exist, trust me) (Or hire an Iona consultant, they are quite good), nothing about name services, nothing advanced... Suitable for college students, not for professional developers or architects (Oh, by the way, it needs an update). A waste of money and time..."
2,A rehash of the manual.,"A rehash of the manual. If the IONA manual isn't clear neither is this book. Topics are not discussed in enough detail. For example, naming services and narrowing. It is better than nothing, but only slightly."
4,Labor Required,"This product works great, attached to the front of your mixer stand. The only negative for me is the you have to push the lime, lemon etc against it firmly, then turn on the machine. If you are doing several, it requires a lot of shoulder work, and then vibrating from the machine right up the shoulder. If you have any shoulder issues or would like fresh juice on a regular bases, consider another choice, if you want to juice one, use a reamer!"
3,KitchenAid Juicer,"I had a choice of buying a regular juicer or this for about the same price. I thought I could save kitchen space buying this attachment, but it's not big enough for grapefruit. You really have to move the fruit around to get all the juice. I wish it came with a larger reemer for the larger citrus fruit since grapefruit is usually what I juice."
4,Pleased with Juicer attachment,"I have only used this a few times, but so far it seems to work great. I only gave it 4 stars just because I have to hold the fruits carefully or they slip away from me because of the angle, but once I got used to it, it was no problem. I love all of my kitchenaid attachments."
4,Works fine for me -- good value,"I haven't had any problems with juice running down my arm, probably because the counter is low enough so I naturally am holding the fruit from above. It does a good job of getting more juice than I can get by hand. For the money, I'm satisfied."
3,"For the money, there are better choices.","For under $20, you can get the Black and Decker 525 electric juicer that is far more intellegently designed and simply works better than this very expensive (when you consider what it is) add-on to your stand mixer. I am as much for saving space as the next person, but paying more for inferior design/performance just to save just a little space is over the top."
3,Jucier,"No issue with getting the juice from any item. The only minor issue is the outer section should be a little bit larger, it does not capture the juice if it sprays from the item."
2,"poor design, sort of works but not really",This product is such a pain to use that you'll be back to using your old hand reamer in no time. The juice drips down your arm because it mounts on the front of the machine pointing down. How hard would it have been to create an angle other than 180 degrees? It also leaves a mess on the counter beneath it of pulp and splashed juice. Pretty useless as inventions go.
4,KitchenAid JE Citrus Juicer Attachment,"When I saw this item on a TV commercial, I decided I wanted it. Juicers are so messy that you don't use them but this looked simple and easy! The juicer arrived quickly and is very simple to attach to the Stand Mixer. It juices an orange quickly and completely. The only issue I have is that it does tend to splatter a bit and you have to move the orange around a bit to get all of the juice out. Also, there is a squeak when you apply a little too much pressure to the juicer with the item you're juicing. It makes you worry that the motor may not be quite strong enough to do the job for a long time without doing some damage. But overall, it's a great product. Definitely less messy than a juicer and very easy to clean. Be sure to keep the strainer cleaned out often during the juicing process or it will run over. Fresh juice is great! I recommend this item."
4,Works great,The cirtus juicer works great (like all Kitchen Aid products) but it's pricy by the time you pay $8 to ship it. However my local outlet mall wanted over $30 for it plus tax...
4,Does the job...,Not the highest quality piece of KitchenAid equipment I own but it does the job. The bronze bushing tends to wear on the aluminum shaft a bit. Have to be a bit gentle with it. Also the pulp catch tray tends to get clogged and after a few pieces of fruit you have to empty it. It maybe faster to strain it with a standard kitchen strainer after juicing. Overall it works but it could be better quality.
1,There are better.........,"ways to juice! Was excited about this attachment, but found it awkward to use. Slow and juice will run down your arm unless you hold the citus just right. For large amounts found myself cleaning strainer quite often before I could proceed with juicing process, can do large amount of juice with my other juicer without pausing. Used this a few times but found my small electric juice was quicker. IMHO better to put your money with a better juicer. Will give away this attachement to anyone who wants to try it!!"
3,Citrus juicer,I needed something that was faster than what I can do by hand and not too expensive. This juicer fits the bill. The only draw back is that it still takes some effort to press the fruit on the machine in a horizontal fashion. This can be tiring if you are juicing more than several oranges.
1,Broken after 2nd Use!,"This juicer worked well the first time I used it, but I just used it for the second time and it is broken! Aside from the shaft that fits into the mixer, the entire unit is made of plastic. The ""pin"" that slides in near the thumb screw is also made of plastic. I don't understand why it it not metal because that little nub of plastic is the only thing that holds the outside juicer attachment in place. Mine just sheared completely off during the 2nd use. When this happened the entire juicer attachment began spinning around throwing pulp and juice everywhere. I LOVE my kitchenaid mixer, but I am extremely disappointed with the design of this product."
4,A true time saver,"I used this attachment for the first time today, and I have to say it worked amazingly well. I had no problem with juice splatter or dripping down my arm, it's all in the technique. My only problem was that it wasn't large enough to handle my extra large ""Mutant Lemons"". I mean the ones that are the size of a toddler's head. For these, it took a lot of work to get all of the lemon juiced, and several times emptying the strainer. That said, for my normal lemons, and the grapefruit sized lemons, it worked perfectly.I would suggest juicing into a pitcher, rather than a batter bowl as I did, to minimize splash even more. I think you will be quite pleased with this product, I certainly am."
4,juicer review,Seems to me to be a good HOME citrus juicer. It is not commerical quality. But it is not advertised as such either.
3,Not the best solution,"I buy limes in bulk and juice a lot at once to make sodas and margaritas. If you're doing a lot at once, this isn't the best way to go. Since the reamer is facing toward you instead of up, you have to press hard to get all of the juice out, which gets tiring after a while, and doesn't get all of the juice. I'm not sure, but it also seems to be putting a lot of stress on the motor from the sound of it."
3,Ok juicer,"This juicer works as well as can be expected. It's a bit awkward juicing something so high up on the machine and sideways. But it's better than doing it by hand, and it basically works and it wasn't expensive. I don't regret buying it, but it's nothing to get thrilled about."
3,"Works okay, useful if you have the kitchen aid","Works nice, but the sieve to retain the pulp falls out on occasion, creating a huge mess. In addition you have to empty the sieve frequently to remove the pulp. But the juicer removes the need for an additional item on the counter top."
3,"Decent juicer attachment, but a few issues","This has generally been a good juicer attachment that I use fairly regularly. However, for large juice batches, I've noticed that I get metal file leakage from the shaft so I have to give its components a quick rinse after about 6 oranges. Also about that time it tends to start squeaking (same issue with the metal-on-metal shaft and sleeve). The splatter guard should probably be bigger as there is some overspray. Also, the position isn't ideal for juicing. Build quality is otherwise solid. I certainly don't regret the purchase and still use it regularly, but I think it could use some design-work for future models."
3,Messier than I expected,"This juicer attachment works, but it isn't as efficient as I'd hoped. I have to work very hard to get the maximum amount of juice estracted. ANd I did find that I had more drips of juice than I expected."
2,Kitchenaid juicer attachment,We were very anxious to get our juicer attachment. I should come with a catchers mask for the user! Splashes everywhere and drips all over.
2,Juicer not in stock,The Kitchenaid juicer was not in stock and the order was cancelled.Purchase price was refunded (after waiting six days for delivery).
3,Works as advertised,"This works as advertised, but I don't think it saves much work over theOXO Good Grips Wooden Reamerthat I use with lemons and limes. This attachment might be better for grapefruit though."
3,juice attachment,"I just got a kitchen aid mixer.I tried this juicer attachment, but was skeptical of the vertical design, as I am used to a horizontal kind of juicer.It works ok, but is messy and I would have preferred the old kind I used to have.Oh well."
4,Very happy with this,"I keep my kitchenaid mixer (the red one!) on the countertop and this little attachment is so handy. We buy quite a bit of citrus and when its in season this comes in very handy to juice and freeze fresh grapefruit juice. The strainer part of the attachment could be more robust and it needs to be cleaned frequently, but if you pour thru a small strainer after its juiced that will do the trick. We juice much more often because its right there, easy take on and off. I'd buy it again and again. (and, we do have a small electric juicer which I probably should give away.)"
3,juicer,"It does it's job but leaves a big mess of splatters. Because it is vertical, the juice also tends to run down your arm. Since I used this juicer to make a big batch of orange juice, the strainer was perfunctory; better to use a mesh colander over a bowl to strain the pulp."
4,Suggestions for K-A,"I've used the juicer attachment for years and love it except for the comments about the strainer being too small. A strainer with an extended pulp reservoir out the front would help, if it didn't get in the way. The extension would have a solid bottom and be ribbed so that the pulp could be pushed forward with a teaspoon to drain, thus extending the time between pulp dumps. Also, the comment about shaft wear/squeaking are valid. I have a small tube of food-service-grade grease I use on the shaft: never even thought about shortening. Very clever! Also, different-size reams for limes to grapefruit would be a nice way to sell more stuff! One more thing, K-A: how about a nice low-speed coffee grinder attachment? Mine would live attached to the mixer, as I use my Krups grinder every day, and could use the counter space. Maybe an ice crusher/shaver, too!"
4,You can't beat the power of a KitchenAid,"I've had many citrus juicers over the years, and have never been able to juice oranges as fast as I can using this attachment.Yes, I think the pulp screen is a nuisance (that's the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars). So I skipped using the pulp screen, juiced into a large bowl and then poured the contents through a kitchen strainer. Works like a charm!I didn't have any problems with juice running down my arm. Maybe because I was holding the oranges on an angle."
5,Works Perfectly,"Just what I was looking for! Works fine for every citrus fruit, including grapefruit. A great attachment for your KitchenAid mixer."
4,more than expected,"I was surprised at the size of this. Pleasantly surprised. It certainly has the capacity to make light work of a lot of fruit! It can get a bit messy, (with my first attempt I had juice running down my elbow), but once you get the knack of juicing your citrus at a 90degree angle to what you'd be usually doing, it's very quick and simple.The plastic construction should be easy to keep clean with simple detergent and warm water. I assume so long as you wash soon after use, there should be no need for rough scourers so maintenance should be very basic and with care the item should last a very long time.Certainly much cheaper to purchase on Amazon than from an Australian retailer. The price difference is mind boggling. While Australian retailers beg for business during the economic downturn, it's hard for the consumer to stay loyal when better value is available offshore.This item has worked faultlessly with my Kitchenaid KMP5 Heavy Duty Stand mixer."
5,Great Juicer!,"Some people keep complaining about the strainer (which in truth does not hold much pulp but it still holds a good amount!) which should not keep you from buying the juicer, it is easy to mount and remove, easy to clean, it is very easy to use as well. I juiced a bunch of grapefruits with no issues. After about 12 grapefruit, I had to clean the strainer about 2-3 times and cleaning is as simple as a quick rinse. Some people have found creative ways around the strainer, of you plan on juicing your whole citrus tree in one shot then you too will have to be creative since it was meant to be a home juicer not a commercial juicer but in the end this is a juicer and it juices well and I highly recommend it! Good luck!"
4,Does the job but not very convinient,"I used to use the separate juicer until it died. It was good. Decided to buy this attachment since I already have Kitchen Aid mixer standing on my counter top . Well,it works but not really convenient to use because 1) you have to push in horizontal direction to squeeze (The vertical would be more natural) and the shape of the pushing surface must be convex to use it with oranges."
5,Holy Cow this is great!,"This makes juicing so much easier! Just slice your fruit, put it in the palm of your hand and push it against this attachment. The KitchenAid does the rest of the work for you! You will want to apply more pressure to the top otherwise the juice may start to drip down your arm. The little strainer that it comes with is great for catching seeds or pulp. Highly reccomend."
5,love it!!,"This juicer attachment worked great!! I'm not sure why some people claimed it was really messy and hard to use, I didn't have any problems with it at all. I would suggest using a tall container to catch the juice so it doesn't splash and an extra smaller container to empty the pulp trap into. It's very easy to use because the stand mixer really does all the work! I'm very happy with this purchase!"
3,Ok juicer,"The position is a little unusual and it gets the job done, but the reason I only gave it 3 stars is because after only one use the plastic where the screw hits is so soft that it caused a deep dent in it. Cant imagine it will not pierce it after a few more uses.."
3,KitchenAid JE Juicer,"This is a good product. Much easier than your standard juicer. The only issue I have with the product is that where the spindle goes in ;there can be black leakage from the spindle shaft. I have cleaned ,dried repeatedly but... still have the leakage. I do like the product;But when I have big batches of oranges or lemons I do have to check and clean the spindle often."
5,A very nice addition.,"I used to own a Braun citrus juicer, but after I bought this attachment I understand how much effort I had been wasting. The thing to keep in mind is that instead of having a tiny dedicated motor spinning the juicer thingy (that is a technical term for all you non-kitchen folk) you have this massive KitchenAid motor buzzing along. It does not bog down. Limes, lemons, oranges, grapfruit, and the likes are juiced in less time, with less (arm) strength, and yielding more juice than ever I could accomplish with my old Braun. I don't mean to knock Braun; I think they make a fine product. What we have here is the kitchen appliance equivalant of a tick (if you don't get this association, investigate ticks; they make ants look whimpy)."
2,A dedicated juicer would be better,"I bought the KitchenAid juicer attachment because I thought it would make sense to use the wonderful KitchenAid machine to juice citrus fruit rather than buying a dedicated juicer. There are, however, two significant problems with this attachment:1. The juice runs down your hand and arm and splatters more than in should.2. You can only juice 1-2 oranges before the pulp strainer is full.I think the second complaint is the more serious of the two. Last night I juiced 8 oranges. I bet it took me at least 1/2 an hour, due to being required to clean the strainer after almost every orange.I am planning to return the attachment and purchase something a little more heavy-duty and dedicated."
5,Excellent documentary!,"If anyone wants to know more (without reading) about the Rape of Nanking, then this is an excellent documentary film for them to learn about the time."
5,Nanking,"Excellent film with an unusual format. I never realized the brutality of the Japanese Army when they took Nanking, but it was gruesome. A good film for all, but an excellent film for people who like history."
4,Heroes rise,"Amid the horror- hope. A valuable retelling of the history. The history is the subject of books and other films. This is a good starting point to learn, once again, about the cruelty and bravery possible in mankind."
3,Entertainingly bad,"This over-the-top time travel mind-bender reminded me of my all-time favorite Simpsons episode: the one where Homer's toaster turns into a time machine and he ends up in the prehistoric world. Hilariously, he remembers what he was told never to do if he ever went back in time: change anything. But a mosquito bites him, he swats it, and the future of the planet changes. He keeps going back again and again trying to correct his original mishap, and we see his house in the present morphing crazily from one reality to another. This film is essentially the same plot without the side-splitting humor. Still, it has its magic moments and some unintentionally funny scenes, and I admit to finding it reasonably engaging. Ben Kingsley gives a terrific performance as the fast-talking and morally challenged head of the time travel company."
2,Failure of logic,"The premise (as in the Bradbury story)is straight forward and leads to unforeseen consequence. In this film, however, the consequences do not follow logically or plausibly. Just one example is are the primate-saurian chimeras as a result this particular time paradox is unconvincing given that primates and dinosaur/bird ancestors were already geneticly and evolutionarily separate lines at the time of the paradox. Gradual rather than instantaneous alterations to the future are equally dubious.While its OK for a film to have some dodgy logic in order to make up a good story -- in this instance it distracts and takes away from the film. Surely the budget for this film had room to employee a writer with better story telling and SF genre skills."
3,good movie 3.5,"Yes, if you like science fiction you will probably like this movie.The story is good and interesting, has creatures and dinosaurs init and the acting is not as bad as some reviewiers have it.Give it a shot...."
3,Predictable...but fun,"Very formulatic but entertaining story with well a very good cast. One draw back was some of the plot holes. At one point the two main characters fall from a window hundreds of yards and slam into a huge tree branch with out a bruise or broken ribs. And some of the dinosaurs do not appear real in the day light scenes.On the plus side, Edward Burns is a very good actor and you get to view him in his underwear a few times. However, he has a terrible speaking voiceBut over all, a pretty good movie and a good rental at least."
2,far too low budget,"bad directing, not enough money, bad CGI, and bad directing. the idea of changing something in the past causes the future to be completely fkd up is not a new idea, so why does anyone without the right amount of funds even attempt something as large as what this movie was trying to achieve. maybe this was supposed to be a comedy, but who's for certain. i can't recomend this except for those of you who are looking for something cheesy to pass the time. the special effects are up there with the Sega CD, if that gives you any indication."
2,Best way to view this film is with friends and a lot of beer,"Turn it into your own personal ""MST3K"" event and poke fun all you want. There's plenty to poke fun at: acting, effects, dialogue, etc. It's a great example of current B-movie science fiction. Future generations will look back on this one and have a great laugh."
2,Simple story changed to even simpler genric bug hunt...,"Apparently feeling Ray Bradbury's original short story of a time-travel safari to dinosaur land didn't go far enough, this extends it about 400% and adds lots of big guns, senseless chases, gruesome deaths and ugly salivating monsters. Along the way it jettisons all logical plot coherence and consistency, leaving plot holes big enough for a TRex to walk through. You'll have lots of time to dwell on these stupidities, since despite all the explosions and screaming, it's all very boring.Someone should go back in time and stop them from making this mess."
2,The Kobayashi Report,What I say about this will probably be meaningless since I haven't actually seen this movie. But I have read the short story it was based off of. But then again I don't remember it pretty well. Though I haven't actually seen it I might be worth seeing.
3,"Ok, Lots of fun, CGI is bad.","This movie was pretty good for what it was. I am sure if the company had more money they could have come up with a lot better looking story. What they couldnt come up with is a better story. It was pretty good. I feel Ray would have been pleased with the result. I mean the story is what drives the talk not the pretty pictures. They serve as a backdrop. Seriously, if you want to do better, call a production company, have them set you up with 100 million dollars and knock yourself out. Other then that these people have to deal with what they have and do the best they can. I will admit, the nitrogen guns were pretty cool."
1,Ruined one of my favorite stories,"I think this short story was in Bradbury's collection ""Golden Apples of the Sun"", and being a 12 year old sci-fi dino-philiac, I loved it!The movie was so painful I quit watching it, something I rarely do. I won't belabor the bad points, as others have done a good job, but has anyone stopped to think that that stupid butterfly was moments from being incinerated in a glowing avalanche from the volcano anyway? Geez!"
3,Good popcorn movie,"O.K. The special effects could have been better, but I did not have as much of a problem as many of the negative critics. For one thing, it's SCIENCE FICTION!! Hard to apply 2008 science to it. The acting was O.K. Yeah, nothing special. Did have quite a bit of action to it. Weird creatures?... Watch some of the National Geographic documentaries on deep sea creatures.It did hold my interest, and I am a big fan of Sci-Fi."
1,Crappiest movie EVER,I LOVE the short story....And was so excited to hear it was being made into a movie....But the movie SUCKS. BAD CGI and horrible acting. It made me want to vomit. I can't believe someone who LIKED this story let this movie happen.
2,Distant Sound of Foo!,"The source material is good. This is garbage. Stupid does not even begin to describe this mess. The viewer must wonder how such an interesting and thought provoking idea could result in a travesty of Hollywood excess and mis-management. The writers, producers and director should be ashamed of themselves. The writers especially do the concept a disservice. I avoided this until I was desperate for something to watch, and it was still a mistake. Maybe some day a good production of Ray Bradbury's concepts will come to fruition. Butterflies rule!"
2,Thunder Rattles the Timeline.,"When watching this sci-fi journey, adpated by ray bradbury's short story, you might wonder, as I did, why the movie wasn't highly publicized or why it made so little.The fact is that when it came down to TIMELINE and JURASSIC PARK franchise, it seemed that the makers of this movie wanted to steer clear of that familiarity and do some different visual effects. Granted, there are some really good special effects but there are others which leave much to be desired and lacking.The premise is a solid story which is the only reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one.In order to fully enjoy this movie you must make yourself believe that it was a straight to T.V. or video movie and not a movie that overspent their expectations."
3,Tries hard despite low budget..(2.5 stars),"Word has it that ""A Sound of Thunder"" was greatly disliked by the people who produced it, and it was shelved for a couple of years. Picking it up on DVD a while ago I realized early on the dated special effects, they are somewhat primitive condsidering how far CGI has come in the last couple of years. This film really is ambitious though, I'm talking computer generated cities with every car in the scene CGI...unfortunately not realistically so. There ARE however some good ideas in the film, and I for one respect the fact that the movie tries to swing for the fences. There are alot of creatures, and a good amount of action. The acting is decent, and the surround sound is good. It's like a high-budget B-rated SCi-Fi channel film that can be watched...and enjoyed...all depending on how picky you are about the special effects that can be distracting by how unconvincing they look. Still I give the film kudos for it's effort."
1,Bad And Ridiculous.,"So bad I Fast-Forwarded a good part of the movie, and then I gave it away to an unsuspected grateful friend. Not worth been specific; where to start?"
3,"cheesy, yet oddly entertaning","i have to agree with amazon's review; this is a not very good movie that's likeable in its earnestness. everybody, from the actors to the director and writers, seemed to really want to make a fun sci-fi action pic. I even found the cheaply conceived special effects (actors walking in place in front of green screens) to have an old fashioned circa 1933 King Kong charm to them. unfortunately, bombastic action conventions overpowered the interesting ideas from Bradbury's original story. oh, well. i enjoyed this movie and i say rent it, don't buy it, is my recommendation."
1,They just really did not get it.,"I knew when I bought it that it was a low budget, poorly acted, rotten FX but I loved the story by Bradbury and just wanted to see what they did to it. They completely missed the meaning of the title and that disappointed me. Not only does thunder refer to the Thunder Lizzard they shoot but to the very end of the written story (and I'm sure this is not a spoiler) the sniveling coward Eckels clawing through the mud on his boot and finding the butterfly waited. ""He heard Travis shift his rifle, click the safety catch, and raise the weapon. There was a sound of thunder."" That was the whole point of the story. The movie missed it. Duh! What were they thinking? Not worth the time and money and if you are a Bradbury fan keep a wide berth."
5,Science Fiction at it's best,This is a great what if theme. I had seen it on TV...but just had to have it for my own collection.You will enjoy this one if you are a fantasy/ sci fi buff.
4,Very interesting!,Watched twice... years ago and recently. It had lots of creative thought that went into the production. Good drama! Nice affects!
3,Underappreciated Bradbury,"I will be the first to admit this movie could have been so much more. The cast is decent, but certainly not great. The effects and music are okay as well. The story is great and so with it all combined you get a good movie not a great one. Anyone that likes SciFi should definitely take the time to at least rent it. Those that enjoyed movies like ""I, Robot"" and the ""Jurassic Park"" movies may find it at least reasonably entertaining. Ray Bradbury's story for the most part makes the movie. With the right cast, special effects, and music this would have been a hit rather than a decent sleeper."
1,Possibly the worst of movie of the year!,Bad acting by almost everyone (except Ben Kingsley).The lead guy has perpetual hoarse voice and a constant somewhat annoyed facial movements as his acting.The lead actress with Brit accent slowed down as the movie progressed but said her initial (and the most important) dialog at such a horrible way!I dont think this was B movie -- more like C- !
5,"Terrible CGI, great plot","The CG effects in this movie are terrible; the acting is mediocre; the dialogue is abysmal...so why did I buy the movie after renting it? The plot is incredible...look beyond the 'B' ratedness of the movie and you'll find a movie that makes your brain work...what if that happened, what if this happened...a real shlock of a brain teaser."
2,Shallow attempt to a good idea!,"I like intelligent sci-fi type movies that deal with time travel or multiple universes. This movie however has bad cgi effects, major errors and paradoxes regarding the application and manipulation of the laws of physics in the field of relativity/quantum mechanics. I just didn't care about the characters or the plot because the whole thing was just too cheesy. Overall: MEDIOCRE!"
1,An insult to intelligence,"The plot of this movie is so stupid, that not even little children will accept the events that take place here. Avoid this movie as it is so bad I actually felt insulted by it!Obviously it was made for the same cavemen that can be seen wondering about the place. Rating this movie at 1 star isstill a bit overdone. (SARR)"
1,Ugly cartoon dinosaurs,"The CGI in this movie wouldn't even be acceptable on a Playstation 1. There is absolutely nothing good about this movie and I'm a fan of this genre. I even like the cheesy sci fi films. I liked Aeon Flux! This is just garbage and a total waste of time. I did sleep through a lot of it though. Right after I found out the cartoon T-rex wasn't a joke, my eyes were closed.I see better CGI work on children's TV shows."
1,"Wow, this is bad","You have to wonder what Ben Kingsley, Edward Burns, and Catherine McCormack did to wind up in this excuse for a sci-fi romp. Based, barely, on the acclaimed Ray Bradbury short story, A Sound of Thunder follows a time travel mishap that leads to an alteration of evolution on Earth, which proves to be very bad for a time safari leader (Burns) and his crew, who find themselves neck deep in screwy-evolution, mixed up uber-beasts. It's a glorified B-movie all the way, but the sad part is that A Sound of Thunder isn't even fun to watch. The acting is terrible, with Burns acting like a cardboard cutout and Kingsley sleepwalking, but then again, the twitchy script doesn't really help them out much. Not to mention that the CGI monster effects are deliriously bad, and when you see them, you'll think your watching a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. But hey, what else would you expect from Peter Hyams; the same guy who brought us schlock like End of Days and Timecop? Avoid."
1,Dissapointing,"I really WISH that when they make a movie from a book, they would follow the freakin' storyline! ""Sound of Thunder"" is a short story (about 30 pages I recall) by Ray Bradbury, I read it in high school a long time ago. You will not understand the title until the very last sentence - a classic Bradbury quirk. This movie is so loosly related to the original story it hardly deserves the title. Bradbury wrote this in the 1960's, about the time when the first theories and ideas about chaos theory and the ""butterfly effect"" were first being put forth. What really SUCKS is that this COULD have been an excellent movie! But it was mediocre at best. Acting, plot, special FX, everything could have been better. I will simply shelve it now along with my small but growing collection of other movies in this fascinating area, 3 total now, the other 2 being ""Butterfly Effect"" and ""Frequency"", both of which were very well done."
4,True science fiction,"I saw this film on the big screeen and was impressed by the special effects and the retelling of the Ray Bradberry short story, which I read as a kid. It's obvious that stepping on one butterfly couldn't change history, but a virus or bacteria spreading a chain reaction in the old world is more possible, if you accept the principle of time travel to begin with. The movie seemed to rely on these ape like creatures as a main evolutionary change , which I think could have been improved on a bit, because other animals would have also have been changed as well. The thought of changing the future because of messed up time travel is quite frightening, especially the way they present it in the film. I liked the special effects and the acting and I will buy the DVD when it comes out."
1,Ruined My Favorite Sci-Fi Short Story,"I am a Sci-Fi fan going back 4 decades. I first read ""A Sound of Thunder"" in 1974 at age 15, and it remains one of my absolute favorite Sci-Fi short stories. This movie sucks; it is a perversion of Bradbury's great story. It just goes to show that Hollywood cannot make a good or great movie from an excellent Sci-Fi short story."
4,Good pulpy fun,"God, I love this movie. It's so deliciously lit and shot, it's got dinosaurs, it's got Ed Burns---who for some reason I keep thinking is Ben Affleck----and it's just such a fun ride. I love the changes that occur, and even if you don't buy the story the special effects are just great. I loved the speculations about the different paths of evolutions, the atmosphere, the animals. Oh, and the cast? Who cares? The only real flaw this movie had was bothering with a plot, because I was just happy with the visuals, that's how good they were."
1,As bad as it gets....,"This movie is trash. Taking a wonderful and profound work of Ray Bradbury and turning it into this muck...unforgivable.The acting? Atrocious. It was even to bad to be comical. It was almost as if the actor's had signed up to do it years ago, and were resentful of having to now take time out and do it.And what in the H was Ben Kingsly doing in this?! Good god. He is a huge talent...what was the behind this? Who knows! Just don't watch it!"
2,"Well, It Could Have Been Worse","I love Hawthorne. But of all his novels, I like this one the least. It lacks the swift action of ""Fanshawe"" (1828), the memorable characters of ""The Scarlet Letter"" (1850), the suspense and deep psychological insights of ""The House of the Seven Gables"" (1851), or the images of ""The Marble Faun"" (1860). I would not make time to read this. But then it is not quite a flop either. There is some interesting interaction amongst the characters. Also, Hawthorne does give us an important message about the hypocrisy behind utopia."
4,It grows on you. I found it to be interesting.,"This novel is filled with intrigue, mystery and romance."
4,Well worth the search!,"I like all of Jodie Davis' doll and animal books, but I especially had fun with this one. I enjoyed picking out all my friends' favorite animals and dressing them up. This book features two kinds of stuffed animals: doll-style (upright with an animal head) and animal-style (more realisticly posed). Both are very cute, and the doll-style patterns include clothing. There is a good variety of projects ranging from cats and pigs to lions and roosters. I would rate the patterns at a medium skill level, since some of the pieces are a little tricky to fit together, and they call for plastic doll joints in the arms, legs, and head. I wish the book had color pictures - the black-and-white ones do not show much detail. Overall, though, this book offers nicely designed patterns with clear instructions. If you are lucky enough to find a copy of it, you should definately add it to your collection!"
5,The best for the stiff stuff!,"This Kitchenaid hand held is the best! When I do need a hand mixer, I grab this one. This powerhouse has an automatic feature that kicks the motor into overdrive when you encounter a tough mix. I've mixed chocolate chip dough with it without a problem. I love the beater design exclusive to KitchenAid--it seems to mix and aerate the dough more than the others. Great mixer!"
4,good hand mixer,"The kitchenaid mixer works great for day to day use. It is light weight and not a loud mixer. If you are planning to use it frequently, I suggest opting for the 9 speed."
4,"Good, but, not quite enough power","I bought this one last year. I have given it to my sister and am now purchasing the 9 sp. It was quiet and easy to operate, but when beating egg whites just not enough power. I like the new beater style (thin wires), easy to clean."
2,Not enough power...,"This Kitchenaid mixer looks great, works flawlessly, but really underperforms. It's a seven-speed model, but I had to switch to another standup mixer to whip cream because the Kitchenaid hand mixer just wasn't fast or powerful enough. A real disappointment..."
1,Piece of Junk!,"It pains me to say this is a piece of KA junk. It has very poor power ability. After owning it for about 6 months & not using it for anything more strenuous than whipping cream or egg whites maybe twice per month....it started losing its electronic marbles! It changes speeds on its own & even goes to speed 9 - which isn't supposed to exist on this model!! It takes much longer to whip up whites/cream than my old Krupps model (that one still works like a champ after 18 years!! - this KA was a ""gift""). It does still run but I'm shopping for another - and it won't be KA. KA has really cheaped-out these past few years & they are running on the cache of their name....which won't exist much longer at this rate!"
1,"Poor design, inferior parts. For the way it's made? Ugh.","I've been using this mixer about 3-4 times a month for about 2 years. Recently, it began making an extremely loud and annoying rattling/squeaking noise. Called KA in MI, out of warranty. (It was purchased in 2008 and received as a gift in 2010) When I opened it up to see if I could refurbish the (cheap plastic) gears, I discovered that the filterless fan that cools the motor sucks whatever dry ingredients you're mixing that aerosolize into the front of the device and blows it all over the exposed internal parts. Plastic gear was worn where it constantly rotates against the metal frame. I really expected it to last until at least the beater eject button stopped working. (like so many others here have mentioned)I had a similar experience with a KHB25610B 5-Speed Immersion Blender. Cheap plastic part on whisk attachment snapped.I'm entirely through with KitchenAid."
5,Great mixer!,I bought this mixer to replace my previous one (which I had for 18 years!) I love it! It goes through chocolate chip cookie dough without problems. It can start off slowly which I really like. It is comfortable to use. I bought black because it was the cheapest color. This is the only mixer you will ever need.
1,price doesn't ensure quality,"After years of burning out cheap mixers I upgraded from the $.. specials to the kitchen aid 7 speed. I thought I would never need another hand held. Wrong. The lock on 1 beater broke after fewer than one dozen uses. I admit to abusing my cheap mixers, mixing plaster of paris and mud pies, but my only problem was having the motor sieze. When I spent major bucks for a mixer my reckless mixing days ended. I swear I only made cookies and cake batter, nothing that should cause the beater holder to break. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. Having had both, I recomend any cheapo over this one."
2,Not to Amazon specifications!,"I've enjoyed KitchenAid products for years so I was very interested in having the KHM7T replace my old lower-powered 5-speed KHM5DH. Amazon describes the KHM7T as having a 1.6 ampere motor rated at 200 watts. (Actually this should be more like 192 watts at 120 volts AC, but who's quibbling?) Imagine my disappointment when it arrived and proved to have only a 0.6 amp motor which rates no better than 72 watts. That's no better than my KHM5DH. I told KitchenAid of Amazon's error. As the KHM7T is sold nationally the error will occur regardless of where it is sold. Otherwise a different model number would be required.There was no problem returning it for a full refund.An August, 2011 update. Amazon.com still describes this mixer as havinga motor rated at 1.6 amps. This is a blatantly inaccurate descriptionconsidering the unit I received. Don't believe everything Amazon.com tellsyou. The Amazon blurb should have been corrected years ago."
5,KitchenAid Hand Mixer,I got this for my wife's Red KitchenAid appliance decorated kitchen. It has been one of the most used products she has. I often hear her make comments whenever she's using it as to how well it performs compared to other mixers that she has had in the past. This mixer certainly made a lasting impression.
1,Another short-lived product,"This little wonder lasted about six uses before the motor died. Whipping cream, mixing a light batter--that was all that was ever asked of it. In the middle of a simple recipe, after runing no more than five minutes, with intervals between each minute of mixing, it failed: no power light, no response to control pad, no nothing (and yes, the power switch was turned on). This is not my first Kitchen Aid mixer, but it will certainly be my last."
3,Could be better,"I have enjoyed my mixer being lightweight, quiet, easy to clean, and the slow-start feature is great. However the beater locks wear out prematurely and it is IMP0SSIBLE to buy parts to fix it. Kitchenaid would rather sell you another one at $70 than sell you a part to fix it for $2 or $3. And yes I have checked many, many web sites and the beater locks are not available there either. The reviews on the web indicate that the Cuisinart is heavier duty. I think I'll try that one."
3,You can figure out the Wattage of this product,"Just a note to help out those that are considering comparing products . In response to the first review of this product - you can always figure out the Wattage of a product by using this formula - WATTS = AMPS X VOLTAGEThe Kitchen Aid AMP output is 1.2 amps . So when you multiply this times the standard voltage - 120 volts , this means the power of the motor is about 144 Watts . This is probably the reason one buyer states that the motor is quieter . It is a long lasting strong motor - with LESS wattage than some ot the others that are probably built with stronger motors - and sometimes weaker inside parts that wear out faster .It is also a clever way for Kitchen Aid to prevent you from comparing with other products and relying on their reputation for making strong , long-lasting products ."
2,Durable But Designed To Be Obsolete,"In spite of all the positive comments for this mixer, it is designed to be unrepairable when it fails.We have used ours for 10+ years, but now the mixer unit won't hold the beaters. It is still functional otherwise, but is constructed so that nothing short of a small explosion or a secret latch would allow you gain access to the internal workings for repairs.I know, I know, you'll tell me not to expect more from a modern appliance, and that the case is designed to be waterproof, etc. But the fact remains that two pounds of motor and polymer are now useless due the failure of one small plastic part. Consequently, we'll look elsewhere for a replacement."
3,NOTE THE PICTURE CAREFULLY,"A nice mixer. It's quiet. But ... Lefties Beware! This is a right-handed mixer. The cord is on the right side. As I am left-handed the cord is constantly stretched across my mixing bowl, getting messy. Or, if I bring it front or back of the bowl I seem to always knock something over. I'm actually looking forward to a defect, so I can justify buying a different -- left-hand friendly -- mixer."
1,Where's the Beef?,"I was going to buy the KitchenAid hand mixer, because I have always found their products to be top-of-the-line. But....After studying the box, and the display model...the wattage is nowhere to be found. Not even on the KitchenAid website could I find out how many watts of power this little mixer had. All (and I do mean ALL) of the other mixers for sale had their wattage displayed...but not KitchenAid. Why not? Why don't they want us to know how powerful it is? In the end, I wound up buying another brand of hand mixer - one who told me the wattage."
2,"Often quite funny, but ultimately disappointing","I bought this book for purely sentimental reasons: I had an enormous crush on Bradford Dillman when I was a teenager. It's a quick, easy read, and I admit I laughed out loud at some of the stories, but overall it left a bad taste in my mouth. There is a constant undercurrent of disdain (and sometimes outright contempt) for all ""civilians,"" i.e., non-actors, even those of us who were once young and foolish enough to consider ourselves Dillman fans. The general mood of regret over the path his career has taken severely undercut the wry humor of some of the anecdotes. Mr. Dillman's personal life has clearly been much more fulfilling and I'm glad for him, but frankly, I wish I hadn't read his book and gotten to know him better as the rather disappointed person he seems to be. (Also, anyone who teases his wife about being unable to spell should have proofread his galleys more carefully; there are a lot of typos in the book.)"
2,Not too impressed,This attachment is disappointingly small and it takes an inordinate amount of time to grind an appreciable amount of anything.The construction is very lightweight and I don't expect it to last too long.
4,A nice add on,"This is a nice add on if you really think you will get alot of use out of it. We haven't used it much, but it was a fun purchase and easy enough to use."
1,Would not recommend,"This attachment did not work for us, it clogged and we had to switch to a manual grinder to finish our sausages. And yes, we had our meat really really cold."
3,Broke on the first use...GRR--be careful!,"As I was running some bread through the unit to clean it in preparation for some meat grinding I had planned, the retaining ring cracked and blew off in spectacular fashion! I think this should come with a warning that such an event is possible. Had I been standing in the line of fire, the bit that flew off would really have done some damage.ON the other hand, Amazon's return was pretty simple. I just boxed it up and UPS came to get it. To get a return, though, I had to buy another one--automatic returns were not possible with this item."
2,crack in the body of the attachment,"After about 3 months of use, I noticed a small crack on the plastic. It is located right where you attach the grinder to the mixer. I can't return it because I throw away the packaging. It is a nice product if it doesn't break down."
5,KitchenAid FGA Food Grinder works as expected,The price was excellent at 30% below retail. Delivery was quick. We've used it to grind venison and chicken and it does a great job. Easy to clean too.
2,Not Pleased,I had borrowed my sisters food grinder and loved it. It worked like a dream without any issues. When I received my grinder from Amazon I was so excited to grind some beef for burger. The meat was cut in small chunks and partially frozen. I was shocked to see tiny particles on my meat after grinding. I took the appliance apart and tried again. Again small pieces of metal and some grease. After going back to Amazon reviews I see several people have had the same problem. I am returning the grinder. I do not feel this is a Amazon issue but rather a Kitchenaid problem. Very disappointed. Wish I had read more recent reviews. The problem didn't seem to exist several years ago. The cutting blade on this grinder is paper thin compared to my sisters which is about 8 years old. My sisters is also heavier.
1,sorely disappointed,"I bought this grinder based on Kitchenaid's reputation and my happiness with the pasta maker attachment. This grinder is awful. I tried grinding meat for meatloaf, was meticulous in trimming meat of most fat and used very cold (but not frozen) meat. After a minute, the meat began to look like pate. It was mush. I pulled the grinder apart and found the meat all stuck in the holes of the grinder. I then tried the coarse blade. Same thing, I had to clean the grinder often and I do not like the quality of the grind. The manual said to put it through twice so I took what I did with the coarse blade to put it through a second time. If I wanted to make a meat mousse it would have been perfect. I hate this grinder and would never recommend it."
4,"Good, but some complaints","My husband uses this the most to make homemade sausage, so we have that extra attachment as well. The one thing we noticed that we didn't like so much was that when you push the meat down into it the motor makes a straining sound and meat will start slipping out through the sides. This only happened though when the sausge maker was attached. When we took it off everything worked much better, but it is still pretty hard to clean."
3,Grease does come thru.... hasn't killed us.,"I had read a review that talked about the black particles that came through the first time the past was used - so I knew to watch our for it. We ground a piece of potato at first to try to get rid of the grease. It worked ok. Mostly, we would turn the Kitchenaid off whenever we saw a big chunck of it, spoon it out, and proceed. It's just too bad Kitchenaid doesn't offer an affordable Stainless Steel option to this product like Cuisinart does.Overall, it was easy to use, OK to clean. Worth the mess."
3,KitchenAid Grinder,"Fast delivery. Ground tenderloin/roast trimmings very well. Much quicker than I anticipated. THOROUGHLY WASH and SCRUB ALL PARTS BEFORE USING. The internal ""worm"" and blades were coated in some sort of silver residue."
4,Great little grinder,Pros:Fresh ground meat and you know what's in it!Cleans up easily.Cons:The very last little bit comes out greasy - so you just have to throw that bit away (that's why 4 stars not 5).Overall:If you already have a kitchen aid mixer this attachment is great! It works well and cleans up very easily.
5,Very Useful,"This is the first mixer attachment I have purchased and the meat grinder attachment works great! It makes short work of grinding chicken, lamb, pork etc. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I only wish I had ordered it as part of a larger attachment package with some other attachments for the mixer in order to take advantage of the package discounts."
4,A great grinder without another whole appliance,"We have had the grinder for 10+ years now. Since we aren't on a farm or hunters we aren't grinding meat regularly but it does the job.The only con I would offer is that the ""tray"" that hold product waiting to be ground should be larger. Kitchenaid now sells an add on that increases this capacity"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this attachment!,"This is an awesome attachment - i've used it to grind chicken for lettuce wraps, as well as making some of my own ground beef.it's got 2 discs with different diameters...the large worked out wonderfully for my ground chicken, and the smaller is really nice to get a fine grind on red meats. if you want a really ground up meat i'd run it though the grinder twice. either way it's a great kitchen item!"
5,Works better than expected,"I bought this food grinder attachment to replace an old self contained food grinder and this is much better than my other food grinder. I mainly us it to grind my own chicken burger. It is faster, easier to clean and does a better job at grinding the fresh chicken breasts. I would recommend it to anyone with a KitchenAid stand mixer."
1,metal shavings,"Like some other reviewers, I had problems with metal shavings getting in my food. At first, I saw some ""gray gunk"" coming out of the center of the grind plate and into my meat. I disassembled, cleaned, reassembled, and ran the grinder dry to find out what was happening. The metal pieces (blade and plate) appear to rub against each other and produce metal filings.KitchenAid refused to acknowledge the problem and suggested that I had overtightened it. I had only hand-tightened it like the directions stated, yet the problem wouldn't go away even after using it for a while. Disappointed, I returned it to the store."
1,Killed our mixer,"Short and sweet... BUYER BEWARE. Second time using this attachment a gear broke loose and chipped the Artisan tilt back housing that holds it in place. Mixer was able to run on one speed only. KA had no sympathy at all. Repairs were same cost as replacement, so we trashed it. Wife was upset - I was/am angry. Don't be like us, get a dedicated meat grinder with a reverse function. SHAME ON YOU KITCHEN AID."
2,Thank God it was free!,"This came free as a promotion with my Professional 6 model. It might be me, but I used this for the first time to grind some meat. It worked fine, I hand washed all of the parts and dried them. The next time I used it was for cheese. This time all the cheese that came out had this grayish stuff on it that looked like grease. GROSS! So I thought I must not have cleaned it properly. So again I washed it well and the same thing happened. I wrote to Kitchenaid and got no response so, it became cabinet clutter and I haven't used it since! I buy my cheese and meat shredded/ground now."
3,Needs a better knife!,"I bought this meat grinder attachment because the hopper of my old one broke. Luckily I kept all the other pieces, because the knife provided in the new kit is terrible. It is extremely dull and difficult to sharpen. The new combination wrench and food pusher is pretty flimsy compared to the old one also, which was two pieces -- a sturdy wrench and a wooden pusher. I just hope that the hopper lasts well."
1,meat grinder attachment,"The meat grinder is very poor. The cross knife is flimsy and apparently not sharp.I put a chuck roast, after getting rid of some of the fat, through the grinder, it plugged up the holes in no time flat and I had to take it apart to clear it several times. It was a nuisance. I have not used it since. I had a self standing meat grinder many years ago which worked quite well until it disappeared during one of our moves. The cross knife was heavy steel metal and never needed sharpening.It cut any type of meat, yes it was made in Germany but bought in the USA. At this time I cannot recommend it. It is not even good as a paper weight.RespectfullyRebecca Seifert"
4,Meat grinder good plunger not,"We just tried our meat grinder and following the previous reviewers suggestions cut the pork into strips and partialy froze the pork. No problem grinding with the large holes the first time, however when we passed the pork through a second time it took significantly longer. The plunger is not very effiecent, the groud pork kept coming up the sides of the plunger and we had to keep pushing it down, this was very tedious and time consuming! The plunger does not fit the hopper and we had a very hard time. Any sugestions would be appreciated."
5,Kitchen Aid Food Grinder,My wife wanted me to buy a food grinder for the Kitchen Aid Mixer I got her for Christmas. I couldn't see paying what the Kitchen Aid site wanted for it so I looked on Amazon and this one was for sale. It said it was used. It came in the Original Box with all the original packaging and even the warranty card. IF it was ever put on the machine you can not tell it. It works excellent. We used it to make Cranberry Relish to freeze and I am very thankful we got it. I use to be the motor for the hand grinder.
1,"Metal in meat, slow to grind","Thank goodness I read the reviews ahead of time and knew to look for metal shards in the meat. It happened within the first (and only) pound. One reviewer does say to put a magic marker cap over the tip, but quite frankly, I don't trust that shards are not dispersed in smaller sizes throughout. It's also slow to grind. It's tollerable, but I hunt and I have about 30 lbs of meat to grind. This would take me all afternoonOur UPS dropped it off ~ 30 minutes ago, I'll send it back on Monday. Very disappointed."
1,why KitchenAid has this product?,"I love my KitchenAid mixer and all attachments but this, it's not designed for meats, terrible design! I don't believe it's KitchenAid made!."
1,Deposits metal into your meat,"I wanted a meat grinder and enjoy the ability to use the attachments with my Kitchenaid as well. Unfortunately, this products design is poor. Like others have stated, when using the grinder, the devices deposits metal grindings into the meat as well. These are coming from the auger shaft riding on the grinder dies. The metal is far too soft and as it rotates, metal is ground off of the center of the dies and drops into the meat."
4,Grinding and Stuffing,"I have been using my grinder and sausage stuffer attachments for almost a year now and I have enjoyed it immensely. I haven't had any of the attachment problems mentioned by other users. Perhaps the size/weight of your mixer makes a difference? I have one of the ""Professional"" series mixers. I do agree with the height issue. I'm not sure what Kitchenaid can do about it, but I do have to stand on a stool to efficiently feed my grinder. It is nice to be able to enjoy tasty sausage with a lot less grease than store-bought!"
3,Grinding Size,"The only problem I had with this unit is the hole size of the plate. In making polish sausage, the grind was to fine.The texture was like a hot dog and not sausage. Otherwise, the unit performed well"
2,Too much stress on the motor,"This grinder attachment is OK if you're only making small batches (less than 15 pounds) of sausage and if you only use it once or twice a year. But if you make larger batches or if you use it more often, you should invest in a real stand-alone meat grinder.I've made my own sausage at home for about ten years now, and this poor grinder attachment just isn't up to the job. I finally ended up having to replace my wife's stand mixer and buy my own grinder.A stand-alone grinder is much easier to use and much simpler to clean.Same goes for stuffing. A hand-cranked canister stuffer is much easier to work with."
5,Love It!,"I was a little fearful after reading some bad reviews, but I have never ever had a problem with my Kitchen Aid mixer or the Meat Grinder attachment. I have had it for over a year and have been grinding all of my own meat ever since the question of Mad Cow came up. It does take a little time to grind up 2 pounds of beef, but if you do want to grind up your own meat like I do, I would highly recommend this product. Mine has never jammed or overheated the mixer or done nothing less than grind up the meat perfectly on one pass with the larger blade attachment. I think it is easy to wash up right in the sink and seems to come out clean with very little effort of using a bottle brush to clean out the inside. I use it every couple months without problems and do enjoy using it."
4,Bought it as a gift....,"I got it as a gift for a good friend of mine. She had been wanting one for a while. She seems to enjoy it. First thing she used it for was to make ground beef for chili, which was delicious. She said it worked great and had no complaints other than that it was difficult and gross to clean. But I guess I would expect this from something that grinds meat. Apparently if you use it to grind bread afterwards it gets all of the unwanted leftover flesh out of the grinder. But I guess from what she said I would consider buying one for my kitchenaid and therefore would recommend it to others."
2,KITCHENAID ACCESSORY,"NOT FILLED MY EXPECTATIONS, HARD TO WASHING, Release metal particles,compared to the quality and the excellent KitchenAid Food Grinder, this accessory should see higher quality"
1,very unsatisfied,"Im placed the order for a new Kitchen Aid attachment and received a used defective one. As a result, had to pay for shipping of a defective item. Not worth the hassle - drive to the store."
4,Works great and is exactly what I expected!,Was glad to get it quickly and be able to put it to work right away. Fits perfectly on my Kitchenaid and worked well.
5,KitchenAid Grinder attachment,This was a Christmas gift for my mother that lives in a different state. She abolutely loves it for her standup mixer.
5,EXCELENT GRINDER A REAL WORK HORSE!,"Got this grinder in AM that evening used it to grind a good size deer.Was very very impressed it did a wonderful job !!!Did better than the meat butcher! I used it yesterday to grind up some sausage to mix with the deer meat it did a awesum job,I LOVE this grinder I can't wait to use it again.Also clean up is a breeze. I will say this I am very picky about my kitchen products so when I say its Excellent it is !I love it and know you will too!!"
3,"Works, but clogs easily","After using this twice for meat, I can say it's alright - especially for that price.The two included screens are a nice touch, so you can grind at different sizes. The build quality is adequate and it interfaces with the stand mixer nearly perfectly.Each time I ground meat, I had to stop after about a pound in order to clean the screen and remove meat from the driver. Perhaps I need to do a better job of removing fat or connective tissue. It works best when the meat is cut into long, thin strips and placed in the freezer for about an hour (but not completely frozen through). I also recommend keeping the metal parts of the grinder in the freezer and using a chilled bowl.All in all, it's worth the money for the occasional grind - just be prepared to clean it out mid-grind."
3,"Works okay, but non-standard size","Grinds okay, but note that the grinder is a non-standard size and not very big. The smallest industry size is a #5 and this is even smaller. Therefore, you cannot buy many accessories for it such as sausage stuffer's and such."
4,Great Attachment,"I LOVE my KitchenAid stand mixer and have only had the Food Grinder Attachment for a short time, but so far am very happy with it. I have limited counter space but do keep the mixer out because I make bread often. The Grinder attachment is quick and easy to set up. The only problem I've found is that it's a little difficult to get it pushed all the way in when attaching it - make sure it clicks before you tighten the screw. I think that may get better as the 'newness' wears off. So far I've found it easy to clean. I use a bottle brush to get the inside clean and also read a tip somewhere about putting a slice of bread through it after grinding meat or other 'sticky stuff.' That works great. Am looking forward to trying other attachments to get the most out of my stand mixer."
3,"Good, but needs a little improvement","It really is a savings on your grocery budget if you can grind your own meats. This is a good attachment for the Kitchen Aid. The only thing I can see that could be better are the holes in the grinder blade. They could stand to be a little bigger. As they are now, the meat tends to get mushy instead of grounded."
1,Horrible! Don't Buy,"Attempting to use this product was so frustrating that I almost threw the entire mixer across kitchen. I attempted to use it 3 times with 3 different cuts of meat. I followed the instructions and partially froze the meat. The slightest amount of fat instantly wraps around cutting blade instead of getting cut. This blocks the meat from going through the grinder. Un-jamming takes about a minute and needs to be done every minute or so of use. Pork butt is impossible to grind. Lean beef and chicken did eventually grind, but it was more of a mush consistancy than ground (yes, I used the attachment with large holes).Every time I used it I did notice that parts of the meat were turning brown. I assumed that it was from the meat being pulverized to the point where it actually started cooking. Then I read the other reviews which assume that it is metal dust from the cheap blade(entirely possible).I recieved this thing as a gift, it is getting thrown away."
3,Find a Solid way to Secure this Grinder,"As a grinder it works great. A major flaw in the design is evident after securing it to the mixer. The grinder doesn't sit in the well securely and has to be supprted while using the pusher. There is no distinct indentation to easily secure the set screw. Without a proper level of security the grinder will vibrate out of position and begin to spin, and suddenly fall off. To remedy this, an indentation must be drill in, not through, the shaft in line with the set screw."
3,Works great - but there is green ooze,"Like others (see comment section) I've noticed a green ooze that comes out along with the meat. It's disgusting and I'm not entirely certain what it is. It appears to be rubbed off of the middle of the metal grinding plates. I'm convinced there are metal shavings. It has a greasy consistency, but there is no grease or lubricant in this part of the grinder. I try to remove as much of it as possible.As far as the grinding itself goes, works as advertised and no complaints. I just wish I could get my ground beef without the green ooze."
4,Sausage grinder,The cubed meat went through the machine very well. Sencond grind worked ok if you placed the first grind in the freezer. The throat of the grinding is a little small. Third ran through the nozzle for stuffing casing and found it went through ok if held in the freezer for awhile. Stuffed the casings well and was easy to take apart and clean. I only do 3 to 6 lbs at a time with this and it works just fine and like the doug hook for blending the seasoning in the first grind in the kitchen aid bowl. If you are wanting something to put out 15lbs or more of meat I'd say this is the wrong tool but for us it works great and the sons like the results as well as friends.
5,KitchenAid Grinder review,"I needed a food grinder attachment for my KictchenAid mixer to prepare a special recipe for the holidays. Found a used one on Amazon.com, the price was very reasonable, and they shipped it to me quickly. It works perfectly, I got raves about my fruit/nut log, and am completely happy with the product. Good price, prompt shipping, what more could a person ask for?Pearl Anderson"
4,Worth Getting,"I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but now after using it, I'm glad I purchased it. Round steak is normally tough, so I take and cut it in strips and add strips of bacon as I'm grinding the meat, it makes great hamburgers. The only down side that I have found is when you finish grinding, the plastic ring is sometimes hard to remove."
5,Totally Worth It,This attachment rocks! We use this thing all the time; it grinds chicken up perfectly and grates cheese with ease.
1,"junk, junk, junk!","I don't know what the other reviewers were using but it couldn't have been the one I had-the one with cheap chinese-made everything. I had one from a while back and decided to get a new 'Professional' Kitchenaid mixer along with a new grinder. I first tried to grind partially frozen pork fat with the large-hole plate. It was an utter disaster. The holes clogged in about 10 sec and the fat oozed all around the opening even though I tightened it. The I tried some meat and the same thing happened! I am sooo bummed out that an American standard is selling such crap. I used to be able to slice a round steak and feed the whole thing right through the grinder without even chopping it into cubes.The plates are thin and the cutter is useless. Save your mioney, spend a few bucks more and get a better made grinder - hopefully old so it'll be made in the USA."
3,misleading picture,"when i recieved the grinder there was no stomper in the box although one was pictured in the description. The grinder works okay on the slow setting and all things considered, sure beats a hand grinder."
1,Do not buy this,"Do not buy this attachment. We used it(following the instructions) for about 10 min. grinding about 3 lbs of lean meat and the main drive gear of the MIXER broke. We replaced the gear (no help from KitchenAid), and tried it again on some pork trim and after a few minutes and less than 1 lb. it happened again! Do not waste your time and money on this attachment- buy a meat grinder- we have since bought a waring pro M800 and I recommned it."
3,Chicken is hard to do,"Tried the grinder on chicken breasts still slightly frozen. In order to feed into the grinder, you need to have precut the meat into long slices a few inches wide. When the meat was soft enough to cut, I cut it and fed it into the grinder. Tissue from the chicken blocked the plates with holes on it, preventing chicken from coming out, and attempts to push it through with the food poker resulted in back spray of raw chicken juice on me, clothes, cabinets, counter, etc. It took a very long time to grind the two breasts; I probably could have diced them by hand in a fraction of the time. Next time I will try to cut the chicken into slices first, then freeze it, then feed it through well frozen. Wish me luck."
4,Great tool but it won't last,"I'm back here buying another food grinder attachment. After a few years of use, the plastic housing cracks severely around the area where it joins the mixer base, probably due to vibration and stress. They should make this out of all metal. I wouldn't give mine away though, and I am buying another one."
3,Durability and wear issues,"I've had my meat grinder for many years but I haven't used it more than a dozen times. The plastic cracked all around the housing where it goes onto the mixer (near the screw). I'm going to order another one because I really need it, but I'm going to save my reciepts in case this one also cracks.As far as usage is concerned I'd give this 4 stars, but durability is NOT good!BTW: don't try to grind bones in this, this grinder isn't that heavy duty. I never did, I just know someone tried."
4,OK,I didn't like the fact that the attachment is made from plastic (looks cheap compared to the kitchen aid mixer base) and also if you need something powerful this is not for you. The recommended speed is 4 which is pretty slow.
2,Well..,"We actually never used it. We sent it back right away just by the looks of it.My Dad does a lot of meat grinding and making homemade sausage. He uses everything metal. Unfortunately, it didn't look like it could handle the job it was really meant to do."
2,Not totally pleased,"I purchased this grinder to process deer meat based on the advice of friends who use it for this purpose. Unfortunately, I was not very happy with it. First off, all meat was chilled in the freezer so it would be more firm. It was okay in grinding the deer meat. However, if I ground beef chuck to add to the deer meat, it did not do well at all. I was very diligent in removing any sinew/silver skin from the chuck, but it still clogged the grinder. Additionally, the grinder regularly put out gray/silver metal findings that others have complained about. I did not find this acceptable. By the way, I have to chuckle about the directions that say to freeze the metal blade before grinding. Seriously, how long do you think you have to grind meat before the ""chilled"" blade warms up. I returned this for a refund."
2,Light Duty Only,"I have owned my KithenAid Pro (325w) KSM5 for about 16 years. It performs reasonably well - unless using the grinder or making bread dough. Initially I used the ""grinder"" attachment for extruding spaghetti as advertized. This didn't work. The motor started to labor and smoke. I tried making my dough softer, but this was vastly less than ideal. I figured it would work for meat grinding with the metal screen and knife since the machine wasn't laboring. I was wrong. The body of the grinder barrel fractured in 2 pieces under the stress of the meat and torque of the motor. I didn't hit a bone. Perhaps it was too cold, and the plastic was brittle. I suppose the attachment could be used for something, but processing chilled meat in a cool environment should not be a consideration."
4,Not Bad,"The food grinder works well in a pinch. I have a LEM meat grinder which works much better, but I was glad I had this available when the blade broke and I needed to finish a job. I found that the plunger was easier to use when rubbed down with some olive oil. The motor doesn't pull the meat through for me, so the plunger is a must. It does help to have the meat really cold too. It's cheap and an attachment, not a full blown grinder machine, so don't expect it to be a work horse, but with patience it will get the job done."
3,Meat Grinder,"For what I wanted this meat grinder for, it did not work at all. It's too small and just to weak. The meat I was grinding backed up and hopelessly overheated my kitchenaid machine.Maybe it would work well for lean soft meats."
5,I love this attachment for my Kitchenaid,"Easy to use. Pretty easy to clean up. Works great. Has several uses but I buy chuck roasts on sale then cut part for shish-kebabs and part in strips (faster and easier than chunks)to feed into the grinder (2x) for hamburgers, meatloaf etc. When I was checking reviews I read only a couple negatives from people who expected this to grind up anything/any size, like a commercial unit. Just treat it nicely and don't expect it to be what it isn't."
4,Works for meat but not tendon,"This grinder works well for grinding beef and makes great meat balls.The only complain is the tendon from the beef chunks stuck the holes and I need to remove the blades several times to complete the grinding.Also, the applicator is not the wooden one as shown in the photo anymore. It's a plastic one."
1,bad product,"This grinder and sausage maker is too poorly made to be of any use. the blade does not cut the meat and binds up constantly. the multi tool wrench, stuffer is too small so meat squarest up around it instead of being forced thru the grinder. This is the worst design i've ever experienced for this type of product. better of buying a hand crank sausage maker."
2,kitchen aid food grinder,"I have had a grinder for over 40 years when I bought my first Kitchen aid mixer. It lasted and lasted.My cutting blade finally could not cut the meat so I ordered a new one this past March 2012. When Ireceived it, I was excited to grind some meat and WOW I was SO disappointed with the cutting blade!! It is apiece of junk!!!! Barely cuts the meat to send it through as ground meat. I don't recommend it. Kitchenaidis becoming quality junk!! It used to be a solid name with dependability. Since Whirlpool took it over manyyears ago, it has gone through a metamorphosis that is downgraded."
3,food grinder,I found that you needed to remove almost all of the gristle or have it partially frozen. Mine got clogged often and needed to be cleaned. Next time I'll partially freeze the meat.
5,A must have attachment,"I'm a big fan of cookies and breads, but any self respecting omnivore has got to start thinking SAUSAGE as soon as they get their kitchenaid mixer. This is a great product at a good price. Easy to clean and plenty of grind power. I would plan on making your own pusher with a piece of large wood dowel. the plastic one that comes with, I did not like. But that is a small detail."
1,Total Crap,"Got metal shavings in ground meat. Had to stop and clean blade (which is complete junk) that got all gummed up all the time! What a mess! If you are thinking of making sausage or grinding any amount of meat, buy a REAL meat grinder!"
4,KitchenAid Food Grinder,Works great for grinding 4 or 5 lbs of meat. I would not use it for anything greater than that. I will never buy store ground hamburger again. I'd give it a 5 outof 5 star rating using it for what it was intended for.
2,The metal comes off,"Read good overall reading and thought it would be great and convenience since I already have a KitchenAid mixer. However, the black metal comes off between the cutter and blade so I returned. Return to Amazon is pretty seamless."
3,kitchen aid food grinder,This is the best price around but order two because one will break for sure in the middle of grinding something.
1,defective,"This is a cheap quality product. I grind meats in it. It gets some kind of oil on your food. Kitchen Aid will not give a refund, just a replacement. They told me it's a safe oil. What a ridiculous statement."
5,NEW AND IMPROVED,"AT FIRST WAS UNHAPPY WITH PLASTIC PUSHER/TOOL THAT REPLACED WOODEN TOOL ON OLDER MODELS. THEN REALIZED NEW PUSHER HAS BUILT IN STOP SO WILL NOT GET WARN BY FEED ASSEMBLY LIKE OLD MODEL. GOOD UNIT, VERY PLEASED."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,This grinding attachment leaves grease and metal in the meat. I am returning for refund. No excuse for trash like this to be sold in America. May be OK for third world use.
3,KitchenAid Food Grinder,This Grinder is probably adequate for the purpose it was intended for ... But nothing special or outstanding!Like all KitchenAid products ...It is Very pricey for no more than what is there.
1,Gray ooze in my Ground Beef - Do Not Buy!,"I wish I had heeded the advice of the other reviewers. I used the Grinder attachment one time to grind some sirloin and chuck for beef jerky. However, after about five minutes, all the ground beef coming out of the attachment was contaiminated with a greasy gray ooze coming from the center of the grinder plate assembly. I don't care if this is food-safe grease, it is very unattractive and has no place in anything that I want to eat.Irrespective of the grease in my food, I guess the grinder worked OK. It made a mess, and juices from the beef squirted all over the kitchen, but I could deal with that better than contaimination in my food. Overall, this is a pretty flimsy piece of equipment and is VERY hard to clean as well.Do not buy."
3,manual grinder still better,"The grinder works ok but is hard to clean as it is hard to reach the rear of the grinder body. Manual, old fashion grinder works better."
1,Not Worth It,"I had bought this and the stuffer tubes a couple of weeks ago and returned it to Amazon. I was interested in making my own sausages.The grinder emulsified a pork shoulder. Even when I trimmed the fat and silver skin off (and nearly freezing the meat), the blade kept getting clogged from whatever marbled fat that was in the meat. It made the motor bog and run very hot (Artisan model). There were also some odd deposits in the meat coming from the grinder (others complain about this too).Basically, if you are somewhat serious about making sausages or ground meat in batches larger than 2 lbs., save a little more and buy a quality meat grinder and seperate stuffer. This attachment will only frustrate you and possibly kill off your very expensive mixer."
3,KitchenAid FGA Food Grinder,"I'm not quite sure what will happen after the 6 months are finished. I purchased as a Christmas gift and hope that there are no problems using it. It didn't come with all the pieces as pictured above, the wooden plunger was not there."
4,Great Product,"A little pricey, but great quality, durable and does the job. She likes it.....that's all that matters, right!? Overall, not bad."
2,Plastic Screw Cracking,"I am disappointed that a 5 uses, 3 grinding beef and 2 stuffing sausage cases that the screw that pushes the meat out is already cracking. I will be looking for an all steel version."
1,Black grease inside,"Every time I do grinding, I found black grease inside and I am so afraid to use it now. There has to be a better design."
1,Metal shavings in food,I am also going to return this item since I have had the same problem as many other users with metal shavings getting into the meat I grind. I'm just glad I noticed it since it doesn't do it all the time. After so many complaints this thing should get recalled.
4,ENJOY HOMEMADE SAUSAGE!,"I bought this item for my son-in-law who loves to cook. He's really enjoyed making sausage for pizza, sausage for breakfast, and sausage just because. It's somewhat time consuming, but not nearly as bad as I had envisioned. If you want to know what's in your sausage, be the one to put it there.PS - If you order this be sure to get the stuffer attachment and also casings."
4,Great attachment to add to your mixer,"This attachment works great. I used it to make apple sauce and it was so easy to use. Comes apart and goes together very easy, an is dishwasher safe. I did have to rewash the fine mesh strainer by hand as the dishwasher did not get it totally clean but it was not hard to clean."
4,food grinder,The grinder works great for HOME uses. I would not consider this item for large grinding jobs like processing your own deer or livestock. I would recomend the food tray attachment since the grinder mouth area is somewhat small.
4,Great for low volume grinding,"I bought the Food Grinder attachment a few years back and use it on a semi-regular basis for meat grinding and making cranbery relish.I typically grind 5 or 6 pounds of meat for chili and the grinder does a pretty good job of it. I've found that you can't stuff the grinder full of meat or the mixer motor begins to bog down pretty badly. I have the Kitchenaid Pro-line version of the mixer, not the lower powered mixer. If you're going to be using the lower end model, make sure you don't overwork the unit.Usually, I need to cube the meat and only feed a few pieces at a time. Still, it gives a nice consistant grind and is easy to clean up when I'm done.When I make cranberry/orange relish, the grinder does a good job of keeping the juice where it belongs and not leaking all over like the old mechanical grinder I used to use."
1,DANGEROUS METAL PARTICLES,"The metal parts of this product are shoddily made of inadequate materials. Metal dust is created between the hub of the worm, the cutter and the cutting plate rubbing together. Extreme health hazard. Imagine using this for baby foods!!!! Too bad as this product would be great if it was manufactured and engineered to a better standard.Amazon have been great issuing a full refund. Since KitchenAid was sold to Whirlpool/Sears it has become just like many of Sears other brands. Junk! Too bad. Iconic American companies being sold out for quick profits. The high price of low cost!"
2,Not a good accessory for this excellent mixer,"I am on my second grinder - no more! It grinds OK, but when you're finished, there is always some meat caught between the blade and the disc. The blade doesn't seem to hold its' sharpness. But the most frustrating problem is that both the feed shaft and the housing are made of molded plastic on metal. After relatively little use, the plastic begins to crack and break away from the metal. Since this is used for grinding meat, the cracks make it extreamly hard to clean. I recommend against this accessory and suggest finding a seperate all metal meat grinder (which I am in the process of doing)."
4,A great start for the world of sausage grinding,"If you're a home cook or a professional tinkering on your day off, this handy device is just what you'll need to get started making your own sausages. I have been extremely pleased with the results of nearly 50 batches of sausage, from 1 lb. to 25!I will caution beginners on a few things: Work cold- I store the moving parts (after I clean and wash them) in the freezer. The food tray is not very large so work close and clean- the longer the machine churns, the warmer it gets and the more gummy your meat will get. Work in small batches if you are going for a large finished product. The Rammer- the handle that you use to push the meat into the screw/grinder, is kind of a pain in the behind- it is smaller than the hole so meat frequently climbs up the sides, and makes stuffing ground meat back down the hole for stuffing outrageously difficult. I've replaced mine with a measured dowel. The slower your grind, the coarser your texture.Experiment and have fun!"
2,Not what it used to be,"We replaced our food grinder after 15 years of hard use. The new cutting blade is junk, the body of the unit falls to one side, the coarse die is much bigger than the original and it doesn't do the job nearly as well as the one we have had for 15 years."
4,A must-have for KitchenAid mixer owners,"This attachment is a great place to begin if you want to expand the uses for your KitchenAid mixer. Although it grinds meat (great for making chicken or turkey sausage if you can't stand the idea of feeding venison through it!), for me it's primary use is the driving of other attachments. You need the grinder if you want to use the fruit/vegetable strainer or the pasta attachment.I took away one star only because the feeding ""worm"" can be difficult to clean. Otherwise, this is a high-quality product, a must-have for people who want to utilize the strength of their machines. If you know someone who has a mixer, this would make an excellent gift."
1,Not what I imagined,It seeps a black yuck on my meat after just a few minutes of grinding. I don't know where this stuff is coming from. It takes me that much time picking through the meat getting all the black parts out.
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to grinding my own meat and was thrilled that this relatively inexpensive item, highly recommended by Cooks Illustrated, was available to attach to my existing appliance. Unfortunately, I experienced the well-documented problem of dark grey meat extruding from the center hole of the grinder- very, very unappetizing. Did try a lower speed, tightened the ring very loosely, and cleaned the grinder thoroughly; none of these strategies prevented the greyness. So, I will reluctantly return the item. Other than the greyness, it was effective at grinding meat. Since I don't grind large quantities of meat at a time, I'll use a food processor for future meat grinding, which works pretty well based on my limited experience."
4,incomplete order,"order was incomplete. wooden plunger shown in description was not enclosed with order. not worth it to me to pay for return shipping, but highly disapointing. would like to know how i can get this item without returning the whole order, but can't find page on amazon to do so. first order from amazon - not encouraging."
1,KitchenAid FGA Food Grinder Attachment for Stand Mixers,The other reviews about this product causing metal filings to be found in the ground food are correct.I will be contacting KitchenAid to voice my concerns.Not the fault of Amazon.Amazon....consider not selling this item untilproblems with product design are resolved.KitchenAid FGA Food Grinder Attachment for Stand Mixers
1,DO NOT BUY - METAL SHAVINGS,"Well, we purchased this item after reading reviews regarding metal shavings figuring it couldn't be that bad and hate to say the result was terrible. The item is inexpensivem compact and great for small jobs but the metal shavings in the food is a deal breaker. Should have just paid the extra $50 for a full size grinder rather than waste $35 in chicken breast........DO NOT BUY, metal shaving coming into the food for real."
2,"KitchenAid FGA Food Grinder-Low impact, High maintenance","It has too many parts to clean, and they are very difficult to reach. The grinder is very slow and keep on jamming. It took me 30 minutes to grind a small sweet potato. I already cut the sweet potato into small pieces before I put them into the grinder, but it was still jammed inside of the grinder body.KitchenAid FGA Food Grinder Attachment for Stand MixersIt is not worth $43 dollars for such a low impact but high maintenance equipment in my kitchen."
2,"Metal in the food, needs cleaning often","After reading all the negative reviews, I still gave this a try. It does leave metal in the food! I did have to keep cleaning it out. I've never tried a hand mincer, so might give that a go."
3,So-so,"I purchased the grinder attachment for my Kitchen Aid stand mixer so that I could grind game meats to make sausage and so forth. Of course I had reserved typically tougher cuts of meat for this purpose, not steak or chops. Any tough sinewy material clogged even the largest holes on the grinder. I had to keep stopping the mixer and cleaning the attachment out during the process. I initially only ground about 3 lbs. of meat, but after 1/2 an hour of trying to grind with the attachment at a snail's pace, I resorted to getting out an old hand grinder to see if it worked any better. I had the remaining 2+ lbs of meat ground in about 10 minutes or less. I would not recommend using this attachment for the purpose I've noted. I may use it for grinding dried fruit/nuts to make energy bars or something without grizzle or sinewy material."
3,Not as sturdy as stand alone grinder,"Before I got this attachment, I had the stand alone KitchenAid meat grinder. I used it constantly, it was a workhorse. But then we moved to a tiny house that's forced us to downsize, so I decided to give away many of my kitchen gadgets and get whatever attachments I could in their place for my KitchenAid mixer to try to free up space. This attachment is a huge disappointment, the blade and the grinder parts are very thin and flimsy compared to my old kitchenaid grinder. I'm very sorry that I gave it away, as I'm not sure how long this one will work before the blade dulls, or breaks. I suppose if I hadn't owned the previous stand alone grinder from kitchenaid I wouldn't realize the big difference between the two, but I do know and yes, I'm very disappointed."
5,DAILY GRIND,I loved the grinder. I ground several lbs of semi-frozen deer meat. I have a 600 professional mixer and it never hesitated to make the grind. I am so pleased with my purchase--it did exactly what I wanted it to.
4,Food Grinder Attachment,"I have owned a Kitchenaid mixer and the grinder attachment for about 12 years. The body of the original grinder cracked, which was the reason I bought a new one. Overall the design on the parts have changed some, but the fit and finish of the parts still looks the same. The plastic wrench for loosening the nut is now combined with the pusher. My original grinder had a wooden pusher. I think the plastic combination pusher will be more sanitary so that is a good change. The cutter blade in the new unit is thinner and appears to be a stamped piece instead of the heavier machined investment casting of the old one. I hope it holds up as long."
5,For Cheese Grating,I use it to grate many pounds of cheese and it works well. A little slower than a commercial grater but can't beat it for the price.
4,kitchenaid grinder attachment,I bought this to replace one my wife threw away on me. It's a handy item to have. Especially when hunting season rolls around!
5,Sounds like the depths of human suffering,This is some of the most sincerely tortured and emotional music I have ever heard. It is not quite like anything else out there. Nothing else quite gets to such a level of sounding so disgusting and so beautiful at the same time. Highly reccomended.
4,Boo Radleys get mellow and spacey,"This album takes a few listens to get into. Actually, it takes a few _playings_ to get into, since it's not the kind of music one usually chooses to sit down and listen to. Consisting mostly of long stretches of walls of guitar sound, it paints more of a sonic picture ala Radiohead or Beta Band. Weaved into this wall, however, is a surpriding and delightful amount of texture and variety, and some genuinely catchy tunes.The vocals are mixed (appropriately) very low, which at first irritated me. Later I understood the band's intent better, and now that doesn't bother me at all. For those already familiar with the band, this CD is their least bouncy-pop sounding, and easily the mellowest. It's also my favorite of theirs."
3,The Boo Radley's all over,"This CD is good and has the definate Boo Radley's sound. Lazy Day is areally good song on this CD and Paradise is litterally amazing. The whole CD is paradise. Memory Babe is without a doubt the highlight of the CD with pumping chords and a really good, ""sing a long"" sound. I have given this CD a low rateing because i feel that the Boo Radley's could do better and have done better but compared to other bands it is 5 stars!"
3,Dated,"This book is a good introductory to nootropics (smart drugs), however, I found it a bit dated (maybe there's an updated release??). Also, I've found just a much information freely on-line via nootropic forums."
2,Slow to ship!,I ordered the accessory and paid for one day shipping because I wanted it now! Only to be told it will ship in 20 days.Defeats the purpose of one day shipping.
5,Will The Real David Johansen Please Stand Up?,"I still pray that some day, David Johansen will drop all of this Buster Poindexter nonsense and embrace his immediate post-Dolls solo career, particular the albums ""David Johansen"" and ""In Style,"" and give us all something new to hold onto. Since that seems highly unlikely, this blistering live set from the late 1970's will have to suffice. I can't help but feel we're all lesser people for it, however, that we're somehow being robbed of something important, vital, and worthwhile. I guess Johnny Thunders was right, you can't put your arms around a memory..."
3,Good if you like this type of music...,"If you enjoy the ska-punk tone of your music then this might be an album that you can dig. While most of the songs sound alike and the vocals border on harsh tonality, I found the groove and beat of most of the songs to be catchy. It takes a welcoming ear so beware. If this is not your genre or type of music, then look elsewhere."
4,sony phone,I have no complaints about this phone. It does what it is supposed to. It works well and is fun to use. I am switching from a Motorola phone that was nothing but frustrating. I used to love motorolas but they have really not kept up with the new operating systems that are out. It was a joy to use the Sony OS and have things work like they should. I could have gotten the Razor for free but paid $100 for the sony instead and i am glad i did. I have owned a lot of cell phones in my life and have no problem recomending this one.
2,Nothing works on this phone,The camera is pretty good but the mp3 player only fits about 9 songs on it. The reason I shelled so much out for this phone was to have the phone and mp3 player in one. This phone also drops a lot of calls and I have had problems with sending files via email and actually getting a ring when someone calls.
3,impressive but frustrating,"keyboard is not illuminated; has a reflective surface that makes it hard to seesynchronization with macs is sketchy; strips company names out of address bookand replaces them with periods; only syncs up personal namesgreat screen, media features, impressive camera functionsomewhat chunky, seems robust thoughI wish I could pay $250 and get it without camera, mainly care about bluetooth and data features, but Cingular has you over a barrel since it is the only one that does that.... at least for macs"
3,make sure you consider the K750 or W800,the Sony Ericsson K750/W800 is the best phone on the marketmake sure you weigh your options before buying this
2,Disapiontment,I bought this phone because it had 1.3 mega Pix camara. Other than that feature the phone has a lot of flaws. First you have to fight with it to remove the charger or ear peace. You do not have the option to turn up the spearker. The only way I can hear is to use the ear piece. Very disappionting
2,S710a Returned,"I've been waiting a while for this phone and just got it yesterday. Most everything is the same (except for the design)as the 610. The menu is almost identical. With the exception of an MP3 player and better camera that's really it.The reason I am returning mine is because I planned on using the phone as an MP3 player. Unfortunately, the phone can ONLY use memory stick Duo (not PRO) which has a max of 128 megs. What the? Do a search for yourself and see that even Lexar and Sandisk only go to 128 for the plain memory DUO stick. What a bummer! Including a few photos brought over from my PC and 5-6 songs I filled the 32 meg card that was included. Oh well. Hope this helps.Sony Ericsson consumer support had no idea why the phone doesn't use the newer version of the memory stick DUO. Even the new PSP from Sony will use the memory stick duo pro which opens up a whole other can or worms!"
2,Great features with a bunch of bugs.,"This phone is great to impress your friends with. It's feature packed but has a bunch of issues:Poor battery life - I am constantly recharging.Poor Bluetooth connectionClock loses track of the time - my call log is all jumbled up...Poor reception - My friend has full reception on his cingular phone where mine shows ""one bar""I got a great deal from cingular on this phone to switch from Sprint. I regret the switch."
5,One of B&S' better albums,"This is the 4th B&S album I bought, and it was a fantastic purchase. After snatching up their newer albums (The Life Pursuit and Dear Catastrophe Waitress) I listened to their older stuff and this one really hits the mark. There are a couple of super-strong songs on this one, such as ""My Wandering Days Are Over"" and ""I Don't Love Anyone"". I don't think there's a dud on here, although ""Electronic Renaissance"" starts off with a somewhat-psychedelic intro that doesn't seem to match the bands other efforts."
3,Study foundation,"Oft-cited debut can't live up to classic status (lacking more intricate songwriting that was to come) but can be seen as the head-turning, prog-folk, arrangement-heavy group's official entering statement- one whose retro strumming would not be lost upon hipsters worldwide."
5,beautiful is not equal to technical proficiency,"Several people have expressed the view that this album deserves a low rating because the band ""didn't know how to play their instruments"". But even though technical proficiency and musical merit are often related, they are NOT identical. Even Miles Davis and John Coltrane were criticized in their time for apparent ""flaws"" in their playing techniques. And Joseph Cornell, a great artist, never went to art school and probably could not draw an anatomically correct human figure to save his life. If technical proficiency was a direct reflection of quality music, we should all be listening to Dave Matthews Band right now. Or Van Halen."
2,No way could I get into this CD,"I bought Tigermilk soley on the recommendations of all the other customers. It was rated as one of the hottest sellers the day I logged on. Much to my disappointment some 5 days later, I was giving the CD to my daughter. Sorry, but I just didn't ""hear"" what all the hype was about. I thought I was pretty open-minded, and I honestly tried, but this turned out to be nothing more than a miniature frisbee for me."
2,I dunno...,"I really, really don't understand why people idolize these first two B&S albums. I like The Boy with the Arab Strap. It has poignant songs that are worth listening to. But on its predecessors, B&S sound like a band trying very, very hard to be clever and for the most part failing. I do think Tigermilk is the better of the two, marginally. Expectations and She's Losing It are very good (""Who needs boys when there's Lisa around""--ow! sexy!), but the rest of it, I feel, is average at best, and Electric Renaissance is virtually unlistenable. I dunno...TBwtAS leaves me spellbound, but for the most part this just leaves me cold--there must be something good about it if so many seemingly intelligent people are singing its praises, but for the life of me I can't tell what."
1,Wax in Ears?,"I *simply* do not get all the adolation everyone seems to be giving this artist. I bought the CD after hearing they were ""the best sounds since The Beatles."" HARDLY! At best, Belle and Sebastian sounds like the opening group for a coffee house gig in NO TALENT, USA."
5,Great That its Finally bying Re-Released on CD!,"I'm glad to see that Tigermilk will finally be avabile for everyone now! Although I think their 2 other albums (If You're Feeling Sinister and The Boy With The Arab Strap) are better this is worth getting. Anything by B&S is worth getting including the E.P.'s. For thoese who dont know about Tigermilk's Hisrtory I Shall tell. Tigermilk was B&S first album and it was Released by a College Program that releases an album every year and They picked B&S that year and only 1000 Vinyl copies were pressed. So This is better then paying $150 for a vinyl copy or getting it on a tape. My Fav. tracks are Expectations, Electronic Ewnaissance and We Rule The school. GET THIS and All Belle & Sebastian's other stuff!"
4,Tiger-striped with some gems.,"Although I believe this to be the weakest of the three releases, that by no means is negative. It really has the feel of a college project, but it contains some of their finest work to date. ""The State I Am In"" is B&S personified. Humble and pretty, soft and cutting, the song visits every weapon in the Stuart Murdoch arsenal. Tigermilk also yeilds personal and fan favorites, ""We Rule the School"", and ""She Losing it"". Both are fine examples of where the band were headed. The fact that this was one of the most limited and most sought after LP's a few years ago, prompted the re-issue of this recording, now for everyone to enjoy on CD."
3,HHS,"This story is about a young boy name Tom Sawyer. As the book title suggest this book is about Adventure. This story took place around 19th century near by Mississippi river. One of his good friend name is Huck Finn. He decide to run away to a Island to be rich and find trasure. He used to like this girl called Becky Thacker. He always try to run away from his problems. Tom and his friend were the witness of Injue Joe killer with trasure. When Tom went to a picnic with McDougal's Cave with Becky, they got lost in the cave. After searching with difficulties Tom found the way out of the cave. With this kind of adventure Tom became a responsibile person as an adult man. The story ends in the last scene with a dark rendition of finalty in the cave with wild Injun Joe. During the whole book Tom tries to do the right things and overcomes his hard childhood. I really enjoy this book."
4,Bob's thoughts on Tom Sawyer,"Tom Sawyer demonstrates Mark Twain's unique style as an author. Despite the fact the language used in the novel may be hard to follow, I think the novel did a excellent job of explaining each of the character's feelings and difficulties by putting you in the person's shoes. I didn't think I would enjoy the novel after reading the first two chapters, bu then when the suspence of the storyline started to pick up, it was hard to put down. This book would be perfect for any teen or young adult due to the humor and action of the story."
4,honest fun,"Pure fun, agony and innocence of childhood in the classic way where imaginations and nature are the main entertainment. Lovely!"
4,Not a big deal - try a preview before you buy,"Ok, we read these alarming reviews. But just to check - we downloaded the preview and it really wasn't so bad. So we bought the book and my son (12) is reading away. So I would rather he get the dictionary aid kindle provides to go along with his reading vs. getting the hardcopy and a dictionary out.This is his first time to read on the kindle so he is pretty psyched (I am about to purchase one for him for his birthday).At any rate - easy does it - it isn't formatted as crisp as a ""normal"" Kindle book, hence the one ding on the star.Hey Amazon - So when do we get our own converter software to make kindle acceptable format books?"
4,4 stars it was a mighty gay adventure book,really interesting and fun i stayed up all night reading bout 50 pages cuz i couldnt stop wow wish i had the other part bout the robbers it woulda been “mighty gay“
5,Michevous Tom Saywer,"You can't believe how Tom Saywer can get into trouble.This adventuress book was written by Mark Twain.In this book he is not very rich, but not very poor either.Tom and Huck, which is Tom's friend, go on a lot of adventures together, and get into a lot of trouble.Injun Joe is an Native American, and is not best frinds with Tom and Huck.In fact he's not friends with Tom and Huck at all!Tom grew up in Hannibal, Mo.He often went swimming in the Mississippi River.Tom and Huck also see a murder in the graveyard.will an innocent person take the blame, or will the right persn be caught?Read the book of ""The Adventures of Tom Saywer,"" and find out.I rally enjoyed this book.Mostly because of the adventure and the action that took place in Hannibal, Mo.If you only read the first 20 pages you would get hooked on it, and never put it down until you finush it!I rated this book a five star book.Read this book to find out more adventures tales."
1,Don't tamper with an original classic,"The original is a classic, complete with the use of the language of the time it was written. To ""edit"" it for political correctness is unforgivable."
3,Not For Me,"Just because it’s free doesn’t mean it’s worth downloading. I got a new Kindle and quickly started downloading a bunch of apps, books, music, etc. This one is not for me…but maybe you’ll like it."
4,Well written and a little slow moving,I'm only 11 and I live in 2013 so I didn't understand most of the language. It was a very hard book which is what I wanted. Most books at this level are slow moving but with all the adventures sometimes I had trouble putting it down.
4,Very good,"This was the first book i tried out when deciding to get a kindle. I found it good, and it inspired me to read further and but the kindle. I'm not sure if i would read more Mark Twain however."
2,Do not like the speaker...,The speaker is not good with voices the children sound old. He is not a good story teller...or reader. Try someone else.
5,Classic easy reading,Its nice to take a trip back to an easier time when nothing was wired into a social network and to make friends and have adventures kids needed to leave their house and DO something. Twain is the best storyteller.
4,Thomas Sawyer,"I think that this is the best book that I have ever read. I reccomend this bood to people who like alot of adventure. It was very exciting. Tom and Huck were always getting into trouble.I liked when tom got to see his own funeral, it is funny and sad at the same time because his aunt was worried sick about him. I also like when his aunt made him paint the fence but he didn't want to so all his friends would come by and he would kind of conn them into painting the fence. He would say like ""If this was work would I be doing it"" and they would reply ""I guess your right"" That was funny."
3,Cool for Kids!,"THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER would receive four stars instead of three--IF Mark Twain didn't put romance in it. Tom skips school and has some incredible times with his friends Huck Finn and Joe Harper.Some of these adventures are re-enacted fantasy (such as playing pirates) and some are real (such as witnessing a murder). Kids of all ages will therefore like how they head to an island for their piracy. Of course they have so long a fun-time there that they are presumed dead--only to return in time for their own funeral!The murder is bad news but discovering treasure is good news--beyond their wildest dreams. Twain was quite the dreamer himself so I recommend this book for ages 8 & up. Younger kids can ""fast-forward"" past Tom's engagement at age 13!"
2,Almost Good Book,"The Book Is THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER by Mark Twain. It is about a boy named Tom Sawyer who grew up in Hannibal, Mo on the banks of the mighty Mississip, in the in the late 1800's. There are many adventures in this book and it is full of comedy. Overall I would give this book 2 of 5 stars because it is a great book but not the best I've read, and I did not like the vernacular style."
2,Bad Quality,"One of the books arrived in bad conditions, it seemed they had spilled some kind of liquid on the book and some leaves got crinkled. The other thing was the cd that came with the book; i was expected that were about the book, but the cd was about other book. Bad thing."
2,Not enough for me...,"The most striking moments dealt with showing the foolish superstitions kids have (witches, haunted houses, etc.), and juxtaposing them with the foolish superstitions of the adults (i.e. Christianity). However, there was not enough excitement or adventure for me in this volume to want to continue on with Huckleberry Finn."
4,What a Book!!!!!!,"Tom Sawyer? It's a Mona Lisa in the world of literature. This book is definitely on my top ten list. I would recomend this book for ages 9-13. Its plot is not very complex, and it is easy to read. I recommend The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.During The book, Tom learns that Injun Joe framed Muff Potter for a murder. When Muff Potter is in trial, Tom went to the stand and told on Injun Joe.When his name was said, Injun Joe ran out the window. After that, Tom and two friends, Huck and Joe, went to a deserted island. Also, he and Becky got lost in a cave.I learned this from the book. Be a kid while you are young! I don't know, but a 35 year-old ""hooking"" something would look weird. This is what I learned."
2,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"In this novel, The Adventures of Tom sawyer, Mark Twain attempts to capture his childhood on the Mississippi River. Tom Sawyer 13 is a bad kid. He steals jam, misbehaves, and plays pranks. It's summer in the 1800's on the Mississippi where Tom and his friends sneak around. Well Tom watches an Indian, Injuin Joe, kill Dr.Rodterson. He's terrified of him and has nightmares as a result. The drunk of the town, Muff Potter, gets blamed and put in jail. Finally Tom and his girl, Becky, get lost in a cave and find Injuin Joe. Injuin Joe gets locked in a cave and dies. Then Tom finds the money. This book has adventure, love, comedy, and some mystery."
5,"review of "" The Adventures of Tom Sawyer""",The book was for my son's assignment at school. The item arrived earlier than expected and was in great shape. Packaging was sufficient to ensure no damages to the item. Would purchase from this seller again.
4,The Andventures of Tom Sawyer,"The Andeventures of Tom Sawyer is a book about a young boy named Thomas Sawyer and his best friend Huckle Berry Finn and all thier adventures. One of thier adventures takes place in a cemetary were Tom and Huck are trying to get rid of thier warts, but they get a little more then what they exspected. Tom and Huck had to swear to keep mum about what they saw but what will happen if they do? You will just have to find out for your self by readin this bookI really like this book that was written by Mark Twain because it was very suspencful and you really can't tell what was going to happen next. I would highly reccommend this book to anyone who loves adventures and a two people fighting for what they believe in. I can only tell you what I think but if you really want to know how great it really is you will have to read it for yourself"
5,juicy material this is not,"This book is not interesting book from the beginning from the end. This takes place in Hannibal, MO, on the banks of the mighty Mississippi River. It is the late 1800s. Written by Mark Twain this book will not keep you on the edge of your seat for a long time. Tom has to keep a secret from everyone so he doesn't get killed. I give this book 1 star because I didn't really like the vernacular. Vernacular is hard to read for me. This book also has a lack of durogotory people. This is un-juicy."
4,Tom Sawyer Review,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a good book. In the story Tom and Huck witness a murder Should they tell? Tom and Huck also want to find a treasure, but will they ever find one?Tom lives with his Aunt polly and his little brother Sid because their parents died.Tom meets Huckleberry Fin who lives in the woods. Tom also falls in love with Becky Thatcher. Tom has many more adventures,but to find out more of them read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."
5,Great,"Haven't read this since I was a kid, still a great read, recommended for younger readers as an introduction to Twain."
5,Great book,It is nice !! I just love this book . My favourite edition of this fabulous fantastic superb lovely book .
5,Tom sawyer,I love mark twain and love being able to read this classic. it was for me this time not the girls.
1,Horrible Wording,"When I first got it I was excited to read it ,but as soon as I started reading it,the wording didn't make sense to me."
4,An Absolute Read for Fifth-Graders,"Within a week I finished (and sincerely enjoyed) Tom Sawyerand it was a very interesting read.The story took place in the early 1800s when kids could hitch-hike and treasureswere possible and likely to find. There is a bit of blood,a bit of revenge, a bit of romance, and lots of adventure- so if you likea mix of all that, Tom Sawyer would be my first book suggestion.It's a very fun and interesting read, and if your looking for that sort of book,read on!"
2,Won't let me read,It won't let me read the book so I have nothing to put as a review for this hopefully after this I can read it
3,Tom Sawyer,This book was okay and kind of hard to understand. I enjoyed it through.maybe should make. A younger version? It would be helpful
3,annoying,the table of contentes is a total mess its a good book but the kindle version could have been done better
3,My side of the story of Tom Sawyer,"Tom sawyer was a ok book. It didn't explain things to well in the begging. It should of elaborated more!! I know that the story could have been even better!! It should have also explained the characters a little better. Sid and Aunt Polly werent exlained that well!!Luv,~me~"
3,click here for the truth,I did not think that Tom Saywer was a exceptionally good book. Some parts of the book was good though. The villain is a good one. I thought that the Muff Potter trail was a obvious part whit a obvious ending. which was sad because that was sopose to be a go part. all in all it could have been a better book. So I GIVE IT THREE STARS.Perfectly neutral eh???
4,TOm Sawyer Review,"I thought that the book Tom Sawyer was relly good. When you read it's like you are there in the book and you are one of the charicters. There is some parts in the book that are boring but it dose not last for more then one chapter, but other then that the book is really cool. You should read this bvook I know that you would realy enjoy it. I know i Enjoyed this book."
5,Tom Sawyer is cool,I recomend this book for kids Becuse its a good book for kids to read. In this book Tom has some wiled avenjers from wight washing his fence to witnasing a murrder. He gives his cat some pain killer and goes to a murrder tryol. He fakes his owne deth and finds some turresher. Tom and his frends chases a murrderer and gets trapd in a cave. In this book Tom sees a murrder. He and his frnds find turresher and find the person who did the murrder dead in a cave.
5,Tom Saywer,"Tom Saywer is a good book. Mark Twain is a good writer. I recomend it for anyone who knows how to read. The white washing part is neat. The graveyard part is neat too. Mark Twain is a great writer. I like this book, and a lot of other people like it too. This book is a really really really really really really really really really really really good book. Every one should read this."
3,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"The book of Tom Sawyer is very interesting and full of action. Tom gets in trouble the whole story and even watches his own funeral. The quiet town of Hannibal, Missouri is quiet exept for the drunks, killers, and Tom."
5,"""Great Read""","Tom stands for the freedom that the American frontier offered to everyone. His aunt Polly represents the civilizing influence of adults and towns. Like many young people, Tom would rather be having fun than going to school and church. This is always getting him into trouble, from which he finds unusual solutions.The reader is also swept away by the many adventures of Tom and his friends. Many of their adventures are a part of imagination, pretending to be pirates or Robin Hood.The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a fascinating, and adventurous book, I recommend this book for people who like reading about adventures.Tom Sawyer is an exciting book that takes place in the 1830's. This classic, written by Mark Twain, portrays a boy who could talk people into doing just about anything.An Antarctic MysteryAround The World in Eighty DaysDick Sands the Boy CaptainEight Hundred Leagues on the AmazonThe Adventures of a Special CorrespondentThe Blockade Runners"
4,Good story,Engages reader. Compelling and very interesting story with a good plot! I'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good book. Read this book!
4,Take it for what it is,"This is not a book for adults, so do not go into it with adult expectations. The plot is not very complex, nor are the characters that rich. But for what it is, mainly a children's book that has a tendancy to make adults whistful about their own youth, it works fairly well. Clearly not Twain's best (I am partial to _Connecticut Yankee_ as well as, of course, _Huck Finn_) but all in all a decent book, and one that should not be overlooked. The main reason for the missing star in my review is the introduction. I was hoping for something a bit more substantial. In actuality, it is short and not very informative. The glossing is all in the back of the book and none of the glossed words are marked in any way, which makes the reader guess which words might have extra meaning, or have changed in some way over time. I imagine there are better versions of the book available, and I would suggest someone looking to buy it find them."
3,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"I think that the Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a decent book, but I've read better. The superstitions are hilarious, but I can say that they didn't really help the book much. The story was a bit confusing and boring, because the book sometimes talked about a day, then a next day, before skipping to the following week. I didn't really like Tom Sawyer because he enjoyed doing pranks and some of them cause more pain than joy to the people around him. I think that I might have enjoyed this book at a younger age, but for now my rating is as it is."
4,Overflowing with liveliness and fun!,"This book was amazing! I never knew America had such a talented writer. I always thought that all the great writers came from England. But when I found out that Mark Twain was from America, that stereotype was immediately blasted out of my mind. The tangles and scrapes that Tom and Huck found themselves in was described so well by Mark Twain that I felt I was right alongside them when they discovered a treasure, or when they went on a quest to be pirates. The only reason that I did not give this book five stars was because the olden-day setting was hard to relate to, so some of the vocabulary, terms, and accents were hard to understand. But I caught on. This a must-read for anybody of any age, if your'e 11, like me, or 90, or anywhere in-between, I guarantee you will enjoy this book. A true classic!"
3,Suggestions,"The book was interesting but next time make the next page other percent,pretty please?Over everything I said before I liked the Book alot"
3,GOOD Book,I rated this three stars because since it is a classic and a good book it didn't really catch my attention that much
3,"No illustrations, classic story","Classic Mark Twain, but illustrations missing. My first Kindle book and I chose it to experiment with the device as I had read the book before"
3,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,It was a good book. Everyone should read it. It's history. Real easy read. Lots of adventure.I will make my kids read this.
5,It's Tom Sawyer - need I say more?,"What a great story , one that can be enjoyed time and time again. Samuel Clemens is an American treasure."
5,The adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark twain,A great book for 10year-old children and up it is the best book I have ever readYay a great book skydoesminecraft skydoesminecraft skydoesminecraft skydoesminecraft slamacow
2,Not quality binding,"Really poorly bound, or maybe the pages just aren't cut properly. In any case when the book is closed, on the long edge the pages are not flush and even. I don't think the book will fall apart, but it just seems sloppy. Also there are distracting 'notes' throughout the book. These explain some of the 'old fashioned' terms used, but I think are unnecessary and certainly not part of the original work."
4,How the Tom Sawyer Book was to me,"Tom Sawyer is a very adventurous boy. He liked to explore with his friends. His Aunt Polly which he lives with is alway getting worried about Tom because he always runs away.Tom is always in trouble. It is like trouble follows him. Tom likes this girl named Becky and he keeps breaking his heart.Tom lives in Hannible, Miss.The chariters are Becky,Aunt Polly,Tom,Sid,Mary,Doc. Robinson,Muff,and Injun Jo. The plot is about a boy who comes apond a secret .Tom Sawyer is a good book you should read it."
4,"Tom Saywer, the best book ever and a must read!!","The book Tom Saywer is a book about a boy who hates to read, hates school, and hates all work but, is a very ittelligent boy. He has a aunt Polly that he lives with a drives her nuts. Tom has friends that he tricks into doing his work all the time.Huckleberry Finn or Huck as Tom calls him. Huck is a poor boy that lives in a barrel. Huck is thief that goes where he wants whenever he wants but, towards the end you'll see how much they all change in the end because of just one person Injun Joe.The book The Adventures of Tom Saywer is a book written by Samuel Clemens A.K.A. Mark Twain."
5,It was an excellent story,"I thought The Adventures of Tom Sawyer was a great story. I like it because it was an adventure story,and I like adventure stories. I would recommend this book to teenagers, and teenage boys especailly.The story was about a young boy who always tricked people into do his work for him .My favorite part in the story was when Tom tricked a young boy into white wash afence for him. And finally enclosing,I would to say that Tom Sawyer was a great book and I had alot of fun reading it."
3,I wanted so much to love this book,"I wanted so much to love this book, but I just never was fully drawn into it. While I loved Tom's spirit (especially his superstitious nature and all the details about his folk beliefs), the organization of the book was just too episodic for me. I found myself thinking wistfully ofThe Mysterious Stranger, which I read just a couple of months ago. It didn't help that most of the plot was already very familiar to me just from exposure to pop culture over the years.I'm not giving up on reading more Twain -- I just think this particular book wasn't a good fit for me."
2,adventures,"I thought this book was very boring. It was advetures, but not the type of adventure kids are looking for these days. I think that if it was still the 40's or 50's I might like this book."
1,Glad I avoided this book in high school,I am trying to read the classics with my new kindle. I decided to start with Tom Sawyer...mistake. I am 20% done and I am DONE!
2,up to pages 64,"I gave the book two stars, because the writing is good. But the story is confusing to me.I still don't know what is going on after finished reading the book at page 64. I stop and begin to reading other book (David Copperfield, just finished chapter 1, which is a much better book than Tom Sawyer. Much much better, it grabbed my attention right away). I am not sure I will return to finish the Tom Sawyer book. I read some of Mark Twain's short story, they are good, but Tom Sawyer lost me."
3,Its Alright,"I read this book Tom Sawyer. I thought it was an ok book. If I had to choose between the book or the movie I would choose the movie. Just because it is much more interesting. A reason why I didn't really like this book is because it was kinda boring and all that happened was that he had adventures. It should have more like he gets in trouble, he goes on an adventure, he has to solve a mystery amd stuff like that. Well I guess that this book was ok."
2,don't understand,I though the book was going to be more adventorus but the language is very hard to understand
2,What? What? What?,"I must admit - I am totally unimpressed by this supposed ""classic"". If you have to read a book about mindless adventures, scheming, and with a boneless plot and a style that rambles on and on and gives away about a million plot details prematurely to boot, I suggest you search for something else. It isn't even funny. Not a bit.What is it about this book that attracts people so much and makes it a regular staple of school reading lists? The language? The characters? The story (not that there is any)? Maybe people enjoyed this kind of thing when it was first published, say, one and a half centuries ago, but not anymore.In short: no thanks."
3,A Review Of The Adventures Of Tom Sawyers Adventures,"The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer is an okay book.It is a great book for reports. Mark Twain takes you into the exciting life of Tom Sawyer.Tom is always getting into trouble for playing tricks on his Aunt Polly. Tom is an ordinary boy who goes on adventures that you could never forget.The only bad thing about this book is that it goes all over his life and so you can never get a grasp of who he is. Basically, this is a good book for younger children.Tom even tricks his own friend into white washing his aunt's fence. I have to admit that Tom is a smart boy (especially in tricking people to trade great stuff for junk like fishing line), but Mark Twain could have done better."
3,"Murder in Hannibal, Mississippi","The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a wonderful book for young people. What happends in the book is Tom and Huck go into the graveyard at nightto cure warts. When they get to grave and hear some voices, they begin to get scared. So they kind of hide behind the grave. The people came walking up. It was Injun Joe, Muff Potter, And Dr. Robinson. The Doc and Injun Joe got into a little fight, and Injun Joe stabed the Doc. Huck and Tom saw the whole thing, and are sworn to secracy. That is until someone finds out that Tom and Huck saw the murder.Huck and Tom are from a small town called Hannibal, Missouri. Like I said earlear, this book is wonderful for young people, because your little kids are just like Tom and Huck. But I strongly recommend that you are an advanced reader before you read this book. This is a very detailed book. Everything in that book is based on what Tom and Huck saw that special ight at the graveyard."
1,Poor quality,"Not as described. Not the book I ordered. I ordered one in good condition with a dust cover. The book I received is in poor condition and no dust cover as advertised. Pages falling out and binding on book is ripped and ready to fall off. Also has such an odor that one cannot even hold it near them. Item was listed as ""good"" condition. . I would have gladly paid more for a quality item and wished it was described accurately. Yes, I realize the age of the book, but ""good"" condition to me does mean falling apart."
3,Better than I thought,"This book was a little more episodic than I like, but it was better than I expected. It would have gotten more stars but it is just hard to like a book where I don't really care for the main character at all, also I hate books written in dialect."
5,A True Classic,Tom Sawyer is a true book icon this book follows the adventures of the adventurous Tom Sawer and his friends i've read this book so many times that i lost count it's easy to get caught up in books like this it is such a good book that you won't want to put it away
1,Not as pictured.,"This book has your standard cover, it does not have a textured leathery or otherwise palpable cover. It is the normal smooth thin cardboard paperback cover. To me the picture makes it seem otherwise."
5,Best book I ever read,I am 64 and had not read this book since I was in school. I never finished it then. I was riveted to my chair while reading it last month. I felt like I was part of the adventure. There is so much humor in this book. I ordered Huck Finn with this book but Huck Finn came first so I ended up reading Tom Sawyer second. I wished I had read it first. You cannot go wrong with this American Classic.
1,maybe ten years later,"Sorry I'm only ESL . I don't understand what the book talk about ,for me is nothing ,i will deleted it read it after 10 years when my english is better"
2,boring but classic,This book was extremely boring but I would understand how some people would like it since it is an all time classic. I am 3/4 of the way done and I hope that it gets better than it is now.
3,MUST READ THIS BOOK,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is an ok book because i had to read it in class to pass the seventh grade. I guess i liked the book because it taught me how fun it really would have been without having a TV to watch. Also the book showed me how people used to live back in the day. Another reason i liked the book was because it was almost talking about all the trouble i always get in trouble with my parents.All in all i guess the book was really good.
4,Tom Sawyer: A Pretty Nice Book,"I think this book is a cool book! I found out when I started reading the book, that Tom Sawyer was a trouble-maker. I thought the book would be stupid but the book came out to be good! It says that he flirts with two girls in school, Amy and Becky. Then it says how he got his Bible and the rest of the stuff. i thought it was a great book!"
4,now i know why this is such a classic!,"the vivid way in wich mark twain makes relive tom's life makes him one of the greatest writter ever! anyway, it's more a story for kids..."
3,The book,"Have not read it yet. I had to rate to read, but it seems pretty good. We shall see i guess."
5,Tom Sawyer,awesomeit was a great read. very funny and witty it is easy to love and hate tom sawyer throughout the book.
4,Chin gadget,T hehehe bedbug bc ggccvcv ggccvcv cc c.f. vfb th c.f. chin gg ggccvcv duff d B-) ggccvcv B-) bc
4,great book. grandkids like the stories.,These book and great for anyone wanting to be introduced to the classics. The book are hardcovered and well illustrated. Our family enjoys all the books.
4,TheAdventures of Tom Sawyer - Revisited,"Recently decided to re-read some of the classic stories from my childhood, this being one of them. It was first read when I was under ten years of age and not since, although I seem to remember watching one movie version, a very old one, I think starring Mickey Rooney.I have found it almost as entertaining as I did all those years ago, with its descriptions of childhood behaviour and pranks, particularly when 'Tom' meets a new boy in town, who is much better dressed and apparently from a more 'well-off' family. The threats such as ""my brother could thrash you, with one hand behind his back"" etc are so amusing and it is so well written that the reader can easily take an instant dislike to this 'new kid' and be delighted when Tom eventually comes out on top, in the ensuing struggle.Thoroughly enjoyed this return to my childhood and can recommend this book to adult or child."
5,Kick Butt Book,"This is a great work of literature that we enjoyed a lot. Though it is an especially good book for younger ages, we think it could also be good reading for adults. The southern dialect may be hard to read sometimes but it is still enjoyable. It is a great adventure story that was worderfully written by Mark Twain. There is much suspense that will keep your eyes glued to the pages. We hope you will read this book and enjoy it."
3,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,Very difficult to get interested in. The language was a barrier. Did not get very far into the book and put it down. Will try to read again later on.
4,"Nice that its free, but not the original","I loved reading this book in school. This version is still pretty close to the classic, but it is not the original. However, you can't go wrong with the price."
3,Tom Sawyer,"Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Searched for illustrated version. I have a 1st grader with ADHD, but reading at 5th grade level. Criteria for books include a lot of pictures. This version popped up as illustrated classic. No pictures at all. He wont read this now, but we'll keep it till he does."
3,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a good book. It's a great for all ages. It shows how some people are cruel to some people when they think they did something they did'nt and when they realize they did'nt they are very very sorry that they took the other peoples advice. Sometimes when they judge someone it's too late to make it up because they were already killed.Tom Sawyer is about a miscevious boy and a run-away boy. They witness a murder in a graveyard and are afraid to tell anyone because the guy who actually killed the other guy is a scary man. They don't think he would hesitate to kill them when he alread y killed someone else. It is a murder story and at the same time a love story. He falls in love with a girl named Becky Thatcher. Tom and Huch are on a time limit to tell or let an innocent person hang for a crime he did'nt even commit. Well i'll tell you what happens...NOT! You'll have to buy it or check it out at a library and read it for yourself!
3,A Very Good Book,"Tom Sawyer, written by Mark Twain, is about a boy growing in Missouri in a small town in the late 1800's. He has a lot of adventures with his friend Huckeberry Finn; and he ends up witnessing a muder late at night. Tom dosen't know if he should tell someone.I read the book and I thought it was good. I would give 3 stars. It was better than I expected . I thought it would be really boring. I really suggest this book for any reader and this is my opion."
4,Book Review,"This book, considered one of the classics of American Literature, tells the story of Thomas Sawyer, a mischievous boy who gets in many troubles and adventures together with his friends Huckleberry Finn, Joe Harper, and his beloved girlfriend from school, Becky Thatcher.Tom lives with his aunt Polly, his sister Mary and his well-behaved younger brother Sid, who always sneaks on him. He is a very playful and imaginative kid, whose games of pirate and Indian sometimes go far beyond the limits of imagination and take a much more real stance.Mark Twain explores Tom's mind as a child, exposing its dreams and weaknesses, taking the reader back to his childhood memories and making this book a must-read classic for all ages."
5,Judy's books,"Had never read this book, got interested when we visited Hannibal Missouri a couple summers ago and decided it was time to read about Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. I enjoyed the book very much. Another book to read before you die."
4,A book full of adventures,"Very Interesting book and i would recommend to any children who like adventures...Especilaly during school holiday when young child are free, they can read this book and see how life was in the 1800"
3,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,This book is for a child 8 to 9 years old. This book is alright for children this age but it doesn't contain the whole unabridged version.
5,A Great Classic,"I read this back in high school some 50+ years ago so there was a lot I forgot and kept getting it mixed up with Huckleberry Finn but I enjoyed reading it after all these years. Sometimes it's nice to go back and read the classics, they're written so differently from today's books."
5,Never Gets Old,"I never grow tired of reading Twain's classic, and I'm glad this edition is available for free. Every American should read this if they haven't already."
5,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Review,This book really took me by surprise. My dad told me to read it and it was really good. I think many older or even young children will love this book.
4,Great book,"loved the book, would not be his best book in my opinion, great read, have read most of this author's books"
4,Heck of a Fun Tale,"Heck of a fun tale. No great meaning behind it, though. In fact, Twain basically killed this character in Huckleberry Finn, using him as a symbol for then contemporary society and its silly rules, like slavery. Can't help thinking about that when I look back on this."
4,"Tom has many adventures & he makes clubs, friends, and more.","He has to live with his Aunt Polly because his parents died. He goes to school just like any boy in the 1800's at that time. During that time, he learn to survive in a dark cave for two weeks without food or drink. He also became friends with a boy named Huck Finn who is a trouble maker to the town but a friend that will make the story complete. The clubs that he makes will become unforgetable to the reader who is not going to forget this book. Now imagine that you are in a cave with Tom who will lead you on a daring adventure that will stay in your mind for the rest of your life."
5,Don't forget,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer os a wonderful book. It reminds us of what it was like to be a kid, adventuresome and mischievious. Twain. I beleive, is trying to tell readers not to forget what it was like to be young and don't forget to have fun with your life."
4,Great book!,"Mark Twain's Adventures of Tom Sawyer is truly an American classic. I enjoyed how he was able to capture the spirit of childhood within his writing. The stories that he told of young Tom were funny and very enjoyable to read. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys comedies, stories about childhood, or anyone who likes other works by Twain early in his career."
5,Excellent,Mark Twain's most famous novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a work of enduring excellence. It is a novel that can be appreciated by generations because of the universal themes it reveals to its readers. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer should be recommended to readers of all ages. Its inspiring and enjoyable stories make it an excellent novel.
4,Read This Book,"In the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer there were several things that I found interesting. One thing was that Tom would sometimes get in trouble at school on purpose, because the punishment was to sit with the girls. He did'nt seem to mind either especially when he got to sit beside Becky Thatcher, who he had a major crush on in the story. He would always try to show off in front of her.I would definately recommend this book. I think the book has a lot of exsiting moments in it. If your someone who likes adventure in what you read you should read this book."
4,Tom Sawyer,A boy who is just like a present day Dennis the Mennis. Tom sawyer is a fun and mischeivious kid who hasn't a care in the world. This book i would recommend for the middle schoolers because of the dialect of the writing. Elementary kids would have a hard time grasping the style and completely understanding it. Tom Sawyer has a great storyline with it switching from point-of-views every once in a while. It is definitly a page turner and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This book is a very good shows of Mark Twain's passion and love of writing.
4,Read It Read It Read It!,"Tom Sawyer was a great book. Mark Twain, the author, does a wonderful job on this book. The way he writes this book it would be good for preteens and teens. this would be good for preteens and teens because of the way Twain writes this book.This story is about Tom and his adventures. In the second chapter you get Tom and his mischievous ways. He tricks his friends into whitewashing the fence. When Tom's sick he pours his painkiller to the cat. Becky Thatcher, his girlfriend, gets lost in the cave with Tom. These are some of the adventures of Tom Sawyer.In this book I learned how it was like to be a kid in the 1840's. how I should just have fun"
4,The mischevious Boy,"In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Tom the main character was a very mischevious boy because he always got into trouble and always thought he was innocent when he wasn't. All though the book really focuses on his behavior toward life and the things he experiences everyday. Soon enough he will realize that the thing he is searching for isn't that impotant as he thought it would be. I enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who is into adventure, mysteries, good endings and sometimes a good laugh."
1,Please don't read this book if you don't have to,"I had to read this book for school, and out of over 100 people in my class I don't know anyone that even liked this book. Everyone hated it. It was bad. I can't understand why anyone would give this book FIVE stars! It may be a classic, but it was so boring. Mark Twain gives way to many details about things that don't matter, and it seems like he always goes off the subject. It is hard to understand."
2,I FELL ASLEEP EACH TIME I READ A PAGE! Z zzz ZzZz,this book reeked ...it wasnt exciting at all..i tried really hard to read it becuz i had to do a report on it but i didnt enjoy reading it.This made it hard for me to do my report.I recommend u should read another book besides this one.
1,Really boring,"I was forced to read this book for school and found it totally uninteresting. Probably because I like the complete opposite type of books: sci-fi and fantasy. But in my opinion the characters of this book were complete idiots, and usually I prefer smart characters. I do not stand alone here, most of my friends and most of the other reviewers agree with me. I do not recommend this book unless you enjoy the mostly-made-up adventures of young boys who enjoy playing with dead rats on strings. This probably won't be a very helpful review, will it? I do recommend it though if for some reason you feel the need to read every single book which is considered ""classic"" literature. Personally, I cannot see how Tom Sawyer fits into the ""classic"" catergory at all."
1,Tom Saywer is BORING,"This book is very dull and boring which can put the reader to sleep. Tis is because reading these events would take up pages and the evens just happen at a snails pace. If you love reading or easily entertained, I recommend this book to you. If you like action, this book might be for you because even though its boring, it still has it's exciting parts. But for teenagerslike myself, DON'T READ IT, YOU WILL REGRET IT."
4,Superb!,I have an older copy of this book and I find it to be the most interesting poetic book I have ever encountered. The book was property of my belated grandfather and it means the world to my entire family. I find that he shows a wonderful view of all the points in life that we come in contact with. I recommend this book to anyone with an open view of life because this book is the life of a very talented man. He shows all aspects of situations and feelings that we all go through in life.
5,wonderful,"this book has a lot more value to me than anything. my grandpa used to recite these poems to us grandkids, and now i've lost him. and this book is just so wonderful. it's in great condition, and i just love it!! thank you amazon!"
4,Very well built,I purchased this for a Christmas gift. I personally have had mine for appox 15 yrs and never had any problems. Could not have asked for a better price when I purchased it. The speed of the delivery was also way above expectation. I have never had a problem when ordering from Amazon.
4,KitchenAid Mixer,"Bought it for a Christmas present, great! Not too big or bulky and works really well. Easy to use, clean and store."
4,User Friendly,"I really was unsure how this thing would be. I had mine for many, many years. I kept mine just in case. Here it is so many months later and I just gave mine away!! This is a great machine and I find it user friendly."
3,"Functional, but poor quality construction","When I first bought this mixer, I was very impressed. It mixed my weekly pizza well. I was a little annoyed by the poor fit of the non-functional silver name band, but dismissed it as a quirk rather than evidence of other problems.Since I wrote my original review (which I had to delete so I could reduce my rating) the gears stripped out when mixing dough one weekend after the warranty had expired. The locking mechanism of the bowl is poorly designed and has progressively gotten worse in time until it simply cannot mix anything thicker than mashed potatoes.* * * *Since I wrote this, I purchased a new bowl and it made a world of difference. I bumped the review to three stars. I'm still disappointed with the plastic gears and the locking mechanism. On the other hand, there aren't many alternatives at this price."
5,Great Mixer-Great Mixer Bible,I've had this mixer for a year and barely used it. I just wasn't much of a baker. My husband gave me The Mixer Bible for Valentine's Day and I can't believe what a difference it has made in my kitchen! All of a sudden I am making beautiful muffins and biscuits in no time flat. I love my mixer now. Everyone who has this mixer should have the book to go with it.
5,LOVE it,"So, i bought this mixer because i have two hand held mixers and it's about time i get a stand mixer. To me, kitchenaid stands for quality, so that's why i purchased this brand. So far, it has worked great. I love the look of it, although i wanted red, but then i would've had to get an artisan and it's more expensive. But for my purposes, white is just fine. I love how fast i can make things with this mixer. Egg whites stiffen up fast and very stiff. I never got that that level of stiffness with the hand held mixer. So, i'm really happy with my purchase."
2,disappointing,"under power, if you try to make bread, or grind with attachment. head is loose, so bad i did call the company, i was told its normal. i don't think so, i have it for few years now, but each time i'm using it i'm anticipating the head crushing down.overrated.nice look indeed."
1,I bought one like mine for my daughter,This machine is the same model that I bought for myself years ago. When I went to help my daughter learn how to use it. The motor was very noticeably weaker than mine. Other than that it looks exactly a like.It also did NOT come with any book or warranty papers.
3,Okay if you don't use it often!,"I got this mixer thinking that it would be a great time saver. At first it was, but I have not even had it a full year now and it shakes and makes all sorts of ratteling noises. I make alot of doughs, pastas and cakes. It would be great for someone who wants to use it lightly."
2,go for a more powerful version!,"I bought this when my friend took back her 5 qt. Ultra that I had on long-term loan. I had become dependent on the thing, you see! Alas, I could only afford the 250 Watt, 4 1/2 Cup version. What a disappointment!!! It barely holds a single small batch of cookie or bread dough, overheating & straining with that. Also, don't bother with buying a pour shield- Something about the shape of the 4 1/2 qt. mixing bowl sends everything up & out, unlike the bigger bowl on the more powerful version. (The pour shield is engineered with openings along the edge which allow the flour or liquids to still gush all over.) The mixing paddles & what-not don't mix the entire bowl on this version, either, so you have to do a bunch of stopping & scraping the sides which is unecessary with the bigger one. Pay more (try refurbished!)for the better one- you won't regret it."
3,Kitchen Aid response,"I have a large stand mixer and hand held mixer by Kitchen Aid. I have had both for years. When I first used my stand mixer, I noticed power surges when it was running in most of the medium speeds. I took it in for repair and they said it had most likely been hit by a power surge caused by lightning. I explained that it was plugged in to a surge protector. Shortly after I got my mixer back, the problem started again. I called them about it and they did not return my call. Then I received my hand mixer as a gift. While it works well, the beaters will not stay in the mixer if it is raised. I e-mailed the company and got no response. While I feel that Kitched Aid makes a good quality mixer, it appears to me that they are more interested in sales than they are in customer satisfaction. Consequently, I will not purchase another Kitchen Aid product."
1,Do you like Motor Oil in your food? Then this is for you!,"I own a KitchenAid mixer - which I loved until Motor Oil started leaking into my food. Just do a quick internet search on Kitchen Aid leaking oil and you'll get plenty of information - in particular that the company won't do anything about it, other than tell you to use your mixer more often. Give me a break!! Everytime I use it, I sit with paper toweling to catch the oil before it gets into the food. No more Kitchen Aid or Whirlpool products in my house."
3,great product but arrived scratched,This is a very good product and Amazon has the best price however the item arrived scratched because was not properly packed-possibly the open item.
3,Kichen Aid Mixer,This mixer is adequate but it vibrates on the higher settings and doesn't mix as well as my 46 year old Sunbeam Mixer before it died.
5,A gift,"I bought this mixer as a gift for my best friend for Christmas. It shipped quickly and arrived in good shape! While she hasn't had a chance to use it yet, I have had one just like it for years and I love it! It takes a lickin and keeps on mixin!!"
5,I ordered the wrong color and can't change my order,I'm sure the Kitchen aid mixer is fine but I ordered the wrong color and can't figure out how to change the order. I wanted the colbalt blue. It is the unfixable one click buying button that is too close to the add to cart button that is the problem. What a headache!
1,never received,Didn't understand why a product would still be on your web site for availability when product was already sold.
5,Great Product,I love these kitchen aid mixers they are great for all kinds of things. I use it all the time.
5,Borgis,Excellent product; excellent condition and excellent packaging; all accessories fit well; even non skid rubber pads on the base were like new. I will have no problem recommending this to others.
5,The best Kitchen mixer,The Kitchen Aid mixers always were built for a lifetime... They still are. We love it!
2,Item received condition unsatisfied,"The machine functioned well, but the package condition upon receipt was very unsatisfying.1.Styrofoan inside the package was partly damaged.2.The cake mixer sample included was apparently cut open by a sharp object; the flour and sugar was all over the place inside the box and on the machine (including the gap, the motor).3.Scratches were found on the surface of the Mixer.This item might not have been used, but was apparently not in brand new condition. I didn't want to spend time looking for packing material or else I would have returned it if the styrofoan was intact."
2,expensive and does not work,"I purchased this for my daughter, we have had Kitchen Aide Mixers in our kitchen for years. The one we received does not work on the first two settings and only works on high. For the money we spent, I would like to send it back and get a new replacement. I am having a hard time reaching anyone in Amazon that can help me with the transaction. We had a temporary membership during the holidays, and were concidering joining but will hold off until I see Amazon will make good on this purchase."
3,reparautur mglichkaieten,ich möchte gleich berichten das ich keine glück mit meinen Kitchen Aid hatte er hat einen kinder krankheit und dauernt kaputt ich benutze es fürs teig vorbreitung und er macht regelmässig schlapp irgend wann steckt er fest ob vohl das motor greusch vorhanden ist kann er die rühr grät nicht umdrehen wir haben es seit 1999 und diese fehler war von ersten tag an da .Kann mir jemand sagen wo hier in hamburg einen reparatur möglichkeiten gibtmit freundlich grüssentülay saiti
1,unfortunately one of the 2 Kitchenaid was broken when arrives,"It is a little bit riskly if the store selling the product is not known, in my case i bought 2 of those products, but one of them arrived broken, i imported to Mexico city and the local dealer, could not accept the warranty, so i think we need to reinforce our global marketing if not people will never buy more products.... now for me is not easy to handle, because i can not return the product because it could be more expensive to do it that trying to fix it locally.... well that is my comment for today..."
1,Cheaper at Walmart,This is a very nice mixer. I would love to own and use it but It is alot cheaper at Walmart.
4,Every kitchen needs a mixer,This is the basic mixer that every kitchen needs. Works as expected. The white color looks nice and clean. Very fast delivery from Amazon.
1,A piece of junk to avoid,"After 18 months of occasional use the mixer died in a show of smoke and sparks. Kitchenaid says the warranty is 12 months, so ""tough luck""."
1,Disappointed beyond measure,"My Classic KitchenAid has just given up the ghost. I have used it lightly for 3 to 4 years, and beating egg whites it just stopped working! When I dropped it off for repair, the technicians said that the newer models don't last as long because many of the internals are made of plastic. This is just not good enough. I think once it is repaired, I'll sell it and buy something that will hopefully last."
2,Disappointed,"I'm disppointed. As others have said, it's lousy for breadmaking: the mixer jumps around when you mix bread and afterwards the bowl is next to impossible to remove. It's okay for cakes, I guess. I haven't tried cookies, but I suspect I may have similar problems with any stiff dough. A previous reviewer said KitchenAid said this model wasn't intended to use more than 4 minutes and wasn't intended for bread. At nearly $200? I'm thinking of selling it -- Anyone want to buy a used KitchenAid Classic?"
2,OK until it dies,Worked fine under very light use for four years. Kept extremely clean and maintained. And then it just died. Not built for longevity. The repair shop said it's not worth fixing because Kitchenaid prices its parts very high. RIP.
4,Love it!,"I've only used my mixer a couple of times, but each time I'm thankful that I chose the stand mixer. I was really concerned about using up my counter space, however, I found a little corner and it fits perfect! It's so convenient to be able to walk away and do other kitchen duties while it's doing it's job. All these years, I've always had a little hand held mixer. My main regret is that it took me so long in purchasing this one! I've got a lot of KitchenAid appliances and have been very satisfied with each and every one of them. I'm very pleased with my choice!"
4,Strong mixer,"I think this is the starting (cheapest) model of KitchenAid mixers, but it's definitely good enough for me. I mostly use it for cookies & cakes, though I've made pizza dough in it a couple of times. It's definitely strong enough for any task I might need it for. BUT, and here is the BUT, it doesn't do a good job of reaching the bottom of the mixing bowl. For example, if I need it to beat a couple of eggs, it really can't (I use a whisk instead). You also need to keep pushing down the dough that accumulates on the side of the bowl if you want an even mix. But this is my first standing mixer, and for all I know, that's a problem with all of them. In all, I really like it and would buy it again."
5,My last Kitchenaid mixer lasted 50 years!,"My last Kitchenaid mixer lasted 50 years! Literally. When my mother passed away, I kept the Kitchenaid mixer that she had used as I was growing up. I used it another 5 years, making over 50 years of use. It was still working when I dropped and broke the glass bowl. Because the mixer was SO OLD, parts were no longer available and the bowl could not be replaced, so I retired the mixer and bought another Kitchenaid. I have used that one for 5 years, so far, and I am now buying this one for my adult daughter to show her what QUALITY is all about!"
5,If you are considering this as a gift for someone... buy it!,"For anyone who likes freshly baked cookies, this is a great product. I have been in cookie heaven since getting this for my girlfriend 6 months ago and she is equelly thrilled with it."
1,KitchenAid Mixer - Dented and Scratched,"While the KitchenAid I ordered through Amazon works fine, it was very poorly packaged and came with scratches and dents. The ad had claimed that it was factory finished, instead, the mixer clearly appears used and abused. I'm glad that I have my KitchenAid, but it was a disappointing purchase."
4,Irma J. Miller,"I love my Kitchen Aid mixer. I had one for over 30 years and it finally died. If this one lasts half that long, I'll not need a new one. Thank you kitchen Aid"
1,KitchenAid Mixer VERY POOR QUALITY,I mistakenly thought I was buying a quality product. My mixer leaks oil into the bowl. KitchenAid company is no help at all! Do not waste your money on this bad product.
3,Shipping was shakey,"Product was received in box with styrofoam packing smashed. . .pin that holds the mixer together (where it pivots to go up and down) was out of the socket - altho' when it was put back in, product worked. The mixer body was scratched. Still. . . for the price and proximity to holidays it was a good buy."
3,"Item is great, but packaging was....lacking.","I received my order on time, as was stated. However, the box came as is; no outer shipping box or even brown shipping paper to conceal this expensive item. Just a shipping label slapped on the side of the box. To make things worse, FedEx just knocked and left the package on my doorstep. Good thing I was home, as anyone could see this item's contents as plain as day!! I would definitely encourage the seller to make better choices when it comes to shipping an expensive item such as this."
2,Not Your Grandma's Mixer,"My first Kitchenaid mixer was a hand me down after my Grandma died. That mixer was great. I only broke do to abuse at the end of a hammer (don't ask). I replaced it with a newer model and was disappointed right away. This one does not handle bread dough, it over heats and rattles. Now just three years after I purchased it the mixer is dead. I will only run on the highest speed and the top part wobbles and the pin works it's way out. My mixer failed me on Thanksgiving day! I've hear that Hobart used to make this brand but now it's being made by whirlpool. I'm not going to buy another Kitchenaide."
1,Please check before shipping!!,"Poor packaging, bad smell on the machine, uncleaned, leaking oil, definitly not a new one like I ordered!! Very disappointed with it!!"
5,Never buy anthing else!,I currently own the KitchenAid K45SS. It was given to me as a wedding present over 25 years ago. I have never had any problems with this mixer. When my daughter recently asked for a mixer for christmas she requested the same one. I know that the purchase will last her for years to come as well. For the price.....this is a steal. Best prices for this Kitchen Aid Mixer.
4,Baking Again,though A bit big and somewhat heavy it's something this little woman can handle. I love using it and the price was terrific. Glad I bought it.
1,disappointed,"...My new Kitchenaid makes scraping the sides impossible until I first turn it off, unlock it and tilt mixer up. I have used the whisk attachment and because of the hump in the bottom of the bowl realized that scraping is necessary unless you want to leave unmixed product in the ""well"" surrounding the hump. I was mixing cake batter. I also had a hard time adding eggs while it was mixing, per the instructions, the bowl and whisk too close to permit adding eggs without dripping on the outside of the bowl. Now I have to, again, turn off the mixer, unlock it, tilt it and start again in reverse-place it back down, lock it, turn it on. What is the solution to avoid paying a hefty price for a product we have not used before? ..."
3,Making Bread,"I read some of the negative reviews on this product before I bought it. I would say that a prospective buyer should do the same. I made my first loaf of bread with it (the cool rise in the manual) and found the machine hesitating during the kneading of the warmed dough. It did this a couple of times. I don't think it is a stretch to caution that if one is going to use this for heavy bread making, one will find themselves at odds with the manufacturer over the stated limitations. So buyer beware!For other uses it's great!"
5,Great Mixer!,"This is the first mixer that I've actually owned, however I have used numerous ones before this purchase. KitchenAid is simply the best mixer out there and will last for a looong time! I'm very happy with my purchase and the delivery is fast!"
3,Bad First Try,"the first one we purchased didn't last long, and it was the industrial strength because I had heard the lesser power models like this one tend to overheat when using the sausage attachment with a lot to do. I never got the chance to find out at the power variable switch went out within the first 30 days we had it. We were lucky enough to get a refund. Wife decided to try again with the model above (so much for heavy sausage use)and so far it has performed excellent! Too bad we didn't get this excellent price!!"
5,KitchenAid mixer is the best.,This is the best thing in my kitchen. It is a pleasure to use. This was a gift because I have had mine for the past 13 years and I cannot live without it. It is well worth the price.
1,So FRUSTRATING!,"I was so excited to FINALLY get a KitchenAid mixer. Being on a student family budget, it was a big purchase for us! After hearing so many great things and reading 5 star reviews, I think I must have really gotten a dud. I will say that it is so nice to have an electric stand mixer. However, ours has given us a lot of problems every time I pull it out. Motor oil leaking into the food? Check. Bowl doesn't fit into the base? Check. When bowl finally gets into place, it won't ever come out without a strong man around? Check. Speeds up and slows down without being touched? Check. Doesn't handle bread dough very well? Check.I cannot use this without my husband around to help me get the bowl in and out. I have to watch carefully for leaking oil. I have to cut many recipes in half because it it too small and weak to handle them. I have found myself pulling out my hand mixer anytime I can get away with NOT using this. We should have held out for a better one."
5,The right mixer makes all the difference,Prior to owning a Kitchen Aid mixer I was not a baker at all. In fact I hated it (much to my husbands dismay) after buying me a different brand of stand mixer for Christmas and realizing that it was not worth the money he went ahead and invested in a Kitchen Aid the following year and he also noticed the difference in performance. I love the versatility the kitchen aid mixers provide as well! All the different attachments are a great bonus!Note to men... when your significant other asks for a specific brand of kitchen appliance there is probably a reason! Invest in it like you would invest in tools for your garage!!!
3,Amazon's price is not all it is cracked up to be,"...The pour chute is not included in the manufacturers box, by the way.The mixer does an adequate job on the usual mixing chores but tends to grind away at heavier jobs such as bread dough. It sometimes stalls on these jobs and needs to cool off for ten minutes or so before resuming.If you need to make stiff batters and bread doughs, look at the 300 or 350 watt models."
5,seasoned mixer,"This is a necessity for anyone who really cooks. I have have mine for 15 years and my mother in law has had hers for 30 years and still works great. We do wedding cakes, I have since gratuated to the biggest baddest model (6qt) this year, the regular would heat up while we beat the ""H"" out of our frosting. So I would put an ice pack on the motor and this would keep some of the heat from transferring to the frosting. Don't use this model for heavy dough making, but great for regular cooks. PS sears has better prices"
3,Hard to rate,"I received this machine as a gift 5 years ago and was very impressed. I love the convenience of not having to mix things by hand and it works wonders on almost eveything. It gets a great deal of use from someone who cooks and bakes quite frequently. My only concern is that not too long after I received it, it started leaking some type of oil from the rotating gears above the attachment. I would wipe it away thinking nothing about it until I would find some in the bowl after not using it for awhile. I still use it very cautiously, wiping away every drop I see so as not to let it get into the food. I've heard that this is a common complaint and wonder if the newer models have done anything to prevent this."
4,wanted one for years,"I have wanted a kitchen aid mixer for years and finally gave in. I love it. The only thing I did not like was making bread with the dough hook. I have only made one thing with the hook so I need to give it several more tries.....Georgia in Port Richey, Fl"
5,Kitchen Aid mixer,"I am very impressed with the quality of this mixer. When I made homemade cookies, I had to hand mix them. With this mixer, it took all the hard work out of making cookies and it was a joy to bake again. Anyone interested in a mixer, this is the brand to get. I give it 5 stars. It is one of the best kitchen products I have bought!"
5,KITCHENAID MIXER,I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS MIXER I ORDERED ONE FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW AND SEVERAL OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. AMAZON TRUELY HAS THE VERY BEST OF THE BEST BUYS
2,DIssapointed,"It is too heavy and bulky to return but so expensive; I am sad I am stuck with it. For starters the accessories are a few milimeters short and if you dont have a lot to mix you should use a hand mixer because you may not reach the batter, but far worse than that is that it is and has been since I purchased it, temperamental. I have to bang and smack it to start it up. I wonder how long until it doesnt work at all. Comedic but inneficient."
3,"Great performance, poor reliability",It did a wonderful job of mixing all kinds of dough for baked goods. And it breezed through the lesser tasks. But it lasted only 3 years. Leaking oil down the backside and very noisy. The repair is estimated at ... minimum. Very disappointing. Particularly since we do not use it with much frequency and have never used an attachment. We have a friend who has one that is 30 years old. ...
3,"Works well, but leaks oil","The mixer works well, but it leaks oil into the food. This seems to be a common issue for these mixers. The company says the oil is harmless, but it looks (and smells) really bad. I've had to toss out lots of batches of cookies and bread because of the oil."
5,excellent service,"I bought this mixer as a Christmas present for myself. I opened it up, used it to beat egg whites, and the motor died! It has a 1 year unlimited warranty so I called Kitchen Aid that day and they sent a replacement. I just dropped off the broken one (shipping paid by them) with FedEx. No drama, no nonsense. I received my replacement in less than a week and it works like the first one should have! As far as Amazon.com's involvement - Their shipping was quick, and I chose the free shipping option. I love amazon."
2,They don't make 'em like they used to,"We made the mistake of using the included dough hook to make bread. It didn't make it through the second batch, and while it still works it hasn't been the same since. It's leaked an oily substance ever since, and it's struggling to do some simple mixing jobs. The last time we had it out, the motor started to struggle while whipping egg whites for meringues. It's only 2-3 years old now, but I'll be surprised if we get 5 years use out of it."
5,Good deal,I love this mixer and Amazon had the best price anywhere. Amazon saves time and money for the consumer.
3,No Room for Scraping,"I use a mixer mostly for whipping potatos, jellos, sauces, etc. The design of the beaters/bowl is such that I can't put a spatula down the side of the bowl to scrape the edge and move material into the mix of things. I have to stop the mixer, raise the head, scrape to the center, lower the head and start it up again. So I bought a hand mixer which allows me to do what I want to do. Too bad I didn't buy it before I bought this mixer. If I ever decide to make thick, heavy batters or doughs, I'm sure this would be great, but it's not designed for what I do a lot of."
4,KITCHEN AID MIXER,"I ordered this thru Amazon. This is my first KitchenAid mixer. Due to the popularity of the Brand name I thought I would like it better than my other mixers, the last being a Kenmore that you can't get replacement parts for. The mixer does the job, I haven't had the time to use the dough hook or whip. It is easy to use and clean and the price was right. As usual, I am very glad I used Amazon to make my purchase. It is the best web site to use, very quick and efficent."
3,Opinion of Mixer,"This mixer is phenomenally heavy!!!! That is not a plus in my book. Also, it is almost impossible to scrape the sides of the bowl due to the action of the mixers. Also, the control for the speed is very hard to adjust."
4,This will make a great addition to the Kitchen,"This will make a great addition to our kitchen. I haven't used it myself, but my wife has and she loves it. Amazon has a great delivery whoever they use."
4,almost perfect,"my wife loved the mixed and only had one fault with it . the chrome around the base where the beater attatches started to peel off right away ,and right into what she was mixing.other than that the machine was and is in perfect working order.my mother still has her mixer which is the same as my wifes,and she has had it for at least 20 years."
5,KitchenAid Mixer,"Have had this since Thanksgiving and we have been very happy with it. We've made breads, doughs and batters and it flies thru all with the greatest of ease. I highly recommend it, and for the price we paid for it on Black Friday, I haven't found one cheaper since."
4,"Good Experience, But...","After buying a string of cheap mixers that all broke after about 1 year of use, I decided to invest some serious money in something that will last. The KitchenAid was the right choice - it comes with 3 different attachments that can handle any kind of dough, is easy to use, sturdy and fairly quiet. The KitchenAid makes Christmas baking much more fun!The negative thing about this KitchenAid is the inability of the attachments to reach the bottom of the bowl. This means that after mixing, I still have to manually scrape the ingredients from the bottom of the bowl and mix them in with the dough for everything to form a homogeneous mass."
5,love it!,"I originally gonna buy it from Macys, but even with the rebate Macys offer, this amazon deal is still better. This is my first Mixer, and i absolute love it, I don't bake often, so this is way enough for me."
4,kitchenaid,"I have used this stand mixer a few times. It's a whiz at beating egg whites. I don't think that I have the adjustment screw just right; but I'm working on it. The price was great. I managed to get this for $20.00 less that Wal-Mart's rollback price, which they didn't have in stock at the time, nor did the other store closest to me. Thank you for the Christmas present and for such a great deal. I'm hoping that this mixer and I have many good cake, bread, and cookie making days ahead of us."
4,Kitchenaid is one of a kind,If I want to eat then I have to do most of the cooking myself; its very simple. This is by far the best mixer I could have in my house. I read some other ratings and blogs one i dreaded was that the mixer sound like grinding gears which i do not agree with. So that was a worry i'm relieve of. other than that its a lot of spatula work incoporating everything in my batters. Easy cleaning and takes a lot of room. when theres a mix job to do accept no cheap copies. we always wanted an industrial mixer with all the cake we enjoy here at my home. We got this one at a steal in my opinion under hundered buckss on sale 240 watts of power which is a smaller wattage mixer than most other kitchen-aid mixers.
5,Great for tough jobs,I got this mixer for Christmas two years ago. I absolutely love it! It is great for making bread and tough doughs. I use it all the time and bake more often now that I have it. A definite must for any kitchen.
4,Adjustment is needed for proper mixing,"If the beater is not hitting the bottom of the bowl your mixer needs to be adjusted. On the K45 series there is a screw on the front of the joint when you tilt it back. Turn that screw clockwise (to the right)to tighten it and that will allow your blade to reach the bottom. If your blade starts hitting/rubbing the bowl, the screw should be turned back to the left until you find a happy medium. If the blade is hitting/rubbing you bowl it will damage your attatchments. Good luck. This is an older piece of equiptmant but built very well that should last a lifetime. My husband and I have a ""hand me down"" that has lasted 40 years!"
1,Not Large Print,"When I ordered the book I thought I was ordering large print, I can't read it, I have to return it for large print if you have it in large print. Thank You. Fran"
4,TRILOGY,ONE OF THE BEST WRITTEN BY NORA ROBERTS - LOVELY STORIES WITH GOOD CONTINUNITY HOPE ROBERTS WRITES MORE IN THE GARDEN SERIES
2,Very disappointed,"Nora Roberts has been one of my all time favorite authors ever since I read Genuine Lies. However, lately I've been very disappointed with her books, it seems as though she's rushing to get them done and doesn't put much effort into them. I thought so with the Key trilogy, then the garden trilogy came out and I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. I did that with all three books, but I think at the end I just read them to find out how the story would end, and not because I was caught up in it as used to happen with her other books. If you're a first time Nora Roberts reader, DO NOT start with these books, get the older ones, which are much much better."
5,.....,Good read. Would recommend to friends. I like the story line and he way the book keeps me wanting to read more
3,red lily,"This book did not keep me interested. it seems as though she rambles on then take you on a ""trip"" to nowhere. It did not tie the ""knot"" in many places in the book. This is not one of her better books."
2,"Done, Redone and Overdone","I began this trilogy with some enthusiasm as I'm an avid gardener and was happy to see 2 of my favorite pasttimes joined...fiction with gardening info. The first book was fine, the second ok (why are ghosts always so threatening to humans?) and this last a rehash of so many other Robert's books. The story line of the ghost inhabiting Hayley could have been taken directly from the Trilogy of Three Sisters Island, just substitute evil force with Amelia. This trilogy seemed to be more ""microwave"" than true creating by the author."
4,Red Lily,"Great delivery time....just as I finished Black Rose, Red Lily was here for me to listen to! Loved the accents; I'm from TN and the west TN accents were dead-on!"
4,Nail-Biting conclusion,"While I enjoyed all of the books in this series, I was a bit miffed by the ending of this particular book. I was hoping to hear more about Hayley and Harper and how they turned out. Hopefully, there will be some sort of sequel to this series in the future!"
4,Not as quick of a read...,"as I expected. Since I breezed through the first two books, this book dragged. It was very interesting and I love the surprise at the end, but I didn't care for the way the characters were left at the end. I wish Roberts would have gone on a little. It was a somewhat abrupt ending. I did like and very much enjoyed the series and plan to read more books by Roberts in the future."
3,Nora Roberts is consistent,"In this the final installment of the Garden Trilogy Ms. Roberts ties up all the loose strings quite nicely. I must say, for me, Hayley being so posessed by Amelia got a little bit too much for my imagination. When Amelia was just doing poltergueist type antics or showing up in mirrors or dreams I could buy it but taking over Hayley was a little too predictable and over the top, especially during the love making/rape of Harper scene. Nonetheless this is an author I always reach for when I want an enjoyable weekend getting away from it all!Thanks Nora"
3,Disappointing 3rd book in the Trilogy,"I love Nora Roberts and eagerly await her books and generally read them in one setting. This one, I had a hard time getting into, I kept putting it down to read later, it couldn't hold my attention. Unlike the first 2 books, I will not be rereading this one."
4,Southern Ghost Tale,"This is the last book of the In the Garden Trilogy. I didn't read the others, but found this one a good stand alone read. I listen to audio versions of books and this one is well done by Suzie Breck. I must say though that I nearly dumped the book after the prologue. I'm not into historical fiction and this one sounded really strange, opening with a mistress (Amelia Conner) coming to reclaim her child who has been stolen by his father in the 1890s. The book came highly recommended, so I thought I'd give it a chance though and I'm glad I did because starting in chapter one I understood where the book was going and the reason for the prologue. Even though I found the main character and Ghost posessed, Hayley to be somewhat of a crude flake at times, she was endearing and I enjoyed the warmth shared by her and the Harper family."
2,Red Lily,"The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it. It's a dud in my opinion."
4,A Pretty Good Book!!,"This is the conclusion of the Trilogy. It tells the story of Hayley Phillips, a young mother who came to Memphis to start a new life. What she finds is a new job, a beautiful home she shares with her distant cousin Roz and some new best friends. What she didn't count on was falling in love with Roz's son Harper. She also didn't count on being possessed by the family ghost. Through the many interactions with Amelia they find out what happened to her and they finally put her to rest. This was a pretty good book . The only thing I didn't like about this trilogy was the gardening descriptions which really bored me. I skipped those parts. Even though I did skip those parts I still liked it!! So it didn't keep me from enjoying it."
3,Genealogical glitch,"In this series, in the prior book, Mitch was presented as a genealogist helping the family identify the origins of its ghost. In this book, on p. 134 (pb ed.) he supposedly identifies the name of the ghost.From the 1890 census.Which burned and is not available for genealogical research.Okay, it's a romance novel. But, still, one expects more of a professional writer."
2,Another Disappointment,"This was the final book from the `In the Garden' trilogy and focused on the romance between Harper and Hailey. We all knew this match was forthcoming, but it was a major disappointment; Harper and Hailey were not particularly romantic together. It seemed, at least to me, that most of the book was focused on the Harper Ghost and Hailey's daughter, Lily. Although Harper and Hailey do `get together' in this book, most of the groundwork for their romance comes from the first two books. Aside from being pretty skimpy in terms of romance, this book was flat-out unbelievable. Hailey is `inhabited' by the Harper ghost during odd moments (like while having sex), and it was just too surreal to even make it good fiction. The entire trilogy was weak and I wouldn't recommend this book. I only finished it because I had read the first two."
3,Better than the first two,"BUT...still not her best work. After I finished Blue Dahlia, I was pretty lukewarm, but hey, it's Nora Roberts, so I bought and read Black Rose when it came out. I still wasn't sold, but I went ahead and got Red Lily as well. Now I wished I had listened to myself and spent the time reading something else!Is Roberts re-using characters? Hayley, Red Lily's main character, reminded me a lot of Zoe from Key of Valor (spunky single mom, wants the best for her child, etc.)The whole ghost thing with Amelia, and her possession of Hayley, got old.I have always enjoyed Roberts' writing, and have kept many of her books, but these are going to the secondhand store."
5,fascinating,"A great ending to a good series, I would definitely read more books from this author. I liked it a lot"
4,The Third Chapter,excellent end to the trilogy - you could read just this one but why would you do that - read all three
5,A fine end!,"This not a disappointing ending to the 3 books. It is different than the others and that is good. Read all three, you will love them."
4,"Good, but not excellent","I came away from this conclusion to Roberts' ""In the Garden"" trilogy a bit disappointed, but satisfied overall. There was just a bit too much of the stereotypical ghost behavior, although I was quite pleased at the different approach from the other two novels. The characters remain sympathetic and likable, although I think Hayley is just a bit too sicky sweet for my taste. The chemistry remains light and easy. The dénouement was a tiny bit anticlimactic, but the drama and excitement beforehand made up for it somewhat.All in all, a fitting end to an excellent trilogy by an author who rarely lets her readers down. While not one of Roberts' strongest series, it is quite enjoyable and memorable."
1,Extremely Disapointing,"I have never felt compelled to write a book review before, but certain aspects of this book are quite disapointing.Without giving away the entire plot of the book, Roberts completely sidesteps a huge moral issue. It is an important enough plot point that the rest of the book and the two earlier books in the trilogy now ring false.Additionally, the dialogue is ridiculous. Roberts has become so mannered with her character's dialogue that the book is full of one word sentences. I'm not sure how she expects that writing style to further the theme of the novel, but it is quite unsuccessful."
3,Trilogy Sucked,"The In the Garden trilogy was def not Nora Robert's best work, but I think she made up for it with Red Lily. The final book in the trilogy was good and reminded me of what a good author she is. I have to say Blood Brothers trilogy was way better though."
5,Red Lily is Terrific!,This is a great end to the trilogy. It kept your attention throughout the entire book. Very unexpected ending. Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors.
3,Still not Up To Par,"As with Blue Smoke, its pretty obvious the way things are going to turn out- ie, Haley with Harper. So there is no suspense there. The story of the ghost was much more interesting, but I do think Nora has trouble writing unlikable characters. The ghost becomes so appalling you are to be glad she was killed. Most people have alot of the gray area- her bad characters do not seem to. This trilogy was dissappointing to me- I did not feel transported to the world of the characters. Still, as always, any Nora book is a good book, but she has spoiled us with so many good ones, we notice the not so good ones."
3,"a good read but not a ""keeper""","I read it, I enjoyed it, but there are many other better Roberts' books worth reading over and over. Not a keeper."
4,Not so much romance as mystery,"I too, like most who've read the first two books, eagerly awaited Red Lily. I was glad Roberts didn't spend the whole book with Haley and Harper pining for each other--she was straightforward and to the point with that. The book though focused on the more important plot line--that of discovering who Amelia Conner was and what happened to her. I love all Roberts books and wasn't disappointed by this one."
4,Risk & Resilience on Childhood Specific Issues,"This book reviews the theoretical constructs of risk and resilience and goes on to discuss specific childhood issues' risk and protective factors. Easy to read and enjoyed by graduate students as an introduction to this literature. The book utilizes an ecosystemic approach and examines the child, family, and community aspects of each concern. Use this book to spark interest in the resilience literature."
1,all vegetarian,"Be aware that this collection is all vegetarian, making heavy use of a variety of soy products. The description is a bit misleading, and neglects to emphasize this. I've made one extremely disappointing recipe, and doubt I'll be tempted to try much else."
3,Trudged through 60%,"I genuinely tried to finish this book, but I could only make it 60% of the way through. There's much to admire and ponder in the philosophy of the good doctor, and there may be lessons here for a USA in decline. Alas, if only Balzac could have included a plot, and at least a hint of conflict with hope of a climax and resolution, the book might have kept my interest.If I return to read the rest of the book, it will be due to gems like these:""The peasant is always more willing to listen to the man who lays down rules for saving him from bodily ills than to the priest who exhorts him to save his soul.""""Religion forms the only adequate safeguard against the abuse of supreme power. When a nation ceases to believe in religion, it becomes ungovernable in consequence, and its prince perforce becomes a tyrant."""
1,KitchenAid SNPA Pasta Maker Plates for Food Grinder,"I wish I hadn't of bought this. I read another review where they said smoke was coming out of their mixer. I thought towards the end of making pasta with these attachments, that mine too would burn up the motor. I have the pasta rollers and cutters. More expensive but soooo much easier to work with and less stress on your mixer."
2,Not so hot,"After reading the negative reviews for this product, I decided to get it anyway - sure that ""they"" did not follow the directions. I should have listened. Pasta sticks together, clumps and is generally no better than the truly less expensive pasta I can buy at the store. I look forward to adding the pasta roller/cutters to my kitchen."
1,Save your money,I bought for my machine. The pasta that comes out is too thin and breaks. I am a professional chef and I would not use this in my resturant. Save your money.
1,NOT WORTHY OF THE KITCHENAID NAME,"I had nothing but bad luck trying to make pasta with this junk. The extruded pasta stuck together and is really a pain to try to pick it apart. I tried tweeking the recipe that came in the manual but still no luck. Not worth the bother. I am getting a roller attachment for my mixer. Total waste of money, time and effort. KitchenAid should take this off the market."
1,Pasta work maker,"Save your money. I got a kitchen aid mixer last year and LOVE it. So I decided to try the pasta plates. It took forever to make the pasta, and was a very tedious process. I followed the recipe included to the letter, and it still didn't help. I plan to return the plates. Such a disappointment from such a great mixer company!"
1,"If you LOVE your KitchenAid Stand Mixer...this is a no,no!","I have a Profesional 6 model, and I did everything the recipe said for 1 batch of regular spaghetti pasta. It didn't kill the mixer, but the motor became very hot! I will never use it again. I also have the roto slicer/shredder, fruit/veggie strainer, food grinder & sausage stuffer attachments...none of these have even made my stand mixer very warm. --That tells me the pasta maker attachment is a bad product. I am thankful that my model is 525 watts...I could only imagine what would have happened if I had a classic 300 watt model!My best advice is to pick up an inexpensive pasta machine or an Emperia hand crank pasta machine. They run between $20-40 without a motor or $80-120 with a motor (that you can also buy separately for $50-80). --A very small price to pay, if you want to keep your KitchenAid Stand Mixer!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Even if you already own the food grinder don't waste your money on the pasta attachment. Since this is more of an extrusion pasta maker, the pasta does not get the nice thin texture that is necessary in fresh pasta. I made lasagna noodles from this attachment and had to roll out every noodle by hand after it had been extruded because it wasn't thin enough.If you love fresh pasta, as I do, you would be better off buying the actual stainless steel, traditional pasta roller attachment for your kitchen aid. It is more expensive, but well worth the extra money. I use this attachment all the time and always get the results that I am looking for. When my husband purchased the pasta attachment it came as a set with the food grinder. The food grinder is awesome."
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this right after I got my Kitchen-Aid, and a week later went out and bought a manual pasta roller for $39.00. As others have said, the noodles stick together, and you don't get as good a consistency as you do by rolling them out. Go with a roller, not this."
4,I've seen better,This works ok. it's fairly easy and makes a decent pasta...However this does not work as well as the pasta rollers as the pasta tends to get stuck together after being extruded.I think the issues i saw with this are probably all just limitations of extruding pasta machines.my final verdict is that you should just go out and buy a pasta roller instead those work great.
2,A sticky situation,I bought this product before the pasta roller was available. I find it very hard to keep the pasta strands from sticking together as they come through the grid plate. I would definately pay a little more and go with the pasta roller.
1,hardly useful,"i agree with other reviewers ,it is barely adequate for lasagne and fettucini noodles, but I have never been able to use it to make spagetti no matter how i ""tweaked"" the recipe. All the other attachments I have for my mixer are very functional and I use the attachments on a regular basis. I have had these plates for about 15 years and even though I am an avid cook I have tried to use them about 5 times, always with poor results. Kitchenaid, stop selling this!!"
3,"Takes some practice, but great results!","This is the first pasta maker I have ever used and I am pleased with the results. It is easy to use and clean; and once I figured out the right dough recipe (drier than I would have thought) the results have been great! I have even used it for angel hair and I didn't have a problem with sticking. I think you need to make sure to let the pasta dry for at least fifteen minutes before boiling for best results. I bought this with the food grinder attachment, so it was a great deal."
1,Save your money,"I used this once, re-boxed it and then relegated it to the back of my pantry. I would have returned it but just never got around to it. It is impossible to make pasta with this attachment. My husband gave me a hand-cranked Al Dente brand maker that I love."
1,Atlas is better for me,I have a 350 watt machine thats about 12 years old and it could not even pull the dough to knead it (of course it can't even pull a double batch of cookie dough). The machine stopped on me. I make homemade pasta often and ended up finishing the dough it by hand. Then tried to put the dough through the pasta maker and it stuck together. It couldn't handle the dough any stiffer because it would stop on me. Ended up getting my Atlas out and finished up the pasta as usual. My Mother has a 525 watt Pro series machine thats 2 years old and it pulled it with no problem.
1,Don't waste your money,"The dough gets stuck in the funnel. When the pasta comes out it is all stuck together. Very hard to clean. Heats up the motor. PLUS, it's useless unless you first invest in the expensive grinder attachment. This attachment is not up to KitchenAid standards."
5,Nice set.,"Love the container that holds all the blades, bowl clips, etc. in one place. It keeps it all together, so I'm not constantly looking and rummaging through drawers to find the parts. However, I was not aware that I needed the grinder to be able to use these blades. I thought they were add ons for my pasta rollers (duh! right?) Anyway, I had to order the grinder before using these blades. I just received the grinder, so have not had a chance to use the blades yet. I am, however, looking forward to using this set, especially with the price of pasta going sky high along with all the rest of the groceries. (THANK YOU OIL COMPANIES!!!)"
3,Not bad,"This product is an extrusion pasta maker, as opposed to the stainless steel pasta rollers. I have both, and would say that the rollers produce a better overall product, and are actually easier to use.If you are only going to use the attachement occasionally, or just want to get your feet wet in homemade pasta, this is not a bad product to get, assuming that you already have the food grinder attachment. Also fun to use with little kids who like seeing the pasta get mashed out.Should you decide you enjoy it, you can always get the pasta rollers later."
1,Unsatisified,All other kitchen aid products are marvelous but this one is not. Burned up my stand mixer. Have also heard this problem from others using this product. Will not use this item again. But WILL continue to purchase other Kitchen Aid products.
4,Homemade pasta is soooooo much better,"Even though it took a few wasted batches of dough to get the right consistency, we prefer the homemade pasta to the dry who-knows-how-old stuff from the store. It is fast and easy to make. From start to eating, I can make spaghetti in around 30 minutes. And clean up is a snap. Just throw everything into the dishwasher and that's it. What could be easier?"
4,slow but fun.,It is a slow process but does work. You have to let the dough rest for 15 minutes. Fresh dough does not work.
1,A waste of money (from a company that KNOWS better),"I love my mixer (this is my second kitchenaid; I upgraded from the low-end model and gave my mom the old one!) but I hate this accessory. I already had the meat grinder and figured that since we like pasta so much this would be a good investment. WRONG! It simply doesn't work. All the strands of pasta stick together as they come out of the holes, even when using the recommended/included recipe. Save your money and buy a hand-cranked fettuccine maker, or splurge and get a dedicated electric pasta machine."
4,"IF YOU WANT JAZZ THAT SWINGS HARD, THIS ALBUM IS IT","This stellar album features former Basie Alumni Illinois Jacquet along side with Roy Eldridge. Jacquet's tenor sax plays multiple roles, such as the mean, classic Texas Tenor and a soft, gentle, light, and airy Paul Desmond like sound. But Jacquet's tenor is not the only part, the energetic Roy Eldridge never disappoints as he regularly nails the high notes. Best of all, this entire album swings like crazy, as the rhythm section lays down a masterful groove! Classic songs like Satin Doll and Indiana provide the strength of this 50 plus min. album. If you love the classic swing of the Baise sound, but want a small group to bring it to your level, this album is it!"
1,disappointing,"i had received recommendations for this album, but it was a huge disappointment and waste of money"
3,Phenomenon Not Phenomenal:,"I love Sylvia's books and have read most of them. I highly respect her as both a psychic and a human being. However, this book was one of the only of her's that dissapointed me. It seemed to be a bunch of copy and pasted stuff from all her other books.SO:I highly recommend it for new reader since it does offer such an immense ammount of info from all her other books.I do not recommend this book for avid readers of Sylvia's since it does tend to be a bit redundant and fans might get a little bit bored as I did =)"
4,so far so good...,"I didn't want to put the book down and i probably would have finished it but i had a newborn and a 3 year old wanting my attention.On page 148, it states that the land around Pacheco Pass (a stretch of highway 152 in Northern California) was part of the ""Trail of Tears,""I thought this is Northern Georgia history? There is a possibility that i'm wrong because i never attended my history class in highschool. Really, i didn't."
1,Garbage,"I would have expected this book to be one blank page long.Because that's all you need to know about the ""paranormal.""Because it's not real folks. Wake up and smell reality. All Sylvia wants is the hard-earned money from you idiots who buy her nonsense."
3,Interesting but very far out,"The book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Its content is broad and at times, very difficult to digest because it stretches the boundaries of credibility. However, it is still a good read and rather entertaining."
2,Isn't this just another postmodernist buzzwords book?,"I'd like to read the opinions of some fluid dynamicists, fractal geometers and quantitative ecologists on the ideas put forth in this book.Thanks in advance."
4,Quite Enjoyable,"Mystical Paths is my first experience with a Susan Howatch book. I found that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are solid, complex, very different, and interesting. I truly felt like these were people that I would like to get to know better.I won't reiterate the plot here, since other reviewers have done it well. I will just say that this book has elements that many readers will likely find enjoyable for pure fun reading: demonic possession, exorcism, mystery, and suspense. There are also complex elements for the reader that likes more meat to a story:guilt, pride, vocation, growing up, and parental relation complexs.My only very tiny complaint about this book is that in a few places it bogs down a bit, though it does tend to recover quickly. Overall, though, I highly recommend this book and will be seeking out the other titles in this series."
