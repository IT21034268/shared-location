2,Misleading,The picture and description are misleading. The only thing included is the u-shaped eyewash. We had to order another faucet system to work with the product. Overpriced for what you get.
3,Faucet Mount Eye Wash,Product was easy to install and doesn't leak when faucet is on as others have done. As lab expands we will order more of these as shipping was fast and install was easy. Thanks for your good service.
2,Acer 6206A (Discos quemados a medias),"Hace 5 meses que adquiri el el producto en cuestion, por recomendacion de un amigo. Lamento haber realizado la compra, la unidad CD-RW ademas de ser demasiado lenta (40 min a 1 hr por copia 600-650 MB)daña de 3 a 5 CD's de cada 10 que que pruebo."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I brought mine in January and have only been able to burn a total of six CD's. My CDRW has ruined over 20 CD's. The technecial support people are of no help. Acer sent me a new CDRW and I""m still having the same problems. It will write once in a blue moon, it locks up my system, It will test fine but when you go to do the real deal it just sits there or it will do half the disk and freeze up your system. I recommend that you do not buy this rewriter."
2,It's fine for music - Bad for big data,"I used my Acer for a CD production & came out ok. Levels are a bit wonky, though. I tried to back up the audio data files & have been working with tech support for 6 months. Getting no where. They aren't much help. I'd pay more & get something that works much better."
1,worked great for 3 days!,"It worked great for 3 days then wouldnt burn anymore cd's. It caused my regular cd-rom to stop working also. I've installed it on a few computeres to see if it wasnt just mine, and it did the same to the rest"
2,Its O.K. ......but Keep Looking.,"The Kaito C873 Description accurately describes the unit's features......HOWEVER, 1) Even when powered by an external AC Adapter (sold separately) the projected image remains faint and will not stay on continuously but only remains lit for 30 minutes (after depressing the Snooze button for 3 sec)....And 2) Here in the Boston area, the clock could not find sufficient Atomic Clock Signal from Boulder CO to synch time and date, even after the unit was AC powered, left on for 48 hrs and located on the second floor of a wood-frame house, away from potential sources of interference. I suggest you spend a few dollars more and look else where for a better projection clock......."
2,Not reliable!,The projector function of this projector clock failed after only two weeks! Bummer....
3,Pugster Italiam Charm,This a very cute charm. The detail is really great. My only complaint is that the ears tend to snag on clothing. I ended up having to take it off of my bracelet.
4,didn't work for me,Didn't work at all for me. Sat in my cabinent for a long time until I finally broke down and threw them away after they expired. I am sure it would work for some people based on my research. They just didn't work for me.
5,Small and good supplement,"I'm not sure about the benefits of this supplement so far. But, because of the vitamins in it, it's the first supplement I've taken a whole bottle of ever. Maybe because of the small size."
5,wonderful,I felt great after taking the product. When i ran out and had none left i was very tired and felt sluggish. This product is my new best friend.
4,No great but pretty good,"This album doesn't have the pop flavor that most Ramones products have. It's alright though. Dee Dee was a messy guy an dthis ablum is just like him. It has some classics: Fix yourself up, Keep away from my chico (w/ Barbara on vox), I've been seeing UFO's (x/ Joey on vox). Buy and love it. It true about the dead, love their gifts and love their curse otherwise your loving a dream. Dee Dee was a messy guy."
3,"Better luck tomorrow, so much sorrow.","This album by Dee Dee Ramone was released in 1997. It's sort of a family affair, with Dee Dee on guitar, Barbara Ramone on bass and Marky Ramone on drums (plus producer Daniel Rey on second guitar). Dee Dee sings most of the songs, with Barbara singing three songs and guest vocalists Joey Ramone and Lux Interior singing one song each. It's a decent album, with some good songs, and some songs that are just average. But Ramones fans should enjoy it."
4,Enjoyable If Slight Wish Fulfillment,"Ever wanted to murder someone? Your boss, your rival, your wife?Of course not.But if you'd ever thought of such a thing, you'd get a kick out of this nasty look at a completely unscrupulous, conscienceless cad who finds that murder is just the thing to ensure advancement in business and in life itself. I found this well-written and entertaining, though it lost some steam at the end.Note: A superior example of the same concept can be found in Donald E. Westlake's ""The Ax,"" which I recommend whole-heartedly."
4,Underrated,"First off, this film is only of interest to Fulci diehards. That being said, it's nowhere near his best work, The Beyond. Only those with a short attention span will find it boring, because it isn't propelled by gore. There is some, but nowhere near his other excesses, most notably the final death of the film. The music is good, but for some reason was pulled straight from The Beyond. The story centers around the possession of a young girl from an eye medallion she recieves in Egypt from an old woman with white eyes. The cycle seems to be continuous, with no true end to the eye, which houses an evil force that appears as white light. Like I said, Fulci diehards should seek it out, but it may be tedious to the unconverted."
4,an excellent example of fulcis imagination and craftmanship!,This film is magical right from the begining to the blood curdling end. Worth every penny! Fulci has got ideas from raiders of the lost ark in here but still manages to keep the film soley his own great vision.One of fulcis most stylistic films and great fun.
2,Horror film ?,"The entrance to the film was the only interesting and attention getting part of the film.The rest of the film was very disapointing considering that Fulcie was the director.The effects were so poorly executed that they spoiled the film.The film should have taken place entirely in Egypt.The Egyptian tombs and pyramids would have made a better back drop,instead of the appartment in New York City.As for the background music in the film,well to put it bluntly,it was terrible,it did nothing to intensify the horror scenes.The special effects were no where close to the exorcist.I was very disapointed with this film.It was not worth the money i shelled out for the DVD."
2,WELL...COULD BE WORSE!,"The daughter of a American Egyptologist falls under the influenceof a strange,eye-embossed amulet that can open the gateway intothe netherworld(Hey Lucio! That's a new one?!?) One of Lucio'smost restrained,and dull efforts! This does have a good scenewhere a man is clawed to death(don't you just LOVE IT)by stuffedbirds that suddenly come to life. Really not his best at all andonly for completes of that Grand Old Man of Itailian SPLATTER!I recommend the MASTERS works of THE BEYOND & ZOMBIE for greatFULCHI FOLCH."
1,Luicio Fulci at his worst,"Ripping off POLTERGEIST, THE EXORCIST, this dreadful Fulci film takes place in a dull Manhattan apartment where a family are the victim of an Egyptian curse. Dreadfully boring and makes little sense at times. There is nothing scary about this movie unless you are under five years old and are really gullible and afraid of things flying around on visible strings. Buy THE BEYOND instead even if you already own a copy."
4,Good showcase of American Composers.,"Shaham and Previn make great use of violin and piano to display a good selection of works by American Composer, including Gershwin, Copland and Barber. Recommended."
4,Best of,"The Best Of John Mayall-Bluesbreakers is a great album for that hit of sixties blues music. It starts with the superb 'Crawling Up A Hill' and goes from strength to strength. You get examples of all the most famous guitarists he had playing with him and hear how tight his various bands were. John Mayall's Bluebreakers were the forming ground for many blues and rock artists of the time and his influence is well acknowledged by musicians and fans alike. This is a great starting place if you want to hear his style and sound and this album tends to be less expensive that 'The Essential' collection also available. If you like this you can progress to other classic albums by the band, as well as a live album, which is an important element of the overall feel of the Bluebreakers. A great selection of tracks and some great blues music a well. Well worth a go.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,misleading,"Product Advertised is not what we received. Bought the 40oz, received a 5oz.Very disappointed as this is what you can get in the store immediately and at half the price."
1,Toilet-humor at its worst.,"This compilation proves that most comedians haven't come up with any original ideas since before the Carter presidency. Although packed full of material, the jokes never seem to stray from the age-old rants and raves reminiscent of the Seven Dirty Words era."
1,"Worthless junk from the ""Jokeman""","This album is truly awful. Filthy humor is funny but not when the jokes are 100 years old. Furthermore, this guy's delivery is horrible. He's so insecure he laughs at his own jokes and says ""It's funny!"" If that's not enough to turn you off, the album's ""artwork"" is this fat fiftysomething sleaze naked, coverned in nothing but hot dogs and donuts. This album would sell zero copies without the ""As heard on the Howard Stern show"" sticker on the package. This unfunny comedian should thank his lucky stars for Howard Stern!"
1,Dreary.,"There's not much less funny in this world than Jackie Martling. His approach to comedy is to throw out as many ""jokes"" as possible, hoping that the infitesimal few which draw a laugh will drown out the following collection of unoriginal, old, and most of all unfunny observations. Shawn Wayans recently said words to the effect that ""There's nothing sadder than a joke about something which no longer has relevance"". Martling's work on the Howard Stern show and his live act shows this to perfection. In the new world of ""shock"" comedy, someone obviously forgot to tell the ""Jokeman"" that a shock without a valid punchline just points to a sad little man who thought his class clown status would play on the big stage."
5,The history book that political Muslims all recommend,The history has never before been given such a comprehensive treatment or such a sensitive reading.Sheikh Zaloom obviously approached this work from an ideological angle and it shows.It is this particular angle that makes this book a must-read for anyone interested in the origins of today's ideological & political Islam.H
5,milwaukee tape,excellent. having the ability to read your measurements on both sides of the tape is a huge plus.
3,Shadow Dancing,"Not as good as ""The Record"" & Andy Gibb's -""Andy Gibb"". Yet, it does hold good songs of Gibb's. I wish he didn't die so soon."
2,being realistic,"I gave this cd 2 stars because,1.it was not produced by andy gibb,2.his brothers helped him write his songs,3.he got mixed up with victoria Principal,I would of loved to hear what his songs sounded like if he produced his cds,and i would have loved it if he told his brothers to leave him alone so he could write his own songs,I like andy gibb but,I think his songs could have been better if he did it his way."
4,One of the disco era's BEST.,"Most people would recognize this album for it's title track ""Shadow Dancing"" - which was incredibly popular during it's day - but, suprize, that's not even the BEST song on this album. While most disco era artists put out albums containing maybe TWO marketable songs - Andy Gibb's ""Shadow Dancing"" is about 85% excellent, unforgettable songs. Very worth the cost of the CD, and sure to beat the polyester off of ANY of the disco compilations on the market (INCLUDING the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack)."
5,This is the best book on leadership I've read in 10 years!,"John Maxwell's book on leadership lays a wonderful foundation for taking the steps necessary to go to the next level of leadership. Each of the 21 Laws are practical with enough examples and applications to ""get the point."""
2,Disappointing,I thought this book offered few insights and spent too many pages glorifying the author's leadership successes. Caveat: I have not read many leadership books and perhaps have been spoiled by great books from Jim Collins and Patrick Lencioni.
2,Irrefutable? Give me a break.,"This book should have been 21 Helpful Hints, not 21 Irrefutable Laws. Maxwell never brings his ""laws"" together into a model or tells the reader how to apply them. I have to admit, I did enjoy the book while reading it, but I felt cheated when I reached the end. The notion that his laws or anyone's laws are irrefutable is simply nonsensical."
4,What are these guys talking about? Its a good book!,"OK, I have to admit it. I am a Maxwell fan. I just like his stuff. If you had to read just one Maxwell book read this one. In it John synthesizes his lifetime of teaching and leadership into twenty-one irrefutable laws of leadership. For diehard Maxwell fans, this book is not going to tell you anything you do not already know, but it serves are a great reminder of those principles that separate successful leaders from the also-rans.To be sure, there are some who see such works on leadership as circumventing the leading and power of the Holy Spirit, but they are wrong. Good leadership cannot make up for the lack of spiritual depth, but put the two together- leadership and spiritual depth and you have an unstoppable situation."
3,Too much bulk but a lot of good sence,"The essence of the message in this book could have been caught in a book half the size. The examples given are mostly from sports. It does not go in depth enough to be much more than interesting reading. It gives a few AHAAs, but is not really a handbook. The most interesting part is the application to leadership in organisations where the followers might as well quit, as with a church. I have never before considered leadership qualities in this context and it is an interesting comparison to business leadership where, after all, most of the people are dependent on the salary they get. Despite the too strong focus on vague examples from sports, the overall concept is trustworthy and there is really nothing in the book to directly disagree with. Don't expect too much but by all means, read it."
1,All but useless,"This book is written in a weird hybrid style of sermon and ineffective lecture. Each ""Law,"" which is actually a fairly truthful insight into leadership, is a chapter. The expression of the law is followed by a tale to help clarify what he means by each law, much in the way one might expect a sermon to proceed... then follows another story, then another, then maybe several illustrations. By the time this process is all over, the reader knows exactly what the law means, but has no idea how to be the kind of leader that doesn't run afoul of it. And so it goes, chapter after chapter, all illumination and no explanation. I definitely had the feeling that the author wanted me to buy or reference another of his offerings to get the ""how to"" part, but Mr. Maxwell will not have another penny from this reader. My advice to anyone who reads this review: spend your money on something by Covey."
1,21 Laws of What?,"This book is full of nice little ancedotes and repetitious references to Maxwell's personal history at Skyline church but doesn't illuminate the reader on how to be a better leader. Mostly it's stuff like ""let's consider the Law of Magnetism... you attract people who are like you."" Wow! Great! and how do I use this Law? .... and how do I learn Magnetism?.... how does this work in leadership? ..... ""and now for a little story about Abraham Lincoln...."" So what do we learn from Mr. Maxwell's book? Not much unless you yearn for lots of nice stories about Henry Ford, Jack Welch, various NBA and NFL coaches ad naseum... oh and as the other reviewer mentioned some really dumb graphs."
3,Religious examples far too frequent,"Definately not for those who are looking for a how-to manual in managing people. Maxwell is distinctly targeting experienced leaders who are looking to become more effective, and he provides food-for-thought as opposed to practical advice. While I can appreciate Maxwell's background is derived primarily from his Christian leadership experiences, the religious overtones were far too frequent for my taste. - audio version"
4,Practical and Inspiring,I listened and re-listened to the cassette tapes and found them inspiring. I especially appreciated the emphasis on developing leaders in one's wake as the mark of a true leader.
3,Not enough meat!,"I too have heard John speak, purchased his 100 lessons on leadership (excellent), and teach some of his material to others. I was really looking forward to this book however, as one has already pointed out I found it light. I understand it must be so since there is much to cover. I think that if you have NOT had much of John's teaching this will be excellent (I purchased 30 copies for my staff team) however if you are an avid learner and leader it will not provide much in the way of meat to apply right now! at least not new meat!"
1,The 21 Laws of Politics?,"This book is very superficial, and has no practical application. It is more about being a good politician than being a good leader."
5,required reading for any manager,"Maxwell outlines not only the laws for leadership, he explains why they work. he does not only present personal theories he interviews many proven leaders for the laws he writes about. His laws of leadership are recognized and used all over the world."
2,Disappointing,"I have heard John Maxwell speak and have been overwhelmed by his insights. However, this book leaves me cold. Maxwell enumerates the qualities and illustrates them with many historical examples, but fails to spend much time in detailing how to personally apply and develop the 21 Laws."
5,Everything one ever needs to know about being a leader.,"The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership is one of Maxwell's best books, and easily his best on leadership. It is by far better than Becoming a Person of Influence and Developing the Leaders Around You. It is ideal for any leader to read, regardless of how good (or poor) your leadership abilites are. Maxwell teaches us why leadership is important and how we can develop ourselves as better leaders and those we lead to reproduce our efforts for generations to come. I have had many great leaders who empoly the lessons learned in this book, as well as many terrible ones who could learn a thing or to from Maxwell. My leadership abilities greatly improved after reading this and so will yours."
5,Fantastic Leadership Book,"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. The first time I read it, I did so on a plane trip all at once. The second time, I took it in one chapter at a time to really study it. It gives the concepts followed by historical examples as well as personal examples. I really liked the way Maxwell thinks. We need more guys like this in leadership positions in every business."
1,Great Alternative to a Sleeping Pill,"A horribly boring book.Maxwell's books are not LAWS!! They are his personal opinions and/or theories. He needs to stop trying to be the Einstein or Newton of Management & Leadership.If he wants to truly find out about leadership, he should attend a military leadership school for the full amount of time (anywhere between two weeks and a year)."
2,Very refutable,"This hugely popular leadership guru has an ego to match, telling stories about how great he is at creating new leaders and inspiring people at his conferences. And when he's not telling stories about himself, he's telling stories that have very little to do with the laws they are supposedly propping up. During the second and third listen through the tapes, I kept thinking, ""That has almost nothing to do with what he's saying.""Perhaps he deals with it in other books, but Maxwell never lets on to what leadership really is. He claims it's ""influence,"" but why not just talk about influence then? And what are the goals of leadership? By not addressing the goals of leadership, Maxwell merely feeds on the narcisicism of his readers, who long to be ""leaders"" themselves because being a leader is cool.Stick to Max De Pree's Leadership in an Art for some truly thoughtful and humble reflections from a man who really was a great leader."
3,More philosophy than how-to,Maxwell's book describes the Laws of leadership by way of describing traits that leaders possess. It offers insight into the characteristics of a leader but does little to show you how to develop these traits yourself.The audiobook was a good commute companion and the tape is filled with good anecdotes and examples (reminded me of Paul Harvey) which made it more interesting. Don't expect to walk away with any working knowledge of developing your leadership abilities though.
2,"Lots of quotable lines, but little substance.","I was prepared to really like this book, and I did, but not as a guide to learning how to be a leader. It's a collection of anecdotes designed to demonstrate each of Maxwell's laws of leadership, and it's interesting for that.But if you're looking for a book with some good advice about how to develop and refine your leadership skills, look elseshere. At no time does Maxwell provide insight as to how the skills he describes can be developed by the reader.Bottom line: An entertaining and easy read with some interesting stories about people you've heard of, along with some sound advice, but no real meat to help you grow as a leader."
5,As informative as it is inspiring,"John Maxwell's The 21 Irrefutable Laws Of Leadership: Follow Them And People Will Follow You is a superbly written guide for those seeking to influence and inspire the men and women who work and live around them. A collection of lively stories about the foibles and successes of Lee Iacocca, Abraham Lincoln, Princess Diana, and Elizabeth Dole are as enaging as they are illustrative regarding core attitudes and visions of corporate and managereial leadership. Witness the example cited of Princess Diana, who even after she was stripped of her title, was still able to lead a global effort toward banning land mines because of her sophisticated ability to influence others. As informative as it is inspiring, The 21 Irrefutable Laws Of Leadership is also available in an abridged Audio Cassette format."
2,Nothing to apply. . .,"A majority of these ""laws of leadership"" are beyond our control or ability to influence. There is no practical application to making them work for you. I also found that some of his laws seem to contradict. For example, one law talks about developing leaders around you, but in another law he explains that he took over a position and replaced an entire staff of 40 people (with the exception of two) because they were holding back the organization. So do I try to develop those around me or fire them and bring in new ones? I didn't find very much of the information helpful."
2,Disappointing product of John Maxwell,"The table of contents gave me some hope that this would be a useful and practical book on developing leadership attributes. I was hoping for sophisticated discussion from an accomplished leader-teacher. Instead I found one anecdote after another, with very little useful analysis and very few practical points to apply to my organization. I'm sure Mr. Maxwell knows more than this book reflects; I just can't find it here."
2,A lightweight overview of leadership traits,"Like many books in this genre, Maxwell provides a lightweight overview of the traits of leadership. He ""proves"" his rules with one or two examples, a method that is logically incorrect, and the only reason he gets away with it is that most of the rules are pretty obvious.What the reader won't get is much content. The frustrated reader will ask, ""OK, this is a trait of a good leader. How do I get there?"" This book does not provide an answer."
2,Good Rules Yes Good Book No in my opinion,"The rules make sense and are qualities a good leader generally has. But there is no information to help grow these qualities. Instead I am left reading chapter after chapter about how well the author displays these qualities. Honestly I don't care how good the author is, I want to know how to grow these qualities in myself."
4,Short and sweet: 21 principles of leadership,"Frequent motivational author John C. Maxwell, a former pastor, squarely based these 21 laws of leadership on enduring values. These guidelines are meant to inspire, not innovate, as they offer techniques to make leading by principle a practical reality. Maxwell's straightforward, insightful rules are well worth the time you will spend reading them. We recommend this gem of simplicity as a game book for building stronger teams and becoming a better leader."
2,Irrefutable? Laws?,"It is ridiculous to claim to present ""Irrefutable Laws"" of leadership.Maxwell presents some leadership ideas, principles, and insights based on his experience and knowledge. It would be more appropriate and honest to present them as such.Read at this level, perhaps this book can be beneficial in leadership development."
2,No enough meat just pointers on what leaders need,"I was very disappointed in the book. He is one of my favorite authors. However, I feel I was robbed when I bought this book. I would read a chapter and then say to myself ""that is it""? Great ldeas but no practical application. It would be better to purchase ""Lincoln on Leadership"" by Donald T. Phillips then this book. At least this small paper back describes how Licoln applied his leadership skills while he was President. From standing in the rain with the soliders to the words he used to unite a nation. This book was just a warm and fuzzy on why leaders need to obtain the 21 laws how I have no idea."
2,Not trash but disappointing,"The writing was decent and the stories were entertaining but I am not sure there is enough meat in here to satisfy. First, Maxwell assumes anyone with a succesful past is automatically a great leader. He uses their success to justify his Laws when the connection at times is not apparent. I don't think Mother Teresa was concerned about leadership as much as being an example of Christ and Christian living. A topic by the way this man of God did not bother to pursue when the greatest example of leadership in my opinion is Jesus. I do not want to be judgmental but will say I was disappointed that a man who teaches leadership and has been a Pastor of a number of successfull churches, did not provide ANY spirtual guidance for other church leaders and ministers of the Gospel."
2,Leadership 101 at best,"A good book for a High School student who would like to look at the very basics of leardership. If you are already in a leadership roll ,as an adult, in business, government or other organization and you need this book....you should resign you position."
1,TERRIBLE!,"Quite a disappointing book. I could not even finish it. While the author is a pastor and could have applied these to running the church in his community, leading an organization is a bit different. He does not draw upon enough examples in the real world.I am willing to give my book to anyone who wants it."
1,The worse book about leadership I ever read.,"The book explains the author's very, but very personal thoughts on why every body can become a Leader with no real factors, the ""laws"" are things that happen to him on his ways to become a leader, the guy is a priest, and no help on how this laws will help you on your career or your business, boring examples (compares princess Diana with Mother Maria Teresa de Calcuta), and no good conclusions, if there is any."
5,Not for those looking for a hand to hold,"This book is wonderful in its insightful wisdom, but it definetely not for anyone looking to be guided every step of the way. Rather this book is a broad brush stroke of the principles of leadership with many real-world examples to back each one up. Maxwell, gives just the right amount of content without dictating to the reader the a road map to success. Each principle can be further explored in depth to allow the reader to concentrate on those areas in which they are most in need of improvement. Masterfully done, by far Maxwell's best book yet."
3,"Book has promise, but lacks muscle and in-depth discussion","Maxwell gives some excellent irrefutable laws, but then fails to back up his maxims with expounding. Additionally, many of his laws are rife with examples of him patting himself on the back with how his leadership was able to accomplish something never before done. While I respect and admire his experience, and will undoubtedly use some of his ideas, I don't need to be reminded why he is the expert on the subject every twenty pages. Overall, a decent book, but certainly not one for those who are looking to jumpstart their leadership career. For more in-depth analysis, see Covey or Bennis and Nanus."
5,"Ahhh, Andy Gibb...","Firstly, I'd like to start my review with correcting some misinformation in another review here on Amazon. Andy Gibb was indeed heavily addicted to cocaine and had problems with alcohol, but he was not a heroin addict / user. Just a little FYI for the fans...As for the music, this album sounds like a more mature Andy Gibb, which is exactly what it was. ""After Dark"" is an incredibly sexy song, as is ""Desire"". ""I Can't Help It"" with Olivia Newton-John is also memorable in its harmonies and gentle tones.This is a great album for any Andy Gibb fan, Bee Gees fan, or general seventies-genre listener.And my son loves Andy Gibb...and three year olds are never wrong. ;-)"
2,Operation great; RUSTS very quickly!,"I don't know why I waited years to buy this simple solution to the dreaded job of peeling potatoes, using an archaic peeler designed in the 50s. Duh. Buy it! :)EDITED:::::: This peeler rusted out soon after purchased; I don't recommend it. It operates fabulously, but rust is not cool. :("
3,The 10th film in Universal's Sherlock Holmes series,"""Pursuit to Algiers,"" the tenth film in Universal's Sherlock Holmes series, is fairly routine overall, but it does have a novel twist in that it sends the Great Detective and Dr. Watson off to sea.In some ways, its plot is similar to the next film, ""Terror by Night,"" in that Holmes is once again renting out his services as a bodyguard of sorts, this time protecting the son of the assassinated King of Ravenia as he sails home to claim his throne. The future monarch is disguised as Watson's nephew! Aside from Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, what gives this entry its kick are the other passengers, the most eccentric and suspicious bunch ever booked onto a voyage.Coming at the tail-end of a series whose finest moments were now behind it, ""Pursuit to Algiers"" is far from the best, but possessing enough suspense and atmosphere to recommend it.Brian W. Fairbanks"
1,I was pushed to the limit watching it!!,"I know that this is not very articulate, but never before have I seen such a total unadulterated sheer load of rubbish in my life. The acting is terrible, the plot is worse, its one to get up in the middle of and make a cup of tea!!"
4,"Good start, but lacking.","I love PVP, let me say that right now.I realize it's earlier work than the other books, but it has a strange structure that Kurtz is not used to which makes for an awkward read at times. It's not bad, just not his strength. Some the stories seem a little flat at times.That said, it's still funny as all get out, but it's probably not the best introduction to the PVP staff."
3,Good,I don't think it's the best book by this author but it does give you an insight into a lot of the major courses in Ireland.
3,An Affordable collection,"This is a 10-Song collection by Rosanne Cash; best of all, They are ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. I'll be honest and say I'm not a big fan of Rosanne Cash, although when she first came on the scene, her voice was quite unique (Much like an unpolished, early Rondstadt). Many of her songs, like those of Emmy Lou Harris', are simply cover songs, and fortunately for Rosanne, she has a ""big-name"" father with a large catalog of material to choose from, including: ""Tennessee Flat Top Box"", and ""That's How I Got to Memphis"", both which are included here. Also included here, are her poor cover of the Amazing Rhythm Ace's ""Third Rate Romance"", and Elvis' ""Big River"". Still ""Seven Year Ache"" and ""Blue Moon With A Heartache"" are here, making this more than a Fair album. For the price, this is probably the most affordable Rosanne Cash collection out there; and if you're a Rosanne fan, you could do worse. C+"
5,Don Reno At His Best,"This CD has some of Don Reno's classic numbers. As a banjo player who aspires to play as well as Don Reno, I was glad to get this CD. It is all instrumental and wonderful bluegrass music. Highly recommended."
5,Skank-a-liscious,"Dr. John understands every note he plays and sings, backing up expert vocals and musicianship with brilliant scholarship. This is solid Grammy material, from the moody title track, to the backtalking babes on You Swore, to the heartfelt soul of Georgeanna, to the hyperkinetic Lightenin. I keep it in the car, crank up the CD player to 10, and cruise along in a stone funky groove."
4,Classic Dr. John,"I was attracted to this title by the Amazon review that called it the best blues CD of the year. I've been listening to Dr. John for what? 30 years? Maybe more... I'd never really thought of him as a blues artist, per se, but obviously, he's comfortable within that idiom. I have always considered him as a combination of many influences, including jazz, blues, rock, R&B and all things Cajun. It's the way he amalgamates these influences yet keeps his own distinct personality that has kept me a fan. This disc does not disappoint. Many songs on it are readily recognizable as being Dr. John, but I think we are witnessing a maturing of his sound. The band is excellent, as is the recording quality. Makes me feel like breaking into the chorus of ""Iko, Iko""."
4,Prime New Orleans Music and then some,"This well-crafted, wide-ranging set of 14 tracks clocks in just under one hour and eight minutes. Mac (Dr. John) Rebennack wrote or co-wrote all the songs, including four co-authored with Doc Pomus. Funk and second line rhythms are essential to the CD but, rather than being in front of the mix as in Dr. John's 'Gumbo' and 'In The Right Place' releases, they contribute to the groove that pulls together the music's other influences. The varied additions to 'Creole Moon' include sax (David 'Fathead' Newman), Cajun fiddle (Michael Doucet), slide guitar, flute as well as Afro-Cuban and Latin percussion. You can listen to this release casually or listen more deeply for the intertwined grooves and cross rhythms. 'Georgianna' is a Cajun ballad; ""Litenin'"" is Latin dance. If you get a chance, see Dr. John and the Lower 9-11 at one of their couple of hundred shows a year; they are extremely worth catching in person."
2,Bland and flat flavor,"Flavor was bland and one dimensional. I was really hoping for a complex, interesting malt vinegar. I could have gotten better at my local grocery store."
3,"Not Bad, but No Classics","First, let's get this out of the way...it is great to have Donald Duck, Uncle Scrooge, and the other classic characters available again. The three stories in this book are all of European extraction, and they do not have the same zip that the classic American stories of Carl Barks or the new works by Don Rosa or William Van Horn do. For those, you'll have to get the comic books. The goal with this series is to expand Disney stories to a wider audience. With luck, that goal will succeed."
4,Very involving and with sound logic to support conclusions,"This book takes economics out of abstract textbook equations and applies it to government, culture,etc.The book makes good use of statistics,for things like concentration of wealth among different income levels and the average wage increases through the years of all kinds of education levels.It is explained why cultural differences can make one country more competitive in one area than another, and other ways in which culture impacts economics and vice versa.For example, Indians are credited with drawing corporations with their close family ties:there's usually someone to watch over the kids while Mommy or Daddy takes another shift, and there's no day-care expenses or parents taking time off to be with a sick child. Finally,it's not too technical and it's a whole lot more interesting than some economic material I've digested."
4,Still relevant a dozen years later,"The central thesis of this book is that those who own capital, or who can control its allocation, are in a much better economic position than those who have to work for a living. Writing this book during the Clinton years, the authors were speaking with respect to the USA. It is now 13 years later, and their thesis still holds, except it is applicable to the entire world. The financial meltdowns across Asia and Latin America at the turn of the century, followed by crises in the USA and parts of the Middle East more recently have all underscored the power of capital over labor. Now, throughout the world, central banks and by extension, commercial banks, run the economies of nations, states and cities. My only complaint about this book is its minimal reference to the works of Karl Marx and Lenin, two individuals who foresaw much of what has happened after WWII."
3,An interesting SF mystery book,"A murder / kidnapping mystery set in a future universe with a deadly biological organism as the weapon. Most of the book focuses on Shroud - a retired Doctor who has lived out his allotted time, Apple - his young lover, and Bart Reve - a bullish P.I. All three get caught up in the investigation, cover-up, and kidnapping attempts. The story is fast paced, and relied on character development, with only minor references to the future world they live in. A good light read."
4,Just David,"I've loved David Bowie from the moment he appeared on the pop culture scene. This CD is typical of his earlier works and while some of the tracks are ""strange"", they're ""David Bowie Strange"" and I like the whole CD. I have to say in my defense that I do appreciate his earlier works more than the later ones. Maybe it's because his earlier work reminds me of my youth and I relate to it better. David constantly re-invents himself and I've seen him in concert twice - once in a casual setting and once in all his ""show"" glory. Both were enjoyable, unforgettable and I'd go to either one again in a heartbeat.It's hard for me to say anything negative about The Deram Anthology because I am such a big fan, so I'll just say if you're a Bowie fan, you enjoy listening to all his music if for nothing other than to try and dissect it and make sense of it, you will enjoy this CD."
1,Road to Nowhere,"This book contains very little on Pres. McKinley or Pres. Roosevelt, but focuses more on the life and trial of Leon Czolgosz, McKinley's assassin. This might be interesting if there was a story to it. There isn't. Why did Czolgosz kill the President? He was doing his duty, to quote Czolgosz. Wow! That is exciting reading! The majority of this book is psyco-babble trying to understand why a person would kiil the president, or how or why American society changed to create anarchists.There is nothing to analyze here. the heart of man is wicked and these things have and will continue to happen because mankind is fallen and we live in a fallen world.From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? (James 4:1 KJV)"
5,thoughtful and compelling,"Amazing, here is a book with no disfunctional personalities, noevil, manipulative people, no extraordinary violence or disasters;only everyday people who are dealing with a difficult life situation with honesty and hope and courage. Boring? Not a bit. Thoughtful and compelling, holds your interest? Absolutely. Jim Kaldy, the narrator of this story, is your not so average man with a wonderfully healthy perspective of his own childhood, and a courageous perspective towards his ailing daughter's childhood. Worthy of Oprah's book group. We loved it in ours."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air...,"...is the best way to describe this five song ep. ""Get In I'll Drive"" and ""Midwestern Son"" are songs worthy of heavy rotation radio airplay. Andrea writes pop songs with the lyrical wit and melodic splendor of such contemporary artists as David Gray, Shawn Mullins, Amy Corriera, Juliana Hatfield, and Tracy Bonham, to name a few. The recording is spirited and gives the impression that she's as good in concert and she is in the studio, ....looking forward to a full length release...though this is a nice little pop gem to add to your collection, especially for those who appreciates the heyday of 1970s singer songwriters."
1,lucky it was free,I like pauly d but that was kind of stupid didn't show anything about what he would be doing in the show.
5,Yeah Buddy!,"Pauly D project was awesome! Plenty of laughs with everyone's favorite ""guido"". FTD Pauly is always high energy & highly entertaining! Definitely worth watching! Yeah Pauly D project yeah!"
2,Poor attempt,"The story was good, but theree where too many unbelievable elements. It was surprising to see such poor work from such good actors."
3,"Could've been better, could've been worse.","OK, this movie sort of let me down. But, since I love a good action-comedy movie, this film kept my attention.STORYLINE-Not bad. It wasn't a very complicated plot at all, but was interesting enough to make you care.ACTING-Well, the actors should've switched rolls. Chris Rock was way over his head with the main dramatic role, which he ALMOST handles alright. Meanwhile, Anthony Hopkins has nothing to do as the straight-man.OVERALL-3/5 Like I said, could've been better, but could've been MUCH worse. It's no ""Showtime"" or ""Bourne Identity,"" but it does what an action-comedy should do. No more, no less."
2,one liners from hell,"I SAW BAD COMPANY AT A SNEAK PREVIEW. BOY DO I FEEL SORRY FOR ALL THE MANY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE. O.K. THE MOVIE ISN'T TERRIBLE. IF YOU LAUGHT AT THE TRAILER, YOU MIGHT LAUGH A LIL' MORE DURING THE MOVIE, BUT NOT MUCH. THERE ARE A FEW FUNNY MOMENTS, BUT THE DIALOGUE IS MADE UP OF ABOUT 1000 ONE LINERS. ALOT OF GOOD ACTION SCENES WASTED ON ALOT OF LAME EVENTS THAT COULD NEVER TAKE PLACE IN THE TIME FRAME GIVIN'. BOTTOM LINE IS, MOVIES THAT TRY TO SURVIVE OFF OF 1 ONE LINER LEADING UP TO ANOTHER NEED TO RETHINK THEMSELVES. HOPKINS AND ROCK DO WELL WITH WHAT THEY WERE GIVIN'. LET'S HOPE THERE'S NOT A SEQUEL IN THE WORKS. ONE LAST THING, I SAW THIS FILM WITH 5 OTHER PEOPLE. 1/5 PEOPLE LOVED THIS MOVIE."
1,BAD MOVIE,"One star is the lowest rating I am allowed to use, otherwise merits ZERO STARS.Ought to be funny, but it's not. If you saw the trailer, then you also saw all the good parts of this movie. I didn't get involved with this movie at all and even the action and chase scenes didn't engage me very much."
2,Mr. Rock two times in the same movie!,"Silly and predictable thriller without any trace of originality. Chris Rock, a most overreacting actor, plays a double part, Kevin Pope and Michael Turner, the first one a vagabond and the latter an inteligent and cold secret agent from the CIA. But they are twin brothers! (what a great idea!)and Mr. Turner (the agent) is killed in action and Mr. Pope must replace him for the sucess of the mission.With that premise, the movie goes on only based upon the abominable jokes and gags of Rock and some unimpressive action scenes and car chases. A waste of time for a competent actor as Anthony Hopkins. And for you too."
4,Bad Company,"I really liked this movie even though most reviews I've read give this movie an average rating, it deserves an above average rating. Chris Rock isn't as raw in his comedy as he is today however, it is a Disney made movie because Touchstone is owned by Disney so anytime you see Touchstone the movie will more than likely be more conservative. The movie was really entertaining especially being a huge fan of Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock. Who would think to put the combination of stars (Anthony and Chris) together and have it work so well together. Plus both of the actors were believable. It's definitly worth watching and I'm going to buy this one on DVD."
3,Doesn't Quite Live up to Expectations!!!!,"I have to admit, judging by the trailer and commercials, I walked into theis movie with pretty high hopes. The pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock seemed perfect! (Fan of both!) Unfortunatley, from the minute the movie started, I could tell I was'nt going to get what I had been hoping for. Kind of stuck in between being a serious action flick and a comedy, Bad Company is really a hit or miss thing. I laughed a few times, but the movie never seemed to really hit it's potential. Overall Opinion: Wait for the video release!"
1,It BURNNNNS!,"AUGHHH! Oh, avoid! I actually thought this could be funny. Chris Rock didn't write his lines and it's never funny. There seems to be a lack of interest on all parts. Main actors, director, etc. etc. The humor all comes from him being a black James Bond. Spare us. It fails on almost every level, it's dry and dull, I thought it would never end!"
1,One of the year's worst mainstream movies! Save your [money],"This latest movie from the people who gave the world such movies as ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", ""Con Air"" and Armeggedon. I'm talkig about Jerry Bruckheimer here. Add to the mix the director of ""Batman Forever"",""Batman & Robin"", well you get the idea. This movie is basically a ""popcorn movie"", in other words check your brain out at the door. ...The movie is very formalic and is typical of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. I would say more but I do not want to spoil it for you.Save your hard earned [money] for something better than this movie ! if you must see it, wait until it gets to a second run movie theater. Or better yet wait for it on DVD!"
2,"Bang, bam, boom, DUD...","If you're a fan of lazily constructed action flicks then this is your man. Sadly, talent like Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock are wasted on a script that lathers on clichés and plot holes (nonsensical is an understatement) with rusty dialog, little laughs (why is Chris Rock in this movie if he's not allowed to be funny) and regurgitated familiarity. Sure, there are some thrills, but they are far too expected and they only get you once, then you're over it. Hopkins does the best he can here, and his presence certainly gives the film a much needed facelift, but at the end of the day this is a forgettable ride. It's not offensively `bad', it's just irritatingly `bland'. There isn't much use for this when equally brainless espionage fare like `I Spy' (same year, mind you) at least understands the need for humor to elevate a film that is, without that humor, devastatingly dry.This film will leave you parched."
5,When the Singing Stops,"I love Di Morrissey as an author. She didn't disappoint with her latest novel When the Singing Stops. The characters in the story were strong and sometimes confronting. Di's descriptions of the countryside made it simple to visualise. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. I sat in my favourite chair, with a rug, a cup of hot cocoa and just read and enjoyed. Fabulous. Thanks Di!"
5,Need more.,"I have only read ""Tears of The Moon"" and thoroughly enjoyed it (5+ stars). I am interested in reading more of Di Morrissey's novels, however, they are difficult to find. I would like to get hard bound in any of her works. I will consider used. Please respond."
3,Item description and photo is not accurate,"Either the item description and product photograph are inaccurate, or we were shipped the wrong kind of Lavazza coffee. The item describes and shows standard Lavazza drip coffee, but what was delivered to us was Lavazza ""Premium House Blend"" which is very different. We prefer the standard ""Premium Drip"" type shown in the description above."
1,Not what it used to be,"I used to buy this coffee a lot a few years ago and it was hands down the BEST coffee I had ever had. Recently though I bought a can and the taste was god awful. Like some other reviewers said, sour is the best word. I thought I had gotten a bad can so I tried it one last time and again I got a can of sour, disgusting coffee. They must have changed their blend. I have been reading lately that coffee producers are now mixing lesser quality Robusta beans into their blends as a cost cutting measure. I think it must be true because I have found that in the last two years all of the brands I used to love have a completely different taste than they once did. Another one is the Allegro brand. None of their blends are what they used to be. The Allegro Breakfast blend used to be fantastic. Now it is just gross. I haven't had a decent cup of coffee in a good two years now. Do they think people won't notice? I've noticed!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Lavazza coffee. I look forward to it's distinct aroma and delicious flavor. This coffee, however, has a weak flavor, nothing like the rest of the Lavazza's delicious product line."
5,The Ultimate Dutchman,"Sinopoli's rendition of Wagner's first successful opera, Der Fliegende Hollander, is something that (almost) everyone should own. The orchestral feeling of the stormy sea is both enchanting and furious at the same time. Cheryl Studer is magnificient when singing Senta's Ballad, and Placido Domingo does what he does best as Erik. The choir and the orchestra are in top form and the fast tempi Sinopoli chooses is well done and exhilarating.I don't know about the other two reviewers that gave this CD one and two stars out of five, but this Hollander is here to stay. And stay away from James Levine's rendition; it's so slow that you'll fall asleep right after the Overture."
5,best Senta on disc!,"This is a wonderful record which i enjoy more and more. The conductor and the singers are all first rate. But especially Cheryl Studer sings the most beautiful of all Senta's on disc. She really sounds girlish and fresh, no problems for the voice at this date of recording! The most other Sentas on record sound also beautiful but not young enough. The Technics are also without fault however at Deutsche Grammophon. My recommendation!"
2,What's all the fuss about?,"Really, I fail to see what the fuss is about regarding this recording of Dutchman. Studer has such a flutter in her voice especially when she really has to sing, and that's many times! She is no match for Voigt and even Behrens. Weikl fails to meet Morris in terms of vocal intensity and insight, although he is a wonderful singer. Domingo.....no comment - prefer Heppner! Sinopoli is the opera's saving grace as far as tempi and orchestra control. Chorus is great!"
1,Are you sure we can't give -3 stars?,"The only reason I can see for anyone to listen to, let alone own, this vastly inferior performance of ""Dutchman"" is the fact that the best digital stereo version seems to be unavailable. That was the incredible 1981 (or '82) live performance featuring Lisbeth Balslev (who was far better than Studer), Robert Schunk (who could outsing Domingo on his best day), Matti Salminen as Daland, and Simon Estes as the Dutchman. Yes, Estes took most of his opening monologue to warm up, but once he did he was magnificent, with the power of a Schorr and the ringing resonance of Lawrence Tibbett. And Woldeman Nelsson's conducting was nothing short of spectacular. In fact, I have this performance 2 ways, on CD and video, and I love them both.Sinopoli - spare me."
1,A rather paternalistic viewpoint,"I have mixed emotions about this book. It does include interesting information, but- at least in the section about the Hopi and other Pueblo people- it acts as though they are a dead culture. Everything is in the past tense. Furthermore, the author described ceremonies which should NOT be discussed in a book intended for children. Especially inappropriate was their discussion of the katsinvaki, which is an initiation ceremony for children. What? Do they think Hopi kids cannot read??? I suggest that the author read the book ""Appropriated Pasts"" by McNiven & Russell. It is in interesting consideration of how anthropology has been used by dominant cultures. It's too bad. This book has some good points, but I would certainly not carry it in our shop, which is in northeastern Arizona (Hopi country)!"
5,Nikon DK-21 Rubber Eyecup,"OEM Eyecup for Nikon D80, just like the one that came with the camera out of the box. Perfect fit!!"
5,Nikon D80 Rubber Eyecup,Item was received before the expected delivery date. In new condition. I would not hesitate to purchase from this vendor again
4,Good Eyecup But It Falls Off,"This is a Nikon product D80 owners shouldn't need to replace but inevitably they will. After the first few times it fell off my camera and I put it back on I intentionally wiggled it around in order to get an idea of why it would fall off and what I could do to prevent this happening. I never did figure it out, and finally it fell off on a forest hike and that was that. Luckily these are unbelievably cheap (for Nikon), so buying 3 and keeping them in the camera bag is not that big a deal."
1,Does not fit Nikon D40!!!,"Little upset that I ordered this for my D40, and it doesn't fit my D40 as advertised. The bottom of my view finder is covered with the eyecup frame because it doesn't slide all of the way down.If it fit, I think it would be great."
2,Not for the D5000,I bought this intending to use it for my Nikon D5000. Let's just say it kind of fits but it's like putting an XL tshirt on a 5 year old kid. Lesson learned...
5,Exactly As Advertised,"My original eyepiece popped off so this is it's replacement. Amazon has just about everything and because this was OEM, everything was exactly as expected."
4,As advertized,"Nice eyecup as advertized but somehow I ordered this on for my Nikon D5000, which it does not fit.Don't know if it was my mistake or mislead on the description page."
3,I have mixed feelings.,I bought this expecting to find it fitting my D40x Nicon Camera perfectly. It fits but it is not what belongs there. I will eventually replace it with the correct item. Perhaps I read wrong but I was of the understanding that it was right for my camera.
3,This does what it is meant to do.,It is what is...and it is what it should be. It does what it says and it does what it should.
4,Lost my eyecup!,"I realized after a trip that the eyecup was missing on my camera! It didn't affect the camera's performance, but wasn't as comfortable to take pictures. Definitely worth replacing."
1,Very Disappointing,"My two year old twins are really into tops right now, so I thought they would love this. After pumping the top to full capacity and letting it stand on it's own, the train will spin VERY slowly around the track only 1 and 1/2 turns before it stops and the sound effects keep going while nothing moves. If you want to watch the entire top spin, you must hold it up off the ground by the top of the pumper. My kids are very frustrated that it does not work like a traditional top. If the train would spin faster and longer, they might be able to play with it. Maybe the one I got is broken? It came with no instructions, which a top should not need, and all of the writing on the box is in German. Since my kids who love tops want nothing to do with it, I can only give it one star."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this toy for my 3.5 yo twins for over $20, which for a top is very very expensive. But the majority of the reviews were positive, and the kids are really into trains, so I bought it. It arrived promptly, and the kids immediately started playing. About 10 minutes into the game the sound stopped working. The train does go around the field, but very slowly, and stops about 5 seconds into the trip. To push the handle down takes all of their strength, so I don't think a younger child would be able to push it down. It does not come close to my expectations for the price. Would NOT recommend."
4,Grandson loves it,My grandson (9 months old) loves the toy train. It not only spins but also makes real train sounds. I would recommend this toy. I'm not sure how durable it would be for an older child though. He is too young to make it spin himself but he loves watching and listening to it.
2,disappointed,It looked like the base was a suction cup...my son used to have one and was abler to play with it on his play table---this doesn't even spin well....a real dissapointment as I actually sought this item out after much searching and was so excited for my grandson to enjoy it as his Dad did!
2,Not very stimulating,"This toy top is not at all what I expected. Not very stimulating to look at. The top must be pressed down very hard to get the train noise to play and then the train moves around the track rather slow and even stops before the train sund is over and the top is still spinning. If the train isnt in motion you cant even tell the top is spinning as it remains silent and there isnt any color effect to notice that its spinning. The only time you are aware it spinning is when the train moves, and that is for a very short time. The worse thing about it is that it takes alot to get the train sound effect to play. The average child would not know that they must realy press it down super hard and fast to get it to play. It isnt a very stimulating toy and I my son lost interest in it after to times....just wasnt very exciting like his last spinning top he had."
5,Train Sound Top,"I have a Grandson (Almost two years old) who is in love with anything to do with trains. When he got this for Christmas, he was totally crazy about the little train going around inside the plastic cover on the top that protects the train from any damage. The little crossing gates go down as the train (Only about 1/2 inch high) goes around and arrives at the station and go up automatically as the train continues. The vertical pumping action to spin the top starts the train. The sound also is very real and there are several sounds like a whistle, bells and the clicking of railroad tracks. Very nice and rugged. I highly endorse this toy for toddlers up to maybe 5 year old kids."
4,entertaining,"I originally saw this toy from Land of Nod and fell inlove with it but was always seem too pricey for me until I found it in Amazon for a great price! My 2-year old loves playing with it, it's the first toy he grabs every morning when he gets up and around. The train definitely doesn't go fast as everyone thinks it should; the sound it makes is alright in a good way to where it's not loud enough to be annoying. It looks kind of cheap and easy to break but my 2-year old still finds it entertaining. Overall I am satisfied that I didn't spend more than what I could've spent getting it from Land of Nod, hopefully my 8-month old gets to play with it as well before his little brother breaks it."
5,"Entertaining, well-made, excellent sound and visual quality","This toy delighted both my 11 month old grandson and 15 month old grandson - much to my surprise as I bought it a bit ahead of when I thought they would use it. It is stable, very colorful, and both boys sought it out to play with, even though they needed some help with working it. Delightful!"
1,Cheaply made,"The cone base broke in just 3 months use. The base is a very thin plastic, needs to be upgraded. Do not purchase if you want a toy that lasts."
5,Toddler Pleaser,My daughter is almost 2 and she is fascinated by this top..It keeps her busy for quite a while. Its also very sturdy. I'm really glad I got her this classic toy.
1,cheap,"I would not pay twenty-some dollars for this again. It's just not that impressive a toy. A little kid can't even play with it by him/herself. It doesn't seem to be made very well, either."
5,"""Two Ears Up!""","Andy Gibb died before I got a chance to tell him I'm one of his biggest fans. I'm black and I have owned Flowing Rivers and Shadow Dancing. I will be ordering them again very soon. Andy was a great songwriter - his songs touched the facet of what he yearned for in life: understanding. My favorite album is Shadow Dancing and the single ""Everlasting Love"" from that album is my favorite song. I listen to a variety of music, but will ALWAYS be a fan of Andy Gibb. -T. Gray"
5,Andy Gibb forever,"This is the first album (1977) by Andy Gibb and the best of the 3 albuns launched during its short career. The others two (1978 - Shadow Dancing and 1980 - After Dark) they are very good also, but this if detaches for musics: I JUST WANT TO BE YOUR EVERYTHING - (LOVE IS) THICKER THAN WATER - FLOWING RIVERS and WORDS AND MUSIC. It is a penalty that was discontinued by the recorder and today he is so expensive to obtain an album of this or other by ANDY GIBB."
3,Standard Holmes mystery,"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce made their final big screen appearances as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in ""Dressed to Kill,"" the twelfth film in Universal's series, and the fourteenth time the two actors brought Arthur Conan Doyle's heroes to vivid life on film.Even 35 years before Brian DePalma's thriller of the same name, the title wasn't original, having been previously used for one of Lloyd Nolan's Michael Shayne private detective thrillers. There isn't much original about this entry, but even if it's a fairly standard series episode, it still has the always superb Rathbone and Bruce to recommend it, as well as a satisfying mystery for the two to unravel.Although Rathbone left the series after this film and moved on to Broadway where he won a Tony Award, he didn't succeed in escaping Holmes, and would wear the deerstalker again on stage and in an unsold pilot for a TV series. He remains the definitive Sherlock Holmes.Brian W. Fairbanks"
4,magnetic...ismianly....,well certainly a pair of remarks well written although others have done it well also 3stooges tops them on eyelids gags and agathas aproach to superiotiousness aparant on languages ...shdfh...
2,Sad ending to series,"""Dressed to Kill"" was the last of the Sherlock Holmes series for Universal. Sad to say, it's also the most lack-lustre and boring. Despite a terrific cast--Patricia Morrison, in particular, as the slinky villainess--the story plods along so slowly, with zero suspense, that you wonder how this quickie passed the approval of Universal executives. The plot revolves around music boxes but the plot has nothing to do with the title. On the cover of my budget Sherlock Holmes double-feature for $5.95, you see a great poster of Patricia Morrison, clad in furs and silks, with a gun ready to fire. And you get the impression that the movie has something to do with a sharply attired gun moll. I'm glad I only paid $5.95 for this episode in the usually entertaining HOlmes series. Oh, by the way, the second feature on my disc is ""Terror in the Night,"" another boring episode that has absolutely nothing to do with the title."
2,Cheap thrills,"Of the fourteen Sherlock Holmes mysteries starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, three are in the ""public domain,"" meaning the copyrights have elapsed. As a result, numerous distributors offer varying-quality copies of SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPON (1942), THE WOMAN IN GREEN (1945), and DRESSED TO KILL (1946). This Digiview edition of DRESSED TO KILL, the final entry in the Rathbone-Bruce series, is typical of the public domain lot: the picture quality is fair but watchable, with a few transitional fades missing (TV print?) and a replaced ""End"" title. Nevertheless, it's always a pleasure to watch Rathbone and Bruce in action, even if DRESSED TO KILL is a second-echelon Holmes effort.Serious collectors will want to get MPI Home Video's beautiful restorations of the entire Rathbone-Bruce series. However, for casual viewers who can't resist an impulse buy (I got it for $1 at Wal-Mart), this Digiview cheapie is okay for the price."
3,Healthy but awful taste,"I bought this oil because it was the cheapest Omega 3-6-9 supplement. However, the taste is beyond awful. I can't even finish the bottle. I can usually just man up and down it, but this is too much."
4,Exercise the Body and the Spirit,"I bought this video because it was less about ""how to be an athlete"" than a way to make cycling relaxing and pleasant. After I tried using the video, I discovered the music and scenery did take away the drudgery and help me keep cycling a lot longer than usual. This was a unique experience for me. I got the instruction I needed to get the most out of my workout but never felt pressured to perform beyond what I was comfortable with. Overall I would say that this exercise video really encourages you to combine body and spirit."
2,Cycling Not,"If you want scenery tape is very good. If you want to ride a stationary bike and watch it, good luck. Video was recorded from a car. If you assume you are riding bicycle you would want to bail out as often you run out of road on the right when the vehicle gets too close to the guard rails or moves the camera for scenery only."
4,Glad I watched this before I went on my trip!,"The quality of the video was great, and the visuals are beautiful.. The great thing is that most videos only hit one city, while this one hits three of the major cities. I really enjoyed the piece on Florence, there were a lot of interesting tid-bits and side stories in there. Good stuff to know before you go...When are you making part two?"
5,Loved it,This was a big help to me planning my trip to Italy. The hosts are very knowledgeable and personable. Gave me a lot of helpful info and beautiful pictures. Great!
4,She Left Me Hanging,"Although I enjoyed Elizabeth Kadetsky's writing on her lifelong interest in yoga and her family history, I was disappointed that the entire book was like her journal entries, her musings, and by the end of the book she had reconciled nothing about the contradictions between the practice of yoga, the people who teach it, the horrific way it is taught and the ambivalence of the Indian people toward their homegrown discipline. Nor did she come to terms with her own life and her religion, both of which it seems will continually mar her practice until she finds closure."
3,Interesting book but no index,"A book like this, a collection of anecdotes and experiences would be well served by an index. The author writes well and has many insights some of them harsh but most quite reasonable - still given the esoteric nature of the book - a glossary or index would have been very helpful."
4,Great book,"Heard about this book through reddit, and decided to use it for my yoga teacher training. It was very useful in introducing the history of yoga!"
5,Living in the Light (and small),"Some folks are into technical, some are into pricey. The size of this camera is nicey. When you're on vacation it won't make you feel like a pack mule and when you return home you'll have some great pictures to look at too! I highly recommend this camera."
1,Mine Broke!,"After 18 months of treating this camera like gold and being reasonably satisfied with the quality of the images (as long as they weren't enlarged), one day it just stopped working with the lens partially extended, frozen in place. All the repair shops want $100 to fix it. For $100 I could buy a new one. It was cute while it lasted, but I've bought a Yashica T4 (the original - not the awful zoom remake with the same name) instead. It's not nearly as small, but this elph is just too fragile."
5,Another Aspect of the Deprivations of War,"I came across this little book by accident, and although I'm neither a Civil War buff nor a food historian, I had an hour's worth of fascinating reading. The author quotes extensively from primary sources (with footnotes) to give a vivid description of what the prisoners ate -- or didn't eat. Rats and lice were delicacies to be fought over, and starvation and scurvy whittled away at the men's humanity. There are several recipes of the period to give the reader an idea of the delicious home-cooked meals the boys dreamed and talked about obsessively. The heartfelt letters to home are especially moving."
3,Booklet w/ filler not book,"The description discloses that this booklet is only 37 pages long but not that the number of pages actually addressing the title topic is only 20 - the rest being filler including 7 pages of recipes for cakes, cookies, etc of the 1800's that apparently the prisoners would have liked to have received and 5 pages of endnotes. But it has enough interesting information that I gave it 3 stars. It's the kind of booklet I would have purchased at a museum if the proceeds went to the museum."
5,Awesome Album!,"I must say, Dusty can do absolutely, and I mean anything. Dusty's version of 'Ain't No Sunshine' is outstanding. Sounds very Beatles-ish, and kind of a surf-in song. I also love her covers of Dionne Warwick's 'This Girl's in Love with You' and 'Another Night'. It, in my opinion, is much better. She brings more emotion to it, as does everything she sings. Many don't know this, but Dusty was the first to sing 'I Think It's Gonna Rain Today,' way before Bette Midler did it in the 1980s film, ""Beaches."" And 'Love Power,' plus the bonus tracks. A recommendation for all Dusty fans."
5,Randy Newman cover -,An eye opening interpretation. Excellent CD - bought it also to hear her version of Spooky - very tasty interpretation!
5,Pretty good!,"Well I haven't seen this video yet but I just read that if I write a review for this video I can win 50 bucks. That's it. It's probably good, especially if the setlist is punk hardcore and not the late metal crap."
5,Lovely Picture Book,"This is a lovely picture book representing a strong bond between a grandmother and her granddaughter. There are sweet little surprises found in the pictures...every time I read the book to my daughter we find something new. It is an easy read for a young child, simple text with warm pictures."
1,Not for T20 series ThinkPad,The description on this battery is incorrect. It will not work with a T20 series ThinkPad computer. It if for a T40 series I believe. The picture is correct. The description of the battery isn't.
5,Works great,Got this right on time and it works great. Love that it is so long. Makes it much easier to watch movies etc.
4,basic cable,"it is a cable.. and a long one, was having some coloring problems narrowed it down to a cable and this fixed the problem note i was already using a long cable so needed the length due to the monitor placement. only con is most monitor cables like this have a Phillips head on the end of the screw to tighten easier and faster in small areas where it is hard to get a hand in, was sad this did not but some long needle nose pliers made it possible, likely not an issue for you if it is just a monitor on a desk and not a enclosure"
4,Hercules,Great movie. Excellent special effects and great actors. Gives a great story to the Hercules legend.
3,Mighty but not heroic,"Lots of special effects and action. Superlative actors such as Timothy Dalton in supporting roles and Paul Tefler certainly looks the part. The main problem that I had with the series was that although it is a sympathetic potrayal of the demi god and in many instances followed the mythological tales, the hero is not - heroic. While many people decry the sword and sandal Italian epics the first two Reeves films were excellent and, in my opinion the first had some superb heroic moments. There is nothing in this series to equal the shot of Hercules standing on a hill flanked by Castor and Polux or in the temple renouncing his immortality while the rain falls. Reeves was a hero, Tefler is a well built everyman. An enjoyable film but not inspiring, worth watching but could have been better."
3,Too much editing for an otherwise great movie,"I actually saw part of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel and thought it was a very unique re-interpretation of the Greek myth. The casting and acting, while not first class, were overall very well done and I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it tremendously and wanted to own the DVD. However, I do not understand they decide to issue an abridged version on the DVD, cutting out numerous scenes that are integral part of the story. Otherwise, I would give this a 5 stars. Try to catch the un-abridged series if you can on cable. The DVD does not do the movie/script/interpretation justice."
1,unaccurate description,I only purchased this movie because it was described as having subtitles in Spanish. The description resulted to be unaccurate.
3,Hercules,"This is a good movie, however, I thought I was purchasing the uncut version, as shown in 2 parts on TV. I noticed quite a few scenes were missing from this version. How do I get the uncut version?"
4,Not Bad,"The acting is a bit rough to be sure (the younger Hercules, especially), but the effects are surprisingly good, and you grow to have real emotions for the characters. Fans of ""The Golden Bough"" will appreciate the Harvest King details, and the tensions between Patriarchy and Matriarchy are intriguing."
2,Don't buy this,"The other reviewers have covered very well the clunkiness and obvious bad editing involved in this production, so need to reiterate those things. It's visually very rough...it reminded me of old ""historical"" movies I saw in the sixties as a child. Leelee Sobieski, lightly clad or unclad in a classical nymph-bathing-in-woodland-lake scene, is the sole redeeming factor I discerned, and she sounds as if she knows full well how stupid the script is.I rented this thing after a day of Christmas shopping and was intent on a couple of hours of escapism and mind candy, and I wouldn't have caviled about a few deviations from the canon version of ths Hercules story, or about a great many. Even in that very uncritical mode, though, I couldn't watch this all the way through because it is so boring."
1,Crap.,"This purchase was a complete waste of money. I used this one time and will never again. It dries up so fast and gets really sticky which is very uncomfortable. Adding more just makes it worse. I was excited to try this product after reading reviews on it, but my husband agrees...it sucks"
4,Love the Watch!,"I bought this watch because I was looking for something simple but stylish, that could be either dressed up or down. I think the style is classic!"
5,"A Beautiful set, well documented and thorough. Shabazz!!!!!!","These guys were without question the Cream of the crop. Pure musicians, each of the highest caliber on his instrument. A ground breaking power trio that influenced and inspired bands the world over. This box set has captured their finest moments with many unrealesed titles and tracks, rare recordings and history in the making. The liner notes, which is a huge booklet provides wonderful information and facts on the bands history and individual members. The psychedelic cover and discs are simply a killer also. Cream covered everything from Blues and Rock to Psych and orchestrated pop tunes and ballads. Simply put, one of the top five bands to emerge from the 60's rave up musical revolution. A must own for all music fans and collectors. No collection would be complete without this classic killer."
4,Everything by Cream,"An excellent complilation, particularly in terms of the split between studio and live CDs. My only complaint is with the mix on disc 3 for White Room and Politician which appears inferior to the original vinyl. My opinion - any disagreement?"
3,Feels like 24 hours to finish watching,"I still can't picture Mickey Rooney as a screen bad guy. Yet he is the heavy, a gold smuggler begging the airline crew to rescue him from the gang he's involved with. They capture and torture him, he escapes once more to be bumped off in the return flight. It's difficult to find any virtue to root for where evil dominates both sides of the drama. Lex Barker is wooden as the pilot, supposedly our good guy, but what good does he really do anyway?"
4,Delightful!!,"Eric Durchholz has crafted a marvelous tale. The Promise of Eden starts as a gentle ghost story and develops into a full blown assault on the senses.The book is worthy of comparison to Madeline L'Engle's ""A Wrinkle in Time"" in terms of creativity and style. Yet, the story is absent of Ms. L'Engle's preachiness and accepts all for who they are. The first person narrative keeps us with the main character at all times and lets us experience the story as we all experience life, from our own eyes. In a mere 204 pages, Mr. Durchholz crafts lives and worlds in a pace that never slows and made me unable to put the book down.The author shows great promise with this work. I anxiously await the sequel. Why only four stars? There should have been more!"
5,page turner!,"great book! If I didnt need to go to sleep (haha) I would have finished it in one day. Very enlightening, beautifully written and very suspenseful. I got intot he character very well and was wide eyed until the very end. Very recommended! great writer! I hope he comes out with more books like this. I would love to meet him and talk about his inspiration for this book."
5,Promise of Eden sequel a must!,"This book is one all worldly adventurous' should read. Packed with suspense and action your sure to get reading enjoyment. Don't pass this one up, read it. Can't wait for the sequel."
1,This is the essential Epic Trance track,"Nothing else speaks to me in such a way. I'm a veteran of Trance, live and and breath the stuff. The first time I heard this, it it literally took my life down a new path. Listening to it for the first time on E may have had a little to do with it, but it conjured up thoughts of just EPIC scenarios. Battles, Love, Hate, Journeys, New dimensions. I turned to my friend and asked...what would you call this? He replied, ""trance""...I said ""I know, but this is something more, it just seems epic to me."" he of course laughed, but after some research we found that it was indeed Epic Trance. In simple terms, this track severs flesh and bone. Strings are where it's at."
2,Not Worth It,"I love George Clinton and the P-funk, but this albums sounds horrible. Clinton especially sounds way off key, his voice ripped to shreds, singing words off mic, out of rhythm. The album has bad balance. It sounds like there's a hole in the middle of the mix, with all these brittle parts surrounding the hole that don't add up to much. I've seen the P-funk several times, but this doesn't capture the feeling of those shows. Skip this one."
5,AWESOME,"THIS CD AND SPECIALLY THE SETLIST ARE PRETTY COOL. THE NEW SONGS (SPECIALLY BOUNCE & SOMETHING' ) ARE SO COOL AND OF COURSE THE CLASSICS (ATOMIC, FLASHLIGHT). AWESOME STUFF. GEORGE CLINTON IS (40 YEARS LATER) STILL ON THE FUNKIN' TOP. GENIUS."
2,A remarkably mediocre album,"Given the talent involved, I have always been surprised and disapointed at how bad this studio recording is. Kanawa is even occasionally off-pitch, and she and Carreras show little of the verve and beauty that made them international stars. I'd look elsewhere for a recording of this wonderful score."
3,Fifty-niner's blues,"I was born in Paris in 1959 when West Side Story stormed France. If I had one intrauterine memory, that would be the movie sound track. I was born with it and grew up with it. My first English word was ""Tonight"". I owned the LP, the cassette, and now I have the CD (Always the same deep red cover with the fire escape). I can still listen to it everyday and get goose pimples. Te Kanawa and Carreras are fine singers, but they are NOT Maria and Toni. I am shocked that Lenny could betray his masterpiece in that manner. To me, the only other version that is worth listening is in ""Leonard Bernstein's NewYork"" where Dawn Upshaw, Audra McDonald and Mandy Pantinkin do bring the true characters to life."
4,Very enjoyable CD,Very pleased with this CD. It arrived in good condition and the music and singing is excellent.
2,Not for the novice.,"This may be a great video camera -- I wouldn't know. I have had this thing for a week and have spent hours and hours trying to figure out how to video conference with it. The instructions which come with the product are minimal at best -- oh, it is easy to install - but what good is a lifeless camera. You would think that setting up video conferencing would be easy - but, I wouldn't know and I am about ready to toss the thing into the rubbish. I had actually hoped to use this camera, silly me. So now I will be bugging everyone I know who might know something of how to use it as the manufacturers certainly didn't have novices in mind. It shouldn't have to be so difficult."
3,The camera by itself is excellent,"The camera in itself works excellent and is a technological masterpiece. You aim it into a dark room, but it still manages to soak up enough light to make the picture/video look like as it was taken in broad daylight. However, the software that comes with it feels outdated and unprofessional, and doesn't match that of the installation guide. When I tried to register the product electronically, it tried to register my modem instead. The 3Com website, where I had to go to find additional support when the first installation failed, didn't provide any help and was difficult to navigate."
1,Barely Works,"Very unhappy with this. Setup was a breeze contrary to much I have read but the picture quality is horrible because this camera is very used and very beat up. Upon first connect the images were a total washed out blur. I removed to lens to clean it all and it looked like milk or oil had been spilled all over this camera in the past. After much cleaning the images are now almost recognizable. Still very poor, I can't believe someone would sell a product, new or used, in this poor condition. Zero stars if I could. My $19 Labtec cam takes far better pictures. The 3Com HomeConnect might be good, I don't know because the one I got is in such bad shape."
4,Be Careful,Great camera. In fact if it weren't for the following problem I would give it 6 stars. The problem is the driver won't work with Windows XP and 3 Com is dicontinuing this camera so they aren't going to develop a driver that works with XP. Low blow 3 Com.
5,Best Netcam Ever Had,"This netcam is the best ever!! I bought this in October and got it exactly the same week i ordered it using the standard shipment. this netcam has alot of fetures and great software for recording your movies to sending them and talking great still imagies. it does alot of things like adjust to light for the best viewing and has a great focus and also records in ultra high quality. its very easy to install, it has very easy instructions on how to install it and you just plug it in and install the software and your ready to record. its a very small product, it looks inourmous on pictures but it's really small and fits in the palm of my hand. i give this 5 and out 5 stars, i had no problems using this. it works with netmeeting too, so u can use AIM to talk to people u know"
1,Never EVERY by 3Com again,"I like other customers have had this camera for some time. 3com's customer support let me know quickly that they will not support it for XP. With that kinda customer service, 3com will NEVER EVER get my business again."
3,The Ecclesiastical Rhine,"The book is beautifully illustrated and goes into great detail about the many churches and cathedrals along the Rhine. There is, however, very little about the castles that line the Rhine and practically nothing about other buildings. One would think that the old Germans did not live in permanent dwellings but only spent their time praying in church. A Really Good map would be appreciated. Going by the book, absolutely nothing of notice has happened along the Rhine since the 18th or 19th century."
3,"works OK, but cheaply made","Our company bought several of these Extech detectors. They work OK, and detect gas. So they do what they are supposed to. But they are cheaply made, and we have had to fix up the plastic housing on more than one. One problem we have had with 2 detectors is they need the internal potentiometer adjusted. One day the detection alarm simply is ON and says gas is present, when it is not. So we opened the unit up and adjusted the pot, and then they work OK again. But it works and are very inexpensive."
5,Great Book! Easy Read! Lots of Info!,"This book was short, easy to read, and was so informative and uplifting! What a help! The info put me on the right track for getting God's gift (my body & mind) back into shape!"
5,Best Diet Motivation EVER!!!,"Dr. Colbert's books are the most effective I have ever read. Besides the medical and spiritual advice, he writes so that the average person can FINALLY really understand what one must do and why it must be done. Dr. Colbert explains the rewards of following the advice versus the penalty for ignoring it. He is, without a doubt, the most motivating, intelligent, concise and easy writer to read of all the pack of weight loss gurus! Thanks, Dr. Colbert!!!"
1,Not What I Thought,I was looking for a way for someone to gain muscle mass in the midst of losing weight. This is more of a generalized thing.
5,How We Die,"It is such an interesting book. It's very well written, from the heart. I would recommend this book to anyone dealing with care giving. It helped me understand the process of growing old and dying. I've checked this book out from the library numerous times and realised I needed a copy of my own."
4,More than merely informative,"Dr. Nuland explains the dying process in detail, without sugar coating or sentimentality, in a way that is understandable to the general reader. More importantly, he shares his reflections on this process as a human being and as a doctor. The reader comes away from the book with information and wisdom not easily gained through other means. As someone loooking to revise his living will, I found the book immensely helpful. I should add that I was particularly impressed by Dr. Nuland's humility and his avoidance of all preaching. In so doing he credits his reader with intelligence and challenges him or her to think deeply."
3,Interesting Overview of Processes,"Interesting although dated, this overview takes a paternalistic look at major groupings of the reasons why the human body gives out.I thought the AIDS chapter (which was good for its time) could be updated as well as the one dealing with cancer.I also wish there were references listed at the end of each chapter (or grouping) for readers to go for more detailed information if they were interested."
5,this book actually made me wish i was dead,i mean no disrespect to the author when i say that this book makes me wish i was dead.
4,Sensitive presentation,"The subject of our own mortality is difficult to consider. However, this book allows the reader to contemplate all aspects of the end of life. The author's sensitivity and insight are like having someone to hold your hand as you undertake an unwelcome journey."
4,Pretty good for a debut CD,"This CD is quite good, but not really amazing. I would give it a 3 1/2 rather thana 4, to be honest. Some songs are great, like Crushed Like Fruit or Mosaic, but some are just filler material. It gets old quite quickly. The lyrics are sometimes unimaginative or pretentous, and deal with the same themes - death, suicide etc. But there are some moments on this CD that make up for the bad parts. Hopefully in their next album they will have matured, which will definitely improve the sound and lyrics."
4,Loving it!,"InMe are now one of my all time favoutites. With rockin' hits like ""Neptune"", and ""Firefly"", what more do you want?!I found out about InMe from a brittish friend of mine, and I hope they become popular down here! They deserve more fame and regignition.Love it! Buy it if you liked bands like Yellowcard and Three Days grace, But be prepared for unique vocals and catchy tunes."
2,Small bag for dive mask,"The bag is very well made, but the dive mask just barely fits inside. If it was a little bigger, I would give it 5 stars. But I have to squeeze my mask to make it fit. Unless they make the bag bigger, I would not recommend to others."
4,BE CAREFUL!,"These speakers work more than fine for music, CDs, MP3s, and some videos. Still, if you want to buy speakers for watching movies from a DVD, you will need Creative FPS2000 which is a package of 5.1 channel decoder (Dolby Digital, AC3, 5.1) and as it is obvious 1 main speaker, 4 satellites and 1 subwoofer. Much more powerful. Even better: the Creative's digital speakers (i think DTT2500) for pure digital sound! It is really disappointing to discover later that you can't enjoy the DVD's features in sound because of the FPS1000 speakers!"
3,Good cheap solution but not for professional use,This is the choice of speakers for someone who wants to hear 4 way gaming. If you want it for excellant music qulaity then forget it. The Subwoofer is useless if turned up to high. The volume control and stands are a welcome bonus and if you have the Soundblaster Live or Monster MX300 then you will have a GOOD PC solution. Gamers will be happy but for people who use their PC for recording and music play back you will not get the best out of your sound card with these. There are much better speaker out there - albeit for more money. Still the volume control is good.
3,Depends what you are looking for,"I've had these speakers for over a year and a half now and they do a solid job for the price. search around and find the best price. Don't expect spectacular results at the high and low ends of the volume spectrum. The speakers will tend to distort at high levels of bass. If you are a serious gamer or a music listener who loves to pump it up, go for something else. If you are the average JOe looking for very good sound at a decent price, you cannot find anything better. This system comes with 4 satellites so be sure to buy a sound card that can handle this. Soundblaster 128 and Live handle can handle this."
3,Yardbirds - 'Rarities' (Delta),"Decent,yet hard-to-find(I've never seen it until here recently)budget priced CD.Actually,by today's standards,this nine track disc is more like an EP.Nine tunes from the Clapton-era Yardbirds.Cuts I liked best were ""I Wish You Would""(great harmonica),the instrumental ""Draggin' My Tail"" and ""For Your Love"".A good effort,but I would only recommend this title to Yardbirds completists."
4,Lots of cards....,so many ideas and almost so little time to try them all!!you get an idea for a fun little game or position ---you can even mix-n-match the cards for a wild night of hot sweaty fun.
3,School,These were school requirements for my daughter. I will say that the price and how quickly it shipped was great.
1,Get it at the library because price is way too high,I agree with others that the publisher had better start lowering his prices or we will start using the library again when we want one of their books.I love Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch character but not at this price for my Kindle.Maybe I made a mistake and should have bought a Nook!
2,Why no bundle pricing???,I know that this review is not about the book itself but I do want to voice my opinion too. Why would I want to buy the Kindle version when you can get the hardcover or paperbacks for much less? I also noticed that if you buy vol. 2 & 3 together you get a better deal. WHY CAN'T KINDLE OFFER THIS TOO? If you buy one or more books of the same author for Kindle offer a discount just like you do for the books. I agree...I won't buy this until the price goes down.
5,Loved it.,"Three for the price of one, can't beat it. Brand new, shipped quickly and looks great. Reads like one novel."
4,"As always, Connelly",Love the Harry Bosch character. Never stop reading once I pick up the book.The publishers charge too much for an electronic book.
3,Harry Bosch,"I wasn't really at fan of this series at first, but I am finding that I like it more as I read more of them."
4,"Quick delivery, Condition as described","Quick delivery, Condition as described, good read, but the book is very big and difficult to hold..."
4,Michael Connelly Bosch books,The Harry Bosch Vol. 1 and 2 are such a great read and great deal. I started with one of Connelly's later novels and could not put it down. So I thought I would try to find all his earlier novels. The 2 book set which actually contains a total of the first 6 Bosch stories was just awesome to find and read. I highly recommend these sets to all Connelly fans and to anyone looking for a good pageturner crime/detective series. Truely captivating storytelling.
1,Stunned And Disappointed,"I was feeling like a kid at Christmas when I found that the Big Phat Band had a dvd for Swingin' For The Fences. The CD is a real favorite of mine and with all the new technology and the high-definition improvements available for video, I expected another awesome gem to add to my music library. What I felt I got was a real rip-off.Some may think the music carries the dvd, but my interpretation of a quality dvd is action to go with the music. This collection of still photos as the music plays along is a joke.I'd suggest Mr. Goodwin talk to the producer of Lee Ritenour's latest dvd release ""Overtime"" to find out how to put out a product that will give you goosebumps because of quality music and video together!If I could have given this a lower rating, I would have in an instant! If your thinking about getting this purchase, I suggest just get the cd - the music is awesome. If you want still pictures, don't spend $25 for them. Buy a good magazine!"
5,Your face is so conatgious,"I can't wait to see Emery at their show next month at Java Jazz in Spring, TX I have liked emery since February of this year, and I just can't believe that this album is as awesome as it is!"
3,Hard and Soft Collide - Is it Screamo or Emo?,"This album was long awaited by many. Emery's unique ability of mixing hard and soft vocals and instrumentals with amazing transition and sound captured much attention. Being with the Christian heavy label, Tooth & Nail also got Emery more attention.Weak's End delivered the long awaited taste of Emery. And I'd like to say that it impressed. The transitions between sounds and verses to choruses are outstanding. Both the loud and soft sounds of Emery sound like that of a band that has been around for a long time and has nailed their sound down."
2,"5 Stars? I'm sorry, we didn't listen to the same album?","*A note from Noath*This is only my opinion, so if you like this band good for you** Ok, so I read a couple of reviews about this album by Emory, and even heard a clip of it on MTV2 (I should have known then and there to avoid it....) so I bought the album. This was my mistake. I try to be open minded. I even like some of the nu-metal bands. But this falls into the wuss-rock area. This album may appeal to pre-teens or something, but for metal, screamo, or hardcore fans, be prepared to be massively dissappointed by this cd. Bottom line I wasted (...). I couldn't bring myself to listen to the whole thing, it is destined for the resale pile at my local music store, if I get $1 for it I will be lucky. Buy any other album from any other artist at random, even dig through a bargain bin, you might do better, but certainly couldn't do worse."
3,Good but not Great,"Yeah ok the songs are all solid, but there really isnt any great songs that get stuck in your head. copeland, senses fail are much better"
5,Emery is Amazing,"Emery was my introduction into the screamo scene and they really set the bar high. This album is packed with amazing vocal harmonies, both heavy and soft guitar riffs, and some nice screaming to go along with it. It's a must-have for any screamo fan."
5,A great one from tooth and nail,"this album is flat-out awesome. every song. i can hardly put it into words, but here goes. This album has good variety, good singing, good screaming, ang great guitars and drums. Best songs are Walls, Ponytail Parades, Disguising Mistakes With Goodbyes-aw man, they're all awxesome.CD grade=94/100"
4,If you're just curious...,"I think the best way to describe Emery's sound is this: If Anberlin and Showbread had a lovechild, it's name would be Emery.Check out all the Tooth&Nail; bands at [...]They make me happy...As far as this album goes, I'm not really into a lot of screaming...My CD player usually houses a healthy rotation of Anberlin, Jimmy Eat World, Eisley and Snow Patrol...but, because Emery is a Tooth&Nail; band (like Mae, Mewithoutyou, Dead Poetic, Watishi Wa, Anberlin, Showbread...)I figured they had to be pretty good. And as usual (ha), I was right. At least I can understand what they're screaming...Some favorite lyrics...a line in ""Walls"" goes ""Your face is so contagious/ it wears announcements/ it leaves me breathless...""""Inside this vacant, made-up, plastic life only your heart survived..."" from ""By All Accounts (Today was a Disaster)""All of ""Ponytail Parades""Just get it. I mean, gee..."
5,The best emo album ever.,"I bought the Weak's End thinking it might be decent, having read many raving reviews about them, but the first time I'd sampled some of their stuff I wasn't at all impressed. But then I got on purevolume.com, and downloaded ""The Ponytail Parades"", ""Walls"", and ""To Whom It May Concern""; and was really impressed with the emotion displayed.1. Walls 9/102. Ponytail Parades 10/103. Disguising Mistakes With Goodbyes 8/104. By All Accounts (Today was a disaster) 10/105. Fractions 8/106. The Note by Which a Chord is built 7/107. Bloodless 8/108. Under Serious Attack 8/109. As Your Voice Fades 10/1010. The Secret 10/10 (This is one of the best songs of all time...)"
3,sry too brake the 5 star marathon,"this cd is O.K. i only listen to the 1st n 2nd song, after that i hate it....with a passion..so ya i guess it is worth the money for the song walls cuz that song is very very good"
5,screaming to the top,"Been seeing a lotta folks and them talking about Emery. But i didnt have a clue about them or what they were really about. So after seeing it recommended to me by other people and amazon. I finally decided to break down and purchase ""The Weak's End"". Lets just say i'm glad that i did make that choice. Love it, normally i'm not really down with nor do i enjoy a whole lotta screaming in my music. But with these guys i actually enjoy it especially with songs like ""The Secret"", ""Under Serious Attack"" and ""Walls"".I'm liking them more and more with each listen to this cd. A worthy addition to my or anybody else's cd collection. So make that purchase if your on the fence about this band. You'll realize exactly what i'm talking about."
5,One of the best cd's of the year,I bought this cd without listening to it first and i was not dissapointed at all. The vocals and screaming go together better than i have ever heard before and the lyrics are touching and full of emotion. This is an all out perfect cd.
5,I've heard of them for quite some time.,"I've known them even before their release of this cd, i had the cd a few months before had. They actually live in the town I'm currently living in right now. And the drummer works at are local Starbucks. They are an awesome band, If you like screamo music (vendetta red, The Used, Senses Fail...etc.) You will love their lyrics with the added bonus of good flowing music. Their best song though I liked since i first heard of them was Walls, and that was even before they released this cd and before my friend gave me a copy to check out. They sound so good. A must buy to add to your screamo collection."
3,Understand,"Tom, understand what ""oz"" said. He was simply warning that the lyrics are preachy which people like myself don't like and that is something that is not listed on the CD or the song names, etc. It's not like other cds such as Norma Jean in that you won't notice the christian lyrics, but they are very noticeable in this album. Something I'm picky about, but apparently others are not.OK album. 1st song is fine, after that it's too slow and non-rock and non-screamy for my taste. Oh, wait, it's Emo --- I forgot :)"
3,one of the better JCS cds... worth buying,"this cd was one of the better JCS cds... the thing that dissapointed me about it most though is the lack of, im not sure what the word im looking for is , so ill just say passion. they sound alittle too singing, and not enough feeling. but it is a very good cd. you have to buy it."
5,The best JCS!,This is a must have for any JCS fan. This is without a doubt the best recorded Jesus Christ Superstar soundtrack. Steve Balsamo is absolutely awesome as Jesus. I have never heard a voice like his. Glen Carter (who sings the part of Simon on this CD)does a great job with his song. He went on to play Jesus in this production and is supposed to be playing the part of Jesus in the video that is to be released (Easter 2000). Joanna Ampil has a lovely voice. She makes a wonderful Mary. This is definitely worth adding to anyone's collection. This is my favorite CD.
2,Not a 'must',"Actually, I think they've done a good job but compared to original concept album....not so much strong. Most people are doing well but I really don't like Mary. I hate the performance. I just wanted to know how they sing and record JCS recently."
3,Casting a problem,"I like the message of JCS, and i thought that they made some good casting choices... and some pretty bad ones. If you heard the original concept album, you would agree with me that Yvonne Elliman was, and is, the best choice for Mary Magdeline. This new girl...ewwww. The emotion is very very fake. HOwever, I thought the casting for Judas was awesome. I had a good time listening to him. Jesus did some good croonin' too. THe rest of the the cast was poorly done. I think that the original album is what you should buy, if you want to gain an opinion of JCS.PS, I love Ian Gillan!"
3,Rather sad,"This movie tells a pretty good story, but I only give it 3 stars because there's too much sadness. it ends on a good note but the ending is too short to overcome the sadness, in my opinion."
4,Lovely and Comforting,What a lovely little movie. Sweet without being saccharine. I watched this during a particularly stressful time in my life and it was adorable and hopeful. The three elderly gentlemen were the best.
5,Great uplifting old movie!,"This is a wonderful gem that I've never seen before, even my teen age son enjoyed it. IT would be a great Christmas eve family movie with popcorn and egg nog.The Christian message is strong, a pleasure to watch for those in the faith."
5,If you like Skinlab or Slaves on Dope you'll love this CD.,This is an excellent relase that showcased the talent of these great artists. I belive this EP helped them secure their contract with Roadrunner Records. I can't wait for their next release in June 2001.
5,Tune-Your-Brain Series has consistent fine quality,"Another fine addition to the Tune-Your-Brain series. Contains 72 minutes of high quality Polydor & Deutsche Grammophone recordings. The ""Relax"" CD begins with light soothing pieces then transitions to slower more deeply relaxing music. Fine for unwinding or relaxing at bedtime. A nice selection of famous and lesser known compositions by Mozart."
5,Learning Made Fun,"I learned how to read, on my own no less, at age 3 with these books. The type is large and the books are easy to handle for young ones. The terrific Schulz illustrations make words come to life. I couldn't recommend these more."
1,i got ripped off,"the product was advertised as ""new""...far from it...paid almost $50 based upon that statement...other used books were available at less than $10...it was shipped wrapped in paper, not a box or bubble wrap...corners of book were damaged...delivery took forever, feel i got taken advantage of due to xmas...will not be doing any used book purchases thru amazon in the future...will deal direct with used book dealers w/o middleman...expected a certain degree of 'quality control' using amazon...overall bad experience...i would rethink using that seller if i was you...but, what's done is done...i got ripped off...live and learn...stephen"
1,disappointing and disturbing,"I bought this book for my daughter, who has CP, like the girl in the story. I was hoping that it would be a story about living with CP and becoming independent. And, while it was those things, it also had some disturbing undertones... one of her friends (also with CP) lives in an institution and his mother visits him there once or twice a week when she isn't working... reading this through the eyes of my daughter I am horrified. That particular impossibility is something that hasn't ever ocurred to her; I don't need this book to plant it in her mind. Also, ""being Sarah"" sounds like being a girl stuck in a family with a cruel and unthinking father, an overworked mother, and fears about being institutionalized. This does NOT get a good rating, and I'm glad I read it first -- I will NOT let my daughter read it."
1,Talking about people with disabilities,"I was very disappointed with the Product Description for this book. Saying that Sarah is a ""victim"" of cerebral palsy is not respectful, nor was the review from the School Library Journal that says that Sarah is ""confined"" to a wheelchair. Both ways of describing Sarah focus on the negative. That's not how I want my children to think about people with cerebral palsy. How about saying she ""has cerebral palsy"" and ""she uses a wheelchair""? These are statements of fact, rather than a judgment. Subtle but powerful!"
3,But why buy?,"Ok, let's see now. First there was the Who circa 1964. A little over a dozen years later you had the mod revivalists paying tribute to the Who. The top tier example was The Jam, then The Purple Hearts and the bottom was The Mods. Lyrics are mediocre, singing lacks passion and conviction, and the playing is marginal. You should buy it only if you think it has some kind of historical value but if you have any of the aformentioned bands I guarantee you will never give The Mods a spin."
3,"Good battery, but you pay the price","Guess we should expect that anyway. Buy an expensive camera and the accessories will cost you as well. Holds a charge for a long time even with lots of use. I shot over 180 photos in one afternoon, mostly with the onboard flash, and this battery still had plenty of juice. I rarely shoot without a backup, so I'm unsure how much I would trust it to last under that pace for a full day or more. I'm satisfied with the performance, but not the price.Another tip, look at the fine print for the battery type you need and order. I tried an off-brand EN-EL3 and it was not compatible with the EN-EL3e. Had to return it and pay a restock fee. My mistake."
3,Chinese Knockoff,I purchased this item on the assumption that it was a Nikon brand battery. Upon receiving it I found it to be a Chinese made knockoff. A previous battery I purchased from another supplier was a knockoff and its longevity was half of the Nikon brand. If it is a knockoff it should be advertised as such. I will never buy from this supplier again.
5,Works like a champ,"Amazon had the best price for this oem battery. Many other places have lower cost ones, but I didn't want to take a chance on them. I knew with this I was getting the exact same battery that came with my camera. I can't tell the difference between the original and this one. Of course there is none. These batteries give me in the neighborhood of 600 shots of mixed shooting (indoor, outdoor, flash, with display on, etc..). Great deal."
4,its a battery,"The new Nikon EN-EL3e battery is a slight update for the Nikon EN-EL3 provided with earlier dSLR models such as the D70. It adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery. The battery is grey to distinguish it from the black EN-EL3.The EN-EL3e is backwards compatible with the EN-EL3: you can put it in your D70 or D50. The reverse is not true.The number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors, including shooting style, LCD usage, and of course, camera. (The 2.5"" LCD on the D200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller D70.) It is sufficient for a day of shooting. Unless you are using a D200 in some professional capacity, in which case, you'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM,"EN- EL3e will disappoint you. They are not covered under any warranty and you will lose your pictures when it goes out.I purchase mine 6 months ago and it failed. Original batteries last 4 years. The upgrade (EN-EL3e) only last me 6 months.Nikon does not offer warranty on it own product brand.I have been a loyal Nikon customer since 1964. Nikon needs to know that they lost me to Cannon for good.good luck all,"
5,It's a genuine Nikon Battery,There isn't really much to say. Buy the Nikon battery it will last longer and more charges.
5,How do they do it,"This is a backup battery and I am amazed at how use you can get from a charge and the shelf life. I believe this is the only battery that will fit my D-300, but it does not matter. This is the one for me."
5,Always nice to have an extra battery!,I recommend that anyone who takes a lot of photos and likes to travel gets a second battery to have on hand.
5,Excellent genuine Nikon product,"I got this Battery from Amazon because I know coming from them it is a Genuine Nikon product and not a Knock off that will ruin my $5,000 Nikon Camera. I'm completely satisfied with the fast shipping, Fair price and the product I asked for."
1,"HORRID Battery, Won't hold a charge","This is a horrid battery. I charged it full, then put it in my D80. It worked for about 20 shots, then it showed empty. I recharged it just to make sure it was actually full. I put it in the camera again and it again showed empty! I would give it 0 stars if I could."
2,Not as the displayed picture,"When we received this product, the charger was gray not black, it fits the battery but doesn't look like the original, also the cleaning liquid was spread out the container... I hope it does the job... but I won't buy from this seller anymore..."
5,Camera Batteries,"I've had not problems with these batteries, which I've been using for about 5 years. I've been told, by the company from whom I bought the Nikon D 700, they they are better than the imitations."
3,It's Just a Battery,"I don't think a battery really requires a review, but a comment regarding D70 vs. D200 might be in order. In over two years of using my D70, I never felt the need for a second battery. After just a month with the D200, I'm ordering a spare battery (too bad the D70's battery can't be used in the D200).I'm not complaining. I now have VR lenses, and spend more time using the D200's menus, and reviewing pics on its large LCD screen. You can even watch your battery drain with the new 'battery info' screen, which does give you a better idea of how much juice you have left in a charge. I just no longer feel safe going out without a fully charged battery like I did with the D70 for a day's shooting.It's just a necessary expense, like buying a bigger flash card. I guess by buying an 4GB Ultra II instead of an Extreme III (or the new IV), paid for the battery."
5,Extra battery,"It's great to have an extra battery while the other is charging, although I found that one new battery lasted an entire one-week Cruise (about 800 pictures)."
4,Nikon EN-EL3e Rechargeable Battery,These batteries really hold a good charge. I used Ever Ready batteries once to compare. No contest. Nikon has done a great job in packing a lot of juice into these things.
5,nothing like the real thing,I have bought clone batteries in the past but there is nothing like buying the real thing. These have a long life and hold a large charge.
5,Nikon EN-EL3e,Great battery with plenty of life. I have four more of these batteries that I use with the MB-D200 and have never had a problem.
5,Works well,"Product exactly as ordered, and delivered on time. It's important to have a spare battery."
5,Luuukkkeee... iiitts the POW'A of the DAA'KKK siiiiddee!!!!,"This battery changed my life - it is an inspiration to me, and all who come in contact with me. Shall you only be so lucky to come into contact with merch of such greatness.Okay, really - this is a Nikon-brand battery for Nikon-brand cameras. It works great. Just wish I could get more than 400 shots out of my D200 with it.Don't by non-OEM - may void your warranty - that's why this battery is great. Nikon quality.Don't give into anger and hatred! Tis the path of the dark side! Buy this Nikon battery, instead."
1,Counterfeit,"After the warning photos on this page, I was surprised that the reseller still managed to sell me an open boxed, unwrapped, counterfeit battery.You would think they would be aware of the issue. Or maybe they are.I have two of the originals so the authentic Nikon battery works great. Going on a long trip thought I'd get one more."
5,Go With Nikon,Don't go cheap... just buy the one you know will work. You have already spent a lot on your gear so bet something that you know will work and that wont damage your equipment.
1,Counterfeit Nikon Products,Over the past year i have been purchasing numerous Nikon products adding to the tens of thousands of dollars. I had time to research Nikons website and to my amazement several of the purchased products are counterfeit. Now i have to check all my past purchases. BEWARE!!!
5,QUCIK SHIPPING,"HOW DO YOU REVIEW A NIKON BATTERY, PRODUCT WAS AS STATED, GOOD PRICE, QUICK SHIPPING."
4,oem is always safest,Going with the orig manufacture or orig part is always the safest!tried others and was unhappy with them . I rent motion picture and still lighting gear and the rental biz can be unforgiving. so you need to know your product well!!!!!!!!!!!!! I f a product doesnt preform you lose the rental and time be safe!!!!!!!!
4,Nikon Battery,It's a battery. Not much to say. It works and it charges and it provides about the same performance as the battery that came with the camera. Time will tell all about its performance.
4,Good battery,"It works as advertised. Long life, looks cool, decent price. It's 40 bucks, but it's freaking Nikon. You get what you pay for. Enjoy."
4,Great buy,I bought this for my Nikon D90 as a spare battery. It's great buy for the price and free super saver shipping.I recommend this product.
5,"Good battery, at least for the D80",This battery is excellent. It charges very quickly and can be used to take many shots using the D80. I think Nikon's claim of 1000+ aren't too far off.(Did not buy from Amazon.)
1,FRAUD DANGER NOT A NIKON BATTERY CHINESE COPY,"I bought this battery, since the picture shows a true Nikon battery, so I paid the price of a Nikon battery only to receive a BS Copy of this battery. This is Fraud and I will call my CC company and dispute the charges. DANGER DANGER"
3,Fast Charge,"This is the spare battery, was charged very very fast.I have'nt used yet. It's supposed to replace the main battery and shall see how long lasts.I recommend to have two batts for D200.MR"
3,Requires multiple charges to reach full charge,"Requires about 5 or 6 charges to reach full charge. Because of many power requiring features on the D200, a new battery will completely discharge after 40 frames during on-off shooting. The charger that comes with the D200 only charges for 2.35 hrs, which, as I discovered, cannot fully charge a new battery. I need several additional batteries and the MD200 battery pack to enable long battery life."
1,defective. no power,Battery I have received was defective. Just a bit of power (for no more than 20 shots in my D80 and D200. Package were well sealed and battery looks as an original one...but I had bad luck.
1,What battery?,"Amazon is asking me to write a review for a product I never received. Be wary of their ""shipping"" policies. I gave them a ground address to ship to and a PO Box for mailing/billing to. They ended up sending the product USPS to the ground address which is impossible because USPS does not deliver there. Instead of trying to correct the shipment error Amazon blamed me for the problem. Instead of sending the product to the correct address they issued a refund without asking me if this is what I wanted. Do not use Amazon if you have deadlines."
5,Quality batteries,"Well, as long as it's Nikon made battery, you can buy it anywhere and quality is the same. I have batteries that came with the cameras. They all worked well and lasted a long time up to now and still working.I bought some extra ones here at Amazon when on sale really cheap and they worked just as great. Just don't buy the third party brand. They don't hold or have that much juice."
5,Good battery! Just that!,"I bought this battery for use with my Nikon D90 and it's great, good for the average job duration, has an internal circuit that delivers load information to the camera and it's light. If you own a Nikon DSLR, buy this battery as a backup, and sure it will be useful at some time. If you need greater capacity, then you should complement your camera with the Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Battery Pack for the Nikon D80 & D90 Digital SLR Camera or a similar product."
3,Spare,"The battery is used a spare battery, does not last as long as original battery. Pay more and buy original manufacture battery"
3,Works,"It works so far so good. I use it in a D700, however it's not used every day. Been going several weeks now. Regarding batteries, I think that the main concern is whether the or not the supplier is shipping out fresh inventory when you buy them. I've noticed that name brand batteries usually work as they should, thus the three stars."
5,It does what its supposed to,"I bought this battery as a back up for my D70s. Although my camera cannot take advantage of all this battery offers, it out performs the original battery. I haven't had any problems with it. It does what it is supposed to without any complications. That, to me, is a great thing!"
4,Nice!,"I missed my late 80s over the knee suede boots, which is why I got these. They are great! The only thing that could be much improved are the soles and heel. They are very thing. I'd wear them out in a day. I had to have them resoled. But the Ammazon price was so good it was still a steal."
2,It works but no driver support for NT,"I have both a USB Video Phone Camera and this PCI Video Phone Camera and I found the USB one is half the price and better quality.This product is a pain to install and doesn't run on Windows NT or Linux. And the company doesn't even bother to post any updates to this product for Windows users. The the positive side, it does have a good mic."
3,"Great for online merchants, but mediocre for chating.","I'm sure this camera is fine for net-chats, but this device reaches its full potential for online auctions. Simply put your item on a lazy-susan, give it a spin, and take your video. This instantly provides a 3D effect for your customers. As for the camera...it is hard to get the camera level. The tension on the cord is enough to swivel it. And dont planning on using this with windows in the background; it makes a white glow around your face. However, the framerate is wonderful, and the picture is better than average for consumer-grade computer cameras. I'd recommend this camera to an online merchant rather than a nethead. Get a USB camera if you want to talk over the net."
3,3Com no longer supports Big Picture,"I purchased this cam several years ago and worked wonderfully in Windows 95 and 98. However, Windows 2000 will not recognize the driver. I contacted 3Com and was told that this product has reached the end of its life and they do not support it. If your OS is Windows 2000 (and probably XP too), do not buy this product. It will not work!"
1,win 2000,"doesn't support windows 2000 at all. Too bad, it could be a great camera/capture board but 3com refuses to support it."
3,I absolutely adore this camera,I received this wonderful camera in the mail and set it upwithin the hour. The PCI video card gave me a little bit of trouble but nothing I can't handle. My hat goes off to all the fine technicians in this company who put together such a fine piece of equipment.
4,An undiscovered treasure,"I'm into finding obscure music and then turning it on to my freinds and family.Well here's a little treat .I first selected Funky Espresso ""Soul A Rised"" cause I liked the name of the band.However, when I listened to the music I was totally sold.If you are into 1970's instrumental/ funk tunes you'll love this record.The record explores all types of groove music and I think it is great background music during a party or hanging with your mates .Well that's my two cents .Check it out."
1,Nice drive. Horrible company,My Terastation is just over a year old. I have replaced two drives so far. last week it failed to power up. I have been trying to work with their tech service for over a week. They never have anyone available to talk to you. They do not answer e-mails. After trying for three days I finally got a tech on the phone by waiting over an hour. He said he would replace the unit. He needed to fill out some paperwork and would call me back in 10 minutes. Two days later I got ahold of someone in sales who said she did not know anything about it and there was no record of my call. Then the next day I got an e-mail form to fill out for an RMA. I did and two days ago and have been unable to reach anyone since. Their support is so bad I would never buy anything from them again.
1,Nice Looking Drive with LOTS of Problems,"I purchased this 2TB drive about 6 months ago. Since then, I have had nothing but trouble. We have had to flash the OS 2 times and this weekend the unit went completely down. Now in order to get a replacement unit, I have to pay an additional $1900 for them to send me a replacement and then when they get the unit back, they will refund the money. This drive is a nightmare and I will never buy a Buffalo product again."
3,Good til they hiccup,"I have two of these units, a 1TB and a 2TB, due to a power failure and UPS issue both units had an uncontrolled shutdown. I was able to get one unit re-installed and setup for Active Directory after about 3 hours. The other unit is still down.Buffalo support means well but I get the feeling they really don't know the product. I got a long wait for customer service and a helpful fellow with comments like ""that's odd"".These units worked exceptionally well until this incident. I would not trust them to hold mission critical data again."
4,John meets Yoko,"Well acted and involving made-for-TV movie depicts John Lennon's life with Yoko Ono, spanning their meeting from November 9th 1966 to his untimely death on December 8th, 1980. Mark McGann gives a believable performance as John Lennon, with all his little quirks and idiosyncrasies. Kim Myori holds her own as Yoko Ono, although she's portrayed more sympathically than history plays her. Movie just glances over some of the more ""negative"" aspects of their relationship, like John's Yoko-approved affair with secretary May Pang, or their brief flirtation with heroin. But in all fairness, this movie doesn't deny anything they did, whether it was liked or disliked. Definitely engrossing for Lennon fans, and it's a shame that this is such an overlooked item."
3,Not a bad story,"The story and acting aren't bad in this movie-but the actors don't really bear much resemblance to the actual people. Ringo, George and Paul look about as much like the Beatles as a cow looks like a horse-despite that, the story is interesting. This movie is out of print-but I found a copy in a bargain bin for $2.99. Worth watching, but I wouldn't recommend paying an extreme price for it!"
4,Valuable,"If you study Japanese sword arts this video is certainly worth the effort of watching. The video encompasses the basics of kendo. It shows basic strikes, several matches, the kata and the Omori Ryu Iaido is demonstrated as well. The film was made in the early sixties which was before the All-Japan Kendo Federation finalized the seven Iaido forms and as such these forms are not demonstrated. The film is also grainy, and occasionally difficult to follow and the commentary is very basic. But, it has the potential to be a very valuable asset in the study of Kendo and Japanese sword arts in general. It is well worth the money and the effort to get."
3,Solid introduction to analysis,"I used this book in conjunction with Little Rudin while studying analysis. While Rudin provided deeper insight, it provided almost no motivation or exposition. Rosenlicht and Little Rudin are very good complements to one another. I found Rosenlicht much easier to learn from, but use Rudin as a reference now that I understand the theory."
1,This book is completely terrible,"We used this as our textbook for our undergraduate real analysis classes A and B. No one could understand the book. The professor ended up writing his own notes and homeworks for us, and in the end we stopped using the book altogether. He admitted that we only used this book because it was so cheap! But it's a terrible text for someone not well versed in math or real analysis already. The writing style is hard to understand because it's so old, and the book skips parts of proofs or mentions them in passing so that you have to connect the dots yourself. Avoid this book if you are trying to learn this material and you are inexperienced with math. About a third to half of this book is covered in a much more clear and understandable way by Elementary Analysis: The Theory of Calculus by Kenneth Ross. Another at least half can be found online at [...]. I used both of those resources as a supplement to this stupid text, and hey, I got As..."
3,Nuttiness in the US Military,"This is a book about people who think they can will a goat or hamster to die or walk through a wall, or project what other people are thinking. Clearly nutty, but something that can be believable in today's military. As one the previous reviewers have noted, there is not much documentation on this, and the stories are kind of strung together, but they clearly show that someone wasn't thinking when they went into this area. Blacks ops should not be exploring this realm. I believe the military is using subliminal messages in music piped into prisoners cells in Iraq and Cuba. I say, hit them full force with the Barney song until they crack.The flow of this book is not great, and there is little to prove what the author alleges. However, I believe that there is much truth in these nutty allegations. I wonder how much taxpayer money was shoveled into this stupid idea."
4,You got my goat!,"Ronson writes with a simple style and he seems to have a sixth sense for comic irony. But some subjects in the book are disturbing. He covers the unlikely fusion of new age ideas with military strategies. Sometimes I thought the purpose was just to cynically use the ideas for a cover for black operations. If death and torture can be made to seem absurd or funny, the public is not outraged by it. For example, Ronson covers the musical torture of playing children's songs over and over and how one man involved with the CIA might have been killed by an LSD overdose."
3,WHO KNEW?,Lots of craziness in the world...not so sure I appreciate knowing the U.S. military is part of it. What I do appreciate is knowing about it thru this detailed book. Eisenhower once said something to the effect...keep an eye on the military. He was right!
5,i've since bought everything by jon ronson,"Really good journalism, a number of disturbing discoveries, warm-hearted prose and understated English wit. This book is absolutely gorgeous and Jon Ronson deserves acclaim for it. I've read it several times...and I'm still staring at my hamster.`Them' is maybe better. That's only maybe. This is incredible."
4,Truth is stranger than fiction,"For those who would dismiss Mr. Ronson as anti-American, anti-Republican, etc., I offer this: in the roles of either participant or eye-witness I was ""there"" for every bit of US Army insanity the author describes that occurred between 1980 to 1999. He neither exaggerates nor invents. Although the author hasn't gotten the whole story on everything, if I fault Mr. Ronson for anything, it's that he is too kind. :("
1,The Men Who Stare at Goats,"This book has a good hook. But it fails to deliver. I tried to keep interested but chapter after chapter failed to deliver anything of substance. It would make attempts to tie things together from a few sketchy details from people obviously not mainstream and I have 21 years of military experience and was very interested in the fact this was touted as a true story. While I believe that the events described are true, the vagueness and lack of detail and follow-thru left me very empty and disappointed that with all the hype this story did not deliver. This writer has an agenda and while I agree truth is stranger than fiction if you claim a true story and stake a claim fully string your fact together and make your case stick! This was a wild goose chase that got so absurd I couldn't make it past halfway with out throwing it down in disgust. Save your money."
3,Fun and facetious for what it is - a movie-tie-in,"A quirky semi- (pseudo?) historical account of how the field came about, with highlights (or more like re-countings of the high jinks they get up to) from some of the key players and well-known practitioners of remote viewing. The author's facetious tone and tendency to paint all characters as larger than life, however, did not help - especially given the easy skepticism that the subject matters tends to attract - although some may see the frivolousness as a preemptively defensive stance. As a tie-in with the movie however, this volume does a good job in keeping with the light and incredulous spirit of things."
3,"incredible, cyncal and biased",related reading of various other sources cast some doubt on this author's point of view.
2,Making the simple look foolish,"Ronson whines that his books aren't as popular in the US as in the rest of the world. Perhaps because he insults his subjects, approaches them with disdain and ridicule.America has its kooks and eccentrics, but we rather like them. Ronson adopts the smug smirkiness of a David Letterman to get a few yuks.Then he decides the war on terror is a joke.I found his THEM to be engaging, mostly because he found that some of the ""wackos"" were just guys having a good time, and it was those who believed in the ""Thems"" that were the weirdos. for example, the Bohemian Club. In ""Goats"" the um, kid gloves are off, I guess."
1,Audio book review,"Jon Ronson's book is a work of genius. The film is, well, OK. The audiobook is just plain embarrassing. The book is very quirky, funny and (in a nerdy liberal way) intellectual. The narrator sounds like he's doing a voice over for a hemorrhoids commercial. And not one of the leading brands. I've never heard such a lack of inflection outside of a Philip Glass opera. On the plus side, he does manage manage to pronounce most of the one of one and two syllable words correctly, but more than that and it's a bit of a crapshoot. Such a shame."
2,Was hoping for more.,This book is not very well written and I was hoping it would go into more detail than it did. One of the few cases where a movie was actually better than the book.
3,Stranger than fiction,"I picked up this book because I enjoyed the movie. The beginning of the book is funny and the writing is light. You get a chuckle from conversations between the author and the interviewees and how people try to walk through walls or burst clouds. This section is a page turner and more fascinating than fiction.From the middle of the book on however, the book deals with more serious topics, such as MK-ULTRA, Heaven's Gate, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo Bay. Although still fascinating, this part was somewhat dry, and I found the pace of my reading slowed a bit.This book has some very enlightening information. Certainly there will be skeptics out there. But do we really know what happens behind any closed government doors?"
5,Disturbing read,"Mr Ronson's book is an eye opening, disturbing, and captivating read. Once you get started and immersed into the book it is hard to put down. The book ventures down some rather dark and disquieting paths. He illustrates how thin the line between good and bad is. In the same vein, right and wrong seems to be irrelevant to many of the subjects covered in the book. The scary part is that someday these guys or their students might actually get it right. All told, the book is a fascinating read."
3,Fell Short of What it Could Have Been,"The title says it all. This was a fun movie, but it really could have been more. Well worth a rental or a download but adding the DVD to your collection . . . meh."
1,uuhhh....crap...,"Fascinating tale? Yes? Believable? Anything is possible with the US government but Ronon's serious lack of resources other than interviews with the people, who for all we know could be a bunch of liars, makes it hard to distinguish this book from several episodes of the X-Files.I was looking forward to reading this but was totally disappointed. Not worth wasting your money."
1,nonesense movie,George Clooney is ought to start playing in better movies or I will stop watching movies with him. And that will include The American another nonesense...What had happen to those movie makers?
2,There are no occult activities by this great President,Crazy books like this and America's Keenest City and the Illuminati try to tell us that our leaders are engaged in weird occult practices or worship octopuses or other assorted nonsenses. At least the latter admit to being novels.There are no secret CIA occult industrial societies dancing in the woods directing what goes on. If you are kept down it is your own doing. George Bush is doing a great job because he has worked to get to the top. Men's lodges with funny handshakes went out of fashion two centuries ago.
4,Another quirky charmer from Jon Ronson,"I've always liked the way Jon Ronson writes, and this book is no exception. He remains open-minded about incredulous things when it would be much easier to scoff. He avoids the cheap shots and lets you draw your own conclusions from what he observes. And you get the sense that he retains a great deal of fondness and respect for even the most bonkers of his subjects.The Men Who Stare At Goats is a little flimsy but still entertaining and diverting."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this would be funny, or maybe interesting, and it was in parts, but overall it just seemed jumbled."
3,Fun Book,"The book is quite entertaining and admittedly held me to the pages. Not sure how and what to take seriously when reading this book, especially when watching the movie that quickly followed (too quickly).It is like an entertaining amateurish Chomsky book that one does not know how to take, a serious Michael Moore but comedy.Worth a go if you appreciate such themes"
5,interesting and entertaining,"Although I'm certain this is not entirely true, and it's probable that some of the sources are fabricating their stories, this is still an interesting look at some of the kookier experiments of the military and intelligence establishment. Some of the stories and positions presented are more plausible than others --the Frank Olson case as presented seems plausible. I doubt the existence of the First Earth Batallion...not enough good evidence was presented, same with the goat staring.Nevertheless, this book was well-presented and very entertaining. Those that debate the validity of Ronson's sources are missing the point...half the story was that of the characters that claim to have been a part of these elite units.There's certainly some truth to the sections on PSYOPS and the Mk-Ultra experimentation. Although to what extent, we can't be exactly sure. This isn't a scholarly look at those topics, just a highly entertaining narrative by a very funny journalist/documentarian."
3,"Interesting Subject, Poorly Written","I really wanted to like this book. The subject matter is fascinating, and worthy of inclusion in Michael Shermer's ""Why People Believe Weird Things"". Middle to senior Army types who actually believe they can walk through walls? Experiments trying to kill animals through thought control? ""Remote viewing"" of military secrets? Sounds like fun.What detracted from the subject matter was the actual writing of the book. Someone get this man a good editor! Mr. Ronson's writing style is so formless that it resembles stream-of-consciousness. Points and incidents mentioned early in the book are repeated needlessly in later chapters. Obvious thematic threads are ignored and instead a jumble of often random incidents and anecdotes are haphazardly strung together.Too bad. It could have been a lot better than it is."
2,I hope he realizes...,there are a lot of us on active duty who think that yanking the chains of visiting reporters is all kinds of fun.
2,Writing style seemed childish,"I didn't make it halfway through the book. The style seemed like something a junior-high school kid would have produced. Maybe I was having an off-day, but it put me to sleep."
4,"Read, be entertained be scared.",I enjoyed this book it was well written and easy to read. The only problem with it was that it's not a story that is why you should be scared.
3,Difficult to Know,"It's hard to know what to make of Ronson's book. I bought it because I saw him on C-SPAN2's BookTV, and found him engaging and credible, with a keen sense of the absurd. But as others here have noted, his book is thin on documentation, and the claims made in it are outlandish. On the other hand, if they are true, they're just the sort of thing you would expect there to be scant documentary evidence of. Therein lies the rub.Either way, the book is well-written, and quick and entertaining to read. My suggestion is to read it for yourself and form your own conclusions about its claims. And by the way, if you find the sort of thing Ronson writes about interesting, you should rent the DVD ""Suspect Zero,"" starring Ben Kingsley, which covers some of the same territory and includes some documentaries on one very odd military program."
2,Just not engaging,"I really want to like Jon Ronson's work. I left The Men Who Stare at Goats the way I left Them, though - fun anecdotes, interesting people, but no actual development of the story - no tying together what's happening. I'm not looking for a lot of piercing analysis, but I felt like every chapter was ""... and then I met Bob!""It's an opportunity to deliver a great book, and I just found it boring to read.Ronson also draws news-like conclusions with no supporting information. For example, he quotes the Iraqi propaganda materials dropped on US armed forces members that said ""your wives are back at home having sex with Bart Simpson and Burt Reynolds,"" and then says that the US propaganda was obviously more effective than that. He doesn't justify this statement, though - how do we know that our materials weren't as foolish when translated into Arabic? It's just sloppy writing, and it happens again and again."
1,Could go a little bigger.,"I owned two of these in my computer back in 1997. At the time that was a reasonable amount of disk space for a small machine. Now, however, I suggest you look into a slightly larger capacity drive, for example 160GB or more."
2,Author has a major conflict of interest,"I got this thinking it would be helpful in my job as a HIV Case Manager, was I wrong. The author has a major conflict of interest with the pharmaceutical industry and it skews his viewpoints tremendously to the detriment of the patient. The only reason I rate this at 2 stars is it is good at approaching the emotional and psychological aspects of being newly diagnosed and the stigma associated with it. Avoid any of the chapters dealing with medical treatment!"
4,change over time,This is an excellent book to use to introduce the concept of change over time to young children. I used it with first grade students. It took several weeks to receive the book after ordering it though.
3,Look through my window,"Jeannie Baker's pictures are beautifully done, each one an original collage of a subtly changing landscape. The story is a little bleak, however, and kids don't seem to enjoy realizing that their world, at first so lovely, is bound to become a slum and an overcrowded prison of tormented souls. Why so ugly, Miss Baker? When you look through your window, do you just see the grimy side of life? Cheer up, and if you can't cheer up, maybe you could write some books for adults, who have the forebearance to hear your wailings of doom.What's great about the book is the animation of the child, who grows up to be a man, and yet he plunges himself into ruin by siring a hostage to fortune. The story has a sense of balance which approaches the Shakespearean but, as I say, may be too heavy for most kids. Exposure to WINDOW will cause your children to grow up into neo-Goths, not that that is such a bad thing."
3,For modelers,"Even if you didn't much care for ""The Thin Red Line"", you should get this book for general information (though a bit short) on the Guadalcanal long drawn battle.In the usual Campaign series format, highlights from the book are the topological maps in 3D and the uniforms and equipment sketches. (These drawings actually come from other Osprey series, such as WARRIORS, MEN AT ARMS, or ELITE.)You could also get MIDWAY 1942 from the same series, to get more information on Pacific battles during that year of WWII."
4,They are beautiful but...,These bracelets are beautiful and the colors are just perfect. The only problem I have with them is that they are very small. I had to give them to my daughter because they would not fit me and even she said they seemed very snug. I would still recommend they but with caution.
2,they have potential but this isnt a great album,ive heard some good songs by the ripmen. but this album didnt have any really catchy songs on it. i dont recommend it
3,Game Plan,As a love of military history I purchased this on a lark I was presently suprised at the information it contained on the Rhodeisain War.
1,"Which is worse, the acting or the plot.","This is one bad movies. I am a devout horror fan, but I was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie. The acting is worse than bad, it's a joke. The plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous. Save your money. Even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive. There is no humor, no likable characters, not even a decent quote or one liner. by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion, you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back. So save yourself disappointment and keep looking, this movie is the biggest bomb, I have stumnbled across in years."
1,not worth your time,"The title says it all. Not scary, not good, and awful plot. Don't waste time or money"
3,charles dexter wards in live,"a good movie, very creepy, a good idea for game masters of call of cthulhu rpg."
3,"Not good, but the best so far","Lovecraft stories have yet to be turned into good movies, or good TV shows. Even the great Rod Serling failed to make a decent Lovecraft show. Still, for what it's worth, I'm glad to see this movie released. Based on Lovecraft's short novel ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"", it's not too horrible. The movie people do add Ward's wife, who didn't exist in the story, and a private eye, who also didn't exist in the story, but they also remove Dr. Willett, who was one of the main characters in the story, so I guess it kind of balances out. The feel is good, though, and actually fairly Lovecraftian. I was impressed with the acting, because Chris Sarrandon was the only name I was even barely familiar with, and then it was because of Susan that I knew his name. If you love the tales of Lovecraft, and also love movies, then this movie is by far the best adaptation. Almost as good as ""In the Mouth of Madness"", although that is NOT really a Lovecraft story. It just feels like it."
4,The Closest Thing to Lovecraft Directing...,"This is by far the closest thing I have seen on screen to a true Lovecraft adaptation. Well, besides the fun silent B&W; 'Call of Cthulhu' that came out in 2005 (2006?).Anyway, this is the closest-to-Lovecraft-original COLOR film (with sound even!) I have seen and I really loved it. Thank you so much Dan O for making this genuine."
1,Sharp viewcam VLNZ100,I have a VLNZ100 Digital viewcam. I lost my accesories. Included my cables and my battery. Can some one help me to locate a battery and cables part number. Thank You
1,Made up story,"Not only is this book not written in the right order but also not a true story. This lady has newer been in any concentration camp. Even her brother Piet(not his real name)denied ever have been in a concentration camp. Cato's neighborhood has newer been bombed for hour and hours or any other places in Amsterdam. Amsterdam has no sewers you can walk in, as is written on page 85 in this book. Also on the same page it says, Jews were forced in a ghetto with a high brick wall aroud it. Not true, I am Jewish, I lived in Amsterdam at that time, my Grand Father and Aunt and Uncle's lived there with there Family's and non of uf had a wall around us. The hunger winter was in 1944-1945, the American Air Force dropped food just out side Amsterdam on May 6th 1945. The execution on page 103 dit take place on March 1945, not in 1943. How did Cato could have seen the execution and seen the food drop if she was in Dora concentration camp? Dont believe this story, do some investigation. (...)"
1,Don't be fooled!,"This book makes a total mess of history. Numerous incidents described in this book just did not happen. A few other incidents which are described as having happened in Holland early on in WWII actually happened close to the end of the war. According to the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the Jewish History Museum (Amsterdan, Holland) and the Mittelbau-Dora Memorial (Nordhausen, Germany)this book is a total work of fantasy. Please don't be fooled by the title. This book is definitely not ""A True Story""."
3,True or not.......,"Seems like there's some kind of campaign against this author and book by one person or family. Amazing that they think they need to submit five separate reviews, containing the same information. Believe the story, or don't believe it. Its a fantastic story of survival, just like the book ""A Million Little Pieces"", featured in Oprah's book club. That book turned out to be completely fabricated, but it helped people and was a great story. I'd recommend ""Too Stubborn to Die"", true or not. I wouldn't put too much stock in what this family of ""critics"" are saying on here because they certainly appear to have some agenda."
1,Not a true story.,"On a request of a TV station in Salt Lake City,I did a review of the book Too Stubborn To Die.Autor, Cato Jaramillo.After extende research and my personal experience during 1940-1945 in Amsterdam Holland I came tot the conclusion this book is not a true story.Here are only a few facts: Amsterdam never had a Jewish Ghetto with a high brick wall around it. Amsterdam has no sewer systeem that you can walk in.The food drop by the American Air Force did take place in May 1945 not in 1942 or 1943.The exucution of 30 men(no young boys)did take place in March 1945. Not in 1943.Amsterdam Noord was bombed once and hospital by mistake.Both those places are miles away from where the Author was living.Concentration camp Dora did not yet existed on Aug.1943.Dora had 2 ovens not 10 and no gas chambers.Plus many more facts that are wrong or did not happent."
1,This book is not a true story.,"Here are a few facts,Amsterdam never had a Jewish Ghetto with a high brick wall around it. Amsterdam has no sewer systeem you can walk in. Amsterdam Noord got bombed once by mistake and that was about 15 miles away from where Cato lived.Her neighborhood was never bombed.The food drop by the US Air Force by Amsterdam did take place on May 1945 not some time in 1942 or spring 1943. Hitler never was in Amsterdam or any other place in Holland. The execution,on page 103 did take place on March 1945,not in 1943. The concentration camp Dora where Cato arrived in Aug 1943 did not existed yet as a camp.Want too know more?"
5,Too stuborn to die-,"I have read this book. I learned a lot about human nature and the author's undying desire to live. I ask you to consider going through a horrific experience such as a concentration camp in WWII. Would you remember every single date and detail? Or would things start to blend together and become confusing to you? A few reviews are questioning the authenticity and validity of this work. The complaints are made against discrepancies between dates and other events. If these minor problems define the historical accuracy of this non-fiction work, then I suggest you not read it. But, if you want an amazing tale of survival and renewed faith in man kind- then this is the book for you."
2,Not impressed,"I used this bench for a little over 9 months.The back piece was misaligned when I received the bench, causing me to lean a little to the left when lying back on it.The plywood in the seat began breaking after about 3 months. It has little support from the steel frame of the bench.The frame began swaying back and forth at the joint that connects the bench to the front feet after about 6 months of use. That probably was partly due to my using a little more than the maximum rated weight on the leg attachment (I used 160 lbs, max was 150).I was not impressed with the design of this bench or the quality of the materials used in it. I stopped using it when it seemed like a safety hazard to continue using.Aside from going over the max weight on the leg attachment, I went easy on the bench, trying to keep it in workable shape. I never lifted dumbbells heavier than 80 lbs, and at 160 lbs I was hardly putting more than average strain on the bench."
1,Not 'high quality equipment',"Unless you're using very little weight, I would not recommend this purchase.Construction is poor. The pivoting piece was so out of square that it required replacement. With 50# mounted, the back leg raises off the floor. With 100#, the upright soon broke from the base."
4,An excellent album!!!!,"When I popped this CD into my player I immediately loved this band! The first single, ""Into the Ocean"" and the second, ""Supercool"" bring various images to the mind. Their influences must be immence because their style cannot nor should not be narrowed down."
4,I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT !!! I LOVE THEM!!,I THINK FRETBLANKET IS REALLY GOOD!!THE CD COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT MORE POPY!! BUT IT WAS NOT . SINCE THEY ARE ONLY IN THRE 20'S I THINK THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO!!
5,Twight of the Gods,"I loved the music and look forward to listening to full production of Wagners work. However, I don't think Wagner would appreciate the CD cover art, I know I didn't!"
3,The Good and the Bad,"There is a lot to like about this CD. It is the Wagner for ""beginners"" with the best known preludes, overtures and much more. The Berlin with Karajan and the Bayreuth Festival with Bohn among others make a gorgeous Wagner. Now to the bad. There is no space between the different selections, and a person who is just being introduced to Wagner could not know which selection is playing. Even worse is the ""fade away"" of the music before it is actually over. That is atrocious! I would recommend the many CDs by Wilhem Furwangler directing Wagner that are available here at Amazon."
5,"Crisp, Concise, and Dramatic!....no filler needed!","These discs are a tremendous value at the price. The recording is faithful and wonderfully mastered. I have this set in my auto changer set for those times when Wagner is needed in smaller doses than at home. These are the best selections from Wagner, from the thunderously powerful to the intricately delicate. Mostly instrumental, there is just enough vocalization to remind us of Wagner's operatic focus. For someone investigating Wagner, I would heartily recommend this as a ""first purchase""! Veteran Wagner fans will deeply appreciate the mix sequence, crisp recording, and value. As for the jewel case graphic, it beckons me back to a darker time in our history, not German romanticism, yet it reminds me that maybe it's time to wax-up the Yater again. SURFDEEP!"
5,A great addition to my music collection,"This CD takes the place of all my other Wagner music. VERY well done. Somehow I didn't realize that there were two cds in the package--what a pleasant surprise! Of the two cds, I like the first one best, but they are both good. I listen to this cd daily on my way to work. Stirring! I am so glad that I purchased this. Some purists might have a problem with the fact that some of the selections are not there in their entirety. I have no problem with that though. I recommend this to anyone who loves Wagner."
5,A Must Have for Silent Screen Lovers,"This is a wonderful book. The author has done her homework and her picks from the famous to the forgotten were excellent choices. If she couldn't confirm a rumor, rather than speculate, or worse yet, sensationalize, she plainly stated the answer would probably never be found.I recommend this book for all lovers of the silent era. I only wish that Ms.Golden could do full length bios on these people."
4,Left You Wanting More,"This book provides 4-5 page biographies of many silent film stars. Some are very familiar to film buffs such as Rudolph Valentino, the Talmadge Sisters, etc. but others are not as familiar such as Martha Mansfield, Milton Sills, etc. Golden's writing style is so easy to read and she has done a great deal of research. Many of the biographies left you wanting to read a great deal more about many of these people. I would recommend this for all silent film buffs!"
1,Vanilla Ice Cream is so much better!,"This review is just based on the flavor, not the product. The product is greatNot sure what made me pick this flavor, but it doesn't taste that good at all!Taste:Like a chemical blend of artificial sweetener with a small hint of Vanilla extract, it taste absolutely disgusting. You would think by adding fruit or something it would taste better, but that is definitely not the case. IT CLASHES WITH EVERYTHING FRUITS/VEGES ALIKE!Bottom line: GO FOR VANILLA ICE CREAM! So much better taste."
5,My favorite album,"This is positively my favorite Canadian rock album of all-time! This new version has several bonus songs, including their great and hilarious ""Disgusteen""-currently available on ""Frantic City"".We need this back in print!!"
4,Excellent glimpse at WWII From The Foxholes,"This book is so well known by WWII readers that it needs no comment from me. You are not getting the world leaders or over all commanders view here. With MacDonald you are out in the forest, down in the foxhole and in the captures structures moving a company forward into enemy fire. The leading edges of battle are the platoons that are carrying the fight forward and MacDonald is mostly right behind them and sometimes with them, directing their activity as much as it can be directed; often reluctantly, based on commands from the rear from a batallion commander that can't see the danger like he can but commands from a larger view. A complelling look at retail warfare! If you want to know about WWII, this is one of the books that MUST be on your reading list."
5,Company Commander,"You can almost smell the gun smoke, hear the terrible noise, smell the blood and gore, listen for sounds in the night. I guess it is as close as you can get to the life of a rifleman in combat ."
5,An ex-marine's review,"An excellent book about the leadership of an army officer during thecrucial battles that ended WWII in Europe. As an untested officer throwninto the Battle of the Bulge he performed magnificently. His mettle was sorly tested,and his humanity shone through. A very,very good read"
5,a classy and classic book,"This is a very realistic account, and gives the flavor of what war was really like better than any book I've read."
1,Company Commander,"Some people can write and some ..., Woody Allen is credited with the line, ""80 % of life is just in showing up"".MacDonald was certainly there and he gets full points for that, but somehow he manages to makeWWII seem incredibly dull. But God Bless him, he was there."
3,Intresting,"I didn't care for this book. Although it is certainly well written and authentically documented, the story in my opinion is dry and boring. I've read many WWII books that presented the same kind of information that were interesting and entertaining at the same time. Perhaps it's the literally style I don't like. Surly the content is worth while. I would never discredit the memory of our combat veterans and I am certain that this book honors them for the sacrifice they made. If you are a WWII enthusiast please do not pass this one over on my account. It merits your attention."
3,An OK War Memior,"MacDonald's tale of a green company commander thrust into the a veteran outfit sounds interesting but lacks substance. MacDonald's feelings of insecurity around the veterans of Item Company are interesting but the story lacks any real meat. The details that make an interesting story are missing. His book mentions tons of names but beyond a few characters they are just names. I strongly suggest ""Foot Soldier"" by Roscoe C. Blunt instead."
5,Doing the right thing . . .,"This coming-of-age film from Kazakhstan follows the adventures of a possibly slow-witted teenager who gets involved with a kind of Fight Club, and when one of the fighters dies, the boy befriends the fighter's girlfriend and the man's young son. Performed with complete credibility by a nonprofessional actor who'd never appeared in a film before, the young man, nicknamed Schizo because of his apparent mental condition, observes, listens, and learns about life from the various adults he encounters. Meanwhile, he's never outwitted by any of them.Life in Kazakhstan is not easy. Everyone scrapes by, makes do, sometimes sleeps rough, and trusts no one, yet the filmmakers find a way to make this world neither dreary nor despairing. Schizo clings to a kind of human decency, even while he loses his innocence, and while there's hardly a single good influence around him, he instinctively does the right thing. A disturbing but satisfying film."
1,Not for Zoom H2,Amazon offered this item as an add-on for the H2 Zoom recorder. The screw on the addapter does not fit into the base of the H2 recorder.
1,Bait and Switch,Although this product was recommended with the purchase of the H2 audio recorder. It doesn't fit. And there is no return on it so I got scammed out of my fee purchasing this. Buyers Beware! Just because something is recommended when you buy something on Amazon DOES NOT MEAN IT IS COMPATIBLE AND WILL FUNCTION!
2,"fits, but fragile","I tried this adapter to go between a 5/8"" mic stand and a boom that was threaded 3/8"". I tightened the adapter into the boom with a pair of pliers and it snapped right off. This adapter would work to adapt a mic clip to a stand, but nothing heavier than that."
5,time saver!,this product eliminated the need for me to buy new mic clips or to change my mic stands!
1,Led Lenser = Failure,"I have owned 3 V2 models that the company I work for buys for us maintenance technicians. All the have failed, the switches always seem to go out. These things have incredible light power when they are working but they will quit working in a few months."
3,"lost first one, went out bought another","I really like this flashlight. I lost or misplaced my first and within 2 days went and purchased another. The second one I dropped onto the concrete garage floor while it was on. I saw it land on the cap and the light go out. That really disappointed me. I expect a flashlight like this to handle a drop of 5 feet but what can I say. I paid 40 bucks for this light each time at lowes and today I bought the xl 50 mag lite for 30.00 It looks good but does not ""feel"" like the Coast. It's lighter and cheaper feeling next to the Coast.I'll see how it does tonight."
1,defective,"Light would not turn on most of the time, I contacted Coast, they said it was defective and to return it which I did. I have other Coast led lights which I highly recommend and I will reorder this one."
1,Piece of junk - Battery doesn't hold a charge,"I was looking for a cheap thermal printer, so I bought this unit.This unit was brand new, but the battery never held its charge. We had to keep it plugged in to work, and the incessant Lo-BAT beeping (which can be turned off in the settings, with much effort), was annoying.I went back to my old printer."
1,Junk,"The cable does not fit a Palm 515, as advertised. Total waste of timeand money, I guess they just sell you junk that doesn't work from some chinese manufacturer and hope that you wont have time to screw around sending back"
4,A must-have reference for any sports writer,"Swan's book is a great reference for any sports writer or editor. Although there are a couple entries that do not agree with the AP stylebook, it generally rehashes and greatly expands upon the things the AP covers. Swan covers obscure sports, punctuation, number usage and spelling among other hard-to-judge areas of writing. If keeping the editor happy and free of hack-jack edits is the goal, this book is a great tool."
3,In retrospect...,"This album is pretty mediocre. I love Barenaked Ladies, and I'm really fond of ""Page One,"" which I bought shortly after it's release. In relation to Page One, this album is easily forgotten. Steve doesn't seem to utilize his voice as much as he is well known for being capable of, the lyrics, while solid, almost blend in with the tunes that seem to lean (in most songs) towards ambient atmosphere. That said, no song is bad, but his newer work is substantially stronger."
4,Gotta let it grow on you,"First of all, this isn't a Barenaked Ladies album. You have to know that when you get it. (Although you probably haven't heard of this if you don't like Barenaked Ladies).The first time through this cd I noticed a few catchy tunes and a few songs that I thought I'd never get to like, but each time I listen to it again I like it more. So, don't give up after the first listen, or you'll be missing some great music.Glitterbug is, in my opinion, the best song on the album. Short, clear and super-sweet, with some beautifully simple music.The fact that this album exists at all makes me wonder what's wrong with these songs that the Barenaked Ladies didn't want to use them, because the feel of most of the music and lyrics is the same. Maybe Stephen Page felt these were more personal somehow, or maybe the rest of the band didn't like them. Whatever the reason, it's worth picking up the cd while we're waiting for another Barenaked Ladies cd to come out."
1,extremely disappointing....,"I first heard about this flick a couple of years ago, and was waiting for it to hit theatres. I almost forgot about it, then was surprised to find it on the Blockbuster shelves a few weeks back....I should have forgotten about this movie!You know there's problems when even the Writers/Stars of the film are telling fans to stay away from this."
5,JOE DIRT + COPS + GROOVE TUBE = HILARIOUS!,"Don't let that mullet fool you because this is one funny movie! The story centers around Ronnie Dobbs who is one ""Crazy Redneck"", but he's really just a Skynyrd lovin' ""good old boy"" trying to stay out of trouble. Although the film has a loose plot, there are several hysterically funny skits with some hilarious cameos from a lot of my favorite funny people!From the opening faux theater announcements to the gut busting ""scene that was removed from the film"" this is a hilarious crack up of a satire! I can't remember when I laughed this hard watching a comedy film! It's short in length, but long on laughs and is a must see film that is sure to have a cult following.CB, Geri, C, Morph, JP and all my A m a z o n buddies, if you haven't seen this yet, see this one today! Too Mucking Fuch!:-D"
3,"Okay, but it could have been great.","I have to agree with those who say this movie could have been better had it been made for Mr. Show fans. It's almost a knock-off of ""Joe Dirt"" the way it is now. But, of course, the bottom line is always measured in who's in control and without Bob and David's control of the project the soul of it was lost. What a shame too. I would still say, if you are a Mr. Show fan you should get the DVD because, hey, it's got some cool funny stuff on it. The few scenes on the DVD that weren't in the movie were funnier than the ones that were and you won't see those without buying it. Here's a clue though.... I got mine for $3.88 at Walmart!Maybe next time they'll do a Mr. Show kind of collection thing and call it ""Coupon, The Movie!"" Now THAT'S a blockbuster just waiting to happen! :D"
4,Frame of Mind,I watched this with a friend on a rainy day and we laughed til we cried. I do not watch the Mr. Show so that may be why I enjoyed it so much. Worth a rental at least...
3,"Yes, Mr. Show Fans Only","I will definitely say that this movie is for Mr.Show fans only, and even if you are a super diehard like me, the movie still is not that great. Many of the segments are straight from the Ronnie Dobbs sketches so we've already laughed at those lines before. However, we do get an updated Ernie with a new ""superpan"" and the return of Three Times One Minus One, and of course it could not be complete without great newscasts. However, it is the type of off the wall humor that MOST LIKELY only true fans will enjoy. There are probably some newbies that will like it, but certainly more that will not. The film goes off on tangents that are funny to us, but unrelated to the plot as a whole, like the Scott Thompson scene. I enjoyed it, but I won't buy it or watch it again unless someone else puts it on."
2,My previous review was from my roomate.,"White trash is a very cliche thing to laugh about these days, meaning at one point it was funny. Not so much anymore though. A mullet can only get you so many laughs these days. Rattails? Now your talking!"
3,It's just OK,"I love Mr. Show, and expected a great movie - but I was disappointed. This is a sketch comedy that should have lasted no more than 15 minutes. There are definately some very funny scenes - including several ""deleted scenes"", but it's not Mr. Show."
3,"I love Mr. Show, but I think I had too high expectations.","I love...love Mr. Show. I subscribed to HBO just for the show when it was still on. I used to laugh so bloody hard to the show. The movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either, like I had been expecting. The deleted scenes were actually some of the funniest in the movie...too bad they didn't keep them in. If you are a huge fan of Mr. Show, then buy this movie, although I want to warn you ahead of time...it isn't as good as the show. Too choppy. Sorry Bob and David, I have to give you 3 stars...but I give you 5 on your show.Rent the movie if you can before you buy it, then figure it out."
4,Mr. Show the Movie (2 viewings required for full hilarity),"Because Mr. Show raised the bar so high for modern sketch comedy, they actually should have probably left this project alone. A movie just isn't the right medium for the scattershot social satire of the series. That being said I love this movie, it is hilarious and very much in the spirit of the program. A couple of scenes could use some editing and tightening but overall it achieves its goal. Bob and David denounce this film on their web site, but come on guys, at least people are finally gonna get a chance to see it. Which pleases every Mr. Show fan I know. Highlights are Terry Twillstein's invention photos, Jack Black's song and dance, Mandy Patikin's broadway song as Ronnie.""Buy now and get this fabulous nickle holder, FREE!, holds once nickle"""
5,This movie rocks,This is a hilarious movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an open mind and broad sense of humor. Not appropriate for kids though...
4,This show Rocks!!,"I saw this at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City. It goes down in history as one of the funniest Sundance films I've ever seen. My friends and I laughed so hard I thought we were going to start crying. I'm counting down the days till it's release. This is not high-brow humor (think Orgazmo and Shakes the Clown), and it's definitely not mainstream - despite what other reviewers are saying. If you have a sense of humor and don't offend easily, THEN DON'T PASS THIS ONE UP!"
5,Thank you,"Love the movie and price! The dvd is near spotless and plays like new plus, the case is in good condition."
1,oops,oops. I guess I didn't see that this item was from the UK and would not play on a standard DVD player. had to return. Big hassle and disappointing!
3,"Entertaining for diehard Mr Show fans, but everyone else will hate it","I was a huge fan of Mr Show before seeing this movie for the first time. Despite my loyalty to the show, I wasn't very impressed with the movie. There are some good laughs, but the movie feels very disjointed and is actually kind of boring at times. Mr Show fans are likely to find the movie mildly entertaining, but I think everyone else will absolutely hate it."
4,Joe Dirt - Only Much Better,"I believe this movie was actually written and filmed before Joe Dirt, but not released in time, as ""thunder"" from this ""genre"" was stolen by more well known, and less funny David Spade. It is a shame, because even though Bob Odenkirk and David Cross have produced much better work than this, it is still miles better than the half-decent Joe Dirt.If you have never heard of Mr. Show with Bob and David, but are in the mood for some semi-intelligent white trash laughs, check this one out. Mr. Show die-hard fans will enjoy the opportunity to see the old cast of characters back together again. If you are a fan of Mr. Show, do not hesitate to buy this DVD."
2,"Fan of Mr. Show, But Not a Fan of This","This film really isn't worth your time. I'm a huge fan of Mr. Show, but I just really didn't care for this movie at all. Making a movie spin-off of a character from Mr. Show was just a horrible idea. It has some funny moments, but it just wasn't that great of a movie. I'd say that instead of wasting your time with this movie, just watch a few episodes of Mr. Show instead."
1,"Avoid this slow, sloppy, generally unfunny mess.","This movie is not good. There are bits and pieces that might entertain, that hint at the potent ""Mr. Show with Bob and David"" voice, but those rare moments are seperated by weak, sluggish film-making. There is absolutely no consistency of tone, or voice. If you're a fan of Bob and David's work, you may ask; how could it not be funny? Well, according to their own website, they ""lost control"" of it. Who cares what their excuse is--follow their advice and wait until a misguided friend buys it, then watch it at their house, then scream at them for wasting your precious time. Or save your money for the Mr. Show season 4 DVD."
3,Silly but funny,"Ronnie looks like a caveman to me. Maybe that is what makes him funny (or at least in this movie). This movie is a spoof of ""reality"" shows. And I guess it's making fun of Southerners (so what else is new?). But it's a gentle ribbing, not mean spirited. I think it kind of gave a one thumb up to the iconoclastic nature of Southerners. If you are in the mood to laugh and not think too hard, you might like this."
5,Run Ronnie Run,"Ths is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.....and everytime I watch it, I catch something different.....I'm slippery, ain't I....Its a must have for everyone who enjoys some dumb comedy......better than Joe Dirt, and thats an all time great...David Cross is hilirious in this movie."
4,"Watch this movie, Watch!","If you like David Cross, or if you like trailer trash as a source of laughs, then this movie is for you. A lot of the jokes parallel Cross' current standup and previous work on Mr. Show. The parody on life in the trailer community and also on the English infomercial types, is hilarious. Enjoy, and don't take life so seriously."
5,this stuffs soooo funny,"ive heard a lot of criticising of this movie saying bad things about it. unheard of! mr show and everyone are so funny i would rate more than five stars but i cant on this. ten at least! i literally wet my pants. i think david cross is the funniest bald man in the movies maybe even tv but here hes ronny and he has hair and hes still funny. okay guys, maybe mullets are a little over done these days! great job!"
5,The Rivers of Zadaa,The Rivers of Zadaa is the sixth installment to the Pendragon series. I loved this book it had adventure and it has mystery in it. This book was the best of the Pendragon it gave me everything that I wanted in a book. This book starts with a tragic death then ends very surprisingly. Saint Dane has gone to the territory of Zadda were he is influencing two warring tribes now Bobby must stop him with the help of the traveler Loor.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes an adventure book that is also a fantasy. This book now had to be the best because you had no idea what was going to happen next. I absolutely loved this book I just never wanted to put it down. I definitely would put this book in my top 5 of favorite books.
3,maybe its just me,"i'm not sure but i read this book over the summer and it was a little bit boring. the story line was pretty good but somehow it didn't get me so interested as the other 5 books. i mean it's not that interesting as i thought it would be. the part that bored me was when ""the group"" was the last 70 pages. i was so bored during that time that i even thought about skipping a few pages to see if it got more interesing. But i didn't and eventually i read the whole thing. thanx to this installment in the series i'm a little bit afraid of trying the next installment. but hey thats just my opinonp.s. if u want to get a good pendragon book buy reality bug; it rocks ur socks!!!!!!!!!!"
5,awesome book,"this book does start off a little slow, but it makes up for it once you get into it about 40 pages. I think in this book bobby pendragon starts developing into the person he is going to be. it even has a very interesting story back on second earth.so over all i think that this is the best book of the series, mainly because it has the best ending of all the books. i mean this really has the best ending. but i cant tell you what it is, your going to have to read it your self.Another part of this book you should look foward to is the part where loor, alder, and sangi start to train bobby to fight. So dont worry about this being a waste of monney, because it is definetly worth 10.17."
5,Great Book,"Great book, you will want to read it over and over. It goes into great depth in explaining Halla and explores some of the powers that travelers have, that's right Saint Dane's not the only one with magical powers!"
1,Repackaged Rip Off - Exactly The Same As Candy Colored Blues,This Is the Same exact DVD As Candy Colored Blues In A Cooler Looking BoxWorst Thing Is Amazon Is Offering It Bundled On There Web Site Buy The Two Same Movies For $36.98. Thanks For The Favor Amazon.
1,rip off,I bought this movie but instead of it titled Rhinocerous it was Candy something blues anyways its a rip off and completely boring donot buy it and do not engage in its false sense of getting paid off the white stripes name because its basically the same info you can find in any one book written about the band and i cant remember if it goes along with the lie of them ( meg and jack) being brother and sister but to relate thats how cheesey it is.
2,Really not THAT bad...,"Just watched this on YouTube - good advice to do the same - under the title 'Candy Colored Blues'. OK It's not BY the White Stripes and contains none of their music, but it's a very low budget TV doc interviewing former Detroit friends and musos. Very little added footage, and a bit of a cavalier attitude to such things as research and spelling !!! But sort of charming, and the interviews are OK and somewhat illuminating.My fave glitch is when the narrator calls the second album 'De Stilge' not once, but twice.All that said, it's as good as most MTV biogs, and for the record totally debunks the brother/sister story, unlike one poster's comment. Did anyone ever believe it?But, sure, don't actually BUY the thing..."
2,Full of mistakes,"I just happened to look through this book for fun when I had some time to kill at a bookstore. I am a native speaker of German and was flabbergasted by the number of errors in this little book-- sometimes several on each page. Each error was one that no native speaker would ever make, just non-sensical stuff, more like the work of a first year student of German who was ""creatively"" playing around with words.The concept itself is kind of nice with the fold-out sheet of important phrases etc., but they really should have used a native speaker to proof read it. At the very least, they could have taken a German dictionary and checked if the words offered as translations are actually German words."
4,Skill but SHRILL,"I ran across this at a show for I think a buck. Never heard them but loved the cover, looked interesting,thought they were a joke. When I first listened I laughed and thought yep their a joke, but I liked it enough to play it a few times. Ive come to realize that there is talent, love the lyric, love the music. I listen to alot of gypsies, (Taraf de Haidouks etc.) but his voice ruins it for me. If they had another singer I would have collected all by them. Too Bad."
5,Great Album,"Agree that it's too bad that not more people know about the Viletones, as they were at the vanguard of punk. The lead singer, though, however much people may have like/d his theatrics, was a right bastard, and ended up breaking up the band with his insane ego."
3,P-ROCK FOR CANADA IN THE 70'S,"NOT ALL MUSIC WAS MEANT TO BE GREAT, AND SO THE CASE HERE. STILL NOT TOO SHABBY FOR THE TIME PERIOD. AVERAGE CONTENT AND SOME OF THE SONGS DRAG ON AND ON TOO MUCH."
5,Good and economical upgrade of a Student Bb Calrinet,My daughter is a seventh grader. She has been using a Yamaha YCL-250 Bb clarinet for three years. I was thinking about buying a better horn for her but she did not want it. She was afraid she would drop the wood clarinet. So I bought this mouthpiece together with a new Rovner ligature. I am glad I did. She can hit some high notes that she was not able to.
4,My classroom,I used this video in my sixth grade classroom as supplimentary material for our mammal tracking unit. It has good environmental vocabulary for easy note taking. Students also see a field biologist at work for a real-life connection between the classroom and career choices.
5,"Exellent compilation of Hooker's biggest hits, and rockinest","This cd is exellent and has more tracks the the wimpy 16, that the other reviewer wants you to buy. This cd is perfectly fine as a sampler of Hooker's finest early 50's sides, included ehre are the hits I'm In The mood(with overdubbed vocals), and a few others. this cd has many more tracks then soem other wimpy 16 track compilations out there, it's a great price, and the sound qaulity is fine. Great value, greta deal, great music. This is soem gruff, and great rockin' jumpin' stompin' blues with attitude. Hooker has got to be one of teh most rhythmic blues guitarists, with a gutsy appealing, mean sounding ""don't mess wit' me"" baritone, smooth as heck!!!"
3,Not the best JLH Collection,"Although this contains a good number of classic tunes, if you are looking for a single-CD John Lee Hooker retrospective you are much better off with Rhino's superb sounding, beautifully selected and wonderfully arranged ""The Very Best of John Lee Hooker""; there are many CDs of the same name but this one is 16 tracks, begins with Boogie Chillen & ends with Terraplane Blues. Good liners too. The collection at hand, Very Best of Boom Boom, is not that good and is missing some essentials."
4,Olympus Charger,"I lost the charger for my Olympus E-410 and bought this charger. It's like the original and it works perfectly. I'm happy with this purchase. I received it later than I expected, but it's OK."
5,Brilliant genealogy,"My great Aunt Dot spent her whole life researching and writing this incredible book. It's filled with genealogy charts, excerpts from ancestors' diaries, clips from news articles, photographs, and hundreds of things that bring ancestors from more than 200 years ago to life. Here is the list of last names from the index with 10+ entries (it's a bit too long for the full index): Allen, Andrews, Baird, Bouttle, Bridenbaker, Buckley, Condon, Cooper, Day, Fitch, Franklin, French, Hale, Harrower, Hubbell, Hutchinson, Janes, Knapp, Marshalek, Osborn(e), Prindle, Raymor, Raymo(u)re, Roles, Sherman, Thompson, Towers, Verdow, Wherry."
3,"Should have been called ""Son of Pumpkinhead""","Pumpkinhead 2 is what you would expect from a horror sequel. Bad story and bad acting. In this one the demon isn't even the real Pumpkinhead,but his son (!?) come back from the dead. Hell, this one doesn't even follow the rules the first one set down. The gore is alright and there are alot of cameos in this movie. The ending even stunk because the real pumpkinhead was bulletproof whil this one isn't. Get the first Pumpkinhead, then pass up this one, unless, like me, you really want to see it"
3,creepy and funny,It's a classic b-movie. It's funny and creepy. Makes a great combination. The storyline is a little shallow but it is still very entertaining. A great buy. The entire Pumpkinhead series will be a good addition to any movie collection.
3,Pumpkinhead doozy,"Pumpkinhead makes a lot of noise and causes a lot of visuals with his stalking power. This story is given a lot of story beneath a story as the creepy demon brought to life is out for two sets of revenge. The first round of boys who've grown to men who condemned him, and those set of young teenagers that brought him back to life, and carelessly destroyed his caretaker in the woods when he was just a deformed boy. There is no major mystery to this tale except for the ones caught up in it, and it's victims The monster is the same as before except for that wonderful eerie soundtrack that made the original a creative classic. It's worth a look see if you are a fan of the Pumpkinhead movie series, but the intended victims, unfortunately, are all heels, especially Danny who I nearly clapped for the monster who actually righted a wrong with this one."
2,Not as great as the first,"This is the straight to video sequel, to the movie that was directed by Stan Winston. While the story itself doesn't have anything to do with the previous movie whatsoever as the story was fit to do with Pumpkinhead. Although that what was done with the first movie such as where Pumpkinhead is buried at isn't the same location where he was in the first movie let alone that old woman Haggis isn't the one that can bring Pumpkinhead into the world. For the most part, the writing for this movie could've been better to me especially if it's meant for a TV movie. Although the part that I don't get is that Pumpkinhead is either the boy or the father, that is one part that has me confused throughout the movie, but the rest of the movie isn't so bad, though overall it could've been better. Overall I give the movie 2 stars out of 5."
4,What you would expect...,"I saw this movie years ago. It's just what you're looking for in a Movie Night Campy Thriller...lots of build up, average acting and great monster scenes. I personally enjoy this movie more than it's predacessor Pumkinhead. Enjoy this!"
3,Pumpkinhead 2,"This movie was not as good as the first, but it was decent for what it's worth.The actors did a good job, & the storyline was good. The movie would have been better if the director had more time to create the movie, as he explained that he only had a few months to complete the movie. Overall, I do recommend this movie to any hardcore horror fan out there."
1,Bloody Awful!,"What can I say about this movie...Don't do it people, just don't do it.Buy it that is. If you have to see it, borrow it if a friend has it, but don't pay good money for it. The first Pumpkinhead was I believe a good story, not great, but enjoyable nonetheless. This, this was just...Words fail me. Need I say more!"
3,its ok,well the first one was better than this one and everything it was ok but i should have done something with the first one like continue the story not start a whole new one with the retarded kid who is pumpkinghead but it is a good story line for a starter movie not a sequel.
1,O.K. But Not Pumpkinhead,This film lacks all the nessesary sequel reqierments. First of all the original is not even mentioned. Pumpkinhead should have been the one Ed Harley turned into in the first one. The movie wasn't even made by MGM Studios. It just isn't worthy of the Pumpkinhead name.
1,"Don't Even Bother,......","The original ""Pumpkinhead"" was a brilliant movie. This sequel is an insult to the original. The backwoods setting is moved to what looks like the suburbs and the kids all know where the withc lives!! Even in the original Ed Harley had to get help finding her. The plot is juvenile and the effects are nowhere near as creepy as the original. Don't even bother with this one, just watch the original again."
4,GOOD STUFF!,This is not a bad movie at all. Pretty good story to it. Got some descent scares and good acting. I thought it was put together well and is worth checking out.
1,"Hopeless, typical sequel","A completely different plot from the first, no good scares or killings, and no connection to the original ""Pumpkinhead"". Even the special effects are worse than the first. Don't bother watching it, there are much better things to waste your money on."
3,Better Sequel,"This is the rare sequel better than the original. It got rid of anything supernatural from the original Pumpkinhead. It wasn't s cary. The scenes with the title monster were like the Alien movies. They should make DVD discs out of hard plastic and put the techknology inside a plastic shell so they don't scratch or skip and it reads it that way. I didn't cry at the end of this he was Amish blah because in the BC era they didn't want people to feel bad for them and no one was homeless. Pilgrim Lutheran church is about this old lady who was homeless. It's not bad, not a classic either. I would watch it again."
3,"3.5 stars, from a horror movie buff","its not very often that a sequel surpasses its original, and this movie is no exception, but its a very decent follow up to a classic, i highly recommend it for its creative killings and a pretty cool back story"
3,Acceptable sequel,"Although it lacks the edge of the first, Pumpkinhead 2 is still well done when compared to other horror flicks. Not as good as it's predessor, but it offers enough to keep watchers interested."
3,Nice movie. Bad plot.,"This was a great sequel to the first film. But, they tried to change the idae that the witch had set in the first film. There were also to many different styles of script in it. Horror,Drama, and I dont know where to group it but something along the line of stupid father-save-daughter-from-monster-that-wont-stop-trying-to-kill-her type thing. If you see it you will understand. All-in-all not a bad movie."
2,predictable isn't even the word...,"As much as I love Andrew Robinson, this movie doesn't even live up to the standards of your average sequel, which is by definition inferior. His acting is flawless as usual, unfortunately his character, and everyone elses charactor, is dull and predictable."
1,Sucks,"Somebody needs to make a real Pumpkinhead 2. This does not qualify as the sequel to Pumpkinhead. Next time your at the video store, and you see this movie, get Barney and Friends instead. It's a much better movie. Plus Barney is scarier then Pumpkinhead 2."
1,NOT knifeless,"I purchased one of these (from ReStockIt) with the hope that a knifeless tool would be more travel friendly. What they shipped had a knife blade.Contacting them, they promised to send the proper item, stated that it was already on it's way to me and that they would e-mail me a return label. Several days later, they did send the return label but also said that they were not going to send the proper replacement and would offer me a refund instead. There was no apology, only a strict list of steps to follow with a timeline for the return to be credited back to me. I also received a couple of additional e-mails from them that showed how poor their customer service, follow-up and business sense skills are. Sadly, they are not Amazon quality.I come from this experience having learned two things:1) This is NOT a knifeless Fuze2) At all costs, avoid ReStockIt. Their further e-mails only served to punctuate that point."
4,Great book on training,"This book is based on mostly training for competition, and some for self-defense. It shows one form(tae geuk 1) but that wasn't the intended purpose of it. It shows falling and rolling, stances, arm strikes, kicks, blocks, and even things like stepping. It also has good sections on conditioning and competition. The conditioning section has plyometric training, various ab workouts, kick and hand strike resistance training, and a very good sectiong on mental toughness(various imagery, meditation, and focused breathing exercises). The bad side is mostly a small lack of information. I felt the kicking and stretching sections could have been better. The kicking section doesn't show any jumping and advanced kicks(like the spinning hook kick), but overall it is a good book. It also has a nice price too."
5,Bratz Play Sportz Roxxi,"Hi! I have this Fabulous Roxxi!This Roxxi well, really rocks! best yet!verrrrrry durable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buy This Roxxi!Thank you for taking your time to read my review!"
4,Too Cute to Kick Butt,"I haven't been a big fan of these newer, affordably priced Bratz since it's my feeling you get what you pay for. I originally stayed away from the Sportz line of Bratz since they all look cheap (as in quality) and don't come with any extras (except a gym bag). I picked up Roxxi since she's one of my favorites, but I'm disappointed with her. For the ""lil' devil"" of the Bratz girls, I don't like the fact she looks ""angelic"" in her absolutely non-traditional martial arts outfit (what happened to authenticity?) with purple eyes and softer facial makeup (I rather like the style of the original Roxxi as well as the Rock Angelz version with the edgier makeup and the kick-butt attitude of the doll.) Overall, Roxxi is cute, but she gets 4 stars for lack of authenticity (even Meygan's bowling outfit is more suited to the sport!) and failure of her designers in keeping with Roxxi's edgier look!"
4,Greatest Testament,"Critic Roger Kimball called Delacroix's Journal ""perhaps the greatest literary testament any painter has left."" See Roger Kimball, ""Delacroix Reconsidered,"" The New Criterion, Sept. 1998, p. 10."
4,Excellent concise overview of the period.,"_The Age of Charlemagne_ offers an excellent concise overview of the political and military history of the Carolingian Empire. David Nicolle, perhaps Osprey's top author on medieval subjects, gives the usual Osprey coverage of the military development and organization of the era, in this case the gradual introduction of stirrups to western Europe and the rise of early fighting cavalry. However, perhaps due to the paucity of historical material on these topics, Nicolle also includes a brief but thorough history of the Empire itself. The factors cited for its fall in the early 900s CE include encroachment by Saracens and Magyars, raids by Vikings, and the inability of the offense-designed Carolingian military system to adapt to a defensive role. _The Age of Charlemagne_ details the military history of this early medieval period and provides a valuable overview of the political history as well."
5,Alfi Albergo Carafe,Wonderful product and excellantly priced. You can count on Amazonto have the best prices.
4,Yes the sound quality sucks,"But that's not why we listen to Iggy now, is it? The energy from this show you can feel. Especialy when Iggy tries to break up a fight (""Take Care of Me"") - you can just feel the sweat condensation on the walls, feel the angst and raw power that makes up an Iggy live show. I only wish they had recorded it better. Otherwise, a kick ass show."
2,Bad Sound Quality,"I am a huge Iggy fan. I own all official Iggy / Stooges albums and many ""unofficial"" or bootleg releases. The sound quality on this CD is poor. The sound is muffled throughout and you can hear the ""tape hiss"" during quiet sections. However the show itself is really good. I recommend this for Iggy completists and for its historical value of a recording with Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols) and Brian James (The Damned)."
2,$475??!,"$475 is an insane price for this drive (PATA). Compare this price to a currently available 2.5"" SATA drive and see why. I believe they no longer manufacture 7200 RPM 2.5"" PATA drives which is the only explanation for the price. If you need this older style drive, you are better off putting that $$$ to a new computer!"
5,Fantastic CDRw drive!,"What a great drive! I still can't believe how fast I can create my own music CD's. Right out of the box it performed without any glitches. I have read alot of opinions/comments from alot of people, so I knew that HP was the way to go. Don't waste time with so called bargain drives. Get this one it's the best!"
4,"Good writer, but...","This is a very good writer, fast and efficient. I believe it iswell worth the money. There is only one draw-back though, the Adapteccdr software absolutely s**ks. It takes off a second from the beginning and end of every song when recording audio. That means a second generation cdr looses 4 seconds per track. You can record disc-at-once, no gaps, but it still removes part of the song. It also doesn't have the option to record the 80min/700M cdr's. I am currently looking into new software, but it's one helluva writer."
3,You get what you pay for,"Great product. Although this drive does not like Ultra-DMA, it does write and re-write with excellent quality. A must have."
5,Second Generation,"If you have been lookig for a break from standard fiction, you'll want to read Beth Anderson's, Second Generation. From dangerous South American jungles to the world of politics and even murder, you'll feel the roller coaster thrill of excitment, fear, intrigue and of course, love. Of all of Ms. Anderson's books, I believe this is my all time favorite!Read Second Generation for a refreshing change in today's fiction."
1,better forgotten,"Hilda Doolittle in my view was a great poet, if a minor American poet, but one that deserves a wide reading audience. Ethereal. Her prose works, novels, memoirs, and stories are very uneven and some are far better forgotten. For example, some of the post-live writings of Hemingway published to make money for Hemingway's family and his publisher would have been far better not published because fragments, unfinished, or in some cases mere exercises for what he wanted to publish. So it is with H.D.I have not yet read his disguised fictional memoirs so I cannot asses them, ... yet. But these stories simply do not add to H.D.'s stature even if they do shed a little, too little, light on her as a writer."
1,Don't buy HP tape drives,"I've had one of these for a while now. It's broken 2 tapes. It regularly fails to complete a backup due to errors. The backup software is not compatible with Windows ME and to use 98 they recommended I pay another $30 for an upgrade. It you plan on keeping data backed-up for a while, I wouldn't use HPs.Of course I have a used one for sale, if you're looking for one."
1,HP's software policy sucks,"I bought HP's 8GB tape drive about 20 months ago. At the time it shipped with only a Windows 95 version of the backup program. When the Windows 98 version became available 3 months later, I was informed that it would cost another $35 to get a ""new"" version of the software. The title for this review says it all."
1,Canceled Order,"After reading all the reviews for sony camrecorders, we have selected this product with my fiance which we will used it in our honeymoon coming in 2 weeks time. Although It was on-stock and after ordering sucessfully, I have received an email just saying that my order has been canceled, without explaining the reason. So I wrote to customer's service and they replied me that the seller of this product ""was temporarily unable to accept payment through Amazon web site. (This can happen for a variety of reasons.)"" They are sorry for inconvience and hope to see me again soon! I have appreciated amazon all the time and recently (just before receiving cancelation email) ordered an ipod for my cousin as well. But now I am not sure if you can see me EVER again."
3,Costs to much,This is a good ramen soup. Unfortunately you have to buy a years supply. Stick with your grocery store and just buy what you need.
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered these rotors for my daughter's 2004 Toyota Corolla. Within 4 months and less than 6000 miles, the rotors were warped. I wrote to Centric to ask about a warranty return, but they did not have the decency to respond.The OEM rotors lasted about 100,000 miles. Centric claimed their rotors were better. Don't waste your money on the Centric rotors - buy OEM replacements when you need them."
2,Didn't Last,"I am disappointed because I expected more from these Centric rotors. They developed a mild warp about a year into service on my 2003 Corolla. I am careful not to run through standing water and have been easy on them. The Centric name once stood for quality, but I can no longer recommend them. The E-Coating looks good but is worthless if the rotors warp in no time."
5,Complete Pageturner,"I have never read such a compelling book before. The author truly places you in Blue's life...and keeps you wondering where he really is and how it all happened. I could not figure out the exact details during the book, and the end was shocking. It made me want to read more, and it was a cliffhanger that made me think there was more. I hope that the author writes a sequel in the same manner she did this one. This book is a must read!!!"
4,Blue eyes never looked so sinister.......,"Kimberly Rangel's second work is truely a masterpeice, this book delves into the mind of a serial killer - combining a thriller theme with a trace of the supernatural. The Homecoming is a great read for those of you who, like me, are bored with the same old genre plots. This one covers all the ground without being predictable and winds up to one hell of an ending. Walk on the darkside with Samuel Blue or fret over the safety of ""sweet Darby"" whatever your into - this'll keep you coming back for more."
3,NOT 11X14 - IS 11X17,"This is not an 11x14 picture. It is 11x17. I already had a frame purchased for an 11x14 picture, and now have to return it and buy something that will fit this picture as it is not worth returning....Arrived in good condition, and looks nice, just disappointing."
4,"Solid Album, Despite Low Recording Quality","A great live set from the Count Basie Orchestra recorded in from Nice, France during the summer of 1977 on the same tour that produced ""Live at Montreaux 1977."" Check out Clark Terry as the guest soloist on ""Basie."" The recording levels are off -- John Duke's bass is a little hot, though it is nice to be able to hear him better than on other albums. Nevertheless, it's well worth the low price (like other Laserlight albums, it's cheaper than most others)."
5,exactly,"This product is perfect for general printing needs and gives a professional look to our office printing. It is hard to find soft gloss, rather than the glossy finish."
5,NYC UNDERGROUND MADNESS !,"This was one of the biggest underground tribal club hits in NYC in 2002. Peter Rauhofer, Victor Calderone and Manny Lehman, just to name a few, featured this track prominently inn their sets. A must have for all tribalists with a flair for the dramatic."
1,Poor screenplay,The dialogue and the direction does not present the book and the author in a way that justifies this screenplay.
2,Fell apart,I had this product on an Exo Terra cage for several months. It worked great to keep my toddler out of the cage. One day it just fall apart scattering its innards all around. Disappointed in the quality of the construction.
5,my ball python cant get out,i like it it looks nice with my terra set up and the locking mechanism is a 3 digit code i leave it on the preset code of 000 because i have no kids in the house and my snake cant get out anyway with the way the terrarium locks but it does look nice
3,WRONG REVIEWS FOR IRISH CRYSTAL,"Amazon is listing the wrong publish date and reader reviews for IRISH CRYSTAL by Andrew Greeley. The reviews here are for IRISH TIGER.IRISH CRYSTAL is the 9th book in the Nuala & Dermot Michael series, was first published in 2006, and is about modern day couple John & Estelle Curran, who are threatened with a car bombing and the historical saga of Robert Emmet."
4,The Hatching Of Majin Buu Commenses,"This dvd contains 3 episodes:Episode 217:Buu Is Hatched:While Goku and Majin Vegeta continue their dark and intense battle, Majin Buu`s cocoon is broken ,and out comes....nothing. But a new form is in the clouds, and it is ready to eliminate!Episode 218:The Losses Begin:Majin Buu has finnaly been summoned again, as a fat pink blob. Does he really have the strength, as the Supreme Kai claims he does?In the meanwhile, Goku falls victim to Majin Vegeta`s sinister trick, and is finnaly defeated! Now the Sayin Prince has a new mission:Destroying Majin Buu!Episode 219:The Terror Of Mr.Buu:As Majin Vegeta heads towards the sinister villian known as Majin Buu,Goten and Trunks arrive, and breaks Piccolo`s statue!In the meanwhile, Buu attacks Dabaura, and eliminates him. And the next victim:Gohan!And then the last one to confront Majin Buu:The Supreme Kai!Can they Kai defeat the sinister nightmare,or will he be crushed like Gohan and Dabuara?"
2,slightly dissapointed,"I am quite disappointed with this product because it doesn't do what I expected. I brought this for my seven year old son because he loves to learn about different places. I thought the globe would help him learn by pointing to a place and telling him about it. Instead, it just plays a game asking questions. Yes, he can learn by this type of interaction, but that is not what I wanted from this product. I thought I had search the internet enough and had found what I wanted for him, I didn't. In my opionion, it would be a great institutional learning aide for a classroom environment. Perhaps for an older child this would be a more useful learning product."
4,Purchase for granddaughter,Granddaughter wanted a globe for 7th birthday.A talking globe was extra special.It's fun and educational.Too early to judge durability.
3,Exclusion Unacceptable in A Movement of Inclusion,"I picked up the book at a thrift store several years ago and perused it. I recently picked it up again and read through completely. It was exhilirating and truly life-changing to read about issues that I was experiencing, had experienced, or - by the looks of things - will be experiencing.However, I am profoundly disappointed at the exclusion of issues pertaining to men of color. Admittedly, I am in possession of the second edition, and Baumli excused this lack of representation with the absence of material published by and about men of color. This is not true - even in 1985 - and is completely unacceptable. There have been several volumes, especially anthologies, devoted to men of color. I'm ordering the recent edition for myself and a friend as we prepare to collaborate on a writing project, and am hoping to find ""us"" between the front and back cover."
3,Story of Sonoma,"From the side of the DJ: The story of Sonoma, the story of the Valley of the Moon and its people is fascinating and romantic history. From the days of the Indians and Padres to Jack London's day, it is replete with colorful incidents. The story of the young Californian, Mariano Vallejo and his vast ranchos; his arrest by the Bear Flag Makers; the coming of the gallant American officers and soldiers who wooed the senoritas and much, much more. A history of the Sonoma area written in 1937. Enjoy!"
3,Not compatible with OS X,"This product sounds cool, but don't believe the statement that is can be used with OS X. The Palm Desktop software supports OS X. The TomTom GPS navigation software, however, requires Windows.There is no way to know this from the outside of the box!"
5,Good product,"I was initially skeptical about the ""eye-ease"" claims about the paper color, but after using this notebook for a few days I have to say the lack of gloss/light refraction becomes quite comfortable after you become accustomed to it. Cheap binder/looseleaf paper can be shiny and glossy, which strains your eyes whether you notice it or not over a period of time. The pages of this notebook are a dark, greenish yellow color that do not have this problem.The notebook itself is sturdy, dependable and easy to use.Five stars, no complaints, and I would purchase this notebook again."
5,Slim Sculpt-Ellen Barrett,"I would highly recommend this work-out. It is fun, beneficial. I never thought I would stick to an exercise plan and this one is something I look forward to. In just a short time, I feel more flexible, I am able to stand and sit straighter (I have fairly-significant curvature of the spine) and my hip pain from the malalignment is greatly reduced to almost non-existent at times. I can only imagine the benefits this program would have for those with ""normal"" spines. Ellen is so pleasant. She is like having your most non-judgemental best friend right in your living room, encouraging you to be the best you can be. Her stated goal is to inspire and she certainly does in my opinion."
2,"It Makes My Shoulders Hurt, and Not in a Good Way","I really dislike this video. For one thing, there is basically no cardiac effect. It is much too easy for that. But the more important thing is that it makes my shoulders and neck hurt. They don't feel worked out, they just hurt. I did this video one day, and the next day I didKathy Smith: Lift Weights to Lose Weight, and I felt really worked out and with no shoulder pain. This is the second Studio workout I've bought from Ellen Barrett and I didn't like the other one either. I like her old Crunch videos, but the Studio thing just isn't working for me. Also, on another issue, the music on this dvd is not motivating."
2,TOO MUCH ARMS & HARDLY ANY LEG WORK,"I was a disapointed in this dvd. The first three sections worked mainly the arms non-stop, and only last section ""matwork"" had any leg work at all. I felt it was quite an un-even workout."
5,Love this DVD,"Another great Ellen Barrett DVD. She's so easy to follow, easy to listen to, and an awesome combination of friendly and peppy without being annoying. This is a great DVD. The addition of the weights works my arms well."
4,excellent,"Even though FM radio had the newer and edgier forms of music in 1968, AM was still a rich and musically diverse beast. Hearing the tracks on AM Gold 1968 reminds you how much invention was going on, even in the singles format.You get the blue-eyed soul of The Rascals ""Beautiful Morning,"" the amazing pop constructions of Spanky And Our Gang's ""Like To Get To Know You,"" and the suburb melodic jazz as top forty of ""Grazin' In The Grass,"" by Hugh Masakela.It is fascinating how well made, how much care went into so much of this work, coming from an almost infinite number of musical sources. You do get the occasional track that completely dates-""Honey"" by Bobby Goldsboro would get no attention in the modern world- but the vast majority of this material hold up incredibly well."
5,Excellent choice,"At first, I was a little skeptical about an overlay as opposed to an actual full air mattress but this has worked out perfectly. the overlay is easily five inches thick, constantly refilling and maintaing air, quietly and effectively. An excellent and reasonable choice."
5,Goku vs. Vegeta...A Saiyan Duel,My most favorite episode Goku vs. Vegeta...A Saiyan Duel is in here contains the famous scene of the clash between Goku's Kamehameha and Vegeta's Galick Gun!!! Buying this DVD is worth it for any DBZ fan.
5,Vegeta RULES!,"This episode is so cool! VEGETA & GOKU BATTLE! ON EARTH! not on namek! the ginyu come to namek!(see my review on namek,the ginyu force one!)Vegeta gets hit with the spirit bomb!BYE! byenowbyenowbyenowbyenow!"
4,Then it hit me &#65533; he is dead!,"Lately I havent paid much attention to American Poetry. Provincial minds who spill their prosy guts over America's kitchen sink or worse and who belong into one of Ophra's spirituality binges. So it completely slipped me by, that the US had a Russian as poet laureate; the name was not familiar. Then I found his collected poems. Critics point to howlers in the translation, especially if committed by the author himself: it is true, there is space for improvement. But to blame it on the justified demand that translations of poetry have to be faithful to content and structure, rather points to inhibitions in the critics judgement. As for me: I found at long last another poet of stature and rank. And yes he deserves a better presentation. (It can be done!) I became interested in his biography - born 1940 ... and then it hit me: he is already dead. And I felt sad, as if I had missed the arrival of a long lost relative."
4,Customers are the gold in your company,"I liked this book. All companies depend on one thing only; customers. And ""1001 Ways to Keep Customers Coming Back"" empasizes this point which, although, should be clear with all managers and business owners, is not. The book introduces basic ways of keeping your customers happy and how to ""promote"" you company or product so that you gain customer loyalty. I think this is a good book for everyone in the business world."
4,Eye-catcher sparks student interest!,"This book was one of about 20 or so books I used in my classroom for a self-guided and self-paced unit on oceanography. It was one of the most-used books in my selection - students were quickly absorbed by the beautiful illustrations, and used it not only for their research, but were also seen choosing it for independent choice reading. The book was useful in sparking interest in marine biology, and gave a basic understanding of the content addressed. It was useful as a starting point for further research, but did not give the detail their research required. In all, I would recommend this book as a lovely and colorful introduction to oceanography."
1,I would have bought it . . .,"I love the show and would have bought it if there was a DVD option. If there is, I can't find it. I've got nothing against VOD - it's very cool - but not providing a DVD option is crazy for those of us who don't want to watch a video on our computer. I would have bought it. I guess I'll buy something else."
4,Great introduction to early 20th certury sociologists,"Arthur Asa Berger is a great lecturer -- he was able to clearly present the central ideas of several sociologists in a book of mere 150 pages. The pretext for all the lectures was an interview of these sociologists by Sherlock Holmes who was investigating the theft of a diamond from a certain Lady Bracknell during a dinner party where these sociologists all attended. The story itself is far from thrilling as a real Sherlock Holmes story would have been, and no one would expect thrills from a semi-textbook anyway. Nevertheless, the story is intriguing enough to retain the readers' attention throughout all these social theory laded monologues and conversations.I would recommend the book to anyone who is interested in learning somethig about these well known sociologists or social theorists: Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, W.E.B. Du Bois, Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Sigmund Freud."
1,Completely age-inappropriate,"Who ever thought this was an age-appropriate doll for GIRLS??? Leather, zippers, and thigh high boots? Please???!!! I cannot believe that anyone would allow their daughters to play with this doll. It looks like a better name for the toy is ""S&M Bratz"" - all it's missing is a whip."
4,fun...but nasty,this doll is very pretty but her outfit is horrible it looks like a hoochie mama i do have the doll but i took the clothes off immediately!!
3,Good but not as good as I thought.,"I love the bra, but it did not last long. I don't know if I bought the wrong size (even though I follow the measurements guide on the site to the 't'), but the underwire eventually tore out of the under side of the bra and has stabbing me ever since. I started to get bruises. Probably my girls are too big but I thought it would have stand up a bit longer. It was quite confortable."
2,they dont fit well,it is a really nice bra and it feels good it your hands but when i wore them my boobs are constantly slipping out or popping right out. I am in public and i always have to fixing my boobs in them.
3,It fits weird.,"The price is great, but the cut is weird on it. It's not true to size. I still wear it and it's very pretty, but I it could be cut better."
3,Great Bra for the Money,"This is a great bra for the money... but not as comfortable as the Maidenform Tshirt bra, but did keep it."
2,Not comfortable,"This bra is weird. It rides up from the bottom leaving her breast squished. Not what I thought when I bought it. I don't return lingerie, but will not be wearing this bra again."
1,AIA & Friends - Live at Hemingways,"Good old JB!!!!. Instrumental bakup not as good as today, with all the current JB musician's. Especially, Michael Utley"
1,Wasted money,"Previously a library reference book. All, and I mean every, pop up is broken. Misled as to the condition of the book. Waste of money and time. Very unsatisfied!!"
2,surprised,"I hesitated buying this book since I had not personally read it and intended to give it as a birthday gift to a friend who loves the beach, but there were such great reviews that against my better judgment I purchased it and we gave it to him.He randomly opened the book and it was talking about going nude at the beach as one of the activities. He questioned us about it and of course we were embarrassed. We are Christians who desire to live for the Lord and wish we never bought this book because we certainly would never advocate that. That was just one page. I was afraid to look and see what the others contained. It doesn't matter, we apologized and will definitely learn from that lesson."
4,"CLASSICS, BUT TOO FAMILIAR?","To my mind this bargain-priced CD concentrates rather too much on the familiar, and favours white bands over others by a ratio of four to one. That seems something of a wasted opportunity, but if it's just what you're looking for you won't be disappointed."
5,"it is a completely realistic, and down-to-earth book.","It is fascinating and at the same time realistic. It portrays the real dominican family, and it also shows that any family has its ups and downs. Perez is an extremely talented writer!!!"
1,too gruesome,"This is one book that I will not read. It is too gruesome or true to life. The family life depicted is very sad. Though they try to do good, life is too rough and they get trammeled."
5,It explores relationship of one daughter to her family.,"It explores relationship of one daughter to her family. Iliana has gone away to school only to feel responsible for the problem facing her family back home in New York. She quits school to go back to her family and she realizes that some of the problems can not be so easily overcomed. Her father is one of the few male characters in the recent past to be a strong family man and not the typically portrayed latin macho that has no interest in their own family. It is a very fresh view at mental illness, family togetherness, and the need to be your own person."
3,Old book,This book was old and ok but kinda boring. I thought that the dude was pretty cool and knows his stuff. I probably wouldn't have been able to do that.
3,A valuable reference.,"A thorough, and unbiased inquiry, commissioned by congress, of the importance of cryptography to the information economy. Still highly useful, despite being increasingly dated."
4,Book Lovers Laugh at Yourself,"This is an amusing look at writers with blocks, finicky readers, moody editors, and a wry sideways glance at promotional stunts and desktop publishing. While it's not sidesplitting funny, it certainly is an amusing little collection around its theme and good for more than a chuckle or two. If you are in the writing or publishing business you'll recognize all the characters and situations and it will be a lot funnier for you than for most."
4,DAM!!,"EC.ILLA IS DOING IT!!THE ALBUM TO GET IF YOUR TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT BLING,AND MONEYAND IM SO ICEY!? ""THE WACKEST OF ALL ARTIST""!! YOU WILL BEBUMBIN' THIS CD FOR A LONG TIME!! TRUST ME!"
2,Not impressed,"I thought this product would be great for the floating trips I take during the summer. Although it does work to hold a case of beer, there is little room left for ice and what ice their is gets melted due to the transparent nature of the cooler. Actually, I wouldn't even call it a cooler. It is more like a little green house."
2,The cooler they sent me looks differently than this one I ordered!,"The one I received is the same concept and function, but is a solid white with some blue lettering on it, not this cute looking clear plastic with blue and pink lettering, so that was disappointing, and I'm not going to go to the trouble to send back an item like this, so beware, they may not send you exactly the product you think you are ordering!"
3,Okay item,"I bought two different floating coolers for a canoe trip, this being one of the items. I was not overally impressed with its ability to keep ice and also the lid didn't stay closed. This would probably be great for a home pool that you can easily refill ice in, I will not purchase again."
4,Summer fun,This product doesn't hold a case of anything with ice!!...I would say it probably holds app. 15 cans with ice comfortably...Its not so much of a cooler as the ice does melt very rapidly butif you plan on consuming your beverages in a somewhat fast fashion thenthis product works great!!...I am very happy with my purchase
3,WRONG COLOR,Intex Mega Chill Floating Ice Chest (58820E) [Toy]I USE THIS TO PUT MY IPOD/DOCKING STATION IN AND FLOAT AROUND WITH SO I PREFER TO HAVE A CLEAR ONE AND THIS ONE IS WHITE. IT ALSO DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AS DURABLE.
3,Fun little camera,"It's hard to rate a camera like this. It is a fun little toy camera, but limited in its uses. They probably should have space the time between pictures out a bit, because its shutter is not fast enough to stop a lot of action.If you are not insistant on the Lomo name and bright colors, you can get a very similar camera for less money..."
1,Badly made rubbish,"When I bought one of these I knew that it was a plastic toy type camera, but I was suprised at exactley how plasticy and cheap it was, especially for its not cheap price.I tried one roll of film in it - the results were so bad, the lab didn't bother printing it and just gave me the negs and a contact print; the last lens in sequence jammed open and the film transport was so terrible that everything overlapped resulting in mostly nothing on the negatives. I took it back to where I got it for a full refund.Yes I expected blur, I expected vignetting, I expected suprises. What I did not expect was such terrible build quality and results.This camera is a nice idea, if they were actually made well, it would be great - but it is mass produced plastic junk. Buying one is a lottery - you may be lucky, you might not. I'm sad to say, don't waste your money."
3,Almost but not quite...,"Ordered this Versa Top and I'm not certain I got the one I ordered, as the one I received doesn't reach the back of my tank. Its between a half an inch to an inch short. Thus, it doesn't seal the top like its meant to, without some creative adaptation. Disappointing. Not a satisfying purchase."
2,Far to simplistic an approach to contracting,"Although this book is the most readily available book containing standard boiler-plate contracts, most of the forms just do not have what it takes. In today's litigious climate it is necessary to spell out every detail, possible eventuality, and its remedy in a construction contract. If that is what you are looking for then don't buy this one. These contracts are about as simplistic and remedial as something that you would come up with yourself after about thirty seconds thought, and that's it. If you want a good, thorough exhaustive contract (like I do) keep looking. Sorry Craig and Karen, but look at a real estate contract used by your local board of realtors. That is what you need to strive for in your contracts; all of the lawsuits against contractors attest to it."
2,NOT FOR THE HOMEOWNER,I purchased this book to help build my house. I am the general contactor for the job and I thought I would be able to find some form for the sub contractors to sign. This was not the case and it really wasn't any help to me at all. It might help someone who is starting their own business but not for someone building their own house.
1,To Basic To Run A Construction Bussiness!!!!,"I bought this book and CD, To do a $700,000.00 Building Contract. What a joke! I wouldn't do a $5,000.00 contract with this book. It's way to basic to protect anyone."
5,Great book for biginners,I'm new in this business and this book help me to make construction forms and contract so easy.
1,Parrots for dummies,This book was too basic to be useful. It did not have the information I needed to train my bird. I am a novice and yet found no new information in the book. I am annoyed that I bought it.
3,"I like the pictures, everthing else is okay.","It's definitely a beginner parrot owner's book but for someone that wants to learn more about parrots than just the basics, than this book (along with every other parrot) should not be the only book you purchase or use as a reference. There will always be new information discovered."
5,great info,This book has alot of great info and wonderful recipes that finally got my adopted eclectus to eat the foods vital to his good health!
5,Parrots for Dummies,Worth reading before considering the acquisition of a bird. Gives good insight into what to expect from different types of birds and the responsibilities associated with avian guardianship.
5,Great All Around Book for Every Level of Owner,I am really impressed with this book. As the new mom of a Blue & Gold Macaw I have been reading everyting I can get my hands on. By far this is the most generally informative book that covers all aspects of parrot ownership. I would certainly recommend this as the first book you buy for your collection
3,"""OK"" - but not really clear. Good for general overview only.","Ordered this for the purpose of repairing the latch myself for one of the rear vertical doors on my Excursion. ""Of course"" the side door latches were somewhat covered in the manual but no such luck on the rear doors. This manual is somewhat like an adjustable wrench - works ""ok"" on some things but not the best at any particular thing.If you are looking for a (very) general guide for maintenance issues on your vehicle, this may prove somewhat useful. It will never win any awards for clarity and conciseness, however. For the money, it's (just) ""OK""."
5,A Simple Heart is Simply Wonderful!,"A Simple Heart is a wonderful book, full of the deep significance of the everyday which so symbolizes the writing of Flaubert. The parrot which figures so prominantly in the story is an unusual image that is well-developed and well-used by Flaubert in this all-to-little known novella. The characters are shockingly well-developed for the a book of so few pages, resulting in a book that is deeply moving. Also, in keeping with his traditional style, Flaubert's descriptions of the physical world in the story are fantastic and piercing. A Simple Heart stays with the reader long after the last page is read. For fans of Madame Bovary, this is a book not to be missed!"
3,A little bit of everything with Little Freddie King,"From funky electric instrumentals to spare acoustic blues with harmonica, this album spans the genre.Little Freddie King is a competent guitarist in his own right, but his style and sound are very different from his namesake, Freddie King.Although Track 5 is a cover of Freddie King's instrumental ""San Ho Zay,"" it is one on the low points of the album, as it is marred by a very ""un B-3"" sounding synthesthesizer.Yet overall, the album is a good listen. Highlights include the Jimmy Reed flavored ""I Used to Be Down"" and Little Freddie's original ""I'm Gonna Haul Right Off and Cry.""Three out of five for this one."
5,One of the best linguistics books I own,"I'm a bit biased, since my mother is Canadian and we have Cree blood, but overall this book is one of the best linguistics books I've read in a long time. The book gives the history of the ""impossible language"" (as quoted from the book) that formed from French and aboriginal Canadian languages. The book isn't written only for expert linguists, so anyone can understand the book. Some parts may be difficult for beginners, but those problems are easily solved.For anyone interested in learning about a language that most of the world doesn't understand, this book is a gem. It won't teach you the language, but it will definitely help you respect and love what might be an ancestral language for you."
4,Informative,A long winded with the history of the paleo pioneers but extremely well done. I enjoyed it.
5,Wow!!,"Mr. Everhart provides first-hand insight and fabulous references that will accurately inform and entertain any science enthusiast or educator! His book is THE authoritative reference for the Cretaceous-era marine event in the American hemisphere, and it is invaluable to me for my field work collecting fossils."
2,long hard slog,"I did finally get to the end of this book, but it was just out of stubborness. Not worth the effort. A book review of about 10 pages would have been a better way to learn a little about this subject,"
4,Detailed enough but approachable,"The ""Oceans of Kansas"" has turned out be that rare item, something that accurately lives up to it's advertisement. I found the book to be detailed enough to keep my interest but at the same time not a scientific journal. If you like the website, you will enjoy this book. Good job Michael Everhart but you should have used Raul Martin to provide the art work!"
3,"Alright,","I think there are a lot of good resources you can refer. In addition, there are 6 multiple-choice exams that you can do. However, the multiple choice seems extremely hard compared to what I have done and some questions do not have specific explanation.......... I would not regret buying the book, but I wish I could have bought other books that both include the good explanations and comprehensive multiple choice questions."
3,Okay,"It has a lot of good practice tests and prompts, but there's too little on effective strategies. If you like the saturation approach, this is good, but if you're looking to refine your skills and find advice on how to get top points, don't choose this book."
1,Poor,"I received the order yesterday. It is not as pictured. It was damaged and it did not contain keys. The damage was due to no packing material. The box wasn't even sealed, just had 3 plastic straps around it. In fact I think it is possible that it was already a return. The kicker here is that I have to cart it off to UPS to return it. So ""Returns Are Easy"" is a lie. You better think twice about ordering this item or any item like it."
2,The Best of Nightline: John Belushi's Career,"If you want a John Belushi video, don't buy this video. It does have about 5 to 10 minutes on john's career but the rest of the tape is the news for that week in March 1982 and doesn't involve Belushi at all. If you want Belushi, get Animal House or the Blues Brothers."
3,"Slow Going,","The author explores 9 examples of Americans in Guerrila war; 2 as the insurgent, 3 as counterinsurgent and the remaining can be classed as Foreign Internal Defense, which, depending on your inclination is a sub set of Security and Stability Operations or Counterinsurgency. In the remaining 4 cases, FID is support by proxy and copious amounts of US Cash and material.The book is ok but glosses over much. My suggestion? get a copy of Dr.David Kilcullen's ""28 Articles Fundamentals of Company Level Counterinsurgency"" This is free you can download it from either the CGCS or NDU Website. Now pick a conflict in history and use the 28 articles and formulate them into questions as you explore the conflict of your choice. You will gain a greater understanding of the complexities of COINTerry Tucker,US Army, SGM, Ret, PhDCSTC-AfghanistanTrainer and Doctrine Developer"
3,A Good Theoretical Analysis,"Although the book can be a slow read, the author's intent was to analyze the situations and discuss its implications in modern warfare theory. Anthony Joes is an expert on the military and international relations. Having met and spoken with Dr. Joes many times, I understand and appreciate the standpoint that he takes and why he has those viewpoints. If you are looking for a book detailing combat experiences and substantial action, try something else. I recommend this book if your interest lies in understanding what guerilla warfare really is and what it accomplishes. Anthony Joes has written several books on a variety of subjects. I recommend all of them to anyone interested in learning more about U.S. Military theory."
4,80's Flicks That R Classic...,"Movie to be taken with a grain of salt. But if movies such as Private Lessons, My Tutor, Porky's, Appeal to you from the Origins of MTV. By all means give it a try or view."
5,great movie,"If everyday life could be like this movie, there wouldnt be a unhappy person(man or woman) on this earth. These are great beach movies"
3,memories,"Amovie from the old days. When it was just fun, noboby got killed or turned into zombies. They smoked alittle weed and guys liked girls(naked boobs). While the B movies of the 70-80's had some terrible acting, the intent was fun and this movie was just that. It brought back some old memories of the times and is worth a laugh."
3,Campy old film,Used to own the house it was filmed in - funny to see it as a movie set -really campy beach flick.
5,Great Movie,"This is a great one of those 80's movies,they don't make anymore, brings back the memories of high school days and drive-in theaters.Would recommend to buy this movie."
4,Good film,"I purchased Hardbodies 1 and 2 the other day, they were both good films, I like the 1st one the best. I'm glad that they released it on dvd."
1,Hardbodies 1& 2 review,"I am not going to say this dvd set is bad but I would suggest you keep looking on the Internet for some movies made more current, at least 2008. If you see these dvds you will see why somebody came up with the idea for breast implants. As a lot of these ladies could use some. Keep on looking elsewhere."
1,Unbelievably aweful,Looking at the promo on my smartphone I couldn't read the abstract. Wasn't sure if it was a workout movie or just a cheesy teen flick. I still don't know what it was - best case a hard to scan spoof on goofy teenage boy lust movie from the 70's. Whatever. One of the most useless productions ever distributed. Don't waste a minute of your time staring at this train wreck.
3,One for the archives,"Although this film isn't one of the highlights of the early eighties, I will say that a hundred or more years from now, some of these films will be seen as a window to the culture of the early 80's. It's really like looking into a window of the past to see what was there, what people were saying, what people were wearing, their hairstyles, and what types of scenary was there.This film actually is a lot better done than what is credited for since it has made an impact on the social conscious of society and because so many people have seen it. Not everybody can make a movie like this. It is like looking at a party, but a lot of things were working for it - the pacing, the good looking actors, the cheeze, and the obligatory plot."
2,Hardbodies Collection,"It wasn't what I thought that it was supposed to be would be. All in all it was not too bad, it was okay though."
3,For someone who really doesn't have a clue...,"This book isn't as comprehensive as I would have wanted. The information is basic and geared towards someone who has never held a screwdriver in her life. Although the repairs she reviews are thorough, I was hoping for something that focuses on more complex issues."
5,"A clear, concise instruction guide to fix everyday problems",I found this book to be very helpful when faced with a leaky faucet and a defective oven heating element. It is simply written and easy to understand. The illustrations are especially helpful and clear. This book is a wonderful reference and makes a great gift for all occasions.
1,Gary Ezzo controversy!,"Gary Ezzo's teachings are very controversal even among Christian churches where his courses are used. My spouse and I took his ""Growing Kids God's Way"" class which is the basis for much of the material in this book. Do your research (try a search on the internet) on Gary Ezzo before accepting him as a ""parenting authority""!A valuable alternative to the Ezzo's teachings is ""How to Really Love Your Child"" by Dr. Ross Campbell, available here at amazon.com. Learn how much WE as parents need to change and grow in our own maturity, as well as our need to guide and discipline our children!"
3,Don't buy for Sony Walkman MDR-025 or MDR-027,"These are perfectly OK ear cushions, but based on other reviews and on their oval shape I ordered these for my Sony Walkman MDR-025 and MDR-027 headphones (no one, including Sony, offers exact replacement cushions for those models). They turned out to be too small and became stretched thin, causing them to eventually tear. I then ordered the ""2-5/16"" Foam Pad Ear Cover for Philips Sony Headphones"" also from Amazon (3 pairs for far less than the cost for one pair of these Plantronic ear cushions) and found that they fit easily (no drastic stretching) despite the fact that they are round rather than oval. So if you have the Sony MDR-025 or 027 headphones and need replacement ear cushions, don't order these, order the ""2-5/16"" Foam Pad Ear Cover for Philips Sony Headphones""."
5,just what I needed,"I have an old plantronics headset and the cushions disintegrated. After searching the net I found them on Amazon through this company , Great price.I'm very pleased."
2,Problem with presentation on web site,"Unfortunately the size of these ear cushions was not indicated on the web site. A reviewer said they were too large for his/her use, so I figured they must be large which was what I needed, but they are way too small for the ear phones I have. All products that are size sensitive should clearly show the dimensions of the product. I wasted nearly $6.00 on something I cannot use."
4,Not bad for the price,Not bad for the price. It fits my Plantronics DSP 400 USB headset. It went on a bit tight and I expected to tear it pulling it on but thankfully it did not. I just put it on over the original cushions that were started to crumble. Price is reasonable and I've never seen this item in a store.
1,product was great quality,"Product was great n so is the company. It is to bad I ordered the wrong size, but the company was more than willing to work with me. I will be more than willing to order again from this company in the future if they have the product I seek. Thanks again Peggy Sue"
2,Too big,"I dont think anyone owns the headset that these are for. The description should have been more specific, advising buyers that its not for the regualr earphone/ipod earphones"
5,Perfect Fit,"Although you wouldn't know it at first glance, the foam pads on this Plantronics headset can be replaced. Tear off the old ones and put these on and you'll never know the difference."
4,May not be the exact fit for the DSP 400,"I purchased these to replace the shredded cushions on my Plantronics DSP 400 USB headset. These wrap all the way around the earpiece whereas the original cushions were tucked into the edges of the backside. They still work, though it feels as if the foam is stretched a bit on the ear side and may not last as long. Good thing I ordered two."
5,Good Quality,"My headset is compact with oddly shaped earpieces. When the cushions which came with it wore out, I couldn't find any to fit. Ordered these. They ended up fitting just fine. Using them for almost a year now and they are as good as the day I put them on. Easy to clean (rinse in cool water). Perfect for my needs."
2,Doesn't deliver,The progress of St. Teresa's soul is glossed over despite the subtitle. The book effectively describes her progress in establishing convents and monasteries against rather formidable political oppostion but does little to illuminate the nature of her mysticsm. In addition the constant introduction of Spanish phrases seems gratuitous at times as does the introduction of new personalities with little or no background on their connection to Teresa. I found myself thumbing back to see if there was a previous reference to an individual several times. Overall I felt less than enthusiastic about the approach here.
1,great disappointment,"Although Medwick is an assiduous researcher, she is a relentlessly dreary writer. Anyone interested in the life, mind, spirit and times of Teresa of Avila should look elsewhere. Lots of details as to where Teresa went when; lots of names of supporters and persecutors, ad nauseum. All in all, an awful book."
4,Very good introduction to the woman and the saint and her time,"It's very well written, clear, and gives an overview of what was going on during her time. It gives you a good picture of how Teresa was and how savvy she was in her dealings with the church and the male leaders. She was a woman navigating in a male dominated world -- something every woman can identify with. I would absolutely recommend this as a great introduction to a very interesting saint."
5,"An engrossing, informative, in-depth survey.","Cathleen Medwick's Teresa Of Avila (0-394-54794-2, $26.00) provides a lively biographical sketch of Saint Teresa, a 16th-century mystic whose writings contributed much to the Catholic Church. Chapters examine her life, personality, and sometimes unorthodox version of spirituality in chapters which examine her focus on the reform f the Carmelites. An engrossing, in-depth survey."
2,Teresa of Avila The progress of a soul,"A well researched book, but a dull tale of medieval, feminine psychoneurosis masquerading as piety and spirituality. As a Catholic physician, it is amazing to me that this weird, far out woman was cannonized."
5,LOVEE,"Came within the time it said it would, and it's just really great. I watch it allll the time :)"
3,Happy 12 year old daughter!,This video has made my daughter very happy. She has viewed several times with and without friends. It is a success for this young teenage female market. I still prefer Eric Clapton!!
4,By the looks of it...,"By the looks of it, this release already has one flaw....where is Stole My Heart (their best song , in my opinion...)?? this is a huge disappointment for me but i guess i will still buy it because these guys have actual vocal talent (unlike many artists today)."
5,Awesome,One direction are awesome i own there up all night album i love it this is even more ecitieing i never been to there concerts i will be
5,Christmas,Bought this to put back for a Christmas gift. No problems with the package or item. Pleased with t he product.
4,"A beautiful, tender book of pictures.","Lawrence Grecco's photographs provide a texture uncommon in the artform. There is a sensitivity here, a strange, weighty slowness. One gets the impression that you're not looking at a still picture at all, but a few moments blending into one another, less an instant than idea, a feeling. Grecco captures a complete world; he manages to make a several-hundred year-old, highly public tradition seem private, quiet and secluded.The wrestlers are all men, of course, but the pictures are often disturbingly intimate, delicate, and emotional. Perhaps what has really been captured is the athlete's love for their history and culture -- respect, essentially.The book's text offers a short history of the origins of the sport as well as a subtle and honest look into Grecco's personal experiences during the years spent documenting the event. No doubt, it is the same way that readers will view the photographs."
4,Good tuner. Needs good antenna.,"As this is the only component HD radio currently available, you're either going to get it or you won't.When the HD signal is strong, the sound quality is very good -- wide dynamic range and very little noise. If the signal is weak, then the tuner will switch between analog and digital versions of the signal, which is disconcerting as the acoustic ""image"" widens for HD and narrows for analog FM. To deal with this I would have prefered a way of telling the system to ignore HD signals below a certain signal strength."
1,A Piece of Junk,I am completely upset about this purchase. We installed this radio in a commercial account. It worked for less than 24 hours. It is a piece of junk. And I do not know how to get in touch with anyone who can allow me to return this product.
3,HD Radio is NOT Cost Effective !,"HD Radio reception is problematic, even with AM-loop and external FM-dipole antennas. The HD channels are just repetitve programming, as copies of their analog parents. Save yourselves $250 and just listen to HD Radio on-line, if you have to, or just buy cheap analog radios. HD Radio jams our airways with adjacent-channel digital interference and will destroy the AM band ! Just Say No to HD Radio !"
4,Sangean HDT-1,"The latest tuner for digitally transmitted, over the airwaves, free AM and FM broadcasts that improve the signal quality, number of stations (x2) and information accessable on the crystal screen. Rated four stars only because it is difficult for non-computer friendly people to program. Five stars for everyone else LOL."
4,Sangean HD reciever,"This is my second HD radio, the other being a In-dash from JVC. I enjoy the HD format and a home reciever is much better at reproducing the HD signals that the mobile reciever. It is attractive and easy to set up. Searching for only HD stations in easy. When you shut the Sangean off while listening to an HD channel, it comes back on on the HD channel, most often; twice it has tuned away to another station. Overall, this is almost a great product.But, I could have used a wider angle on the IR remote, instead I had to turn the unit. Pressing preset, then selecting the preset is annoying. One touch would have been better."
5,Great Reception,"I recently purchased the Sangean HD tuner because of a change in the analogue signal that left us without classical music. The Classical music was available in HD from the same frequency that had previously carried the analogue classical signal. I find the reception to be a great improvement over the analogue signal and the Sangean tuner is easy to use, providing excellent reception as if we were playing a CD."
3,"It's OK, but HUGE!","I have no problems with the tuner, except that I didn't realize how large it was. There was no need for Sangean to make it this size. This is a trend I've noticed with many electronics manufacturers when they release a first-generation product. A perfect example were the first-generation Blu-Ray players; they were massive. Now they're the size of an average DVD player. The technology exists to make these units small from the start, so why don't the manufacturers do so? Who wants a clunky tuner with a 17""-wide footprint taking-up valuable real estate? Keep in mind this is only a tuner, not a receiver with an amp, so the size is completely unnecessary."
4,A Hidden feature...,"This unit is capable of receiving MW Stereo (AM Stereo) from stations using the Motorola C-Quam system. Found that out from 2 stations in our area that broadcast in MW Stereo. Since we can't put links, you can do a Google search on ""sangean HDT AM Stereo"" for more information. Currently this info is not documented in the instruction book.Other then that, it's a decent hybrid digital tuner that let's opens up a new world in radio listening!"
1,Big disapointment,"Along with reception of new HD stations I expected high quality FM & AM to go with my complete top line stereo system. Instead, the HDT-1 gives me very poor quality, even less than a table-top clock radio. Very high output - can only turn amp up to lowest level - and painful to listen to. No response to inquiries from Sangean."
3,Sangean HD Tuner,"Great tuner. Remote control works well through whole house audio infrared ports on the room keypads. RDS song display works great. If you're wanting to put this somewhere where you need quiet when the radio isn't on, you may want to look elsewhere. Unit has hum or buzzing sound that is always there. Not loud - just kind of annoying. After I had this connected up to the whole house audio system in the basement, I considered moving it upstairs in order to see the RDS on the display, but after hearing the thing buzz, decided to leave it in the basement. You also won't want to use this as your primary clock. The clock on mine has lost 20 minutes in one month of being in service. Great tuner though, which is probably the most important thing in buying a tuner."
4,"Good Receiver , but few bells and whistles would be nice","Sangean HD Radio is an adequate addition to your audio component group. It does all that sangeen claims, however, for the price, it would be nice if it had a few more bells and whistles, like a sleep function, a turn on function, etc."
4,Fully pleased,"I bought this HR radio tuner for use on my traditional receiver, but decided to use it with my big HDTV. The outputs work fine in the TV audio inputs, and with proper setting the TV screen goes off except to show volume changes or audio adjustments. So I have HDTV and radio together, using the surround sound of the TV. The stereo system remains in another room.The performance startled me when it first came on--I was not used to such sound. The absence of any humming, hissing, or static was breathtaking. The antennae included work great for me--I just listen to local stations and they come in at optimal strength. The only reason for four stars instead of five is the lack of more in the way of outputs--a digital out, for instance, that might carry the station information data out as well as just audio. Also, a secondary output to the CD/DVD/VCR might allow recording a radio program without going back and unplugging things."
3,Typos mar the book,"The plotting, characterizations and style are all as good as they were in the first 4 books in the Mommy-Track series..However, there are typos throughout the book. For example (page numbers in the hardcover edition):""I'd staffed looking"" (instead of ""I'd started looking""; p. 2)""you're husband"" (p. 125)""temperment"" (p. 152)""stiletto-healed alligator pump"" (p. 181)""miniscule"" (p. 271).I'm sad and a little disturbed. Did the publishers decide to save money by cutting back on proof-readers? Did they think that computer spell-checkers can replace them? Do they think that readers no longer notice typos or care about them?.The typos marred my appreciation of an otherwise enjoyable book."
3,somewhat disappointing,The mystery novel wasn't quite as good or as funny as Waldman's other books. The overall plot was rather unbelievable and the characters were overplayed and stereotypical.Agreed with the other review - far too many errors in syntax and spelling.
4,Essential to my New Orleans collection,"On Spiritland, Coco makes a gumbo of just about every Louisiana musical style I've heard, yet delivers his own recognizable brand of New Orleans funk. This CD is fun, meditative and thoughtful....a real treat among the typical New Orleans musical lineup.My favorite track is St. John's Bayou which evokes all the imagery, magic and mystique of New Orleans. A chirping nighttime choir mixed with a teasing calypso, the wayward sax, flirting trumpet coaxed along by Coco's gutteral growl casts a sensual trance as thick as a bayou fog. My hair curls from the humidity.The Spiritland track casts a similar spell accompanied by a sweet fiddle and a brief chorus, a nice touch. Every track on this CD is good listenin'."
4,Clymer Manual Kawasaki KZ1000/KZ1100,"This manual serves well its basic and intended purpose of maintenance and repair. However, for my specific need, there was no discussion of how to deal with rust in the gas tank, which is not so uncommon as these late '70's and early '80's bikes continue to survive the ravages of time. Beyond its maintenance and repair purpose, any questions regarding re-jetting carburetors for a non-stock exhaust system or pod air filters would not be served. Photos were adequate, with clear and visible ""arrow"" inserts, and they ranged from sharp to fuzzy, and so could be updated and improved with higher resolution digital photos. This manual will stand on its own, but could be supplemented with a factory manual where some clarification may be needed. All said, this is a very good manual, and a real bargain if you could buy it at a discounted price."
4,We Love it!!,"My daughter loves My Little Pony, so when I saw that they had a Pony movie for the videonow, I knew she just had to have it! Well, it was a great purchase!! She loves it. It is all she wants to watch when in the car and sitting at hockey games. Shipping was fast and item came to me just as described."
2,"Some good, some bad","Of these 4 tools, only 2 are worth keeping. The Davinci tool (the red one) actually hurt me more. The accu-massage is pretty worthless. The Back Buddy mini is good as is the Back Buddy. The Back buddy is my favorite. I use it more for stretching than for massage. It's not worth it to get this set though for only those two."
2,Davinci disappointment,Davinci tool is way too soft. I am a small woman and it easily folds under my weight. Other tools are great.
3,Davinci,"Great product, received later than expected - packing could have been better. Items in great condition."
2,poor quality,"I like products carried by Johnson strings and think that they are wonderful people, However, I'm sorry to say this product lets me down. First off, it did not properly fit my kid's 1/2 violin. Those screws are not strong and the thread is not in good precision. The pressure is not applied evenly when the screws are tightened. We ended up replacing the screws from another older chin rest."
5,Something the Russians did well,"I bought this camera a little while ago, and I'm amazed by it. I've taken pictures at 100, 200 and 400 ASA film...if you want to get pictures that are fairly sharp, use 400 film on the automatic settings, and you'll be pretty impressed. At 400, the picture is more sharp then 100 or 200, but you really get a hint of the rich color that abounds at the lower speeds.I bought this camera because I wanted to make ""Artistic"" looking pictures without having to haul around a bulky bag with filters, lenses, flashes, etc. only to have 1 or 2 good pictures on an entire roll. So far, this camera has done the trick, and I've gotten lots of compliments, albeit from ""normal"" people, but they think i've spent a lot more than I actually have."
1,The Lomo is all a marketing fad,"Re-read the reviews - even the five stars say it takes blurry, bad photos. You don't need a [price] camera to do that. Buy a Holga for [price] and save some money.My biggest pet peeve about these reviews is that they all talk about low light non-flash photography like it is a new party drug. Hello, you can turn the flash off on your point-and-shoot to get the same effect (the camera will adjust exposure time) and you still have a zoom and fill flash if you want it for the same money.Bottom line is I have about 10 camera and I use the Lomo for very specific photos. If you can only have 2 or 3 cameras, this should not be one of them. Hats off to the Lomo marketing team."
2,Camera for the self conscious,"These cameras are fun, but they are not great. They're the photographic equivalent of a mono tape recorder that takes 4 big batteries.They may be good for a high school art project but they are not equal to taking good pictures. They produce unpredictable results when you want consistency. The results from using open flash or long exposure soon become boring.However, a good camera if you're trying to chat-up an art school chick. She wont dig your digi compact but her knickers will fly off when you produce this.Perhaps worth the investment."
5,Requires practice,"Okay, I just got my lomo and have taken 3 rolls of film. After perusing the internet and actually seeing other pictures people have taken with their own lomo's, I have to tell you that it isn't as easy as they make it look. It does require practice and you do usually get at least one really cool picture per roll. It's pretty fun to take everywhere and you are not blinding people with a flash and drawing unwanted attention to yourself. What this feature does is actually get you to take more pictures and of things you might not have before. If you don't have an artistic mind, this is not the camera for you. Trying to explain a beautiful and unfocused picture to my Mother as a work of art gets a bit tedious. Anyway, it is a very exciting, different artistic medium, that really is fun and worth it."
1,Are You Kidding?,"Lomo? They should call it ""Lame-o."" Guess what kids? The pics that it takes aren't ""cool,"" they just suck. Better advice is to get one of those old Diana cameras and put that to the test. They have much better results than this bogus piece of pseudo-Cold War schlock."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This camera is a piece of junk. I'm glad it broke before I got through one roll, otherwise I would have smashed it myself. Plus, there is no built in flash."
5,lomo user,"LOMO has amazing optics, only very expensive world class optics may give you the same results at night. If you use 400 films it will help you to hold the camera still and will increase the sharpness. Day photos are VERY sharp and colorful. It is possible to Bracket exposure by changing the light meter settings. Use the ""A"" - Auto for all you work. If you would like to use the little flash switch to 2.8, 4, 5,6... modes according to the distance (see you flash manual). Camera will do 1/60 of the second in Aperture mode. Try LOMO, you will love the camera."
3,Mania for details,"To call this a novel is a misnomer. It's a catalogue of Baker's at times anal reflections on the ephemera of modern life, such as escalator etiquette and how corporate carpeting feels underfoot, conveniently hung on the frame of a day at the office. As such, it's a curious combination of delight and tedium. Given the many, many subjects he covers and the plethora of footnotes, I'm surprised there is no index. The book needs one."
5,An astonishing book,"I first started reading this book when it was in the New Yorker magazine and I remember after reading a few paragraphs and then starting to read the longer, more detailed sentences, I was enthralled and delighted. What amazing detail! What an eye for the minutiae in life. I have made a point to read everything else he has written. Certainly one of the best new young writers around. Frankly, it is good to read these other reviews since I hardly know anyone who has read him."
2,Irritating,Pretentious trash. A very annoying book. I take comfort in the fact that its cultural references are so obscure and trivial that the book will be nearly meaningless in twenty years time. I would be surprised if anyone is reading it at that point.
2,Read in small doses.,"This semi-novel has no plot, but it has an endless supply of footnotes which distract you to no end. It does have some funny lines but all too rare. My favorite: ""This isn't the Land of the Lotus eaters, Move it ladies I kept screaming get a life buddy, because in fact, the narrator/ main character has no life."
1,Unreadable,"I enjoyed baker's previous books, VOX and Fermata, but found this book to be completely unreadable and boring."
4,Unforgettable Mens Room Riff,"I read (most of) this book several years ago, and I have never forgotten the extended riff on office men's room etiquette, and the detailed description of how the narrator overcame his shy bladder syndrome. It's worth the price of admission."
3,Obessed with all the little details,"First off, you should know that much of this book is footnotes. If you find this style annoying as I do, you may have a difficult time with the book.While the book is an interesting read, I was a bit dissappointed and unfufilled. I was hoping for a nice message about life and how to live it, yet didn't even get hardly much of a conclusion at all. The book is full of tangents (perhaps that's the point) and seems to dwell on all of the tiny minutia of every single thought that might go on in one's mind while on their lunch break.It's certainly a 'different' kind of novel, however it left me cold."
2,Too much navel-gazing,"Mercifully the novel improves as it reaches its conclusion but, for the most part, this struck me as an exercise in self-indulgence. The overall impression is of a man desperate to impress upon his reader the extent to which he contemplates the minutiae of everyday life. There are some enjoyable interludes in which he entertainingly digresses on the importance of footnotes and ponders the possibility of urinating on someone's head but, sadly, much of this novel is simply stultifyingly tedious."
5,Still Baker's Best,I just re-read The Mezzanine. I still regard it as Baker's best. I don't know of a better wordsmith working today.
2,"Such Brilliant Description, but to What End?","Baker's ""Mezzanine"" came to me highly reccommended by a trusted source, someone with whom I have shared my enjoyment of Delillo and Will Self. I approached Baker's novel optimistically, and was sorely disappointed. Baker's style is indeed unique and his diction is flawless. For this, he is to be commended. What ""The Mezzanine"" lacked, however, is anything transcendent. Though, as other reviewers noted, Baker does describe the minutae of our lives in unique ways, he still describes minutae. Perhaps this novel is a postmodern examination of the emptiness of corporate life--postmodern in own emptiness. If so, a short story would have sufficed. After about forty pages, this novel begins to feel tedious. Eventually, one begins to wonder if anything apart from a neurotic impulse was propelling Baker to lengthen this book."
5,amazing profiles,"In Search Of Dignity is an amazing book for anyone intereseted in cultural anthropology and photography. I perused these pages one time on Amazon and realized that it was an important profile of people untouched by todays materialistic lifestlyes. They indeed still live as their ancestors and tribes before them and its remarkable how real these people are. Mind you many of the bodies are scarred, tattood, and pierced but it just brings out the symbolism of their beliefs. I thought this book was well done and it should be praised not lauded. The text written is very informative as well, but its the photography that makes this book unforgettable"
3,Racist thriller.,"The action and plot from this book seem to come straight out of a how-to book for action stories. An interesting story but very predictable. In addition the characters are boring and one-sided, and each and every Arab is a lying, stealing, murdering weasel. A good action packed racist novel, if you're into that kind of thing. (Sorry for the sarcasm). It does give a very good view on modern Israel's society, albeit a very biased view."
1,no similiarities in music,The only reason I can't recommend this product is because Bam and I have no music tastes in common. If you like his taste in music then this album is for you.
5,Great CD,"Ok, I have never heard of some of the bands on this CD, but I have to admit that I love this CD. It is the only one in my CD player anymore. I like all of the songs but some favorites are Rock N Roll- The Sounds, Familiar Realms- CKY, and Guilty- The Rasmus. This CD is one to get! Good job Bam."
5,Best CD Ever,this is the best cd ever i boughtt his cd mainly for the theme for viva la bam and soon i found how awesome this cd is i highly recomend anyone who likes rock'n'roll to buy this album and H.I.M.'s Love Metal album 2--- YEA VIVA LA BAM!!!!!!!!!!
3,Okay nail hardener,"I found this nail hardener to be adequate. I have very thin, weak nails that bend and break easily. I am searching for a nail hardener that will do just that - harden. I bought Daby after reading other reviews thinking that this might be ""the one."" In my honest opinion, the Daby Nail Hardener is no worse, but really no better than the myriad other nail hardeners that I have tried over the years. The search continues."
4,What order??,"I did receive this product, but not from Amazon!! I tried to order it, but you're system wouldn't process my info, so I got it from a better company. As far as this product is concered, it does a pretty good job, but does not stay on when you're in too much water. I put it on my nails at night & that seems to work the best for me. It stays on and my nails are getting stronger, which is what I wanted. I'm very happy with the product, but not with AMAZON!!!!!"
5,Great for everyone.,"Too many people have a vitamin D deficiency and even when s/he do try to remedy the deficiency they do not take enough supplements to make a difference. VegLife makes it easy. I have been taking 6000 I.U.'s a a day and have raised my readings to normal... my doctor recently told me. Since I consume a plant based diet I knew my vitamin supplements should also be plant based. But most importantly for me, since swallowing pills is a struggle, I like that I only have take three not-so big pills with my fruit and almond milk shake in the morning."
5,Less is More,"What a treat this album is ... beautiful as much for the quiet between the notes as for the notes themselves. On first listen, these melodies are engaging and even a little hypnotic. After a while, each tune seems to create a ""story,"" that becomes richer and more fascinating each time you listen."
5,Satisfied customer in Minnesota.,"After listening to the soothing music,of this C.D.while driving and relaxing at home,I rate it right up there with the best. I think this young man has a great future in the music business.Good luck, and best wishes to him."
2,"better than nothing, but not much better","go for a higher-quality product. with this one, you get only what you pay for - which isn't much."
4,A Real Gem,"This album, recorded in 1979 while on tour, is a real gem. Late Stitt, to be sure, a wonderful rhythm section is allowed space, a rarity in many Stitt recordings. The quartet plays as a group and anyone unaccustomed would have little clue as to the featured artist. At the time, Stitt's dental problems (restored later) may have impaired his tone but certainly not his creativity. Curiously, the selections on this recording also appear on another album ""Back To My Own Home Town."" in which Stitt performs a vocal. Two of the selections have their titles switched. The cover art is also used on other Stitt albums. Nevertheless, this is a very enjoyable album!."
4,Storm Surge just gets better and better!!,"I was captured by the web version of Storm Surge then the first published release but KatLyn has successfully taken Storm Surge to another level. It is an exciting, grip you, thriller, well written and professionally edited. What do you want from a story? One you can actually remember the names of the characters? Have you ever started a book you just couldn't put down? Well Storm Surge has it...ALL...great plot and characters with love scenes that can sizzle even a hot AZ night! KatLyn has nurtured the growth of Storm Surge with professionalism, pride and love. You will not be disappointed!"
2,Could have been better,"I just red this book and I am desappointed! Where is the story? It's sex, sex and sex. Don't think wrong, usually I like the sex part in lesbian romance, I'm a huge fan of Radcliffe, but this one is too much!If the police story has been in the foreground, it would have been better. But the story is shallow and a lot of it doesn't seem real or even possible.Too bad, it could have been a great book with less sex and more story."
2,Baby Changing table-Windsor,"Delivery was a problem. It came 2 weeks later than expected. My daughter opened it after her shower and it was damaged. Now in returning it, I am told it is no longer made. She has the crib and armoire but now we can't get the changing table to match. The delivery company was not good and now it's sitting in my living room waiting to be picked up and for the deliver company to contact me."
4,One man's suspenseful journey through the frozen wilderness,"Although at times this book becomes slightly boring, the overall effect makes it well worth reading. A multitude of stories are told throughout time, yet few truly well-told tales exist among them. These well-told tales are not only memorable, they also exhibit exceptional grammatical ingenuity. The extreme setting and vivid, descriptive adjectives, by a notable author, make this a remarkable piece of literature. A lone, rather unlikable man and his dog are portrayed throughout the story. This inhumane man, in ingnoring his elders, does himself great damage. As the temperature in the story lowers, the suspense rises considerably. The reader may find themself at the edge of their seat while reading, as the man, oblivious to the cold, continues to trudge on. This book ought to be read by everyone, for the theme of the story appears to be that oftentimes an animal's instincts prove to be far better than one human's supposed intellegence"
2,Horrendously overpriced,How can you justify charging the price of a normal-length novel for this short story that looks like it was printed at Kinko's?The book was fine - but your pricing is NOT.
3,T.B.A.F,"For my english class we did a unit on short stories and we read the book To Build A Fire By: Jack London it was an okay book but it was very confusing at times This book was okay I guess the reason why I gave this book only three stars is because the book wasn't very detailed! Just if you're wondering my answer would have to be no, I would not reccomend this book Usually I enjoy Jack London's Material but this story I just wasn't satisfied With SORRY! :("
2,Horrific flashbacks from English class,"I'll come right out and say it. THIS BOOK SUCKS! We readthis in English and I think the class used the time to sleep.I strongly disapprove of this novel. It's about a guy who treksthrough Alaska and the Yukon with his dog. That's the entire novel.Just walking and walking and walking. Just boring and boring andboring. Trust me, there are better Jack London books out there. Read those!"
2,so so Sedona flick,I love Sedona which is why I watched this movie. It was a sweet simple story with lessons in what is important in life. It sounds better than it is. The scenery is why I stuck it out and watched the whole thing. I didn't see the ending coming though.
3,This movie is nothing to rave about,I was all excited to watch this movie cuz we plan to make a trip to Sedona soon. Argh! This move may have ruined the surprise for us and the storyline was pretty lame. :-(
3,Nice little movie. Not bad.,"It's a well written low-budget movie. It's good for what it is, the idea works, Frances Fisher is awesome in it, she's perfect. The photography's OK, it's not exactly epic, some of the street scenes in the local places could have been photographed better, but I know they couldn't just take over the town to film it so they had to do some of it very quickly without getting in the way of the tourists, so it is what it is."
5,Absolutely loved it....Great story and SO Sedona!,"Saw the Sedona movie on opening night in Sedona and loved it. The story was fun, had elements of drama, comedy, and a bit of mystery. Acting was excellent, music was terrific (done by local artists), and the filming of the scenery will take your breath away. I understand that the characters were based on real people who live and work in Sedona, and in some cases, the actual residents were the actors.The movie portrays some un-grounded, lovable, happy folks in an affectionate way, which will make you smile and chuckle, and the fun part is, many folks in Sedona are that way! And it has a unique ending. You will watch this feel-good movie over and over and never tire of it."
4,Charming and meaningful ... captures the spirit and scenery of Sedona.,"Sedona is beautiful. Although no camera can contain Sedona's spectacular scenery, this cinematography comes as close as possible. And although no script can convey Sedona's charming and meaningful spirit, this one comes close. Frances Fisher is brilliant."
5,WONDERFUL MOVIE!,"a movie I plan to ""purchase"" a copy for myself! great film worthy of a personal copy for my home!"
3,Nice...,Beautiful view of Sedona and that make me want go visit there someday... Good story and Beautiful view of Arizonia...
4,SEDONA,The photography is incredible!Sedona is beautiful!The story narrative is also good.Very pleasant;makes one wish to return to Sedona time and again.
3,where there is a will there is a way!,Light movie about life and how there are no circumstances in life but rather everything has a devine connetion and order.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Savage Dragon is torn between his government work, and the bad things he knows are happening to his friends and fellow city dwellers back in Chicago.He leaves to go back to help. The Vicious Circle criminal organisation has been clever, and worked together to defeat heroes and other law enforcement.Dragon has to find a wedge to drive between them."
4,If you like the sound of a violin...,"This is a great introduction to the sound of string jazz. The songs are lively sound combinations that inspire interesting, lighthearted conversations. Perfect for a gathering with friends! The highest notes are extremely vibrant and exciting, the low sounds resound deeply in the memory. The tunes are smooth blends of violin, piano, and bass with improvs that you can listen to again and again without catching every trick. If you want to add jazz strings to your musical repertoire, then this CD is the perfect option."
4,like arcade fire on happy pills,"if you read the other reviews you will see it is either an album you'll love or hate it is unashamed over the top pop melodies with everything including kitchen sink mentality,opera, shouty chorus pop harmonies and manic energy and that is just the first song.It may catch you by suprise, I should probably hate this album but was won over by its innocence, its playfulness and pure enthuiasum."
5,A Little Bit of Everything,"Like the previous review, I think that Architecture In Helsinki can sound like The Arcade Fire at times, they also can sound like The Fiery Furnaces, but with more focused and shorter songs. They use a very wide array of instruments that go along with the new 80's fad that is being continually found in many of the new critically successful and commercially successful bands of the moment. Hopefully Architecture In Helsinki will be heard by the right people in the right places and gain popularity. It may be hard for them to do so though because of all of the crap that gets played on MTV and their lack of similarity to them."
5,I have a crush on Architecture in Helsinki,"Dear AIH,Will you go to the prom with me? You are the new masters of Kitchen Sink Foreign Pop Rock. Your album is like sweet candy fizzilating in my ear and tickling the insides of my brain with fuzzy gaseous emissions of soothing sounds of musical instrumentalosity!When I see you live i am moved to join your mailing list, yet you do not send me emails of gentle affection and information on your touring rock and roll lifestyle.I have a crush on you, Architecture in Helsinki, but if you want to go to prom as friends my dad can give us a ride in our Ford Taurus station wagon.XOXO"
2,Ever heard of The Sparks?,"This is Polyphonic Spree meets The Sparks. I like The Sparks. I hate Polyphonic with a passion, which doesn't put this album in a good place. I hate girl singers who sound like 12 year old girls. I'm not ammused by bands that think they're theatrical stage productions. There's not one coherent thought or sound on this album which makes all that much more difficult for me to listen to. With the exception of ""Maybe You Can Owe"", which still sounds like half of a really good song, I'd say pass on this album and pick up ""Lil' Beethoven"" by The Sparks. Far more enjoyable for this sort of sound."
1,Don't make the same mistake I did,"Bought this CD based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums I like, and man, what a mistake. This CD borders on unlistenable, with no discernable melody/talent to be found. I'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover...I consider ""Blueberry Boat"" to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible."
1,Annoying,"This is probably one of the most annoyingly worst albums I've ever heard in my life.What is this?If you like this, than like it.But I just can't see what situation I'd ever be in that could call for something as annoying as this.In the woods? NopeIn my car? NopeOn the ocean? NopeI really just can't figure this kind of music out. and I listen to wacked out music...but...I don't know man.It may be a New England thing or something.Yo. I found this really cute album. Oh....ohhhh....yeeah.Worst ever."
2,Movie was Better,"..... I'm disapointed in how the series turned out. In the movie, The 8 devil's had supernatural type power's. In the Series, the demons, have a more Futureistic type power. They seem to have a more Alien and Robotic power than the historic type abilities. I won't go into very many detail's, simplely because any true Anime fan will purchase this anyway. I will admit the Artistic value of the series is excellent, Although some charecters seem younger while others seem older. I suggest a try it before you buy it. Local Blockbuster's are ignorant so try a service like Netflix.com to preview. I wish i'd listen to my own advice sometimes LOL."
3,Good Price and value but not as good as the movie,"This series is a good Price and value but it is not as good as the movie. The Movie was great. It is hard to describe what made the movie work. Maybe it was a combination of the storyline, action sequences, and characters, but it all came together with a classic ending. This series seem to lack some of the chemistry of the movie but it was a good watch for a slow afternoon."
4,ninja,I bought this because I am a big fan of the movie. I haven't watched all the episodes yet but it seems ok so far. The animation is good.
5,"Ninja Scroll Series- Not as good as the original, but very close","I thought Ninja Scoll was the best Ninja anime that I have ever seen. When I heard there was a Ninja Scroll Series out on DVD, I had to get it. It was as good as I hoped it would be. Lots of fighting, and very brutal. You can get the entire series for dirt cheap. A definite must have, if you liked the original Ninja Scroll feature movie."
2,its alright,its alright didn't compare to the original movie at all and has a different art style over all not my type of anime but was defiantly good Arrived on time came as advertised metal tin and all even had a little Jubie action Figure witch was way cool. Great Job![...]
5,It will make you want to sit thru the whole series at once!,"This is an awsome series with plenty of swords, blood, and well thought out battles. It is a great addition to my collection of anime."
2,Not very happy...,"We bought this unit less than 2 years ago, replacing an almost 20 year old Black & Decker that we were giving to our son--it still worked great, but we were ready for something a little ""fancier"" and liked the idea of the convection oven (ended up using only a couple of times--way too noisy).Imagine our diapppointment when we went to toast items...and, nothing! Not even 2 years old and it no longer worked...wow! I agree with some of the other reviews...having to turn over breads to get even toasting, and total stainless which made it hot.Will not be replacing with the same, and will probably go back to a basic toaster-oven."
1,Hard to get toast setting right,Dial for the toast setting moves so slightly that it's easy to burn toast just by turning it a little too far to the right. Have burned many pieces of toast since getting this toast only a month ago and can't seem to get it right.
1,Garbage,I should have know better than to buy anything from Black and Decker. This oven is cheaply made and never worked properly since I got it. The plastic knobs cant with stand the heat and crack so they just do not function when you turn them. I tried to replace them but they are charging $10 for something that costs less than a dollar! Also if you plan to toast any more than 4 slices of bread you will have to wait 30 min after the first batch of 4 as the toaster shuts of after it gets to a certain temp. I will never buy from Black and Decker again.
1,Anybody want flaming tacos?,"Oven heats overly hot! Not once, but twice I was warming some taco shells, when they spontaneously ignited. Toast burns FREQUENTLY; timer seems to stick. I tried using the convection oven feature once and it didn't impress me. I have replaced this over-priced disappointment with a $10 Walgreens' toaster oven, which has worked beautifully so far. Black & Decker...stick to tools!"
1,loose wiring an issue,"My last toaster oven worked wonderfully for well over a decade, so I was predisposed for high toaster oven expectations. This toaster seemed OK at first... but... the wire connections were not good. After a couple of months the toaster setting stopped working and we had to use the timed bake element, which resulted in lots of burned toast. We were out of the warranty time line for a free replacement. The cost of repair was more than the cost of replacement. I finally gave in and got a new (different brand)toaster oven. After less than 6 months, I am very disappointed with the TRo700S."
1,Terrible oven,"There are many negatives about this oven!1. It is a strange size so many baking dishes that are suppose to fit toaster ovens do not fit this one! I still have not found a good baking dish to fit it.2. The metal rack that is in it does not work well: every time I pull out a pan on the rack, the rack slips out from one side so basically, you have to take your pan out put it somewhere, fix the rack, and then put the pan back in. Very frustrating!3. It burns everything. I have to cover everything I bake so that the top will not burn, including biscuits which is really frustrating because it greatly alters the cooking.I am looking for a different toaster oven now and I suggest you look somewhere else too."
1,WORST TOASTER OVEN EVER!!!,"Within a week the toast knob broke, then the timer knob got loose. The loudest timer you'll ever hear - sounds like a loud time bomb about the go off, which is appropriate actually. The entire housing is made from metal (nice job, Chinese engineers) so you burn yourself very easily if you're anywhere around it while it's on. Finally, the grounding went out so the entire unit becomes one big current flow, so now you get burned AND shocked when touching it. I'll be calling B&D shortly!! Wish I could give it zero stars."
3,knob broke after a month,"I only use it as a toaster. usually only once per day. After 6 1/2 weeks the toaster knob broke. I don't think the convection button works. It doesn't toast any faster with it on, and it doesn't make any sound. I think a fan is supposed to come on and I don't hear it."
4,Weak documentation,I was about ready to return this unit because it wouldn't read my SD Card and then as a last resort I tried putting the SD Card in UPSIDE DOWN (label down). It works!Too bad the manual gives no indication for how to orient the cards.
4,Great Card reader,This is a very nice card reader. Fits nicely in a 3.5 inch drive bay. The USB port is great since my case does not have up front access to one. Nice unit all the way around.
5,"Best 3.5"" card reader without the carnival-ride looks","Over the last few years, it seems drive-bay card readers have gone the way of Japanese car tuners. Laiden with LEDs, neon tubes, digital displays that display nothing of real use and die after two weeks, etc...This card reader has worked with every card I have inserted and I'm not annoyed by the design."
1,Sent the wrong item?,I was sent a external card reader instead of what I ordered. Maybe the picture and product information isn't the same.
4,Doesn't work (64 bit system?),"This reader was installed in a new Win7(64 bit) box for the sole purpose of reading my CF cards. The unit also has a USB port which does work, but it will not read CF cards. I tried two different cards that were working on my old XP box. Neither card would work on this reader. Of those two cards, one can no longer can be read on my XP box (coinsidence?). A previous reviewer alluded to a possible issue with 64bit systems (which doesn't make sense to me), but anything's possible. Guess I'll have to look to see what's available locally where at least returns/exchanges don't require an RMA process.UPDATE: Problem Solved - My camera is an older Nikon Coolpix. Formatting a CF card on that camera apparently formats to FAT. Formatting the same CF card on my system to FAT32 works with this reader in Win7(64 bit)."
4,good reader for a fair price,Reads way more flash card types than those listed in the lousey description by the vendor. The most popular formats are supported. The front USB port is also a great way to take advantage of those addional USB port pins left unused on your motherboard.
4,"convenient, but tricky","I had purchased this item several months ago. I installed it on my Gateway, and it wasn't too hard to install.... but there was little documentation to go by. The biggest problem that I had was that it slowed down my computer's start up time from about 20 seconds to roughly 4 minutes. I searched the web for updates and tech support, and even contacted Tiger Direct (who never returned my email). Well, by accident I had forgotten to remove a card from the reader one day, and when it started up, it only took the usual 20 seconds. So, FYI if your start up time is slowed down considerably after intalling this drive, just leave a card in the slot."
1,Single drive letter seems to trigger a bug under XP-SP3,"While the 1610 all-in-one card reader initially seemed good and can read SD cards larger than 2 GB, it has turned out to have subtle problems that have hurt me a good deal.A major complaint with these kinds of multi-card readers was that they added four drive letters to the list in My Computer. This company has fixed that, which I liked very much.However whatever is reducing the four drive letters to one has triggered a bug in XP's handling of some hidden partitions on my disk drives. I finally decided to unplug and discard this unit and return to a single SDHC card reader that is pushed into a USB slot."
5,I definately prefer this over the top my aquarium came with,"This is much better than the plastic one my aquarium came with. It is lightweight, easy to clean, I have not noticed any water evaporation ever since I installed this, and I can customize the back where the filters, etc., are stored using only a scissor. I definitely recommend this for anyone to use."
3,Non adjustable,It works if you want to cover the entirety of the standard 10 gallon aquarium. the plastic at the back is not adjustable so cutting needs to be done with a hot knife or simply remove it. The glass is primarily clear but because it isn't curved in any way water distribution and lighting arent the greatest. I would recommend this for a beginner planted tank.
1,"Need measurement for this Versa-Top 20 hinged aquarium cover, I have the measurement below, please take a look!","Oh well, I made my mistake on this product. This product is very strange, 20g tanks are not all the same, no doubt. Sadly the item I got DOES NOT FIT my 20g tank. In order to help future buyers, the measurements are 19.5 inches in length and 7.75 inches deep. If you have an aquarium that is 24 inches in length, DO NOT buy this, it will come up short. I will try to rig it and see if it will work with my 24 inches in length aquarium, please beware of the odd length of 19.5 inches. Good luck!"
1,Not enough info in description,"Not enough info in description. I know this is for a 20 gal tank but I have seen tanks of different shapes - some longer but not has wide, some shorter but deeper etc. Needs more then just the amount of water it will hold - the info needs to include the demensions of the lid so that potential purchasers will know what they are buying. Sorry this is not a comment on the actual product but on the desciption of the product, but I know of no other way to ask my question."
5,"At last, I can replace my bootleg copy",Cannot wait for this movie to be released in DVD format. My VHS tape arrived quickly and in good order. This is a great story about making ends meet and following your bliss. Richard Farnsworth plays a character that reminds me so of my own kin.
4,"Great story, super scenery, and Farnsworth's performance !","Richard Farnsworth gives a quiet, yet very compelling performance as a man who re-enters a very changed world after years in prison. Stunning Pacific Northwest scenery serves as a backdrop for this story of an aging robber who finds he must return to his old ""profession."" In short, this is a great movie I'm looking forward to ordering when it becomes available again."
5,Beautifully intelligent films like this are hard to come by,"Our copy of ""The Grey Fox"" is currently on loan to friends in Nashville. No one can find this movie and MANY people want to see it again and again. Ours spends half its time in the mail! The direction/cinematography by Phillip Borsos is breathtaking and Richard Farnsworth's performance as former stagecoach robber Bill Minor is a masterpiece of wit, deviltry and integrity. Farnsworth's snowy mustache has more nuance than most actors have in their entire bodies. The older gentleman's admiration of and romance with the older lady suffragette is a delight. The train footage alone is worth the cost of the tape. Please put in on the market."
5,"A wonderful, honest and beautiful movie for all","This movie is always in my Top 5 list. A beautiful movie to see, with characters you care about and a wonderful soundtrack from The Chieftains. It is the story of an honorable man (although a gentleman bandit) imprisoned and released at the turn of the century into a world he no longer understands and his love of a woman who is trying to break the constraints society has placed on the 'weaker sex'. I'm sorry this is not available as my copy is failing."
5,The Grey Fox,It arrived in excellent condition and in a timely fashion. We have already watched it and it works perfectly. Thank you...
2,grey fox movie from Nicksknack books,"I have been wanting to own this movie for quite some time and the movie is a really good one. The copy which I received is in poor condition and doesn't play cleanly. For that, I am dissatisfied."
5,Appeal to Criterion,I have written The Criterion Collection to consider reviving this beautiful classic in Blu-Ray. They are currently releasing 'Dazed and Confused' so if they have time for that they certainly can find the time to bring this classic back to life.Please join me in a letter-writing campaign and appeal to Criterion. Thanks!
2,Departure is good but wait for subbed,If you really like american DBZ you can buy it if you want. I would wait for the subtitles. This DVD has three eppisodes. If you are new to dbz this eppisode tells everyone their names... for example I am Vegeta supreim ruler of the universe and you can't defeat the great Yajerobi. The eppisodes are after they defeat Vegeta and again it's good if you love american DBZ but I don't.
4,Great intro to open G and open D,"This might be the best place for someone to start learning how to play a blues, rag style in the open tunings. There is nothing too difficult here and a lot of what is here doesn't even require a slide. I really got this to learn the Jimmy Murphy song that Book plays -- ""Electricity."" It's really not very difficult, and I picked it up in short order and have also learned some other tunes and the fundamental moves in both open G and open D.I'd always been a standard tuning player, but ever since I've gotten a digital clip-on tuner, I've been more willing to experiment with other tunings. For a finger-picker that wants to do add some open tuned songs, this is a good place to start. If you want something more slide-oriented and advanced or to sound like Muddy Waters, I'd recommend something by Bob Brozman."
2,If only life for most people was so easy.....,"Mr. Epstein obviously has bushels of cash, and plenty of connections with the glitterati. His descriptions of buying a place in Rome, going to dinner parties with his famous personal friends, and his perceptions of la bella figura, etc. are all rather patronizing. While I did enjoy a couple of the chapters, I found that Mr. Epstein's reality in the USA was obviously far different from mine, and so is his reality in Italy. Must be nice to have it all so easy."
5,"Explains the Unexplainable, but Has a Side Effect","I love Rome, yet when people have asked me exactly what it is I love about it, I've never been able to explain adequately. I'd come up with answers like, ""I don't know, it has a certain pace of its own"", or, ""It's sort of a combination of New York City and Havana"", or, ""The food..."" Well, Alan Epstein expresses the reasons beautifully. Unfortunately, the book has a side effect- if you've been to Rome, it makes you want to return-NOW, and if you've not yet been to Rome, it makes you want go- NOW. Oh, also- the chapters about food will make you hungry."
2,Pretty pedestrian effort,"I found this book very disappointing - trite, cliched ""insights"" into Rome and the Romans. Also, it was quite repetitive, in the manner of the self-help books he writes. He also has that self-help authorial style in that he believes all his observations have the force of revelation. The only good point is that he didn't seem as condescending to ""the Italians"" as Frances Mayes.Like another reviewer here, I had many questions that were left unanswered. I wanted to know more about his sons' experience; what language did they converse in day to day at home. Was Italian becoming their first language? Did they feel more Italian than American?I'm donating this book to my local library."
3,as the romans probably don't do,"A little put off by the fact that the author has written some perhaps less than inspirational self-help books, I often found myself wishing for more ""flouishes"" in the writing. It reads rather dryly for a book about such a vibrant city. His love for Rome only comes through occasionally. I could have used less about the ""erotic encounters"" he's had with Roman woman on the street and more about what it was like to make the transition moving from California to Rome. How long did it take for his wife to learn Italian? What were some of the other amusing (in hindsight) and challenging tales of adjusting to the Roman lifestyle? At times the book went in this direction, and then would go more in a tour guide direction and seemed unable to commit to either."
2,YEAH RIGHT! Dream on whoever wrote 'My most favorite meygan',"Myscene is good clean fun.Bratz are;EVIL,UGLY,HOME-LESS,FROWNING,GOTH (SOME ARE),SKINNY NINNIES,BIG HEADS!(My myscene got put up to a bratz doll and the bratz head was bigger!!!Myscene have longer bodies!!! Back to my list...;wire-haired,snotty,bad examples,naughty,VERY evil,mean,wine drinking twelve year olds!!! (Look at the limo's accesories and you will see a fancy cup filled with red wine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,wahh!!!! too ugly,"whose stupid idea was this?! Her lipstick is too bright and although is hair is a little too reddish, her hair is probably her best feature. Otherwise, her clothes are ugly and they're too tight. You might say she looks sexy but her clothes make her the opposite- HORNY!!!!!! UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUggly"
1,An expensive book at half the price,"OK, watch carefully:I have in my hand a collection of short stories, and an appalling ""metaphor"" about a magician teaching his apprentice how to tell stories that is about 99% padding -Now, I cover my hand with this brightly coloured hankerchief -I mutter the magic words: ""Never give a sucker an even break"" -I remove the hankerchief and Presto! a rather expensive book has appeared (expensive for what it is).If you're interested in how to construct metaphors I'd recommend Kostere & Malatesta's book ""Get the Results You Want"" (last chapter), and if you want a book of useful/entertaining stories, almost anything by Idries Shah, such as 'Tales of the Dervishes' and 'Learning How to Learn'. They're all significantly cheaper than this book, and much better value for money."
1,For storytellers,A very nice resorce for those who want to be talented storytellers.It helps with hints and stories.
4,thanks,"This beatiful music is a combination of powerful and refreshing, soothing and calming. Every time I listen to these songs it gives me new energy. It cheers me up and gives me hope wenn I need it; it reminds me of the right way to go. With the melody in my mind every day is full of sunshine. Thanks!"
4,size may apper different than what u see,it's a great patch but it's way smaller than what i thought. i'd say it's about two inches tall or across or whatever. it's still kool though.
1,Not what I thoight it would be.,"It is not worth buying this item, the size of this item is about 1'.5"", not what like the picture is shown on here. I would tell you to save your money,unless you like small and cute."
3,"Not my cup o' tea, honestly","This one didn't really do it for me and was just ""okay"" in the end. The writing is very descriptive, but...I found the narrative voice kind of weird. While I don't necessarily expect historical accuracy, there were just times it read more as a late-1800s European historical than the set-in-1757 colonial America story that it purports to be.The characters were decent and Rafe is a tortured hero, but I didn't really latch onto them and feel an emotional investment in their HEA.This book also has anklebiters (Charity's twin boys), and I honestly cannot stand bratty kids in romance novels."
3,The cards are pretty.,"I have this. The cards are pretty and fun to use, but the book that explains their meanings is a little...vague. Somehow all of the meanings seem alike to me. Other definitions that I've read are a bit more specific and a little more paganish. The book does give directions though and that's nice."
3,For Ecelectic Pagans,"If you are a searcher and need counsel, this book by Ralph Blum is for you. The beautiful cards and verses offer insight and wisdom. Ralph Blum connects the Runes with other traditions to form a whole for Christians and Ecelectic Pagans. For example, he has the Medicine Wheel Spread to connect with your mental, spiritual, physical, emotional selves on different levels.However,if you are looking for an indepth study of the Runes and the Norse Gods, this book is not for you. Ralph Blum has his own version of the Elder Futhark. He also divorces the culture surrounding the Runes from the Runes themselves."
1,Old & simplistic view of SWAT tactics by a low-budget dept.,"Although it doesn't seem like a long time ago, SWAT tactics and equipment has changed a lot since the early 1990s. This video was filmed back then and it just doesn't have a professional appearance. For about 5+ minutes in the film, there are a couple SWAT officers doing a ridiculous song and dance that makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. What is that about? Also, the PD that is modeled in this film appears to me to be a mickey mouse department. Their tactics don't make sense (such as entering with SMGs at the hip!). Use your money on SWAT Team by Hans Halberstadt."
2,Haven't felt the effects yet,My mother recommended that I try Royal Jelly. Not this brand but to try the product in general. Supposedly it works wonders fo arthritis pain and other ailments. And I know other people have felt the effects of this product but i haven't. I will say the taste isn't bad and it looks like regular honey but other than satisfying your sweet tooth i don't see the benefit of this product.
3,2 different cases,"i receive my cases in about 5 day. typical time. big problem is they sent me 2 different cases. both odyssey, both for 1200s but 1 has the feature to lock it with a padlock and the other doesn't. pretty bad shipping/quality control if you ask me. i believe a previous buyer had the same experience"
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I purchased this movie for my niece, a Robert Beltran fan, and, despite not normally liking this sort of movie, fell in love. This movie is not just for Latinos it is for everyone. It shows how alike humans really are regardless of ethnicity, religion and, to some extent, up bringing. The special features, especially the director's commentary, are a real bonus and well worth watching."
1,muchisimos ceros a la izquierda,"Desde el inicio de este simulacro filmico, me decepcionaron, la indisponibilidad de una pista en castellano, la superficialidad y baratez de las protagonistas y por ultimo, el final feliz para todos, cosa architipica del cine gringo pero poco frecuente entre los hispanos de verdad, quienes suelen maliciar que la verdad puede ser triste, y la felicidad pasajera. Al escuchar los comentarios de las mujeres, recien despues de empezar la proyeccion, me dije ""Ahi me veo confirmado nuevamente ese dicho de 'Mas vale solo que mal acompanado'"". Indigna de ver. He dicho."
4,Great Latinas,Great characterizations of Latinas in today modern world of high pressure jobs and high demanding relationships. The feature combines them both along with the longstanding inner struggle with Latina indentity and male machismo. It hit the nail on the head. Admirable script and characters not to mention the quality of actors.Great job guys.
3,Latino Chick Flick?,"Scott Bakula guest stars as the ""white"" Jewish heart throbin an East LA Mexican movie about women between cultures.The idea is there are these four educated Mexican girlswho have reached near middle age in LA. Most are relatively successful in their careers,but are having some problems in their love lives.One is a train wreck artist who has very little luck with menand gets drunk every time things go south on her.One is a psychologist who hasn't yet adapted to being a professionalin a blue collar Mexican world.One is a fashion designer who makes hip Mexican-American fashions.The last best hero is a divorce lawyer who handles cases for abused Mexican women.When her marriage goes on the rocks, things heat up.This movie portrays Latino women in LA as kind of loose.Anyone believing that is about to be disappointed?I liked it as bad as the picture of Mexicans is in the moviebecause it was kind of funny in a head bashing way."
1,lousy and lousy performance,"I would give the movie 0.5 star. The performance was totally totally beyond bad. They just seem that they cannot act at all period. To call it a hispanic version of ""waiting to exhale"" is a total misnomer b.c ""waiting to exhale"" has a great content and great cast members while this one has interesting ideas but horrific 4 latina actresses to exeute the movie. Totally waste of my time. I would never recommend anyone to rent this movie."
1,Rascist Waste of Time,"This movie was so rascist against whites. The author has this ""rage"" within her. What a joke. White people are not responsible for the problems of Hispanics. Creepy film!"
4,War in the Air: Fighting Planes and Pilots in Action,"Satisfied with both price and delivery. Hoped for ""Dust Cover"" but not there. Would like other books inseries but not in Title page."
3,Pretty but not practical.,"I was expecting a little more support from this bra. However, it is sexy and feels like I'm not wearing a bra. Very comfortable."
3,"The ""Why"" is evident, but not the ""How""","Harold Bloom has specific tastes he makes known throughout this book. One example: ""Yet Maupassant is the best of the really ""popular"" story-writers, vastly superior to O. Henry (who could be quite good) and greatly preferable to the abominable Poe.""This is book of literary criticism, of ""why"" one should read certain authors and not others. It would greatly benefit readers to read the stories/plays/novels Mr. Bloom examines, because key plot points and endings are discussed. A theme throughout this book is how literature can improve the character of a person who reads it and grasps its meaning. This would preclude reading purely for enjoyment, which, in my opinion, can be ascribed to time-honored literature as well as popular fiction, and should be the initial step toward encouraging a fondness for reading. While this book represents ""why"" (and ""what"") to read, if you're truly interested in ""how"" to read, I recommend Understanding Fiction by Brooks and Warren."
1,A Blooming Waste,"I'm not much of a reviewer, but I do know how to warn people. If you get this book you will not find out how to read a book, you will not find out why to read a book, you will learn more than you want to know about the random blathering of an outdated, self-absorbed, academic eunich. The book appears to be Professor Bloom's chance to espouse every opinion he ever had and espouse them as gospel requiring no proof or support. He tells me that I should read to discover myself, then he gives a bunch of plot summaries and oblique references to Chekov or Borges. I don't know if I found myself in this book, but I came to my senses after about 80 pages."
4,It's certainly how I read and why,"It's not that I think the arguements of those who hate this book are wrong, it's just that I drew something entirely different, and valuable, from this book. I'm thrilled when Bloom expresses more exactly than I can why I read. He champions the aesthetic appreciation of literature, a search for ""transcendence of limits"" (Western Canon), rather than treating literature as of value only as an ideological tool or a self-help program. The second reason I appreciate this book is because Bloom inspired me to read several works I wouldn't have read otherwise. For an introduction to The Crying of Lot 49, Miss Lonelyhearts, and the astounding Blood Meridian, I will always thank him."
3,Why read this book?,"Don't be deceived by the benign and clever title of this book.I heard Mr. Bloom interviewed about the book on a PBS program and he is certainly an erudite scholar, it would seem. This book, however is not for the faint of heart. My guess is the average college educated reader who does something else for a living than teach a graduate course in literature will find this book too much. It is certainly written for the academics or Ph.Ds with more than a passing knowledge of the authors mentioned. I must say I did not or could not read the book entirely. Reader and buyer beware."
4,Master at Work...,"Good book, if I had written it - it would have been a great book. But the expectations for Bloom are so high. Everything he writes is worth the effort. It is a better outline of what to read, than how or why. Shakespeare is in a dimension beyond the rest of us, if you realize that now, then some of the book will be redundant. I've read this book twice and got those books he recommended that I didn't have, so that is the finest compliment you can give any book."
3,Developing one's approach to reading,"It's difficult to imagine that there would be a universal answers to the queries ""How to Read and Why?"" as different people have different approaches to books, and the approach taken by one may not appeal to other. Still, if one reads and becomes a little better for it, the activity has been worthwhile. By giving examples of novels, short stories and plays and his own approach to them, Bloom is attempting to stimulate others to delve into the worldwide reading. One might not agree in every case with his approach to the various literary pieces he discusses, but his overall attempt is laudable. If people get into the reading mode after going through this book, he has an achievement under his belt. Some might mimic his mode of reading and reflecting at first, but as the habit is formed, it is inevitable that they build their own unique approach."
3,Frustrating read,"I am an obsessive reader, like Bloom. I share his concern for the future of reading, but found this book rather heavy-handed and platitudinous--though I wouldn't dismiss anyone who loved it either. The problem for me is that Bloom never stops to develop his insights in a useful way; the approach is scatter shot and the tone pretentious. If your mind works the same way Bloom's does and you love reading, by all means dig in. If not, caveat emptor."
2,Why you can read Shakespeare and skip the rest,"This book is a prime example of the Emperor not having any clothes. If you read this book not knowing who the author was, you would throw it across the room in irritation: enough about Shakespeare, when are you going to talk about the novel (play, poem, etc) under discussion. When are you going to stop making emphatic superlative statements and then refuse to back them up with any evidence? When are you going to supply some evidence for any of your opinions and not expect the reader to take it on faith because so august a critic is saying it? (For this part, I guess you WOULD have to know the author).Probably the most annoying and egocentric book of lit crit I have ever read, saved somewhat by its brevity. Only the section on the Romantic poets was useful. As for the rest, might as well take Bloom's advice and read Shakespeare instead. Reading this book is a waste of time (and money)."
1,How to Read and Why,"Please do not waste your money on this book. Each section is devoted ostensibly to a ""critique"" of a work that Mr. Bloom recommends to his unwashed readers. The sections are actually synopses posing as critiques. Furthermore, any critical comments Mr. Bloom does offer are sufficiently esoteric to be useful only to those already tutored in the study of literature. A better title for this book would have been How Best to Earn Money While Resting on Your Laurels."
5,Excellant cushioning shoe,I have run in Asics for years. I have been very happy with this line of shoe. They are light weight and well cushioned for the runner that needs cushioning. I run distances of anywhere from 3 miles to 26.2 in these shoes.
3,"Item is pretty, but....","It's advertised as a Swarovski product, but there is no Swarovski marking anywhere on it as required for their products."
4,GREAT!!!,"This DVD should be great. I'm going to buy it for the extras alone and the actual video part is an added bonus. Some of the extras are his first match in the WWF, (rumored) his favorite match which may be Ricky Steamboat v. Ric Flair, a never before aired MadTV sketch and more. If you are a fan of the WWF then you have to get this DVD in 9 days when it comes out."
1,Triple H-RAW Hog,"Blah. Get this DVD only for the classic Steamboat vs. Savage match. That's it. HHH is a time hogging .... There is no wrestler he can't hold down. You nake them, he's held them down. The one word this man lacks in his vocabulary is JOB. He better start jobbing or he will lose his JOB. Wait, no he can't. He is ... Stephanie. My bad."
2,"If you like being worked, this is the DVD for you","This DVD is less a history and more a snowjob. NOthing is said about HHH's manipulations of the backstage goings-on, his squashing of young talent and his need for the spotlight above even the health of the company.I would stay away from this unless you like being worked."
5,Info,The reason WWE and ShopZone.com have not endorsed nor advertised this DVD is because it has yet to be released...notice it says June 25th!
1,HHH is the lame-uh,"This video/DVD is basically just Triple-H exercising his backstage power to stroke his massive ego. Various superstars get interviewed, and they all say that HHH is the best wrestler ever. We see HHH beating some wrestlers, while everyone tells us how cool he is. We see him posing and spitting water.....reality check:HHH is a talentless, boring egomaniac who only has such a massive push because he's sleeping with the boss's daughter. If it wasn't for that fact, he would NEVER be anything more than a JTTS, and we would never have to be insulted with video releases like this garbage. Oh yeah, Flair-Steamboat? Break out the pillows and blankets for that one......"
3,LET THE GAME BEGIN!,"This DVD is pretty good. The DVD special features feature HHH Vs. Buck Zumhoff where HHH does a diamond cutter as his finisher! The TEST/ Steph marriage, Royal Rumble 2000 commentary, and Flair/ Steamboat from 1989 (HHH's Favorite match.) The actually DVD is fun to watch as it mainly covers his 2000 Heel run through Wrestlemania X8. There's also a easter egg when you push right on working heel as it shows why he uses the sludgehammer. Recomended for the special features."
3,Interesting but not worth the money!,"Having seen a couple other tapes from stars of WWE. I can honestly this one wasn't that great. While I do think there was a lot of footage of Triple H's beginning in the wrestling world, and his quad injury it really didn't go into who Triple H was before he became Triple H. There was no background other him mentioning how he watched wrestling with his father as he grew up. After seeing tapes from Undertaker and the Hardy Boyz I expected something much better than that. On the flip side though there was some great footage of Triple H coming back from his quad injury so it was interesting. But, other than that I'd say save yourself the money and don't bother buying this tape."
4,True Story,I enjoyed reading this true story but would have liked to see an update on the mother and where she is now.
5,An engrossing story,"A short way into A Mother's Trial, I put it down fearing that the subject matter would be too depressing. I picked the book up again a few days later and ended up being totally engrossed in the story.Nancy Wright's writing style reflects the best of the journalistic tradition: straightforward, unpretentious and thorough. She lays out the facts leading up to the trial and lets them tell their own story - and a damning story it is! At this point, the reader has little doubt of the mother's guilt. Yet, in the course of the trial, as seen from multiple points of view, doubts do arise. This is a very balanced account, attempting to fairly present both sides.Insights into the perceptions and emotions of those involved complement the factual narrative. The book does a particularly good job of portraying the emotional conflicts of the medical professionals as their admiration turns reluctantly into suspicion.All in all - a very good read."
3,Interesting enough to finish but poorly written.,"The book was interesting since it was a true story, but it was poorly written. It also lacked an ending."
2,Hard to finish,Started out okay but got weighed down with all the medical terms. The only way I could finish it was to skip to the end.
5,Well-Written and Intense,"I was unfamiliar with the case of Priscilla Phillips, but after reading Nancy Wright's extremely well-written book I felt like I had lived through the experience. The intensity of emotion -- from Priscilla's and the doctors' worry for the kids to everyone involved's worry about the outcome to my own stress about the ""what if I were in that situation?"" -- meant I couldn't stop thinking about the story, even when I couldn't get to the Kindle to read! I do wish the epilogue had followed up with the family to a more recent time, to see how everyone fared, but that's just being nosy...I will look for more books by Nancy Wright!"
3,"Interesting, but a little over- detailed in places.","I'm glad I read this book as the story itself is intriguing. The only thing I would have changed if I was the editor would have been to leave out some of the inconsequential details that tend to make it drag in places. Turning the pages to the good bits achieved the same thing, I guess. Worth reading if you like true medical stuff combined with a good dose of crime."
5,Mothers who kill,Nancy Wright does an excellent job of bringing in all people involved in this true story. She writes about their feelings and really pulls you into the story. She doesn't stop at the trial and verdict but continues on thru the appeals. A very complete story that is very well written.
5,"Engrossing Story, Well Written",I think the author did an exellent job covering this complex story from all angles. It is so sad that a mother could do things like this to a little baby. How her husbond could stand behind her is beyond me.
5,Very compelling story,"I am a big fan of true crime and this book didn't disappoint. It was a very complex case - to investigate, take to trial and write about. The author did a superb job. Thank goodness for the doctors, the district attorney's office and the detective, Ted, for their thoroughness. They just went where the facts led them. I had no problem believing the guilt of the mother. I was unfamiliar with this case and having read about it, I doubt I'll ever forget it. My heart goes out to little Tia who suffered and died unnecessarily and all the other children who have been victims of lethal mothers."
2,Ready for your hate,"Okay, I am not an idiot. I can read and understand a book. I do ER billing. This book should not be ordered unless you are really into reading technical results of labs and a sad and slightly boring story. Munchausen is a really interesting topic but this book just didn't do it for me. I am sorry for mom and her seemingly adorable little girls. I just found the book unreadable. No pics in my edition. I would have loved to see Sara Shimoda, MD. I felt like I was at work the entire time. The book was work. Not recommended. I think ""Sickened"" was a much better book on this strange subject."
3,Unfinished,"I feel as though the book finished without a final diagnosis of Mrs Phillips, was she released and when, did she try this again."
2,Unnecessary Swearing,"Although the beginning of the book showed promise, the language was not appropriate for the story line. I would not recommend this book."
1,Written like he was being chased by a T-34,"One of the worst pieces of writing I've seen since gradeschool. Kershaw repeats phrases and quotes repeatedly. Often, he'll quote some soldier's account, then, later, use the same quote as a sub-chapter title, and still later, have the quote again as a caption to a photograph. And don't get me started on the photographs! He says most of the photos are from his own collection. Well, he should have kept his collection to himself. These are some of the worst taken pictures I've seen, so grainy that they must have been blow-ups from microscopic negatives. The only useful data was the statistical information he provides on combat unit attrition. Now, I'm off to find the source of his statistical information - that would be worth reading!"
3,I have a couple of problems here,"Most books on the Great Patriotic War (like John Erickson's venerated 'Roads' and David Glantz's excellent books) give this theater a dull and scholarly read as most of the participants were either killed or taken prisoner. Robert Kershaw's book provides an excellent read like Stephen Ambrose and Gerald Astor's books have shown. But just why did he spell Russian names in a German way like 'Dmitrij Wolkogonow', 'Jaroslav Hawrych', etc. He also makes the mistake of equalling Soviet atrocities with Nazi atrocities. If one really looks at the figures, he can see that the Germans overshadowed any atrocities the Soviets commited on them. The Soviets were notorious for making their own people suffer not the Germans."
5,"""Kein Blumenkrieg""","While not offering any new or startling revelations concerning the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Kershaw draws on the words and images of the individual, common soldier to illustrate the mounting horror of a campaign doomed from the outset. The result is a masterpiece of the common man, a celebration of war from the perspective of the simple soldier, the view from the blood-soaked mud of the battlefield.For readers in search of a serious study of the effects of war on the human psyche, the Kershaw's masterpiece will satisfy your curiosity. This is an analysis of the influence of war on the human condition. For the reader truly interested in the human domain of war, this is a worthwhile purchase."
5,The Quest of the Golden World,"Robert Johnson has been a great teacher, mentor, and inspiration for many in the exploration of the inner world, and ultimately the discovery for what he has known as 'the golden world'.It is a homecoming and a place of bliss and repose. I had the privilege to study and share time with Robert in the U.S. and India. He provided for me a taste of that world and a living inspiration in the very real possibility of developing a sacred and blissful rapport between the inner and outer worlds we inhabit. I was delighted to find in this book my own tiny contribution in suggesting to Robert that he take a polaroid camera to India. The realm of Enlightenment is the destiny of all humanity, and here is the humble story of one man who is pointing for us the way to follow... if we are willing to find the courage to do so."
5,Possibly the best work in Johnson's compendium.,"As a student of depth psychology, particularly Jungian, I have read all of Johnson's work and this most personal work is the one that has affected me the most deeply. By revealing the details of his life's journey, Johnson gives the reader insight into how it looks to ""follow your bliss."" Sometimes the call we receive is not an easy one and Johnson poignantly shares his struggles with this as well. But remaning true to the ""still small voice"" and allowing his ego to be used in service to the Self (God) has resulted in a life that is both rich in texture and joyful in experience. This book is a treasure and one to be savored at that!"
5,An amazing and brilliant gift to the senses,What an amazing concert. I have played it over and over again and each time the music and lyrics send me spiraling into ecstacy. It is nothing less than pure joy.
4,Something Got Me Started!,"Simply Red's album, ""Stars,"" was their fourth or fifth album. ""Stars"" is a wonderful addition with Mick Hucknall as the front man and red-headed guy who is unforgettable by appearance and sound. Simply Red is an acquired taste.I do like Simply Red and I love the British sound of the 1980s. It was the sound that I grew up with in America and the MTV generation when music videos were not only made but shown. Simply Red never made music about silly love songs but deep issues about reality and the world itself."
5,Super plyta- polecam!,"Przepiekna plyta na pewno kazdy kochajacy muzyke facet znajdzie w niej mnostwo ciepla, piekna, techniki spiewu, doskonalego basu i faceta co jest artysta."
4,10 minute solution,"The pace of the program is good for beginners. Past 60 and in reasonably good shape I found exercises manageable, getting up and down from the floor is required. It would have been nice to have a 10 minutes segment using hand weights in this collection. The 10 minute segments can be combined to create longer session."
4,Pilates for Beginners,"I really like the 10 minute format, you can select the workouts you want to do that day and keep your workouts varied. I am not the most flexible person so this beginners pilates workout is challenging for me while I try to gain more strenght."
5,Great For Beginners,"This video was great for beginners. She does not use a lot of confusing terminology and it is not to hard. Although, it is something you must work up to. I usually do what I can, push myself a little and then take a break for a second if I need to. There are five sections, core, upper body, lower body, all three put together, and stretching. I usually do one of the first three, then the total body combo, and then stretch. It works out perfect because you can pick the length of your excercise-in ten minute increments, and you can pick what you want to work on. I would definitely recommend this video!"
5,Excellent Diaper Bag,"This diaper bag is the best i've seen. It has plenty of room to put everything you need. No need to carry your purse anymore. It has a place to put all your credit cards, ids, and keys. This is absolutely a great diaper bag. It deserves a 5 stars!"
3,Not enough room,"We bought this because it matched our stroller. It isn't that roomy, and there aren't enough small pockets for ointments, medicine, etc.. Within four months we bought another ""cheapie"" bag to make due with and are searching for a better bag.Also, the fabric along the zipper broke within a couple of weeks. Not a good purchase all and all."
4,"does its job, but works poorly with large books",I found that if I put a large book on it the plastic support (which folds out and moves so you can adjust the angle) would bend as it is made of rather thin plastic. I use a picture frame right behind it to hold the weight of heavier books.
4,"Nice product, very useful","Been very nice having this on my desk at work. Makes working with any type of reading material a pleasure. I was a little hesitant as it is totally made of plastic, but holds the 4"" book--- no problem.I bought 2 additional ones for my kids...so that says it all.Only 4 Stars Because:(1) It was a bit pricy(2) The band that holds the page down is useless as it bisects the middle of the page you are reading and I found it very distracting, so I just don't use it."
5,indispensible,i used this stand extensively in med school. its amazing. it can handle a large textbook no problem. you can adjust the angle until its just right. it even works as a clipboard also. good stuff
3,About Wacky Races.,"Wacky Races gets a bit boring after a while.2racers are missing,they are Professer Pat Pending and a farmer with his pet bear in a tractor like car.<I cannot remember his name.>There should be some shortcuts and more traps,but overall the game is okay."
1,not what it says it is!,if i could give this zero stars i would! it says it fits the bissel power force model #6579-3 when it clearly does not!
5,Glad these are available online,Glad that we could purchase these. Great to have them on hand when needed. Very convenient and useful. Will order these again!
1,Didn't fit.,It's the right style for my Bissell vacuum but would not fit into my 5+ year old machine. Maybe it fits newer models.
4,Works fine,Got these to replace old filters and they work fine. Arrived fast and was just as described in the ad. I am pleased with purchase.
3,Circular Filter not compatible with Bissell Powerforce Bagless,Every filter but the pleated circular filter fits perfectly. The pleated filter is missing the raised base in shown in the picture.
2,"Great content, hard to read","Poe was a genius...no doubt about that. This is a great collection of his work.But....the typeface in this book is incredibly hard to read! The font is too fat, or something...making it hard to see what the words actually say. It hurts my eyes to read this. I would buy another book of Poe's works that is easier to see."
5,An excellent film set in the confusing aftermath of WWII,"This is an atmospheric drama set in the stark ruins of Berlin after World War II. It has richly nuanced characters, a tight plot and is beautifully filmed in black and white. It is one of the few movies I saw as a child which stuck with me all these years and on seeing it again, I was just as enthralled."
5,How beautiful!!!!,"I really Love this bracelet, I Can't wait to wear it out. I just ordered three more for friends. Thanks Cool!"
2,Boring,"This game was horrible. The only reason why I rated it with 2 stars is because of the graphics and sound. I owned the game for about 2 whole hours, before returning it. I played it for five minutes. I guess I thought it would be like the FIFA games made by EA Sports. Also, the teams are not actual teams and the controling of the players is horrible making this altogether a boring game which is'nt worth spending your money on unless your some sort of die-hard soccer fan."
3,Very Impressive,The game is a perfect example of Dreamcasts Powers. Wow! I'm gonna go play it now it is the best game out today
3,not the clearest teaching,"Watching this is like sitting down with a friend who plays well and occasionally slows down to let you try and see or sound out what he's doing. Mo's hands are not particularly easy to read, neither he nor his assistant stop to mention which strings he's playing on, it's impossible to see, and the company that makes the DVD doesn't bother to superimpose any fret diagrams--even amateurs teaching on youtube will often do that. I love Mo's music, and I am learning from this, but without the booklet that comes with it, the DVD would be not much help, so don't buy a version without that. In fact, the booklet by itself would be nearly as useful as the whole DVD. Not the best value. I'm charmed to learn Perpetual Blues Machine and to jam along with Mo, but not so charmed I'd recommend purchasing this DVD to anyone."
5,Great self-help book!,"If you want to change your life for better, then read this book. Girls' bible. Wonderful self-help book, easy and fun to read."
5,A Guide That Reveals and Inspires,"After reading this book I was able to at last comprehend what exactly goes on in a man's head and how women carry around a 'social microchip' that obstructs them from achieving the same levels of success in the world. Stefano Spadoni's work not only reveals truths about dating and loving in the modern world, it also offers advice and guidance on fulfilling your ultimate desires. I would recommend it without hesitation to all those looking for answers to their relationship questions and solutions to their problems of achieveing success."
2,not the greatest book.,not great. interesting but not what i was hoping for as far as insight into the man and the murders. the story actually tells nothing about the man or his motives. disappointing.
2,"I thought it was ""ok""","This book was ""ok"" I thought that they dragged it out, and didn't get into full detail of how the murders happened and what happened to the men that got killed. They could have went into a little more detail"
2,"For a guy who likes to complain about language,",He should complain about the verbosity of his own book. Complaints without any real solutions. Almost stopped reading this multiple times.
4,Required reading for Democrats,"Let's face it: Neo-Conservatives are smarter. They have been successful because they get their point across more directly to the American people. Conservative philosophy is based on several easy to understand principles:It was better in the good old days.People who are different are dangerous.New ideas are evil.You are either with us or against us.The Neo-Cons have been able to successfully cover their incompetence, their dishonesty, their greed, and their hypocricy with simple negative names for their enemies and positive phrases for their policies. These neatly fit into sound-bites and bumper stickers. Nunberg shows you how they do it in his aptly named book. The title sums up the message. The ordinary person doesn't need to read it, but I hope Democratic politicians all do.I'm not sure that Liberal ideals can ever be dumbed down to simple prases, but knowledge is power.The only phrased I can think of for the upcoming (Nov 2006) election is:""Had enough?"
5,The Sound of One Hand Clapping,"We swim through words like fish swim through water. Metaphors are accepted as reality by many. Legends become gospil truth. This books was an informative and fun view at a very important (not just politically) subject. And now, at last, I know where the word ""pinko"" came from and what it means."
4,"Nice watch, but not for a small wrist","This is a very nice watch, but was much too big for my small wrist. I needed a bangle watch which is adjustable. If the size had not been a problem, I would have kept this watch, but had to return it, unfortunately."
4,Classic book on Salesmanship,"This is what Stephen Covey refers to as the era of Character based achievement. This book promotes a solid physical, spiritual and mental based upon which your HARD WORK (yes, two four letter words) must be based upon to achieve real success. The graphic alone make this book worth the price. Nothing magic, but a graphical approach to help convey the need to BE a person of character before you can HAVE success."
1,This video is not really about the Shackleton expedition.,"If you are looking for a video with film and still photography from the original Shackleton expedition, keep looking. This video is really about a group of Irishmen who wanted to replicate the Shackleton expedition--and only the part at the end where Shackleton's crew sailed in a small boat from Elephant Island to South Georgia. To make it worse, they failed halfway there and wound up on a larger cruise ship the rest of the way to South Georgia, bemoaning their disappointment the whole way. After reading the account of the Shackleton expedition, I was hungry to see Hurley's film of that amazing journey. Imagine my disappointment to find out this video was, despite what the cover sleeve promised, nothing more than film of a relatively uneventful personal adventure which uses Shackleton's expedition more as an outline for the video's storyline than a reason to produce it in the first place."
2,Not enough Shackleton,"This film includes an interesting recreation by some Irish sailors who followed Shackleton's voyage. It was an odd combination of modern and historic information, not really satisfying on either count."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,After reading this book within a 24 hr period of time I am prompted to write my first book review ever. I love Greg Iles' books and this one was a quick paced unforgettable story. Couldn't put it down. I'm glad I was on my vacation when I decided to read it. Each chapter draws you more and more into the story and it becomes impossible not to finish at one reading.
4,There's A Lot to Like In This Book,"What we have here is a well-written thriller. Interestingly enough, it's written by a man presenting the story as a woman (photojournalist Jordan Glass)and using the first tense as the narrative form. There is a good mystery and a love story happening here. Like one of the previous reviewers, I think most of the book is rather well-done but, the ending and/or resolution of the mystery is rather contrived and unsatisfying. Mr. Iles also spends a lot of time discussing locations and the mechanics of getting to and from these locations. Things like the ride from the airport, what kind of vehicle was used and who was driving are totally unneccessary.All in all, I would recommend this book and look forward to reading some of the author's other works."
4,I liked the book right up to the end,"I really like this book, until the last two chapters. The ending just seemed to 'Scooby Doo-ish' for my taste. To me, it seemed like he could have done something different, a little more interesting. I didn't expect this book to have such a 'happy' and resolved ending like it did.This was the first book of the author's I have read, and if this book did one thing though, its made me at least want to check out his other works."
5,One hundred percent suspense,"This is the second book I have read of Mr. Iles. I am very glad to have found him,I will read all of his books in the future. He certainly has a way with his weaves and dodges in his novels. I can only highly recommend his books and will read them all in the following months."
4,A real page turner!,"This book was almost impossible to put down. It strained credibility from time to time and I took off a star because I found the ending a bit difficult to swallow, but it has enough twists and turns to keep the mind engaged. Iles is great at giving the book tension and a sense of urgency. This would be a great book to take on vacation where you don't have your life getting in the way of your reading."
2,Good first half - cliched and sicko ending,"I purchased this book because I like mysteries with female sleuths - and I enjoyed the first part of the book. It was a puzzler/thriller with the heroine and her FBI sidekick trying to find out who was painting the women and were the subjects really dead. The heroine is likeable and I enjoyed following her exploits.However, the second part of the the plotline devolves to your basic serial/psychotic killer story (I won't get anymore definite to avoid spoilers). I found the very end to be rather sickening and I was left with some images I would rather not have in my head.To sum up - a promising thriller with an interesting female protagonist becomes a horror novel with a creepy violence-against-women ending."
2,What a Disappointment,"You have got to be kidding. I wasted my time reading this one because this book received such good reviews.Yes, I think Greg Iles is an excellent writer. Twenty-four Hours was really exciting. However, I had to force myself to finish this one. I continued to read it because I thought it might get better.Save your time and money on Dead Sleep. You might just fall into a deep sleep while reading it."
2,This Book PUT Me To Sleep,"I tried and tried, but just could not finish this book. It is so incredibly boring , lacking any true suspense, I gave up. The female character is not interesting. The story drags. Where's the hook?The author writes in the first person as a woman. Weird!!! I did not like this book at all. I hope the next Iles' book is a whole lot better, or I will find a new author."
3,"GOOD, PAGE TURNER, INTRIGUING","A different type of story. Mr. Iles uses his imagination in this one. Some parts are a little ""corny"", but it is entertaining. I definitely wanted to see what happened. I would recommend this book to readers that enjoy mystery and suspense books. Not the best book on the market, but worth reading. If anyone has read Santa Fe Rules by James Wood or the Green Mile by Stephen King, these books, in my opinion, are five star books."
3,"Okay, but not his best!",I've read all of Mr Iles books and I think this is my least favorite. It just wasn't compelling enough to really pull me in and make me feel as if I had to know what was going to happen next. It seemed too redundant at times. The lady photojournalist just befriended some of the suspects to easily for me. Overall the story just fell flat. Still I consider him one of my favorite authors and look forward to his next novel.
5,"Not the best, but the best out there","Is anyone thinking that Greg Iles stands out there as one of the best authors we have? We wait with anticipation for each book and Dead Sleep won't disappoint Greg Iles fans. When photojournalist Jordan Glass see her 'glass' likeness in an art collection of nude ladies purported to be not sleeping, but dead, she goes on a treck to find an answer to the mystery of her twin sister's disappearance, and the disappearance of others in the New Orleans area. The story has all the elements of a masterful thriller, but what is lacking is the lyrical quality that has been present in Iles' previous books. Look up the ist paragraph chapter 25 of Quiet Game - those words touch the heart and take you upward. Dead Sleep keeps you in the here and now and solidly, not lyrically, takes you through a wonderfully plotted book. Not his best, but Greg Iles ranks tops out there."
2,Dead and Disappointing,"""Dead Sleep"" is a gripping murder-suspense-thriller that leaves you disappointed at the end. While I was addicted throughout the book to the story of the heroine, I was embarassed and mad at Mr. Iles for feeling like he had to tie up every loose-end possible at the end of the book. The story would have ended just fine with the heroine being saved. It's almost as if the ending was tacked-on at the last minute to satisfy the comments from a screening of the novel. I highly recommend buying this book used."
4,Good But Not Stunning,"I had no trouble getting into this book, read it in only two days, and enjoyed it quite a bit. However, in my opinion it isn't nearly as good as Mortal Fear. There were times when I forgot Jordan Glass wasn't a guy. I believe that it is possible for an author to write from the perspective of the opposite sex, but it isn't easy, and Greg Iles hasn't quite managed yet. However, I did enjoy it that he brought Baxter and Lenz back from Mortal Fear and that they had not changed character at all. Good carry over job. The ending was difficult to believe and left me with a lot of questions. In fact, I skipped several of the next-to-last chapters.All told, a good book. But if you really want to be blown away, read Mortal Fear."
4,Very Good,I really enjoyed this book. I like most of Greg Iles' books. However the ending of this one threw me. It was not a typical ending for him. I felt sorry for Jordan Glass because of the depth you get to know her. You feel her struggle with her twin's disappearance and the mystery of the paintings. The twists and turns weren't predictable but they were believable which is unusual for this type of book. I liked how he brought the FBI in and didn't make them buffoons. I enjoyed Jordan and John Kaiser's back and forth conversations. Although it's not very believable that the FBI would let a citizen be this closely involved in a high profile case. I would highly recommend this book to any Greg Iles' fans or anyone looking for a good suspense thriller.
4,Good read,"Keeps you intrigued til the end...what more could you want? Takes place in New Orleans, which is nice as well."
4,Dead Sleep,"I thought it was fast moving and challenging,in that you could not foretell the future of the story."
5,A super read,"Iles is masterful with this one. It is believable, complex and entertaining. I read it very quickly because I could not put it down. I eagerly await his next book."
2,Downhill slide for Iles,"Greg Iles first few books were well-researched, thought-out, and overall good reads. His last two, 24 Hours and Dead Sleep, have been disappointments. It appears he would now rather do little research or preparation and instead rush his books onto the market. I am hoping that in his next novel he will return to his earlier form."
4,New writer for me,"Not all of Greg Iles books seem to be available in the UK - this one isn't. I hope it does come soon.Greg is a new writer for me, and I was impressed. I'll have to read the other books in the series to see which of the other reviews is closest to the mark.Overall I was very impressed with the plotting and the action. A great point is that unlike a number of the ""thriller"" genre novels I have read the end is not short and sudden. This often manifests itself in the writer tidying up the loose ends at the end of the story very quickly so that the book seems to end very quickly.Why only four stars - well I'm not sure that any book really deserves five. I'd rate this alongside the other book I bought in the US recently - Total Recall by Sara Paretsky. Both recommended."
3,By-the-numbers mystery,"Or should I say, ""Paint-by-numbers""?I thought this was a fairly by-the-numbers story competently done. No flashes of brilliance or cleverness here, nor gasps of surprise. Still, a decent choice for the beach or the plane. It'll make a terrific Lifetime movie."
4,What a Plot!,The first chapter scared the life out of me. After that came the resolution of the conundrum. well done and a fun read.
5,ANOTHER 5 STAR PLUS BY ILES,"In short: Jordan Glass has a twin sister missing, possiblly dead. She helps the FBI solve the missing women being painted by an unknown artist. Read the book for the details. I don't know how he does it but Iles keeps you in suspense for over 450 pages wihout a killing or foul word on every page. His respect for women shows through the love scenes. His love of natural beauty comes throuh the characters' eyes. You know the characters as he takes the time to develop them and still keep you in suspense, never boring you. He doesn't blast you with a gorey scene on the first page. Instead, he gently seduces you into the plots and climaxes, inticing you into the big climax when you realize you have come to the end of the story, breathless with the final action. He is a master at this and I have enjoyed every one of his books so far and ready to read another one."
2,For Those Who Find 'Evil Dead' Too High-Concept...,"Erik Canuel, who directed (the quite good) ""Bon Cop, Bad Cop"", directs this TV pilot, masquerading as a feature film. As a film, it is GOD-AWFUL. As a TV pilot, it is slightly less than mediocre. The lead actor, Robert Bogue, seems to be attempting to channel Bruce Campbell with a raspy voice and dry wit. Unfortunately, he fails miserably, though to be fair, there is only one Bruce Campbell. One redeeming quality is the makeup effects. They are very well-done. Nearly everything else here is soggy and stale. The story is a hybrid of 'Constantine' and 'Captain America', featuring a government-designed, monster-hunting super-soldier frozen in time by his enemies for 50 years. If only this DVD had suffered the same fate..."
3,Not as good as I'd have hoped.,"Fried Green Tomatoes is a heart-warming story, but it's not a movie I'd watch more than once. One of the most annoying things about it was the fact that a lot of the story's points got mixed around.For instance, in the movie, it is strongly hinted at that Idgie Threadgoode and Ninny Threadgoode are the same person. THEY ARE NOT. Implying that she grows into Ninny is destructive to her character and confusing to the audience. When you think about it, how could Mrs. Threadgoode, wife of Cleo Threadgoode, have been Idgie, sister of Cleo and Buddy Threadgoode in her youth? The movie also glosses over Idgie and Ruth's relationship.The bottom line is this, if you want to experience this story fully, read the book."
4,Tearjerker - chick flick,"If you want a good cry this one will do it for you. Get the blankets, the tissues and popcorn and settle in for a good time the movie is well worth it. Good storyline. You'll laugh and cry, sometimes right after one another."
5,A movie for everyone,"Excellent story protrayed by a cast of fine actors. The story line wastouching, delivered with humor and tenderness. There is a lesson to be learned as the story unfolds, showing undying friendship, hardship, tragedy, and love. ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" is an unforgettable story leaving the audience wanting more."
3,Great Funny Sort of Lesbic Movie,Good movie to see w/ the family at night. About 2 hours long- but a good movie after all.
1,The ending rings false.,"This movie was entertaining up until the end, which I felt was totally unbelievable. It ruined the whole thing. I hate movies that let you down at the conclusion. It makes for a rotten feeling, like you've been betrayed. This, and another movie I can think of, ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"", left me with the same bad vibe. Lousy."
5,GREATEST MOVIE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY,"This movie 'DEPICTS"" what true friendship is all about. A must see for the entire family. Bet you can't watch it just once. It's a great movie."
5,Love it.,"Love it and great price too. Great Christmas Gift for my sister,she loves it too. Will order more DVD's."
5,ONE STAR REVIEWS,"Perhaps I am a pessimist, but I always check the one star reviews first before purchasing any product. The ones for this title ARE NOT EVEN FOR THIS PARTICULAR VERSION OF THE FILM!!!!!! Every prospective buyer beware! Such a classic film, and this is the definitive version! :)"
1,"5 stars for the movie, one for the dvd","Being a huge fan of the book and movie i bought this movie already having a regular copy of the movie because it said it was the extended version. i watched this movie carefully cause frankly i was excited to see the parts that they didnt show. It isnt extended. Not one scene and ive seen this movie like ten billion times and once just two days before and then i realised there was an extended version.This is the same movie as always, to the minuet.I have been one hundred percent ripped off."
5,Fried Green Tomatoes,"Very good movie, I missed it when it first came out, but always kept putting off ordering it. I am glad I finally did."
5,Jessica Tandy,"Love this cast. If you like Driving Miss Daisy, you'll love this one too. Kathy Bates is precious. One of my favorite appearances by Mary Stuart Masterson."
5,I'm a man and I love this movie!,"I often hear folks declaring this movie a ""chick flick"". Well, I'm all man and I think this is a great movie for everyone. There should be more movies like this one, full of interesting characters that make us fall in love with them. A storyline that keeps you watching from the very first scene to the grand finale. The interest never lets up and when I put this movie in the player, I make sure I have 2 hours to not be interupted because this movie holds all my attention until it ends. The scenery of the old South is magnificent and worth seeing just for that reason alone.Make sure to get the dvd that includes the ""making of"" as one it features. It's really interesting to see and hear about all the behind the scenes stuff."
5,must see movie,"I know this movie has been out for some time, I've watched it before, but it is the best. Cathy Bates is always wonderful whatever role she plays, love her on Harry's Law. All the actors are great. Loved this movie, should make more like this."
5,This movies is a real masterpiece!,"One of my English teachers showed us this video in the class. I remembered that we were really moved and since then I tell every friend of mine that this video is just great. I read the book last year and thought it was kinda different from the movie but also the book was very good. I give this video to my friends on thier birthday whenever I have a chance. I have learned how importnat the friendship is from this video. If you are wondering what you should give to your precious friend, simply get this video for her!"
5,Excellent,This movie i can watch it over and over again. Chic flick. All the stars in this moviecombine together were great. This is the best.
5,Fried Green Tomatoes,"This is a great story by Fannie Flagg. Its one I would like to believe is real, creates great emotions. I've read several of this authors books, this is one of her best stories. Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy are at their best."
5,"so funny, you'll be bent over laughing and drooling.","This movie might just be one of the better definitions of comedy. It is a bit sad, but the divine acting sure makes up for it. Seeing this movie does require being slightly mature, but it really isn't that rough. If you're hunting around the movie store for a good middle-of-the-night comedy, then this is your best bet. No question about it."
3,Disappointed!,I had never seen this movie and always had heard good things. I am sorry but I found it depressing and the underlying theme of two women attracted too each other was annoying. Either be truthful and up front or keep it out of the story. Totally sucked in my opinion. Sorry
1,boaring,"This is one of those movies that are too long. It is very dull and I kept wishing it was over. it is just an old lady telling a story of her life. You can get that by voulentearing at a nurseing home, but as a voulentear you will actually help someone who is lonley."
5,Best of thr best,"I love this movie when ever it came on tv I'd watch it no matter if I'd just seen it, I'd watch it again, so my husband says why don't you just buy the dvd. Boy am I gald I did the extended addition is better than I hoped it would be Great movie A classic if ever there was one."
3,Director Avnet gets a C-minus for ignoring lesbian subtext,"Fanny Flagg's novel, though intentionally or nor,portrayed a lesbian subtext relationship between Idgy and Ruth. Even though these heroines were never found between the sheets they definately had a romantic relationship. The book does a much better job at looking at this dynamic; two women who are devoted to each other beyond any other relationship. When, in the movie, the story hints at Ninny really being an older Idgy I was extremely disappointed. In the novel, Ninny is Idgy's sister-in-law; once being married to the eldest Threadgoode boy.They movie, however, does stand on its own as a good movie. However, I don't suggest reading the book first."
3,This DVD is NOT the Original Theatrical Release of the Film,"I loved ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" at the theater and the old VHS video version (which is the only version on which you can see the original theatrical release), but unfortunately, both DVD versions insert extra scenes which ruin some of the seemless transitions between flashbacks and present-time which were the hallmark of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"". The extra scenes aren't even particularly good, and this DVD provides no original version without them. This criticism is true for both the Widescreen Collector's Edition and the Anniversary Edition. I'm deeply disappointed, and hoping Universal will one day release the original theatrical version of the film on DVD. What a shame it would be for the theatrical version of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" to one day disappear."
4,Towanda! Towanda!,"The people in this movie show a lot of concern, also a great family movie after a hard days work! The distant love between Eggie and Ruth became very close,and so did her hired hands! Smokie a bomb off the streets Eggie showed him some love and concern and didn't look at the habit the grown on him, and as for Frank Bennet, I feel he got what he really desreve! I often wonder if they really made babaque from Frank Bennet's remains? (body) Sippes and Big Geroge also was a great part of the show! I rate the show 4 stars! If you have not watched the show please do so! What a laugh! Towanda! Towanda! Jessica Lange Was a Great storyleller, You would feel that you was right there! Enjoy the laughs!"
5,Awesome Movie,I love the movie Fried Green Tomatoes. It is one of the best movies if you like the old time setting. Old time movie settings are my favorite and this is one of my favorites. Jessica Tandy is one of the best movie actresses of all time. She is great and makes the movie worth watching it over and over.
5,Not just for Southern Belles!,"In my circle of friends and family Fried Green Tomatoes, Steel Magnolias, and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood are the three movies that we can go to any day of the week and get what we need from viewing it. Do you want to laugh? Do you want to cry? Do you want to see a guy get smacked? This movie is for you! AND it's the kind of movie a man can sit through and not be totally disgusted that he's watching a ""chick flick."" You will root for the characters, and you will feel like you're watching life-long friends. It may even motivate you to fry up some fried green tomatoes!"
5,It made me smile,An ecclectic collection of instrumental music with a combination of Eastern European Jewish music fused with jazz. The feeling it gave was one of warmth and fun. This CD just made me smile.
5,"Thoughtful, gentle, and with a transcendental message","Drawing upon her own personal experiences and life challenges, Susan Bock's Reluctant Healer: The Journey Of A Soul is the engaging parable of a woman who must undertake an inner journey to come into her own power and understand the importance of giving shape to her deepest dreams. Thoughtful, gentle, and with a transcendental message, Reluctant Healers is a voyage that envelops the reader's mind, spirit, and imagination until the last page is turned."
2,I Wanted to Love This Movie,"As a fan of tap dancing, I wanted to love this movie. Unfortunately, watching it was an endurance challenge. The movie lacks any sort of compelling story line. It essentially drives home the message that Robinson (aka Bojangles) was a gambling, womanizing s.o.b. I don't expect the film makers to rewrite history, but as presented the story didn't take us anywhere. Yes, the tap sequences by Hines and Glover are great, but they would have been greater without the packaging of the ""story."""
3,Bojangles vs. Tap,"If you didn't like Bojangles...get TAP. It's GREAT, and it just came out on DVD.Check out Savion Glover dancing in HAPPY FEET the movie. You see where he also added some of Gregory Hines steps in some cuts."
3,Interesting!,"I borrowed this video from the library, and viewed it only once. Once was all I could take. I never knew too much about bojangles, nor did I wanted to watch any of his movies. But I found his biography very interesting. Gregory Hines was superb in this video; hats off!. I saw the real bojangles in the movie ""Stormy Weather,"" and he was great. This movie was very moving and a bit depressing; but that's the way it was for the starving African Americans of the entertainment era. Thus proven by historians of the African American history."
1,not worth any money,I usually buy regular text books but thought I would give this a try. It is short and very basic-stuff you can find using a search engine. Save your money.
3,"predictable, if you are already a huge fan","This is the third of the City Hunter OVAs, and has substantially more story than the previous OVA, Bay City Wars. If you have seen the City Hunter series before, you will feel like this story is predictable, leaving you somewhat not interested in the rest of the story. Persevere, please. People who have not seen the series perhaps will not be as disappointed. Again I feel this stroy is not particularly suited for an OVA. There are plenty of other stories in the series which are worthier of the OVA treatment."
5,brings out my *mother bear* instinct,"We all know the benefits of breastfeeding. Some women breastfeed, and should be encouraged and supported in this role. Other women don't breastfeed, or only breastfeed for a very short time. Should we blame them, judge them, add to their burden of guilt? Not according to Minchin. We should all think about what society has done to lead to this situation. Who is supporting and encouraging the women and their babies who do not take to breastfeeding blissfully and easily?I experienced very fierce emotions when reading this book for the first time, it definately changed my life. My previous attitude that bottle-feeding mums were failures has been replaced by a strong feeling that society had failed these women and their families, (and an immense feeling of guilt for being so harsh in my previous judgement)."
5,A joy to read!,"Fossiling in Florida is a fast paced, light hearted book on the excitement of fossil hunting in Florida. No old, dry bones here. It isn't weighed down by boring science facts and doesn't trip over ponderous Latin names. Just loads of accurate information presented in an easy to read manner. I reccommend this book to any one interested in fossil hunting. Even the armchair adventurer will enjoy this romp through Florida's past. Mark Renz's charm, knowledge and humor speed you on your way so quickly it's a one sitting read. Mrs. Renz's art work adds volumes to the enjoyment of the book. This lady knows her husband!! Don't stop at the book, take the trip, I did and can guarantee you will come away begging for more."
4,"Good book, well written.","This was a good book. Easy to read with good points and a lot of humor. If you are interested in fossils in Florida, this book is one of the ones that is a definite must read."
1,not worth the time or money,"Save your money and buy a diffent book!I felt Robin Browns book Fossiling in florida was much better and has lots of location information.Although it has quite a few photos to help id bones and teeth, rest of the text is pretty much fluff and filler.If I had seen this book before purchase, I would not have spent the time or money on it."
5,Love this movie,I love this movie = it have a sense of Indiana Jones without falling in to the clone sphere of most others. I won't buy any of those but I will buy this one on it own merits - it is a good film and I love Tom Selleck
5,DVD? When??????????????,"""I don't expect Amazon will publish this review and don't hold your breath for any DVD release of this film. Hollywood and the liberal press disagree with Tom's politics hence most of his efforts will be suppressed. He has been hound dogged by the IRS under liberal administrations, mauled by savage talk show hosts, and like Charlton Heston, pinned with an Un-Disney label for his association with the NRA. Sorry and I wish I was wrong."" I couldn't agree with you more. I ~WISH~ this would come out on DVD, it is truly a great movie, in almost every way. One off the wall observation - Bess Armstrong's fully clothed Charleston on a table was far sexier than any nude scene I have ever seen. She and Selleck were wonderful together."
2,Most reviews are not for this Blu-ray product,"Due to poor audio and video quality, especially at the end, I returned the first Blu-ray. The second was just as bad. In reading other reviews, a majority of those I read were 4 or 5 star ratings of the movie itself before it was released to Blu-ray (and even before it was released to DVD)."
3,Excellant Movie but ...,This movie came out in 1983 early in Tom Selleck's career and is really outstanding. It has been a long time coming to DVD and unfortunately the quality is not up to newer Blue-Ray standards. Tends to be a bit grainey and the colors are a bit washed out.
3,An undemanding old-fashioned adventure,"Originally intended as a Roger Moore vehicle before being given to Tom Selleck as a consolation prize for missing out on Indiana Jones, formulaic old-fashioned adventure High Road to China is not a great film, but it's not a terrible one either. Directed by Brian G. Hutton as a `favor,' it gets off to an awkwardly perfunctory start that just feels like it's going through the motions, but while it doesn't exactly hits the heights it does get a lot better as it goes along until it settles down to being a forgettably enjoyable enough time-filler. John Barry's score is pleasant enough but far too laid back to add much oomph to a film that definitely needs it.The Swedish PAL DVD isn't great, but offers an acceptable transfer with English soundtrack and with removeable Swedish subtitles. The only extras are trailers for The Deer Hunter, Highlander and The Third Twin but not the main feature itself."
3,I'll take what I can get,"Okay, so it's not the best copy in the world, but at least I have a DVD copy of this gem; and worth every dime I should add. I bought this DVD because I couldn't wait any longer for a US Format to be produced. Like most fans of this movie, I can't understand why this movie has not been remastered and released in the US, but I'm sure a Lawyer is involved somehow.Anyway, it doesn't work on my home theater but works fine on my laptop."
2,poor Blu- Ray,"The original version was very clear with great colors, the new Blue-Ray version was not clear or very sharp, at times the image appeared smokey. I would not recommend anyone buying the High Road to China in Blue - Ray"
1,"Save the $$, get the DVD","I love this movie and have been waiting a very long time for it to come out on DVD and/or Blu-Ray. Remembering the beautiful scenary, I went ahead and bought the Blu-Ray disk. I was disappointed in the quality. It looked about the same as the VHS copies I'd seen years ago. If you are considering purchasing the movie don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray. (And a digital copy would be nice)."
3,Blueray Review on most recent Blueray Release,"As other reviews have stated this new blueray release is probably the best picture available for this early 1980's movie that did not have great production values to start with. In the tradition of such other high adventure movies like the 1985 King Solomon's mines, High Road to China does not take itself too seriously, and is a good Saturday afternoon, popcorn, armchair movie to watch. The real disappointment however with this new blueray release is the vocal sound of the actors and sound in general which is the lowest possible quality I think available, and took me right out of the movie. I kept wanting to play my VHS copy soundtrack over the blueray copy of the movie to see if it didn't improve the overall experience. Its nice to have a blueray copy now that will not continue to deteriorate over time like the VHS copy will, but it is sad to think that a good soundtrack of the movie will be lost forever as time goes by."
4,"Movie 5star, DVD not so much...","We are finally enjoying HRTC again, after the VHS copy wore out. Had to purchase a region-free DVD player just for this movie. Sound is reminiscent of an old scratchy record, and it is not widescreen BUT it's better than nothing!Pioneer Dv610av-k Black Multi Region Code Free Hdmi Upconverting 1080p DVD Playeror similiar. I know we all wish Warner Brothers would WAKE UP and do this movie justice!"
2,Very disappointing,"We have long awaited a DVD edition of a favorite movie; naturally, we still love the movie but this DVD version is just plain crummy. Reds are too intense, especially for Tom Sellack's face. The biggest disappointment though is the musical score. In the VHS version the score is one of the great strengths of the movie, hauntingly beautiful. It is flat in this DVD version. The last scene and the credits sound positively ""fuzzy"". Since our old VHS tape is terribly worn, we have ordered a new tape and will never watch this miserable effort again."
4,High Road to China,"PQ 3.5, AQ 2.0. I am a huge fan of this movie, up until this time owning only a sadly overwatched vhs tape. Though I could have wished for a better video transfer and remixed audio, I am fairly happy with the BD. Picture is soft quite a bit of the time, and audio is basic dolby II, but it is so far superior to what's been available (and will probably never look better) that it's a bargain. Hats off to Hens Tooth for getting this classic movie out to the public."
4,Bring It Back on Widescreen DVD,Enough said about this movie. Please make sure you release it on DVD in Widescreen format. That is the only way to enjoy the beautiful scenery. Thx!
2,"COPIED FROM A VHS, NOT DIGITAL QUALITY","THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS OF ALL TIME. I'M GLAD TO HAVE A COPY. HOWEVER THIS APPEARS TO BE A DVD COPIED FROM A VHS. NOT DIGITAL QUALITY. AS IT IS AN ASIAN COMPANY, THIS DOESN'T SURPRISE ME A BIT. I AM A FILM MAKER, SO MY JUDGEMENT IN THIS MATTER IS FROM A PRO STANDPOINT. SERVICE WAS GOOD, QUALITY OF PRODUCT....DISAPPOINTING!!!!"
1,Non-responsive with item or communication,"Item promised by Dec. 15, 2008 now Dec. 27th and still no VHS. Attempted contact twice with no response. Contacted credit card company to dispute the payment for NO item. Not a satisfied or happy customer."
2,Twenty dollars??,"For this? There's not even the nude scene that makes Lassiter worth it for some fans.Average film, a two at best. Selleck should've gone with Raiders of the Lost Ark."
1,Great movie but very disappointing DVD release,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time and contains one of John Barry's best scores ever, so my wife and I really looked forward to this first ever Region I DVD release.We were sorely disappointed. The sound quality is so bad that at times it is difficult to recognize the voices of Tom Selleck and Bess Armstrong. The beautiful soundtrack is distorted and muted and just about ruined.The image is the correct size for HD, but the colors are garish at times.My recommendation: Listen to the official release CD soundtrack that has been out for 3 decades and hope that the copyright owners finally make a worthy version soon."
4,What the...,"I saw ""High Road To China"" when it hit the theaters and it has never faded as a favorite. It's not ""Top Gun"", nor ""Citizen Kane"", but for ""romantics"", there's nothing quite like an open cockpit biplane, and some awesome cinematography... and Selleck is always one of the best dead-pan jokesters ever. This is not a pretentious movie, it is pure entertainment. My VHS of this movie is wearing thin, and I've been on the ""notify me"" list for the DVD for years. I can't believe that you can get ""The Devil Comes To Frogtown"" on DVD, but ""High Road To China"" is only available on DVD in Sweden. Thanks again, ever so much, to yet another dim-witted studio exec."
4,an entertaining pice of sillyness,This a a modern classic of sillyness between a chronic alcoholic and a strong willed socialite. Lot of entertaining adventures with a satisfying conclusion. The final line from Tom Selleck to Bess Armstrong is a real classic and well worth the price of admission in itself - I'm not going to tell you - ypu have to watch it.
2,Poor quality recoring,"The wife and I loved the movie, but the sound and color were really sub-par. It sounds like they're in a tunnel the whole time, and everything's pale. Too bad, because we love the flick."
3,Not as enthusiastic as most,"I obtained this film largely because of all the positive reviews, however I found it somewhat lacking. The exchanges between Selleck and Armstrong largely consist of them yelling at each other. Frequent, and I mean frequent, violation of the third of the Ten Commandments is an indicator of the quality of the dialogue. Nothing subtle or very witty here. If you are interested in a film with great bi-plane actionTHE GREAT WALDO PEPPERis far superior."
3,Strange circumstances,"Having lost the role of Indiana Jones thanks to MAGNUM PI, Tom Selleck inherited this project with Bess Armstrong that had originally been intended for Roger Moore and Bo Derek. Entertaining but not much more than that."
1,High road to china VHS tape,Good movie. Extremely poor quality of recording that I was sold. Not sure what exactly they were selling here but it not worth keeping.
1,on DVD not VHS,"When I added this item to my wish list, I apparently did not see the VHS entry, I thought I was ordering this item on DVD..."
1,Change.,"There has been a big mistake, because the dvd that you send me is not from region 2, has not any kind of subtitle, I kindly request the exchange of this item as soon as posible for the one I ordered with the indicated atributions.I'll be waiting for your instructions.Thank you very much.Javier Linares."
1,High Road to China Review,"I received this movie and it wouldn't even play. I returned it to you,and received a refund thank you.I was very disappointed because this was a Xmas present for my husband.I may not order anything else through you, because I am not sureof the quality of the movie that I would receive."
3,Tom Selleck Memories,Hadn't seen this in ages - always fun to go down memory lane with Tom - but it is a cheesy 80's movie! :)
5,Loved this movie and is even better in Blue ray.,"Excellent movie, Great story line, acting was the best. Tom Selleck, Bess Armstrong were outstanding. The mechanic is an actor I have always enjoyed his work, I wish I could remember his name, (forgive me this). He deserves better recognition for his part. A must have for my collection. Great Family movie."
5,The Most Brilliant Movie,Fanastic movie. I can't belive you people at movie world havent released this on DVD yet. I loved the action the acting Tom and Bess did this movie proud. I want to be the first person to order a copy when it is released. Come on guys this is the 21st century get with the programme and release it or better still bring it back to the big screen.Trish
2,Botched sound?Buyer beware!,"This is easily the worst DVD I have ever owned and/or watched and I own thousands. The sound breaks up, drops off,crackles,hisses and pops. When I learned HRTC was coming to DVD and BLU I rejoiced as this is one terrific film never available on DVD in America. Such a shame. I mean it's barely watchable .Avoid this release and stick with your VHS .I own the BLU version too and it's nearly as bad.As for the video presentation..flat on DVD with no black level and poor detail. My bluray player couldn't even do it justice.Popped the Blu version in and noticed some, mind you, some improvement but not enough in sound and a vast improvement in picture quality but still not enough to warrant this as an official release. Folks the sound is terrible in either format! Beware!Also the sound is misprinted on the bluray as 2.o dolby stereo when it's in fact DTS MASTER 2.0 mono. Way to go Hen's Tooth..stellar release."
3,wish it was better,I have waited a long time for this movie to be released in USA DVD format. The quality of the movie is grainy a lot like the old VHS tape I had. Love the movie wish it was clearer
3,Not my first choice,I purchased this DVD only because the studio refuses to to release it. I believe this disc comes from Sweden. The sound and picture are not great. This great film deserves better. I do own the studio edition on VHS and that quality is better than this DVD.
1,Save your money,"One of my favorite all time movies...one of the all time disasters of a re-issue DVD.Colors are very washed out. Too bad as the scenery of the original LD was spectacular.Sound track is quite substandard. Even a VERY expensive surround sound system couldn't bring the sound back to life.Was tempted to buy the Blu Ray disc to see if it is any better but have decided to wait, again.If you've never seen the movie... maybe a purchase if you can stand the crapola that you're being sold.If you've seen the movie in its original format... save your money."
3,dissapointing soundtrack,"I have waited years and years for this film to be released and to finally be able to own a true DVD copy was exciting. Actually this film was my very first VHS purchase when I decided to build a movie collection in the early 80's. After reading other reviews I strongly agree that although the picture quality is excellent, the mono soundtrack is lacking. even running through simulated stereo or 5.1 it lacks the luster of the original soundtrack. great transfer, great vistas, scenery, great flying... this film needs to be treated with a DTS/Dolby soundtrack to give it the depth it deserves. but in the long run, this copy is better than none at all."
1,High Road to China & Lassiter,Both these films are a lot of fun and conspicuous by there absence on DVD. It never fails to amaze me how so much junk gets issued on DVD yet so many fine older films are totally ignored by the studios. These two films would make a great two pack.
5,High Road to Enjoyment,"This has to be one of the most underrated films of all time. When all is said and done it is simply a ripping good adventure story - musically, visually, plot-wise and every other wise. If you want heavy drama try Laurence Olivier, but if you want an excellent adventure that is also a good period piece and if you find that biplanes turn you on, then you will enjoy watching HIGH ROAD TO CHINA again and again and this IS your movie. AAAAA+++++"
4,High Road to China,"This movie has stood the test of time...and my memory. Although I haven't seen it in years, I remember loving it. This film has everything from adventure to comedy & even romance. Both Tom Selleck & Bess Armstrong are wonderful in the movie; they are terrific actors! As always, Wilfred Brimley is a treat.This is a nice film for the family, I look forward to sharing it with mine. A relief from some of the hackneyed plots you see out there.I look forward to owning it on DVD."
5,One of his best,"This is a lost treasure. Tom Selleck & Bess Armstrong are at their best in this movie! They REALLY need to reissue it, it's sure to be a hit this time, more so than before."
1,"Disappointed I am in the sender, not the movie","The movie that was sent me was formatted for a different region and cannot be played on DVD players in my area.Knowing where I live, why would you send me this movie that I would have to return?"
3,Not Blue Ray Quality,The picture was not as crisp as I expected from a blue ray dvd. It is much better than VHS but more like the ole laser disc which I still own. Just wasn't up to my expectations.
5,Movie,Great movie and one of my all time Tom Selleck movies. Got it within a week along with the others.
5,One of Tom Selleck's BEST,"I am so glad Amazon offers this! I have been waiting for decades!!!A great roaring twenties romantic romp! ""The ox is slow but the earth is patient."""
4,High Road to China,"Fine movie. Will watch it over again, Have most of the Selich films. Ordering the first season of ""Blue Bloods"". Will be gettin the second season soon."
5,High Road to China is a High Road to Entertainment,"Once again the critics have goofed. High Road to China starring Tom Selleck is a winner. My husband and I have watched this movie countless times and never seem to tire of it. As a romantic comedy it is both fun and easy on the eyes. High Road to China is a most enjoyable movie in which Bess Armstrong and Tom Selleck are at their best with a special kind of chemistry between them. The scenery is magnificent,the story line plausible and interesting and the dialogue fun. The musical score is wonderful too. A real must if you've loved the movie. What better way to spend a romantic evening than with one of Hollywood's romantic leading men and one of your own?"
4,High road to china,I really like this movie for what it really is. A beer and popcorn movie.Yes it's a little corny. That's where the popcorn comes in. It's schmaltzy and that's where the beer comes in. Get and Enjoy.
2,Quality of Blu-Ray Picture is VERY Poor for 'High Road to China',"I was VERY disappointed in the quality of this Blu-Ray. It was faded like the old VHS which I do have. I had waited a long time for 'High Road to China' to come out in just DVD. It has absolutely beautiful flying sequences. This is the first time that I have ordered a Blu-Ray and received this kind of product. I opened it and watched it, so I am stuck with the film. I just don't want anyone else to have the same thing happen."
4,"Somewhat pricey, but....","They rarely make them like this anymore. Very well done, an adventure film that's somewhat more adult, takes its time, and has acting and writing that's above the level of television shows, easily, from a time when adventure films didn't necessarily have to knock you through a wall or push you towards exhaustion in order to entertain you. Seriously, you'll enjoy this film, I really believe so.In spite of being a BluRay, the transfer is pretty bad, but at least you get to see it again, anytime you want. The sound recording is also pretty poor, on level with TV shows of the time... And it's too expensive in light of these issues - but I don't regret buying it myself. It's a great little movie."
3,HIGH ROAD TO CHINA DVD,"MY RATING WAS FOR THE FACT IT WAS NOT IN 5.1 IT IS JUST 2 TRACK SOUND, BUT THE MOVIE IS STILL A GREAT BUY."
5,Finally!,"After 29 years, ""High Road to China"" is finally on DVD! For a great, family-friendly film with plenty of action, beautiful locations, classic romance, and a stellar cast, it can't be beat. I have loved this film since I first saw it in the theater and have subsequently worn out two VHS copies of it. The film has all the hallmarks of the classic adventure/romance story, which always makes me wonder why it never received the fame and popularity of similar films of its day.The chemistry between the characters alone makes the film a standout, while the post World War I setting makes one yearn for the bygone age of world-circling adventure in exotic locations. Combine that with real vintage aircraft, in some gorgeous and spectacularly filmed flying sequences, and this film is truly top-drawer."
5,Such a great movie!,"We waited SUCH a long time for this to be on DVD or Blu-Ray, but it was worth it! To us, this is one of Tom Selleck's best roles. The drunken, unshaven, washed-up aviator Patrick O'Malley turns out to be a man worth his weight in gold (or cannonballs). One of our favorites and one to watch again and again! The soundtrack is beautiful too."
2,"If you can't dance, don't buy","If you are a good dancer, you will be able to pick up these steps quickly. For a beginner or average user, the learning curve is steep despite one disc being labeled ""for dummies."" These are better for an intermediate user who is more interested in an aerobic-dance style work out than a kickboxing focused work out. I shelved them and went back to my old DVDs."
5,Amazing story- a must read!,"This is a great book by my favorite author ever. Christopher Pike's books always hook me right away, and this one is no exception. The characterization is great, plot moves quickly, and the writing style is outstanding. Every time I read one of Christopher Pike's books, it always leaves me with a lot to think about and a hopeful outlook on the world. I highly recommend The Listeners."
5,My Favorite Book of Pike's!,"This is my favorite book of Christopher Pike's so far. I liked it a lot better than ""The Cold One"" and ""Seasons of Passage"". They were good too, but I thought this book was a lot better. I have read this book at least 10 times in the past ten years and plan to read it many more."
5,Theme,"I have read the The Listeners and I loved it. It had a combination of elements of the classic novel, such as romance, but had a unique twist to it that made it hard to put down, even for a second. It gripped me from the first page, and I finished it in one night, thus getting no sleep. I have also read The Last Vampire series, and if you have read it, then you know that humanity's ancient past is a reccuring theme in his books, as is the worship of Isis and Set. He also delvs into other forms of worship, particularly Hindu. He speaks of Krishna often, and reincarnates the dark goddess Kali Ma in the Vampire series, all of which are very good for younger readers. The Listeners is more of an adult novel, and is good if you like Christopher Pike but wich to graduate to a more sophisticated reading level."
4,Amazing racing game!,"I was very surprised about the quality of this game. The textures are smooth, the animation is clean and it looks almost like a cartoon. I recommend this game to anyone! To much fun!"
3,Lost in Kansas,This was a frustrating atlas because so many road names and roads were inaccurate. Thought I would rather explore Kansas with this atlas than without this atlas.
2,"""Okay"" story; lots of guesswork; not a scholarly book as I'd expected","This book is an interesting read, but it wasn't what I'd expected. I'm doing research on Emma, so I'd hoped for more footnotes and scholarly research. Instead it's primarily fiction based on a real person. Much of what is written is guesswork -- what Emma might have experienced. If there is research to back it up, it's not shared with the reader. This would have been an excellent edition. The writing wasn't as polished as I would have expected. For example, the flashback scenes are confusing. Yes, Emma would have been confused while experiencing these flashbacks (don't want to spoil the story in this review). HOWEVER, it wasn't written expertly. It is a good story if you accept it primarily as an ""okay"" story based on a real person -- and nothing more. Sorry."
5,Squared away!!!,"This case is very squared away and well organized. I can fit everything I need to take with me while I am traveling as far as my PS2 with a flip up screen is concerned. It fits 2 controllers, the slim PS2 with attached screen, 8 games, and power supply. The construction is very solid and befitting of such a squared away system. You can't go wrong with this case especially as low price as Amazon offers it. Don't think twice, buy this case!"
4,Lot at the end of the block,"Toddlers enjoy repetition. (For those of you who have just read the same book for the fifth time today to your little one, this is no mystery!). Toddlers also love construction vehicles. The story is a cumulative tale written in the ""House-That-Jack- Built"" style and has bright illustrations showing a 4-story building going up. In other words, _The lot at the end of the block_ is a winning combination for toddlers and other young children who are intrigued by construction. Beware though, your tongue may become tied after multiple readings! I do wish that there was at least one ""token"" female operating some heavy equipment..."
4,A surprise at the end of the book.,"This book is about a boy watching a new apartment complex being built at the end of his block. The book is written in the repetitive style like ""The House That Jack Built"" and songs that are sung in rounds. It is also written in rhymes. Young children really enjoy construction stories and pictures (look at the Bob the Builder series) and this book is not only fun to listen to and read, but introduces children to a few construction terms as well. A delightful little book."
3,"Truck book, for toddlers/preschoolers","We really enjoyed ""My truck is stuck"" and ""Dinosaur Dinosaur"" so we thought we'd try this book as well. It's just ok, especially when compared to the two before mentioned books. This one is very repetative, reminds me of the old lady who swallowed a fly diatribe. So, if that's something you like, then this book would be for you. otherwise, I would recommend some of Kevin's other books before this one."
1,poor business,"this product came used and it was sold as new, the return letter from the person that sent it back was still inside the box. also the box came postage due, I paid it wrote the company back, sent them the label,letter and asked for reimbursment and made some not to pleasant remarks. never heard one thing back."
1,Awful,"i got this phone for christmas and for the first month it seemed fine, then it started to freeze and not work. i got it replaced and the new one worked for only a little too. last night the speaker in the back was humming and no sounds would be heard on the phone. im exchanging it for a motorola today..dont buy"
1,This phone has problems,"First Review : December 13,2005 I bought this phone for my wife only 2 weeks ago and she is having problems with this Z520a.All of a sudden, this phone locks up. The animated wallpaper will turn into still solid weared screen. After it locks up, it does not ring for incoming calls. She cannot make calls either. The only option is to turn off the phone, but it does not turn back on until she removes the battery which is really a pain.I have contacted Cingular but so far dissapointed with customer service as the person answers the phone takes all the information and then promises a call back. I missed call back and now I am running in circle.Update: 12-19-2005 Finally Cingular sent her a new phone. Let's see how it goes with this new replacement phone."
1,BAD NEWS!!! Don't get it!,"I'm a Cingular customer, and I've just exchanged this for something else. I'm really bummed out that this phone isn't what it's all cracked up to be. It's really really cool...but it doesn't work.The first thing you should do if you want this phone is to visit the Cingular forums and read all the posts about this phone - you'll be glad you did. I thought initially that my problems might only be with my specific phone...looks like my problems are wide spread, and several other users had the same issues:The phone turns itself off unexpectedlyThe screen/wallpaper goes blackYou need to remove and replace the battery sometimes after the unit has crashed/frozen upMISSED CALLS, MISSED CALLS, MISSED CALLSPhone is not ready for prime time. I'd stay away at all costs. yes, it's a really neat little phone but for me, I'd rather have something dependable."
1,Good for one year only,"My wife and I have owned this phone for just over a year. The phone worked well at first then we started having problems once we entered the 13th month of ownership. The screen would go blank, we were unable to make or receive calls, the graphics (background themes, button displays, etc) change from day to day. I am able to make a phone call but am unable to hear anything unless I use the speaker option. My wife's phone has had the same problems. I have gone through master reset a couple of time trying to fix the problem, it works for a while and then starts to haywire again. This will be the last Sony Ericsson phone we will ever purchase."
4,"Has some quirks, overall a good phone","Pros:- Interface is well done- Easy to transfer themes, MP3 ringtones, contacts, etc. via Bluetooth- Sony software makes it easy to create your own themes with their software- Was very simple to configure as a modem for my iBookCons:- Early version had a software bug that required the phone be restarted every couple of days (fixed February of '06)- Camera button cannot be locked, and often goes off in pocket (until the memory is full, then it's no longer a problem)"
2,DO NOT GET THIS PHONE,"I have had this phone since December of 2005 and have had to have it replaced four times! This first phone kept locking up due to the firmware version, the 2nd one worked fine for a week and then lost the network, (my SIM card worked fine in any other phone), the 3rd phone barely held a signal and would drop calls, the phone I have now doesn't seem too bad, but the reception isn't as strong as the first one I had... When this phone works it has great features, but for the price it's not worth the hastle!"
2,Its begining good - for a month!!!,"It was a really great for like a month! Then it started to not have network conections and you can't make phone calls. Then we tried a new ""smartchip"". It wasn't that smart. It was horrible! We the n sent out for a new phone and they sent us the same phone and 2 months later i broke! We were so mad. We talked to them and they gave me a Motorola v557! I would not try his phone at all!! It was so bad. You'll regret it later."
2,Returned the phone after one days use...,"Well, I learned my lesson. I have been and always will be a motorola fan although I thought I would try something new and there in lies my mistake. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the phone other than the fact that it did not fit me at all. After one days use, I went home, put it in the box, called cingular to tell them I was returning it and haven't regreted it since. I kept hitting the camera button, it did not feel comfortable on my face when I was talking on the phone and the 'new age' antenna is a load of you know what. After I got it in the mail, I realized how ugly of a phone it was and the technology aspect never really won me over. Sony needs to reconsider how they make phones for this one was more a pain in the rear to use than anything else. I have ordered what I originally wanted which was the motorola v557 and can't wait to get it for I truly miss my moto!"
1,dont buy because you are getting rebate,"i thing i made a biggest mistake by purchasing this phone for rebate. it has already been more that three months and i havent got anything from these peoples and in customor service too i get the differnt reply each time i called them and they dont know how system of rebate work, its rediculous!.the phone is ok but i am using my old phone instead."
1,Phone is abysmal!!!!,"My frustrations with this phone have prompted me to write my very first review on amazon. I have had three different versions of this phone in the last 3 months including one with the new hardware update- but it consistently drops calls and the display don't work. I was unable to place or make calls for two days although the phone thought I was ""connected""= so I have been a cell phone user for >10 years and have never had so many problems with one phone- I had to write something to save someone else from my frustration-"
1,a terrible phone,"After owning this phone for two weeks, I returned it today and am so happy. This phone sucked. It looks good but the design has a fatal flaw. The camera button is located at such a spot that when you pick up the phone and open up the flip, you will touch it. You will touch it even when you are on the phone talking. My husband once used my phone to make a call and took more than 10 photos when holding the phone talking. His hand is too big for this phone to avoid touching the phone. It became very annoying.Also, I had dropped calls often with this phone, but I was not sure it was the phone's problem or the service problem. By the way, Cingular's customer service sucks too. They close on Sundays and also close after 9pm on weekdays. On Saturdays they are on a shortened schedule. It was very inconvenient when you had a problem and needed help."
1,Very dissatisfied,"I got two of these phones. One for me and one for my wife. My wife had problems from the start. Her phone didn't get good reception, but mine did.It was hard to find accessories for this phone.My daughter is teething and she got hold of the phone and slobbered on it. The phone immediately started acting up. The microphone stopped working, the top three buttons no longer work, lights stay lit when they aren't supposed to.I sent it in to Ericssons to have it repaired and it was returned to me unrepaired because the water damage voided the warranty.I've always had motorolas in the past. This is the first ericssons. I'll never get an ericssons again."
3,"good battery life, but...","This phone has great battery life. Call quality is ok. I had lots of dropped calls, buzzing, etc. then got Cingular to replace it for me. It's been fine since then.The camera quality isn't that great, photos are grainy and don't look good anywhere but on the camera (and even then they aren't perfect). The camera button is on the outside of the phone and frequently gets pressed when the phone is in a pocket, bag, etc., resulting in lots of black photos that need to be deleted.I get really good reception with this phone, I live in a mid-sized city and use Cingular."
5,Z250a Sony Ericsson,I think this phone is great. I love the menu options and is the best Sony Ericsson that came out on the market. I have it for 2 months now and I just love it. I recomand the Z250a
1,Sony Ericsson has appalling warranty support,"I had purchased two Z520a phones, one of which was defective upon receipt.I shipped the phone for warranty repairs. However, I was without a cell phone for a month because of their lack of response.There seemed to be little to no communication between the warranty repair center and the customer service support. It was difficult to get any repair information, and the phone was returned to me unrepaired with the statement that the repairs were not under the warranty coverage.Obviously, one less Sony Ericsson customer here........."
2,Terrible Phone for the Money,"I opted for this phone over the Razr in May of 2006, because I thought the Razr was over-hyped. To my dismay, I wish I would have gotten a razr.I am extremely careful with my phones and I've never dropped it until a couple weeks ago. Regardless, this phone started giving me trouble after having it for only 2 months. I live in an AT&T; coverare area, yet it frequently drops calls or I couldn't connect to the person I was calling. The biggest problem I had was that it would constantly freeze and I'd have to take out the battery to reset the phone. Additionally, for those concerned with pictures, the quality of pictures on this phone are terrible.I did, however, like the bluetooth capabilities with the phone, as well as the arm support that the intenna provided.All in all, I would not recommend this phone to anyone at all - the Razr, although over-hyped, is much better quality."
4,Nice phone,"I love the looks, the form factor, the great reception (more bars showing than any of my previous phones), the MP3 ringtones, and its many other features. It works with the Google Maps for Mobile client, and with the GMail client (these are cool Java apps that you download onto the phone from Google).I had one problem where it would connect to my Prius over Bluetooth when I turned the car on, and then about a minute later, the phone would beep and drop the Bluetooth connection. I eventually worked out the fix - go into the phone's Bluetooth menu and turn on the ""Powersave"" option, which makes it only accept one Bluetooth connection at a time. Now it works with my car's handsfree mode perfectly.The Bluetooth connection to my Mac works really well, and it was not hard to sync my address book, or transfer MP3s to the phone over Bluetooth."
1,"Poor choice, poor software and connections...","For a relatively basic flip, this phone has been an absolute disaster. Call quality is great, yet for some reason at around 20 minutes, it loses its connection to the towers, the bars drop to zero, and I get disconnected. Every time.It will often display 5 bars of coverage, drop to zero the moment you dial out and not connect, and then go back to 5 bars.Basically the phone is useless on Cingular unless you have perfect coverage. Perhaps I have older firmware or something, but it is not like I should have to worry about that."
3,"Cool features, but...","Pros:1. Real music ringtones.2. Bluetooth3. Small form factorCons:1. The phone tends to cut out based on the direction you are facing or if you put your hand over the antenna loop.2. The placement of the button that activates the camera. It is on the side of the phone, and just carrying it in your pocket is enough to activate the camera. I'll be walking along, and all of a sudden I hear the camera snapping photos of the inside of my pocket. Also, when you pick the phone up, you have to actually try to NOT activate the camera. The button is right where you grab the phone when you pick it up.Conclusions: While I love the bluetooth connectivity and the real music ringtones, there are other, better phones out there that have both. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this phone."
1,Inactive Smart Chip,"I bought 5 of these phones this past week for my family plan. The phone has everything we wanted, quad band, blue tooth and a camera. My biggest problem is the continual inactive smart chip errors that occur. I need to reboot the phone several times a day. Neither Cingular nor Sony knows what is going on. My second problem, which others have noted, is the poor location of the camra button. The software needs to be changed, so that the camera can only work after activation through the menu. (This is an easy firmware fix for Sony, if enough people complain about it. )"
2,I dropped this phone ONE TIME,"Even if you're careful, you might occasionally drop your phone. My previous phones were able to survive a few drops. I dropped this one ONCE, and the screen died. Before that, it worked fine."
4,Get a case for it,"Most things have already been said about this phone. It's a good one for the price/class.For all the people complaining about the camera button, buy a bodyglove case for you phone. Since I did this, I have not had one issue - not one - with the camera button. The thin edge of the case adds just enough thickness to the side of the phone that the camera button is no longer too easy to accidentally press."
4,wowww,"Amazing talent. Heard River Jordan, and knew that is the song I wanted to sing with my brother and sister at our mothers funeral. Hopfuly it's a while yet. The song moved me inside."
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty Good. Some great songs, but some a little cheesy. I kinda wish he didn't write English songs. But overall good. I would still recommend it."
4,Comments from one who has a lot to learn,"I am a novice to tracking. Primarily my goal is to learn more about the wildlife on my own property ... what all is here and what they are doing. I've learned a lot in the short time I've had this book. It would be helpful if there were photos of the actual animals; and, very, very helpful if there were lots more comparative analysis between similiar tracks, etc., like the one comparing dog tracks versus coyote tracks ... much like in National Geographic's Complete Birds of North America, where they cross reference birds of similar appearance (a very helpful feature)."
3,Excellent but with a caveat or two,"While I agree with most of the praise that others readers of this book have expressed, there are a few oddities. Most of the tracks, etc. are photographed without a scale to give an immediate impression of relative size. Additionally, some of the schematic drawings are sometimes confusingly labeled, though the meanings of each become clear with a few re-readings. I guess I wish that the author had asked less experienced trackers to review the manuscript, as a lot of these minor details would probably have been cleared up prior to publication. That being said, one of the major strengths of this guide is the section that illustates various gaits and the subsequent trails they potentially leave. Very few, if any, other guides out there give this difficult aspect of tracking the exhaustive treatment that this author does; a much-needed treatise, so thank you!"
5,Incredible field reference manual,"I very much enjoyed this book. The author goes into painstaking detail of many many animals (probably some you've never heard of). Not only are the tracks explained, but the possible gaits of each animal, along with the most likely ones are given great attention. There are even sections given to animal scat, what each animal eats, what claw marks might look like and one of my favorites: how to identify predators and prey from kill sites.This book will remain the standard to the lay person and advanced tracker for quite some time (or at least until wild animals all have GPS embedded in them).Kudos!"
3,"Excellent book, but...","Wow, this is a great tracking book. So full of detail, a wealth of information. i am, however not an expert tracker and am using this with my home schooled kids to learn the signs left by the animals that live in the woods behind our house. For that purpose it is much too cumbersome. The biggest disappointment being that while there are so many photographs of tracks and scat, there are not any of the animals. It would be nice to see the different bears the tracks describe for example. That would be very helpful for the purpose we seek to use this book."
1,Disappointed!!,I bought this product hoping to make molds for polymer clay. I tried to make molds out of numerous pieces of old jewelry. It failed to capture any details. It might work for something with a basic shape with less details. I am going to try using a resin mold instead to see if that works out.
4,Mold maker,"I've only used about half the product so far, but it seems to work fairly well. I did have some problems getting things to release, even when I used corn starch. I might need to try something else."
2,AVOID THIS ONE !!!,"Not an actual gig but a compilation of live tracks.This is advertised as an ""official bootleg"",meaning sh..tty takes released by an official label.The sound is AWFUL,no upper treble,vox on top of it all,etc.On the positive side,most versions of the song are very wild and raw.NOT EVEN FOR THE DIE HARD FANS."
2,Retreat,"The idea is good, the content is limited. When the singer appears in the same bed as the victim is kind of confusing. The opportunity to present a message and tell a story of hope is amazing there is room for so much more."
1,"Run, don't walk away.......","I purchased the Digital Photo Copy Cruiser Plus to use on vacation. What a waste of money. Yes, it did as advertised - but only after spending 30 minutes on the phone with tech support to get it to copy a 2gb card. The 'instructions' in the manual are not complete and it turns out you can ONLY can use the disk spanning capabilities with the REMOTE.... excuse me? What if you forget the remote... too bad... you are out of luck. Who in the heck thought that was a good idea? I wish I could give this less than 1 star.....This thing is going up on eBay ASAP."
4,I like it.,"Good variety of exercises. Very good descriptions and diagrams. Long introductory chapters regarding safety, physical and psychological maturation concerns, and the need for age-appropriate, individualized training regimens.This is a solid, well-organized, and fairly comprehensive treatment, addressing the needs of both young men and young women. By that last part I mean that strength training for girls is given meaningful coverage and not just mentioned as an afterthought."
1,STRENGTH TRAINING FOR GRANNIES?,"This is book really is about toning not for bodybuilders ( esspecially young ones) i think that a young bodybuilder should read magazines and go to a gym to find a routine that could suit ones self, this book gives you little knowledge on why the exercises should be performed.all in all , save your money ,i wish i could get mine back! :)"
2,Hard to Play,"This is the most difficult golf game that I have ever played... it is set on four different European PGA courses that are very challenging (don't play intoxicated). Player graphics aren't the best, flight graphics arent the best, in fact its very hard to place a shot with the wind in your face. Overall, only buy this game if you get it used. I did and Im glad"
5,For my 2004 Chevy Colorado,"This fit the fog lamps on my 2004 Chevy Colorado. Exactly as the one I purchased at the dealer parts/service, but about 10 bucks cheaper. I've only had to replace one, and it's been working well for about two months now."
1,Lasted less than 2 weeks,Changed Bulbs in a pair just like the OEM recomends and darned if the new bulb that replaced the working bulb didn't burn out in 10 days.
5,The dog psyche explained .. in pictures for human comprehension,"This was a gift from a wonderful friend and fellow canine appreciator. Simply, Thelwell is a comic genius. Those of us who support dogs (ownership is not an appropriate term) know how accurately some of these situations are depicted.Dogs are many things. But not stupid. If you are tempted to question this, just remember who goes out to earn the money to buy the food to feed the dog. I rest my case.Jennifer Cameron-Smithfood provider to Sir Bruce the Battle Rat and to ZorroMax, also known as Sir Other Little Dog"
5,@_@,"I love this book! It's very funny, and it's an easy and fun to read to kids (and also dogs ^_^). It is basically a summary about taking care of a dog. (But don't take it too literally)Top Dog is separated into nine different sections, containing different little sentences. I really enjoy the illustrations, which are on every page, but aren't in color (in my book). My favorite line is 'A comfortable place to sleep is, however, essential to your pet's wellbeing. A raised canvas couch will keep him out of draughts. And wicker baskets are always popular. You will soon discover the sort of bed he prefers.' And then there's a picture of the dog sleeping in the owner's bed. Har Har!Yeah, so this is a really great book. Even though I'm a teenager I still take it out and read it, and laugh at it all the time. I really recommend buying it!"
3,Voguestrap 18mm black watchband,"Aesthetically this strap is ideal for me; flat black, nothing fancy. There are enough adjustment holes to fit a wide range of wrists...even quite small ones as I have. Unfortunately the adjustment holes are easily torn (creating one large hole when two connect). This causes a loose fit and I'll likely need to replace it soon. Note that I may be a little less kind to my watch strap than some others will be. I do like the band material, it is comfortable and does not seem to be fraying at all. If you're relatively gentle with the adjustment peg and holes then it's a worthwhile strap for the price."
4,Al right but be cautious with the spring bars.,"The strap itself looks alright and is very very light even compared with the original canvas strap I had. I wasn't very lucky with the springbar though. It broke in less than two weeks of use. Thus, if you have the original spring bars better keep them, at least, for me, the original spring bars never gave me trouble in year and a half use."
3,Pretty basic,"Somehow I expected this watch band to be closer to the one that came on my Swiss Army watch. The picture shows a good likeness but it's actually very flimsy and basic quality. Also, it is one long strap, not two separate pieces, so the band goes across the back of the watch. I wouldn't get this one again. Silicone bands costing $10 - $15 are much nicer, although they do break sometimes if twisted unexpectedly."
5,I LOVE IT,I LOVE IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THOSE ANNOYNG PINS OUT TO PUT IT ON.JUST SHIDE IT THROUGH.VERY DURABLE.AND IT IS WATERPROOF...BUY ONE...FOR DIVER'S WATCHES ONLY.
3,More like a kids band.,"I thought it was a little short, more like a kids band but OK for the money. Seems durable and is comfortable to wear so I guess thats all you can ask."
4,"Good buy, decent band","This is a very good buy. It's a modest band...very easy to attach and has a good, ""light"" feel. I'm very pleased and would definitely buy again."
5,Adventurers of Purse and Person: Virginia 1607-1624/5: Families A-F Volume,Excellent documentation on Jamestowne which proved my relationship to my Jamestowne Ancestor. The book was accepted as proof for my membership in the Jamestowne Society.
2,uses old street names,Even though this map claims to be a recent edition it still uses the old names for many of the streets. As you can imagine this causes problems when trying to find places.
5,Nothing short of a miracle,"This play (and this DVD was made directly from the Broadway play) is simply the finest work I have ever seen. Each actor brings her or his own special talents and the sum is far greater than the parts. Stew is brilliant and poignant and real, with the courage to bleed. This is his story and its intelligence, importance, humor, anger, love and redemption will draw you in and not let you go. The dancing and the singing are unlike any other you will see-this show rocks and there is just no way that you can stop yourself from rocking with it.You will never forget Passing Strange-I thank Stew, his band (Heidi sings like an angel) and the phenomenal cast (they are all amazing, but Daniel Breaker is a force of his own and I am not sure that it is fair that one person should be allowed to have that much talent) for what each has given me and continues to give every time I watch the DVD.You owe it to yourself to own Passing Strange. Rock on!"
5,Inspiring!,"I've always been a fan of Stew. Lyrically, melodically, his delivery. Top-notch. Never get tired of his music. To see his gift of story-telling work so well with a Broadway-style musical was a revelation. I think this will open the door for others to do similar. Sure it helped Green Day get ther show going. Fantastic cast and band. I didn't see this live, but enjoyed the Spike Lee interpretation. Too bad the run has ended. At least we have this."
2,Buyer beware,"This version is advertised as ""all regions"" but it's actually the Region 4 Brazilian DVD. It will not play in US DVD players. Until there's a US DVD, you're better off looking for the uncut VHS version."
5,my favourite movie of all time,"I saw this movie on tv about 15 years ago and have been searching for it in dvd shops for so long. i saw it on the internet and was so excited to get it on time, and in great condition. i watched it as soon as i recieved it and cried my eyes out. i love it. thankyou so much."
1,Torture porn for anti Christians,"I'm not sure which movie these other reviewers watched but what I got was total B movie schlock which left me praying that it would end shortly after it began. Here are the highlights - one sided attacks on the Word of God that were answered with hopeless giggles by caricatures of the ""elders"" of the church and a contrived ""vow"" of chastity that was followed up immediately with a case of the hots for an ordinary looking girl (the chambermaid looked better than the star of this ridiculous movie.) What I saw in this movie was probably the most weakest willed man in the entire history of France, a nation known for being weak willed. Whoever would cry over this movie is in need of a prescription of Prosac. And a real life. Maybe it was the anti Christian theme that got these 5 star reviewers so excited."
2,PC Gaarfield 3rd Grade Math,"It is cute, however, there is no teaching prior to the activities. For example, measurements - there is a game involving measurements however they do not teach the measurements or provide a chart to refer to. It is just the game and it assumes the children know the conversions already. The same lack of teaching is found throughout the game. The workbook does not provide a chart or teaching tool for this either. It is good as a review of 3rd grade math but not to prepare someone entering 3rd grade."
5,Use This To Test Out Your Blu-Ray Home Theater!,"I've become a fan of the Killers over the past year, and they are proving to be the heir apparent to the likes of U2 and Bruce Springsteen. It's clear they made an investment in producing a state of the art concert film here, and in effect have set a high bar for other bands to reproduce. The visuals are stunning within Royal Albert Hall, with the cameras taking you on a journey from an empty venue to them taking the stage. The sound is amazing, and if you have a surround system, THIS IS the benchmark for testing out your system. Their body of work holds up well over the whole concert. No duds, but for me, some new thoughtfully written songs that I now know!One review I read online by a music critic compared this to Elvis Presley's Hawaii concert film. A very good comparison. However, The Killers, benefit from digital technology that perfects the experience."
5,Happy,"This cd/dvd combo is exactly what I had hoped it would be. The live concert dvd is really amazing and the cd was a nice perk, I wasnt even aware the two were included together. The sound quality of the first couple tracks of the cd are a little less than steller, but the piano version of Sams Town is fantastic. I suggest this cd/dvd to anyone was has yet to see a Killer's live show and is searching for the next best thing."
5,Amazing concert!!!,Just a fantastic concert!!! The blu-ray is amazing. The killers are by far one of the best bands to come out in the last 10 years or so. If you love the killers and you havent seen this yet....what the hell are you waiting for??
2,Disappointed,"I read the positive reviews and bought this. I should have checked the negative review. Regarding the cd, it is an accurate critique. The sound is awful. On a number of tracks, especially ""Spaceman"" and ""When You Were Young, the guitar is barely audible. The DVD is better quality but not great.Steer clear."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"It sounds like they put a microphone right in back of the crowd, and, as with many live concerts, the quality of the sound is very poor. Echos, feedback, audience.....you get it all. Bleh."
4,Where is the bass???,"The show is superb!!! There is a lot of reviews about it. Technically, it has a very good video quality, but the sound... well... its a DTS-Master Audio track, but the sub-woofer channel (LFE) is tooooooo much low. Masterization problem??? Don't know... But my sub-woofer stay quiet, and it works perfectly with another shows I have. Even raising the sub channel level of my receiver, the bass sound makes almost no vibration in my room. When I change the soundtrack to stereo PCM, everything sounds normal like a real The Killers' show, but in DTS-MA the bass is a problem, don't expect much more than a whisper from your sub..."
3,The Killers,CD will not play on car radio or my boat radio. It will play on computerand home cd player.
5,Nice DVD & CD combo,"For the price, this is a great DVD & CD combo. The DVD concert was really nice. The Killers played an awesome set. Plus some songs at a different venue. Watched it everyday for a week when I first got it. Invited a couple of friends over and they raved about it too. They are buying their own copies. The CD takes from the DVD concert. I ripped it to MP3 format and it is on my iTunes now. Jamming to it in the car. Great purchase. If you kinda like the Killers, you gotta get this combo. If you love the Killers, you already know."
4,PHAT!,"Definitely something to have on hand if you're in to club music. Junior Vasquez included ""Do It Again"" on his recently released ""Volume 2"". This will get the crowd, and your heart pounding. Halfway through ""Do It Again"", a deep voice says ""Can you feel it?"" And you hear a heart beating in the background. The beat slows and then speeds up again, saying ""Do it again!"""
4,Beats Eating Yogart!!!,"It took about two weeks, but I could definitely feel a difference. I'm much less bloated and seem to be more ""regular."""
3,Too early to tell,"I've had IBS (C) for over 20 years now, and nothing has worked so far...I've only been taking the biobeads for one week now. However, I recently saw a holistic Doctor and he's recommended that I stop taking this...he's placed me on basically a fruits, vegetables, ground starches (yams, potatos, bananas, etc) diet, cutting out all meats, sugars, salt (except sea salt), processed foods, dairy, etc to flush my body...says all these processed foods are what are causing the bloating, pain, constipation, etc...I don't plan on stopping the biobeads though, so will update in a few months and see how it works with this new diet, or rather this new ""life-style""..."
3,Haven't noticed any digestion changes,"I am a firm believer in natural/holistic/alternative medicine. I think that for the most part going to a regular MD is a death sentence. I also believe that a lot of supplements are not necessary. Some are extremely important of course, but I question the need for others. A wholesome natural diet free from added sugars is natures best medicine & cure for a host of problems.Unfortunately I have taken these probiotics for a very long time and have not noticed a single improvement in digestion. This is very disapointing to me. I don't know if it's the brand & another would be more effective or if it's simply supplement hype (I have tried the pearl brand & it wasn't effective either).I have since explored the SCD (specific carbohydrate diet) with much improvement! If you find that probiotic supplementation is ineffective for you as well, you might want to consider the diet I mentioned. This is not a weight loss diet. It's an intestinal health diet."
3,Not as good as sustenex,I like sustenex better than this. I continue to take sustenex and not bio beads
1,brown rather than ivory coloured BioBeads don't work,"I've been taking these for years for a chronic condition, following my doctor's advice taking 5 a day, and they seemed to help. Recently I got packs with half brown half ivory beads, within the sell-by date. I took them as normal, but after a week or so, the condition for which I take them re-occurred. So I thought maybe the brownish beads have no live cultures in. I opened one, and the oil in there tasted really rancid. I called Natrol, they told me the brownish color is normal and does not affect the effectiveness of the product. Somehow I don't believe this, especially as it never happened for years, is not stated on the pack, plus given my own experience. Does anyone else have experience with the brown coloured ones? (I returned what I hadn't used. I had ordered from Swanson.)Natrol BioBeads Probiotic Acidophilus Complex, Dietary Supplement, Beads, Value Size , 90 beads"
1,"Good Product, Bad Supplier",The product is very good when taken before the expiration date. Discount Drugs send outdated or nearly outdated product. Buy from another company. I love the BioBeads & have switched vendors.
3,Quality.,"I bought 30 pack of similar product for the same price and wanted something cheaper. I got those Biobeads shipped from Amazon, and the exp. date is good, but they don't look fresh like the other product I bought in Whole Foods. The beads are not clear, they look more milky on one side. I have no idea if this is normal, but have my doubts. I don't think I'm gonna purchase those again online, but I couldn't find them in WF, Walmart, Walgreens, CVS. Next time I just will try different brands."
2,Okay game with great characters,"Gave this to my 11 year old for his birthday - he thinks its fun, enjoys the music and the many different characters. The only draw back is you can't save the game. It has to be restarted every time you turn it on. Would have rated it higher if the game could be saved - he would play it more often."
3,Not that helpful if traveling beyond England,"I bought this book as a guide for a family vacation to Ireland. While I expected that much of the book would focus on England I was disappointed when I saw just how little of the publication actually applies to Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Additionally the focus appeared to be on major population centers so those planning to travel the countryside may find little or no value in lugging this heavy paperback around in their suitcases."
2,Remaster this thing!,"The original recording is obviously priceless, but the transfer to CD is just awful- especially in the first few cuts. I thought something was wrong with my CD player at first. They really ruined this recording for any kind of aficionado. You can tell by the price that it has been treated as a throwaway. They should go back to the original master and do it again now that the process is more bulletproof these days."
4,Joe's Jam,"If you love Joe Pass, you'll enjoy this recording. Similar to other Pass recordings, this one sounds very spontaneous and it is fun to listen to. It does sound rough at times in terms of the production of the CD, especially the drums, however the quality of the jam is outstanding. Playing a mix of old time standards including such favorites as Ray Charles'""Sweet Georgia Brown,"" Pass and Ellis weave catchy, blues based solos,playing off each other brilliantly. The two compliment each other effectively, each pushng the other to greater improvisational heights. What emerges is a fun and simple jam between two guitarists who are not afraid to stretch the boundaries of their styles."
3,"Excellent playing, so-so recording","The playing of all involved is excellent. Unfortunately, the recording is not at the same high level. It sounds like the guitar signals were too hot, thereby causing some distortion. Also, the cymbals sound funny. Still worth it...because the playing is so great."
3,These are kirigami models!!,"This book has very creative models, but all of them are kirigami(cut paper), not really pure origami, and all the models require lots of diferent size papers. The photos are good. The book is expensive."
4,Mandy,"MandyBy Julie Andrews EdwardsReviewed by Lily PenderyI enjoyed reading the book Mandy, by Julie Andrews Edwards, immensely. This delightful children's book is about an orphan girl named Mandy. She is longing for a real home, even though she loves the orphanage that she has lived in for many years. She is also desiring a place to call her own for once.One day, she climbs over an old wall to explore what is on the other side. She comes across an little abandoned cottage. She takes a few ""borrowed"" items from the orphanage to clean it up. However, she doesn't tell anybody about it. She wants it to be hers, and no one else's. One day, she falls very sick, but she returns to her cottage. No one knows where she is, except for a mysterious admirer that she never knew she had.Mandy is a great book for children for all ages. The author does a magnificent job creating the character, Mandy and her beloved friends. If you love books about little adventures, you will adore this book!"
5,"This is a book that I think about often, 20 years later!!!","I read this book when I was 10 while listening to Elton John's ""Empty Garden"". Every time I hear that song, I remember ""Mandy"". I became Mandy and I can still see that beautiful cottage. I loved this book and urge anyone to read it!"
5,A girl who called her own,"I thought it was a wonderful book to read. It me feel like I could not put the book down. Well one day when Mandy went over the orphanage wall and she sees a cottage she gets so exited. Also all through spring, fall and summer Mandy works to make it her very own She doesn't like to tell any one about it .But when she gets sick and know one can find her expect a extraordinary friend she never new she had. I loved is book because you can read it over and over again. I recommend this book to kids 9 and up. It was a great book. I hope you read it."
5,"When you need a good book, read this....",I don't think I will ever find any book written with such a wonderful ending!!!!!!! I like Mandy because she is so mischevious.
5,Rediscovered,"Read this when I was a kid and never forgot about it. Recently rebought it through Amazon and it was worth the read. Definitely a good book for children, especially those dealing with adoption issues. Mandy is a complicated girl who can help put a kids problem into perspective or else allow you to empathize. Thumbs up."
5,A young girls secret cottage,I think this book was read to me in school many many years ago. I remembered it as an adult and purchased it for sentimental reasons. I think it reminded me of The Secret Garden in a way. The seashell cottage was the perfect hideaway that every little girl could dream of making her own. I loved the story of Mandy and found myself wistfully wishing that I had a place like that as a child. What a wonderful story that Julie Andrews has created. I will cherish it always and keep it to pass down to the young girls in my family.
5,Mandy in film,I loved the book Mandy. I have ever since I was a little girl and read it for the first time. I vaguely remember seeing it in film form and have been desperately trying to find it ever since! Has anyone heard of it???
5,Great book!,"Even in second grade, I could fully understand this book and its plot. The author chose great words and shows quite a bit of talent. The story of a 10-year-old orphan who finds a cottage over the high stone wall and devotes all her free time to restoring it and the garden. To keep her secret, she lies and even steals. This book is exciting and good for readers of all ages."
4,Mandy is about a girl who has a secret cottage.,"Mandy is about a ten year old girl who lives in an orphanage. She has always been wondering what is over the wall that surrounds the orphanage. She keeps on disappearing from the orphanage, because she has climbed over the wall to find out what is over the wall. She is happy that she found out what is over the wall. Later there is an admirer; she is trying to find out who that admirer is. Read and find out for yourself!"
5,A REALLY good book,"I love this book. So does my best friend. I loaned it to her when we were in 5th grade, and she didn't give it back till this year (7th grade)!! Don't laugh, but after the 1st time my mother read it to me, Heather (my best friend), Dale (her brother), Shalisa, and I did renditions of it called ""The Many and Sue Adventures"". We had lots of fun. But if you like places of your own, go get ""Mandy"" NOW!!"
5,I absolutely adored this book!,I read this book when I was in about 4th grade and have loved it ever since. I used to pretend I had a little cottage of my own in my backyard just like Mandy did. This is a beautiful and heartwarming book for young readers as well as old.
5,I loved this book!,I read this book when I was 10 years old. I had a very bad home life and it took me to a happy place. I wished I could be Mandy and have my own little cottage all for myself.
3,Kind of bland,"This book is kind of bland (of course, if you're reading this, you already know that that's my opinion.) It's a good English story, but it's definitely not for you if you like a story with an involved plot."
5,Synopsis,"In this suspenseful detective drama, a police detective's personal involvement with a beautiful widow takes a professional turn when she is accused of murdering her husband. The gumshoe feels it is his job to prove her innocent."
4,Frantic and Enjoyable,"This is one of the most daring versions of C Jam Blues I have heard by the Ellington crew . . . so much so, that it is difficult to tell if the soloists are actually part the Ellington Orchestra. Ad Lib on Nippon is also very well played. My only gripe is that the sound is not the best. On certain songs it sounds like the mic is very close to Sam Woodyard's hi-hats. This is only problematic on the intros of a few songs. With the energy the group puts out, and the nearly free price, it is worth it!"
1,"Hi Leweez10, Its ME again!","O.K. I never really said that I hate Bratz. I Like everything! So, All you have to do is stop writing bad things about my scene dolls. We didnt write bad things about Bratz dolls until you Bratz lovers started dissing my scenes!So, to be a better and more mature person, Dont write bad stuff about things that other people like.

AND THE ALL-LEATHER OUTFIT IS WAY COOL. YEP I WOULD ACTUALLY BUY HER! TOO BAD SHE'S NOT AVAILBELE NOW. :-(

1,"hi Leweez10, We wrote ugly and fat like Leweez10!","Well, Leweez10, what you just wrote was very extremely weird. You are telling us that just because we dont like this doll, that it doesnt mean that other people like you, Leweez10,dont like it so we should not ruin it for you. Well , according to the My Scene area of this site, you have been totally dissing the My Scene dolls. You've written tons of horrible stuff about them. So , what I wrote about your Bratz dolls was just a comeback for what you did. So its your fault. So what I am trying to say is Stop dissing My Scene dolls. Thats all I have to say."
3,BRATZ AND MY SCENE ARE BOTH COOL,"Bratz and my scene are both cool so please bratz fans stay on the bratz bit, it is very anouying. Though this doll has very big lips, and dynamic, What kind of name is that? This doll also has a very unusal outfit, just like Barbie crip and curls outfit, [although her outfit is ever so slightly prettier that dynamic Chloe's outfit] She also [acouriding to the pictures] only comes with one accseorie, but if you do want to get a my scene doll, may I recomand Barbie my scene goes Hollywood, she is the best doll in the Hollywood collection [in my opion]."
1,"Hi leweez10, or should I say Morgan! Wa ha ha ha ha!","Its me! How old are you ? write back! Im 13, and my little sis who is writing this too is 10. You can call us Lilo and Stich!

2,This is NOT a very good book on Push Tech.!!!!,"Everytime I try to use the book to solve a minor problem, I find a superficial overview. A good example is the chapter on forms; it says nothing about how to implement a secure form a BIG requirement if you're taking credit card numbers on your site. This book was not worth the money I spent, The CD is worth about $10.00. Most of what is on the CD you find on the web for FREE!! I have been using it for about a month now and am doing better by trial and error. NetScape Communicator4.50 is much easier to use and you can write and edit your own HTML. This program I use to build very nice sites and all servers accept it. I would be very cautious about buying another book like this again, O and if you are using a MAC you can forget about any help from it."
5,Excellent resource for creating web sites using FrontPage!!!,I found this book to be all I needed to get to work on creating web pages using FrontPage. I especially liked the comprehensive examples that allowed me to work thru the various elements of putting a web page or site together. The more advanced features were described in enough detail to give a good understanding without going so deep that I felt overwhelmed. I hope these two authors collaborate on a book for the next version of FrontPage!
5,"An easily understood, comprehensive reference.","I am a new user of FrontPage 98 and a new web developer for my company and myself. I needed a reference that would explain how to do what I wanted to do, cover tips not in the on-line help, and suggest ways to jazz up my web presentation. This reference covered all points. It provides a CD with many helpful and useful scripts, themes, and FrontPage components to enhance your project. It breaks down the information into easily understood and logical sections. The tutorials are step-by-step and fully explained. It even covers how to develop your own themes and templates. The tutorial on MS Image Composer was invaluable. I can highly recommend this book to the new FrontPage user. I don't think you'll find a better reference anywhere."
2,overpromises and underdelivers,"I know I'm a bit late in reviewing this book, which I bought in 1998, however I think this is probably the beginning of Microsoft's huge failure in the internet (browser, services, mobile, etc). Microsoft actually got it right with Internet Explorer, capturing circa 90% share because it was a better browser than netscape and the like. However, instead of keeping up that way, they wanted to rule the internet with monopolistic tricks, boycotting other products and Front Page was not an insignificant element in this strategy as in those days the way you built a website was seen as another (or ""the"") way to force users to use internet explorer. Again...no push, no services, no embedded java, nothing like that, therefore you couldn't use the very basic internet features of the day. I remember having gone to flash and dreamweaver because of that. So, bottom line, the book is not bad, what was bad was Front Page 98."
2,Not very helpful to Mac users.,"I found this book to be very technically detailed in the use of Front Page 98. However, it seems that this book (and EVERY other one I've seen for Front Page 98) is written for an IBM platform. Many of the options that supposedly work for an IBM are not available or don't work for the Mac user, which further frustrates those who are new to Front Page 98. Additionally, none of the freebies on the CD-ROM work on a Mac. MAC USERS BEWARE and figure the software out yourself."
4,Good all round book,"I got this book when i first started using front page and well, it went a bit too far for me. Now, i am a Web Master and decided to set up an Intranet using FP98. This is where this book came in use.I would say go and buy this book, but only if you have a goal to reach. It is not your ""click here and now here"" book."
4,Fantastic Web Resource!!!,"This book is by far the best I have seen on the market for Frontpage. It is a good 3 inches or more thick of easily understood information. Combine this book with a basic HTML book, and you are on the right track. I would recommend it to everyone. The CD is great too. Worth the price of the book alone."
2,Expect some disappointments,I started to give 5 stars until I got to the Active Server Pages section. I've tried over and over. Can't get Hello World. Something must be missing plus I still dont have a clear picture of ASP. Guess I'll have to dig deeper.
3,Incorrect image,"Note that the description of this item appears to be the soundtrack of the original first season series (just titled Underbelly), whereas the product image is of the second series (Tale of Two Cities). Not sure how the different sellers will have interpreted this, you may want to check with whatever seller you choose to make sure you get the one you want."
2,High Definition greatly degraded,I applied the glarebuster to the screen and as advertised it removes 90+ percent of the reflected light. The by product of diffusing the light hitting the front of the screen is the TV images are degraded to where our high definiton signals became standard definition and standard definition signals became fuzzy. If you are in a situation where it is impossible to watch TV due to the glare then this product will make it possible to watch without glare. If your intent is to reduce the glare during daylight TV watching then I suggest find other means to filter the light. We scraped the coating off the first night due to the degraded picture quality.
3,The instructions are horrible!,"WARNING! If you buy this cart, once you get it, good luck on putting it together. The instructions are terrible. They are not clear at all as to how the cart is put together, and some main pieces are not even pictured on the instructions. So unless you are a person very good at putting things together, I would avoid this cart to save you a lot of frustration and wasted time."
3,very understanble book,"This book is a very well-understandble to everyone. There is no need to know more things about this isue, this book covers almost everything. I believe that it is one good book for the start."
2,General info. resource,"Does have some insight into sadomasochism but lacks a complete psychological examination. It fell short of real psychological depth, I felt."
3,Semi-helpful,"The first six chapters are helpful and contain useful information about the use of Language from the Center and from the Edge. However, the next two chapters are simply the author's social commentary about not pre-judging people on their differences in communication. The last chapter is just an overview of the study of linguistics."
1,Not helpful,"This book was full of everyday scenarios, which were interpreted in a very narrow way to show the author's point. The connections between the examples and her points were vague at best. The real problem with this book is that it would only appeal to those with very little self-confidence, and if that person took the advice to heart the result would be laughable."
3,Street of Dreams minus Street of Dreams,"Patti Austin is a wonderful, fantastic, beautiful, talented and versatile singer. Unquestionably, her talent deserves '5 stars.'However, is it my imagination or does this CD contain the very same songs as her STREET OF DREAMS CD - minus the title song - and at the same price?If so, I give this collection '1 star' for disappointing those of us who were looking forward to a new - or at least varied - collection of songs.However (to end on a positive note), with either CD you choose, you simply can't lose. Ms. Austin gives each of these songs fantastic treatments. The outstanding selections (IMHO) are her fresh approach to ""For Once in my Life,"" and her passionate versions of ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" and ""Look What You've Done to Me."""
2,ok,songs ok i have heard better Love songs should have words and phrases with deep meaning and musical arrangements that fit those words and a voice mature enough to handle it
4,very good collection,Patti Austin is One of the Most slept on Artists over the past 25 plus years easily. her voice is with anyone who has Brought feeling&Depth to Singing.this colllection finds Her in fine form vocally&she is still a voice that stands out from the crowd.Patti Austin is still Smooth with Her presentation.
1,Do Not Buy,"Not worth the money. It's not soft, its like wearing sand paper. I ended up buying a different one. Get the Hugo Boss"
2,Oversold tripe,"This time travel ""romance"" was a waste of my time! The time travel science was redundantly stated without any science in support. The characters were extremely stereotypical, including the pasty heroine and predictable Gil. The ""heroes"" erected more than a four or more kisses in 274 pages!! Find another time travel novel for your entertainment. BORINGGGGGG!"
4,Good information,I really liked this book a lot. It gave me some great pointers on my recent first-time trip to Yosemite. The only reason I didn't give the book a full 5 stars is because of the binding. Just a few days into my trip the center pages started to fall out. Not great for a book you take with you in your camera bag while you're hiking at a national park. The major points of interest were covered as well as seasonal activity.
2,Book needs an Update,"Was a good book, however the book was written over 11 years ago and is past its prime. Written with a focus on film (including an entire chapter on choosing the correct film). Moon and Sun tables found in the appendix only go up to 2010."
4,Very good,"Great breakout album. If the whole album were as good as the highlights, this would be a solid 5 stars. Still a very worthy purchase even if only for the highlights."
5,I Love Orgy,"i have both vapor and candyass and i have to say that candyass is better. unlike vapor candyass stays true to the coined ""death pop"" and i really enjoy the synth. it gives thier music a futuristic hardcore sound which i enjoy. Jay gordon has a one of a kind sexy voice and amazing writing talents, the lyrics are fantastic!! all i have to say is that this cd is a MUST HAVE!!!"
