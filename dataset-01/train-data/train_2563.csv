3,Just a glass...,The glass is thin so they probably won't last long with me. I am visually impaired and wanted to get away from the stemware. I really don't care for these. Trial and error. I really want a polycarb wine glass.
5,"Great for price, fast shipping!","I ordered this a few days before Christmas (I don't need them till New Years) and received it Christmas Eve, standard shipping! Exactly what the description said and great for the price I paid!"
3,Stick with Cha Cha Glasses,"These glasses are nice, but you can't beat the designs of ChaChaWare!This Holiday Season I recommend 100% American Made glassware at [...]"
3,This is the true story of Jill Coit,"The author describes Jill Coit's life as it was - however, I liked the book ""Charmed to Death"" better. I had to deal with Coit while working at the correctional facility and all I can say this that she continues to play her games with everybody in prison... if she does not get want she wants she finds ways to mess with the staff and threatens with law suits! She plays the staff against each other - but else is there to do for her? She got life without parole, that is her way of keeping busy in prison. There is also a movie out about her, but I was only able to get it from the United Kingdom on a European format DVD."
1,I'm VOWING never to read this book again!,"My major complaint with this book is that there isn't any completion to any part of the story. The main character marries man after man, dumps him, moves on to another victim, etc. There is no carry through with the separation, divorce, murder etc. Even when the ""black widow"" is brought to trial, the author ends the book reporting that she and her cohort have been fould guilty of murder in the first degree, but there's isn't an account of the sentencing phrase of the trial.The whole book is a series of ""left up in the air."" More time and atttention should have been devoted to finalizing the relationship with each husband.This said, the book is very well-written. The author moves the text along at a steady pace, but the chapters are a little too lengthy."
2,Betrayed...,"I enjoyed the first Triology of Rabe's becuase of the cast of characters and their mission. The Dhamon Saga is more about the main character feeling sorry for himself and damming everyone else. He has a single minded mission to save his own sorry a$$ by getting the dragon scale removed and little else. I find Rig and Fiona a lot more interesting than Dhamon.If you haven't read the first book... pass on this like you would a bad batch of chilli fries, because you won't care for the character.And if you haven't read Jean Rabe's first Triology that introduces the characters, you really really should avoid this series.Now if you need something to put you to sleep and a firm blow to the head isn't your style......"
3,Not as good as Downfall,"This book starts out boring and well...dull but then gradually gets better as the story pans out. This book does have some cool villians, Nura Bint-Drax and Maab the Mad are interesting and exciting. Looking forward to Book 3..."
5,"WELL WHAT COULD I SAY ""I LOVE IT""","WELL I CANT SAY NOTHING BUT,THAT YOU GUYS DID A GOOD JOB BY DOING OR MAKING THIS C.D CAUSE THAT I KNOW IT GETS EVERY ONE ON, AT ALL OF THE PARTIES I'VE BEEN TO . IT IS A BAD, LIKE MEANING A REALLY GOOD C.D SPECIALLY BY THAT MUSIC NAMED(CALIENTE,CALIENTE).WELL KEEP UP THE GOOD JOB.""I LOVE YOU GUYS"" BYE BYE.""GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING YOU GUYS DO."
4,Definitely a marathon not a sprint.,I found this book to be entertaining but it gets lost meandering in the hills and dales along with our hapless duo. Very redundant and long winded but also a very beautiful style of writing.
1,THIS MOVIE IS CRAP BUT IT MAKES ME LAUGH!,"The movie has to be the most biggest pill of S@#% I have ever seen! Bad acting, The screenplay is hilariously awful, The movie has it all! The dumb sluts and dumb parents!Its sad to say the little girl is the only one with the balls in this movie to do something! The part in this movie that makes me laugh is that ghost knows how to use a nail gun! I also love it when they set her on fire at the end...in fact the whole movie is a joke! When I stoped taking the movie seriously I couldn't help but laugh it! I would rather watch ""Darkness Falls"" then watching this again. But if you like bad horror movies then watch this movie! THIS MOVIE IS CRAP BUT IT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH!P.S. I wouldn't even give it one star but Amazon wouldn't let me"
1,Not What You Expect,"If you have heard of this book you are probably already familiar with Caro's ""The Power Broker"" and are looking for firsthand Robert Moses.Unfortunately, this book is not it. In Caro's words (and I'm paraphrasing): Public works is not an autobiography and it certainly isn't by Robert Moses.I completely agree. The book is mostly a puff piece. It is primarily a collection of articles, letters, editorials, and press release by RM, mostly PR and fluff. The other 10% of the book, the actual writing about Robert Moses and public works, was written by his flunkies and isn't very perceptive.Again Caro said it best when he called this ""a nonbook."" There are only two good reasons to buy this book (and I'm not poo-poohing either of them): 1. you want a piece of Moses memorabilia or 2. for some reason you are interested in reading RM's press releases, public articles, etc."
3,Too many typos and other mistakes - no help from publisher,"If you are trying to learn from this book - don't! I am sure that there are others that are better.I'm using this book as a text for Visual Basic 6 class. The further you get into the book, the more mistakes (especially in the code for the exercises!). One Exercise (Chapter 11) was so riddled with mistakes that it was a guessing game.I don't expect everything to be spelled out.I do expect the example code to be complete, consistent and correct. Fortunately, I have a great teacher.Also, most good books/publisher have a website where you can download errata/corrections to the mistakes and typos in the book. Prentical Hall has purchased the book. If there is a correction page, I couldn't find it. I usually can find such pages since I have worked in the publishing business."
4,Not just for Beginners,"This book is for someone who already knows another programming language e.g Java, if you don't look for a beginners book. Its Ok for Quick results but remember the first four chapters are missing on the CD, but overall its a good buy."
1,Worse book ever!,This book is not for beginners. Worse ever for beginner not enough to support all the examples. Don't buy this book is your a beginner.
4,The Happy Birthday Die is a Dud,"I have this set and I like it just fine, except that I cannot get the Happy Birthday one to cut properly. I have tried that particular die using several types of paper, and I have tried it using every possible setting on the Big Shot, including with and without the mats -- and it doesn't cut through the paper well enough to remove the shape without tearing or ripping. If I am doing something wrong, I hope someone will explain the procedure. I wanted the Happy Birthday die more than the other three in the package."
3,Wasn't what I was hoping,"I have a Vidal Sassoon blow dryer, so since this diffuser said universal I figured it would fit, no problem. Well, I was wrong, it doesn't fit. I was still able to hold it up to my blow dryer for use, but it still doesn't work as well as I thought it would, so I was disappointed."
5,MALMSTEEN IS GAWD!,"This is the Best of the BEST! One of the top 3 Vocalists. One of the top 2 Keyboardists. And, THE BEST GUITARIST, Ever! Better than the CDs. Better than the mind can imagine. I'd purchase this at double the price. (And, let ANYONE who says otherwise do better.) Play On, my talented Friend."
3,Eye Toy Groove,"The Eye Toy Groove game is well suited to people who used to making a fool of themselves (like for the Eye Toy play) I loved this game but did not rate it as highly as the first Eyetoy game(which I thought was great), because it was less challenging. The best part about the game is when you are dancing,and the game goes onto another screen which records you dancing, so afterwards you can watch yourself and cringe."
1,...,"Come on! IT HAS 28 TRACKS! Get DDR Extreme. It has eyetoy support, ***70*** songs, many totally hip feautures, and that good ol DDR name. So you see my point? This is more like a quarter of DDR Extreme. (hmm. Which is what you pay for :0 )Well, my work here is done."
2,Essential Nothing,"I am a big fan of premier league dj's such as Pete Tong(who normally does the Essential series) Carl Cox, Sasha, Digweed, and Oakenfold. I bought this cd just for the music. Now i have to say, he does have decent tune choice, but his mixing is not like his live mixing. He did this on pro tools. For all of you people who think DJ Skribble is da bomb, think again. Go buy the DJ Icey or the PETE TONG ESSENTIAL SELECTIONS for a better idea of what dance music is all about. (p.s. when are you going to learn how to mix songs the right way skribble?)2 stars for the Tunes."
1,I thought dj's were supposed to be able to mix!,"This cd has your radio friend dance songs, which is fine, but I guess anybody can make a mix cd these days. When I buy a dj mix cd i expect it to be mixed, not one track fading into another. Do yourself a favor and save your money for something better. Unless you don't care about the mixing!"
3,Zombie Nation errors,"for some people's information, the GROUP is KernKraft 400. The SONG is Zombie Nation... if you lsiten closely to the original (I'm not sure if you can hear it in the remix) you can hear ... zombie... zombie... zombie... zombie nation... over and over again. It might sound something like ""Tumbenation"". Anyway the CD is ok not a big fan of dance music just of some of the artists on this."
5,This cd is the best!,"I bought this CD the day it came out, and I play it every day!These are the best tracks ever! Quality mixing! dj Icey is good, but skribble is the best!"
2,Is Scribble Really a DJ?,"Okay, so I know that everyone loves Scribble. He's a well known scratcher, and that's great. However,DJing is NOT all scratching. I bought this CD because I had heard it was awesome. I do like most of the songs on it, but I found the flow to be jerky and poorly thought out. I also think this CD is a clear demonstration of DJ Scribble's lack of mixing skills. I got rid of this CD after 2 days. Like I said, the songs are good, but do not flow together in their current order. Also, Scribble can barely mix. I am so glad Pete Tong helped him with his Spring Break Essential. If you want some good Scribble, check that out. That CD has good flow and the mixing is so much better."
4,"Essentially, an essential collection for the 2000 yr.","Ok, why is this CD getting such a bad rap? Categorically, this is definitely a Big-Beat album. Which is EXCELLENT if you don't want total techno sounding music nor pop hits galore. It's a great album to put on at any party and will surely please everyone. Skribble takes some of the year's obscure dance hits, ""Till i come""-ATB and some overrated/overplayed mainstay hits as well, i.e ""Sexual""-Ambre & Cher's ""Believe"" from last year.One thing that dissapoints me is that most of the songs are shortened because they're lengthy. Only 2-minutes for ATB's instant classic Till i Come?"" Gimme a break! But, i can see why they are shortened--there's 17 tracks here. Don't wait for it to enter the used bins and miss out on the action.For under $20, from a qualified DJ, this is worthwhile."
3,A nice surprise...,I bought this CD not knowing what to expect. I had heard some stuff by DJ Skribble's and thought why not? Some of the tracks are great while others lack a certain...something. My fav. tracks are #'s 11 & 12. This is a great CD for those only familiar with the club scene. Overall it's not a bad CD but it won't stay in my CD player constantly.
2,"BAD Mix!, but good selection","Despite the good song selection you will find the flow to be jerky and poorly thought out. I also think this CD is a clear demonstration of DJ Scribble's lack of mixing skills. It is almost like listenin to tracks on a CD player in random mode, no mixing, no flow, you will like the songs but, with such a bad flow come on... Anybody can pick those songs but the mixin, well ... ..."
2,Kind of a let down,"I've heard so many good things about this DJ, although after buying this CD I noticed that his mixing skills are really not all that great. Some of the songs sound awkward blended together, and the track selection isnt the greatest either.I should have waited to buy this on the clearance rack."
1,Should be titled a Ruud Gullit Love Fest,"Fans of Gullit will no doubt find this book interesting. I was just disappointed in this purchase.This is a book written by someone who appears to be very close to both Ruud Gullit and his representatives and gives, what I think is a very one sided account of what happened during Gullit's reign at Newcastle. Had I known that, I never would have bought this book. I didn't want to read another ""biography"" from Harry Harris of someone who came close to leading a great club down to the First Division."
2,lousy eq,"For those ""horn band fans"" of the 70's this is a must have CD. Mainly because it's the only CD!For some reason it is not available on a domestic label. The sound is awful. There was no EQ done to the transfer which results in a gutless sound. The trumpets still sound great even if the band sounds like their playing from the other room."
4,"Great Music, Fair Audio Quality",I have the original LP but no turntable to play it on so I got the MP3 download. I still like the music but it lacks bass and it sounds muffled in the lower ranges.
3,Chase CD Review,"The shipment arrived on time with no problems. The quality of the CD recording was somewhat lacking. Bass reproduction had no depth and the track ""Open Up Wide"" had a background 60 hz hum. Regardless, it was still good to hear Bill Chase approach low-earth orbit with his trumpet."
2,brake handle to small,unless you brake with 2 fingers i would not buy it. It is there low end from shimano
4,"Lots of information for the 1st-time, small acreage farmer",The Gregsons came from an urban life out to make a small farm. Through many trials and errors (which they humbly share) they have found a successful formula for earning a sustainable income from a few acres. This is a must read for anyone considering a CSA farm.
3,Okay,"This is an ok gun. It is great for beginers and I do recommend it for a first airsoft gun. I bought this gun about 3- 4 weeks ago and the bottom opener for the battery's has already broken. It only shoots 150 fps, so it is a great beginer's gun, but not much more than that. It's made of plastic and looks nothing like any of the images shown. The gun has terrible aim, and skips a ridiculous amount of rounds. it only holds about 40 bb's and they are gone in a second's notice. It's horrible for wars, so don't buy it for one. Here are some pros and cons:Pros:- good for beginners- good priceCOns:- it skips rounds- only 150 fps- horrible aim- only holds 40 bb's- made of cheap chinese plastic- it doesn't last very long- horible for warsp.s. I have had this gun for 3 weeks, kept it in perfect condition, and it broke."
4,Good quality for a great price.,"I purchased two of these guns about two weeks ago and received both very quickly from hotimporttoys.com. They work quite fine and fire at about 200fps, but I was unaware that they did not come with the laser attachments that are pictured. However the company has promised to ship these to me free of charge, which I find wonderful. They were quite helpful and I would recommend purchasing from them because of this.Keep in mind though these guns are not.....repeat....not supposed to come with the laser attachments."
2,"Crap, sort of.","Shoots fast, and thats about it. You get what you pay for and thats how this is. It dosen't feel good in my hand. The impact is pretty weak as well."
3,"Buy for fun, not to fight TM's","They Really should change the description of the gun. There is no way any of these guns are even closer to TM and if you are looking for a cheap ""TM"", invest in a UTG at 100 dollars as opposed to 300 dollars. The only electric guns that have any chance of competing with Tokyo Mauri's/ Classic Armies are UTG's. This gun is much better for introduction to airsoft or back yard fights. If you are looking for a cheap gun to have alot of fun with, buy this. If you are looking for a gun to compete with high end airsofters, buy a UTG."
4,Sweet Gunnnnn!!!!!!!!!,I just got this gun like 3 days ago. i have tryed it out a couple times and all i know is that it is the gun i was looking for in airsoft wars. it might not have that much FPS (only 160) but it still hurts. i was suprised with how loud the gun was also. the only down side to the gun was that the gun only holds like 40 rounds but other than that its a great well rounded gun. it was a great buy for me and the range is amazing! i would prefer this gun to anyone into airsoft and its a great secondary gun in warsand tons of fun!
4,Good book for the beginner and the experienced Whistler.,I have read this book and have used it to teach people to whistle. I had the pleasure of receiving my copy from the author him self. David did a great job this is the book to learn how whistle. Unless you have a pro whistler handy to give private lessons. I am a two time Grand Champion Whistler this is the book to start with.
2,Out of Date,This book comes with a RECORD! I haven't had a record player in a decade so the usefulness was limited. It could be terrific but without a record player I will never know.
3,AMERICAN SOUL (vol. 1),"YES. i recieved this dvd, but here are the problems: dvd plastic covering is worn & old looking (yet dvd is advertised as NEW), I ordered both vol.'s 1 & 2, and the covers are DIFFERENT, also this is a hosted MUSIC CONCERT & i'm ONLY INTERESTED in MUSIC VIDEOS, finally there is NO TRACK LISTING, so your RATING is a 3 (NEITRAL) for ALL the reasons i stated already."
1,The real tragedy is not coming up with an original band name.,Rick Derringer and/or Derringer have been recording since the 60s...why not call youselves Boston?
5,A must reading for all of us who work with Jesuits,"The book is written in a novel format with each chapter being a true story of Jesuits who represent the times. The author is very objective and while he praises the Jesuits throughout history, he also points out their flaws. The historical accounts and the social context of each puts a real face on the Society of Jesus. The reader comes to identify with and understands better why these men were both loved and feared, how they took courageous stands, yet backed down when they should have stood strong. It is a social history as well as a political history of the Church as well as the Jesuits."
4,Mr. Big & Big Misunderstandings,"The review by ""Mr. Big,"" which for some reason appears twice, is so riddled with inaccuracies and errors that it is unworthy of Amazon.com. The references to the Jesuits as ""popes"" is sickening. The one thing that Jesuits have never been is ""popes."" Lacouture's book is obviously too big for ""Mr. Big.""Fortunately, the other reviews are more reflective of the book and of Jesuit history."
5,every Living Colour fan must own this DVD,"This Paris Concert DVD is so so good. Will Calhoun's drum solo at approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes into the set, followed immediately by an extended version of ""Flying"" are the unrivalled blessings of this collection of great Living Colour Music. The entire concert is great, but all my fellow Living Colour fanatics will understand what I mean about ""Flying"" after they view it just once. This is a must buy for any true fan. Go buy it!"
2,Disappointing,"We used to have a telescoping graden shovel that lasted for many years. When it finally broke, I bought this for my wife. She bent the trowel head on the first day using it. I'd gladly pay 3x the price for one that wouldn't bend or break -- the old one was her favorite garden tool."
2,Good idea - catch needs improvement,"The concept of a garden trowel with extendable handle is a great idea. However, they need to improve the locking mechanism. It will stay extended for light work, nice loose dirt, but when encountering your usual garden soil it tends to begin to collapse. You have to watch which way you are applying pressure. If you twist it to the left it will loosen."
3,Not so great at staying extended ...,"A nice enough trowel, but every time I extended the handle and ""twisted"" it to lock it into place ... it wouldn't stay locked; I wouldn't realize this, would push the trowel into the ground, and almost fall over as the handle slid back down to base of the tool! Having bad knees I really wanted a portable trowel that could be used at both of its advertised lengths. However, more than anything I needed it in the extended position. At home I extended it, locked it into place, and used very strong epoxy glue (applied into the seam where the locking mechanism is, as well as all around the outside of said seam) on it ... so now, while it's a little unwieldly to tote around at least I can use it without any further suprises! The rubberized grip at the top of the trowel is handy, especially in damp weather."
4,"Not his best, not his worst","The Satch has a sound and style that I will never get tired of. It is criminal that he did not make Rolling Stones top 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time (Let alone top 30) issue and Springsteen did (don't get me wrong, Bruce is easily in the top 10 greatest songwriters of all time, but ""guitarists?????????"" Wouldn't even make my top 200 maybe even 300 list).I look to Satriani for unadulterated, blazing hot, electric (figuratively), virtuosity in guitar playing. Yes, he has more depth than that, and it is heard in examples such as the beautiful ""A Love Eternal"" piece. But some of his more lively tracks on this album were a little flat such as ""Movin' On."" But when he just gets in the groove with a great rhythm like ""It's So Good,"" he just plays so deep in the pocket that it reaches the soul."
5,Not Your Ordinary Xmas Music,I love Scotch/Irish music and Steven McDonald's in paticular. Not glitzy -a nice mix of tempo and mood. The man can do no wrong in my book. I'm happy to add it to my Christmas music collection.
2,Where is Scotland?,"I just reviewed ""A Highland Christmas"" by Eric Rigler, and saw this and hoped it would be what I expected of the other one; so I screened it. It's the same schlock as the other one. That keyboard is really cheesey and permeates the CD. I have heard that the old Scotland is all but dead, but when I see the pipers at Bethlehem Pennsylvania's Celtic Festival, it is hard to believe. But this music tells me to call the coroner. Some-one please produce a Christmas CD with either solo piper, or pipe and drum corps. Throw in indigenous instruments as needed, and lose that keyboard. You may have to get the Scottish artists from the land of Ellis Island."
4,I learned a great deal about using a minimum of markings,"As a writer in mathematics and computer science, I am occasionally required to sketch diagrams describing my work. This is of course difficult, as I have no training in this area. To assist, I consult books on sketching, and this one is quite interesting. These are sketches in the true sense, with a minimum of markings. Mathematics is a field where a minimum of statements is generally the best strategy for explanation. Therefore, I learned a great deal about sketching for mathematics by looking over the diagrams in this book.The sketches depict people in many different activities, from playing cards to dancing. Given this broad coverage of people living their lives, there is much that artists can learn from them as well."
5,ASSSSCAT?,"When I purchased this improv DVD for $10, I didn't have high hopes. Although I have always been a huge fan of UCB, most improv shows I've seen (like Who's Line) have been a lukewarm disappointment.Enter ASSSSCAT.If you are a fan of the type of humor found on the regular seasons of Upright, you will love ASSSSCAT. I watched this with my skeptical girlfriend, and we were both rolling with laughter for two straight hours.Have you ever asked yourself who cut the pizza with toilet scissors? Me either, but you will.This is a bargain, and you owe it to yourself to check it out."
4,Absolutely astounding.,Delfattore takes a case by case study of textbook censorship and what she comes up with is absolutely frightening. Anyone with a will can change the content of school textbooks. This is a must read for teachers!
5,2 volume set of WOMEN are tops!,The two volumes of WOMEN IN HORROR FILMS (1930s and 1940s) are a wonderful addition to the serious horror collection.Both volumes are constantly referred to in my writing on the subject of the Golden Age of Horror.Tops in research is Mr. Mank5 stars.
4,excellent recording,"this is a classic example why bootlegs should exist. the band on their own probably would not release this due to some mudane reason, such as the vocals sound distorted. we would have all missed out on some mighty fine playing and nice long musical improvisions which no longer exists with deep purple. the liner notes believe this was taken off a sound board, and probably so. personally, i like mk I version of deep purple as i like the longer songs. even with only four songs, there is enough hard charging, rockin' music to appeal to any deep purple fan. long live good quality bootlegs!!!"
2,Great Series gone wrong,"I love the Dark Horse series, always have. Dark Horse and Lightening's Daughter were amazing. Valorian was passable, and City, well, it looked really promising. The old charachters were not true to type, and the new charachters... Hebert didn't do enough to really potray the complex charachter of Kelene, and the plot was very generic. The quality of writing also suffered. I was so disappointed with this book that I don't plan on reading Winged Magic, as Herbert seems to be groping for material and quality."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I have all of Joen Wolfrom's quilt books. This book is the most helpful book I have ever read for color. The way the color wheels and how a color can best match up with other colors in the wheel is so easy to understand and use. I will highly recommend it to all my quilting friends. Thank you Joen for enhancing my quilting life. Donna Martinsen. Petersburg, Alaska"
1,Do Not Buy on Kindle,"You have got to be kidding me. A book about color is available on the Kindle??? How terribly terribly wrong. The original book is full of gorgeous colorful photos and quilts (unsurprisingly) and is a fine book. But the book is an absolute joke in black and white. This should not be sold!!! For shame, C&T and Amazon."
5,A Must Have if You Quilt or Craft!,Wonderful book with great information and beautiful quilt examples. A new way to look at color. Great quilting photography with a variety of colors and quilting selections.
5,Good education on color,This is a very informative book and a visual pleasure as well. Good information for quilters of all skill levels.
5,A GREAT BOOK FOR COLORS,"THIS BOOK COVERS IT ALL and then some. The explanation of colors, hues, vibrancy & textures makes understanding the ""WHY(s)"" easy.I recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the color combinations and their effects."
5,Played it again and again,"Wow!! What a find. I was blown away by the intricate sounds and rhythms and listened to the CD again and again. A tribal journey around the world, fascinating instruments I'd never heard before, woven together by a hypnotic bass and drumming. Dance/Trance. Singers from all over the world: Native American, Indian, Persian, Tibetan (?), Aborigines. One of my all time favorite albums. Who is global spirit? Why don't we know more about these masterful musicians? Do they have other releases? I couldn't find any. Mysterious, like the music ..."
5,Read and Soar,"This book is wonderful. I really don't like to write, but i find keeping a journal helps me to relax and put things into perspective. I will be able to look back on my journal and see the good things that happened day to day. Sometimes while reading the book you really feel you are in flight with an eagle. Mrs. Sova motivates me to motivate myself. I suggest to cuddle up in bed with no distractions and really concentrate on this book, it could change your path in life!"
2,I love the product but hate the metal,"Item again was badly packaged!! Several cans had dents on them!! As if Bisphenol A used in the coating of the inner lining of the can is not bad enough, i have to deal with the release of metal into the fruit juice from the dents!! I"
5,Great Picture Quality,"No complaints about this puzzle. Pieces fit together well and the overall quality is quite nice. Loved the finished picture. The Christmas tree was a little hard to put together, but isn't that part of the fun :)"
4,nice,"This was a cool puzzle. There are good sections so that multiple people can work on it and not ""steal"" someone else's pieces. Like one person can work on the chimney while another does the presents, and another works on the tree. The tree was probably the hardest part and that was saved for last. Fun puzzle and looks great when completed."
5,Heavenly Music,This exceptional CD produced by the Memphis Boy Choir and Chamber Choir is one of their best ever. The selection of music is unique yet not unheard of. I have been satisfied with every Memphis Boy Choir and Chamber Choir CD I have purchased and this one is no exception. This CD makes the perfect Christmas gift for the learned listener. I can't wait until their next CD.
2,Carpenter's delight,"Don't go near this if you don't know how to put things together. It's a nice piece of furniture, but it comes completely disassembled and the directions for putting it together assume that you have some knowledge of carpentry. There are numerous pieces beyond screws and dowels and the directions are not clear. The pictures are so blurry that you can't see how the screws and dowels position---never mind trying to figure out how a cam-bolt and cam-lock work! If I ever get it together, I'll write a review on the finished product."
4,Spains addition to the Lilith Fair,"First of all let me say I love Spain and everything about it as well as Ella Bella Sola's CD. I was expecting more of a flamenco flavor in their music but was surprised at their more contemporary folk-rock-jazzy sound -- reminds me of many a blurry eyed night-to-morning party in Madrid. The music is soothing with great acoustic guitar / not crazy about the electric keyboard on some songs (thus the four stars). It's a great ""chick"" sing along CD (if you know Spainish) that a guy could very well sweep a girl off her feet with. Get it! Just fast forward past track 4."
3,Good guitars & vocals,"Tracks 1, 5 & 13 I liked the best for rhythm and beat and voice.Track 11 had a lot of potential... but it was cut short."
4,Muy bueno,"Este CD es un exelente comienzo para estas dos chicas guapas que sin usar minifaldas, atraen la mirada y sin cantar palabritas de amor dulces a los oidos de los hombres solos, se los ganan de todas formas. De hecho le cantan a los hombres cantandoles a la mujer, buscan su propia identidad femenina sin caer en feminismos, no buscan la reinvindicacion de la mujer por ser mujer sino que tiran codazos para abrirse camino por ellas mismas. Tratan temas como los ""amores de barra"" que no son romanticos y no lo trata de forma anegdotica contando una historia, sino que lo platican tan asi como si nada. La mejor canción es en mi opinion ""Entra"" quiza porque es la mas metalera, pero tambien tiene una letra muy interesante. En fin, ojala que siguan con este nivel de calidad en cuanto a letras que sin ser profundas ni poeticas son muy buenas."
5,Fabulous for In-your-car Scream Singing,"I lived abroad in Spain for a semester and my Spanish ""sisters"" were always talking about this group. I broke down and bought the album (even though I didn't have a CD player with me) and fell in love with it. I kept it in my car for months and found myself ""scream singing"" to most of the songs, especially Amores de Barra and Mejor Sin Ti-both quite empowering. The songs are upbeat and catchy. If you don't speak Spanish you'll likely pick up the lyrics anyway. A great buy!!"
3,Don't drop it!,"Boy, I would hate to drop this Camo colored knife while out camping.I would NEVER be able to find it!"
5,Beautiful!!,I love all of Steve's CD's! They always take me back in time to the experiences of the Scottish people. I don't know how many times I've cried while listening to his music. The strength and stamina of the Scotts is incredible and Steve's chronicle of their desire for freedom is excellent!
3,maybe historically significant but musically vapid,"Earlier posts about English political superiority aside, I expected something a little more traditionally Scottish sounding. This sounded more to me like the umpteenth iteration of Windham Hill's ""A Celtic [fill in the blank]"". Sure, there were traces of traditional tunes and instruments used as quiet background to the melancholy lyrics but, aside from the implied historical story lines, the music didn't do anything to stir my soul. It's not bad or distasteful, it makes for soothing mood music, but it sounds too Americanized for something titled ""Highland Farewell""."
4,Melodius McDonald,"While this CD doesn't have the impact of ""Sons of Somerled,"" it is still more than worth a listen. McDonald illustrates his love and pride in his Scottish ancestry with every breath, bringing both pathos for the Clearances, and pride in the Scots ability to triumph in the face of adversity. McDonald's work brings unique cultural stamp of the Highlands to all corners of the world--a polar opposite to the original English intent!Bravo!"
2,"Right message, Wrong presentation","I have to say that I enjoyed the segments, but found the funky segment titles very annoying. The interviews are delivering the right message and was repetative enough to make it sink in. I think I was just expecting more from something with Jack Canfield's name on it."
3,Beyond Belief,"I guess I was expecting more emphasis on the Biology of Belief and the ability of changing our beliefwill impact our DNA. I have a great admiration for all the presenters, especially Canfield and Lipton---butthere was too much emphasis on Neuro linguistic Programming for my taste. I felt I was being ""sold""rather than persuaded.Good production and sound quality though. Good organization, although got redundant ater a while for mesince I am a video junkie of this type of genre. Professor B Bullard"
2,"Poorly Produced, Hard to Watch","I'm sure this documentary had good intentions, but it is SO poorly produced that it looks like something I would have put togehter in Media Production Techniques 101 in college 20 years ago. While the information is good, this makes it very had to watch. I kept cringing at the screen with all the bad ""green screen"" moments, VERY basic character fonts and bad resolution. I'm sort of surprised that Marci Schimoff, Jack Canfield, Joe Vitale and others would participate in this. Although, you can't know what something will look like in post-production while you're shooting it. I understand that. For a MUCH for cohesive, in-depth and beautiful presentation of these sampe principles with many of the SAME teachers, PLEASE watch The Secret. It's terrific."
3,"Doesn't compare with ""The Secret""","It certainly does not pick up where The Secret left off. I see something new every time I rewatch The Secret, and I've watched it dozens of times. This one was okay ... mostly pap. Better to watch ""What the Bleep Do We Know?""."
2,Watching the Trailer did not Inspire Me to Rent or Purchase,"The review actually consists of about 1 minute of film. I am a New Thought minister and enjoy metaphysical explorations. I thought ""What the Bleep"" was pretty good. This did not impress me."
1,one hour of my life that i'll never get back...,unbelievably boring...littered with world war II footage. waste of money...
3,Chauvet ZX10 Moonflower scanner,Nice light for a centerpiece. Would not use it all night. Would be nice if they could link in a series. Next purchase will be the LX 10.
5,YUMMY,My kids love taking their vitamins in the morning now. They prefer these much more over the regular chewable. Great taste and I love the 220 size.
2,Please buy a size larger....,"These shoes run terribly small, and not just on my foot as I let a couple other people try them on to test. My advice would be to get a larger size than you normally wear."
4,Think About it,"At Robert E. Lee High School's annual Slave Day fund-raiser, sixty student council members and a few choice teachers are auctioned off to students as ""slaves"" for a day. Eight alternating first-person narratives relate the day's events, allowing eight distinct individuals to emerge from their initially apparent stereotypes-jock, geek, and cheerleader, et al. They all are affected by the day's events and would never be the same again. Rob Thomas did a great job trying to show present day students how life was if they were a ""slave"" or ""master"" during the Slave Trade Era. It is a professional job written in every-day language so it would be better understandable towards high school students."
2,Don't Bother,"I Have read two books by Rob Thomas, ""Rats Saw God"" and ""Slave Day"". Because I Read the former of the two books, ""Rats Saw God"" first, I assumed that Thomas was a fairly good novelist. NOT SO!! Slave Day follows the lives of several different high school students and one high school teacher over the course of one day. The book piles too many subplots into too little a writting space. In one plot, a supposed ""rebel"" deals with an evil teacher. In another, a nerd does all he can to impress the ""hottie"" of the school. The book's content was very depressing, and the ending was FAR TO ABRUPT. When rating this item, I seriously considered giving it a ""3"" because it does have its good points. Unfortunatley, the good points do not outshine its bad points."
2,Rob Thomas fails at an attempt on teen drama in Slave Day,"I found the book ""Slave Day"" by Rob Thomas to be both predictable and dull. It simply used teen stereotypes to tell the story of these high schoolers. The author didn't tell us anything about Tiffany's picture of her grandfather and why she was ashamed of it. You didn't see anything happen between Mr. Twilly and the theater teacher, which the author set you up for the whole time. If the author wanted to make it interesting by keeping us guessing he could of supplied some supprises in the plot which was utterly pretdictable. I was dissapointed with this lame teen drama."
4,A great book for any high school student!,"Slave Day, although not a very complex and challenging read, has almost all the crucial issues of any high school. It not only describes just about any student personality imaginable, but it shows how all these different people interact with one another. When I finished reading the book, I couldn't get the ending out of my mind, which, I believe, is a major ingredient for a great book. Even if this book is an assigned read for a class, it's worth the time it takes to read. It reads up extremely quickly; so it's not very time consuming. But however long it takes you to read it, I would say that it's well worth it!"
4,"Good, but he's done better","Rob Thomas is like the Midas of teen lit. Every book Rob Thomas touches turns to gold. This is no exception. The plot and idea for the book is very diffrent and interesting, and the book keeps you guessing and interested. It's fast-paced, with many plot twists and great dialog, as usual for him.But, it isn't as good as his books like ""Rats Saw God"". It tries to be funny, but doesn't always succead, and some of the characters can be aggrivating. Those are the only draw backs, though. Still an awsome read."
4,interesting and fun,"Slave Day was the thrird book that I have read by Thomas, the first was Rats Saw God. I must say that the second two books could never compare to the first. Even still I really enjoyed this book. I absoultly loved the eight first person narritives, it helped with speeding up character devolopment. It also let in many sup-plots which are just as interesting as the main one. Another thing I liked was that the two books, Slave Day and Doing Time, both took place at the same high school during the same year. I would strongly suggest this book to any one who likes realistic ficton with a lot of teenage humor."
4,"This was a good, realistic book.","Upon reading this book, i have come to the conclusion that this is the first book i have ever read, that even remotly sounds like the things that go through my mind. I am a normal teenager, (I like to think) and most books I have read sound like the perfect characters that authors try to portray. But the kids in this book almost came to life for me, and they had real thoughts and emotions. They did real things that most kids would do. Because of this, I was able to relate to the characters in this book better that I have ever been able to with any other book I have read. I compared the situations that they were in to what I would do. I compared how they handled situations to how I would handle them. Also I got the best of all the worlds. I got the rich ""princess"" type, the human rights person, the preppy boy, the crappy teacher, all the different types of people were there, so it gave the reader a wide spread of everything."
4,Cute book!,"I read this book so fast, I forgot how I feel about it. lol. After reading a sample, I remembered what this book was about. Nothing stands out about this book (in a line up of the other A&J novels), but it was a good read (as are the rest of their books). I will say that this ending had a surprise twist!!! Not nearly as sad as the rest of their novels! Man, I love their work! After you finish this book, you'll want to volunteer at youth centers in your city. READ IT!"
4,Fairy tales,"No money more problems. And the rich think they have it bad. Check out Remy Morgan, orphaned and trying to make a dollar. The people that Remy rely on appear to be sick, which leads her from one bad place to the next. Possibly she's quick enough with the grip as Remy may have picked the wrong pocket to trick. Can it be has Remy found her real life prince?I doubted that two authors would be able to remain consistent. Nice flow."
4,Wow!!!,This book was a great read It was a little slow in the beginning but it took off after the second chapter and I couldn't put it down. The ending was great!! I would have given it 5 Stars but I needed a little more detail and you will know what I'm talking about once you read it!! You must read this.
4,Good Read,"This book kept my attention from the beginning to end. I started reading late one night and it was hard for me to put it down to get some sleep. However, I must say, I really wish we could have found out what drove Remy to do what she did in the end. Cease seemed like the perfect man."
5,Magnificent!!!!!!!!!,"What a wonderful read that was well worth my money. I love when a book just flows so beautifully. Ashley Jaquavis did a wonderful job writing this novel it was very hard for one to put down. It was very fast paced and enjoyable. I did not want to put it down and just when you think you know what the ending is going to be you are floored.This is a love story about Remy and Ceaser, Remy had a hard knock life and every time her life appears to get better a monkey wrench is thrown in somewhere. The funny thing is you don't really say poor Remy because some of the pain that happens to her she brings on her self. The author takes you through Remy's life by sharing her diary with you and what a powerful diary. I will have to entrust that any real avid AA reader will go out and buy this book. Well Well DONE!!!!!!!!I haven't had a book have me on a rollercoaster since I read The Great Pretender By Millenia Black."
3,disappointed with the way it ended,"I've read a lot of A&J books and all I can say is why do all of the main characters have to be killed off why is that. And also why do the drug kingpins in most of their stories start to get real stupid I just want to say A&J you need to start to let your books have a happy ending and stop letting the people in your books take a turn for the worst And also how did Remy and Jodie hook up and when and why would she want to.I know that you can paint urban fiction in a better light than what you're doing get a grip and start more positive writing also you can write an urban fiction book with twist and turns and positive energy I know you don't want to paint criminals in a positive light but there is corruption in all walks of life and not just in drug dealing corruption comes in all forms shapes and colors especially wall street, politicians not just drug dealers human trafficking and the list goes on lol"
5,Excellent Read!!!!!,It was my first time reading Ashley Jaquavis when I got it from the girl at work I must say that I was little hesitant about the book but it was excellent. It read this book in one day I was so into this book I couldn't even pay y husband any attention and had to cook a quick meal so that I could back to the book. They got me at the end though I never saw that coming. Now I have to find another book that they have written.
5,Street Classic,"I loved this book. My girl got me reading their first novel and after that I was hooked. But this one, they outdid themselves, I was feeling all the characters especially Khadafi. I haven't read anything this fire since Coldest Winter. Definately a classic. Although Its not better than Coldest, its the best thing since. The ending had me shocked. Good Job Ashley and Jaquavvis."
4,GOOD READ,"This was a good read, you want be disappointed, the ending took me by suprise, it kept you on the edge, its a page turner, I couldn't put it down."
5,CINDERELLA,REMY.. RAGS TO RICHES..BABY HAD NOTHING AND WITH THE BLINK OF A EYE SHE HAD SOMETHING..AN SHE HELD HIM DOWN BUT LOW-KEY SHE WAS FEELING HIS RIGHT HADN MAN.AND CEASE WAS FEELING HER.. BUT THEY HELD HIM DOWN UNTIL HE DIED AND CEASE TOOK CARE OF HER..
4,a really good read,This was the first ashley/jaquavis novel that I read. I love reading urban fiction and I heard about this duo team that was bangin' out books so I picked this up. This was really interesting from the first page til the last. I would recommend this to anyone who loves urban lit.
3,Read it in 6 hours!,The book was excelent. If your online now searching for something to read then BUY THIS BOOK! I don't recommend a book unless its a 10 on my scacle and this was definetly a 10. The story had a lot of twists and turns. If you think you can predict how this story ends then think again.
1,LiES!!,My item hasnt reached me yet. I ordered it on time so it can be in for my sister's bday and its still it TX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im 2 pissed. Never again!!!
3,Not so much of real diary!!!!,"I read this book in one day and was somewhat disappointed. Great story line but needed more details, for example, how did Jodi and Remy hook up? What Khadifi really alive? If you want something to read very qucikly then this is the book for you."
4,Paint by Numbers,I bought this for my niece and she loved it! She wanted to start doing paint by numbers and she loves fairies so this was perfect!
3,Great Show,The show is great but this DVD lacks menu and a proper intro. The good news for me is some unnecesary stuff in between the songs have been removed. Example is Yngwie introducing his wife Amber.I got this DVD yesterday from amazon.
5,Great Buy!,"I really like this feeder, it is built well & believe it will last a life time! The money you spend on socks will pay for this in no time."
1,Birds prefer the sock,"This feeder appeared to be a real upgrade from the sock that I'd first tried. The birds started to use the sock, so lets go for a pretty feeder---the birds wouldn't use it. I left the new feeder up for a couple of weeks with no sock competition thinking that they'd get the hang of it, but no. As soon as the sock went back up it was mobbed."
5,Finally on dvd!,"I've been looking for these to come to dvd for years. It's a fascinating and thrilling trilogy. The series starts with Blood Wedding, in which a filmed dance rehearsal draws the viewer into a compelling story. Carmen is a blend of reality and fantasy in which elements of the flamenco production spill over into the dancer's lives (or is it vice versa??). El Amor Brujo is a fully realized musical production, set entirely on a soundstage with lush colors, much like a 50s Hollywood musical. It's an interesting progression to consider and each of the films fantastic on their own terms."
5,Review of Flamenco Trilogy purchase,"I was very happy with my purchases from Amazon. I received the DVD's very quickly, and in good condition. Ricky sent me an email advising that he had posted the DVD""s. Overall I was happy with everything."
1,Eclipse series 6: Carlos Saura's Flamenco Trilogy. Maria Campano.,I have yet to receive this product. It was expected by 10/12/2012 but has not arrived by 24/12/2012.It is meant to be a Christmas present.
5,Excellent product - make thin hair look full and smooth,"No longer need 2 hands to blow dry your hair - one holding the round brush and the other the blow dryer. This is an all in one. Great product. I owned the previous Revlon like this (it came in black) but it broken (the brush part kept popping out). This new pink one is nicer, came with more gadgets and is made stronger. Love it!"
2,too loud for me,"I bought this item to replace my styling brush plus hair dryer. However, it is so loud that I cannot bear to use it. Aside from that it is okey."
3,works well but isn't durable,"I have thick long hair and I never used to blow it out because it was a hassle and cumbersome so I used to air dry. I'm really glad I got this brush as it made my hair smoother and gave me a more put together look. Unfortunately it stopped blowing hot hair after about 5 weeks of regular use. The amazon sellers return policy expired after 30 days. I haven't contacted Revlon yet but I hope they can send me a new one. I really like that it's convenient and that I only need to use one hand.I guess there is no warranty so I'm not sure if I should buy this again or go with another brand. From the reviews I've read though, they all seam to die relatively quickly. I'll probably get another one but if it won't last longer this time I'm switching to a different brand."
2,"A good hair dryer, not a styler","This is a powerful hair dryer, brush combo. It heats up well, and is extremely loud like many others have reviewed. The problem I had, was that it wouldn't do what I wanted it to. I have shoulder length hair with layers and I used products, but I couldn't get this hot air brush to curl my hair under or flipped out. After 30 min of running it through my hair, my hair just looked like I had blow dried it without any style. I used both attachments, but no luck. Oh, and the attachments popped off once or twice very easily when they shouldn't have. I think my hair is stubborn because it doesn't do well with a straight iron either, but I just might be buying cheap products. I wouldn't recommend this because it's so loud and doesn't seem to be much more than a hair dryer and a round brush."
3,Seems to work well but indeed very LOUD,"Well it's pretty easy to use. I had to use two hands just to roll it because it was kind of large for my hand. It dried my hair pretty quickly (fine hair, shorter than shoulder) but after I was done, my left ear had that slightly numb feeling I used to get after I'd been at a dance club all night. I might return it for that reason, even though it did the job pretty well. I can't afford to loose any more of my hearing. Those extra watts come with a price."
2,Revlon RV446 1200 Ion Ceramic Hot Air Kit,The handle is too fat and heavy. It dries your hair ok. Your hand and arm gets tried. You can not hold on the end to help hold it because it is to hot.
4,Great Product!,This is a very nice dryer styler. I only have one complant the end of the brush is hard to hold with out burning your hand/fingers. I was used to one that the end was a little knob like to hold on too and this one has a end its just not real easy to hold and therefore i burn my fingers. Im trying to figure a way not to do that tho. Other wise its great!! My daughter was visiting and now she wants one.
2,Too Hot,I have color treated hair and found that after using it for a while my hair started breaking.
1,A throw-away,"I have used Conair hot air brushes and liked them, but I couldn't find one with a 1"" bristled barrel for my growing but not yet long enough for a 1.25"" diameter barrel hair. I settled on this Revlon model because it has the features I want. After using it five times, I am looking for a replacement so I can throw it away. Although it does a good-enough job, I dislike it intensely because 1) the air flow is much too intense, 2) it is far too noisy, 3) low heat setting isn't hot enough but medium setting burns my scalp and ears, and 4) overall size is large and difficult to handle. It's no doubt fine for long, thick hair; mine is ear-length, thin and fine."
3,Not bad.,"gets a little hot...and air blows pretty hard on the ""high"" setting. Makes it hard to keep the hair around the brush."
4,Love everything but the lifespan,"This works great. I'm all thumbs when it comes to styling and this is perfect for me. I can simply brush and dry while I read my morning email, and my hair is full-bodied and shiny all day.That said, I'm getting my third because the plastic catch that holds the attachment (brush or air) fails. I like the bristles and heat/power settings on this particular model, so I've stuck with it. It seems to be about a year between replacements."
2,Not for me,"This was not for me. Handle too big to hold well and too powerful, makes hair fly. I prefer the Helen of Troy smaller one."
2,Not great for straight hair,"I wasn't very impressed with this hot air kit. My hair is long, straight and has layers and I found it close to impossible to get the brush to ""stay"" in my hair in order for it to style and dry. I had to hold the hair on the brush with my free hand which defeats the purpose of having an all-in-one dryer. I'm better off with a round brush and blowdryer."
5,Revlon Hair Styler,"Love this product. Received it in perfect condition and when it dies will order another one. I have owned several but after few years unfortunately, they die. Feel like I got my monies worth and would order again from this company."
2,did not last,"had this item 6 months, it begin to smell of burnt plastic really bad. we threw italway."
3,OK but not great,OK but not great. The death scene for the monster is could be better and they changed it roar for that scene also.
1,Snow Beast (1977) DVD,"Unfortunately , because its a DVD-R Format , I am unable to play it on my DVD players or on my computer. I wish I knew this before I purchased it."
1,No Instructions,"Ordered this to replace one i already had, arrived without the instructions touted in the advert. Much to my dismay i have been unable to get it to work."
4,A worth while read,"The book gives a good background history on the conflict in Sierra Leone, providing the reader with framework to understand the greater conflict. The story of the actual raid, while lacking in detail is well delivered and interesting enough for a military professional or someone interested in Sierra Leones recent history."
1,not exciting,This is a book long on historical backgrounds and logistical info. Very little that is colorful or revealing abt the culture of the British military or SAS.
2,Style of narration distressing,"Thea Devine's style of narration is getting harrowing and despite the steamy eroticism glossing up the pages between two impassioned characters - Elizabeth and Nicholas, one couldn't help feeling the plot is convoluted and jumbled up. Her abundant use of italics sabotaged the plot rather than enhanced it; Elizabeth as a widowed countess is forced to secure her wealth and subjugate to Micholas, one who is to claim his estate after the demise of her husband - with an arson and murder attempts - she finds out that it is the jewels of the Empress that somebody is after.The pearls are used as an instrument for their ...and through out the book, the sex gradually loses its captivation without any emotions. The mystery is appalling and Thea Devine rambles on only to find that the twist is much too predictible.SEDUCTIVE coming from a erotica writer as vintage as Thea Devine, comes out disappointing and not so devine after all."
4,Sexy and Stimulating,"I still like Sinful Secretss when it comes to SEXY scenes. The plot of this book is similar to Thea Devine's collection. The woman is estranged, and the man wants her with a twinge of suspense.Buy Sinful Secrets if you like it raw and hot."
3,Mew's best effort,"Having lived in Denmark for a long time now, I followed Mew's progression from unknown to relatively successful. Frengers is their best album, but the band really isn't my cup of tea. I like this release for it's somewhat harder edge, which I think suits them better than all that extra-atmospheric crap. Still, the sound is too layered for my liking and Bjerre's voice isn't powerful enough to allow the band to really kick it. Snow Brigade was a damn good single, though. Other Danish bands you may want to check out are: The Raveonettes, Nephew, Carpark North."
5,Sounds great,"This is as good as And the Glass Handed Kites album. Overall, it's lush and robust with delicacies such as ""Symmetry"" and ""Her Voice Is Beyond Her Years."" Once it gets going, ""SheSpider"" shapes up as one of the best tracks, along with ""Comforting Sounds."" But they're all comforting sounds, indeed."
5,great for blanching peas,Was looking for a pot to replace an old pasta cooker I had been using for years to blanch peas and beans before freezing. This is PERFECT!!!!!! Water quickly comes to a boil and the strainer makes easy work of blanching and cooling down the peas. Also the insert almost reaches the bottom of the pot ...so you can blanch 2-3 times more than in a conventional enameled alum. pan that I had been using. A MUST HAVE for anyone that is putting up peas or beans for the winter.
2,Dissapointed (by product not Abe's),"I have many Cuisinart products in my home that I've been very happy with but this was the first cookware (pot). I've only used it a few times and have noticed rust spots on the top rim of the pasta insert. I also noticed the lid rocks a bit and doesn't fit nicely.I called Cuisinart and they will only ship replacement product to U.S. address (I'm in Canada). Abe's had kindly agreed to accept the replacement product and then ship to me, however, I'd have to pay for shipping to and from Cuisinart (warranty doesn't cover this) and that's about the price of the pot. I probably won't buy Cuisnart stainless steel again...and am rethinking the future purchase of their electric stainless steel skillet....concerned it may rust, too."
2,"Nice pan, low quality construction","Loved this when I got it, but it cracked after a few months under NORMAL use. When I called about the warranty, I found out it doesn't guarantee replacement or pay shipping, which was going to be almost half the price of the product. Next time I'm going to pay a little more, go with a more reputable manufacturer."
2,Wanted it so bad!,"I had been wanting a 12 quart pot for a long time, and thought I had found a great one until I made Brunswick Stew, and it scorched. This pot is not heavy duty enough for thick soups, and stews in such large quantities. It's great for pasta, and steaming, but I already had pots for that purpose. I am greatly disappointed in this Cuisinart 4 piece 12 qt. pot."
1,Vendor Not Product,"I love Cuisinart, and planned to get this steamer, however, the price on this one is NOT A DEAL! You can go to Cuisinart and it will be the exact same price. Frankly, in a case like this, I would prefer to buy directly from Cuisinart then some third party vendor who makes it seems as though your getting a deal."
4,exelent buy,"needed another large pasta/soup pot, this to me was the best buy ,and the price was right.i was not dissapointed"
4,good value,"This is not the thickest of pots, but it is nice and works well. I actually get better pasta results now. I have expensive commercial pots and pans other than this one, and for the money, this is a great value."
4,Cuisinart 77-412 Chef's Classic Stainless Steel Pasta Pot,"I like this minus one small thing... it seems to take forever for the water to begin to boil. This is my only problem, otherwise it is a great product."
5,Pasta Away,"My sister,Kathy,is coming to visit me from New York City and she is a great pasta cook. This is why I was prompted to buy this wonderful Pasta Pot."
4,Grrrrrr,I chose the Cuisinart brand over others because I have some of their other products. This one is MADE IN CHINA. Grrrrrr.
5,Love this set,"Very heavy pasta/steamer set which is very good, I use it mostly to cook pasta and is fantastic, very convenient. I really like this set and I use it at least once a week."
4,"as i said somewhere else, some good and some not so good","the new software is much improved, and the labels really are stronger than the paper ones, which is what i wanted, but, really, the printing quality is sometimes just not what i expect - it looks fragile and uneven, as if it will flake off sooner or later. this happens less with larger fonts."
3,Not as described,"I own several DYMO labelers with mixed feelings about the quality. I ordered these labels expecting an 18ft length label. The product received shows actual label size is 3/4"" x 11.5ft.The product description states the label size as; ""Label Size - text - 3/4"" x 18ft."""
4,Rhino 5000 Labels,"For the purpose in which they were being used the labels worked well. However we were a little disappointed with the amount of labels on the roll. We went through (2) rolls rather quickly, other than that we were satisfied with the labels."
4,Mengele's village,"Documentary which shows that powerful monsters can own villages. Scary. Mengele escaped to live in ""peace"", while thousands suffered for his crimes. Unbearable, but still contemporary. Money (and fear!) can buy silence. See for yourself."
5,TRUE !!!!!!!!!!!!!,Did you know that Mengel injected Formaldahyde into women`s wombs at Aushwitz ! OUCH !!!!!
3,Nice proto-Generationals,"The Generationals may be my favorite new band discovery of the past couple of years, so I've been scrambling to gather everything they've done. Eames Era was an earlier band with some of the same key creative personnel. It's definitely ""earlier material"" but a lot of the brilliant Generationals signature elements are still in here.On its own terms, it's a pretty cool, fun indie power pop obscurity too."
1,Dullsville,"I've been digitizing our old LPs and just did Hot House Flowers.Mr. Marsalis was hot in 1984 and I bought this LP and was so disappointed. I gave it to my wife after two listenings. I doubt she played it more than a couple times too. If one word could describe the record, then I can only tell you that it plods. There's only one tune that has any life--I'm Confessin' (That I Love You). What more is there to say."
2,Don't bother,"Ok, while its obvious someone tried to create some sort of art (I guess you can call it that) the cards are way to blue (all cards are BLUE) - Color has a message and meaning in any Tarot but not in this one! The images are ...not images. Too celestial I guess for me. Not easy to even get a 'gut' feeling when I look at a card. Buy something else.If you want fun cards go for the dragon cards. If you want beautifull and easy go for the Golden and/or Gilded. There are so many other better Tarot out there"
4,Beautiful,"I do love the art. It is dreamy and lovely, but is not a deck that speaks to me. For those who know the myths of the planets and stars this would be a wonderful deck, as that is the theme."
4,Great intermediate deck,"Definitely not for a beginner, but a great deck if you already have some understanding of the tarot. I would buy it again for myself, but I'm quite attached to the deck I have now."
5,Love the combination of Astrology with Tarot,"I have the Spiral Tarot by the same author/artist and absolutley love the size and iconography. I bought the Celestrial to combine my two passions of astrolgoy and tarot, while I am still mastering this deck I find it extremely insightful and great connections."
4,My research led me to believe this is the right product,"When the time comes to lube the shutter on my beautiful, but aging Canon F1, I'll have this stuff handy to hopefully stop the shutter from sticking in cold weather. I assume a droplet on each of the rails will do."
5,These books are the bomb!,Harry Potter is the best fictional person in the world of reading! I've enjoyed reading these books and can't wait until the next ones! These are must read books and they should make them into movies!
5,Fantastic!,These books transport readers of all ages to a world of magic and delight. Perfect for any child or adult who grew up differently. Ms. Rowling has written a series of books that enchant and tickle the human soul. I can hardly wait to get the next four in the series!
4,Binding will not hold up to hard use,"My two children have already worn out a set of hardback Harry Potter books, so I don't know why I thought a paperback set would survive any better. Maybe I thought since they had read the others at least three times each that this set wouldn't get the same wear. I was wrong. My children (and husband) keep reading these books over and over. And the books are starting to fall apart. When they wear this set out, I'll get the best hardback set I can find! If your set won't get this kind of wear, it is a fine set."
4,A good read,"I just finished The Sorcerers Stone, and really enjoyed it. I am an adult that reads constantly, and I never read children's literature for my own enjoyment. I bought the book to read aloud to my 8 yr.old daughter, but after she went to bed I read more and more on my own. Finally I chucked the whole idea of reading aloud so I could curl up with it on my own to read!"
5,WOW!,"I am a college student at Yale University, and I daresay I am glad that Ms. Rowling has only finsihed the first three HP books, or my grades would be toast. These books are so enchanting that after reading the first page of The Sorcerer's Stone, you will be able to think of nothing else until you have finished all three works. Young Harry, Ron, Herimione, Hagrid, Malfoy, Dumbledore and the rest of the Hogwarts gang are the first team in a long time (indeed, perhaps ever) that can truly give Frodo, Sam, and Gandalf a challenge for the crown of the fantasy kingdom"
5,Harry prtter,"I love the Harry Potter books, but i just wish J.K. Rowling would put out the fifth one so i can read it too. Who cares if the movies coming out this year I WANT THAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Sorry JK Rowling only writes one per year,I'd say I am really in love with Harry and his wonderful friends Hermione and Ron and well...I'm already 26. They can really take you to a magical world and get you rid of the usual boring tasks of daily life and work. This one I'll surely read to my children when I'll have them.
5,Harry Potter is one of the best sets of books ever,"I read all 4 books in 4 1/2 days. Granted I did nothing all day, but read. It was completely worth it, though. Harry Potter is incredibly well-written and well-organized. J.K. Rowling in a genius! I can't wait for 5 to come out! It's perfect for all ages, everyone will love Harry Potter. It keeps you interested at every word and you can't wait to pick up the next book once you've finished one. I absolutely adored all 4 books!"
5,this author is outstanding and makes you at home at Hogwarts,"after reading this series of books, i knew absolutely everything about the characters and scenery from the great descriptions. when i read that Harry is walking somewhere, i can picture him walking even though it is not meanchoned. also, when it says, for example, we went to our dormitory, i know exactly what it looks like and can picture a map of the school. Harry Potter books are adventures you witll never forget!!!"
2,New York Vertical New York Vertical,Was not expecting this to be a minature version of the original full size I was replacing.Otherwise I would give it a five rating.
3,"Handy, but it's too small.",This book may be appropriate as a guide of skyscrapers in NYC. But I feel a little frustration when I look as a photo catalogue.
5,good multi-functional product,"I have mainly used it as a storage device so far. It works well. I tried the presenter function on my mac (powerbook G4), and it worked. Just ignore the automatic keyboard set-up message when you plug it in."
5,Ideal for women and men,"My wife (then girlfriend) introduced me to this title while it was still a working-copy being distributed around BYU campus. I count this book as a key contributor to the success of my marriage to a highly ambitious, intelligent, and spiritual woman. I recommend it. It will change for the better your approach to the male-female relationship."
5,Best Dog Shampoo Ever - Even I use it!,"When I could no longer buy this shampoo and the matching conditioner in pet stores, I was grateful to find it on the Internet. This is a gentle shampoo for any dog and helps white hair look white. I have used this on all of my dogs with long hair - such as my current two Shih Tzus. A secret is that this is a great shampoo for me. I have a type of hair that is fine and gets matted. This shampoo works well on my own hair in a pinch - giving it softness and body. It's true!"
5,name of the song where the bus breaks down,"the song is called ""do wa ditty"" by Zapp and Roger (great synth funk band of the 80s who did the song ""I wanna be your man"") hope that was helpful!"
5,This movie and cd is AWESOME!,Selena is the BEST movie of all time! I will forever and always love this movie and cd
4,My favorite performer of all-time,"The CD that accompanies the acclaimed film dedicated to slain Tejano singer Selena (many know she's my favorite all-time performer, and my first inspiration for singing) is a great tribute. It incorporates many rare tracks and shows us why Selena was one of the world's best."
5,"A voice so golden, it is timeless","Selena's voice has so much feeling and movement to it and she doesn't even try. SHe has the most beautiful natural talent I have ever heard. This album shows all Selena was and all she could have been. With songs like ""Where did the feeling go?"" it shows her ability to sing the ballads and ""Is it the beat?"" shows that she can sing the faster dance songs as well. YOu have to own this album because Selene is the greatest singer of all time and its a shame that it took a tragedy, her death, for everyone to realize how special she was. I became a fan when the movie ""Selena"" came out. I had owned her album ""Dreaming of you"", but I hadn't listened to it much, then I saw this movie and she is one of my favorite singers now. I guess its better to be a fan late than never at all. Even though she is not with us anymore her music will last for many lifetimes; for her voice is timeless."
3,Could Have Been Done Better,"It needs a bit more balance. This is Selena for English speakers, which I am one but most of her best stuff was in Spanish. Not much of the Latin sound in most of her English songs. Here they run through her Spanish hits in a quick live medley. Being the soundtrack of a movie about a woman and family that was all about music this probably should have been a double album. Lots of material they could have selected. I do like that it includes 'We Belong Together' and the Disco Medley, as in the movie Selena was a little girl telling her Dad she wants to sing Linda Ronstadt. During the credits we hear her singing in English 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow', which I thought was nice. That's not on this album. All that said though it is still good music and enjoyable to listen to."
4,Does anyone know this song?,Hey does anyone know the name and who sings the song that was playing when Selena and Chris were on the bus and they were dancing and they kissed and got caught? It's sort of like a pop song?
4,Good Book Summarizing All Aspects of Space Flight To Date,"This well written book about the space age provides an excellent summary of the space program to date and people and leaders who made it happen. About half of the book covers the early space pioneers, like Von Braun, Oberth, Goddard and Tsoilkovsky and the early attempts to build a working rocket. The second half covers the early space program, the Apollo missions to the Moon, and eventually moves into the modern era. There are also plenty of chapters about the Russian space program and various robotic explorations of the planets.While most of the information presented in this book can be found in greater detail in other books, this book would be a nice addition to any collection of space flight or for the novice space flight reader who wants to learn a great deal about the space program."
1,Different color/Cheap Wood,"This tray is not the honey color as shown in the picture, it is light pine. The tray is very light which makes the wood feel and look cheap. Not right for this price."
2,Not Quality Construction,"I ordered this product/tray to give as a gift at Christmas and was disappointed with the quality of the product. As others mentioned, the bottom is very thin and just placed into the sides, not glued as the dove-tailed construction implies. If you need to use this tray to serve, as a tray to hold for carrying, it wouldn't hold up. Order only if you intend to use this tray for display. I had to return it which was an easy process but cost me time and money in the end."
2,Not what you expect from Villeroy & Boch,Made from poor quality material and craftmanship. The bottom of the tray is so thin it vibrates and is noisy. It's not at all a quality product one would expect from Villeroy & Boch.
4,A great review of Basic Industrial Hygiene,"This book was a great reference for Basic Industrial Hygiene information. It was very easy to understand and to find information. If you are looking for a book, which will help you learn the concepts of Industrial Hygiene or as a good basic reference guide you have found your book."
1,Wish it could be less than one star.....,"Do you remember this line.....""It depends on what your definition of IS, is."" This movie is nothing but a pack of lies. It is true, it seems that the Feds produced this movie to try to cover their you know what. Don't waste your money, buy Waco, Rules of Engagement."
5,"Hilarious, intriguing, and inspirational","What a wonderful book! Parts had me chuckling out loud, parts had me glued to the pages, and other parts made me want to become a better person myself. Anyone who has worked in a fine dining establishment or eaten in one should read this book."
5,Restaurant business inside out !,"Are you a restaurant owner, a waiter or a customer ? Read this book and learn from a professional. This is a must know for everybody. It really is worth your time and money ! After 25 years in this business I can only tell you one thing : JOHN GALLOWAY is right on the money ! Bravo !"
5,fine dining madness,Great book for anyone who has interested in Fine Dining. A must read for the young on how to act in a real Fine Dining restaurant. Thanks to John on a well written book.
3,Enlightening but not as entertaining as I had hoped...,"I purchased this book based on the recommendations I read here. I have to say I was disappointed with this book. Considering how everyone here raved about it, I thought it was going to be this fantastic book. It just did not live up to the reviews. There were some funny parts and the first couple of chapters with the ""rules"" were enlightening, but it wasn't worthy of 5 or even 4 stars, in my opinion."
5,An Absolute Laugh Riot That Helps To Rebuild New Orleans,"I absolutely love this book. It's funny and conciseoffering a detailed look at the resturant business.Very original too. Galloway is not politicallycorrect, but his humor makes the book well worthit. Also, I highly admire Galloway for donatingALL of his 2005 royalties to Hurricane Katrinarelief efforts.His next project is The Tribute Flight, an eventthat honors United States military personnel kiiledin Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11/01. I look forto this event, and subsequent book."
3,"Good info, lame effort","Durso writes like he was the only person who knew DiMaggio. He disgraces colleagues and friends in the attempt to make his relationship with DiMaggio look better. While the info within this book was good, it does not do justice to the life of the American icon, Joseph Paul DiMaggio. While this book is a decent effort, Richard Ben Cramer's ""Joe DiMaggio: A Hero's Life"" looks to be the better read. The one part I did enjoy was the information on DiMaggio's lawyer Morris Engelberg and his law office's campus HQ in Hollywood, FL where Yankee Clipper Enterprises is run. Decent book overall, but too much reptitiveness and not enough new info."
3,Not following with the DL series,"You should have to have read all the DL books in order to write for them. I did not even realize this story was about Tanis's mother until I read all the other reviews because in one of the prelude books (Tanis The Shadow Years, I think) he goes back in time and meets his mother and it is nothing like this. Anyways my other complaint is that his mother throughout the entire book wants to be rescued and hates the people who captured her then in the last 20 pages all the sudden she hates her husband and loves Brand. It was a bit of a stretch for me."
2,poetry??,"First off I would like to say that this book does have a good story line, that is if you can understand it. The writings that this author (Berberick) uses is not easy to follow for she uses a poetic type of wording that is not typical to the dragonlance series. When I try to read the words to creat that visual in my head of the story it just scrambles it form the reverse writing that the author uses. It tends to distract you from the real story and leave you in the fog where every thing is blurred. If you are a dragonlance fan then you will read this, If not then pass on this one for it does not work for me to be a real dragonlance book."
3,Nice Set,"I really like this set, and do get a lot of use out of them, but the grips keep slipping off randomly. with those were built at a more professional grade."
4,man funkadelic is the greatest rock band ever,"man this was ruth's second lp before she fell off the music scene and just vanished off the face of the planet anyway she had some help from george clinton and the o.g. funkadelics they really rock out on here on don't you wish you had man eddie hazxel just took his listeners to that place man he was so underrated and surburban family lament, gimme me shelter man if you like old psychedelic rock and wanted to hear want janis joplin would have sounded like if she ventured to the ghetto get this."
1,Not nice,"I fell in the pond once, and it really wasn't very nice, and this book brought back horrible memories for me, especially with its overly descriptive passages on pondweed and quacking ducks. I was too traumatised to carry on reading. Not a book for sensitive people."
4,A weeker version of Waiting,"In the PondThis is another fascinating Ha Jin book. If you have already read Waiting and liked it, you will like this one too, except it is not as lyrical in its style. Also the main character is certainly not spineless as in Waiting, so you tend to root for him.As in Waiting, In the Pond is so full of the almost comical behavior of the small time communist leaders in Cultural Revolution China. The brain washed society come across so natural and almost innocent.In contrast to Waiting, In the Pond, is faster paced and much more full of action. Perhaps the reduced amount of reflection and the faster pace is what made the language less captivating than Waiting.Enjoy!"
5,Read This Book,"Normally I wouldn't take the time to do something like this, but this is one of the best books I've ever read. When I read, I tend to be aware of style--that an author is trying to convey something in a certain way. I was swept away by this book. In the book, the main character thinks about what it means to produce a masterpiece; he thinks it means to become one with the artistic piece. ""In the Pond"" must be a masterpiece. The story is so alive. You live the book as you read it. You feel as if you're there. If you'd like to get outside of yourself completely for awhile, this is the book for you."
2,Not that comfy,I love dearfoams but these do not stay on my feet and the inside keeps shedding. I keep going back to my old worn out ones rather than the new ones.
2,Tacky...,"I took a chance on this slipper because of the positive reviews but the leopard/cheetah pattern is really, really tacky in person and the ""cushioning"", to me, feels absolutely weird. I returned them because the size I got was too small but I would have been really unhappy to keep them anyway for the above reasons."
4,They looked nice but!,"The slippers looked real nice, but when my roommate tried them on they were too narrow and not quit the ones she wanted... So I had to return them."
1,Slipper does not fulfill looks,"Although the picture looked great, I found that this product was inferior. I wear a size 7 1/2 so I ordered an 8 as suggested. This was the correct length, but the slippers fell off although I have a medium width foot. In addition, the soles were very thin and offered no support. I returned the product for credit."
1,DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My wife hates it! The entire contruction is poorly made. The stiches penetrate throgh the inside wich is very unconfortable. Should have gone to the mall and looked for a nice one, bad Xmas present!"
5,work stand bar bell holder,THE STAND IS JUST PERFECT FOR MY BEDROOM WORKOUT AREA. IT CERTAINLY TAKES UP LESS SPACE AND IS MORE CONVIENENT TO USE!!
3,Great Product - Horrible Instructions & Bolts,"I wrote a review a few days ago but Amazon did not post it for some reason. This seems to be a great product but the instruction manuel as others have stated is HORRIBLE. It's very complicated and hard to follow. They need to hire someone else to rewrite the manuel. Also, the Hex Screws that they give you are HORRIBLE. After a week I've still not been able to get this thing put together so that it does not wobble. Why would anyone choose to use HEX Screws on a piece of solid equipment like this. I've been unable to tighten the screws all the way and have hurt my hand several times trying to do so. I would appreciate it if Nautilus would send me regular screws to replace these so that I can put my stand together and use it."
2,"Opinionated, with no proof or examples","If you are looking for a book that shows the history and development of hypnosis this book will prove to be frustrating and boring. The author informs us at length of how erroneous the thinking has been about hypnisis throughout the history of the civilized world. But there are no case studies, no facts, no scientific data in this book. If you are looking to be informed about hypnosis through facts and not opinions this is not the book for you. I suspect that the author has spent a lot of time in lecturing and giving opinions without ever being challenged."
5,"The BEST book on Hypnosis, bar none.",I learned more about Hypnosis from this book than any other that I have read. A completely different approach than most.
2,"Interesting, but lacking","Some of the book is enjoyable and insightful. However, much of it seems to merely argue semantics. Makes some good points, but is mostly lacking in substance."
2,"""Textbook Binding"" is rather poor",After buying a book for about $80 I expect to get value for my money. I was extremely disappointed to note that just one week after using the textbook (and solving exactly one homework assignment of 4 problems) the pages began to come out. I have seen other friends who bought the book have a similar problem. The contents of the book deserve 4 stars. But the lousy binding pulls down its rating to 2 stars.
3,low quality paper,"For a $90+ book the quality of paper is low and binding very bad. On the very day I got the book from Amazon, I had papers coming out unstuck. The paper used is not archival quality, typically expected for such high priced books. I am very disappointed. I have no doubts the text material is great and will be valid for a long time but I am sure the paper will not last even a few months."
1,What the Hell. Weird movie type game,Save your money. This game is just a lot of videos which confuse you and take you nowhere. I would bet someone on drugs might like this game
1,do not buy this - you will waste your money,"The amazon web site indicates this will work with newer versions of Win but it does NOT work with Win 7 - which is all there is now a days. Also, when we looked at it on our OLD computer using win 2000, it is terribly basic and not very interesting - and won't teach much to your little one. Save your money, buy something else, buy something more modern and challenging."
2,Great for Dad - but not large enough,"This bag is great for a short trip and looks masculine enough for Dad, but now that our daughter is 4 months old there is just not enough room for everything.There is only one main compartment to the bag, so there is no good way to keep things organized and you have to dig through the entire bag to find what you want. Not enough room for our small 3-bottle soft cooler. Just not big enough, although it's big on the outside."
3,NEEDS MORE ROOM FOR BOTTLES,I purchased this bag because I wanted to downsize my diaper bag. Overall it is not bad. I have not had a problem with it wearing out. The biggest problem I have is it's lack of space for bottles. It only has one pouch which does not fit all bottles. I do like the side zipper for easy access. Not the best buy for the money.
2,Not worth the $$,"I bought this diaper bag because it is gender neutral so that my husband and I could both use it on outings. Well, he didn't mind carrying it but because I am 5'4"" and petite and he is 5'11"" and muscular there is no way that we could both use it as a backpack without adjusting the straps each time. That can be a pain. Also, the inside is totally black which means that it's easy to lose things in there. There are not enough pockets to really organize anything so a majority of the time it is a mess. The drawstring doesn't close all of the way (annoying) and the fabric faded after only a few washes. If you really want a backpack I would suggest one that zips instead. In the end I Ebayed this backpack and just went with a regular satchel type bag that is trendy with a light interior and a zipper. It's a lot more my style and didn't cost me nearly as much."
1,frustrated,"I have had this bag for 4 months and became so frustrated with it that I finally returned it to Eddie Bauer. The flap never stayed fastened no matter how much or how little I had in it, and so I had to rely on the elastic cord around the top to contain the bags contends. However before long the seam around the cord fraid and I was left with a permanently open bag. All in all it was an awkward size and shape and most frustrating bag."
2,Just Buy A Regular Backpack,"This thing isn't worth the trouble.The flap doesn't stay closed, which I find REALLY annoying. It's not especially nifty or well-organized. For the money, a nice sturdy, regular backpack with lots of pockets would have done the job better."
2,Not So Great,"I registered for the bag because my husband really liked the look and the color. We used it everday and not even 3 months later, the zipper broke. We were constantly looking for our stuff because it would fall all the way to the bottom. I like to grab out of the bag without having to dig for our things. I wouldn't recommend this bag because it's not very convenient for the on the go parent."
3,If only the flap would stay closed,"I registered for this because I thought it was much cooler looking than the others, and thought my husband would be more willing to carry it. It looks great and holds a lot of stuff, but doesn't stay closed the way it should. When the pack is full, the flap doesn't stay velcro'd down, and I have many times found myself walking around with the pack hanging wide open behind my back. As soon as my daughter was big enough to sit up, she was going through the pack, pulling stuff out; I don't think that would have been as much of a problem with a zipped bag. Also it would be helpful if the inside were divided into more pockets because stuff tends to get very disorganized. There is a nice net pocket on the outside for drinks but only the skinniest bottles and cups fit into it; it needs to be enlarged."
1,fell apart,"i bought this bag to use as a diaper bag. in less than a month the straps broke, after returning it for a new one the same thing happened to the new one. the design is great! i love the set up of it. it is just made very badly."
3,Not enough room for bottles,"I purchased this because I liked how it looked. I liked the side zipper for easy access to items in the bag. However, I think it lacks enough room for bottles. I used it to downsize my diaper bag when I just had my toddler and although it seemed OK, I could not imagine using it for an infant. There is only 1 compartment for bottles and it is small and does not accommodate all types. I used it for several months and had no problem with the quality, but stopped using it with the birth of my second daughter because it lacked functionality. Overall, I am not impressed with the Eddie Bauer line."
3,Be Careful When Purchasing the bag,"I bought this bag 2 1/2 months ago and the nylon tore within 1 month. Toys R Us would not accept the return so I called the Manufacturer (Baby Boom - Can get number from Toys R Us). I was instructed that the bag has a 1 year warranty and to mail it back and they will send me a replacment. I received the replacement within 2 weeks and it is a MUCH better bag. The nylon area is smaller and the fabric is thicker (don't think it will tear as easy) and the pockets seem to be better padded. I think this bag will definitely hold up better. If not, I will again return it and then exchange it at the store for a different bag. By the looks of the new bag though, I think it will last. We will see!"
1,Nylon rips!,Not durable. I don't recommend this bag for anyone. I was excited when I received this bag as a shower gift but we only used it for a few months and the nylon began to rip. It is now a useless bag because the rip has expanded and there's a large tear across the front and side. It seems to be very poorly made and attempting to get a new one has been very difficult and frustrating as well.
2,Not the best,I got this bag as a shower gift and wish I would have returned it. If you have too much in the bag you can't get the changing pad in and out very well and the top never stays closed.For the money....look for something else.
2,My second choice when planning to be out and about,"We got this diaper bag because we wanted one that my husband would feel comfortable carrying. That is one of the few purposes we have found that it serves. I can fit alot of stuff in it, but then can't find it when I need it. It is deep but not very wide and the dark color makes it difficult to see down into the bag. I do like that it is a backpack, much easier to carry than the other bags we have."
1,Better Bags are out there!,"It doesn't open enough, and you're always feeling around for things. It comes with a flimsy at best changing pad that ripped when I opened it up the first time. (From the Velcro). I received it for my shower, and ended up going out a just getting a regular backpack for half the price - of course without the name. It has 2 large compartments and one small in the front. Much better, trust me!"
2,Not as happy with this bag as I thought I would be,I registered for this bag because it was more masculine than other bags I've seen. At first I liked the bag. It seemed to have adequate space for what I needed at the time. When my son was 4 months old I had to stop breastfeeding & I started formula feeding. The bag is not big enough for bottles & formula. I also agree with some of the other reviewers about how difficult it can be to get stuff out of it. It seems like I always have to remove more stuff than necessary to get to what I need.
2,Nice to have hands free but big disapointment,The backpack style is easy to carry but there is lots of room for improvement in this bag. There is a lack of compartments and it doesn't zip all the way down for easy access. I find myself searching in the black hole or inside of this bag for everything. No organization comes with this bag.
2,There are better bags,I bought this back pack bag and the regular Eddie Bauer diaper bag together. This bag ripped after using it for just 3 months. It's not easy to organize your items within the bag either. The regular bag held up better.
2,"If you have a choice, pick the Maxi Diaper Bag!","I was so excited to find a diaper bag my husband and both could carry! I want to the store before my daughter was born and purchased this bag, I wish I would have bought the other Eddie Bauer Bag, Maxi Diaper Bag. This backpack might look really great but the room stinks. I would go to the restroom and change my daughter and I would have to unload the bag to get the changing pad out and the diapers while trying to keep her on the changing table. Needless to say, I have now purchased the Maxi Bag and have spent 70.00 figuring this problem out! I wish I would have taken the reviews to heart! People were telling the truth!"
2,Not for me...,"Thought this backpack was nice at first but after time with it, it just doesn't work for me. The top just has a pull string closure on it so things can fall out of it easily if bending down. I'd rather work with a zipper so I knew nothing would fall out.Also, it seems too bulky & heavy even before you put anything in it. I think the rounded shape of it makes it feel bulkier than if it was a flat backpack. I just use a regular backpack that has separate compartments cuz this one does nothing for me..."
3,Has it's good and bad features. . .,"This bag has its good points, but I ultimately went with something else instead. I liked it's durability (it held up very well), the backpack style and it's casual, gender-neutral appearance. I also appreciated the side zipper for easy access, the exterior pockets and the drawstring closure with the flap on top- again very easy access. There were some fatal (for me) flaws, though: mainly, that when carried on just one side, the bag CONSTANTLY slips off the shoulder. This was extremely irritating. Also, when packed full the back is very bulky, rounded and unwieldy. (Great for bonking the baby on the head when the bag slips off your shoulder for the umpteenth time). Finally, the dark colored interior makes it difficult to see what's inside the bag and find what you're looking for. This bag could work well for some, but it wasn't the bag for me."
2,Nylon rips,I bought this backpack about 4 weeks ago and am disappointed in it. The nylon around the edging of the diaper pad started fraying and ripped and I just noticed that the nylon on the outer top edge is also coming off of the backpack. It has a lot of room and I like the style but it isnt very durable.
2,Irritating,"I would have given it one star except that it looks pretty cool and it is of decent construction.Reasons it irritates me:1) For a medium sized bag, it somehow manages to hold very little. The changing pad that comes with it is standard sized yet it takes up about 1/3 of the bag's interior.2) If you stuff it too full, the bag becomes unbalanced, and is therefore uncomfortable to carry on your shoulders. (One extra outfit, 4 diapers, a travel sized pack of wipes, two bottles, the aforementioned changing pad, and a 16 oz thermos constitutes ""too full."")3) The interior is solid black, so everything seems to get swallowed up in there.4) There are too many loops and strings that serve no practical purpose. They snag and get caught on my stroller's basket, my jewelry, my wrist when I reach into the bag, and even my foot once.I'll sell it to you cheap if you still want to buy it!"
2,Not so Great,"This bag is difficult to get in and get things out of. If it is full, it does not close. If you really want an Eddie Bauer bag, go to the Eddie Bauer store and purchase one there. The diaper bags sold in their stores are different and MUCH better...stronger, easy to use and they hold a lot. It is a bit more expensive though, but well worth the price."
3,didn't like as well as I thought I would,"We have a 20 month old daughter and we received this at our baby shower. The clasp that tightens the bag closed broke in approx. 9 months. This was with everyday use so we replaced it with the identical bag thinking the clasp broke as a fluke. It broke on the new one sooner. Without the clasp the bag hangs open and items fall out. My husband pushed for this bag when we registered since it has a great unisex look and is lacking any of those tacky pastel baby prints so many bags have. After we realized how poorly the clasp held up and thought about how frustrating it was that everything always fell to the bottom of the bag due to the deep design, we purchased a smaller Eddie Bauer bag that closes with a zipper and we're very happy with it."
1,Not satisfied !!!!!!,"I thought the back pack would be the smart way to go but boy was i wrong. I feel that this back pack is to bulky. To much padded - which is unnecessary since it was holding diapers, extra clothes etc. You can only carry it as a back pack. If you are in the mall you cant even hang it over your stroller. Maybe they should add an additional strap so that you can hang it over the stroller or over your shoulder. I used this for about 3 months then went out a purchased a regular diaper bag.."
2,too small,It is a great looking backpack and works if you only need to go somewhere for a short period of time. It doesn't hold very much and the top doesn't close like you think it should.
1,Dissapointed,"I was qute excited when I first discovered this bag. I really like Eddie Bauer products and assumed this one would hold up to the same standard. After using it for a few months (untill my son was about 4 months old), I found I was frustrated each time I used the bag. It is too small, the flap does not close when the bag is full, and due to it's size the bag does not sit well on my or my husbands back (and we're small people, I have no idea how anyone over 5'5"" can use the bag at all.)In the end the bag cost us twice as much because we had to stop using it and replace it with one that we could use comfortably for the rest if the time our son is in diapers."
1,This diaper bag is good for using as a bookbag,Not enough room to carry everything that you need for the baby. It does not have enough compartments. You are better off using this bag has a bookbag and taking it to class.
3,Any bag would do,I use it... but it's nothing that exciting it's a bag!! It was a gift so I kept it... but I should have returned it b/c it's just like any bookbag!
1,Nylon Ripped...Twice,"I originally loved this bag, and found it great for day trips with my newborn son. I had it for a short time and it ripped along the top where the bag closed. I returned it and got the same one (a big mistake) and 2 months later it ripped again!!!!! This time I can't return it to the store and have to try and contact the manufacturer. I'm VERY DISSAPOINTED!"
3,Beware falling bags,"We got the backpack because of the name (quality) and it has been very durable. We like the backpack style but...I NEVER carry any backpack on both shoulders. With this one, the straps are too small to do so. And when I carry it on one shoulder, it ALWAYS slips off every other minute, usually hitting my daughter in the head when she was in the carrier. I love the size, but there are not enough pockets to keep everything separated so it all gets jumbled together and hard to find. Do not plan on using the insulated bottle pocket for bottles. They don't fit.I kinda like it...I just don't want to HAVE to use it for child #2 - mostly because of the strap slippage issues."
2,Needs alot of improvement,"I thought this would be a great diaper bag since it was a backpack and would not get in the way when I was carrying my baby, but I was wrong. It is hard to get on and off if you have it packed. Packed is a change of clothes, diapers, the changing pad (which is not very good), wipes, and diaper cream. You have to unpack everything to get one thing out and little things get lost in it. I've only use it for a total of 4 weeks and the nylon around the opening is starting to come apart. I"
1,Mom to 1,My husband really likes this bag but I hate it! I have to feel around for stuff as it doesn't open enough. It constantly falls off my shoulders and I can't carry it and my daughter at the same time. I didn't have the problem with the drawstring but sippy cups do not fit in it well at all!
2,Keep on looking,"This bag was great at first because of the unisex style. Once you start to use it, you realize you should have kept on shopping around. The bag is big enough to store a lot of stuff but the top doesn't close very well or at all. And it is SO difficult to find things that you need beause the top doesn't open wide enough. It is too hard to deal with when you have a crying baby in your arms."
2,Just a backpack,This is just a backpack with a changing pad (and not a great backpack at that!) The drawstring doesn't stay closed (mine finally broke) and the flap doesn't stay closed especially if full. The backpack is a good idea especially when carrying an infant carrier and whatever else you have. Just look for another one.
2,A history of silver,"This short work covers the evolution of silver (mainly table) items, from the 17th through the 19th centuries. The book has 90 pictures (only 32 in color) of highly ornate silver items, and shows examples of some makers' marks. While this book will be of interest to anyone wondering about the history of silver, it definitely has little to say to anyone who is truly interested in the art of collecting silver. I do not recommend this book."
1,not a source of literary quotes,"I did not find this book useful. I was looking for a source of literary assistance. I wanted to find a special quote, bible passage or literary reference that would make my niece's bat mitzvah ceremony special. This book, however, contains only greeting card style poems which did not suit my purpose."
3,"not soothing, no lullabies","The company that put this CD together is either not familiar with classical music or what soothes a baby to sleep or both. While the CD is a great collection of classical music, it did not work for my toddler for 2 reasons:1. The volume fluctuates throughout each piece. Some parts are so soft that if your child is not used to a quiet room, they will not fall asleep (my toddler would start singing to herself), and then other parts are so loud that it will wake a drowsy child up.2. Not all classical music is slow and soothing. There are many energetic pieces on this CD that are not suitable for lulling a child to sleep. In my case, my toddler would start tapping her feet or hands to some of the pieces.Don't pay attention to the music sampler, it only portrays the slowest parts to each piece, and hides the fact that many pieces speed up and get louder as they progress."
2,Sound level is not consistent,This would be a great CD if the sound level was consistent. The first song is really soft so I would have the volume turned up so it can be heard but the other songs are louder so I have to turn it down or risk waking the baby. I have only listened to this CD twice because of the inconsistent volume we do not play this CD.
4,Good mix,"When I found this album, I was looking for another that I had used as a daycare teacher several years ago. This album has many of the songs I was looking for including Clare de Lune. In general I like that it has a nice selection of classical music that I can introduce to my children and use it for calming/sleeping purposes. During one visit with the grandparents, my husband put this album on & both Granddad & baby were asleep in minutes!I was amused to read some of the other reviews that bashed the volume changes between songs. To me this is an antiquated complaint. To fix the problem upload the album to your MP3 playing program (iTunes, etc.) assuming you bought the CD & didn't already download it in MP3 format, then arrange the songs so that the louder ones are eliminated or at the end. Finally, put the album onto your MP3 player or burn a new CD without the songs that cause problems..."
3,The CD's title is misleading,"This is a nice collection of classical music, but I don't find it to be particularly soothing. It certainly does not come close to deserving to be called the most soothing lullabies of the universe. You get the squelchy sound of violins and violas, and the volume changes between loud and soft from one track to another, and within the same song. There are s is not something I would want to go to sleep to. I guess I was hoping more of the gentle sound of the harp. A better choice would be some of the harp music by Carol J. Spears."
5,For My Brandnew Grandbabies,I finally found a way to get my girls to listen to classical music.They tell me it does calm the babies but I personally think it calms the Moms and they are learning to appreciate another type of music.
2,World's largest compact travel dryer,"It works OK, but it is definitely NOT a compact travel model. This is one of the few situations where I wish I had dragged myself to a store. If I had seen how big this beast is, I never would have bought it."
3,Wish it was more compact,"It seems like a decent hair dryer. I got it for use outside the U.S. and am looking forward to trying out that feature. Even though the dryer folds up, it is still rather bulky for travel and not really compact as advertised. If I had to do over, I would probably order a smaller unit."
1,Not a baby trader!,"I read this book to myself prior tho reading it to my daughter and desided to remove the book form the house! In the story a couple is blessed with twelve tiny ""rainbabies"" but then after the couple (and you as the reader) fall in love with the babies; the ""rain princess"" comes and takes all twelve babies and gives the couple a new ""human"" child to keep. I fell that the story could lead a child to believe that he/she could at any given time be ""traded"" for a different one. This is not a good message to convey to a child!"
3,"More than $10 for shipping. ""ebay"" game?",Just like some ebay items. The price tag is extremely low with a rediculous high shipping fee. Buyer beware!
4,It's a bit too wide.,"This thing works well. The only problem with it was that it was too wide at the USB joint, so that if you have two adjacent ports, you will not be able to use the other one. That said, I'm satisfied with the working quality of this reader."
3,Work well... but is very wide,This thing works well. The only problem with it was that it was too wide at the USB joint.
4,Does exactly what it says it does,"I chose this reader pretty much at random, while I was buying a few 2GB SD cards, but I'm glad I did. It's been completely reliable for transferring data between cameras, MP3 players, and Windows, Linux, and Mac computers. It's a little wider than my other key, but nice and flat so it fits pockets well.The only things I wish were different about it are:1. It would be nice if the USB-side cap stored on the opposite side while in use. It's easy to misplace the cap.2. The plastic case is rather smooth, and would benefit from some texturing to make it easier to grip when removing it (particularly when the USB slots on a machine aren't convenient to get at!)"
1,So not worth it,"It's so cheap but it's not even worth the few dollars you spent on. It distorted most of the images when I transferred them form the camera to the PC. It's now in my garbage, four days after I bought it."
3,Only three of the five I received actually worked,"I ordered five. Shipping speed was OK. Only three of the five actually worked. Of the three that worked, SDHC worked just fine, even though the markings on the body only indicate regular SD. Also has mmc and USB 2.0 markings, however, there is no mention of SDHC. But reading my SDHC card was no problem. I used a SanDisk Extreme III 8GB SDHC card for testing purposes. Worked good. On three out of five..."
2,"Wrong item, rude people","I received the wrong item in the mail and when I emailed them they were very rude and told me that they did send the correct item. They said to even compare the picture to mine and when I did, it is Still Wrong! I told them I wasn't mad and that I just wanted to fix the problem without having to pay extra money just to send the thing back. I know that being pissy isn't going to get what you want and so I wasn't but because the customer service person was rude, now I'm mad because I am right. I just want to get what I paid for. I ordered the 4 in 1 and they sent me the 2 in 1. I don't think I'll order from ChiTek again."
1,NEVER WORKS,I Bought this item for $1 but have to pay $8 in shipping but never worked and will never buy the product from the seller for sending a dummy card reader that never works.
4,A Dictionary of the Bengali Language (Bengali English),The book is available. For additional information contact educabook@yahoo.com
2,"""Cutesy-poo"" approach detracts from the content.","The analysis of algorithms is an important aspect of computer programming, and it's actually a pretty interesting study in its own right. That's why the ""gee-whiz"" tone or cutesy-poo approach Rawlings takes in this book is all the more discouraging -- not only is it a distraction, it was unnecessary. Of course, there are those who like the ""cutesy"" approach. Some people think, the more pyrotechnics, monkeyshines and theatrics in a classroom, the better. If that type of instruction pleases you, you might like this book. However, for those who aren't studying the analysis of algorithms for yuks, this book is off-putting. The content of this book is that of a competent work, suitable for a first-semester course in the analysis of algorithms. But it is too much work to separate the content from the lamely facetious, precious manner in which that content is expressed."
4,Something borrowed...,"While this album is really good, it is not their best work, but it is still heads and shoulders above what most bands are able to produce. My only real gripe is that fact that about half the album is material they already released on an ep. It is not a unique tactic to put out an album quickly, but it is still disappointing.Aaron."
3,cute but too light,the book ends are very cute and my daughter loved them. The problem is that they are made out of light wood and do not hold up any books. My daughter uses them as a toy/decoration in her room.
1,Not good book ends,"I too got sucked in by the cuteness. Too bad they don't work as book ends. They are so light, they are a hazard."
3,Disappointing,"This disc is a real let down after the great ""Hey Album"". I really like ""Sugarbuzz"" and ""Little Head"" -- both as catchy and enjoyable as anything on the last album, but there is little else to get excited about. The songs are highly derivative, many bordering on plagiarism....so much so that David Bowie is given co-writing credit on ""Cigarette Lighter Love Song"", due to its resemblance to ""All the Young Dudes"". Even then, the songs aren't too memorable -- a real shame considering how catchy Butch Walker's songs have been in the past."
2,Sugarbuzz indeed,"This is the exact opposite of a great album. A great album makes an impression on you in the first listen, and subsequent spins cause you to fall deeply in love as the depth of the album is revealed to you. This album is infinitely listenable on the first spin, and you will without a doubt be humming along by the end of every song. But one week later, you definitely have a sugarbuzz...too much sweetness and not enough substance leaves you feeling sick. A great album if you dont listen too hard, but its definately not worth a purchase."
1,80's Hair Band style music is gone. Why bring it back?,If you liked Hair Bands from the 80's then you'll like this album. Winger fans will also love it. I hate it! I'm ashamed to say they are from my hometown of Atlanta.
5,Great Album!,"Butch Walker is fantastic and his start with The Marvelous 3 is nothing less than, well, Marvelous!ReadySexGo! is a fun, peppy album that is premium original Butch Walker. This is a must have! Only, seriously!"
3,CATCHY ROCK..!!,"AHHH BUTCH WALKER..!! WAS A FAN WAY BACK WITH SOUTHGANG....FANTASTIC SINGER + GUITARIST + SONGWRITER...THIS IS A GOOD CD....CATCHY SONGS INDEED..BUT CHECK OUT HIS BEST PIECE OF WORK ""LEFT OF SELF CENTRED""..."
4,Sugarbuzzzz.....,"This is the kinda rock that todays music needs. With all the whiny wimps crying about how their lifes suck or the anger fueled semi-rap geeks belching profanity laced diatribes , we seem to forget what what real rock is F U N and man this CD is Fun. Awesome sing along choruses , Guitars and more guitars and witty laugh out loud lyrics ,Butch knows how to twist bend and curve a phrase. Ready Sex Go just flows from song to song, you can't help but sing 'Anymore' over and over during 'Grant Park' , Better Off Alone is a funky rocker, I love the chorus of Sugarbuzz, Radio Tokyo and Supernatural Blonde are great sing along songs. Man alive this Cd is FUN .This is rock like we need. This is music that will have your head spinnng , yer butt shaking and your smile grinning. Ain't that FUN you can bet your Staind Korn Biscuit ina Puddle of Mudd sweet butt it is."
3,"Neat figure, but the fit is lacking.","This figure is a good purchase for those who liked zeta, and liked the design of this suit. It is certainly a striking and unique looking mech, and is pretty posable. The main problem is the overall fit of the pieces. The main problem is the ""gun"", which on mine never fricking fit right. The hand that was supposed to hold it didn't, and the hose didn't fit into the socket on the back right. Without the gun, the figure just looks naked, and defenseless. Transformed however, it still looks great."
1,Women in the Middle East,"I was disappointed by this book because it is mistitled. The writer deals exclusively with gender experiences in the Middle East and seems to forget that most Muslim women are not Arabs. I expected more (Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Africa, the Balkans,......). The book is methodologically unsound for that reason, in my opinion. It reflects a certain personal bias (possibly a sort of pan-Arabism, she thinks non-Arabs are not really Muslims, even if they have been so for centuries?). In the light of her selective observation and distortion of reality in that respect, I can't be bothered commenting on the ""big, male conspiracy"" theory that she outlines..."
2,Pointless repetition,While yes this book holds a lot of information about women and their lives in islamic culture i found this book to be very dry and quite boring. If i did not have to read this for a class i would never read this specific book i would have read more on women in the villages or whatnot. i would not recomend this book to anyone unless you enjoy boring dry books. There are much more interesting books about women in this cultural sense
5,Excellent overview of the subject,Great book. Had to read it for a class and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Gives a great historical background of Islam and Women and the cultural forces in the region. I would recommend this book to anybody interested in the subject
5,Must read for anyone dealing regularly with complexity.,"This is a classic tale of managment philosophy and software engineering. It contains some of the best descriptions of human behavior and engineering intuition ever distilled into book format. A must read for anyone managing, or working on, complex projects of any sort."
1,Not water falls & junk music,There are relative few waterfall scenes. Mostly beach and small waves.BUT they have ruined it all with the junk music they put on it. You can not even hear the natural sounds and there is no way to turn off the music track.FALSE ADVERTISING to the 10th power.
5,Good story in True Conan fashion.,"This was a faithful Conan story. The writing was well done and the art, pencils, shading all enhanced the story. Well worth the read if you like Conan."
2,One of the worst of its' kind,"I like the premise: military has a supernatural entity and brings in a person capable of communicating with it. But it falls apart on almost every level. There are spoilers following.1. If it is so easily capable of possessing people outside of the enclosure, why is it still imprisioned?2. Considering how it was acquired, why are they surprised it is homicidal?3. Why do people who make this kind of movie think that shooting a film in the dark makes up for no real f/x and lousy plot?4. They would have had to try really hard to find characters I could care about less.5. Why bring an American psychic to a Brit military base? England has its' own psychics.The pacing is uneven, the plot has huge holes and the climax of the movie is both not surprising and is disappointing."
3,Great movie on a winter's day,"Hey, I liked this movie! It inspired some sci-fi ruminations, which are enjoyable when it's snowing like crazy outside! I found the premise to be original, the secret project including using political criminals as lab animals. At this point in life, I don't worry about how unlikely each detail is. For that matter, nothing which is supposed to be ""realistic"" really comes close to reproducing The Real, which is unfathomable :)I give this movie 3 stars!"
2,What the heck are they talking about?,"************Spoiler Alert******************************Although this is a horror movie, there isn't much to spoil.I saw this on Instant Video and was ticked off to see that there were no subtitles. Three or four of the main Antagonists (and they are just that) have accents and speech that is not comprehensible to the American ear. The main human bad guy (can't figure out how to spell villian this morning) speaks in a mumbled English accent that is just not understandable.Story reviews are on other reviews. But there is a huge tip off. The main antagonist is not attacked by the entity at all. Makes no sense whatsoever."
1,waste of time and money,Most of this film is shot in the dark. Very difficult to tell what is going on. Has some gore but not much of a horror film. Save your money for something else.
3,"Could have been better, but not as bad as others think.","The premise of STORMHOUSE is very similar to the last 20 minutes of THE ENTITY, a 1981 poltergeist thriller starring Barbara Hershey. In that portion of the film, a group of scientists try to capture a very nasty ghost/rapist, with variable results. STORMHOUSE extends that sequence to an entire feature-length production, likewise with variable results.Most of the movie is low-key and creepy while the ghost is locked up. Once it escapes, the movie descends into slasher-film territory needlessly. Had it not done so, I would have tacked another star onto it."
3,"Serves Its Purpose, But A Little Light","These are great glasses, and they have a relative weight to them, but they're not as heavy as I was expecting. I bought these to replace some restaurant quality glasses my brother in law had broken previously. The base is heavier than something I had held in the store, but the side glass is relatively thing. If you're looking for serious heft and usage, try the restaurant supply store or a barware shop. If you just need an everyday variety of drinking glass, then this will be more than fine."
4,a small book for small hands,"I, first, checked this book out from the local library for my 3 year old son. He is a total car / tractor / airplane type kid. He sits for hours thumbing through this book. This book is the perfect size for his small hands. Amazingly, it is pretty detailed in the amount of information it gives about the different vehicles. If you have a "" car "" kid living in your house, this is a good book to add to their collection of car books."
1,RIP-OFF: DOESN'T WORK,"I echo the previous reviewer. I checked around the web and some reviews indicated they worked. Sorry I ordered them. Don't work alone, don't work wet, don't work with a gel.Simply don't work.It's a black mark on Amazon.com that they can't be returned. Something that doesn't work as promised should be able to be returned--no matter what that item is."
3,"Not bad, but...","This book is pretty good if you are a guy like me that enjoys the sex appeal of a men's mag cover before the days of silicone. Interesting tidbits of info about each title, it's too bad there's very little to tell about some. The layout of the book is a tad flat. All in all, not bad. A fine resource for artists and designers that dig the classic men's magazine look."
2,not a movie,"this is not a movie, but just a preview for a movie, that may or may not ever be made. the only reason i did not send it back was, i am a huge driver fan"
3,good product misleading picture,"The product works fine, but the color on the picture is misleading. I wanted it brown as on the picture, in reality it is very dark, indistinguishable from black."
4,Much better than a 'standard' size mill,"For years I've been using store bought, plastic disposable pre-filled pepper mills or regular pepper mills from a set. This is definitely an upgrade and I can't, for the life of me, understand why it took so long to buy something like this. Aside from that, I can never get a good chunky grind. It's really good at fine - medium."
5,Grinds pepper and looks good to boot,"I was frustrated with my small table grinder as I often grab it to grind fresh pepper for cooking. It just wasn't up to the task - so I bought this in hopes it woudl. It's a great pepper grinder. the adjustment is easy, but not overly loose, and it grinds a great deal of pepper (especially on the coarse setting) with just a few twists. Need less, or a finer grind, adjust the nut (knob?) on top and you've got it. The materials seem well made, and I expect to have this around for years to come."
3,Softwalk Clog,"I tried Softwalk for the first time. Either I should have ordered a half size larger or been more mindful of the toe box. On the first day I wore the shoe to work, I had to change to a more comfortable shoe in order to get through the day. There seemed to be a number of stress points, particularly in the toe. They have felt better with a second wear. The appearance surprised me in that the picture does not note just how much flower image is on the shoe.K.Corn- Arkadelphia, AR"
2,"great product, be aware that there are two bottle sizes","The product is great. My dog has been leaking less since using it so I do recommend the product itself. However, when comparing prices looking for the best deal, I came across the listing from Pet Food Direct and it doesn't give a detailed description of the product. Most of the listings are for a 90 ct bottle and this one was a 45 count bottle. The only way to notice this is if you look closely at the photo of the product and see the ""45"" on the label. I basically paid about $.50 less for a 45 ct bottle than I would have paid for a 90ct bottle as a result.Bladder Strength Dog, 90 Chew Tabs"
1,Poor product for my pet,My pet is a senior and has pretty bad incontinence so I was desperate to try anything.. She has been on this product for about a month now (following the directions very carefully) and there has been ZERO improvement. I usually has very positive feedback where I believe that most things work but in this case for my Molly (16 year old Doxie) we are still on the search for something natural yet effective. ;-(
3,chameleon effect dies after awhile,I've had this for about a year. At first it was great and now it no longer changes colors. Not sure what the life of the color change should be but I was hoping it would be longer.
1,"If you already have the 1st. edition of the book, don't buy this one.","This current book is just a re-print of the 1st. edition. If you already have the old one, don't buy this one.There should have been notes from Amazon indicating the fact this book was just a re-print!Also, this book weighs more than the 1st. one due to the paper type used for its printing. The authorhad already finished approximately 90% of material that was current. The publisher could have waiteda little longer for him to finish the remaining 10% then print a revised edition.What a disappointment in buying this book."
5,The Missing Link to TCP/IP,I believe this is the book that fills in the gap betweenthe classic texts by W. Richard Stevens and UNIX SystemAdministration Texts such as USAH and Essential UNIX Administration. I am a Senior UNIX Administrator and I reallyenjoyed reading through this book cover to cover reviewingmy previous knowledge of TCP/IP and picking up new ideasalong the way. Way to go Niall!
3,Jewel of the Moon,Nice mix of early? Kotzwinkle. For some reason I didn't realize that it was a collection of short stories but I did enjoy nearly all of them.
5,A simple guide to birth control,I was searching for a book which will help me to choose a proper birth control method. I was frustrated when I searched the internet because I could not get the answers to my questions.I'm happy that I bought this book. In 1 hour I learned more about birth control than all the sex education classes taught me. I would highly recommend this book to any women who is having sex and does not want to get pregnant.
3,Another great book from Denise Domning,This is the second book of the series. (If you can call two books a series?) Again the author does a good job with character development and scene set up. However I only gave it three stars because I felt that too much time was given to yearnings and lamentations about how love could not possibly be allowed to exist by both Jamie and Lady Purfoy and by Nick and Cecily. I found after awhile I was skimming over these parts. There is a little surprise at the end that was creatively done and I enjoyed that as well. I don't want to spoil the fun so will not go on. I will go on read her other books. It is hard to find a good author.
5,I highly recommend Lady in White,"Denise Domning is a very gifted story teller. She has superbly captured the life and times that were the Elizabethan age. Her characters come to life on the page and make you feel that you have known them for years. From the page one you find yourself caring about what happens to them. Denise's ability to weave fact and fiction with a healthy dose of intrigue, will keep you reading, not wanting to put your e-reader down! Lady in White is set against the backdrop of the religious movement in Elizabethan England. The Church of England was the voice of religion and Elizabeth I was the head of the church. You will believe that you have actually met Elizabeth I and know what it was like to be a member of her court and have it your bounden duty to abide by her every whim and decision. I highly recommend Lady in White to all who what to read a touching romance while learning about history."
4,A good read,"I liked this book overall. The story was good. The deviations from the normal romance plot made the book more interesting. I think the title fits poorly as the ghost was a really minor part of the plot. It seems to imply it is a supernatural ghost story/ romance, which is isn't. It is a romance novel that happens to have a supernatural element to it. This part of the plot seems like it was meant to be a larger part, but as minimized to allow the larger romance/ friendship theme more attention. This will not keep you from enjoying the book though. Enjoy!"
1,Dark and boring,"I love this author but for the life of me I just could not get into this book, it was so unreal and dark. Sorry I did finish reading it but it left me flat and bored."
4,This book is wonderfly entrancing!,"I first read this book six years ago when I was twelve. Recently I was going through some old boxes and I found this old dusty book. I read it and just like that I fell in love with reading all over again.I definetly recomend reading all of the books in this series.(Dragon's Gold, Serpent's Silver, Chimaera's Copper, Orc's Opal, and finally Mouvar's Magic.)"
5,"Witty, Caustic, and Creative Indictment of Academia","This book is in the form of a narrative dialogue between a professor and a former student in a Tijuana bar over the course of a few days. This bar in Tijuanna is the last place the former student (now a failing salesman) expected to find the straight-laced processor slamming tequilla shots and lecturing on the ""History of Paleothic Education"".The professor's lectures explore the reasons why the education system, generally, and academia, specifically, have failed to innovate and evolve, by spinning an allegorical tale of the history of the educational curriculum in a paleolithic tribe.Funny, witty, entertaining, and a very fast read (I read it in around 3 hours), this book is a must read not only for those in academia, but for anyone that had, or has, to do dogmatic, antiquated, and non-sensical tasks in their school and/or workplace.A true gem"
1,Refused to finish the book- It made me SICK,"I agree with all the complaints I have read here, this is my very FIRST review I have ever written on any product and I have been using amazon for years. I wish I would have read reviews before I purchased the book, I normally do however I was in a hurry and wanting something asap when I found out I was having twins. This book is all about the author and her own experience and about everything that can go wrong. It does not have healthy beneficial advice or outlooks on having a happy ending. I hope that more people will write a review, I am actually so upset about what I did read that I intend to try to contact the author."
1,"personal experience disguided as ""scientific''","I thought this book was really bad- it presents itself as a guidebook for having healthy twins, but it is based primarily on the writer s own experience of having twins, and it contains a lot of unscientific statements and advice about how to 'talk to your headache'. There are much better books out there that are actually based on sound research."
2,twin mommy,"I did not like this book at all. It was hard enough to find a book on twin pregnancies period. Once I got this one all it did was scare me to death, talking mostly of all the things that could go wrong. That I already knew, I wanted to know what to expect with a healthy pregnancy. I switched to Your pregnancy week by week. It gave me the info I needed plus an info page on multiple pregnancy. This one was put away. I did end up losing one of my twins to a birth defect, however, I don't feel this book prepared me for what to expect. I gave it 2 stars because it did have some helpful info on diet and fluid intake."
2,Dr. Leiter's book on Twins,"I must say that I was hoping for more detail on some of aspects of the book. While I do appreciate the section on IVF, since I did IVF myself, I would have preferred more focus on what to expect as the months go by in addition to what you should expect overall per trimester. Bottom line, I know that it will be hard to find a book that meets ALL of my particular needs or desires as I go through my pregnancy. I will say this much, it's exciting and my husband and I are truly blessed that we are having twins!"
1,Everything You Need to Know to Have a Fearful Twin Pregnancy!,"The title of this book is very misleading. Instead of telling readers how to have a healthy pregnancy, the author lists major complications one after another. There were way too many statistics and percentages and I felt like I was reading the same information over and over. This book was very scary to read and offered no reassurance that a multiple pregnancy would end happily. I would definitely not recommend this book to any pregnant women."
4,work well,"this item works well but it has a bit of a pungent smell. when i dilute it, it works well."
3,packaging of lysol,It would better serve my purpose or use to have the product available by the case instead of packs of 3. I think it would be easier and cheaper to ship by the case. I also would like to receive my whole shipment at once.
3,"Basics, Just the Basics","This book is very basic and doesn't go into great detail. I have already found an inaccuracy that is really hard to locate the proper measurement elsewhere. Good book to have for basic repairs, just use with a grain of salt."
5,Fun and Informative,"This is a wonderful collection of stories for any dog owner or dog lover.The tales are heartwarming, insightful and humorous and I picked up a few tips on my own dogs' behavior as well."
1,Not worth the money.,"I received this item, which was intended as a holiday gift, and was surprised by the poor quality. It is very thin, not well put together, and just all around cheap. I am returning it and will have to go out and purchase another one - at the mall. Which really irritates me, as I had managed to do all my shopping online this year."
5,GREAT,"It was the greatest video I'd ever seen, but I usually rent nature documentries and whack off to the female gorillas, anyway GREAT MOVIE!"
5,Does the job -- instructions need to be clearer,"Instructions say:3. ""... Use less than 9 Kgs strenghth can pull it off."" What it means is ""You can use less than 9 Kgs strength to pull the handle off the block so that you can slide out the blades.""The device does the job with a reasonable price."
4,But this if you love creative things!,"Have a taster of being in charge of a bustling hospital. Enjoy the ups and downs as well as the money and bankruptcy.I love this game because of the feel of being in charge and bossing everyone about continuously! Build scanners, wards, reception, and well, nearly everything you can think of!Some of the' illnesses' may come as a little joke to you e.g. inflation of the head' (where the man/woman head has completely expanded) but consequences could be fatal if you let them go untreated. May they rest in peace!The slight problem in the game is it can get confusing, and boring, it's all the same thing through the game: cure people.The graphics are not great either, but if you like comics, this cartoony style of graphic is the one for you!I love this game because of the strategy involved, and the level of difficulty in the game. I would recommend this to people above 8+. Believe me it's really a good laugh!"
5,Know how to run a hospital lol,I love this game. Its so addictive and its so much fun. It always gets harder as you get to the next level and there is so many little funny things about it. Like the machines that they operate. For example: theres a machine that is suppose to get a person with a swelled head back to a normal size head and the head actually pops lol. Theres nothing like bloody about it. Its just plain fun and its been one of my fav games since it came out.
5,THE WONDER THAT IS THEME HOSPITAL!!!,THEME HOSPITAL IS INDEED ADDICTIVE AND SO INFURIATING WHEN YOU WATCH YOUR STATUS GET LOWER AND LOWER AND THEN YOU DIE. WHAT A TERRIBLE FEELING!! COMPARE THIS WITH THE AMAZING FEELING ONE GETS WHEN HAVING COMPLETED A LEVEL AND YOU ARE WAITING FOR THE LETTER TO ARRIVE FROM THE MINISTERY OF HEALTH. BUT HOW CAN I IMPROVE MY REPUTATION?!?!? IT IS SOOOO HARD!
1,Incompatibility,Just thought i should let everyone know that this game is INCOMPATIBLE with any 64 bit operating system. Moth balls.
1,Very Disappointed,"I used to play this game when I was little with my Uncle so I was VERY excited to be able to play it again, however when I got it and tried to install it on my computer it said that it wasn't compatible with my 64 bit computer. If I would of known that I would of never wasted my money on it in the first place, but it said no where in the description it wasn't compatible. When I emailed the company to see if I could return it they refused and said no because I opened it up. Now i'm stuck with a game I can't play!"
1,Did not work for my computer!,Total waste of money for me personally because I waited so long for it and it works with special computers :PGo to gog.com (good old games) really reliable 7 dollar download :)
2,"great game, horrid re-release","the game is the original and that is fun, goofy campy, corny fun. but the softaware and the support are horrendous, i tried to re-install on my recently purchased computer (vista home premium) and could install but not play it"
5,Awesome Game,"This is honestly one of my most favorite games ever. It's over 10 years old but I still get it out several times a year and play through it again. I love curing bloaty head, invisibility, and the King Syndrome (makes them look like Elvis). Such a great game!"
4,Great game but not for Vista,I love this game but I have to play it on my sister's computer because it is not compatible with Vista :(.
2,Iffy,"This game is super fun and I've played it many of times before and know all the ends and outs. However, this game won't play on my computer (Windows 7) and it is very choppy looking! I realize it is an older game, but still it should have better quality then my game does. I've also tried to contact the seller about this and I have received nothing back! Poor customer service!"
4,Not Stasheff's best,"While this book was by no stretch Stasheff's best novel, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It seems that Magnus is finally coming into his own, although he could certainly lighten up a bit. The only thing that I didn't like about the book is unfixable - it didn't include the other Gallowglass family members. To me the best part of the other books was the family interaction and that, of course, is missing from this one."
2,disapointed,I usually enjoy reading Christopher Stasheff but this book was a big disapointment. It is kind of monotonous without a good plot or much action. I don't reccomend this book to anyone.
3,According to This Book I'm Dead!,"The author apparently did not do his homework very well. He refers to me as: ""the late Frank Mundus."" However, I'm very much alive. If you don't believe me, check out my website at www.fmundus.com.--Frank Mundus"
5,"36"" TREE LOPPER","EASY TO USE, LIGHT WEIGHT, POWERFUL FOR IT'S SIZE AND WEIGHT. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANY SCRAWNY WOMAN (LIKE ME) FOR TRIM WORK."
1,False advertising rip-off,"I cannot believe the ineptitude and moral flatulence that this company works with. Not only was the product not advertised correctly, it was intentionally misleading. With words like ""selection"" and ""five"" and ""assorted"" combined with a clear picture of five different products, I expected to receive five. (Silly me.)Not only did I only receive one item, but when I told them how outraged I was they wanted me to send it back in the box it came in. I would have been happy to do this had the box not been completely tattered and unfit for reuse. So here I am, paying full price for a tiny little bottle and can't even return it for a refund.I would advise anyone considering using this company to quickly abort any further thoughts - they are unfit for entrepreneurial endeavors and certainly not worth your time as a simple sales office."
4,Great Cable!,"I love the durability of this cable. I use it running out of my effects board into my amplifier and it's flawless. I've gigged with it numerous times and it's always held up well. The only complaint I have about any Monster cable is how stiff they are. They're thick & shielded, which is good, but they don't like to be coiled up for storage. Don't hesitate to buy it because of that though, it's a great cable."
1,Poor Poor Sound Quality,"I had gone through a few XLR cables that would start off good but the internal connections would break after a while. So I bought this Monster cable after reading the mostly great reviews on Amazon. I regretted it. The sound was dull using this cable. The dynamic range was gone and the vocals were compressed. I could not believe it, so I connect an old cable in the same setup to do A-B comparisons. The cheapo cable was bright and crisp while this was dull and uninspiring. I never used to believe a cable could make such an audible difference, but this cable proved it. I repeated the A-B comparisons for about 5 days just to be sure and then returned it. Monster has always been talked about as being overpriced and under-performing but I did not believe it till now. I will not touch monster stuff again. I suggest you do not take a chance either, and buy something nicer for the money you will be spending."
2,Not what I expected,"Some of that is due to the fact that nicer graphics are shown on the package. As others have said, these are graphics from the 80s. Second, the remotes don't work as well as they should for a game that requires you to quickly buzz in your answer. Third, some of the questions are too easy. It's nice to have some questions you know, but when everyone is getting 900-1000 (Unless their remote won't let them buzz in) then you know the question is too easy."
1,Terrible Game,I got this game for Christmas and it was just awful.. The graphics are terrible and the remotes barely worked. It's like one of those games that are plain awful. Don't waste your money!
1,Don't bother,"I received this game in a Yankee Swap at work. I enjoy trivia, so I was excited to try it out with my brother over the holidays. It takes 8 batteries (4 for the console and 2 for each controller) and the signal between the controllers and console is horrible. We could barely get past entering our names into the system. We ended up taking all the batteries out and throwing the whole thing away. Way too much aggravation for a Yankee Swap gift someone spent $5 on."
3,Get the accessories,"My husband loves, loves, loves this game in the bar at SPI, TX. I just couldn't resist when I saw it on Amazon. I am glad I got it because we had so much fun during the vacation days. Sadly, I saw it for $4 at Tuesday Morning after I had already paid for it at Amazon. It was still worth what I paid because I didn't even know it was available until I saw it on Amazon. You do need the extra cartridges though because even though this has lots of questions, you see them again and again for some reason....maybe why it ended up at the other store?"
3,Buzztime Trivia Review,"The trivia system is entirely battery opperated, which is an inconvenience. It would be better if there were a converter that I could plug in. If you don't change the batteries immedietly on the main operating system all high scores may be lost. I also have experienced a lot of repeat questions, the system doesn't do a very good job of determining if the questions have been used yet. Additional question cartridges can be purchased and they contain only 250 questions each. Otherwise, it has been fun to play!"
1,Not worth the money.,"We bought this game thinking it would be fun for our regular game nights with friends. We were very disappointed. The game is poorly constructed. The remotes are flimsy and I would be affraid of easy breakage. The IR signal is very weak (we were within 4 feet from the system and half the time it would not register). The base only runds on batteries and is a huge memory hog. The questions were very easy and repeat often. The graphics are horrible, the are about what you would expect from an Atari game around 1980, not at all upto current standards. For the cost the Trival Pursuit DVD editions beat this game hands down!"
2,Needs to learn how not to repeat questions,"I thought this game was fun, for the first couple of games. Sure, the remotes are infrared with a range of about 8 feet (when you point STRAIGHT at the console), some of the words are spelled wrong, most of the questions are about art and history, and the graphics are on par with those plug-n-play joystick games, but the one thing that really got me was when it started repeating questions after TWO GAMES. The third game introduced us to repeat questions. There are 750 games, and we had seen just over 30 of them... Save your money, get You Don't Know Jack or just play Trivia pursuit. Stay Away!"
1,Buzztime is not worth the money,This game has the graphics of an atari game and is fairly expensive. The game would be worth it if it costs $10 but not the $50 or $70 that we paid for four controlers. Save your money. I was very disappointed with this game.
2,Not worth it,"My husband and I decided to purchase and play this game for ourselves before getting another to give as a gift. I'm so happy that we tried it first. We were so disappointed, and we promply returned it the next day. We bought the ""Deluxe"" version with 4 controllers and additional question; however 1 match between the 2 of us was all it took to make our decision. The graphics and music left much to be desired (think early Nintendo); the questions were okay but the clues were really cheesey; we quickly figured out that you can change your answer at the last minute, so there was no penalty for guessing right off the bat (for higher points). Overall, it was not challenging, not impressive, and not worth the money."
1,its too bad,"I bought this thinking it would be really cool to play pool and play this game on our projector Tv which the screen is at least 90"".But the words were cut off!Not to mention the graphics ,for the price, were very bad.We had the same problem of it not counting our score properly and many other dissapointing factors.I took it back to where I bought it and got my money back.I wish Gamecube or Xbox would come up with some trivia thing like that.They have wireless remotes that work and I bet there graphics and ?'s would be better!"
3,"Completely artless, entertains tho.","I especially like the way this book ties together the histories of Freddy and Jason in more detail than the movie did. All the past movies are referenced and it all feels more connected.Plus, this book was taken from the original script and contains a few extra bits that were not in the movie (save the dumb ending) such as Jason attacking Linderman at the rave and the girls in the jeep almost running over Jason when he crosses the road at the cornfields.Apart from that it's the same as the movie. There's no art in adapting a script into a novel but it's still an interesting read and moves at a fast pace. Tho I was let down by the dumb ending that was totally different from the movie and didn't make sense.Tip: Don't bother reading this for English class. Like I said twice already; it's artless and not anything you can go deep into."
5,a good movie,All i know is i have seen the movie and it was very good so i hope the book will be as good as the movie.
4,Cuter than it looks,"The girl of my affection is a beanie baby fanatic, so I decided to get her this one (as it appeals to our sense of humor). It looks just like the picture in color and proportion, but this little bear has character. I'd highly recommend it to anyone with an eye for beanie babies."
5,Cute,"Great product really good service, I've ordered from this company before and never had problems they have really cute bears"
4,You must listen to Bill,"Some of the songs are a little unknown and not often done by other artist.This cd is great value for money for fans of Mr. Henderson. Buy also, if possible vol.1. What ever happened to the LP ""Live atthe Times""?"
4,China takes on a hot potato!,"The hot potato is a popular high school football coach who China finds out has made a habit of abusing young teenage girls. He left his previous post under a bit of a cloud and one of his former ""pupils"" is found dead apparently of suicide in a Pecan Springs hotel room. The deeper China digs, the more it becomes apparent that this coach is guilty. This book is all about China. We don't see much of her husband, McQuaid, or Ruby either for that matter, but it's still a really good book. Ms. Albert handles this delicate problem with tact and she makes a darn good yarn out of it. I've been reading China Bayles books for six years now, and I look forward to each new one that comes out."
4,"Excellent novel, innovative, entertaining, interesting","The great thing about BLEEDING HEARTS is that Albert is really expanding her series to new levels. As with every book she tries something new without alienating readers who like China Bayles, Ruby Wilcox and the rest of the gang in Pecan Springs. But although this is an entertaining read, Albert does not view small town life through rose-colored lenses. BLEEDING HEARTS gets to the heart of some deeply disturbing questions that many small towns must face. Further, Albert introduces an interesting back-story about China's personal family history that she carries through the next two books (SPANISH DAGGER and NIGHTSHADE), making this trilogy-within-a-series a compelling and suspenseful enterprise well worth the time of any reader interested in good mysteries and entertaining literature. Bravo."
5,One of the best shows ever!!!,"I was 8-10 years old when Degrassi Jr High/High was on the air. I looked up to those characters and wanted my school experience to mimick some of the fun they shared. To this day, I am still a fan and I never get tired of the episodes. I find something new in each of them every time I watch. This show is for old and new fans alike. Way better than the next generation Degrassi series."
5,Brings back memories,So glad that I purchased this box set. I've been waiting to get this on DVD since I found out that the VHS compilation had been out for a while. I was finally able to see all the episodes that I missed and also see the infamous School's Out movie. It was all worth the wait. It was nice to see things as they were when I was in HS.
5,Guilty pleasure!,"I can't help but love this show, even though it is definitely a guilty pleasure. Once you start watching, you can't stop!"
5,Reliving my teen years,I decided to let loose and treat myself to things I have been wanting for Christmas and so glad I did!!!
5,Give the conspiracie theories a break !!,Very interesting !!! People need to forget all these conspiracie theories and just realize that these people are the ones that destroyed these powerful good men we all loved.
4,Not bad at all,"This book is about the life of a hired assassin Triste during the heavy pro-peronist period. The author did a very good job at showing us the humane side of the hero (or in this case the anti-hero) and at reflecting the argentine society and politics of that time through the eyes of Triste and his friend Chavez. I enjoyed reading the book in english, the translation was easy and smooth. And in addition I learned a lot about argentine history/politics in a nice enjoyable way. I recommend that you read this book especially if you enjoy political thrillers."
5,The Empty Church--A wake up call for mainline Christians,"In a straight forward easy to understand manner Mr. Reeves describes the reasons why the mainline Protestant Churches have been losing membership year after year for over 30 years. For many of us who were brought up in these Churches and rely on them for our spiritual home, his comments are similar to what we have witnessed in our own demoninations during recent decades. The local churches for the most part continue to follow traditional Christian beliefs and principles while the central church ""leaders"" seek to transform the Church into instruments for very liberal social agendas. His call to arms for local churches and concerned Church men and women to reclaim leadership and direction in our demoninations is both well thought out and presented. I recommend this book highly to anyone who is concerned about the direction in his or her church."
1,Liberal Bashing Disguised as History,"This book fails almost from the first page to deliver on its promise reasons for the decline of mainline religion in the U.S. It is a simple-minded hostile attack on liberals of every stripe full of non sequiturs and logical fallacies. If you want to learn about the reasons for the decline of organized religion, you will have to look for a balanced, objective treatment elsewhere."
5,Great!!!,This computer works great for buisness and is great for DVD movies!It is a great laptop but it is heavy.That is the only problem with it.
1,HP consumer service is to be watched,A month ago I bought two hp compaq nc 6000. A week after one started showing random problems with the display at sartup. It was sent for repair and returned with no repair done as the problem did not came out during the eight days it was in repair.Nex week I will return the machine for repair again but latelly I have been readin a lot about how bad HP service has become.My advise would be to stay away from HP products.
4,pulsating with Super Beats,"what an amazing album. chilled and inventive breaks in the style of Fila Brazillia with the same attention to craft and sonic ingenuity. the album has two covers: Superfly by Curtis Mayfield and Paris Match by the Style Council. the former oozes with funk and momentum while the latter seethes... [amazingly] with drum and bass undertones frittering gently away in an original rendition that had me diving for the track listing. the album has some vocals and sampled sounds and is an incredible listen to a sophisticated ear in a variety of settings. the second song Address of the Sun sounds exactly like David Bowie and again I had to double check the credits. the overall album, while down tempo for several cuts, has a humour and creativity that is refreshing and rewarding. Poppy and clever? yes....highly recommended!"
1,Broke and Leaks,"Don't buy this cap. It's totally noisy when air leaks out (the first time i heard this noise, I was driving and it was so loud that it scared me--i thought something was wrong with my car). This also is not a leak-proof cap, though i don't think it was intended to be or claims to be. The cap over the spout broke off after a few weeks, and then the loop connecting the cap to the bottle broke. Buy the sport cap 2.0 instead (but make sure not to buy the recalled version). I still love Kleen Kanteen, but this cap is worthless."
1,Not big enough for large people,"it is just too small for larger people - not comfortable at all. When fully inflated and sat upon by a large person - the excess flesh that spills over the dimensions of the cushion are left ""hanging"" - shall we say - hence leaving the sitter with the feeling of something bulging underneath - and if you have a sore tailbone - this will only magnify the problem..........."
1,not as described,This product is actually more of a short mattress-may be useful for tent camping. Itis not a seat cushion. I returned it
4,Happy Camper,"I'm using it right now on my office chair. It should be great on a long airplane ride or anyplace I go where I sit for a long time. I don't have a lot of ""padding"" on my hind side, so this is great"
5,Relief at Last!,I use this for long car rides...can be inflated and deflated while I'm sitting on it! It's big enough to cover the whole car seat too and it stays put. Really comfortable and reasonably priced.
4,FAMILY CLASSIC,"This movie is a love story which turns into a revenge . it has action, love, and betrayal. jimmy is a young man that falls in love with the sentors daughter played by maureen mccormick his father is killed by sentors son whos played by buck taylor. he joins the pony express to fine the killer. its slow moving .but it has a good story line . Big names and if you like westerns this is a movie for the whole family"
2,A skeleton of what a Quality Plan should cover,"If you have no plan at all, this will help in making sure all 20 elements are covered. The word documents that are included with the book are skeletonized with generic verbiage. This is a good first step but that is exactly what it is - a FIRST STEP. It helps you develop a generic manual. Gaining a full understanding of the ISO 9000 way will require considerably more reading."
4,"Beautiful - But Know, It's Not the Original","Just got this book, a gift from my wife, excited to come home to an old friend in John Fowles.A cursory look yields a rich little book, with beautiful photography by William Neill, and excerpts of the original text of ""The Tree"" by Fowles.Be mindful - it is, however, not the original book, with the text by Fowles, and photography by Frank Horvat. A perfectly satisfying second version, with Mr. Neill's exquisite work studding the book throughout; but those looking for Fowles's full essay will be disappointed."
4,Dirty Little Dirt Devil,Pretty rugged - handy for multi-tasking. Don't go too nuts trying to dig in heavily compacted soil even this will bend. But overall this rake/hoe can do its duties well.
5,Absolutly incredible,"I read reviews about the Thorne rooms and was so impressed that I bought this book, site unseen. It's absolutly breathtaking. I was just amazed at the quality of the minatures.The thing that struck me the most about this book though is the taste of the subject matter. Mrs Thorne had a fantasic eye for the classically beautiful and made a lifes work out of reproducing it for the enjoyment of others.This lady doesn't just cover different styles from different centuries. She showcases some of the most beautiful trends and styles from several different nations in a deceptivly simple format.The whole concept and execution is just astonishing. A must for an interior designer or anyone who genuinely loves period style."
3,Not what I expected,"I anticipated a book that would capture the attention of elementary-age children who had been through traumtic situations-- this book did not accomplish that goal. Many of the concepts were good, however the book was not easy for my clients to follow. I was looking for a book that would also apply to children in homes of relatives not just in foster care. I was disappointed. A certified trauma consultant/licensed social worker."
1,don't get this,"when i ordered this i didn't notice the ""easy"" crap in the corner. these tabs are wrong. they don't sound like the songs and there are no solos. i am returning this as we speak."
2,neck wallet,"the pockets are too small for my needs, actually after trying to put all the various items i wanted to carry it did not function as expected"
3,Light weight travel accessory,"We needed this and used it, it is light and compact. Did not like the plastic liner that would fold up inside, it should be attached somehow so it doesn't crumple down. I like the idea of the plastic liner, if you get wet somehow or are sweating, it's a good idea. My husband wore this one and I wore a different brand, I liked mine better."
2,I'd choose something else,"Pros - holds everything you need (money, passport, tickets, etc)Cons - not comfortable to wear and pretty noticeableNo matter what type of shirt I wore (sweater, button down, polo style) I could tell when looking in the mirror that I was wearing it. The corners are pretty noticeable and I just did not find it comfortable around my neck."
3,useful but clumsy to use,"I purchased the neck wallet and the money belt. I found the belt easier to use and less bulky under clothes, Both products are made of a nice light weight material that is comfortable on your skin"
2,Strap broke day 8 of trip,"I bought this for my trip to Italy. I had read that wearing a purse in Rome is a bad idea since people in mopeds will just drive by and grab the purse right off your shoulder. So I decided to give this neck wallet thing a try. I wore it under my shirt while in Rome, but it was bulky and definitely a nuisance having to pull it out of my shirt each time I went to pay for something. On top of that the strap broke off after about 8 days. However, it did give me a sense of security (at least before the strap broke) and I had no problems with pickpockets. My friend, however, did decide to bring a purse on the trip. One night someone leaned out of the window of a passing car, grabbed her purse, and drove off, dragging her for several feet before she was able to let go of the purse. So while I think the idea of the neck wallet is great and I am glad that I bought one, next time I'd definitely go either with one of higher quality or try the belt kind."
3,Good,"The product itself is very good, with comfortable material and soft to wear around the neck ...But I would recommend more on the hidden cover underpockets which are available in the market as it is very uncomfortable to carry the documents around your neck...Hence we hardly ended up using it on our travel..."
3,Poor stiching detail,"Beware of RS neck wallet stitching. On my way through the airport terminal for the start of a recent trip, one strap end came off the neck wallet suddenly without provocation. Had this not happened I wouldn't have known how tenuous the connection was and might have been the victim of someone stealing the wallet with ease.I looked at several neck wallets beforehand and had even read a review about the faulty construction, but considered it a one-off issue.Along with strengthening the stitching, I suggest redesign to make the zipper long enough to slip a passport in side-in instead of short-edge in, for an added way to stash the passport."
2,flimsy string holds it together,"If it wasn't for the flimsy string it would be good. I travel frequently and it survived about 4 trips before one of the neck strings ripped off. it is not durable. I suppose if you don't put too much in it, and only wear it under a shirt it would be okay. But it was disappointing."
4,It held our stuff when we went to Cancun.,"It was nice to know everything was safely inside our pouch. Not the most convenient way to carry items in my opinion, but it served its purpose at a pretty decent price."
4,Neck wallet,"This item worked well on our trip. It has handy pockets for a passport, tickets, money, & credit cards. It has an adjustable neck strap. It is slim, lightweight & washable. It can be worn on the inside or outside of a shirt."
3,Redesign of zipper required,"Item is made of durable material and the pockets are amply sized. Unfortunately, the zipper pull is very small and broke with the first travel use."
1,Not a traveler's friend,"This money bag was fragile, and therefore a traveler's nightmare! The weak strap on mine broke in Toledo, and because of its silky and light design, I didn't even feel it fall off. Thank god my friend saw it fall because it contained my passport, money, and other essentials. I would not recommend this to ANYONE who wants to keep their things safe and secure."
4,Handy item for travelers,"We purchased one of these for each of us and am glad we did. It was a handy way to keep track of all of our travel documents while our hands were full of luggage. The workmanship seemed fine and the material was comfortable against the skin. The only thing I can really nit-pick is the plastic sleeve inside. It should be of a softer/more-flexible material so it's a bit less conspicuous and stiff when wearing the pouch inside one's shirt. I've considered removing the sleeve entirely, but it is good protection. I kind of wish the front pocket had a separate (not as deep) pocket within it which was exactly passport depth. The (open) rear pocket is excellent for tickets, boarding passes and other travel-essential documents that tend to be longer."
4,Works well,It worked really well. The internal plastic liner was a pice of junk.I just put my passport in a small ziplock bag and that worked really well.
3,OK,I never really got to use this as the reason for the use never happened but I am keepting it as I will probably had a use for it in the future.
4,finest flowers,"beautiful as it is inspiring, love the designs and the methods,you must have plenty of time to attempt them."
5,Redoute's Finest Flowers in Embroidery,"I bought this sight unseen which is unlike me but this surely would cause me to try that again !!! It is a needlework book of a higher level. By that I mean the novice and the expert can do it; only skill improves the work appearance. It is fully creative embroidery. I am making all 17 project designs and developing them into a moire quilt or cushions. The designs are smallish (5"" or so ) but can then be incorporated into whatever your heart desires. They are very fast to do with any fabric of your choice for any textile idea you might hae in botanicals."
3,Acceptable to some?,"I have found this book to be a disappointment, but only because I already own Trish Burr's Long & Short Stitch Flowers. The text is basically a copy of Long & Short Stitch and the embroidery appears to be not as refined. No need to own both."
1,Worst kit lens among any SLR brands,"I am pretty sure that this is the worst kit lens among any SRL brands(Nikon, Canon, Sony, Olympus, etc). You might better use a decent pointand shoot, if you are going to use this lens. True, it is good enough""for the price"". But then why would you buy a porche and install a cheapo$50 tires ? I wish Pentax built a better kit lens which is $30-50 moreexpensive, which matches or exceeds the quality of Nikon, Canon, or Sony."
1,Neil Young perverted,"As a big bluegrass fan and longtime adorer of Neil, this album completely misses the mark. If you want bluegrass, find Scruggs, Flatt -- if you want Neil, get Harvest Moon or Time Fades Away. But this is just muzak fluff that satisfies neither urge for Neil or bluegrass. Money could be spent better."
4,Great alternative to Kraft,"My kids have always preferred Kraft Mac & Cheese. *I* did not prefer it's ingredients but I relented because they liked it. I took a chance and ordered this mac & cheese hoping they would like it. I have purchased other organics (like Annie's) which they hated so I wasn't holding out much hope. I made it in place of the Kraft for dinner one night and there wasn't even a comment made about the switch! They ate it up and wanted seconds! This is now a staple in my pantry and I feel better about serving mac & cheese twice a month or so since it's ingredients are organic. If your kids like Kraft but don't like Annie's, I encourage you to try Back to Nature"
5,easy & healthy,Bought this for a 6 yr old with a sore mouth (having dental work done). She loved these and I felt good because she wasn't getting any chemicals or preservatives.
3,Funky Cheese,"I love these, but sometimes the cheese doesn't mix in as easy as the less healthy versions. When it doesn't mix well, the cheese powder has kind of a funky, spicy flavor. Other than that, good product."
4,for whoever still may play Dune2000,I purchased this book at EB (Electronics Boutique) at the mall for 9 cents. See if they have it before you shell out 18$. And yes it was a good strategy guide.
1,Dune and this book STINK!!!!,"IF you really want a good strategy game, look at Westwood's upcoming release. The best game, Command&Conquer: Tiberian Sun. It is much better."
3,Much ado about a little.,"I don`t know why there is such a fuss over this singer and why her material is so expensive. She does swing with a jazz accompaniment, but the tone of her voice annoys me somewhat, especially wnen she hits such low notes unnecessarily."
3,"Not as ""different"" as I had hoped but still good.","I was hoping for some really different ideas. Some were but others were common knowledge ideas. All in all, I don't really regret the purchase."
4,kids books,"great book. if you are into creating things at home, this is it. easy instructions and fun for everyone in the family."
4,Did not live up to expectations,"Had some good ideas, but not as many as I expected for what I paid. It was kinda fun, but just expected more I guess."
1,Not really kid friendly,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She was really excited because she is the Science/Experiemntal type. As we started thumbing throught the book, we realized that the title is misleading. The title doesn't suggest that the book is a craft book but we did find craft ideas. Very horrible tasting recipes also abound. we were both just very disapointed. I don't generally purchase books online and this is why. Had I found it in a store, I would have looked inside and realized it was not what we would enjoy. Just another crappy gift tossed i a drawer until the summers yard sale season"
3,Nothing really great but interesting.,Theree wasn't anything I thought that was really great but a couple things I could use with the kids. If I had a choice I would have not bought it.
2,Kid Concoctions 2,Bought this book for my 8 yr. old daughter that loves the stuff made on the PBA channel. She wasn't quite as impressed w/ the book.
3,Good - but will attract insects!,"This is a fun concept for a book. However, if you live somewhere warm or plan to do these activities during the summer, many of them contain sugar or some kind of food. It screams ""ant magnet"" to me and for that reason I have not made anything except the spaghetti sculpture which never dried!"
2,Disappointed,I guess I'm not as disappointed with the book as I am w/ Amazon. I've had the book ordered for 16 weeks and it still hasn't been shipped. Great book really bad delivery. Be wary of amazon's ship dates.
5,Great Book Series!,Kid Concoctions is our children's favorite book series. The second book is even fresher and more original than the first. We hope Book #3 isn't too far ahead in the future. Keep those concoctions coming!
4,Down to Earth and believable,"Detailed, yet completely plausible outcomes.The author seems to have read Churchill's six-volume History of Second World war. As the author points out correctly, 1934 was the watershed year when Empire started losing its edge.Small changes like Besal guns, sloped armour, etc. made a big change militarily.So does political changes like defending Norway while abandoning France, shooting straight for Moscow, avoiding declaring war against USA, etc."
3,Interesting idea,"The idea is very interesting -- two historians from our time suddenly awaken in the 1930s and must decide if and how to change history. It reads more like an outline, or a discussion on an alternate history group than a novel, however. Worth reading if you are a fan of alternate history and/or world war two, mainly for the detail about the war and some serious thought into how the war could be changed given lessons from the future and the political realities of the time."
4,A Nice Little Book,"Just about perfect for a transatlantic flight. Half the fun was finding 'mistakes' (really differences of opinion with the author).'Had I written this, I would have ...' It is fun to think what would you do if you woke up seventy years in the past.Oddly, I find myself turning to this book's premise again and again. The author has done a lot of research, as well good hard-headed thinking about the scenario and comes up with some really interesting ideas.Well worth your time."
3,kinda ok 2 start (2.5-3 stars),"Lemme say that I was never much of a fan to Mitch Miller be4 like I did Percy Faith, Ray Conniff (my new 1's to start), Henry Mancini, Peter Nero, Al Hirt, among others.This sure is a good one to start even tho I'm a instant fan to him. There isn't much I had to say but all of the songs are outstanding. Recommend this if they're non-Mitch fans or ever is a fan to easy-listening, jazz and/or classical."
2,don't buy this product,"You get for what you paid for it. Everything looked cheap.As soon as it was delivered, the mouse broke, but I was able to fixed the problem. Everything else worked fine for half year until the left speaker starting to make weired noise and broke last week.So unless you are on a really tight budget, don't buy it!!!"
2,tape is defective,"I purchased the Denise Austin Trimwalk thru Amazon and it arrived promptly and appeared to be brand new and very inexpensive. However, the cassette tape is defective, would like to order another one but cannot locate the ad for it. help me. I am not asking for money back, just send me another cassette and the vcr and bill me the same price as I paid for it. MY first tape was purchased years ago and is just now starting to wear out, I really would miss not having it to listen to while I am walking. It helps me to keep moving."
1,TrimWalk:The Simple Way to Weight Loss,It was not what I thought it was going to be. I wanted a cassette to play on my recorder and not a VCR tape. I could not use this product
3,More Missing Rods,"We received our Bowflex without the rods as well. We got the machine put together as much as we could, and then realized that there were not any rods to connect to it. We were disappointed that we couldn't use it right away. I called Amazon, and they told me that there was nothing they could do, and I would have to call Bowflex to get the rods sent to me. The Bowflex Company was very helpful and sent me the rods for free. I asked them if they had this problem a lot, and they said, ""Only with Amazon."" I could tell that they are just as frustrated as we are that Amazon keeps sending these packages incomplete. As for the machine itself, it is very high quality, and I can't wait to get it put together and try it out."
5,Great home gym,"I really like this home gym, it has plenty of exercises, easy adjustments [once you get the hang of them], and really toned my muscles. I do Tae Kwon Do and Olympic style sparring and this home gym has been a great part of my normal exercise rotations.Always keep in mind though, you can exercise all you want but you also have to eat healthy for readily noticeable changes to occur. I would also suggest getting the weight bar upgrades as 210 is not quite enough to build muscle, just to tone."
2,Oh rods where art thou??,"Just received the bowflex, and just as others stated the rods seem to be missing, again the paperwork shows only one box to be delivered and there are no rods. There has to be two boxes as the rods could not possibly fit in the box with the rest of the machine. We have not put it together yet but will write another review after I contact amazon or bowflex tomorrow about the missing parts~ for now would have been 1 star because of missing parts but shipping was faster than expected so will give it 2."
4,Practical wisdom for real wives with real husbands!,"I read this book while I was in a ""crisis mode."" We were literally building our own house with our own hands. My husband and I were needing very much to be unified in our attitudes. I remember reading this book in our makeshift bathroom inside the house structure. It was the only time that I was able to be alone! This book was very helpful to me. It caused me to reevaluate my ideas about marriage. I had read so much psycho-babble, even ""Christian"" psycho-babble, that was confusing. This book cuts through to the heart of the matter. In the 90s, it is difficult to reconcile the present attitudes about women, marriage, and our role with our husbands. Mrs. Cantrell comes from a thoroughly biblical standpoint with no compromise, yet makes a very practical case of how to be the best wife one can be, even in these feminist-dominated times."
3,A miss for me,"I eagerly began reading The Names, my first Delillo novel, assuming I would be adding him to my rotation of can't-miss authors. I agree with other posters, Delillo's characters are very well developed, complicated and believable, and Delillo demonstrates true skill as a writer. Unfortunately, as a coherent story, this book was a miss for me. I consider myself a sophisticated enough reader to handle most fiction but this novel was confusing - perhaps esoteric? It was hard at times to figure out who was speaking to whom and to remember characters that were introduced earlier in the novel. I plodded through hoping to find links that would pull the story together but they eluded me. I won't rule out giving Delillo another try, however, based on my experience with The Names, I'm in no rush."
1,"A vacuous, pointless and boring book","I have to disagree with the other reviewers here; the book was vacuous, pointless and boring. There is a lot of faux-cosmopolitanism that makes one either cringe (if one takes it seriously) or lose interest (if one does not). The plot is as devoid of internal dynamism as the characters are superficial. I rarely find a book to be a complete waste of time; but this book unfortunately proved to one."
3,Great Gatsby goes to Athens,"I found The Names to be relatively intriguing. I was quite disappointed however, because the other reviews had prepared me to read something amazing. For some reason the parallel with the Great Gatsby kept coming back to me while I was reading it. Maybe because the main characters are similarly lost souls both emotionally and physically, being uprooted from the States to Greece. The plot line about the cult was a little out pf place and I do not think that it gave the reader any meaningful insight into the characters (if that was DeLillo's purpose).Don't let this discuourage you from reading the novel though--you will enjoy very realistic and true descriptions of life in Greece."
4,"Expatriate life as ultimate dislocation, a delillo favorite","Favorite Delillo themes such as cultural dislocation and the thrill ofsenseless violence are eerily embodied in a book about a divorced manliving the expatriate life who becomes obsessed with a seriesof serial killings. Delillo's flair for intelligent, witty dialogueis in full display, while he presses all the buttons the idealDelillo reader----himself, and I use the pronoun deliberately,dislocated and disturbed/obsessed with senseless violence,just like the author---to ritualistic effect. A haunting book,especially for this expatriate"
5,Roy is Right!,"Roy Moore has issued a clarion call to all Americans who cherish their religious freedom and presents the undisputable fact that we are losing those and other liberties. Unfortunately most Americans are apathetic and uninformed or ill-informed. This video is a must see and a call to action for all freedom-loving people to wake up before it is too late. America must return to her foundation in natural law because ""If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?"" Our survival depends upon it. Judge Moore concludes with the warning, ""When your liberty does not come from God it comes from man and if it comes from man they can take it from you"""
4,Play along fun,"This is a blues play along book and CD, with 13 songs. Lots of different song styles, beats, and tempos. The book includes basic notation and tab for each song, along with some scales for each song.Overall, it's fun, and worth the price.I would like to see a video version showing lead runs and rythym shapes and patterns for each song, etc..."
5,Fine quality rings,These rings are very heavy and very well made. They are perfectly round so there is no place for the eggs to stick. Just a light spray of oil keeps them stick free. They are easy to clean and strong enough not to get bent when stored in a crowded gadget drawer. The short tabs will get quite hot. I recommend picking them up with tongs. It is important to follow directions and let them get hot in the bottom of the pan before adding eggs. They are a perfect fit for english muffins and bagels.
5,Perfecting An Old Idea,"These egg rings are great! I've tried this type of thing several times in the past with poor results. The other rings I've tried aren't heavy enough and aren't level in the pan - letting the egg leak out. These rings are level and hold the egg in the ring. There was only a tiny amount of leakage with one ring when I cooked scrambled egg in them and none at all with the yolk in-tact. This is great considering the pan wasn't perfectly flat. I used them to make eggs benedict and they worked perfectly. I put them in a deep frying pan, added a little water after a couple of minutes and covered with a lid to ""poach"" the top."
4,"Great, but needs instructions.","I got these to save money and eat healthier at home, and these egg rings are great for that. They are good quality and seem very sturdy. It's easier to clean them by hand because a little egg can stick to the inside of the ring and get dried on unless you wipe it off. They're the perfect size and very sturdy.However, there are no instructions with them, and since I've never used egg rings before, it has taken some trial and error to figure out how to make the eggs without having them run out from under the ring all over the pan.I learned that if you heat up the pan and leave the egg rings on there for awhile, and heat them up, then you can pour just a dribble of egg in the bottom and it will cook immediately, sealing the tiny bit of space between the egg ring and the pan. It's also important to heat up the rings because the metal sides will cook the rest of the egg faster, reducing your chance of getting a browned bottom."
2,Threw them away,"I ended up throwing these away, I'm sorry to say. I had to run a knife around the inside of the ring to release the eggs, even after spraying with PAM; the handles were too hot to pick up with bare fingers, and too small to grip with mitts; and the circles were smaller than I'd hoped -- the egg didn't cover the muffin or bagel I was using for the sandwich. At the grocery store, I found some larger silicone rings with folding handles that work much better, similar to these:Norpro 994C Silicone Egg Pancake Ring Round, Blue. Wish I'd looked there first."
2,I had dreams that didn't quite happen with my eggs :),"These sounded perfect, I like the RSVP brand, and who doesn't like stainless? The problem is that they probably need to be a bit wider. The eggs tended to burn on the bottom by the time they finally cooked and they will leake some through the bottom edges as well. The construction quality was good but I was dissapointed with these and don't think they will be used agaib. Tried three times and unless you want runny eggs on top with burned on the bottom this isn't going to work for most."
4,Haven't used yet...,These egg rings look wonderful and feel like they are a quality product. They were a gift to my husband and he has not yet used them.
1,Never showed up.,"Item never showed up. Amazon says they shipped it, and that I got it. It was supposed to be in the same box as my new chess set. I got the chess set just fine, but no egg rings.So, here I am, playing chess and eating an egg sandwich on an english muffin with the egg all hangin out over the edges.I sure hope I don't spill grease on the chessboard, or I will have to give that a bad review as well."
3,Had such high hopes...,"Spent lots of time chopping veggies and ham and beating eggs with the intention of making many mini bagel sandwiches and freezing them. I wound up with browned eggs on the bottom (yuck) or a runny mess on the top. Had my heat on low, and only filled them halfway. These definitely need a rubber grip too, as I only had thick square potholders which aren't very flexible for gripping. Next time I'll omit adding the cooked veggies and see if the eggs can set enough to be flipped before becoming overdone on the bottom. If you like only a thin layer of egg or don't mind overcooked eggs, these would be fine. I thought of putting two thinner layers on one sandwich, but it slid apart. (Perhaps a slice of cheese could solve that). Overall the material is heavy and smooth, no seams, did not stick when sprayed with pam first, look like they'll last a long time in my utensil drawer. Good luck."
4,I like it.,"I like it, the product itself is cool. Wish it went deeper.Serves its purpose for not too much money.I would get it again if I lost the ones I have now."
4,bought 'em - like 'em,"This was my second try to find egg rings and they are very acceptable. They are made of a high quality stainless steel and have a good feel about them. There is less seepage of the egg from under the ring, especially if you ease the egg into the ring. I'm hooked on making these muffin and egg breadfast sandwiches at home. They're NOT non-stick but if you run a knife around the inside of the ring when ready to turn the eggs, the ring lifts off pretty cleanly. My biggest problem with the rings will be my weight gain."
3,Could be better,"The egg rings would work better if they were teflon coated. I have tried ""Pam' on the rings prior to ues and to no avail-eggs stick to the bottom of the ring that touches the pan surface."
4,Liked them!!,I liked the egg rings...gave two of them to my Mom...I used these often to make egg mcmuffins... easy to use and quick clean up. Dishwasher safe!
1,Very Disappointing,"We purchased the NetPack 40"" Ballistic Wheeled Duffel in late November 2003 for use on a holiday trip in late December. We had a direct, non-stop flight and put only 21 pounds of clothes in the duffel. When we picked up the duffel at baggage claim, the stitching for the main zipper had been completely ripped loose. On closer examination, the stitching had missed much of the zipper fabric which resulted it in easily being torn from ballistic/plastic edge."
2,DUH!,"Well I sadly admit I read this book, but now I get to write this review about it so YEAH!The book is mostly filled with nonsense and babble, most of which is common sense. Treat people well, and listen.... blah blah.. There are a few good points, and if you have no interpersonal skills you might want to pick this book up, or any other ""make people like you book"". My opinion is that this book won't help you get more ladies, but it may help you not repel them."
1,Ugh. Big waste of money.,"Don't be fooled by the racy cover. This book won't get you near any real women, only farther from the money you waste buying the book. Gimmicky and not written in a lucid or realistic tone. Waste of time and money."
1,Terrible Book,"Ugh, what a waste of money. A book cover is good for selling a book but then when the typeface is large and there aren't many pages, you know you're not getting any value. Better to rent a movie like ""Swingers"" or ""The Tao of Steve."""
1,Waste of Money,"Get any other book than this one (How to succeed with women - Louis, Copeland). This is 200 pages of large font and useless info you already know. I read it in 45 minutes and I'm a slow reader. It's for people who already have a large circle of friends. Yes, your friends who are girls can hook you up with their friends. Duh. The content of the book is nothing like what you would expect from the title. I'm pretty pissed actually that I paid money for this."
5,An absolute revelation,"Despite the cover and title of the book, the basic fundamental teaching here is really nothing that your gradmother or aunt wouldn't have taught you about attracting the right woman. Of course you can use that knowledge how you like, but the authors fundamentally get it right in their observation of the psychology of seduction. In fact what they say has much in common with those found in ""How to Make Friends and Influence People"" written in 1937. It's all about how to disarm and seduce people, but here applied specifically to women. However, in fact a woman could just as much benefit from some of what is written. In fact, I imagine many woman would confess that it they were subjected to the things found here, they would likely be helpless to resist - with one proviso that you have the patience, maturity and sincerity to realise the teachings, because if you are wanting the usual collection of instant quick fixes and cheesy pick-up lines here you will be deeply disappointed."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I did not relate to this material at all. The material is generic , unoriginal, and assumes you have no personality. I am not an expert on picking up girls and I could use extra skills, but this was not it. Also, I think the book makes someone try too hard to please womens anticipations. You wanna be a generic fake, follow the book!"
1,get this book if you want to be her girlfriend,"This book is a complete waste of money. ""Never make a move on a woman, listen to her complain about her boyfriend, and eventually she will ""attack"" you"" sums up the theory behind this book. This is exactly the guy I used to be and no woman ever ""attacked"" me, ever. I was the guy every woman wanted to set up with her friend but never wanted to date. If you want a one-way ticket to ""Let's just be friends""-ville, follow the advice of this book to the letter. If you actually want to date and have sex with women, you have to take the chance of getting rejected. Not fun but that's the way it is."
1,discussed .,I ordered this and there was no picture of the CD and when i received it it was just the music and NO lyrics.. I was so upset.. I called the place and they said I had to order a new one and mail it back on my own expense. Can you help me.. I still have the CD and cannot enjoy it since it has NO lyrics just music.. Not what Iwanted.Mary .I am NOT accustomed to this kind of service from you.
1,if you're looking to curl look elsewhere,"I purchased this styler because I liked the fact that it curls and straitens, though I would mostly be using it for the former. However on even the highest setting for probably longer than is advisable I could only get the most subtle wave at the bottom of my hair. It may be better as only a straitening tool, if you are looking for something to give you great curls I'd advise you to keep looking."
5,Great,I got the product (book) in a timely manner and I am very satisfied. Great to do business with this company.
3,Alaska's gift to the lower forty-eight! It's not polished but it's real. Too short though!,"A very fine collection, especiallyBarcelona. But way too short. Keepchecking her site for a new, andDVD to come out in late '06 orearly '07!"
2,Disappointed.,"Hello Jewel fans. Fact: I am a huge fan of Jewel's music, everything included, guitar, voice, imagery. I listen to Jewel to take the edge off a stressful day.Opinion: I think the makers of the DVD achieved what they set out to do, present Jewel's semi-private life to the fans.More Opinion: I was looking for pristine performances of her best songs, and I think this DVD came up way short. Don't buy this DVD if you are looking for a video version of the CD. I was, and it was a bad purchase for me. Fair Warning."
2,More **CLEAR** singing please!!,"I love Jewel, I love TV documentaries of stars and the such, but I really was wanting to listen to the songs! Everytime she is singing on this DVD it is either unclear or someone is talking over it! How frustrating. I understand that its an insight into her life, but the dvd cover even has stickers on it saying which songs are included and really sells itself as a visual copy of the cd's, which it *IS NOT*. This DVD should have been labeled more clearly as a documentary, then if I purchased it I would have been pleased instead of ripped off."
4,Worth buying,"A Life Uncommon DVD is a great DVD. It starts off with her early days and has interview with her brothers, mother, Steve Poltz and record company executives inbetween the live performances and video clips from the road. The story of her life is very well told although not as detailed as you would get in a book of course, this DVD only touches the surface but it's absolutely worth buying if you're a Jewel fan."
3,frustrated,"The piece of furniture looks nice but came unassembled. The instructions for assembly assumes that the person putting it together knows a lot about assembling furniture. No extra cam locks or screws were sent. Three of the cam locks broke while we were trying to put it together. We can't find a contact number to order extra parts. So we are trying to find parts elsewhere in time for Christmas. Also, they only allow 24 hours for you to figure out if anything is wrong or they won't take it back."
1,Coaster Cedar Chest,"The product manual was not very well written. The front piece of the product actually started to come off as it was detaching from the laminate wood. The lock was so tight that once it was locked, we could not unlock the product any longer and had to bust it open to even use it. Overall, the product looks better on the internet."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Don't waste your time ordering this chest - you will have to return it. I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my parents. When we opened the box, 2 pieces were damaged. The replacement chest was also damaged and had to be returned."
2,lost key,Well I got the hope chest and put it together. Beautiful piece. It comes with a lock and key. I left the key inside so it wouldn't get lost. Well guess what's locked inside the chest....yep the key. So here I sit with a useless piece of furniture.
1,painted bulbs,"I purchased these bulbs in both red and blue and they are a real disappointment. Instead of being made out of colored glass, they are painted - and the paint does not allow much light out, plus they get very hot. I subsequently purchased another brand of 25 watt red lights that are made out of red tinted glass that put out more and better light than these 60 watt bulbs."
3,the red starts to melt off the lightbulb,this light bulb worked good outside during the christmas season. My only complaint is when I took it down in January I noticed the red started to melt off of the light bulb. I thought it was glass not some sort of thin red coating over glass. Just be careful if you are using these outside as you may not noticed the color pealing off.
1,Gold is minimal,My wife has been wearing these for a year now. They turn her ears green. The gold plating must be very thin!
4,Interesting well put together documentary series,This three part documentary series is a find of good value for those who are wanting to be informed on mental health issues. The impact and necessary support of healthyemotional well being is shown to be a major component in our capacity to find and experience happiness.
5,I recommend my clients see this!,"I am a psychotherapist for over 25 years, and I feel this is one of the best movies showing howone can attain a fulfilling life. I highly recommend this to all!Blessings,Pat Gurnick, CLC[...]"
5,This ensightful life!,I have a new perspective on my own emotional life as a result of this documentary. I have been able to re-evaluate many of my asumptions and find contentment and peace. Daniel Gilbert's interview of Dr. Siegelman and the develpment of positive psychology gave me personal hope. He has gone beyond brain imaging research to speak in plain English of how these discoveries can make a difference in our lives.
3,A MUCH NEEDED DISCUSSION GONE WRONG....,"THIS IS A NEW EDITED VERSION OF MY COMMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR EPISODE: I THOUGHT TO REVIEW IT AGAIN....and I was delightfully surprised. This was interesting. I still feel like something is not quite right with the ideas of what is wrong and how to fix it...but the part I did like was this: It shows that when you talk to each other, really talk to each other and show respect instead of criticism then things can really shift to something 'better' even if ""better"" is not forever."
1,Well-made but a limited perspective,"Some interesting ideas and fun to hear Larry David, America Ferrara, etc. interviewed. However, the video is mostly profiles of when happiness doesn't occur. The other thing of note is that the documentary profiles LOTS of couples -- married, romantic, loving, raising children, etc. -- but it's entirely male/female couples and only talks about what ""all men want"" (women) and what ""all women want"" (men). It just seemed like it was ignoring the broader diversity of couples out there (e.g., same-sex couples) that would have made the piece more reflective of everyday life in really any community."
4,Fascinating . . .,"I thought ""This Emotional Life"" was informative, creative, thoughtful, and interesting. We are given a special look into several people's relationships, how they deal with pain, frustration, loneliness, bullying, grief. I took a drama class in college. The professor taught that emotions are our primary source of entertainment. We are fascinated and interested in emotions -- those of others and those of our own -- because our well-being depends on how well we understand and navigate the emotional mine field!"
2,"Video not playing, audio ok","For some reason the video part of the series is not playing, but the audio is ok.Anyone knowing why this is happening. I have disabled my screen saver...."
3,OK but not great,I was a little disappointed in the quality of the Backpack Picnic set. It will do for occasional use but I don't think it will stand up to the rigors of weekly on monthly use. I changed the flatware because the stuff that came with the set is very cheap. It has everything you need for a picnic in the park or to take on a road trip.
5,Great Picnic Backpack !,This is a nice backpack with everything you need. Excellent service and a quality item for the price. Highly recommend.
2,Disappointed,The backpack didn't seem to be very durable and its overall appearance looked cheap. It might be OK for personal use but I wouldn't recommend it to give as a gift. For a ten dollars more I found a much better product.
4,STARR SHINES UNDIMMED,"This album, recorded Oct-Dec 1967, was one of Kay's final albums for a major label. You'd expect the teaming of Kay with Marty Paich would have resulted in something more dynamic than this mixture of pops and standards, but the mood is unusually laid-back for this most emotive of singers. Notable exceptions are the title track and ""I can't face the day"" which show Kay at her torchy, bluesy best. Another standout track is the nostalgic, bitter-sweet Kander/Ebb ""I don't remember you"", one of a number of attractive ballads in this set.Anything by by the unmistakable and unique Miss Starr is worth a listen, and this is no exception, but it's mightily expensive and the transfer, retaining the original album's somewhat over-reverberant acoustic, is not as bright as it could be.I yield to no-one in my admiration of Kay Starr, but at (more than!) full price this wouldn't be my first choice - for sure that's the Exemplar reissue of ""Movin'!"" and ""Movin' on Broadway!"""
1,Conan it's not,"I bought this movie because part of it was filmed in South Dakota. That part was interesting to me, but overall the movie is pretty bad. If you like this style of film, stick with Conan the Barbarian."
4,Alliance Against Fascism,"This is a very good book. The essays contained in it compare the French and Spanish popular fronts. Both alliances were an attempt to answer the threat of fascism. Both alliances included the Communist Parties of the repective countries. However, the Spanish Popular Front was largely initiated by the socialist labor confederation while the French Popular Front was created by the three main political parties. Neither popular front was successful. The Frence alliance was the victim of partisan bickering and of hopes which could not be realized at that time. The Spanish alliance was destroyed by unrealistic expectations and the attempted coup by the army. The only quibble I have is that the essays are uneven in quality. On the whole, they are well-written and useful. This book is helpful in explaining the events leading up to World War II."
4,Buy this for a good laugh,"Jason really knows how to tell a story, which he does with ease. You can feel the pain and sorrow in his words and live some of the many journeys that he has taken. Many funny moments mixed with emotional ones. Thumbs up!"
3,collectable disney pixar cars,"My 3 year old son really enjoys his disney pixar die cast cars. He knows them all by name and has lots of fun playing with them. They fit on most race tracks he has and parking garage. A very cute collectable toy. My only concern is that they do chip easily and some parts are breaking off. Also, some characters are hard to find in the stores, so you have to online and pay sometimes more than double."
4,Nitroade,I received this car in a timely fashion and it was in excellent condition. My sons love playing with it.
4,kids like it,Purchased this for my son to give to his cousin for Christmas. All the boys in the family like Cars. The cars are always a big hit with the kids.
5,Great Voyager DVD's!,"I really love these dvd's. This season is the first one where voyager lands, ie, really cool effects. I also love the episode ""deadlock"", where voyager splits. Great idea! The special features are really awesome on this one. The ""day with ethan phillips"" is really cool, becuase it shows the application of his makeup. There is an awesome easter egg on this one too. It's one of Tim Russ's (Tuvok's) music videos! He sings Kushangaza (and has a nice voice might I add ;) )I would really suggest these dvd's to anyone who loves all things star trek. I'm glad I added to my collection, and will watch these for years to come!"
5,Brilliant!,"I feel this is one of the most creative and moving stories I have ever seen, inside the Trek series and outside! Done to perfection."
4,Nice for one season,This is a nice set for a single season. Consider buying the whole mega-set of all seven seasons. It's great.
4,Star Trek Voyager Season Two,Star Trek Voyager Season Two is exactly what I expected. I missed a lot of episodes when the series was on TV. It is nice to watch them when ever I want too.
4,Continuing Voyages,"The crew of the USS Voyager has been transported 70,000 light years from home and the trip back is estimated to take 70 years. They have been underway for about 6 months at the opening of the second season, when they pick up a trail of rust particles that ultimately leads them to a colony of human descended from people abducted by aliens in the 1930s. Other adventures include more encounters with the Kazon, a very distorted starship, experiments with Warp 10 and a visit from Q. Couched in a science fiction environment, many episodes featured questions and ideas that face us both when the shows originally aired and today, a decade later."
3,"Wow, ""Threshold...""","... still sucks. I saw it when it first came out and I was like ""no way!?!"" Now, I'm almost ten years older and may or may not be wiser (the fact that I bought this DVD set indicates the latter), and I am again shocked by the 220-proof ridiculousness of ""Threshold."" What an insane piece of writing! Okay, while turning people into cat-fishes is a great way to dispose of useless characters like Kes, Troi, or Wesley, it is another thing to do it, and then turn those people right back into human beings after a log entry! While the premise of the episode was certainly interesting, the ending was beyond bad.To be fair, Voyager was getting better in season 2, but it was still amateur night compare to DS9."
2,If you like Neelix then it's a 3/5,"So this one revolves around Tom Paris and Neelix resolving their differences AKA the love triangle with Kes. I'd suggest skipping it since it's just so darn predictable as to how this is going to end. Ya know it's the ol' ""everyone resolves their differences, kiss and make up, now they're best buds, etc, so on and so on"" routine. If you really like Neelix and you really like seeing Kes together with Neelix than watch it, you'll probably enjoy it.Personally I hope Kes and Tom Paris bang it out, and Neelix walks in on them and dies from a heat attack. C'mon it just makes sense people."
4,You wouldn't think this one was that good,Maybe I just like stories where people heal differences. This episode has portions that are slow but I liked it and most Trekkers will too. It is a better one overall. If Neelix is your Nemesis then give it 3 stars or less... lol.
4,Season Two...vok??,"First off, I didn't have any problems with the video file - worked fine for me.Another installment focusing on Tuvok, though this time we have an interesting twist when some alien orchids stir up his DNA with Neelix's. An interesting challenge for the actor considering how divergent Tuvok and Neelix's normal personalities are, and I think they pulled it off quite well. The identity issues facing Mr. Tuvix add an extra level of intrigue and entertainment value. I rather liked this one."
4,Pretty darn good,"First half of this episode I found not terribly intriguing and even a bit ridiculous. The latter half, however, makes up for it by introducing an intriguing moral dilemma for our lovely captain. Worth the watch, especially as it seems like we might be seeing Q again somewhere down the line..."
3,Kazon intrigue but not much else,Some new info on the Kazon and a bit of Janeway reminding everyone who's boss. Good plot stuff and probably important as far as drama in this Quadrant is concerned but definitely not worth five stars. Ended a bit too unresolved in my opinion.
3,"Mediocre at best, but not THAT bad","I agree that Voyager has seen better days (or more entertaining ones, at least), but the episode is at least entertaining in concept (transwarp threshold). Add in Tom's freakouts and the Paris/Janeway...intrigue and it might be worth the watch. Skippable if you're only in it for the gold ones but definitely not as bad as some have been making it seem. Skip it if you're squirmy."
3,star trek voyager second season 2004,it is missing 4 show that another second season show has on its cd. so don't don't order the cool packageing with the ship on the cover look for another cd with the sequel added. this cd is missing 4 shows.
5,Outstanding!!!!!,Amust own for a true Star Trek Voyager fan. The added extra special features and interviews with the cast a great and very informative.
1,Worst Episode Ever,"I would STRONGLY advise you not to watch this episode...i think it is the worst voyager episode ever. you will get very wierded out. i think it has good ideas, i mean with transwarp and all...but how Tom ends up is really weird, they could have found a better way to make that turn out. and how he takes cpt. janeway with hime through the barrier and how she ends up like him is not really a good plot turn. overall, this is a REALLY bad episode, your money would be better spent on others...such as ""The Gift"" s: 4 e:2 or ""Homestead"". s:7 3rd to last episode."
3,"Viewable now, mild as a personification of fear","FYI. I watched this episode on my computer, and it ran just fine. Okay, on with the review.Fear personified? This one was more annoying than scary...it's strangely less annoying than when the show was first run. You still don't want to be around this dude the clown though.And unlike some stories, fear is actually defeated, which I think is the only reason to watch this one, is to see how Janeway does just that."
1,"Skip this one, just skip it.","It's a Ferengi episode, but these Ferengi have no redeeming qualities like Quark has on DS9. For a change I wanted to hear strong language on the bridge. ""Those *!@% greedy Ferengi, beeeeep beeeep beeeeep beeeeep!""I wish I had skipped it myself."
3,Packaging problems and other woes,There was at least one scuffed disk in the set . Amazon.com was nice about extending me courtesies for a while but won't believe their packaging people could be this incompetant and so blacklisted me so I can't order from them anymore. I had to sign in under another account to write other similar reviews. All this trouble for a less than stellar season of Voyager. It would have been fine if they had an episode where the Captain lets someone kill himself and Torres commits murder against a sentient robot she created.
2,As disappointing as the first season,"I was 13 episodes into this collection before I found one worth watching for more than a few minutes, and even that one was pretty hokey. Unless you can't get enough of unimaginative plots and sparse special effects, move on to the fourth season."
2,ridiculous,"I know Star Trek is generally pretty unscientific, but come on... this is just silly. Everyone knows there is nothing predetermined in evolution."
3,Really a 3.5 star rating,"Overall I could have done without seeing this one. It's was interesting to see San Fransisco ala 4901 and it was interesting to see an ""alternate"" reality for Kim, but there just wasn't enough in this episode for me to give it a glowing recommendation. I think the actor playing Kim does an adequate job, if you love the Kim character this one will be more like a 4 star rating for you."
4,Do you like the next generation?,"I don't write reviews but this episode has no ratings so I feel I must. I was a big fan of star trek the next generation and the ones that featured 'q' were always some of the best. Without spoiling anything I just want to say that if you did as well, you will probably be very glad you saw this episode, as I was."
4,One of the better Voyager seasons,"Many of the episodes in season 2 are unique and it does not get boring in this season. There are one or two sub-par episodes, but overall season two is one of the better seasons of Star Trek Voyager."
1,Vger is horrible,"Now I am not going to tell you what to watch, but honestly people, Vger was a boring, predictable series. Season two had about 5 episodes that would be considered ""adequate"" episodes for TNG or DS9. The characters had no zest or appeal, aside from B'Leanna and Janeway (who lost credibility when she could do just about everything, from run a starship to knitting a blanket for the baby.) The only episode of the second season that had any real drama was Deadlock. (I have to admit, I liked the Viideans.) Deathwish was a good one too.If you have money to waste, by all means, by this and every other season of Vger. But if you have a choice, spend your money on TNG, DS9, Babylon 5, or maybe even a nice weekend trip to a not so far away town."
5,Long awaited and well worth it.,"Voyager was a new direction for Star Trek- away from the Federation, with none of the usual aliens, and without the possibility of help from home. That makes for some very interesting plot developments.Some of the best examples of which are in the second season. Most of the episodes of this season were great, and particularly noteworthy mention are ""The Thaw"", ""Tuvix"", ""Cold Fire"", ""Threshold"", ""Non Sequitur"", and of course the season finale ""Basics,p.I"".If you're already a voyager fan, you know what I'm talking about. If not, I think you'll be one after seeing a few episodes. I highly recommend the second season to help get you addicted!"
3,I'm sensing a pattern in Season 2,"The definition of an ""OKAY"" episode. I found the robot design quite boring and generic, as well as their back story. The prime directive plays center stage here when B'Elanna has to decide whether or not to interfere in the near extinction of a race of artificial life forms. To be honest it just wasn't enthralling or interesting like season 1's episodes have been.I can't possibly see how anyone could give this a 5/5...that means flawless, and this one was far from it.p.s. Another factor that might have crippled my enjoyment is my knowledge of how this is all put together. For Example: I know that the robots terrible design was a product of LOW budget (a human inside of a jumpsuit with a mask) This is indicative of all Star Trek's robots....they all look VERY human because they don't have the budget to make automatons or really interesting non humanoid robots. It's a shame, but I understand the constraints."
3,Mixed feelings on this Episode,"This is no doubt an important episode, and the ending is pretty surprising. All that said if I ever watch this series again I'll probably skip this one. I felt it could have been much better in direction and writing, there was just something missing for me.It might be the over usage of Star Trek technobabble?...the all too common ""adjust shield harmonics"" or ""defensive maneuver delta 4"" or ""modulate the dampening frequency""...I can only take so much before it all starts sounding EXACTLY the same in every scenario. I might need to go back and watch TNG, but I don't remember having that feeling while watching that series.I still recommend you watch this one even if it is a bit slow and repetitive, it's important to the series over-arcing story."
5,Best Trek series!,"Love the Voyager series, really fantastic. My favorite ""Trek""! Recommended. Seven GREAT seasons! Hard to find nowadays at a decent price."
5,I'm SOOOO Satisfied!!!,One of the most AMAZING of the Star Trek franchise! Do you have doubts??? Start at ther beginning and they will all go away! Solid entertainment. Hilarious as well. CHECK IT OUT!!!!~Peter
4,New World that's Well Done (& we never see again),"This is one of the best produced episodes of Season 2. My compliments to the designers, prop, make-up, and costume crews. It looked fantastic for a TV Show. It's also a heartfelt story that is good Trek entertainment. I did find it a little long winded at points, but overall I must say it's a good stand-alone Janeway episode. 4.4/5.0 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,Mamma Neelix and Pappa Paris,"Ok, there's been a side plot on Voyager since the show began. Neelix has been extremely jealous of Tom Paris over his girl. It has been a side plot that has gotten out of control, so they devote a whole episode to resolve it. Sure there's another alien, and alien planet, but we get lost in the over-drama of this whole relationship. And it could have been a good alien story, but was ruined. Frankly I'm gonna skip this episode the next time I see it. Not well done. Needed something more to keep me from playing Angry birds on another screen. 2.3/5.0 Stars. Just cause I gave this a very low score doesn't mean I don't love the Trek. It just means I was really bored. I love the work of Jonathan Frakes, but this is one of his flops (sorry). ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,"Sweethearts of the Rodeo/One Time, One Night","Basically bought it for the song ""Midnight Girl/Sunset Town"". Has some other good song, but would have rather just been able to download the one song."
3,A hagiography of a movement,"A strange book. As a project of relating the ideas of Egyptian ""New Islamists"" as they would like themselves presented, the book does a very good job. But on the other hand, it is completely uncritical, and provides very little of the context for the positions described. Baker's unrelenting praise of the New Islamists gets wearying after a while, especially as most often the ""New Islamist"" positions are little more than warmed-over Islamic modernism, internal tensions and superficialities included. Perhaps the New Islamists are a welcome contrast to the more mindless, violent variety of Egyptian Islamist more familiar from the media. It is, however, too much of a stretch to portray these garden variety of cultural conservatives part of an intellectually sophisticated movement with liberal attitudes."
3,Harpo Rarities,"Harpo Marx's Mercury recordings were out of print for many years. This CD delivers value for money by including both albums: ""Harpo in Hi-Fi"" (1957) and ""Harpo at Work"" (1958). Surprisingly, the world's most famous harpist does not record as a soloist; instead, Harpo collaborates with jazz and classical musicians, resulting in an added dimension to his overall sound. Several tracks suffer from overproduction, but ""Laura,"" ""Imagination"" and Harpo's composition of ""Guardian Angel"" are beautifully done - quite a contrast from his musical performances on film and television. Definitely worth a listen."
5,Harpo is the Jimi Hendrix of harp,Buy this to hear Guardian Angel without the added lyrics that kill the song
3,Shhhhhhhhhh!,"This CD combines two Harpo Marx albums from 1957/58 on one CD. Harpo, of course, was the most famous harpist of all time. Some of the tracks here have a somewhat jazzy feel to them, but some of them are a little too close to ""easy listening"". Harpo fans should enjoy it, though."
4,Incredible!--and would've been better,"As a great fan of Harpo Marx, after whom I named my e-mail address, this CD is really a gem for its collection of beautiful and rare tunes played (and some of them are composed) by Harpo himself. The album would have been even much better, though, if he had played some quick-tempo tunes for the album, just like he did in a few of the Marx Brothers films, such as in Go West or A Night in Casablanca. A must for not only fans of the Marx Brothers but also all music lovers!"
4,Vintage Progressive Metal,"You'll enjoy this album a lot more if you can tolerate Jonas Hanssons vocals. Fortunately, the technical expertise of the entire band makes that easy to do. Hansson's comlpex, lightining quick riffs are refreshingly original. Anders Johansson is equally talented on the drums and his brother Jens is absolutely awesome on the keyboard, constantly fluttering on the keys ala Rick Wakeman. Bassist Per Stadin maintains a bouncy punctual beat. If you liked Deep Purple, their influence on this band is evident throughout the album."
5,Transcendant Visionary Music: beyond the beyond,"This music is unique and certainly difficult to describe with words. But I'll give it a go: With his Bazantar, Mark masterfully creates sound and timbre that entwine the exquisite aural resonance with cryptic mystical conjurings, beckoning the mind to relax and open and explore a transcendant tapestry of emotive texture and visionary trance."
5,Fundamental reading,"Each chapter in this books provides solid information that will encourage the teaching profession to adopt practices conducive to the betterment of learning as well as teaching itself. The contributions based on research most certainly reinforce the idea that it is time policies, schools, teachers, parents and students contemplated assessment, for learning in particular, as a practice that facilitates the development of sound learning and the possibility of success to all learners."
1,Bait and switch,I noticed while looking at a different item that this and other pieces offered by this seller in the product's name advertise that the piece is Zircon... It is not! It is Cubic Zirconia!CZ (cubic zirconia) is a man made diamond simulant. Zircon is a natural stone. They are not the same.It is against the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines for the jewelry industry to sell a simulant as any natural stone or under the name of a different stone.[...]Zircon is the mineral zirconium silicate ZrSiO4I can't tell you if the CZ or the setting are any good but I can tell you I don't trust a seller that repeatedly uses false advertisement.
2,Turn of the Screw Review,This book was very hard to follow in the beginning. As it progresses it becomes more interesting. The outcome is the best part of the book. It's conclusion is not what you would think to happen. It has a very good ending.
4,Quick dry,For all of those who seem to have to re-caulk often but hate the 24 hour dry time. This product truly dries quickly. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be completely mold resistant. Better than the usual stuff in my local hardware store.
3,"Good, but you still need another study guide","I really want to say that this is a good book for you to learn Remote Access for the CCNP exam. However, it is not the book that you use to prepare for the CCNP exam. I prefer Cisco Press or Sybex.Good(1): I liked the fact that the user setup a scenario and walk the readers through each chapters. I easy to understand and fun to read the book.Good(2): The author has included a lot of information that is good to know, even if it's not covered on the exam, but as a professional, you should know about it.Bad(1): No CD or practice exam come with the book.Bad(2): The questions seems to be easier than the one on the exams.Bad(3): So many errors and typos, but if you can catch it, that means you understand the stuff.I would like to keep this book as a reference, becasue I like the author's presentation style.I would also recommend you to spend an hour in the local bookstore and read a chapter before you buy."
1,Don't bother,"Book is out of date, filled with typos and inaccurate information. It appears as if it was written in a hurry.Questions are rather subjective and not the same as the test."
3,ehh...,"I've always had a thing about buying 3rd party controllers. I've always felt that since all of the thought went into the design, it would feel great. And this one feels great! However, it is massive! It covers the console if you set it on top. It has a more natural hand placement (it is like those keyboards with the separated keys) and has a couple groves for your fingers, but the fingers don't fall into them, at least mine. The rubber grips on the sides and on the stick give a feel of greater control than the sega one, but the rubber on the D-pad mades sliding difficult. The slots are a bit sticky, and the VMU is kinda hard to get out. the buttons only go down when pushed directly down, and are also covered in rubber. The triggers don't have the range of movement as the sega one, and feel different (it's hard to describe)Verdict: A cheap(er) alternative the sega controller made by a well known game accessory maker, however, as many people on the site have said, sega makes the best."
1,More garbage from Mad Catz,I made the mistake of purchasing two of these controllers. It took me several tries to get them to initialize with the Dreamcast. Many times I'd attempt to move my game character up only to see him moving left. I returned both of them the next day. The salesman said he'd seen these controllers returned more than any other in the last 2 years. He told me that most of the other Mad Catz junk that the store attempted to sell usually got returned as well. The original Sega controllers are far superior in every sense of the word. AVOID this controller!
2,It falls Apart,"After about six months all the rubber fell off, the truggers dont work properly and the buttons stick!!!!"
1,don't buy this!,"i bought 2 of these to play marvel versus capcom and i haven't even opened the second one,(I,M TRYNG TO SELL THEM...) the program function is useless the directional pad isn't accurate when you try to go foward you jump and so on anyway don't buy this the standard pads cost more for a reason"
1,I would have given this 0 stars if I could.,"This controler stinks. The joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle (so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up), the rubber grips fall off in the first week, and worst of all, it's confusing. I tried programing the buttons (because it's ""fully programable"") and believe it or not it works! sure you can't train whole sets of commands (like moves in fighting games) in, only replot the buttons but it works. The only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden, none of the buttons perform the X action. Then, this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine. Enjoy!:("
4,it works fine,the only reson i got this controller becuse it was the only ones they got and I don't want to wait to go out of town to get a fist party I don't like how it feels pushing both triggers down and hard to remove the vmu other than that it fine but I worried it will brake in like 2 to 3 years time.LIke my firends the had mad catz controler for play station they said it us mess up after a few weeks with the lights .But hoppfuly this will last mush long senic the it has progarm abliy they had to use better parts the psx mad catz controller do not summerised in one intergated chup like the fist parties do .If can get a fist party controller get it they last for very time .
3,The Two Mad Catz Dream Pads,"As one reviewer has stated, there are two versions of the Mad Catz Dream Pad -- one great, one not so great. The not so great one only comes in white. The great one comes in a variety of colors. With the former, the directional pad is much too stiff and unresponsive, making it impossible to consistantly perfom special moves in fighter games. The second version is as commendable as the controllers for the Sega Saturn. My advice, if you are going to get a Mad Catz Controller, the safest thing to do is to make sure it is not a white one."
4,One fatal flaw,Awesome controller with one fatal flaw: When I use the controller I have to unplug it and re plug it in every time i change games or turn the console on
3,This book brings together four of the greatest comedies .,i yet have to read the book completely. hence it may not be possible to give valid dependable comments.
3,Pageant Shoes,"I bought these shoes to compete in a Mrs. California Intl Pageant. While they are INSANELY uncomfortable if you are not used to walking/standing in high heels for hours, they were EXCELLENT competition shoes!!! No sense in spending hundreds of dollars on pageant grade shoes. Especially if you are a woman of color and the ""taupe"" color doesn't cut it for you.These are great! I wish I could stand to be in them for hours because they are beautiful, sexy and obviously, they work with any portion of the competion, from swimsuit to evening gown. Yes, they are uncomfortable. I would have given them 4 stars except for one other tiny thing: at the buckle, there are flesh colored (not *my* flesh color, mind you) findings which show up on stage against dark skin. It would have been nice if the entire shoe were crystal clear.Seriously though, if you are competing andl ooking for shoes, they really are great. Try 'em. You won't be disappointed."
3,Okay if you're only wearing them for a short time.,"I ordered these a size up from my normal shoe and they still ended up being a bit narrow, however, I didn't bother exchanging them for a bigger size because the buckled strap part was very loose even though I had it the tightest it could go. They weren't terribly uncomfortable when I tried them on, but honesty I don't think I could go for more than an hour or two in these shoes (Thankfully, I wasn't planning on it, so I'm keeping them.)Overall, it seems like very nice quality (definitely not cheap), the sizing is just kind of wonky. If you have (even a little) wide feet like me, just order a size up, and grin and bear it. Maybe after a couple wears the plastic top will give way, but that is by far the tightest part of the whole shoe (save from the overall narrowness). The only reason you shouldn't order a size up is if you have narrow teensy feet--lucky you."
3,Okay,"Heel is too short for a pageant. Nice shoe but not for the purpose. Crystal shoe is nice but again, the heel really isnt high enough for the pageant world"
3,"Has a couple of good moments, but not a truly great artistic achievement","Not one of the more talented groups to mix genres on the same album, much of this album is a messy hodgepodge of what sounds like a bunch of demos that the group wasn't sure what to do with. However, the smooth jazz instrumental ""Friends In Philadelphia"" is quite good.Note: Despite the absence of an Amazon product page for it, this album is available as a CD. The number of existing copies is highly questionable, but I have seen at least 2."
1,Not 500 watts!,"I wanted to share this with others who may order this for the 500watts of power - it is only 320 watts! I burned out a 250w blender recently, and ordered this thinking it was double power. It wasn't much heavier when I removed it from the box, so I looked at the motor, and it said 320w. Evidently the 500w was the power of the european/220v motor, even though the outside of the box says plain as can be ""500w"".Needless to say, I returned it. I can't really rate it, just say it isn't what it says it is."
2,a weak blender,"The first unit I recevied did not work at all. The vendor sent me another, and I find that even if you hold the button, the unit works intermittently. Holding in the ""burt"" button does work, but I have to wonder if that might burn out the motor. It feels heavy, and regardless of the picture, the top is not flat, so you cannot rest the unit with the blade side up. This replaced a 15 year old $15 Rival which was an all-around better unit right up until its death."
2,Sent it back,"After a minute of use, this unit was hot to the touch. You would think that 500 watts of power would last longer than that! I sent it back and Amazon has a great return policy. I was able to purchase a different unit quickly."
2,so so...,Buttons are hard to press and hold. Blender having problems after serveralmonths of light use. Try to return for repair.
1,shaft mechanics not stainless; gets stuck with rust,"The last time I used (half a year ago or so), the shaft was stored vertically after washing, and some water got stuck inside. When I took it out yesterday, brown/black water came out, soiling my pants, and the axis was completely stuck. Apparently, the stick part is not really made from stainless steel, and not letting it dry completely before storing will wreck it."
2,dualit 88860 500-watt,"the Dualit 88860 500-watt Immersion Hand Blender with pulse, did not work for more than two weeks it is in the junk pile right now, I think I did not have a good experience with it not very happy about it."
5,"Dualit ""does it""","I was looking for a powerful hand blender that wasn't all plastic. I wanted a heavy duty mixer that could handle what ever frozen fruit or ice I threw in my health shakes. This is truly heavy duty and easy to clean. It also provides a ""turbo"" setting that I haven't had to use. Glad I bought it!"
2,Hard to put on the camera with eyepiece.,The item was a problem to put on the Nikon D2X with an extended eyepiece. I had to do some cutting on the plastic and it was cumbersome to use in the field. I ended up taking it off and using a normal LCD screen protector.
2,Full-sized eeBoo cards are excellent; the tiny ones are useless,"I found a deck of eeBoo cards at a local secondhand shop and the whole family LOVED them. I thought I'd get a set of other card games from the same manufacturer. Unfortunately, when the set arrived, the cards were TINY! My 4 and 5 year olds both had trouble holding them (heck, so did mom and I!), but thankfully returning them was a breeze. These cards are beautifully illustrated and very durable, but the dimensions are not accurate on the amazon page for this and the ""volume 2"" sets."
2,Size is an issue,The card are undersized I ended up at Target to make sure to get the size that would work with small hands.
4,saving tires,"After having a fairly new tire wear down found that the the strut was busted rather than the front end being out of alignment. Replace the strut, vehicle handling has improved."
2,"I like it, my birds do not","It is nice and sturdy and I have not had an issue putting the suet cakes in there, but my birds will not go near it. Like the other reviewer, I think it is a combination of not only the shining tin top, but also it is hard for them to get on them. Back to the plastic one."
2,The birds didn't like it!,"I put this suet feeder next to a regular green cage suet feeder I had and the birds chose the green one every time. Even after the suet in the green one was gone, they didn't seem to want to come to this feeder.I think the problem was with the roof - 1) it is very shiny and might frighten birds away and 2) it's very slick and the birds aren't able to land on the roof and then move to the side where the food is. Most of the birds seemed to have a lot of trouble landing on the cage portion of the feeder.The reason I bought this one was I liked the little glass beads that hooked to the bottom and even those were missing from my package. I was disappointed in this feeder. I threw it out and bought another no-frills green cage."
3,Not too bad,"In winter, so many wild creatures came to the suet feeders, that we decided to add two more to our existing two. The two we had were the simple wooden once. They are cheap and inconspicuous, but squirrels have quickly damaged the bottom part. Therefore, we decided to get the metal once, and somewhat more fancy. ""Artline Deluxe Metal Suet Cage Feeder"" looked nice on the screen, was reasonably priced, and we bought two of them. We have been using them continuously for about 6 weeks. Pros: sturdy cage, strong hanging wire; very easy to wash; and the sun catcher is easily detachable . Cons: (1) too small! I had to cut the plastic sides of the suet cakes to fit them in; (2) a flimsy plastic lock, holding the roof, is no match for the squirrels. We had to hang feeders from thin branches to prevent squirrels from devouring the entire cake in a few hours. Of course, this kind of positioning has prevented bigger birds like woodpeckers above 8"", starlings, or gray jays to eat it too."
4,Good quality,Good quality feeder. One problem with it is that the suet cake sticks at the top and doesn't slide down as the birds nibble away at the bottom half.
2,poor customer communication,I ordered a schwinn cycling bike for a Christmas gift 12/02/2011. I have emailed them 2 times no communication back regarding the ship date. when I called the number on amazon website it goes to an generic voice mail no indication what company you are calling. I have not received the bike yet but I'm not happy with the customer service. I'll keep you postedSchwinn IC Evolution Indoor Cycling Bike
3,Disappointment,"This album was previously ""cut"" on Decca after she hadcut three outstanding albums on the Capitol label. Withouta doubt the latter are true treasures, this one is not.Various arrangements with different bands make this arelative ""hodge podge"" of music that doesn't have the""bounce"" and the consistent blend of artistry found onthe other label. Unfortunately, the dolts at Capitolnever re-issued the three albums on c.d."
4,Fine until it stops,I am not sure what the typical life span of this product is. I bought my first one in 2007. It worked beautifully until it stopped October 2011. I replaced it and it's presently doing it's job just fine.
4,Sharp and On-Target,"I have read and read again this poignant collection of short stories - each time laughing a little, crying a bit and always reflecting on how Ortleb's satirical voice should make us all stop and think about the society in which we live. The stories are full of witty one-liners which you remember long after the book is finished - and Ortleb has managed to spin a cast of charaters who are so familiar that you stop to wonder if he knows the same people you do. Underneath it all is a not-so-subtle wake up call to end the ridiculous attitudes our society has about being gay or living with AIDS. This is a book you will read more than once and is a ""must"" for anyone touched by the horror of AIDS. It is sure to become a benchmark in the search for truth and an eye-opener about a disease we thought we understood."
3,Dof Run,"Good value, item works well. I needed one 63 feet long and everybody else will supply 50 or 100 feet. This one was perfect for my needs."
2,Not very inspiring,"I got this as a gift for a new military wife. I have been an Army wife for 15 years and was excited to page through it before giving it. I was disappointed. The publishing is second rate (it looks like a do-it-yourself job)and quite frankly, wasn't all that encouraging. I found it trite and rather boring and didn't end up giving it as a gift after all."
5,A true classic cartoon,This is a WONDERFUL full length cartoon with all your favorite WB characters! I remember watching this movie over and over a a little kid. I'm so glad I could find it!!!
1,Doesn't work,"We recently adopted an older chihuahua mix who has icky tear stains. This product didn't remove ANYTHING, even when the stains were clearly fresh. I tried using cotton balls and Q-tips soaked in the product with the same result. I am planning on returning it."
4,Great for Persian Cats,"I am suprised to see this many bad reviews. I have been using this on my Persian Cats for years now. It does not work for deep cleaning - a bath is required for that. However it cleans and prevents staining and buildup for daily use. Also works great as a stain removal pre treatment before bath time. Its not a miracle tear stain bleach, but keeps clean until you can make it till bath time, which then makes stains easier to come clean during bath. I recommend it to everyone!"
1,Does not work,"Bought this to use on my Pomeranian with cream colored fur. Her tear stains aren't too bad most of the time, but there is some slight discoloration that happens over time. I bought this with hopes to keep it cleaner. After several applications there was no difference in the appearance of tear stains.I don't know if this would work better with already clean eyes to help keep them clean, but this product clearly does not work from already stained fur around the eyes, so I would not recommend it."
1,Really a quite worthless product...,This product does nothing. Period. Waste of money to buy it and waste of time to use it !! Wish I could rate as zero stars !!
1,Doesn't Work,"Our little Bichon began developing tear stains. Rather than allowing the stains to get worse, I thought I'd nip them in the bud and quickly purchased a bottle of Gold Medal Tear Stain remover. I paid around ten bucks and enthusiasticaly applied the product per the directions. In just a few short days, the stains were 10 times worse. This product doesn't work. Save your money!Gold Medal Tear Stain Remover"
1,Just Does Not Work...,"I have been using this in large amounts on a cotton pad every couple days - it literally does nothing for her, even when ""scrubbing"" the stains. I am returning it tomorrow and asking the vet what to do since her stains are pretty bad."
4,Reconstructing the career of a silent-screen vamp,"Very few of Theda Bara's films survive, but author Golden has done an admirable job in reconstructing her career and wading through the large amount of press-agent puffery about Miss Bara. There are many never-before seen pictures of Ms. Bara's films. A great introduction to one of the silent film era's biggest movie stars."
4,Madrox Comes Out Strong,"This album was a lot better then I actually expected it to be. I was dissapointed with Twiztid's last two albums. Don't get me wrong I love Psychopathic and will keep on buying every CD that they put out. I thought Freakshow was a masterpiece. The best tracks on this cd are Hey Phatty, Keep On, and Tear Jerker. I guess the biggest problem that I have with this CD is the music. I was never a big fan of Fritz the Cat who produces a lot on this album. As far as the lyrics go Jamie Madrox delivers. Overall I think this album is worth getting especially if you like any of Twiztid's albums."
1,ARRRRRGGGHHHHHH MY EARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Isn't James Taylor mostly acoustic anyway? The sound samples say it all. Orchestral might have been better, like the Boston Symphony or something, but this is poison for everyone who thinks James Taylor is easy listening. Which he ain't, but this is, which is why it doesn't work."
2,READ THE FINE PRINT,"If you click on the jpg above so it zooms in, you'll see that it says ""Acoustic Tribute to James Taylor."" Well, if that's your thing..."
1,Painfully Boring,"It would have been better if there were vocals on this album, but it's just boring elevator music instead. I almost liked ""Fire and Rain,"" but the prominance of the banjo ruined it."
4,Paper wheels work very well,"I sharpen, by machine, often and the paper wheels are the best, most consistent in quality. These are great tools to use for edges that cut!"
3,"I'll second the review: ""While it lasts!""","This would have been our third winter with this humidifier, and for the price it should have lasted MUCH LONGER. After much cleaning and oiling throughout last winter, I think I staved off the inevitable motor seize, but alas, we got it out of it's tote this morning and the fan axle is rusty and locked. I am MOST unhappy about this, as I had already purchased a few extra boxes of replacement filters. I will not be buying another of these models in order to use up the filters, that's for sure. Be wary!!!"
5,Good as it gets,You get what you pay for. I paid a lot but got a quality item in return. It's all good.
2,...,"Arrived in perfect condition. Wasnt the right sized chip, that was my fault i orderedd the wrong size."
4,"Not bad, not good, kinda middle of the road..","Okay, first off I like this CD, HOWEVER as the other reviews have mentioned, it defenitely is not as good as the first CORONA CD release, the producers seemed to go for a different style vs the first CD's non stop euro dance beats. I would have to agree the the first three songs as well as I BELONG TO YOU {80s} are the CORONA that us dance fans love, fun upbeat great dancing even today they don't sound dated. The other songs while not bad seem to kind of just be there to be there no effort on the producers or singers parts for that matter almost like they said let's have three or four great songs and lots of filler.If you are a collector of dance music and can find this CD for a good price under 10 bucks grab it for the the four mentioned songs they really are that good."
2,Not very good :(,"I loved ""The Rhythm Of The Night"", but this one was not good. There are not very many dance tracks here : only 5 or 6. I liked ""Walking On Music"", ""Magic Touch"" and ""The Power Of Love"", so that's why I put 2 stars. But the rest of the album is not very good : ""Lift Me Up"" and ""I Belong To You"" are not really bad but the other tracks are NOT GOOD AT ALL. So I don't recommend it to you. If you really want to know what it sounds like, listen tracks 4 and 5. That's all I can say, too bad a great album is followed by a bad album :("
4,"""Walking On Music"" is good to walk & dance to.","This is a good second effort. Most of the material is slightly above average. Her vocals a nice to very good. Except for a few stinkers of the second half of the cd, it is generally good & worth the money for any Eurodance fan."
4,walking on music,This album was never treated to a U.K release even though the first album did okay over here.Corona had 5 hits in the U.K1994-The Rhythm Of The Night (NO.2)1995-Baby Baby (NO.5)1995-Try Me Out (NO.6)1995-I Dont Wanna Be A Star (NO.22)1997-Megamix (NO.36)1995-ALBUM The Rhythm Of The Night (NO.18)So i was always surprised that this was not released here or any singles as Walking On Music and The Power Of Love would have been big club hits and probably would have done well in the charts at the time.alot of the album is a bit ballady which doesnt suit it very well although the songs arent bad.Shame they no longer record under the Corona name and if you say Corona to most people they think you mean the beer lol
5,Practical Guide,"This is not a science book, it's a guide to practical application of science in space (weather) operations. If you are interested in the impacts of space weather on systems or operations, then this book provides a great introduction. It was a required text in an introductory space weather class in grad school. Today it's indispensable as a reference for space weather operations. The first chapter is useful, though the rest of the text can stand on its own without it. If you need more in-depth information, it's available elsewhere."
4,Excellent introduction to space,"I used this book as a student in a graduate-level class on the space environment. Although the book is a bit dated, and many of the figures have been lifted from some aesthetically-displeasing original sources, I continually find myself referring to it when questions arise in my research. And its price can't be beat."
1,Terrible Design Flaw,"After reading all the reviews I was hyped about getting this. I even got the later shipments without the squeaky wheel problem. Well all I can say is that this thing suffers from 1 major flaw. The way the unit has to be positioned in order to get a grip is really restrictive because you are unable to adjust the wheels height or tilt. The wheel has to be at the same level as your stomach and at your knees. If you try and position it closer you will be unable to turn the wheel because it will hit your, uh you know what. BAD! The only saving grace is the pedals which are quite comfortable otherwise it would have gotten 0 stars if that were possible. I returned it to the store immediately within 20 minutes of getting it. Do not buy!"
1,NOT what it seems,"This video, although fast-paced and energizing, does not teach the dance steps in a format that anyone who has ever taken a real dance class is used to. The instuctor ignores whether he's saying left or right foot (which is irritating) and the focus is more on the dancers showing off than actually teaching the steps. No counts for the moves are given and the build of the routines is awkward. Too much trouble for anyone with anything else to do!"
2,hip hop body shop,"although the dance moves in this were good, i found it kindof hard to follow and never finished it because it was too hard to follow the moves. i also didnt like it because the people are from the eighties or something and the music wasnt energizing."
1,Hip Hop CRAP shop!,"I am a teacher of personal fitness and tae-bo. I gave this video to my students to watch, and it was the worst video I have ever seen! I can do better moves than this while I crap. Why is it all black people and one mexican girl? Where's all of the Native Americans? And i think the mitlitary move is highly ineffective. What soldier would use this in a drill!?! I can't believe I spent two dollars on this."
2,Between begginer and serious but lost the focus,"In my opinion this is a book built arround a very good example of an application, but not a book to start with nor a book for the experts.The introduction goes fast jumping from subject to subject without showing a clear direction to teach you either logic, approach, language, conventions or how to better understand the environment (developing environment)The fact of talking about visual basic makes me think instantly that there will be a smooth transition till you are up to speed and then jump to more complex examples, in this book it is a collection of picks and tricks in a messy way in order to prepare you without too much explanation so they can explain ""real"" application written in VB.Funnily the application itself is very informative and useful but by the time you arrive there there are too many questions running wild on your head and is quite fustrating."
1,Not worth the money!,"The ring came misshapen, the color rubbed off to reveal an ugly orange color beneath. It turned my finger green. The two rings didn't really fit together well either."
4,Quesadillas all around,"I won this product in a raffle - I didn't really want it. But I have to say that this is a hoot! I enjoy making Quesadillas for my kids now that they are on vacation from school. I have used a few of the recipes from the book, and made a few of my own. How about a Calzone Quesadilla? My husband loved it!!! Think of it as a new way to make a grilled cheese, except that you would be using tortillas."
2,Unimpressed,"I usually make my quesadillas on my griddle and just flip then half way through. It seemed to take forever so I thought a quesadilla maker would be the perfect solution. Needless to say, I'm unimpressed. The cheese oozed out the sides and all of the ingredients pushed out towards the edges leaving the center basically empty. We prefer a bit of a crispy tortilla and this leaves them soft and flimsy. While it's definitely convenient and faster than making it on the stove, I'll be returning this and going back to the more time consuming method."
3,Be careful!!,"We thought this was a pretty good quesadilla maker, until my husband snapped the chili pepper handle right off the lid."
2,El Paso Quesadilla,This item does not make very good quesadillas. They are very dry and crunchy. My kids tried them and now prefer that I make them in the skillet like I used to do before purchasing it for them for Christmas. I threw away the box so therefore I can not return it and am basically wasting cabinet space storing it since no'one wants a quesadilla made with this maker. Guess it will be a future garage sale item..
3,Gift Purchase,"Have not used product - purchased for gift. However, vendor purchased from was super and item appears to be exactly what I was looking for in this gift."
2,El Paso Quesadilla Maker,"It works well, but it is not easy to clean. The non-stick surface wipes clean easily, but this is not the problem. The problem is that food and juices from cooking go in a crack between the cooking surface and the housing of the unit. The other night, I decided that I would take the unit apart to try to clean it. It was very dirty inside. I decided that I would try the Salto Santa Fe Quesadilla Maker and it is made the same way. The problem with both units is that whatever runs in the drip tray starts cooking before it can get in the resevoir, resulting in an overflow into the cracks where it cant be cleaned without disassembling the whole unit."
4,Good for quesadillas & sandwiches,"I received this item from my sister because she used it on rare occasions. I am not an avid maker of quesadillas, however me and my boyfriend are very fond of pressed sandwiches and this pretty much does the trick. So far I've heated & pressed chicken parm, media noches, and grilled cheeses. It also creates equal lines on the sandwiches which make them easily cuttable. While it may not be a panini press, it is definitely useful and I am very happy with this product!"
1,Save your money...,"I received this quesadilla for my birthday in March & have used it aprox half a dozen times.The quality of this unit is very poor. The pretty front ""Chili"" handle on mine broke off while we were using it, rendering it useless.I would NOT recommend this product."
4,Good for what its worth!,This is an awesome portable machine. at least I don't have to wash any dishes after i make my kids the quesadilla.
1,Poor Quality Construction,"The maker functions about as well as you'd expect (i.e., less predictable than making a quesadilla in a pan, but perfectly good for casual use). However, the parts are quite flimsy. The drip tray doesn't stay put, and the cute chili handle is held on by chintzy plastic. It broke off after only a few uses. I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,used only once but good so far,"We got this after a 25 free gift card so thought why not get something we would never buy with our own money! Turned out to be a nice little gift. We've only used it once but we loved how it made the Quesadillas....they tasted great. It really made the exterior part taste delicious and that's what made our kids like it too! We can't speak for the durability because we've only used it once but it looks like it might hold up for repeated uses. If you have the chance to get one on sale or get a gift card, this would be an excellent purchase!"
2,El Paso Chile Quesadilla Maker,I'm sorry to say that this product did not meet my expectations nor my needs. It is very cumbersome to use and quite messy! It doesn't allow enough space for more substantial ingredients. It also took too long to heat up and to cook the quesadillas.It might be ok for a single person use but not for a family of 3 or 4. I had better luck making quesadillas with my panini maker.
2,Handle Broke Off,We got this quesadilla maker for Christmas and have been very pleased with it until today when the handle broke off. We were just making quesadillas with cheese in them so it wasn't too full of ingredients. I guess that part was just cheaply made.
4,Lots of fun,"This item is as described and functioned as it was meant to. Important to read instructions as to how much filling to use, though, as it's easy to overfill--like I did!!!"
4,Good!,"I recieved this product for Christmas last year and I absolutely love it! I'm a tech savvy person but not completely ""in the know"" so I may be a little off here. The power cord I got with this product stopped working a few weeks after I got it so that's why this is only a 4 star review. However, it can charge by simply being plugged into a computer (even though it takes longer). Overall I love my Ematic reader!"
1,Makes you want to go postal,"I bought two of these thinking they were a good deal. I could not get them to do anything it was supposed to. I returned both of them to the manufacturer for repair, because it was too late to return for a refund. When I got them back 6 weeks later, everything was the same. Some of the problems were: wouldn't hold charge, wouldn't let you down/upload any thing off the internet, the apps were pathetic, no sound unless you used ear buds, couldn't set up email, keyboard not working properly... These are going back to the manuf. in little pieces!!!"
3,PRE-Review of this item,"I have just ordered this video off of an EBAY listing ($9.00) and am hoping it will finally have some VIDEO FOOTAGE of his interrogation back in 1978 or at the very least additional video of him discussing his case with anyone of the police, psychiatrists/psychologists,lawyers, etc... from 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, etc...I am an avid collector of all things Gacy and have amassed a very big collection of him, particularly books, videos, miscellaneous stuff, etc...but HAVE YET to see a photo of him from the 1980 trial. Why is this?! Good grief, how frustrating..!"
3,Eh....,"Loved the rifts and drums, disliked the vocals, thumbs in the middle for this one. If you guys are rich, you're lyrics lose a lot of meaning. ""Keepin' it real,"" LOL!"
4,Enjoyable reading...,and does help to change the way we see. The excercises suggested are awesome to do. The photographs offered impressive. Best suggestion: Do the excersises. (We do learn by doing). I read and did and my vision was expanded. (Never had I considered taking a photograph for texture!) Of the photography books I have thus far this is one of the best.
4,The Next Level of Composition,"Many (probably the vast majority from my experience) of books on photographic composition never go beyond ""the rule of thirds"" or ""watch for S-curves"". Although this book, by necessity, repeats much of the information we've all heard many times before, if other ways to goes to the next level by applying some old ""rules"" in unique ways or by breaking the ""rules"" in ways that add impact. The pictures are very good and by themselves would make the book worthwhile. I sometimes struggle for subjects in my immediate area, but this book encourages me to look at relatively common sights in a new way. Clears out photographers block, in a matter of speaking."
3,Teaching creativity?,"I purchased this book, only to realize that all the writer can do is teach you his style. It does show you the difference between snap shots and decent photographs. The key lesson in the book is to look for an unusual angle. Differentiate your pictures from snapshots.A Photography student would be better off, looking at every picture you see, and try to learn from it. Experiment, and join your local Photography club. You will learn a lot more at the club than any book can teach you -- assuming you already understand the Basics. To Learn the Basics get the National Geographic Field Guide.Look at this book in the library. 5 minutes is all you need with it."
2,"""An Introduction to"" ...Learning to Seeing Creatively","Maybe I should attribute some blame to myself first for assuming that this book would deliver some ""creative"" ideas and criticism for composing photographs. Although an amateur photographer (advanced with a focus on landscape) I feel that I already have a strong grasp of basic photographic composition concepts.In purchasing this book I was looking for the type of compositional analysis that critiques ""good"" photos with a view to making them ""great"" photos. In this book the author certainly does not stimulate anything (for me at least) beyond moving from taking ""snap-shots"" to taking a basic composed ""photograph"".A useful introductory book but certainly not what I could term useful for the advanced; amateur or professional."
5,Buy it!,"Wonderful photography, nice stories about their taking, lot's of helpful advice and examples, and no boring pictures about the authors equipment. Anything else to say about this book? Yes: buy it! (******)"
3,This book is more about using extreme lenses.,"Bryan Peterson's book has many beautiful images with most showing before and after shots. The before shot is usually taken with one lens and the improved after shot is taken with another lens. Unfortunately, many of these after shots are taken with expensive extreme lens from ultra-wide angles (20 mm) to super telephotos (300 mm+), to macros and extension tubes. In other words, lenses I don't have and can't afford. There are better books out there that really do tell you how to see creatively, regardless of the equipment you have, that will be much more beneficial in improving your compositions and seeing differently. Some by Freeman Patterson come immediately to mind. Unless, of course, you do have the gear. If so, then go for it."
1,Broken - not sturdy,"Just received these baskets and was very disappointed. The large one was broken in the front. Also, the description indicated they had a sturdy frame which it does not. Very disappointing, especially considering the price."
3,"Look great, but not sturdy","I love the look of these baskets, but they are not terribly sturdy. The variety of sizes is exactly what I was looking for, but don't rest anything heavy on them!"
3,"Great alternative to a headset, with sporadic issues","Overall, the speakerphone works great. However, every now & then, folks at the other end have reported hearing an echo - so keep a pair of headphones as backup or be ready to hit the mute button when you're not talking."
4,its nice but i was sent the c100s instead of the c100 so its made for Skype and does not have the features for my windows laptop,"Too much trouble to send back - voice quality very good, product is good and functions as expected. Wish i had been sent the right model since i need it to work with MS Lync and not Skype."
3,Dependable and Servces it's purpose,"I've had this HD for over a year now. I'm running XPSP2 and using the included StorageSync software and so far, no problems. It's off most of the time, until I switch it on to do a backup. I don't use it as a daily HD, so dependability in my scenario is from light use and really no performance demands, as I just hit ""Backup"" in the software and let it do it's thing."
2,Does not work with Windows98SE-HP Pavillion4550Z,Nice looking Drive...compact and lightTech Support cannot be reached by phoneInstallation for Windows98SE (1paragraph)located on SimpleTech website did not work.Emailed Tech Support with explanation ofproblems incurred but they were as confusedas I was.....so my advice is too sail-on-bythis product if you have Windows98SE
1,This is my third one.,I went through two of these drives before I got to the third that worked. I have had it for 2 years now and it has worked fine.
5,excellent!,"SimpleTech's 250 GB SimpleDrive External Hard Drive is a great product. I was looking for a place in which to save all my media (pictures, videos, music, etc) since my computer was having a hard time with the huge amount of files. The transfer of this files was really easy, plus with the 'StorageSync Backup' software included, I can keep a full backup of my hard drive, and easily update the backup with two clicks!I really recommend this hard drive to anyone looking for a place to keep important or media files."
1,When it breaks... you are out of luck,"This product worked fine for a few months. It was little loud but very passable.The problems began when it suddenly had so many bad sectors that it wouldn't work at all. It didn't respond to re-formatting or host of other disk repair tools I attempted to use. That's okay, these things happen. The real problem is the SimpleTech support team is absolutely non-existent.Here's what I tried:- Calling the support line. Result: Infinite Hold with no person ever available.- Using their email form for an RMA request. Form results in a case number and instructions to fax some required info (product id numbers, original sales receipt, etc).- Fax the forms and wait for contact from the Support Team.Nothing. Never any response at all. This thing is now a paper weight and a lesson in dealing with 3rd rate suppliers.The funny thing is they keep sending me their ""special offer"" emails - as if I would buy from them again. I wish there was a zero star option on Amazon."
1,Wouldn't power on,"When I got the hard drive, it wouldn't power on.I tried to return it to Amazon for a replacement, but they tell me that this drive is currently not available (even thought the page says ""in stock""? whatever), so I have to pick out a different drive...."
1,Don't Buy this,"Don't be tempted by the low price on this one. You get what you pay for. Three days after loading data on to the disk, the disk starts making a consistent clicking noise. It grinds to a halt when trying to access data, and basically it is useless at this point. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for a Seagate."
1,Macs can't boot from USB-only drives,"Mac users, be careful: Macs running OS X cannot boot from external USB drives. Only Firewire external drives are bootable."
1,Disappointed with Amazon's Service,"I wish I was able to review this product, but the one Amazon sent me was junk. Upon opening the box, it was clear that the product had been previously returned (the return labels were still inside). It's as if Amazon accepted the return and put the product right back on its shelves.The product was also missing the USB cord necessary to hook it to a computer. Luckily, I had one on hand; however, this didn't help. After plugging the product in, it didn't even work.I hope that the replacement Amazon sends me will be up to par with the quality standards its customers expect."
2,Customer Service sucks so bad,My external mysteriously erased all my music and wouldn't connect to my computer one day out the blue. After a week of trying to get a RMA number from Simpletech this is calling them and waiting on hold for over 45 mins each time and no response to emails I finally got a guy named Tony Lanzi who at first seemed great but when I mailed it back and forgot that the address they had wasn't where I was anymore I emailed him and advised him to send it to a new location ( I have email traffic for this entire situation) it went to some random address and I've emailed Tony numerous times to get it taken care of and of course he won't reply then we finally got ahold of someone only to find out that they don't know what we are talking about so we read the email traffic and now after 6weeks they will send another one out.
4,"So far, Mostly Good","I've had this drive for a couple of months now. I basically use it as a backup for my 2 internal HDDs. The drive has been great with one exception. I have to plug the drive into one of the USB ports on the front of my computer. I don't know what the difference is between the USB ports in the rear and the front, I assume they're on a different USB Controller, but when I plug it into one of the rear ports, the drive shows up as dead/not working. Just be aware that if you have only one controller and it's the same as mine, the drive could seem to be DOA.Aside from this, the drive has been flawless. It's fast and quiet (no noises at all for me). I leave it on for extended periods and then sometimes will turn it off for long periods.As long as the drive continues to function as it has (and I have no reason to think it won't) then I'm very happy with the purchase."
1,Prepare for That DAY!!,"I've used the machine well for the past 2.5 years, then the day came of a sudden, unexpected, unannounced failure, which means all my stored data (almost full to the capacity in my case) is GONE! My one star rating may be too harsh for the product- but my purpose is to warn you to prepare for that day lest you should weep and nash your teeth. I know it's quite a generic problem with any HD. Personally I keep two external HDs and store important files (key business and family info) on both HDs and, as soon as one breaks down unexpectedly, immediately go buy another one and copy files to it so that I maintain two backup copies at all times. The mathematical probability of two HDs failing on the same day should be one millionth if the longevity of a HD is 1000 days. Hope it helps.."
4,Good and helpfull,"I got this driver to replace one broken from Segate, it has been working well but I think the cable to connect it to the pc is to short difficulty the setting in the desk and also it look like the communication with my laptop is slower than the Seagate one I had before."
1,"Wasting money, loosing your information","It is a piece of junk that steals your information and dies completely in 2.5 months. Besides you never get your money back or replacement which any way you would not like to use again not to loose your information again. The company does not respond to your e-mails with RAM case number and address where to return the product. The web site is under profilaxy very often but it does not help even if it is active. If you call by phone and reach someone, you are promised that the RAM case number and all info will be e-mailed you immediately. But nothing happens. Within 2 weeks I communicated with them via e-mail and phone 5 times. Nothing happens. The only thing you can do is just to throw this absolutely useless piece of junk into a trash can and forget."
1,we bought and returned 2 units; terrible high-pitch noise,"i mean really terrible, like a dog whistle, except for humans. you can't be in the same room with the thing."
1,SimpleTec External 250G USD Pinifarina,"used to work great, now my PC will not recognize it with a drive letter - its shows the volume but won't let me do anything with it.This was after I transferred a few of my wife's MAC files onto it.I tried the open-case-and-jiggle routine - that did not help.The drive in my unit is by SEAGATE"
1,Unreliable drive. After a year of use the drive fried itself. I lost everything.,"I'd used this external hard drive for a year as a back-up for my laptop. I had my entire iTunes library, video projects, photos, documents and applications library on it. Luckily the applications and documents are on my laptop but the iTunes library and video projects that I had spent hours working on are gone forever. Don't give SimpleTech your money. Their hardware will fail and you will lose all your data."
1,Do Not Purchase,Purchase this drive ONLY if you enjoy having your computer run at half speed while this thing takes nearly TWENTY FOUR HOURS to back up 6.5 gigs of data. You could write each of your files down in Chinese in the time it takes this POS to back them up. Totally worthless.
2,Worked great for 6 months,"We bought three of these drives over a period of several months. Not one of them lasted more than 6 months. The failures all started the same: The computer would not recognize the drive, then it would, then it wouldn't, until one day it finally stopped recognizing it completely. Rather than return the drives, I installed them in an old computer we are using as a server. Two of the drives had to be reformatted, and only one still had all the files on it. So it appears the problem is with the drive enclosures and not the drives themselves. My recommendation? Don't put anything on one of these drives that you can't afford to lose."
1,Beware of Lost Data,"Like others, this hard drive just stopped working for me. It no longer could be recognized by any computer, causing me to lose tons of sentimental photos and other data."
3,Installation was a dream,"I received the SimpleDrive 250 GB External drive and within 15 minutes had the drive installed. I also installed the included backup software and was doing a full backup within minutes. The backup completed successfully after a fairly long time: I backed up a 60 GB drive which had over 155,000 files on it. All in all, a very good eperience."
4,SimpleDrive 250 External Hard Drive,Delivery was ontime and item is very simple to use. For some reason the product only has 232 GB not 250 GB available.
1,Do Not Recommend,Quit working within three or four months and I cannot get anyone to replace it. I certainly would not recommend it to anyone else.
1,A waste of money!,"This is quite possibly the worst external drive I have ever owned.It frequently loses data, or stops working completely. Audio files stored on it end up having a scuzzy sound in the background.I stopped bothering to use it after about a month, and haven't touched it again since.It's basically a large expensive paperweight.Don't waste your money."
1,Hard-luck drive,Terrible. Quit working after 9 months. I've been backing up data files and photos on it since last summer - now the drive is making soft clicking sounds indicating that the drive is dying. I'll never buy another SimpleTech product. Good luck to all of you who are using this product - better back up your backups!
1,Doesn't Work - Poor Customer Service,"The drive has only worked intermittently for me (three times out of about a dozen attempts). I have a Dell laptop, less than one year old, with the latest device drivers and running XP. SimpleTech have sold me a faulty drive.SimpleTech's solution to my problem is to return the drive to them at my expense, when they will finally send me a replacement. I fail to see why I should be out of pocket due to their faulty goods."
1,I gave it back,"I wanted to use this 250 GB device for backing up my 500 CDs (as mp3). Installation worked fine. The transfer of a 43 GB folder with audio files basically worked fine, but the transfer of another folder with 9 GB didn't go through, XP couldn't identify the problem. I tried to play the apparently well transferred files with iTunes and MS Mediaplayer. It started and paused, started and paused etc. I called the hotline and got a competent and friendly guy who recommended to format what I did. Didn't go through as well and then I gave it back."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!,"I own both a Seagate 160 and this Simpletech SimpleDrive 250 GB. The internal hard drive fried in less than two months. I admit that I worked the hard drive often and expected a lot from it...just as I had with the Seagate. First off, the SimpleDrive is so noisy, sounds like a car starting. Has very minimal venting so it gets hot quick, thus the reason mine fried. Seagates has many vents for cooling. I called Simple Tech and customer service was excellent. It's ashame their product is far more inferior than its competitor. Pay the extra couple bucks and get something you can depend on."
4,A Stunner,"What a handsome book this is! I can't decide whether I liked the photos more or the text. The history is elegantly written and fascinating. How many people realize that Boston was literally created from the marshlands, spoonful by spoonful. The cast of characters who lived in this so-called Athens of America had an equally splendid selection of architects and places to live. The photos are a real treasure. I keep turning back to so many. The first edition was a classic, my mother told me. And this updated one has not only the older traditional rownhouses and state house and the pictures of the monumental construction of such attractions as the PUblic Garden and Common but a new cast. There are images of neon lights and amusement parks and the author (whose last book Asphalt Nation was a stunner with a polemic cast) has added photos of saved and threatened buildings to tell the 2lst century story. I couldn't recommend this more."
3,Lost Boston,"While this book has great pictures and such, I didn't really find much use of it. I'm sure there's a synopsis about it online somewhere so I won't go there, but honestly, I would only recommend this book to people who are interested in this type of book."
4,Good General Information Provided,"After looking at other reviews of the same book, I still went with it even though everyone agreed that the book was much less complete than it has been in the past. If you need to know how much unique items list for, get the software. The book is extremely general. Many items I had to write-in and ballpark a figure. I chose the book, because it was portable to where I was sorting through our piles and piles of donatable goods. I still found about 90% of the stuff I was donating in the pages of the book."
1,Too thin on content and guarantees,"I have happily used this guide for the past few years now. I am returning this year's guide. As another reviewer noted, the level of detail has gone down dramatically. Men's, Women's, Boy's, Girl's and Infants' clothing prices now are covered in just two pages for all five categories. The ""defense guarantee"" in the event of an audit question by the IRS has been removed.I am undecided on whether to put the purchase price of the book toward the software or find another evaluation method."
1,Its Deductible Workbook Review,I was very disappointed in the workbook. I had used the CD method last year which is much more extensive. Many of the items I was interested to deduct were not in the book. I would not purchase it again. It was a waste of money
5,A simple roadmap to terrific recordings,"Knowing next to nothing about computer recording techniques..._""How to Do Everything with Garageband"" walked me through the steps and answered my questions before I asked them. The result was I made a recording that exceeded my hopes and it was a lot simpler than I expected, thanks to the book. Especially useful was the step by step approach...from beginning to the finished recording. A terrific book."
2,"Wrong fit, wrong color","These shoes had a strong chemical smell to them, and they were more like a green metallic than a bronze. They were also too big for me. The biggest disappointment was in the color. But my mom tried them on and they fit her great (her feet are a half size bigger than mine).So while they weren't at all what I was expecting, my mom got a free pair of shoes!"
1,Cannot recommend product or seller,"I ordered these shoes and spent almost half the listed price in shipping. When I received them, they did indeed smell toxic, fit horribly, and were nowhere near the color (bronze) in the photograph. In fact, they appeared more of an army green. The return as yet has not been credited to my card, but I did spend about 2/3 of the original shipping charge to send item back to seller. Overall, I spent about $18 for nothing. Bad first experience. It will be my last. I do not recommend product or seller."
3,Alright,this gun is pretty good. I bought it a couple of days a go. My friend accidentally tossed it and the barrel broke and it will not go back on. overall it is a good gun as long as you do not let any of your friends toss it.
1,Broken gun,The battery for this gun is inop. Store was good about sending another battery but gun is still not working. Now it is going to cost money to ship gun back to store. I wished it worked the first time ane return was easier.
1,Suckish Gun,"This is a very sucky gun. It lasted a few days. After I began playing games, it broke. The magazine stinks. After shooting like 10 bullets I had to turn it upside to get it to shoot. How do you expect me to win a game with an upside down airsoft gun? Answer that."
4,Great Vocals from an Underappreciated Group,"For years I knew the Vibrations for their one big hit ""The Watusi,"" the song ""Peanut Butter,"" recorded under their alias The Marathons, and their lesser known orginal version of ""Hang On Sloopy"" called ""My Girl Sloopy."" I bought this cd on a whim and wow, what a discovery! The group absolutely ranks with the best of the male peers including the Motown male groups. It's criminal that ""Oh Cindy"" was not a national hit. Their version of ""Misty"" and ""And I Love Her"" are standouts.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't know their complete catalog to say if these cuts are truly ""the very best."" However, just hearing this cd makes me want to delve into their catalog even more. The Vibrations' music is an essential for any serious classic R&B; collector. You might as well start with this collection."
1,Tiny!!!,BEWARE this is a sample size!! I think the price is ridiculous for a 2-3 times application. Ignore the 1.2 lb shipping weight - no weigh (LOL) it weighs even close to that.
4,hate to iron!,"Love this machine! I've been ironing my nursing uniforms for almost 30 years now, the old fashion way. Its not only a time saver, but my uniforms look crisp & professional. However, prepare yourself, there is a learning curve. Definitely worth it in the end! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the cost."
1,Very dissapointing,We bought this product and after only 3 months it quit working. I had to pay shipping both ways to get it fixed under warranty and after 3 months of waiting for it to be fixed we got it back then it only lasted for another three months before quitting on us again. This one is going in the garbage and if we do decide to buy another one it will certainly not be this brand.
2,I used the steam press very little for 1 year before steam function stopped working,"I received a SteamFast Model SF-680 as a gift and used it very little for approximately 1 year before the steam function stopped working. Since the item was no longer covered by warranty, I removed the bottom plate, tested the water pump motor, and found it to be defective. I have found that determining what was wrong is the easy part of solution, finding a source for the part is the difficult part. I have contacted many retail outlets and Top Innovations,Inc. via internet and phone without success. The problem must be: since item manufactured in China and original cost so inexpensive parts are not available. Hope I am wrong and if anyone knows of a source for parts please respond."
4,very pleased,I never thought ironing could be fun. This is great and it really can give you the same level of pressing that you get from the cleaners.
5,Favorite Product,This steam press without a doubt was the best purchase I have made in a long time. The price was excellent for the quality and craftmanship. The color and style was perfect. I am happy with my new steam press. No Regrets at all!
4,Mom of 2,"i was really excited to get this product. My husband constantly requires for someone to iron and I thought I would not only save money but also save time and do less work. This became true to a certain extent, if the pants have no pleats and are made of cotton its wayyyyy easier than something that does have pleats or is made of super wrinkly material like linen. I think other reviews have mentioned that you will still need a small iron to iron out detailing of clothing, this is very true. To make perfect creases its an awesome product, but it doesnt get into tight spots of clothing."
3,Steam Fast SF-680,"I purchased the Steam Fast to iron shirts. It is a lot faster, however, it's really hard to iron shirts without getting some unwanted creases. It works much better on pants or larger items. The lid does not lift up perpendicular to the base, so it's hard to place fabric towards the back of the base without touching the top which is very hot. Not really sure it was worth the money."
1,NO STEAM- NO HEAT-NO CAN DO,THE STEAM PRESSER WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. I LET IT WARM UP FOR 30 MIN. AND I COULD STILL PUT MY HAND ON THE IRONING SURFACE. I GUESS THAT IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU PURCHASE SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.
1,"FAILLLLL, scrolling text at the bottom, head hurting audio, video is image overlay on another and its all at fast tempo,FAILLL","FAILLLLL, scrolling text at the bottom, head hurting audio, video is image overlay on another and its all at fast tempo,FAILLL. Think this movie was produced by some LSD,and mushroom lovers.IF ur wanting useful knowledge of Tesla, go somewhere else."
2,Replace with LED bulb,"This is a cute light but the previous reviewer is correct, the bulb does melt against the blue plastic. We are replacing with a LED bulb that does not get hot. Major fire hazard otherwise."
2,For temporary use only...Save your money!,I thought this product at my local Gardenridge before reading the reviews on Amazon and I wish that I had read the reviews first. After leaving the light on in my daughters room for a few nights because she loves it I saw it on Amazon and went into her room to turn it off I didn't look at it... Sure enough the plastic around it was very hot and it looked as though plastic beads were melting together. I then looked at the tag and it very clearly states that the light is for for temporary use 90 days max only. Not worth the money at all or chance that it might catch fire if by chance you should leave it on longer.
2,Buy something else,"It came scratched, the plastic is cheap- you pay for the Disney logo, not for the product. Buy something else."
2,Easy Sushi,This video moves at such a slow pace I barely made it through the first 15 minutes. After finishing the video I felt like I had wasted my time. The video does help a bit but you should spend your money elsewhere. I recommend a video called Ken Sushi. This video will be of much more help.
3,"""THE TELLING CORPSE""","I enjoyed reading this book - it shows how far forensics have progressed, even over the last few years. They have to try & keep ahead of the criminal/murderers/and all other elements of the darkest side of humanity."
4,Comparing 3 harps in same price range...,"The Hohner Pro harp has a very similar sound to the Lee Oskar but the painted blackpaint made it slower and not as smooth on the lips as well as before long flaking.The Seydel Session had the best feel in the hands with its thicker yet tampered ends lower profile, but pretty mellow and not as reedy or defined in sound. This would be my preferred harp when amplified, as one could adjust the tone at the amp controls.All good harps at comparably good prices.PS If your a beginner it's probably best to buy a G major harp which is mid in range and neither to high or low or as a second choice a C major.Happy Harping...Brad"
5,Hope,I don't like the idea of transferring the hope of creating good works of art to approval from the establishment as opposed to the acceptance from the heart of the streets and public at large... the establishment is always the last to recognize the true talent that has usually already captured the heart of the people... This sums it up in a nutshell!
3,A Singer Without a Song by Anthony Deige,a singer without a song is a must read. it makes you want to keep turning the pages. great work anthony
4,KINDA FRAGILE,"Was using this cable for a few days. The retractable lock snagged the thin wires, and wound up ripping the RCA head off.Sounds great in the stereo, just be careful when extending the cable."
5,Why pay More?,Why pay more for an item like RCA cables from Belkin or Monster? This is not rocket science- its a simple cable. Its bordering on an insult to pay Belkin and Monster's high prices. Works great everytime and its retractable. No more wrestling with a rat's nest in my bag.
4,Must have for House fo the Dead 2,"It is the best Sega has to offer.Is has some great features such as auto reload and continous fire,but it also has some problems.It makes a clicking sound when you fire the gun,although it doesn't bother me I heard it bothers some people.Also the next morning after I had used it the night before my arm was very sore(I guess that is supposed to happen).All in all this is a good gun that you have to have for House of the Dead 2."
4,Great Gun,"I bought this gun, and house of the dead 2. I have to say thw gun is very good, the aim is a little off sometimes, but if you have a rumble pack or a vmu in the controler the gun has very good balance, without a vmu ur rumble back the gun is a little light, and the balance isnt right, if u want to get house of the dead 2, u need this gun"
4,The best!,I liked this gun alot for playing House of the Dead 2. It was great with its 3 different modes. The only thing i dislike about this great toy is that the start button is in t wierd place if you are right handed. All in all it is the best in its field.
1,Possibly the worst piece of fiction written in a long time,"I had hoped to find Mr. Davis' book interesting and suspenseful. Instead I had ""the mystery"" figured out before the first 50 pages. The absence of knowledge about the Air Force, computer systems, AFOSI and other military practices, procedures and techniques leads me to believe Mr. Davis gets what he knows from television and the movies. Please do yourself a favor and stick to Dale Brown or W.E.B. Griffin and let us hope Mr. Davis finds a new genre upon which to demonstrate his lack of talent."
5,The General,I've read all three of his books and this one is his best one. All of the suspects that Patrick Davis brings up die one by one until there are none left. It was hard for me to put down as I wanted to find out what was on the next page as there he was taking you on a suspenseful ride with twists thrown in. The ending has a surprise twist to it.
5,Fast and Excellent,"Pat does a fantastic job in his first book. Excellent plot and fast paced throughout. I can't wait for his next book ""The Passenger"" to come out."
3,----------- Jim Bond --------------,"He is the worst narrator of all time. i listen to alot of audio books while traveling, driving or working. but this reader is the worst of all timehis voice just b|ows, its so annonying. i hope not to ever run in to any of more audio books by him. i am trying to listen to Terry goodkind books but LORD jim bond is reading them.its a freaking nightmare"
2,Starts Well Then Becomes Tedious And Predictable,"The General starts off like a fast jet but then drags on for much too long a time. Further, you are likely to guess the ending well before you get there. For me the only thrilling part of this so-called thriller was when I came to the last page and could move on to my next book."
3,"Good book, but lacks in military accuracy","I enjoyed reading this book, and I didn't figure out ""whodunit"" until near the end of the book. All-in-all, it was a good read and is proboably quite enjoyable for non-military readers. However, being a 13 year enlisted AF member, I was constantly bothered by the inaccurate military language, etc. I was especially annoyed every time the Chief Master Sergeant Jones character was addressed as ""Sergeant"". Anyone who has been in the Air Force for any amount of time at all knows that the proper address for a Chief Master Sergeant is ""Chief""."
4,couldn't put it down!!,"When I first started reading the Gereal I thought oh no just another POW story that you hear all the time but as the story moved on it got interesting and I couldn't wait to finish to see what had happened! I look forward to more of Mr. Davis's books, if he's first book was so interesting , just think what he's next well be like!!"
3,It happened in my hometown!!!!!!,"I thought I heard that in the 1980s, a man in Canada killed many nurses. However, this says it happened in the 1960s in Chicago. My mother worked as a nurse in the city at that time. I wasn't expecting this to hit close to home, but it did!This was a good ""Biography"" installment. It's just as good as the one on serial killers like Richard Ramirez, Jeffrey Dahmer, or John Wayne Gacy.The work doesn't just cover the tragic murders. It speaks of his childhood and crises that may have deformed his character. The work wants to keep your attention, but it does not go over the top like a horror film would.What was most important to me was the aftermath. They show how Speck in prison wore panties, grew jugs, and was traded among darker-hued inmates. For those who like jus talionis, they may really like seeing this part."
3,Gets the job done,Nothing fancy. This product is pretty affordable and my jewelry (bracelets) look pretty neat in this organizer. I've gotten a good use out of this item. I like it
3,Not worth the $!,"This was a waste of $17 for me...the base is nice and sturdy, but if all you want to do is look at and admire your bracelets, go ahead and get it. If you actually are always taking bracelets on and off it is a real pain. To get a bracelet you want off, you are holding the base and yanking on a bar, that is tight and secure in its holding clip...all the bracelets either must come off to get to one in the middle, or they will fall off in the process of all this yanking.I swallowed my loss and instead went and purchased something like this, but I found it in black faux leather on competitor Eeeebay...its over $30 but worth it:[...]This item is not only very nice looking, but sturdy, the faux leather is really nice, love this piece, it displays your items so beautifully.Or try this one:[...]"
1,DIdn't get what I ordered,I ordered the bracelet holder and received the necklace holder. Trying to send something back costs more time and expense than the item is worth.
1,"Was very displeased, it was bent when it came in","It was bent when it came in, the company requested just pictures of it and I sent them a letter along with the pictures and decided if it was that flimsy I didn't want it and just to give me a refund. They in turn, sent me another one, so I'm awaiting a response to another letter to tell me what to do, because I requested to them not to send another one. Now another trip to the post office.Sharon M"
4,Great way to display and store bracelets,"I have several of these bracelet racks. They hold many bangles, cuffs, and bracelets where I can easily see them."
3,"Looks nice, but lacks functionality","The bracelet stands looks great with all of my bracelets displayed. However, when it comes time to add or remove a bracelet, it is very difficult to open and close the clasps that hold the rods. When I first got the stand, I thought I was going to break it because I had to pull so hard to open the clasps."
5,Mi favorito,"El Poder del Norte es mi grupo favorito. las mejores canciones son Maldito Orgullo Y Pero me Perdonas.....Claro todas son buenas, si te gusta la musica nortena este es el mejor!"
3,Not Exactly Fresh,"I expected the book to offer some good ideas through the use of visuals and movie clips for worship. The book did a good job of providing that kind of information. However, the visuals included on the DVD lacked a lot. Not only was I disappointed, but I was frustrated that I spent $21 on information that I could have gotten on the internet for free. Maybe I am cheap, but I expected better stuff on the DVD."
4,I needed this for--,a gift. I was so thankful that this book was available. It helped complete a set of books for a friend.
1,Dont buy it!,The blending canister gets stuck. You have to refridgerate it for 12 hours and then end up breaking it off. The second canister got stuck. The clips broke so the blender wont work. Not Covered under warranty. The blending canister are on back order forever! IT's a great concept with low grade materials that break and a useless warranty. Save your money. I wish I had my money back!
2,Could only use twice,"I bought this from Kohl's less than 2 weeks ago since it was $20 cheaper than the Majic Bullet. The first time it worked great, but I smelled burning rubber/plastic. From then on it got worse and hasn't worked well since second use. Apparantly the rubber ""spinner"" in the base that makes the blades move won't connect to the blade portion. I plan to return and spend the extra money for the Bullet."
1,I wouldn't even give it one star.,"I actually didn't order this through Amazon. I had been wanting a Magic Bullet, so when I saw this at Macy's (the price was right--or so I thought) I picked it up. What a disappointment! It blends and/or chops only what is at the blades, and therefore, pulverizes it. I had to stop and stir several times before the ingredients mixed for a simple tuna salad (1 can of tuna, some mayo, and a quarter of a small onion). I'm hesitant to buy the Magic Bullet for fear that their advertising is misleading and their product is no better than this. Maybe I got a dud; I don't know, but I certainly wouldn't endorse this. I think someone needs to go back to the drawing board."
4,Use it daily,"Our family has made 3-4 smoothies every day in our Bella rocket blender every day since Christmas. We love it! My only real complaint is the size of the cups. The max limit is less than 2 cups, which isn't as big as I'd like. Occasionally the vibration of the blender loosens the cup, so you have to watch for that. It's incredibly loud, eve for a blender. But it's great at blending, gets everything smooth no matter what I throw in there and has held up well so far."
3,I love it ... but it's not built to last.,"I love this thing, but I have to admit it is cheaply made. I use it to make smoothies and my husband uses it to make protein shakes, but after 3 months, the base that holds the blade cracked in half. Now I have to find something to replace it. Sure wish I could find the same thing but of better quality. The only other complaint I have is that the lids are difficult to screw on. They don't line up properly.Otherwise, the motor runs fine, it blends beautifully, it's easy to use (except for the lids), it's compact and it convenient. If you plan to use it on a regular basis - and for me that was 2-3x week - don't expect it to last very long."
1,Doesnt last,"As stated by R. Morgan, it burns out quickly...Ours lasted about 3 months before the motor burned out an bit of plastic staing buring out from the bottom. POS!"
1,horrible!,"Horrible caps with blades wore out within the year, with cracks and leaks while blending. DO NOT buy this horrible product"
2,left a lot to be desired,This worked pretty well the first few times I used it. Then it started to leak. Everytime it is used it leaks where the blades are connected underneath. Every time. Don't bother with this crappy item. Go to Bed Bath and Beyond and spend an extra ten dollars for the Bullet. This one sucks terribly.
1,It is Cheap and it is Cheap!,"We received this as a gift. So the fact that it smells like its burning doesn'tbother me that much. As many others have stated, the plastic drive dies, the vesselbecomes locked to the base and it smells like its on fire. Today it became so stuckon the base that i considered throwing it out with my smoothie aboard. Howeveri did not want to give up the protein shot. With a large screwdriver and a hammerand the Bella upside down, i chiseled the black plastic ring away and freed the smoothie.Now the lock down feature no longer works but i can hold the smoothie in place whilethe Bella smokes. When the Bella gives up, i will buy the CR rated Oster for 39.99."
1,"Even with gentle use, it didn't last two weeks","My wife bought this for me for my bday. I was very excited, I made approx. 1 smoothie per day (soft fruits only, no ice) and within 10 days the motor was burned out. The only way I could've been more gentle with this item was to not use it at all, which apparently is what it's intended for. If you want a nice-looking, blender for display only, then this one might be for you. If you want an appliance that you can actually use, you should look elsewhere. I'm going to try an immersion blender for my smoothies."
2,not a great mixer. barely does what it says and not for long.,"You have to press the cup down coninuously to ensure proper engagment of the coupler to the blade. if you don't press correctly ordisengage evenly, little pieces of plastic get stripped off. very soon, the coupler no longer works at all.Its a poorly designed system. I do not recommend it."
4,As good as a Magic Bullet for less money,"I bought this on the cheap at Macy's, like some of the other reviewers of this blending system. I wasn't about to pay the prices Magic Bullet charges. Also, if you dislike this system, go to the Magic Bullet on the Amazon site and read the reviews - many MANY bad reviews, so you may as well pay less for this one.It looks like there aren't any perfect blending systems out there. Even my very small Cuisinart blender really sucks and that's why I bought this one. I figured, what the hell, it couldn't be any worse.I only use mine for chopping nuts and medicinal herbs into a fine powder to use in baking and this Cocina thing works just fine for that. But I don't use it very often.I'm wondering if anyone has ever tried to make good of the warranty if this product fails too quickly. The reviewers of the Magic Bullet say that company has really bad customer service."
2,Fragile motor - not recommended,"Bought from Macy's (great customer service). Used for a few weeks but for some reason, the plastic wheel on top of the motor developed a groove on it from normal use, eventually getting to a point where it no longer gripped its counterpart on the blade side. This happened over the course of 2 months until one day it just stopped running - the motor ran but the blade stayed still. Macy's was great - gave me my money back promptly."
1,Junk!,"I bought this at Macy's 2 years ago when it was on sale. I was shocked at how bad it was.Useless!I understand ""Magic Bullet"" is the real thing."
3,Smoothie Maker,This product works well but the rings to apply to the mixer container are not comfortable to drink from.
3,No instructions,"We got this as a Christmas present, but there were no instructions or registration information. When I Emailed the company, they just directed me to download their 44 page instruction book off the internet. Not what I expected."
1,Plastic pieces broke and leaks within a month,First the o-ring for one of the blade assemblies came out and snapped in pieces while blending (lucky there is two). Blender cup often gets stuck in blender so I have to stand there and hold cup in blender rather than locking the cup in. Plastic cup and parts in blender are aready cracking and breaking off. Blended great but now looking for a new blender after only a couple months because now it leaks with the second blade assembly and half the cups are damaged too badly to use.
1,bad issues regarding blender,"I bought this in May 2009. In 2010, the metal piece of the actual metal blades broke and now I can't use it. I called the company and they said they were out of stock and would email me when they get one. It has been 7 months. Good luck on finding replacement parts. Another issue is that it does not blend well using ice cubes. I had to stop it several times to stir. Since I got no response back from manufacturer on my part, I bought a single size Hamilton Beach blender. So far the blades have not broken and it blends very well. Cost was cheaper."
2,No comparison,"This will work fine for mixing and normal usage. If you use it daily, and especially with anything frozen, you will burn out the motor. I make smoothies with frozen fruit atleast once a day, and this maybe lasted a few months. Spend the extra $20 and get yourself a real magic bullet. I've had it for 3.5 years and it still works great!!!"
1,"nice for single-serve shakes, but literally nothing else","i don't know what the magic bullet is like, but i hope it's a lot better than this P.O.S.tried it for my morning shakes, and it blended very well.then i tried it for chopping vegetables. parts of it were pureed, while the rest were in chunks.tried it for an omelet. two eggs and some mushrooms....that's pretty much all your omelet can be in this blender. anything else will be chunky and....chunky.in conclusion:liquids--win.non-liquids--FAIL.this is something to add to your kitchen for ONE use. if you have the counter top space for it (it's small, but regardless, it's one more thing sitting around), sure why not. but if you were looking for something for multiple uses, this isn't it."
2,keep looking...,"Conceptually this is a great product, technically it is not. Had the blender for about 3 months and the motor burned out. If you only use it once in awhile to make an occasional smoothie its probably ok. I use it once or twice daily for a morning protein shake and it clearly isn't designed for frequent use."
2,Do Not Buy this Product,"I received this as a gift from my mom because I mentioned that we wanted to buy the magic bullet. We used it on a regular basis (about 2-3 times a week). After about 3 months we started smelling burnt rubber/plastic. About a month later it just couldn't grind anymore. The base piece had been worn down and wasn't catching on the blending piece. We figure, no problem we can find a replacement part. We were wrong. Not only did we Not find a replacement part on their website, they promoted other products for you to cook with and buy. Not only that, but its pretty much impossible for you to get a replacement part and replace the piece yourself. They have some two prong thing, and I couldn't even begin to tell you what kind of tool would fit there (maybe needles), and I'm pretty handy. I am very disappointed. When it worked it was awesome,but not worth the money if you have to buy it over again and again.Bella Cucina 17-Pc Rocket Blending System 10029"
1,poor quality,"Very poor quality. After one month use, the motor no longer catch the blade, the motor runs but do not blend."
5,Unredeemed Rhetorc,"This book, for fans of Thomas Nashe or of 1600th century English literature, is a well-written description of Thomas Nashe and his mere greatness. I advise for any such mind who so dearly holds Nashe to their hearts as I, that this book will only spark within you a new sense of awe for both Nashe and Crewe (the author). --Daniel S. Batten Londonderry, NH"
3,Piccolo's end,"Not a starting point for new readers. The final fight between Demon Lord Piccolo is under way. Although Piccolo losses he leaves behind a new incarnation of himself, Piccolo Jr, to avenge his death. With only three years to train, Goku makes a deal with Kami-Sama, God, to train in heaven. This first part is great, but the start of the tournament feels a little weak."
3,DBZee,"It was interesting in so far as the fact that the book was not very different from the series, I used it to remind myself of the first episodes of DBZee, I would recommend it as a tool to jog the memory ;-))"
4,seems effective,"I got this because I had an abcess and the retarded doctor just told me to take warm baths and massage it. I did this and it wouldn't go away so I wanted to boost my immune system. Eventully I went to another doc who gave me an antibiotic and cleared it up so I didn't get a chance to see if it would have helped on its own. However, I can say that after using this product, my nose becomes runny which appears to mean my immune system is in actions. So it does seem to boost the immune system and does give a little energy."
4,Murder by molasses is no laughing matter,"If you aren't aware of the Molasses Flood of 1919, you are likely, as I was, to chuckle just thinking about the Boston waterfront coated in the sticky stuff. But Stephen Puleo's narrative of this event is terrifying, heartbreaking, dramatic, yet never seems sensationalist. He opens the door to reveal a history not just of an isolated terrible tragedy, but the ongoing struggle between corporate power, politics, and ethnic/class stratification. This book isn't just about the fifteen foot high wave that killed over 20 people (according the legal ruling) and injured multitudes of others, but is about what justice really means when an unexpected tragedy takes center stage against the backdrop of society's everyday tragedies. Beautifully written and extensively researched, this is one of the riveting historical accounts I've ever read."
2,Not especially engaging,"Overall, the book was entertaining and seemingly well researched (although I think some of the historic information relied a little too heavily on just a few sources). After reading it once, though, I will never read this book again (I don't want to be reminded of this stuff!)"
5,Loved it,"History, drama, characters this book has it all.I am from Boston area which may increase appeal, since I recognize geography.Highly recommended"
4,Dark Tide,I lived in Boston for ten years and didn't know that this tragedy happened there. Very interesting book for people living in the North End of Boston.
4,"Yes, there really was a Molasses Flood","I heard about the Great Molasses Flood on a podcast several years ago, shortly after a visit to Boston. Such a bizarre thing to consider! But it really happened, it affected (and killed) real people, and like so many other tragedies is a cautionary tale about people who consider money more important than people. Well worth the read."
4,Interesting History,"Until I had visited my sister in Boston, MA., I had never heard of the ""Great Molassess Flood"". She told me of the book & title. I immediately downloaded it on my Kindle and began reading about the ""Dark Tide"". I appreciate how the author depicted (Pre-flood) various people from many walks of life. It gave s clear understanding how the various ethnic groups did not get along and why. Once the flood occurs.....it showed a city that pulled together to help one another in times of disaster. Because of the book, I did more investigating, and found there is a plaque located in downton Boston honoring those lost in the Great Molasses Flood. I would encourage those who are interested in ""Out of the Ordinary"" History to check out the Dark Tide."
5,Well written and well researched,"This book was amazing. I think of it as being divided into three parts - a picture of the political climate in Boston and the country at the time, the molasses flood itself, and the court case. I was fascinated by the ethnic make-up of Boston at that time. This book would make an awesome movie! Very well researched! I couldn't put it down."
5,Fascinating Story!,"Well written, fascinating story. Makes history come alive by describing all aspects of the story, from the manager of the tank to the poor families living in tenements in the North End of Boston."
4,very interesting book,Well written historical book.There was a tank filled with molasses which burst and caused much damage and loss of life.Steven Puloe very well researched this book for a long time especially the court room procedings.
5,A brief look at Boston History,"Growing up in Boston, I would hear the story about the Great Molasses Flood from my Italian Grandmother who lived in the North End at the time the flood occured. Steven Puleo pulls together the story of the tank, the flood and the aftermath. He weaves the story together with the history of the company who constructed the tank and the socio-political history of the early Twentieth Century. This book, written in a style that is easily accessible to everyone, is especially interesting to anyone who is interested in history."
5,Great book,"Very interesting story and well told. Unfortunately, not all Bostonians are aware of this piece of early 1900's history that took place in Boston's North End."
1,Very dangerous and poorly made,My 6 month old waterdog destroyed it in minutes and almost swallowed a big piece of rope. I do not recommend it to anyone.
4,A very lizzie christmas,"A very lizzie christmas is a great book. Lizzie's friends go to the mall and judge this years santa, lizzie also wants to help larry tudgemans float . But every body wants to help knobby lizzie is furious she thinks she has lost the true meaning of christmas.And if you like lizzie mcguire then this is the book for you."
1,Not A Good Resource,This book is so simplistic in it's design. It will not show you how to do the crafts. The diagrams are simple drawings. I can't imagine how this got published as a crafts book.
5,"A wonderful find, a wonderful book.","This book is great for parents, teachers and NIE departments. A variety of different crafts with good directions and varying difficulty. A must have for newspaper offices!"
3,Tracklist,"I like it. Great Stones and Replacements covers. Can't go wrong with a salute to Junior Kimbrough either.1. Stray Cat Blues - Jagger/Richards (c) Abkco Music Inc. (BMI)2.

1,Misinformation in the Description of this item,"I thought you might like to know that the Description of this item contains two pieces of misinformation that should be corrected, if it can be. First, capital punishment was not declared unconstitutional in the 1960s. It was temporarily declared unconstitutional in 1972 (Furman v. Georgia), but re-instated in 1976 (Gregg v. Georgia). In any case, the last person executed prior to this hiatus was not Caryl Chessman (executed in 1960) but Luis Monge who was executed in Colorado in 1967. If the item itself is as full of misinformation as its description, I wouldn't trust it!"
3,Nothing new here,"This book is mostly pictures of Kubota defending himself against a (larger) guy with his Kubotan. There is hardly any text and maybe 5 or so scenarios. There are better instructional videos on youtube, especially for someone (like me) without any martial arts training."
3,Disappointed with Kindle Formatting--again....,"Just purchased the kindle copy of this fine poet's complete poems, and I am immediately not surprised to find that the first handful of poems are not broken up stanza by stanza and that there are many spelling errors.... I feel that the kindle transcribers of books of poetry such as this and numerous others are completely violating poetry's formal ingenuity by disregarding each poem's structure and sense of poetic style, which are aspects of immense value to both great and amateur poets everywhere."
3,Six star poetry mangled for Kindle,"The poems here are lovely, tasteful, complex, devious. The hardcover version deserves six stars.I bought the Kindle version for my commute. The Kindle version is loaded with formatting gaffes and spelling errors, as if the people at Knopf simply fed it into a conversion program & never showed the result to a proofreader or other human. If you have to have it portable, the Kindle version is about 75% acceptable -- though the pricing is highly inflated vs. the product quality."
3,Kindle version is a HUGE disappointment,"It amazes me that a publisher as reputable as Knopf would allow product as carelessly presented as this to reach the marketplace. The number of EGREGIOUS spelling and formatting errors in this otherwise wonderful volume seriously detract from the enjoyment of the work. Knopf apparently scanned the printed work and them simply presented it, unproofread, to the public. Unconscionable shame to the memory of Donald Justice! And to charge $15 adds insult to the injury."
4,Collected Poems by Donal Justice,"This collection is an excellent book to add to your library. It has a large collaboration of Donald Justice's works. The only thing that was slightly disappointing, but was to be expected is the fact that some of the books were excerpts. Overall an enjoyable read and a wise purchase for both poetry and Donald Justice fans."
3,Disappointed because of Incomplete Information,"I bought this book looking for a workout that offered good resistance training requiring little equipment, since I live in an extremely small space. Although the workout appears to be an excellent one, the book misleadingly states on the cover ""All You Need Is the Body and the Band;"" however, the workout described in the book also requires a Swiss exercise ball. Ironically, I had chosen this title over the other in the series requiring the ball precisely because I do not own a ball, cannot afford to buy one at this time, do not have the space to store one, and do not have the time to inflate and deflate one each morning before heading off to grad school.If you're looking for a good workout, and have BOTH a band AND a ball, then I would recommend you try this. As for me, however, I may simply have to return this item to Amazon."
3,How About A Complete Set???,"This compilation is so random. Obviously put together by the record label with no fan consideration. Where's ""I Will Follow"", ""Celebration"", and ""The Unforgettable Fire""?? I love the old videos from ""Boy"" thru ""The Unforgettable Fire""! Will there ever be a complete video set?? Chronological order would be nice!!"
4,Good DVD for Fans,"Good set of U2 videos. Wish it were more comprehensive but they seem to always be a bit scattershot with their video collections. You get the original 'buffalo' video for 'One' here, which is nice."
2,Not as great as I hoped it would be,"I believe U2 songs are great. I especially took to appreciating their 1983 album ""War."" But none of these videos are very interesting. Nothing stands out to memory. There was nothing creative about their videos but in my opinion, to me, a great group or artist should focus more of making good music. Musicians shouldn't have to be actors too. So, I'll give this U2 DVD to somebody else. I doubt I'll ever watch it again since I have so many DVD's as it is."
2,How could they release this without a 5.1 mix,"Especially for a music based DVD, releasing it without 1 5.1 mix is simply sad."
4,A Good Way to get your Kids to Think!,"I bought this book hoping to end the ""electronic gameitis"" my son was displaying. I was not disappointed, first the book introduces a third grade classroom which my son relates to because he's in the third grade. Then it show how to write and decode a secret message. I'm still decoding secret messages sent TOP SECRET. Because it involves a mystery that is simple and somewhat common, it keeps the kids thinking ""hey, this could happen to me!"" This book is the solution to show kids that they have an imagination, no need to rely on t.v, etc... My only complaint is that's its too short."
4,Mixed satisfaction,"Yes, this is an excellent price for a Timex piece. In that sense it does its job quite well. I personally found it a little heavy for a women's watch. But other than that, I have no complaints."
2,irritating,"near impossible to install, no instructions came with it. seller website not much help either. would not buy again."
2,Nightmare to fit,Doesn't come with any instructions. Took ages to fit onto the bike but still haven't managed to make it work - I need to get a meter on it to see where the problem lies. I took the bulb out of the headlight to see what spare I needed to carry and I had a nightmare refitting the bulb. It looks a good value for money piece of kit but is spoilt by a lack of instruction. I couldn't even find information on the net.
4,Satisfactory with respect to the price,"Given the relatively low price of this item, I found it satisfactory. It does not come with instructions, but installation is simple, just bolt it on, run a wire from the ""H"" lug on the generator to the headlight and a wire from the ""T"" lug to the taillight.The headlight has two bulbs in it with a switch. The main bulb is 12V and the smaller bulb is 6V. The small bulb is useful when moving slowly, however the rider must switch back to the main bulb when increasing speed or the small bulb will burn out.The drag of the generator when engaged is very noticeable on my one speed bike, and of course there is no light when stopped.I am happy with this item for the price, but for extended biking at night, riders would be better off with a more expensive system."
1,Bullet Headlight with Generator,"All I can say in short, this product is just plain JUNK. It does NOT work, anyone trying to buy it, is wasting their money. It looks good, but it does NOT work. The headlight, you can bearly see the front wheel, (NO beam) and the taillight is so dim, you have to come up to about 5 (five) feet to see it. Generator is also a BIG problem. I am from Europe and know about headlight and generators. I could see 70 to 80 feet what's ahead on the road. But this one, nothing. And I did contact the seller, Bike World USA, and their answer showed, they do NOT know much about this product."
2,Cannot find bulbs for light set to buy at all.{12v6w}?,Cannotfind replacemt for bulbs {12v6w}.Do you know where ? I was unable the bulbs anywhere to buy replacents.
1,item sucks,"this probably would work good but it was not packaged right for shipping and arrived broke, i dont even know who to get a hold of for a refund. so im stuck with a broken piece of crap"
5,Works Great for Me,"I don't know what happened to the reviewer who said his graphics were fuzzy using this switch. Maybe he got a defective one. All I know is when I used mine to hook my old SDC to an old spare TV, it worked great! I couldn't tell any difference in video or sound from using the original cables."
1,stranger in my bed,"THE MOVIE ITSELF IS GREAT! THE QUALITY OF THE VCR TAPE IS VERY POOR. TO PURCHASE AN ITEM THAT ZIPS, AND POOR QUALITY AND FOR THE PRICE, MOST I HAVE EVER PAID FOR ANY MOVIE ON AMAZON. AND IT IS SO POOR QUALITY I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE EVER TO WATCH IT AGAIN. I THINK IT WILL SIMPLY NEVER WILL WORK AT ALL IF I WATCH IT AGAIN. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT LIKE THAT WAS OFFERED AGAIN. FROM OTHER DEALERS THAN AMAZON NEW. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SAY WHAT I FELT ABOUT MY PURCHASE."
4,Rick Steves money belt,"This is as good as anything that can be devised. The three compartments are sized for money, passport, and credit cards"
3,Average product,It was ok but seemed to make me more sweaty. Prefered the other money belt I purchased - Eagle Creek UnderCover(tm) Passport Money Case. This one wsn't as sturdy and didn't hold as much.
5,I got my money's worth,"This product was well worth the money. I went on a trip to Italy with a large group and many of us had the same thing. Some had the neck item, but wished they had the belt. It looked smooth under clothing. It kept my money and passport safe. I never worried about my belongings because it was secure. It was not overly hot -- although it was hot in Italy and it would sometimes get a bit soggy, it cleaned up nicely. Definitely worthwhile if your going to be traveling."
3,"Its Useful, But not too durable","This money belt is lightweight, discreet and waterproof. My only complaint is the ends started fraying a week after I got it, but its still works fine."
3,"ok, but not great","i was able to carry everything i needed (passport, rail pass, money, etc.) in the money belt. since it filled its basic requirements, i'm giving it 3 stars. still, the design wasn't that great. i felt that the belt was bulkier than it needed to be. the zippers too, didn't seem too reliable, and i wouldn't want to carry this belt around for an extended trip."
5,Seamless and Practical,"We got this for our trip to Italy and it was the best!!It has 2 separate pockets.. the top was great for our tickets and passports. The bottom was split in two, one to store money and the other to store our american express check card.Also it was soft and very slim, you couldn't tell it was under the shirt at all!!"
5,Perfect,Didnt even feel like i was wearing a money belt. Everything remained dry in the plastic sleave during the hot weather and the silk was very comfortable.
2,why i dont like it,"1 bulb was broke during shipping,,the first one i put into the socket blew,,so 2 out of 4 were bad,,finally the third worked but only lasted a week,,im now on the 4th bulb and its been holding up now for 5 weeks i dont recommend buying this bulb 3 out of 4 were bad"
3,130V bulb,"I purchased this bulb because it is 130V. I have a friend who works for a lighting company and she swears that bulbs with 130V last longer than those that are 120V. 120V is about all you find in stores to purchase. The only feature I havne't liked is that it is so coated with the red that the bulb is not as bright as I would have preferred. It hasn't burned out yet, but it has not been long enough since my purchase to be sure that it will outlast 120V bulbs."
5,Fluent English,We are very pleased with the Fluent English program. It arrived promptly and in pristine condition.
3,"Yeah, worth it","Being as Ravenloft is based on Victorian era gothic fiction the creation of this spinoff series seems like a forgone conclusion, why not bring the horror home to roost? It is a very good campagin package except for a few bruises and sore thumbs here and there. Some of the backstory is a bit shoddily written, and occasionally hackneyed. I don't know about you but when I come across references to Merlin or Atlantis in a game book my mind kind of shuts down and I skim past it. If you can weed out the clichés you have a fine enjoyable game on your hands. I love the artwork, much of which is based on Victorian clip art. It's different, but that's not always a bad thing."
5,A Masterpiece!,"Ramsey Lewis' 'Mother Nature's Son' is one of the most important albums of all times. Pianist and arranger Ramsey Lewis plays exclusively themes from the Beatles' 'White Album', and does is magnifically. The orchestral arrangements and conduction by Charles Stepney are incredibly creative. It was recorded in 1968, but will be at least a forever and remarkable work-of-art."
2,What happened Gladys?,"I was very dissapointed when I saw this DVD for the first time. Sound and video are terrible, believe me, terrible.The music is perfect, I love Gladys and Ray, but for me you need a good mix between performance and sound. This is not the case, very old concert and cheap production. Regards"
4,A Very Nice Show!,"I had not seen Gladys and the Pips since the 70's and I wanted a nice video of them in their prime. I was not disappointed! The video picture was not as clear as a more recent show would be but it was more than okay. The audio was very good, I could hear both Gladys and the Pips very well. I enjoyed the show, the selection of songs and the appearance of Ray Charles. I would recommend this video for all video collectors!"
1,Not the Best of Gladys and Ray,"Although this dvd shows Gladys and the Pips in the beginning of their career, I think you should look for a more up to date dvd. By the time Ray started performing with them, it was time to go to sleep. I'd pass this one by."
3,gk@p,early years of gk&p; not at their best.ray charles is ray charles nothing more needs to be said
2,Fantasy to the North Pole,"This video attempts to portray the historic 1994 Arctic Ocean Section Expedition. Unfortunately, some of its most memorable scenes didn't occur when the Canadian and United States icebreakers were around. Neither of the ships witnessed the antics of the talented young children from the Russian Icebreaker Yamal, although they're made virtually the centerpiece of the last half of the video. Frankly the cuts from the children to the scientists trivializes the importance of the work being doen on the expedition for the sake of cuteness.I was a participant in this expedition. It was historic and deserves to be documented accordingly. Unfortunately, this video isn't it."
2,bright sound ?,The sound of the piano is super bright and not really enjoyable to listen too ! ! ! I bought this to sample the sound of the Stuart Piano. I do not know if the over bright sound is characteristic of the Stuart piano or the taste of the recording engineer... I much prefer the sound of Steinway. The music played is wonderful and a good selection of not often played works a good addition to most collections ! !! !
3,rather dim,"not very bright for a 60w, but it you are looking for low lighting, than this is a great buy."
1,Can't figure out how to use this!,I thought this sounded like a good idea when I heard about the benefits on The Dr. Oz show. I tried the orange bulb in my bedroom but it's not bright enough to read by and I don't have any other lamps to use it in. So.... For me it was a waste of $.
4,Bought for promotion preparation,"Needed some guides for promotion preparation. This is one of several that I purchased, and I think all helped a little in different areas.If you have a lot of time to prepare and study (and you always should be preparing for promotion in ANY job) then get as many books & guides as you can. They will help you do better now, and get recognized now. When promotion time comes - you will be ready!"
5,Best of four I purchased,"Dr. Jetmore's book was by far the best of the four books I purchased while prepping for my Lt. exam. The sample written tests are very good. The outline for preperation and early success (start now!) was easy to understand. The Lt. and Capt. assessment center exercises were spot on. I excelled at my depts' pass/fail written test. I know I rocked my assessment center and can't wait to get the results (any week now.) Thank you Dr. Jetmore. Signed, Indy Lt. candidate"
4,very useful guide,I used this book to prepare for a tests and oral boards. I thought it was very straight forward and well organized. The practice tests were also useful. A few of the questions were even on my actual test. I feel it was very helpful in my subsequent promotion.
3,Flawed...,"I just received this book in preparation for an upcoming Lieutenant's test on my department. The book has some very good sections e.g. preparing for the oral interview. It helps the reader avoid some of the common mistakes made during this very crucial step of the promotional process.One issue I immediately noticed was the poor quality of the printing. There are numerous plates with what looks like poorly xeroxed pages. What sturck me first was on the first page of the first chapter, ""The Way of the Path"", the printing is not clean and sharp, the fonts are messy with jagged edges.This is a book that is supposed to help the reader prepare for promotion into the upper management of their Departmant. While the content has the possibility of acheiving that, the lack of attention to detail and the poor printing are just not acceptable."
4,A very pleasing deck to use,"I began with the Original Rider Waite tarot deck and found the colors and thick lines unpleasant. In contrast, this version of the Waite deck is beautiful. The drawings have been retraced in a finer line and the pastel pencil coloring is carefully shaded and very appealing. I think the images looks less cartoonish than in the standard Rider Waite deck. This deck also has a glossy protective coating that looks like it will withstand a lot of use. Overall the Universal Waite is a wonderful deck to use. My one complaint is the packaging is flimsy and it's hard to get the deck back into it. Too bad it doesn't have the same style packaging as the pocket version of the Universal Waite. So, five stars for the deck minus one star for the packaging."
4,Best Rider-Waite deck,"I bought this deck because I wanted to own a Rider-Waite but I didn't like the coloring of the others. This one is very easy on the eyes and I love the backing. I think this is a great deck for beginners and advanced as it let's you read intuitively, yet there are so many books based on this system alone."
4,Handy for travelling,"I love these smaller cards, they are great to pop in your handbag or when travelling anywhere. They are much easier to use for people with small hands who have difficulty shuffling the larger cards."
5,A slight change on tradition,"This deck is the traditional Rider Waite Smith with colour added. That makes for an interesting twist on a traditional deck. I personally do not like all the yellows on the real RWS deck, so this deck is really appealing to me. It has nicer and softer colours, but the images are not changed to toyed with in any way. You get the tradition without the drab colour scheme. I really liked this deck and get a lot of use from it."
4,Nice little deck,"Highly portable, attractive packaging, good quality cards. My only gripe is that the lid can come off pretty easily, and your cards dump all over the floor."
3,"nice, but coloring job not great","I own five versions of the Rider-Waite deck. I don't exactly dislike this interpretation--if you're used to looking at the more standard un-shaded versions, this will bring out details that you might not have noticed before. However, I find the colored pencil work more than slightly irritating. It has the look of having been colored in by an amateur in a coloring book. It isn't a very professional or artistic-looking coloring job. It's not atrocious, but it's not really great, either. The use of colored pencils--especially as applied here--also doesn't ring particularly true to the age in which this deck was originally conceived, nor to what one would imagine were Pamela Coleman-Smith's original intentions."
2,Poor card quality,"My complaint is with the physical quality of the cards. The coating is terrible -- really slippery, and the cardstock feels flimsy. Even the deck box feels like it's about to fall apart.I like the artwork, but invest an extra $2 and get a deck you can actually use."
2,I need new glasses,"What a shame. Got this new deck and opened it eager to enjoy the Roberts color rework. Well, the quality of the printing is atrocious. Fuzzy like nearsightedness. It makes me feel like I need corrective lenses over my corrective lenses. It almost makes me dizzy! I'm gonna try to return this to Amazon. Do not purchase this unless you can find (and inspect) a better printed version.I think I prefer the original Raider Waite.I think I'll stay with the Marseille/Spanish tarot all the way!"
4,"great book, great condition, with one little problem","The book is the one that I am working with my students in. The cover is a different color, and there is a notch taken out of the right hand corner that did not affect the content of the book. Other than that it is a good book, no markings, and very useable."
3,geometry book,The book was not in good condition as stated by the seller. It was fair to poor at best
3,"Sweet gay romance but ""very threatening"" & no subtitles.","This movie comes across as a sweet gay romance. It's fairly easy to follow what's going on and there is an occasional line of dialogue in English. But English subtitles would have helped a lot and I'm a bit disappointed that AMAZON's listing for the movie failed to mention the lack of subtitles.The DVD was also rather annoying because of what seemed like a long 5 minutes' worth of dire threats and warnings (regarding piracy) at the beginning of the DVD with no option or way to navigate away from said threats in order to get to the top menu and/or the beginning of the movie. The usual 5 or 10 second warning I can deal with but the seemingly interminable legalese-type warnings on recent DVD purchases of films from the Philippines are way, way over the top - especially with the DVDs being formatted in such as way that one can't escape all that crap.Still, I very much like Asian gay cinema and was glad to add this to my collection."
5,Nothing Confusing Here: Fun Book,"Dazed & Confused is a classic movie about the day in the life of high schoolers in a small Texas town on last day of school in 1976. This book that is a companion to the movie is just like the movie itself: funny. Designed as part high school yearbook, part 70's era teen magazine, it is a nostalgia filled, quick and enjoyable read. There are tons of pictures (the yearbook pictures of the cast are great) and everyone of the major cast member contributes an ""article"" to the book. If you are a fan of the movie, then this book is a must for your collection."
4,nice,"The lights look very nice. They don't flicker as much but at the same time they are not very bright. They would look better on a tree than how I have them (on my house). The ""crystals"" are the best part, they're unbreakable and fairly spaced closer together than you would think.When you drive around your neighborhood and see super bright LED's they're not like those, they're like the ones that you see that aren't as bright as those. Too bad they don't rate LED's in lumens for strand lights.They're great, just know what you're getting. I'm going to keep putting them on my house since they use up a lot less electricity and they are unique."
1,Why did I bother?,"Literary excrement.An end of the world,Mad Max type story with dinosaurs,Mongol Hordes,Patton,Stonewall Jackson,Amelia Earhart,and God only knows what else thrown in.It's hard to believe that the author didn't intentionally try to write the most absurd End of the world book that he could.(Left Behind,anyone?) Do yourself a favor,do not read this book!Reread the Stand,or Footfall,or Lucifer's Hammer,or Swan Song,but don't waste your time with this drivel."
1,My cat enjoyed this book,"I couldn't stand this book. Someone gave it to me and I still think I paid too much! No plot, horrible writing.Don't be fooled by the cover... The only reason the cover had so many blurbs from great writers is because Robert Gleason was the Editor-in-Chief at Tor books when this was released. They were probably afraid he would stop other authors from giving them blurbs when their new books were coming out since he wielded such ""power.""This book is so bad he couldn't even get it published without throwing his weight around, but funny enough, the publishing company where he worked wouldn't even publish this garbage.STAY AWAY!I'm insulted that this crap ever saw a printing press and ended up in front of my eyes.P.S. I did find it amusing when my cat used the book as kitty litter once when I left it on the floor.Good kitty."
1,Didn't get past page 118. *Snore*,"As a rule I give every book 100 pages to hook me and reel me in. This book barely made it to the cut off, let alone convince me to keep reading. I kept waiting for it to get good because the cover had so many blurbs from great writers! And I love future sci-fi, end of the world stories. But this novel, with the horribly done inclusion of past war heroes, flat characters, lacking scenery descriptions and such... ugh. I gave up. I'd rather re-read excellent novels like ""The Stand"" or ""Battlefield Earth."""
1,Not so sure why people like this book.,"There is absolutely no character development in this novel. If you are going to bring back to life famous people, it would be nice to bring them to life in your narrative. This novel is like a serious Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. But a little less believable than that film. The ""Bad Guy"" is a really BAD GUY and that's pretty much it. If you want well thought out, complex stories of this nature, then I would direct you to the Lost Regiment series by Forstchen or anything by Turtledove. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,This isn't where to go...,"If you want a true guide on how to make women want you sexually, then check out David DeAngelo's EBook Double your Dating or go to [...] The latter is free so I'd recommend that the most. Those are the true resources you should use for how to pick up women. Not this overpriced drivel."
3,Seems a bit pricey for the quality.,"Frankly, I expected more for my money than I got with this book. The quality of the book itself is rather poor considering the price.While I agree with some of the content, there are a few areas that are downright ridiculous. Of course many women want everything... and good luck to them all.Overall, there is good and practical advice to be found here. At a lesser price the book would be a great buy; at the inflated price it's simply a decent buy."
1,"What, I say what were they thinking","I ordered this book with high hopes that the elusive girl over the cube wall would be mine 4ever. When I got home and open the box and finally got my hands on my prized purchase, I couldn't wait for the mysteries to be unlocked. With a one star rating you may already know where the review is going. I tried to follow in Oscar's footsteps but apparently my feet were too small and I got off on the wrong foot. I used the three different angles they laid out and to say it didn't work would be an understatement of epic proportions. Not only did it not work with the hottie over the cube wall but failed with the un-hottie in the mailroom. I can only say that I was devastated by the claim that it would work even for a pathetic guy like me. In closing, I would say that if you're trying to get the girl of your dreams or for that matter a date with a girl in the mail room this is not the book for you."
4,"Good, Solid Advice.","This book is an excellent relationship builder. The basic concept is attracting women by showing interest them as people, not as sex objects. It has a lot of interesting information, such as the best places to meet women, the proper way to hold a converstion, and the importance of having female friends, just to name a few.The only bad thing about this book-- which really isn't a bad thing-- is the cover. I think it can lead guys to believe that this book is about getting quick sex(although the authors do explain at the beginning of the book that their system is not about one-night stands, and that it takes consistent effort to attract women with their method). Again, thats not really a negative thing, it just could've been marketed better.Overall, I thought this book was excellent. It really opened my mind to how women think, and also about building strong friendships and relationships."
3,"Not Magic, but good advice nonetheless","Its not as Revolutionary as the other reviewers are making it out to be, but this book tells you about a pretty logical idea that we dont use in our lives: giving compliments, being compassionate, and reasuring others about their strengths and decisions. It opened my eyes to giving compliments and just chatting with women for the sake of just chatting and not ""picking them up"", but I believe that if not applied properly, you will fall into the ""Nice Guy"" category and be seen as a, well, nice and plain guy - Which is horrible for attraction. I definetly learned a couple of new things, but I was expecting more for my $15."
1,Ummm.........No!,"Im sick and tired of these books stating stuff all of us guys know and have tried and failed at! Every woman huh! I agree theres a ""code"" to getting people to do stuff, but this falls under the heading of NLP, and youd have to master that to achieve the success that this claims it will give you. Dont be too nice(lame), be yourself(but what if your ""too nice"") and just because you arent negative wont make every woman sleep with you, this is just idiocy with a catchy cover and title, man, sometime soon Ive gotta learn a lesson! Im a failure with women and Ive read hypnosis manuals, and all that CRAP, it is useless. Some tips are these, always try and smile, act excited to be around girls and look and act important, like your worth a million even if your worth pennies, and always dress with the ""in"" guys clothing or youll always fail, theres the real answer!"
4,already met 3 women,"I have bought this book on how to make every girl want you. The techniques and concepts are absolutely brilliant and have made me much more confident in my life as a whole, in terms of my profession, ad sales, and in my skills with both men and women, both in business and social situations. I am quite a good looking guy, and have never had problems in finding beautiful women, but have sometimes had difficulty with rapport.I have to say my rapport with women is infinitely easier, i am no longer shy and am able to develop a greater sense of humour with my new found confidence. I have become far more complimentary, far more compassionate and always re-assure both men and women in all situations. In fact within the week that i was reading this book, i had met 3 women i may potentially date."
4,successful ways to be a gentlemen,a successful attempt to classify all that always made real gentlemen different from the rest of men. This book is a hit and actually one of the rare writings for men that benefit women as well. I have to say that I am truly amazed at the information I am getting. Never would I have thought at just how important and true the information in it actually is.
1,Please save yourself the money,"If you want to find a woman , this book will not help you. Spend your money on a woman when you find one , don't waste it here. I don't even know where to start with this book. They mention about how rich , famous and good looking men get 90% of the women. What is your main goal in selling this book John? Steve? I guess they're trying to get into one of the three categories. A little ironic. Anyway , they mention in this book about a guy named Oscar and how he gets all the women. Save yourself some money. You don't need to buy this book to learn that you have to listen to women. Any idiot knows that.In short , i haven't bought this book and i recommend everyone to follow my actions and stay FAR away from it."
2,The information can turn against you if,"This book contains some useful information. But if you don't use it wiselly you can became a Nice Guy and you are not going to get a girlfriend, date, night stand whatever. If you don`t know how to treat women as friends the information is ok, but if you want a male female interaction this book can easyly mislead you. Buy another book, there are plenty of then much better than this, even those that are sold as e-books."
1,next!,"I have bought alot of books in this area, this was one of the worst. Befriend women, and hope they may like you, or introduce you to their friends.The title is very misleading ""Make Every Girl Want You"".They only suggest talking to girls a parties, or classes. That is not every girl. They tell you talking to girls you don't know will never work.The book should be renamed to ""Having a Successful Friendship with girls"". The picture should have a girl with cankles and gradma panties dropping.(...)"
1,Make every girl NOT want you with this book,"This was the worst book I have ever read in my life. If there was a 0 stars, then I would definitely give it to this book. I really got scammed, and you will too if you buy this book. It is filled with tons of fluff and 1 concept called CCR. The concept is horrible though, because WOMEN DO NOT LIKE NICE GUYS!!! Women like to have fun, not be around some needy, desperty, wanty guy who is trying to give meaning to his life by getting a girl.I tried contacting the people who wrote this several times, and they did respond to any of my emails. Please do not get scammed like I did."
3,If you don't get it..buy it,"There was nothing in this book that I did not know already...I get it...Good book for guys that do not really understand women and want help improving their relationships...to compliment this book I suggest reading ""How To Talk To Anyone"" by Leil Lownders it will take your communication skills to a whole new level"
4,Nice deck for anyone,"The pictures are nice without being fluffy or cutsey. I love how all the Aces are animals, a kingfisher, a horse, a stag, etc. This really is a deck for anyone, but I think those with a love of Fairies and nature would really enjoy it, or children. No scary images!Yet this is not a light deck, I have done some serious readings with mine and got in depth answers. I feel it would be excellent to use to read for children, or pets. My pet readings were very clear and accurate."
5,guitarguy,This is an incredible little package! This is two hundred dollars worth of private lessons for less than what it would cost for one lesson. Nice supplemental booklet that gives you plenty to feast on. Selections are very professionally done and more fun than a room full of monkeys to play with. Very nice little starter riffs and licks to get you going and plenty of scales to guide you.
3,Modern Blues Jamtrax for Guitar,"This book is fun, there is no doubt about that. However, as an educational tool for blues guitar, it would not be my first recommendation. The price is right and that is what give it my third star."
3,good and bad,"the good thing is these are great songs to jam to if you understand pentatonics and modes and how to use them. the bad thing is the licks and scales they show you are not recorded on the cd, so therefore you have to know how to read music to understand how the lick is suppose to sound. It does have tab but tab doesn't show you how long to hold each note."
2,underpowered....,Sounds like some very tired and uninspired studio musicians. Save your money and buy something else!
5,Barbie color pixter fashion show cartridge,My little girl who is 4 loves her color pixter and has alot of fun with this cartridge. She is able to figure everything out for herself as far as how to play the different things the cartridge has to offer. She plays with this Barbie one EVERYDAY and with those of us with 4 year olds know that's a big deal
3,Slogging through mud...,"I like the ideas in this book and think that the author has presented history professionals with plenty of research about how students and teachers interpret what they learn in their history courses. That said, I don't find this book to be particularly well written. Maybe it's just me, but getting through some of the essays was like slogging through mud... obscure language, lousy sentences, and paragraphs weighed down by too many words. I think most of the essays in this book could have been parred down to two or three pages a piece. So, Sam can think, but he writes like a graduate student who says in fifty words what could be said in ten. In fact, I think I can distill the book down to one (long)sentence: ""We can't view or interpret what happened in the past accurately because we weren't there and are too affected by the present; therefore, looking back in time is at best like ""looking through a glass darkly."""
5,great read,Great analysis...provides a lot of good insight on teaching history and developing historical thinking within students. I would definitely recommend this for any educator.
2,Overrated,"Often when a book is cited as fundamental to other writers' thinking, this is a convincing endorsement.This book was overrated. I was quite disappointed. Too little substance for the number of paeons received.A professor would be better off to have students read academic journal articles."
1,this is not a laptop,"this is not a computer,feel free to contact me with details about the low quality of this computer..."
3,"Good book, not as specific for model as I needed","Overall the book is good, but for a service manual it is not a specific for the problem that I needed to identify. I have(had) a bellows problem, and it could not identify which part I needed. I finally figured it out, but the purchase of the book was to identify the problem. Its an older boat, but sat too long between launchings. Be sure of parts and part numbers before ordering to get the right part the first time, as they can be very expensive."
4,great game,"This game is pretty entertaining, not so scary at least for me but more surprising. I like it more than Resident Evil games though, and it's a good game overall."
5,"Not Silent Hill, But Very Original","I didn't know what to expect from this game initially, all I knew up until I bought the game yesterday was that it was from the creators of the original Silent Hill. I must say that I am not disappointed. Think Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid with a nice dose of Japanese culture and mysticism and that's as close as I can get to describing this game. I like the survival horror-stealth concept that this game presents. It's definetely original and I think this game will do well. If you lack the ability to be patient I suggest steering away from this one. It's primarily brains and not brawn. If you want a suspenseful experience this is the way to go."
4,Un poco torpe para los movimientos...,La historia muy interesanteLa psicologia d terror muy buenaLos movimientos del personaje q uno lleva es bastante torpeMas sin embargo es un buen juego d terror q saca sustos a cualquiera...
3,A REVIEW ACTUALLY EXPLAINING WHAT THE GAME IS LIKE,"Ok how this game works. its like a horror puzzle game. You get a special feature that allows u to have vision of the enemies around you. You must find your way through the forest trying to use the vision specialty you have, and try not to get seen by the enemies. Its in 3rd person with quite good graphics for a ps2 title. All characters have many many different facial expressions and the lighting effect is amazing. Its a cool idea, but its not a free roaming game such as resident evil, or fatal frame. It would be the scariest of all horror games if it was free roaming. Currently i am on the 3rd lvl or mission. It may change to free raoming later, but so far it is not. Its a cool idea, and i may end up liking it better than i do now. Any questions im me on aim at kilik327 or yahoo messenger at ujio_last_samurai"
2,"Not scary, not spectacular, just original","Basics:The graphics are horrible.Controls are poorly designed.Voice acting sucks!Additional:There is not much of a scare factor here, only frustration at numerous loading screens.The monsters, they never die! Oh dear God, please save us!Seriously, though:This game is no fun. You will waste a good portion of your time discovering this fact of reality."
3,Eh,This game was decent and pretty good I suppose. The graphics were horrible though! And all the characters had British accents...I didnt mind that but Japanese people with British accents got kinda annoying after sometime. The plot was freaky enough ^_^. I found it hard to get very far in this game the Shibito kept killing me. Overall this game is a good buy for Horror Survival game fanatics like myself. But you will need the guide or you will get lost!
2,for those with alot of patience,"Sony gave it a good try but the game is too frustrating. The story begins with part of the Japanese landscape gone to Hell. The population has been turned into killer zombies called Shibito and you have to survive and find out what happened to the town. You can ""Sightjack"" so you can see through the eyes of the shibito, which is pretty scary, but you really don't care because as soon as your starting to get emotionally invested with your character you switch to another one. The accents do not fit the characters, and the color palettes used in the game a very drab looking. Be prpared to die and restart alot. Silent Hill 3, The Suffering, and Fatal Frame 2 are better choices."
2,You REALLY NEED a CodeBreaker to play this one!,"And even WITH a Codebreaker, it's STILL DIFFICULT! But, you won't die every 5 minutes with the codebreaker enabled. The zombie sounds ARE C*R*E*E*P*Y. But, The Suffering, has the EXACT ""undead"" fx as Siren??! I think Siren is just the japanese version of The Suffering. But, The Suffering is MUCH faster gameplay. I've had Siren for 3 days, I played for 48 mins. on day I received it. By day 3, I'm STILL on ""Day One"" of trying to get the main characters to the highway out of zombieville. I'm stuck on what I believe, is the final ""main"" character>>""Gramps""(as i refer to him. he's 70 yrs. old). I can't find the stinking tool to smash open the gate for him to meet the others at the ""highway""! And I'm using the Codebreaker with it!!! URGHHHHHHH! I;m GLAD, I DIDN'T pay the $49.99 original list price for this game!!!!!!"
1,"if you're looking for horror, be wary of this game","""Siren"" is advertised as a horror game. It has some of the superficial features of horror, but the gameplay isn't creepy at all. It's a stealth game. There's plenty tension, but no horror. I was disappointed. Maybe ""Siren"" is a good stealth game, but if you're looking for a new horror game with a good story & especially with a creepy ambiance, I recommend against it."
2,Good concept done wrong,"I picked up this game thinking it was going to be great. It looked like a Silent Hill rip off, which I have nothing against. I was wrong. I can basicly sum things up for you in point form.- Worse controls then RE and Silent Hill put together- Way to diffacult. Confusing while moving around.- Zombies with guns...- heavy Japanese setting may turn people off- Storyline that makes no sense- After you play the game for a while, you are forced to reply all the levels again. That's when I quit."
2,"DONT BE STUPID, DONT BUY","This game is a very bad horror game. Its controls are terrible and when you kill zombies, they come back up, no way to kill them. An interesting plot but confusing as hell in the begining. I wasted 40 bucks on this game, dont do the same, wait till it hits bargain baskets. THIS GAME IS SUPER DIFFICULT AND ANNOYING. My friend and I played one level for over 2 hours when it was a 20 minute level, we kept dying. No grenades or machine guns. Just a revolver, poker (yes a fireplace poker), a wrench, and a pilgrim gun. The zombies in this are amazing marksman with thier sniper rifles, which seems f*cking stupid to me. anyways, if u wanna waste ur time/money, buy this. if not, buy silent hill or resident evil 4 (amazing game!!!!)"
1,it's not worth the style.,"it's a gmae of a kind, like fatal frame made it's ownstyle.but this is a""manual labor - countryside espionage action horror game""nothing more nothing less.go try it at a friends house .dont waste your money.i give 1star because it has style."
1,Ruined by lack of Japanese language audio track.,"How can you have a game where all the characters are Japanese, the setting is Japan, and yet have all the characters speak in U.K. English with U.K. accents? Talk about spoiling a great thing. Siren 2 is supposed to be on the horizon, and hopefully the game's makers will come to their senses and include the Japanese audio track for all releases. It could have been right up there with Silent Hill, but instead the realism, and thus the intensity and scary factor, is lessened because of the lack of a Japanese audio track, which could have been easily included since this game was released in Japan with such an audio track. Those responsible for releasing this in America must have made a major mental lapse -- I hope so, because if they actually sat down and thought of some ""reasons"" to not include the original language track, then there's simply no excuse, no justification. Ridiculous, just plain ridiculous."
1,long and boring,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.I DONE THAT MISTAKE AND REGRET IT.IF YOU WANT A GAME UNDER THAT STYLE BUY SILENT HILL,ANY TITLE IS GREAT."
4,"Good, solid game.","This is a good, solid horror game. The gameplay does however get repetitive, but other than that, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror games, and definantly to anyone who likes a challenge. It's a very difficult game but I found that not giving up helps to beat it. All the mission have simple objectives, but there's ALWAYS a challenge. This isn't an action packed game, but it will sure get your heart bumpin'."
3,"original, scary & difficult","This game is so intelligently crafted - and if you love getting scared, you should definitely get this. The fear factor really gives Siren its edge - but prepare to devote a lot of playtime for this one."
5,Floral Stitching explored,"This is an excellent book. It provides you with many choices of stitched flowers both in silk ribbon and threads and yarns. FOr those who admire the intricate stitching and motifs that are original to crazy quilting this book will set you well on your way to adding many of interesting stitched florals to your blocks. It is a well done book, very good instructions , easy to understand and truly inspirational. I have read many cq books and find this the best one.Not only does it give you the basics you need to get started adding wonderful embroidery to your quilting but it inspires you to adventure out and try your own designs.This book is well suited to the beginner and the experienced stitcher who wants to add new techniques and ideas to your quilted pieces."
4,Floral Stitches,"Enjoyed ""reading ""this book. It has a monogram section that I used several times and was always pleased with the result."
4,good prik pao,I am used to eating tons and tons of thai chili paste and powders..this one was on the sweeter side but highly enjoyable and one of the best you can get out there. Importfood has the best deal too!
3,Comfortable and stinky,Positive: These shoes are very comfortable and don't rub the foot wrong at all. They are simple and cute.Negative: The material is definitely cheap and it crinkles easily (kind of like wrapping paper with shiny cloth over it). The shoes smell terrible and I don't know how to get the smell out of them. No arch support.
4,Good for those who want an idea of what it is,"I got it for my family. As usual, there's a few mistakes and the school has changed a little since 2000, but this DVD is pretty good for giving the jist of what Ranger School is."
5,A most excellent read,"An excellent well reserched book. As a military and aviation history buff I found this book to be extremely interesting. this book not only covers the battle itself, but all (Pan-Americans role,the construction companies, legislative and diplomatic activities) other events leading up to it. About two years ago I spent two weeks on the island, looking around and doing some exploring; this book really filled in my knowlegde of the island and put things in perpective."
4,Great book!!,"I had already read the ""Gien up for Dead"" by Bill Sloan and found it to be very good as well. I just wanted someone eles' opinion and story about Wake Island. Both are a little slow in the beginning, but well worth the read.Anyone interested in WW2 history and the Pacific Battle, these books tell a story that is not very commonly told."
5,An Excellent Overview of The System...,"Highly recommanded for an insight of how American politics funtions. Although this small book only skims the surface, it covers a broad range of major issues - slavery, civil rights, prohibition, all notable Presidents - and gives you an understanding how politics works, in the United States. Including the Constitution, and Bill of Rights, this book will date itself however, by discussing the two main parties most likely candidates for Nov 2000."
1,Item was slightly sweeter to the standard Glucerna that my folks get.,Item was slightly sweeter compared to the standard Glucerna that my folks get. If you enjoy a sweeter milk then I suggest this is for you.
1,"Bad Listing, BEWARE","There is no such chip as an AMD Athlon 64 Processor FX 70 125 WATT AM2. It is a socket F with 1207 pins, not 940 socket AM2 as the ad banner describes. Don't be mislead into believing this is the next chip in the FX Athlon series after the incredible FX 62. It was an interim chip produced before the Quad core chips came out. The only motherboard I can find for it comes from Asus (Even they don't guarantee compatability since the board was designed for an Opteron.) To realize a performance increase over the Athon 6400+, you will need two CPU's, otherwise even the Athon 6000 out performs just a single chip. I do not believe any other board manufacturers are planning boards for this chip. There are ads all over the internet for the AMD Athlon 64 Processor FX 70 125 WATT AM2, but none of them clearly indicate that this chip is a socket F. I believe there is a lot of inventory out there and this misleading banner is just an attempt to unload an expensive orphaned chip."
1,Don't waste your money and time,No useful information. Poorly written. Not worth your time or money. There are many other far better books on this subject.
4,Good Book!,"This was a well written, interesting book. It is about two people who start out in totally different circumstances. The first time they see each other, she is a half gypsy girl with a deformed hand, that is going home with the father she had just met. He is a boy that is going to prison, who had just seen his father brutally murdered. This was a well written book, with a few surprises in the story line that keeps you reading. The explanation they give for palm reading is very interesting. When they finally do get together, they have some trials and tribulations that they must deal with. I haven't read many of King's books, but I will be looking for them now. Enjoy!"
5,A wonderful love story,Susan King is a story teller par excellence and The Heather Moon only proves this true! Don't miss this incredible tale and its most memorable characters
5,Susan King does it again!,"No one writes Scotland better than Susan King. She does a flat-out marvelous job of weaving history, romance, and adventure into a terrific read. Her Gypsies seem like real Gypsies, not the romanticized Hollywood variety. Her books also use metaphysical elements in an appealing, unpretentious way. Best of all, her characters are people I can like and respect, not arrogant jocks and brainless twits. Tamsin and William are both winners."
1,"Not worth even $10, if you need something like this you can make your own","I purchased this at the same time I did two Therma-Rest large self-inflating sleeping pads. At the time I was concerned about the pads moving or separating under our Queen size sleeping bag. However, after trying it out at home, we ended up not even taking this thing on our trip. It is simply some flimsy strapping material with a few buckles. I can't imagine the buckles feel comfortable under the sleeping pad ... and the whole thing is only minimally effective, if at all. My advice ... try things out without any strapping first. If you really find there to be a problem with the pads moving and separating at night ... try some duct tape, string ... or anything else you can think of. But we honestly did not experience any discomfort from minor sleeping pad ""creep"" during the night. Save your money."
4,These do what they are supposed to.,"We bought the these straps when we bought our Therm-a-rest pads. It took practice putting them on, make sure to fasten the ladder buckles properly so they don't slip. The buckle fits near the edge of the mattress and we don't even know it is there. The only thing I didn't like is the way the storage bag is attached. These straps do work."
4,OK CD-NOT HIS BEST,"THIS CD IS OK--NOT AS GOOD AS ..COMO TE EXTRANO.SONGS WHICH ARE WORTH BUYING THE CD ARE:SUFRIRAS(CUMBIA,TEX-MEX)ESTOY ENAMORADO.IF YOU LIKE THIS ARTIST,OK TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION,AFTERALL,PETE HAS A VERY GOOD VOICE AND DIFFERENT SOUND IN MEXICAN MUSIC."
2,The True Subject (Lockert Library of Poetry in Translation),"A good effort at translating Faiz, but seems bogged down too often in the literal translation of language as well as emotions. I've seen some translations of the same poems by others (Riz Rahim in The Guardian, UK) that seem to better capture the thought, emotion, and the lyrical quality of Faiz. Maybe the difference that a native Urdu speaker, perfectly at ease in English makes."
2,It could have been so much better!,"It started out very good, but I think the best way to describe this book is a rough draft, a skeleton for a much better epic. I loved the actual plot, but everything was very obvious, naked almost, because there was nothing else EXCEPT the basic plot. Nothing on how the girls at Midnight Mother's lived, nothing on her friendships--only Dilara's, as a plot device, seems to be important--nothing on her life at college, nothing on her life at Seven Springs--not even a HINT of the fighting styles she used, what weapons they used, anything that wouldjust keep us interested! It was just a bare plot, bereft of anything that could truly make the plot twist. It was so obvious in fact that all of the major plot twists in the story, save one, are predictable.It's almost sad, too, because the plot is very good and would have been very interesting. This could have been an epic, such as The Light Bearer or Kushiel's Dart, but reduced to an almost childlike rough draft."
2,sniff sniff,"Fab idea for a book - love the assasin story and the lost orphan bit. I also love the use of language to express light, surroundings and scenery but then it disintegrated into hogwash!Why S.D. Tower? Why? Sooo not cool yo!"
2,Put the book back on the shelf,"When the autho ir using an alias to publish a book, that's usually a bad sign.The main plot point of a hidden assassin/sly school for young girls could have been made much more interesting, or even more campy. But it's just dull, there's no challenges or struggles at the school, it's just the first 100 pages of backstory.This book is little more than a travelogue, alwys events are happening yet there's very little reflection or introspection by the characters. Things just happen. Pages are given to boring history details, and political plotting.I skipped 200 pages of this book just to the ending and didn't miss a beat. Especially since the main character mentions what's going on every four or five pgaes.I'm glad I'm done with it."
4,"A very enjoyable read, but......","The heroine in this book is caught in a plot and vise like grip of destiny (albeit planned by human hands) that rivals any of the Greek and Shakespearian characters. The author laid the ground work and created an atmosphere of impending doom with skill and leads the reader along with the heroine relentlessly into an abyss from where there seemed to be no scape. Unfortunately, at least in this reader's opinion, that's the point where this story and the Greek tragedies parted ways.I'm sure the way this particular plot was concluded will satisfy most readers, because in many sense, it was what is expected to happen. Yet I can't help thinking that if the author had concluded the story in the path and spirit of the classic tragedies, this perhaps could have been a great book, instead of just a good one. Having said that, I would like to emphasize that I still enjoyed the book immensely."
3,Could Have Been Better,"I would agree with the other reviewers. This book is worth a read. It had really great potential and could have been superb. Instead it is merely OK. Unlike many of my books, like the Hawk and Fisher series by Simon R. Green, this book probably won't stand up to repeated reading. There just aren't the subtle little details that can be discovered through multiple reads. Plus, I would have liked more depth to the character's lives, including that of Lale. Tell me more about Dilara's past. Tell me a little more about Tossi, who is a cardboard cutout hardline believer. What was her past like? How did she come to be the first assasin? What kinds of poisons did they learn to make? Vegetable, animal or mineral? How could Lale not have thought to look into her parentage at all? The explanation is lacking.This book is OK, but it could have been so much more."
2,Way too frothy,Way too frothy. Makes one gassy due to the excessive amount of bubbles. Taste is just ok.
1,worthless,this stuff did nothing and my cats did not like it. I gave it to them anyway and thet did eat it but ate less than normal. Absolutely cannot tell any difference in teeth or gums since they have been eating it .
4,Dog teeth,"Very easy to use. Dogs don't even realize that they are consuming something ""good"" for them. Not sure if it really works, but worth a try."
4,"whiter teeth, healthier teeth","I bought this to help clean tarter off of my dogs teeth, I have a friend who has used it with her dogs andtheir teeth are in great condition. I have been using it for 3 weeks and it is working, I am very excitedabout the product."
1,Dentatreat review,I used this product for 9 months with no positive results. My dogs teeth were actually worse using this product.
4,A wonderful book for beginners,This book provides a comprehensive discussion and integration of career development theories. The instructor's manual assists the beginning professor with an opportunity to impart quality pedagogical knowledge to students. The examples cited throughout the text offer students an opportunity ingest the course material and retain their newly found knowledge. The author makes learning career theories enjoyable and very applicable to situations.
2,"voluminous info, not well organized, not well explained, almost outdated","Since theory always starts with the historical psychological causes of problems, this book is not really about theory, it's really about how to help individuals find a better future, not how to correct the causes of unemployment, underemployment or job dissatisfaction. Voluminous information, numerous psychometric scales and variables, not well defined and explained, and some explanations are off quite a ways. Examples are shallow and cold, not a model of how to be a professional, expert career counselor. Good books on career development theory are hard to find, especially given the changing world we live in. Hopefully there will be a text that comes out in the direction of ""Adaptable Careers: Maximizing Less and Exploring More"" by Annelies E M van Vianen, Irene E De Pater, Paul T Y Preenen from The Career Development Quarterly (June 2009, 57-4, pp 298-309)."
2,Help keep that Stud away from your B*tch,Says Fits 11 to 20 lb dog....... although it did fit my 14 lb B*tch it is very difficult to put on.... that's my only complaint otherwise it's beneficial when your B*tch is in heat
4,IS TIGHT,"I think this disco is good because it has song like trono caido, vete con el, cielo, corazon de piedra. But It's good couse Lalo Mora is still with them I give it 4 stars."
2,Painful to listen to,"I give this CD 2 stars only because it includes a nice instrumental version of Canon in D. Other than that, the singing is atrocious. I didn't realize that some of the songs are performed by this woman's children, and although it's probably really cute to listen to your own baby sing ""twinkle twinkle little star,"" listening to someone else's baby ""sing"" it is NOT cute and I certainly would NOT have paid money for it had I known what I was getting myself into. I had hoped this would be a wonderful CD of lullabies that I could play for my baby in the car or at bedtime, but alas, it is an instrument of torture for parents and children alike. There is absolutely nothing precious about it."
5,Excellent translation with helpful introduction and notes!,"Although originally published in 1938, this is still one of the best translations of the Analects of Confucius. Waley also has an extensive and informative introduction, plus some helpful notes. Other good translations of the Analects include those by D.C. Lau and James Legge."
5,Great Item,This item that I purchased was in a very good condition. It is a great book and I would recommend it for someone else.
2,The footnotes will kill ya.,"This is, perhaps, the dryist, most obvious (i.e., the golden rule) philosophy you'll ever read, and the non-stop footnotes adorning almost every sentence will make you want to throw this book out the nearest window."
3,A clear introduction to a complicated story,Ms. Litton has succeeded in delivering a concise yet readable and affecting story of a very complicated event. This un-biased presentation enumerates the many individuals and organizations who could have done more to help and didn't. The journal excerpts and illustrations succeed in bringing to life the personal tragedies and inhumanity of the times. Ms. Litton explains enough of the politics involved so that you understand the context of the events but not so much that the human aspects of the tragedy are lost. In the end she whets your appetite for more.
2,Sent different color then shown on picture,"I ordered 3 reading glasses 4 days ago with expedited shipping, arrived fast. But they send me 1 black (as shown in picture) and 2 in gold color (!) which is neither on the picture nor that you can choose a color nor that they inform you about sending other colors. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning them. They just don't care! Very disappointed !"
3,"For women who are ""foreign"" to business","This is a very good GENERAL overview of going into business. It is not for women (or men) who are familiar with business. For example, having an MBA, I was hoping for this book to go into more depth on many of the topics. It briefly discusses different business entities, but does not offer any help on how to go about setting up your business entity. It does discuss business expenses (not in very much detail), which was helpful.It is good if you consider yourself ""clueless"" when it comes to running your own business and need some general help. You may be disappointed if you have already have some businesss knowledge."
5,Product as described!,"Fast shipping, item condition as described. The book has great content, it is easy to understand and was totally worth my investment. I would recommend the book for start-ups and entrepreneurs."
4,Very Informative,If You Want To Know The Full History Of Christmas. This Is The DVD For You. Highly Recommended. Merry Christmas
2,"4"" spatula --","The metal used for the blade of the spatula is so limp that it is essentially useless. The blade bends at the slightest use, such as trying to spread whipped, softened butter. The blade has no strength to it. I'm surprised that the CIA allows their name on a product of such poor quality. The handle does fit comfortably in the hand, but they need to improve the quality of the metal used for the blade."
2,Subpar Offering,"I just have a different take on this I guess. I generally like the other books by this author that I've read. This one was really bogged down by what I thought were some ridiculous, cliched descriptions. The author's prose was more overheated than chicken noodle soup left in the microwave for an hour (if you see the point I'm trying to make). Descriptions of characters' interior life were often arbitrary and I didn't feel there was a basis for their actions at times. When the identity of the kidnapper was revealed, I thought it made no sense and the foundation was not there; again arbitrary and a bit of a narrative cheat.I wouldn't want to try to do all the varied characters voices, that having been said, I thought the reading did the author no favors. Too many of the voices were rather ""over the top"" in terms of accents.Overall, a frustrating experience. I managed to hang on because I wanted to see what ultimately happened."
5,High Energy!,"This group of young people continue to amaze me. They captured the energy and power of their live performance on this recording. My favorites are ""Have Faith"", ""Dynamic Praise"", and my very favorite....""Faith In Me"". The central theme of this project is faith....I'm encouraged all the more to trust and have faith as a result of the ministry of Dynamic Praise. Thanks yall!"
3,Very traditional,"if you enjoy traditional quiltmaking and applique you will enjoy this book. Personally, I bought it specifically for the halloween appliques shown on the back cover. The quilt designs are not terribly original but some of the applique is quite creative. It is an average quilt book but has some nice ideas."
5,Great Bra.,I was recently introduced to Goddess Bras. They are fantastic. The middle underwire stays tacked to your body instead of sticking out of your clothes. Very comfortable. The only thing about this bra which haven't experienced from other goddess bras is the straps squeak where they are adjustable. I expect that will go away after the first wash. I highly recommend Goddess Bras to any woman.
4,It works despite what the experts say.,"I have been eating low fat foods for years and my weight increased yearly. I followed the advice in this book and my weight has been decreasing for the first time in years,while my fat intake has increased. I can understand why nutritional experts have their doubts about this book. It certainly doesn't follow the conventional wisdom, and the authors give little scientific evidence that it works other than testimonials.I started losing weight painlessly and immediately on this diet. I don't count calories or fat grams and don't even worry much about protion size. There has to be something to it."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"In a word: Terrible.As a professional test chef, I try the recipes of many books for our tv network. In my years of experience, I have never tested a work of propaganda like this one.The recipes are ponderous and even worse, inaccurate. Measurements are unbalanced and cooking times simply incorrect. Also, never having received my M.D., I can barely understand the recipes. Finally, unless you have a professional kitchen, some of these recipes are insurmountable.Stay away from this highly suspect collection of ""recipes."" If this was the last cookbook on earth, I would eat PB&J."
1,What a load of bunk!,"There's an unbelievable amount of distortion of medical facts in this book. There is also some good advice. Yes insulin is an important physiological factor in gaining weight and high glycemic-sugary-foods trigger this hormone,but the overal gestalt of this book is pretty much mass media nonsense. High carbohydrate diets ,when composed correctly, are incontestably the most healthful of all diets. We have about four fifths of the human race to verify that. The bottom line is:IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT,EAT LESS. There's no magic about it. The lazy crowd will forever be in search of tne magic,effortless formula. Hence, the popularity of this book."
1,not a healthy way to eat for life,"Speaking as a Type II diabetic, insulin intolerance is caused by obesity, not the other way around and you would think an endocrinologist and a cardiologist would know this. This is not a program a person can or should stay on for the rest of his/her life--although a couple of weeks probably wouldn't hurt too badly. However, how have they eliminated the problem of ketosis and kidney problems that high protein, low carbohydrate, ""low fat"" (programs that encourage lots of red meat and nuts and nut butters aren't really low fat and aren't easily digestible by those people without gall bladders) generally cause? Or have those problems been eliminated?"
3,Lose because of less calories,"I followed this diet for about 6 months. It was hard for me to eat the foods since I'm at college and I didn't have many choices. I lost 20 lbs, though. I'm so proud that I actually lost the weight but I have to say that I think the only reason I lost the weight was because I ate less. I just consumed less calories because I didn't have as many things to eat. I don't know why I could follow this diet more than I could other diets...it could have just been the point I was in my life. So, in other words, I think that if you wanna lose weight, the bottom line is that you have to reduce caloric intake and be motivated. Maybe this diet will be the one you can follow too, but you could also save some money and just try to not eat as much and decide if this is the time that you're ready to dedicate your time and motivation to this life-altering task."
5,It's a pleasure to give this book a great review,"Several months ago, as I was feeling completely at the mercy of tight clothes and rising numbers on the scale, several friends told me about the Atkins Diet and Protein Power. I did some research on the internet and concluded that I didn't think I could live with either of those plans. I stumbled onto the Sugar Busters book in the process and purchased it from Amazon. I started Sugar Busting on 6/6/01 and have lost 16 pounds so far. I do not have those same panicked, shaky feelings if I'm not consuming food all the time. When I'm hungry, it's an *awareness* that I'm empty and need filling. It took a week of feeling kind of lousy while following the program, and since then, I have never felt better. This is a way of eating that I can live with forever. I'm sure I've become an annoying evangelical Sugar Buster but I tell everyone I know (whether they have weight to lose or not) to try Sugar Busters for two weeks and see if they don't feel better."
5,Sugar Busters Cut Sugar to Trim Fat,"I was impressed with how easy this material was to absorb. The book immediately got me excited about making changes that not only made my body feel better but also took the weight off. I have never felt like I'm ""not dieting"" before until this book. Kudos to the authors.. My life has changed and this book helped make it possible."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I actually bought this book when it first came out but now want everyone to know that it doesn't work for PERMANENT weight loss. I dropped some weight and then it came back on and I got so depressed! I finally did end up losing my weight for good, but it was with a book by Gary Rempe."
1,not what I thought it would be,I ordered this book thinking it was the complete version with recipes and diet. It was not! Only had do's and don'ts about choosing No Sugar foods.
5,"VERY INFORMATIONAL, BUT HARD TO BELIEVE I CAN EAT PEANUT BUT","I WISH I COULD ASK THESE DOCTORS A FEW QUESTIONS THAT WERE NOT ANWSERED IN THE BOOK. LIKE, IS IT OK TO HAVE A PIECE OF TOAST W/PEANUT BUTTER (WHOLE GRAIN TOAST ) AND A BOWL OF POST SHERREDEDWHEAT CEREAL. THEN FOR LUNCH HAVE 1 SLICE OF WHOLE WHEAT BREAD? THEN FOR DINNER HAVE A SWEET POTATO? IS THAT TOO MUCH OF A ""GOOD"" THING? I DO INCLUDE OTHER FOODS ALONG WITH THE FOODS MENTIONED ABOVE, WHICH ARE LOW INDEX FOODS."
3,Sugar Busters v. Adtkins,"After trying both diets, Sugar Busters and Adtknis, I found that Adtkins had better results for me. Just a little sugar, even the non processed kind that Sugar Busters allowed sent my sugar cravings right to the roof. No Tasykake was safe in my prescence. I found that without any sugar as recommended by Adtkins, I lost more weight and didn't ""cheat"" as much."
2,"Good idea, badly done","i zipped through this book in an afternoon. it's a good idea but you'd think between 4 guys they could have done a better job. it should be called the diet for rich middle age men who aren't vegetarians. there is very little guidance on how to shop on this diet, or how to order in a restaurant. and what about how to read a nutritional label? also, how about side effects? personally i have lost some weight on this diet but i am always dizzy, tired, bloated and have trouble focusing. i noticed reading other reviews that i'm not the only one having problems. where's that promised energy boost? i think the authors have a responsibility to tell the entire spectrum of how people react to this diet, not just the self promoting cases."
5,I F E E L GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been on Sugar Buster's for about 3 weeks and I really feel GOOD! I cannot believe ridding my diet of sugar and starches can make this much difference, but it has. I have energy for the first time in three years. This is the first eating plan that makes sense to me. I do not feel that I am giving up anything! I am not craving sugar or starches like I use to."
5,GREAT IDEA! SUGAR IS THE PROBLEM!,"My brother recently died of a heart attack and complications from diabetes. I know that I am on the same path if I do not change my ways of eating. I just bought this book and I really feel that eliminating sugar from my diet would be fantastic but I always get cravings. I am going to start though and I will post my results in a month. If anyone has encouragement for me, please feel free to E-mail me at the address listed. I would love to hear how anyone overcame their cravings and if you really have to give up morning caffinated coffee. I hope this works..."
4,Ignore the AHA Hype. Read The Book,"Please ignore the American Heart Association's characterazation of Sugar Busters as a high protein fad diet. I serously doubt that anyone with any medical training at the AHA even read this book. They probably thought it was a rehash of the Atkins Diet. It is not. Sugar Busters is a common sense approach to weight loss. I had been on a low fat diet for years which resulted in high trigylcerides, high fasting glucose and low HDL cholestorol. I was still 20 pounds overweight even running 25 miles a week. Within 6 weeks of starting sugar busters I raised my HDL cholestorol 20 mg/dl and lower my triglycerides to 101 and my fasting glucose to normal levels. Unfortunately it was too late as I had developed cataracts in both eyes at only age 46. I have lost the 20 pounds and at the same time cut a total of 10 minutes off my 5 mile run. The sad truth is low fat diets are making a lot of people sicker. I was one of them."
2,Not practicle for the average person,"I bought this book on the advise of my sister-in-law who swears by it, and frankly I find it terribly inconvenient. First of all, its so detailed that it bored me to [tears]. Second, I had to purchase the companion book and take it shopping with me because its just too hard to remember what you can and cannot eat on this program. I found that my local grocery store didn't carry alot of the products on the suggested eating lists, so I was forced to search the health food stores, which was very expensive. After a few weeks it became so impracticle that I gave up."
1,not eating certain fruits & vegies is just plain dumb,"Im sorry but I am a big vegie eater......and love fruit......no bananas? Also the book gives you no lists, you have to read the book and make lists. I was on the diet for one month..not one single pound........"
1,"Too complicated, bad science; try Dr. Ornish instead","Weight gain and loss has to do with calories consumed and calories burned. People who try to make it more complicated and who, like these folks, try to get you convinced that meat is good for you and carrots and apples are bad for you should be relegated to the humor section. These guys tell you low-fat diets don't work; as someone who has just lost 41 pounds and 6 inches around my waste on a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, I can tell you they are as full of baloney as they come."
2,Hard to stick to,"While this diet may be good for some people, I found it very hard to follow. The foods I love best are not allowed. I found myself CRAVING the ""forbidden"" food when I never had before. I am also concerned about how healthy a diet it really is."
2,Book doesn't tell the whole story,"This book makes a great claim to be the ""utopia"" of weight loss plans. However, it doesn't tell the whole truth. I have tried the diet for about four days now. Yesterday I came down with a low grade headache and became grouchy. Pain relievers that normally work wouldn't stop the headache. By the wee hours of this morning I was feeling very weak. By noon today I was feeling dizzy, light-headed, and thinking I was coming down with the flu. All these symptoms went away immediately when I ate a pack of M&M's. The book said nothing about your body reacting against the sudden absence of sugar and carbohydrates in the diet. It made the diet sound like an almost too easy way to lose weight and mentioned no ill-side effects. I am only about 15 pounds overweight and have no health problems. I wanted to use this diet to lose about 15 pounds, but am now concerned about the side effects that the book says nothing about."
2,This diet makes you crave sweets!,The longer I did this diet the more I craved sweets. I missed sugar so badly I experienced worse temptation than when I was not doing the diet. Not a good diet for people who enjoy some sugar in their lives.
5,simplicity meets results,"After reading the book and following the advice, the first thing I noticed was that just about everything I was ingesting was loaded with sugar...even things that you would not expect to have sugar at all. The next thing I realized was how dependant on sugar I was ...for the first few days I found myself actually getting out of bed to get something sweet. The last thing I noticed was the results...I have lost 15 pounds in the last 2 months and am currently losing a pound or so a week...all of this with my same work-out routine and following this simple diet"". No gimmicks...no BS. The author lays out a simple argument which explains the connection between sugar and weight gain and then explains what you have to avoid. It's the only ""diet"" that I've ever been able to stick with and the results speak for themselves. This is a winner!"
5,Lost 84lbs - Love this Book!,"This book is fantastic! I started following this program in 2005 and I lost 84lbs without exercise. Due to health reason's I couldn't exercise. I have kept off the weight because it isn't a diet you are modifying you eating behavior and it's easy once you start. Just stay focused and take it day-by-day. I used to eat sugar like crazy and after I started this book my body stopped craving it. I eat it every now and then, but I use Splenda instead since it's made from sugar. Just remember, we are worth it to feel good! Good Luck!"
5,This system is AMAZING,"I have fought fat all my life, and am NOT big on exercise. Weighed 300 lbs. on graduation from High School. I started this eating system (it ain't no diet) 2/99. It's now 8/99 and I've lost 40 lbs. Nothing ever worked like Sugar Busters for me, and the books explaination of WHY it works makes very clear sense. Buy it."
3,Realize everyone's body is different,"I haven't completed this book yet, but what I have found more interesting that the book itself is everyone's comments. These comments travel the full love-hate spectrum. One thing, and it is one of the MOST important things to remember -- everyone's body is different and each body will react differently to this program. For some it is an ideal metabolic fit, while for others it is a disaster. The program is working for me, so far, and I do not feel cheated, tired, or out of sorts, unfortunately, I do not feel an increased zest yet either. I do belive it is a book worth reading and evaluating for yourself."
4,It stands the nutrition world on its head!,"This book was clearly written in a simple, 6th grade level, for a specific reason. It was to appeal to more than just the scientific crowd. However, its basic premise appears revolutionary. That is, it is foods like corn and potatoes, not eggs and red meat that are the culprit in the high cholesterol war and in the weight loss battle. If this premise is true (and I'd like to see some scientific review) then the authors have done a great service to all. I have only recently read the book (3 days ago) but I will watch with great interest."
4,VERY INTERESTING,"I enjoyed the book, my only comment is that this being my second attempt at dieting (weight wathchers was my first attempt) I kinda like being given some type of guilelines for the amounts of the food that I can eat and also additional food substitutions would be good too. I just started yesterday and I am real excited !!!!"
3,Book won't satisfy a curious reader; little supporting data,"I got the impression that the book was written in a hurried, careless manner, as if its only purpose was to sell copies. There was no data from actual patients to back up the claims made. Surprisingly, no mention was made of the Adkins diet, which preceded Sugar Busters and is universally known. I haven't tried any diet yet, and I am not saying that this one, Adkins or any other diet will or will not work satisfactorily. I'm simply stating that for an educated person, with serious questions about the author's claims, few answers are given. It needn't have been so."
3,Americans consume too much sugar.,"This city has gone crazy for Sugar Busters. I think everyone in the city has at least tried the diet. You can now buy Sugar Buster breads at the store and eat sugar less entrees at Emeril's restaurant.My friend went on the plan and had some withdrawal nightmares but she got over it. She lost some weight but finds it difficult to stay on the diet all the time. I prefer to use ""The Zone"" by Barry Sears. I think balance, moderation and exercise is the key to good health. Try to avoid refined sugar and white flour as much as possible."
3,Nothing New,"Barry Sears covers this subject with more clarity and with better research data in ""The Zone"" and yet people continue to be surprised that carbohydrates cause weight gain when eaten in incorrect quantities. Sugar, as normally eaten in many forms (deserts and processed foods for example, is simply a poor way to get carbohydrates which must be limited to properly lose weight and stay in the zone. Read Sear's book. Then read ""Sugar Blues"" because it includes the dangers of eating processed sugar. What's the big deal?"
3,Not Bad So Far,"The book is an easy read. However, I am finding it difficult to find foods that do not contain sugar. The foods that they list in the book, especially the Sugar Buster! foods, are difficult to find. The shoppers guide is much more concise and, for me, it is more helpful than the book. I just started the diet, so we will see what happens."
1,"Cut sugar to trim life, is more like it...","Obviously, this author has no idea about what sound nutrition is. While simple sugars may be harmful to diabetics, for instance, complex carbohydrates, such as those found in starches, are VITAL. Carbohydrates are nutrients for a reason: we need them to LIVE! Similarly, the prescription for carbohydrates in the average person's diet is 50% of total caloric intake. This is all sound medical fact! Not the hogwash this author tries to sell to you! Seriously, any college biology student can tell you the dangers of this diet. Go find a a book advocating sound nutrition, such as Weil's Eating Well For Optimum Health : The Essential Guide to Food, Diet, and Nutrition. Don't be fooled by the false promises of fad diets...corpses lose weight pretty fast too."
5,An Easy Read For A Program That Works,"I just purchased my fifth copy of Sugar Busters. I needed to purchase copy five because I gave away my first four. When friends and family ask how I have managed to lose such a significant amount of weight, and then pressure me for specifics, I find it easier to simply give them the book. I am even more gratified, however, when friends tell me they became so excited about the program that they passed their copy onto another friend or family member. Once you get into the Sugar Buster's program, it is a piece of cake (or broccoli)."
5,It worked for me,"It's hard to argue with success. The authors premise is that excessive insulin levels in your blood is what causes your body to store fat and elevate cholesterol levels. Since I started on this diet 3 months ago my cholesterol went down 35 points. I've lost 11 pounds. And it has ""cured"" my diabetes. If I follow the diet, my blood sugar stays completely normal. It's also one of the most sensible eating plans I've ever come across. I still eat carbohydrates, but they are whole grain or whole wheat now. The only thing I've had to give up is sugar, which was easier than I thought it would be. Pretty amazing for a lifelong chocoholic. The fact that I can still eat cheese, peanutbutter and other tasty foods makes it fairly easy. If you want to lose weight, lower your cholesterol, or get your diabetes under control, give it a try. This book has done everything for my health the authors said it would."
3,The book vs. the diet,"Although I don't feel this book is particularly well written, and the diet plan is at times vague, the basic principles are sound. We've been on the diet for 1 month. By eliminating all sugar and restricting carbs, and carefully monitoring his blood, my husband hasn't needed his diabetes medication at all (he's type 2 but not insulin dependent) - a real triumph. We've both lost weight, without feeling deprived. Best of all, no weighing or measuring!"
5,EXCELLENT!,"This is a wonderful book that explains sound nutritional principles in a tasteful (no pun intended) and appealing way. For anyone who is tired of the ""1,000 calorie, 0 grams of fat, starve yourself to emaciation diet"", this is the book for you. As the authors explain, fat is a necessary element for a healthy diet and - just as I learned in basic biology class - sugar and carbohydrates quickly convert into fat.Also, the doctors explain why eating too many carbohydrates makes us feel drowsy and exhausted. I've always wondered why so-called ""professional coaches"" told athletes to carbo-load the day before a competition, and not the day of because eating too many carbohydrates makes a person tired. It always seemed strange to me to eat more carbohydrates if they just made you tired anyhow (and not to mention that they make you fat.)"
4,Excellent information-Book is probably better than the tape,"I purchased the Audio Cassette book. It was extremely informative, and it also came with some really neat recipie cards. I'm still going to go out and purchase the book though.There's a lot of information that you just can't remember from the tape. It would have been nice if they had listed the foods that are/are not allowed on the cards instead of the recipies."
5,High Quality,"Well made device.I bought the chest expander too. I think that the two combined make a great system.I now have two sets of handles and many cable options.But if I could only buy one of the two pruducts it would be this one.With some imagination, many good strengthening movements are possible with this."
5,Excellent quality and blazingly fast shipping,"The picture for this item does not really do it justice. This is a great set of stumps for a great price. I received this item within two days after ordering (Hawk ships immediately, apparently) but that may be because it was shipped from Princeton, NJ, and I live up in the northeast corner of the state. Anyway, this set of stumps is definitely worth your money. I highly recommend them and may be making future purchases from Hawk."
4,Tender Story,This story gives insight into early interactions and cultural differences between Americans and Japanese. A quick read. Can be hard to find.
2,Good but superficial,This DVD is a good but superficial review of the Battle of Stalingrad. The film of the weather conditions and the fighting is gripping but I have seen it elsewhere. If you are interested in this battle or anything related to WWII my advice is that you not buy this DVD. Instead pool your giftcards and buy the masterpiece World At War collection.
3,Battle for Stalingrad,The DVD was informative. Yet it did not provide the type of information I required. A better DVD is the World at War series.
1,great for children,"I am extremely disappointed, perhaps this is the reason that retail book stores are still in business. Had I had the chance to thumb through the book, I would have never purchased it. It is a condescending primitive level intro to the web and commerce on the web. It is not for marketing professionals nor professionals of any kind. Probably high school kids would be offended as well. The audience is people who have never even surfed! I think that this would be a good intro for the computer-illiterate who is looking for basic information. The real problem is that it was not advertised nor reviewed in that light."
4,"A great,up-to-date primer for users and web newcomers.","Although extremely comprehensive, this book is not for the marketing professional. It is an excellent summary of all the web has to offer, and highlights a number of not-so-well-known url's that are a great resource for individuals setting up a small e-commerce website."
3,Not the exact book,"Although the book had the same ISBN, it was a review copy, and was somewhat different than everyone else. Although, it was at a great price, I wish I'd known it was a ""Instructors Review Copy,"" I may not have purchased it. My teacher was very skeptical about letting me use it in class. She thought it had all the answers. The condition was new, no markings, tears or missing pages."
4,A Chilling Collection of Stories,"Being Dead by Vivian Vande Velde is a book that left me quite unsure of what to expect when I picked it up the other day. It had a couple of interesting reviews on the front and back stating how scary the stories were and claiming that they would keep you restless for several nights at a time. After reading the first story, Drop by Drop, I was blown away at how amazingly unexpected the ending was and how likeable Brenda (the main character) was. The story itself is about a girl (Brenda) moving into an old house in Upstate, New York and discovering that the little girl who haunts her isn't all she's cracked up to be. The other stories in the book were amazing, too, but I felt that none of them really were comparable to Drop by Drop.I reccomend this book to readers of all ages, preferably those who, like me, were in dire need of a spooky tale to tell their friends at an upcoming sleepover. Enjoy!"
2,One of the worst crafts books I've seen,"The majority of the crafts are not practical for classroom use, because of the materials they require (felt, for example, doesn't happen to be something my school provides), and the cultural information preceding the activities is so little that any classroom time spent engaged in such activities would require additional research to be done by the teacher, or else would be merely an art lesson.Also, the pictures are not even in color--entirely in black and blue.I do not recommend this book."
3,"Great Nest Box, No Hardware, Missing Minor Piece",The nest box looks well put together nest box for my cockatiels. It is lacking the perch shown in the photo (just a hole) and absolutely no hardware to mount to the cage.I'm sure I can get a dowel rod to make another perch and will have to look into hardware for mounting. Good nest box design though and the opening sides for cleaning is very good. No hardwareand missing perch knocks it down two stars.
2,BROKE,I got this because I had a cast on my leg after surgery... 6 weeks is a long time to deal with trash bags. So this looked great. It DID work great for the first couple of uses.... and then it BROKE. The rubber ring ripped in half. So needless to say I was not impressed by the durability of the product. I would expect to get more than a few uses out of it before it broke.I will say however I found use for the plastic bag (after it broke) as a rain protector for the cast.
1,Not Worth It,"Duro-Med Adult Short Leg (23) Protector, ClearI used this cast protector twice and the second time the rubber seal split when pulling it over my cast. So much water leaked into my cast that I needed to have it changed. I have been using the Curad brand cast protector multiple times since then and it stretches over your cast without tearing and is completely leak proof."
1,Didn't fit,Adult size did not fit over cast of 14-year-old boy. Length was perfect but blue ring was not wide enough to fit over basic below-the-knee cast.
1,Leaky,Save your money. Water gets through the top way to easily. Going back to the trash bag that never leaked.
1,Very flimsy,this product worked good for three showers then the gasket on the top tore out while pulling it off and I was back to using masking tape and a garbage sack. There should be replaceable gaskets for this and then it would be a good idea.
2,Not a good product,This product seemd like a good idea but it is not very durable. The plastic came apart after three uses. I do not recommend this.
1,Tears easily,"I ordered this product and as soon as I put it on, the plastic around it tore. It's so flimsy.What a waste of $$."
1,Don't buy the 'long' unless you won a guinness book world record for tallness,"The handle tie trash bags worked fine. I ordered this in my Vicodin-induced haze. When I got it, it was way too long. I guess I ordered the long version, but there's no way I could tell what the difference since they didn't describe short vs. long. I figured short was midget-sized or something. So don't order the long version unless you're abnormally tall, like 8 feet because I'm 5'7"" and it's freakishly long. I can still use it, but I didn't have a problem with handle-tie garbage bags either when I was showering. I definitely wouldn't use this or a garbage bag to soak in the tub though. Both would leak."
1,Failed 2nd time I used it,"I was very excited to get this after having to get a cast. I followed all the instructions and was very gentle with this item. While putting it on the 3rd time, the rubber cuff tore making it totally unusable. I'm very displeased with the quality."
5,Great,This is a pretty good piece of equipment. I reccomend it to anyone who needs one. It sure makes showering and bathing a heck of alot easier!
1,Broke quickly,"I recently had foot surgery and ordered the short leg protector. The diaphragm is very tight and was difficult to slip over my cast. After two uses, the rubber diaphragm tore completely apart. Very disappointed in this product. I have used other brands in the past for previous surgeries with no problems."
1,This product is pure garbage,It broke after just two uses. Not bad. $9 per use. Using a trash bag & rubber bands instead approached $0 and we still have the trash bag & rubber bands.
2,Broke within the first week,I bought this product to cover my leg cast and for the first few days it worked perfectly but only after a few uses the rubber at the top broke and it's purpose was lost. I will advise not to waste $15 on this product unless it's for a one time use.
1,Major Disappointment- Save your money,"This item is difficult to use. The opening is so small that it would be difficult to insert a healthy leg, let alone an injured leg which is what I bought it for. The picture shows a cast on the models leg. I have a surgical scar with no cast and couldn't insert my leg. I resorted to taping trash bags on my leg to shower and they worked wonderfully. Save your money and don't buy this product. I'm currently homebound so I can't get to the post office anytime soon to return the product."
3,Worked okay but....,"Broke my leg and ankle and was anxious to be able to shower. Ordered this and indeed I was able to slide it over the cast with some effort, and happily was able to take a shower and keep the cast dry.Unfortunately the gasket/seal tore as I was taking it off, so I only got one use out of it. Sort of expensive for one shower!Going forward, I used a trashbag and water-proof medical tape, and that did the trick... Perhaps I had bad luck, but this product was too expensive to only use once."
5,No more one legged baths!,"Works perfectly, easy to put on and take off, being in a cast for 7+ weeks this was something I really needed."
4,Great protector,"This is a great product ! I had foot surgery 2 weeks ago and had purchased this prior to surgery .It works great , good quality plastic and rubber band on top. The only negative is the unusually tight top ,but that's a good thing.The band keeps everything water tight . You can only use this with an extra set of hands."
2,Opening Too Small,"The concept is good, however, the size of the aperture in the diaphragm (not the ring) is too small. It may work OK for a child but I think it is too tight for most adults. We went back to a plastic kitchen trash bag and a couple of rubber bands."
1,Not worth the $$,Only able to use it one time...gasket ripped when removing the cover after the first shower. Back to using a trash bag!
2,Terrible construction,"I wanted this for my wife so she could have a small light on her key chain.This light, when you can get it to work is bright enough. However, this is not a simple 'button' press light. There is a small switch that you must slid, in most cases with your finger nail, up and down to engage the light. In the pictures and even in the description it says, ""Constant or Momentary ON/OFF switch."" This is deceiving as well as the picture. Also, the plastic is separating around the bulb. Reviews here of 'solid' construction are inaccurate. The only thing that works is the carabiner clip which is really hard to mess up.I returned one as I thought it was just a flawed item I had received - the replacement was exactly the same so buyer beware - can't believe Smith $ Wesson put their name on this!"
3,Light is ok,"I bought this light to attach to a set of house keys for walking the dog at night. I wanted something that would let me see the door when we got back, as well as light the path a little while walking. I was dissappointed that the light is really hard to get to stay on, and even hard just to turn on. But it works ok as just a light attached to a set of keys - it is fine as a light that you want on for 10 seconds, but not for something to actually use multiple times per walk."
4,I like it,"I have been searching for a little light that I can attach to my dogs leash for when we go walking in the dark. This works great. It clips right on and I have no worries about losing it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the little on/off switch is a little difficult to operate but I am thrilled that it has a constant on, when stopping to pick up dog poo, you need a constant on and a lot of the small flashlights do NOT offer a constant on, so while I might struggle to get this little light turned back off when I am done, I am still thankful that I have the option to turn it on and off! All and All a very handy little light and the clip is durable and will not accidentally slip off the leash, like so many others I have tried!"
5,This is awesome,"It is small and rugged, the led light bulb is not going to break easily and the button won't turn on in your pocket.I got this to replace one I had gotten at a gas station and it is exactly what I was looking for."
4,Useful reference book for the snorkeller/diver in Bermuda.,"I have been using this book as a pre-snorkel class teaching tool for 15 years - in its waterproof plastic version. (I am not sure that paperback version will last that long!). It has 98% of the fish snorkellers in Bermuda will see, with clear illustrations and brief but informative descriptive paragraphs on the opposite page. Fish colour is sometimes a tad off, but not enough to matter. It's only drawback is lack of inclusion of lobster, anemones, sea cucumbers, and that sort of thing."
4,"Great PDA, even better phone","I bought one of this phones with an offer from TigerDirect, and activated it with a plan from my Verizon Wireless retalier, it is great, i live in Dominican Republic, its is simply the best purchase i could have ever made, it really solves the problem of having to go around with a cell phone and a pda, now i can have it all together, listen to my mp3's, download my email, and talk on the phone at the same time... it really is amazing"
1,Shamefully limited DVD of a superlative series,"The one star refers to the DVD version only. The original Winds of War miniseries is superlative, the best miniseries I have ever seen on television.But this DVD is woefully, shamelessly and utterly disappointingly limited. NO extras. NO sound enhancement from the original, cramped TV monaural audio to enhanced stereo or surround sound. The DVD video quality is somewhat better than VHS. But absent better sound, the DVD's are not worth the price if one already has the VHS version.I'm glad I rented the first disk from Netflix in order to sample it before buying the set. I cannot overstate my dismay over the lack of sound improvement. The original musical soundtrack was superb in its own right, and battle scenes and other sonics also cried out to be stereo-ized and surround-ized. But the producers of this DVD evidently decided to go the cheapie route. Again, what a disappointment!"
4,great entertainment,The story is epic. The production quality is amazing particularly for a made for TV mini series. Great historic content-Pug Henry was in on every development in the European theatre leading up to war. The romance is a little too thick. all in all--entertaining
4,Swept Away,"The story begins in the years before WW2 and a familys' journey into those turbulent times. The casting, while quite good at times, was not flawless. Mitchum, as stalwart Pug Henry, was his commanding and intuitive best. Jan-Michael Vincent was annoying, but that was perhaps his characters' persona. Ali MacGraw was playing her Love Story character - if Jennifer had been alive in those days - smart mouthed, know it all and completely aware of the camera. Those things aside, the stories are the thing, as they say. The politics of war, how one familycopes with the changes in the world and their world, all coming together. You can become thoroughly engrossed and caring about these people and their struggles. You get a real feel for the era and what led to WW2. Granted, the Henrys' are fictional, butthe interwoven facts make this an exceptional drama."
5,Monumental series,"The series steps the viewer through the major events leading up to the war in Europe and then up through the attack on Pearl Harbor through the viewpoint of fictional eyewitnesses. It puts us on the ground in a Polish village on the morning of the German invasion, with insight into the hopelessness of Polish cavalry against Stuka divebombers."
3,"the war scenes are decent, but the soap opera scenes are sickening","I enjoyed the military scenes (both Allied and Axis were well done). The war/military acting and effects were realistic and believable; and they make the miniseries worth watching.Unfortunately, between 33% to 50% of each episode is soap opera stuff. I tolerated it for the first couple of DVDS. For the rest of the DVDs, when I recognized a soap opera scene was about to start, I fast-forwarded through it. Ali MacGraw's acting was over-the-top and annoying.I recommend this series as a rental, but I wouldn't buy it (and I don't plan on seeing it again...once was enough).To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on ""Listmania! Lists""."
5,Happily found old favorite,I lost my copy of The Winds of War in a flood. I was so happy to find this set and in suchpristine condition.
5,A great start to the War and Remeberance Saga,A truly great start to the War and Rememberance Saga. If you want history and a great story line this is the one to see. An all star cast. Great movie.
2,A Great Story--but an Absolutely Terrible Transfer to DVD!,"While the story is magnificent, this is the absolute worst conversion from film to DVD that I've ever seen! There are big clumps of dirt visible throughout the movie, presumably from a dirty transfer mechanism. Parts of this movie are so grainy that you would think the film was originally done on 8mm! Paramount should be ashamed for releasing this putrid transfer and ruining a fine saga."
3,Ali McGraw is responsible for WW II,"The Winds of War is a well done, workmanlike mini-series that offers the viewer hours of entertaiment along with a history lesson on the characters and events conspring in the lead up to WW II. Robert Mitchum is superbly cast as the Naval Attache in Berlin on the eve of war. Ralph Ballamy's Roosevelt is utterly believable, as our most of the other performances.The weak link is Ali McGraw, who gives a breathtakingly idiotic performance, never breaking out of her ""I'm reading aloud from the phone book"" monotone -- even during the bombing of Warsaw! She sucks the life out of every scene that she's in. As a performer, she is blissfully uninvolved with her character. That said, if you can get past her sleep walking, it's -- other than that --a fine film."
5,Christmas Gift given,"Item arrived on time and in condition as promised. However, the receiver informed me it was missing some segments he remembered from the series."
5,Excellent material. Every American should view the entire series.,"EXCELLENT. Casting, dialog is right on the money. A must see film series for all Americans. Money well spent."
4,Great except video quality,"Everyone in the family loves this mini-series. So why did I give it 4 stars out of 5? Poor video quality, plain and simple. Of course, I still highly recommend this set, but believe it helps if you know what you're getting up front; i.e., nothing here has been remastered. If fact, anything in the white(ish) spectrum has a halo effect and is overly bright. We watched it with the contrast & brightness lowered to reduce eye strain, and that did help somewhat.Beyond that, I agree with everything that has been said about the series itself. It is simply outstanding! So I expect we'll be watching it at least once a year, every year, and will continue to hope for a remastered edition? How about it, Paramount?"
2,Winds of War re dux,"It is difficult to comment on the W of W episodes without considering the other, War & remembrance..I had read the books and then watched this on TV when it first was shown,and eagerly awaited the release on DVD. The second time around,however,now that I am older and wiser, I found myself concentrating on how Mr Mitchum was much too old for the part. Mostly I just wanted to punch the arrogant old man Jastrow in the nose for being so incredibly stupid. The casting in the W of W episode was far superior to that in the W & R episodes. The georgeous uniforms of the German Generals and the talent of Jeremy Kemp were iminently enjoyable. Bergen was delightfully hatable.The history was sort of accurate (the dumbed down young folks of today won't know the difference) but the series is unfortunately quite outdated."
3,Overall OK,"I ordered this set for my husband's birthday because he loves war movies. He had seen it when it came out on TV. I don't remember ever watching it. I wasn't sure what to expect. I think the acting of Jan-Michael Vincent and Ali MacGraw are cheesy to say the least. Especially MacGraw. Robert Mitchum does a good job. The show on a whole is ok. It is long. So expect several nights of watching. I also bought War and Remembrance. I'm glad Ali MacGraw will not be in that one, I don't think I could have taken much more of her acting ""or lack of""."
4,Outstanding except film quality,"""Winds of War"" is THE best WW-II series ever produced for TV. The acting, directing, and editing are outstanding. The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that the print used for this dvd is a ""grainy film"" print. To spend this much time and effort on a series and then have the film processors make a grainy print is beyond belief. Nevertheless, it is excellent and well-worth adding to one's collection."
4,Good series; Ali MacGraw pitfiful,"I really liked the series, but the cast from War and Remembrance was so much better. Ali Macgraw was so annoying as Natalie Henry. Most of all, Ali Macgrew as about 10 years too old to be playing the 30ish Natalie Jastrow. Who else agrees? And Jan Michael Vincent was 10 years too old to be playing 22 year old Byron Henry."
3,Should have re-mastered,"Love the miniseries as I did in the 80s. However, I bought the DVD expecting a sharp clear print, unlike the VHS tape I made when I watched it in the 80s.Unfortunately, looks like they merely burned an old VHS print off to DVD. Very fuzzy, gauzy, and backlit. Clearly NOT remastered.My old homemade VHS looks as good. Oh well, at least the DVD set has subtitles to ensure aural comprehension."
4,Ambitious and largely successful,"Dramatically this was an ambitious project. It is a kind of survey of World War II along with a two generation family saga with multiple subplots derived from the interplay between world conditions and each character's human hopes and problems.The war issues require and get accuracy and some detail. The war story is well done. The two generation human story requires character development and, for the most part, this is delivered to the viewer.The story contains some rather good insights into what really happened early on in the onset of World War II.The subplots are set against realistic backgrounds and they are uniformly suspenseful. This story holds your interest and proves very entertaining.If you haven't seen it by all means try it."
4,WoW VHS Series,"Mom and I watch a lot of movies together. Mom is 71 and I am 46. She asked me to see if I could find the Winds of War and we were both ASTONISHED to not only find the series, but to find it at such an AMAZING PRICE. The 7 tape boxed set was in excellent condition. Most of todays war movies have a lot faster action, and a lot less romance. The Winds of War series has a lot of WW2 historical events shown in it. We were both very impressed by the actor who played Adolf Hitler. It was hard to wait for the next movie."
4,"Good, but could have been much better quality","I give the miniseries itself a full 5 stars (well-deserved), but I cannot give this dvd set a good rating, and here's why:1. silent, unimaginative menus, and original full frame.2. Dual mono (like it matters!)3. Awful transfer, sometimes very grainy. Mostly average.4. ""Extras"" are actually just one interview broken up into 4, about an hour or so in total. 17 minutes here, 13 there... you get the idea.5. Bare bones set. Forget easter eggs, 5.1 audio. Disappointing.In summary, how can you NOT buy this set? We've been waiting for it for over 20 years! But they really didn't give it much effort. They certainly should have, since this is THE best miniseries ever. Paid the 50+ bucks. Guess we are lucky to get this on dvd in any condition we can (that must be how the distributor is thinking...)"
3,It was just ok,"If you read the book then you will be disappointed with the DVD set. If not, you will probably think the made for TV movie is just ok. It was made back in the 80's so it has that Simon & Simon/A-Team feel to it. There was some glaring miscasting (i.e., Victor Henry, Rhoda Henry, Palmer Kirby, Natalie Jastrow), in my opinion. However, on the upside it does move a 900 page novel along rather nicely. There is some decent imagery in places that keep things from getting dull. I gave it three stars because I was fairly neutral about the whole experience."
3,my impression,"I read the novel ""the winds of the war"" some years ago. Recently I borrowed its video from a friend. I could hardly wait to enjoy it. I like the Henry men. But as I watched the tape, I felt somewhat disappointed. Victor Henry, I am sorry to say, is too old. and Natalie is not what I had imagined. She looks too soft, not tough enough. However the story is really touching. I feel great pity for Rhoda, who could not cherish her husband's love. I admire Natalie's courage to face all those terrible happenings. And I would like to enjoy it again if I have another chance."
4,"Fast delivery, good price, no surprises","This product was delivered within 4 days (better than what I expected; I had expected a week or more). The price was a bargain, much less than I had seen in the stores, and it was just what I had been shopping for. Content was complete (no surprises), but it was not HD quality (but I hadn't expected HD quality). The original series was released in 1983, and 1983-quality picture and sound are what you get--better than VHS, but not of 480p DVD quality. Closed caption has been added, and I enjoyed the added feature, ""The Making of . . ."" a sort of ""then and now"" interviews with still-living cast and crew. Interesting. In summery, I enjoyed it and made a good decision based on what I expected and what I got. An HD audio/video fanatic might think otherwise."
5,The Winds of War,A must see. Can be seen each year. Excellent source of history and a tribute to The Greatest Generation.
5,Great book plot adapted to video,"I had read ""The Winds of War"" before I saw the miniseries. It is not usual for a movie script to convey what makes a book great but this not the case with ""The Winds of War"". Robert Mitchum plays a great role as a naval officer who sees himself, due to incredible multi-language capability, serving in naval intelligence in Europe and visiting the hot spots of that continent during the late 1930`s; like Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Soviet Union, United Kingdom ect. His younger son`s role plays out like the young are and how blinded they can be by love. His wife and her uncle roles are well played and show us those people who still think that a river will not be flooded even though they can hear the water rushing down its course. All the roles are well played. A good miniseries."
2,williams sonoma collection: american,"I ordered this book used and the description said it was in very good condition. I received the book without the jacket and the top part of the spine was broken. Aside from that its good, but without the jacket it doesn't match he rest of the Williams sonoma books in my collection"
5,A wonderful video for children,"Pippi is a positive, energetic character. The villians are laughable, rather than scary. The plot is about adventures children love, not the usual adult plots put into children's characters. So, if you are tired of children's movies where the story is based on romantic love, or on the mommy or daddy figure being killed, then you would love this DVD. My kids do, and I do too!"
5,RE: RE: re: re: alt.d&d,"in response to doppleganger371 and darkwiz001 and their comparison of a elf with 20 hit points and the wizard with 50 hit points: AS IF!!!!!!!!NO f-ING WAY, buddy. Like THAT will ever happen!!! And I might roll a 13!! Yeah, go smoke your marijuana cigarettes and speak your voodoo mojo somewhere else...CAUSE THE HAND AIN'T LISTENING!!if you want to correspond more my handle is DDWiz"
1,a disappointment,"I purchased this book with hopes of providing our students a lighthearted alternative in our college resource room, only to find it to be a silly, often offensive and weak attempt at parody. Too bad.The only fitting description is found within the title: ""utterly useless."" To the recycling bin it goes."
1,This book is lame-o!,"Believe me: I had to read this book for a review I wrote for a little newspaper called THE HARVARD CRIMSON. So I read the Harvard Lamepoon's latest attempt at being 'funny' in a 'hilarious' way that 'makes' people 'laugh' 'hard,' and let me just tell you, Amazon reader/shoppers, it in no way was as funny as any other thing that they ever wrote, which also was not funny at all. if you want funny, read the tongue-in-cheek piece I wrote in the HARVARD CRIMSON on the Harvard Tequilla Club. Get your drink on boy!!please send me an email if you want to talk more. My name is Vicky Hallet and I attend Harvard University. I live off campus."
2,Don't Buy These Binoculars...,"...unless you want to have trouble focusing, have difficulty using them indoors at a sporting event, or have the neck strap bracket break off, etc. I wear glasses and these never did focus well for me. I was not happy when the bracket broke off the day I received them, just as I was to leave for an Africa safari vacation. The biocs kept slipping off my neck the whole trip, and it was frustrating.Even more frustrating was trying to get them repaired. Suposedly there is a warranty on these. Hah! When I sent them to Bushnell for repair, they wanted [...]."
2,Disapointed,"I bought these binoculars because I wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding. First time out, I had difficulty getting a clear focus. To make maters worse, every bird that I looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it's head. I have a pair of Nikon 10X25s which out performed the Bushnell's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness. I am returning the Bushnell's and considering the Audubon Equinox HP binoculars instead."
1,Arrived Broken,"The binoculars arrived broken -they were cracked near the point where they pivot. Not sure if this was a product defect, due to very rough shipping/handling, or someone else had purchased the product and returned it broken which the store did not catch before they sold to us. In any case, the fact the binoculars were broken speaks clearly as to the poor manufacturing/quality control.In the future, I will cross Bushnell off my list of acceptable brands."
2,Good for the price but some essential parts not replaceable,"This is a good binocular for the price, but I found out that with the low price comes at least one essential weakness. Somehow the post that slips into the binocular body and attaches to the shoulder harness broke. Well, I thought, thank God for the Bushnell Lifetime Warranty... Only thing is, that item is not covered if Bushnell decides you handled the thing too roughly and, not only will they not fix it for you, but they don't have a replacement! So I am relegated to forever using my Bushnell Excursions without a shoulder-harness or any kind of carrying strap!"
1,Didn't fit BB8700,"This case doesn't fit the Blackberry 8700, it never close well. Also it doesn't have protection for the screen."
2,This DVD Contains NO Lost Episodes as the Title Suggests,"Hi Folks! I am a big fan of Lucille Ball, so when I saw this listing for ""Lost Episodes"" of the Lucy Show (and on DVD too), I was quick to order. As a fan of Lucille Ball, I was looking forward to receiving this new release of ""Lost Episodes"" on DVD. Unfortunately, what I received was a DVD with 5 regular season episodes from the ""Lucy Show"". These are not lost by any means, in fact I own the VHS versions of them all already.If you don't already own these previously released favorites on VHS, or have not seen them on repeat after repeat on TV, then you will certainly enjoy this collection which contains the following 5 ""NOT lost"" episodes: Lucy Gets A Roommate (Episode 114 with Carol Burnett), Lucy & Carol in Palm Springs (#115), Lucy Meets John Wayne (#119), Lucy w/ George Burns (#111) and Lucy Meets The Berles (#137). All of these are very funny episodes, but alas I say again - not lost!"
