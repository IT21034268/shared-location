1,Limited functionality,"The only pins wired are the red, Green, Blue video and the Verticle and Horizontal Syncs. Ground return for all signals is provided through the connector shell. While the video quality is good, any Plug and Play functions or PC based power functions (standyby, etc) are non-operational. This leaves many monitors fully powered up even when the PC is in Standby or turned off!"
1,What a piece of junk!,"Purchase this cable to replace two cables I had cobbled together, to make them long enough. The idea was to replace them with one continuous cable and get better visual quality. Boy was I surprised when I turn my computer back on and the words were fussy. Thought I was seeing things - but when I returned to my two cable affair - it worked fine again! Not sure if this cable was defective or just poor quality? My guess was poor quality and it smelled funny like old rubber tires? Buy the better cable"
2,Blurry image / shadow effect,"I basically used this cable for a simple monitor hook up, because the standard 6 ft cable would not be long enough for the office setup I had. The image it produced was noticeably blurry, with a slight shadow effect. I thought I might be able to just ignore, but it was too frustrating. I returned it for a refund and ended up purchasing this cable on Amazon: ""Cables To Go - 29607 - 12ft Ultima HD15 M/M SXGA Monitor Cable"", which works beautifully. I highly recommend going for the better quality cable here."
1,Poor quality,"Tried using this on 2 machines (1 mac, 1 pc) with 2 different monitors each.This cable caused ghosting no matter what machine or monitor was used.It was a good deal for a cable, but I got what I paid for. Not even worth paying to ship it back because the price was so good!"
2,You get what you pay for!,"I bought this to cennect my laptop to my 26"" LCD TV. It works, but doesnt give the correct resolution. It cannot handle resolutions above 1024 x 768. This means it is just a square and doesnt look good on a wide screen TV. So i borrowed my friend's cable and his worked beautifully. If your looking for a cheap way to hook up your laptop to your TV in low resolution, then this is for you."
1,Terrible Quality,Both cables I received are now in the trash. Right away one cable displayed a slightly flickering image. The second cable is now starting to flicker and distort the image. Other cables I used to replace them show a clear image. The problem is definitely with the cables. My order came from HDE (HottestDealEver Corp) and fulfilled by Amazon.
1,Didn't work,We purchased this to connect our PC to our TV and this item didn't work. We eventually got another- just like it- and it worked. This one must have been defective.
1,Cable stopped working w/in 10 days,"First they accidentally shipped me a different cable. Then after I made them aware of their mistake they sent me the correct cable, only to find that it lasted about 10 days before it stopped working. The wires seem extremely cheap. I understand that for the price I paid I should expect this, except [...] has cheaper cables and I've NEVER had an issue with them.Will not buy from again."
2,Not durable,"I bought this VGA cable to connect my laptop to display on my TV. It works pretty well as expected at beginning. But after about 3 months, it adds other colors to the display from time to time. I have to twist the cable to show the right color and it's not stable either."
2,This male-to-male VGA cable made my screen look fuzzy!,"Pros:The cable was nice and long.Cons:My screen looks definitely fuzzier with the new cable, than with my old cable. I don't know if this is because it lacks shielding or what."
4,Works great,"Works great, good price! I watch streaming content from my laptop now my big screen in no time at all."
1,Never buy the cheapest cable.,Cable did not work on my laptop to HDTV. Checked continuity between pins and only 10 of the 15 pins were connected. Not worth the return postage.
1,Doesn't Work,"It would be a good deal if it actually worked. It only works if you bend it at a very specific angle, and that's obviously very inconvenient."
4,Worked exactly as I'd hope,"It came to me exactly as described, in perhaps 5 days, I can't recall the exact passage of time. Its longer than my imagination made it out to be, but it worked fine. I use it to connect an old 2007 laptop and a new 42 inch LCD display my roommate recently acquired. With the addition of a spare stereo 1/8 inch male to male cable, she can watch all the Netflix she wants.The quality of material is average, certainly not the beefiest cable I've seen, but who cares. It works, its cheap as balls. So be it. Works on all VGA standards with no degradation as far as I've tested."
3,satisfied,"cable works, almost new, right length excellent price and shipment arrived on time, in a nutshell i am satisfied with the product."
1,Very bad cable,This cable is horrible. Windows doesnt recognize the plug and play capability of my 27 inch monitor and I cant even get the correct screen resolution 1080p. I know its not a software issue because the DVI cable I bought works just fine. Overall was a big hassle. You get what you paid for.
1,Does not work with my monitor,"This cable does not work with my ASUS VH226 monitor. When I connected using this cable Windows 7 did not recognized my monitor except as a Non-Pnp Display, which is its way of saying ""there is something plugged into your VGA port but I don't think it works right"". Because of that the maximum resolution available was 1600x1200 and no matter what resolution I picked the image was blurry. The monitor still works perfectly fine with my old VGA cable outputting picture-perfect 1080p (1920x1080). Unfortunately my old cable was too short for what I needed, hence I tried buying this. A waste of $4, oh well."
2,meh....,for the price sure its a good buy but if your looking for good picture quality then this isn't for you. lucky i found my original vga cable and just decided to use this one for a back up
2,"Works, but only after I made it work","I bought it because it's cheap, but I got what I paid for. A cheap cord. Some of the pins were bent, as was one of the outside plates, and I had to force it to finally work. I'd go for something a bit better, but the quality is pretty good."
1,Garbage!,Did not work on laptop to Samsung TV. Worked on desk top computer but quality very bad. Can't wait to replace it with a quality cable. Should have known with that low price. Not worth the money to return.
5,Worked for what we needed it for,"This was great because I get to hook up the signal from my laptop and stay on the other side of the room, it is only a video cable though so no sound went into my big screen, which is okay. It worked for what we needed it for."
1,Really bad,"I bought this VGA cable to connect my new LED monitor to my laptop, to my surprise it did not work, not only that , it caused overheat and electric shock to my laptop. Luckily , my laptop got disconnected in time by itself. It is really bad !!"
5,"Great product, good price","Great product for a good price - does exactly as advertised - screen from laptop looks great on out 26"" HDTV."
1,"BEWARE, Not all pins are connected thru this cable","This cable is not only cheaply made with thumb screws that are very difficult to turn, but although all 15 pins are present on each end, many are not connected through the cable. In my application, the signal is missing that allows the ""Plug and Play"" feature on the mother board to identify the monitor type and resolution options. Therefore I cannot set the screen size correctly on an HDTV (1920x1080) monitor.The ""Technical Details"" section on the Amazon page does not tell you which pins are active or inactive. Also, the pins are not gold plated and there is a ferrite bead on only one end of the cable, not two as stated and pictured.In this case, ""buying cheap"" was not a good decision on my part."
3,Cheap cable,"This cable is a great buy for the price, except after moving it around to a few too many monitors. I bought this cable 6 months ago, it has worked flawlessly until I started moving the cable around to different workstations. The connector and the cable itself are not held in place together tightly, this means that you can swivel the end connector about 180 degrees before it kinks and you cannot turn it anymore (pulling on the wires inside.) I must have twisted mine a bit too much and at times it displays red and blue where white should be displayed on the monitor. I know it is not the monitor...this is a cheap cable. I recommend gluing or taping the end connectors so that you cannot twist them and break connections."
2,yuck,Everything looks blurry and my tv sometimes looses sync because the signal appears weak. Maybe this would be better for a desktop video card than for a laptop's VGA output?
3,"It does the job, BUT...","There's a slight blur to it when connecting it to my TV. I can deal with it, but it's not optimal and it does what's it's supposed to. It could have been somewhat clearer, though. If you can deal with a slight blur then go ahead, but don't expect crystal clear quality even at the right resolutions. My original crystal clear cable displays it just fine."
3,Does not work for 1080p,"Using a 46"" Sony 1080p tv, the cable could not drive the tv at 1080p, works fine for our other computer at 1280x1024 though. No ghosting and seems durably constructed"
3,Doesn't play well with HD,"This cable is VERY long, so it's very versatile in that regard. However, the picture quality is rather abysmal. On my Toshiba Satellite laptop hooked up to my 40"" Westinghouse LED TV, it only allows 4:3 resolutions. I have a shorter, older VGA cable that allows full HD between the laptop and the TV. On top of that, there are ghost lines throughout the picture. Connecting between my desktop computer and my 27"" Samsung LED monitor, it does allow 1920x1080 resolution, but there are ghost lines everywhere in the picture. Not the least bit tolerable. Again, the other VGA cable I have gives a crisp and sharp picture. I have half a mind to return this cable, but it was only 5 bucks, not enough to raise a fuss about. This cable will be staying in the closet unless I need it in a pinch.Short version: ghost lines in the picture, doesn't allow 16:9 HD resolutions on TVs. I do not recommend it."
3,An okay cable...,"This cable is 10 ft... It is VGA. But I get slight noise with it and it doesn't pull up my display's name as my other VGA cables do. But if you're just using it as a secondary display (as I am), it's fine."
5,Laptop to the Big Screen,"the 10ft hi resolution monitor cable arrived exactly as described and very quickly. i use it from my laptop docking station to my wall mounted 40"" lcd tv. using a bluetooth keyboard and mouse i can perform all tasks from across the room using the 40"" lcd tv as my monitor just like as if the laptop were across my legs. while using the microsoft explorer folder directories, word, excel, access and other apps becomes difficult from beyond 15 feet or more do to font size. although, browsing the internet and gaming can be done easily from further distances with thanks to the 10ft hi resolution monitor cable.-i recommend bargaincell as an amazon retailer"
5,10ft Hi Resolution monitor cable (Male to Male),"I got this product so I could attach my computer to my 32"" LCD HDTV and it worked like a charm.. Good product for a good price. Also the transaction went smooth and it arrived quickly..Thank You,"
1,Horrible quality image,"I don't ask much from my cables, i just ask that they take the output from my computer and put the image on my screen without lines missing. I am sorry to say that this cable could not even live up to my hopes. I have missing lines that constantly flicker on my screen. Its almost like 90% of the lines are being refreshed each time and the rest are left blank and its dizzying to look at. It is not my computer as i plug it in to other monitors and even my tv and everything is fine, and its not my monitor because whatever i plug the cable into it into exhibits the annoying line problem. Beware of bad QC."
2,oops2,"i have receivfd the correct cord but it dosen't work , when connected from the monitor to the cpu it reads no connection.when another cord is used monitor works correctly. thank you"
2,I don't think this product goes through QC,"Super flimsy. One head was put together so the shield was backwards. I had to pop off the shield and use it that way instead. Im afraid to move it around much, but its working. for the price, i guess its what i should have expected."
2,cheap,"This cable turned my display yellow and the cable was very temperamental, we had to prop it on a book and have it twisted a certain way to make it work sometimes. Maybe it was defective but I forgot to return it by the deadline and it wouldn't be worth it to pay for shipping to return it. I did like the length of it though."
1,very bad product,"very bad quality of product. The VGA connector was cracked and pins were bent. after fixing that, when I connected to monitor, it would not carry video for 1980x1050 resolution from my laptop to 55"" TV. Don't buy this item."
2,"Works, but just barely","After having some troubles with the cable I read some of the reviews and I am having the same problems as other users (blurry display, poor image quality). It seems the cable does not allow communication between the monitor and the computer to allow the computer to enable the proper drivers. In hind site I should have spent a couple dollars more to get a little bit better quality cable."
1,Junk,"Junk. Don't waste your money. Only five pins wired through, no plug and play functionality. Poorly shielded cable, lots of ghosting."
2,meh...,"first off, i ordered with expedited shipping (guaranteed 3 days), but it still came in 4 (not counting sunday) :/also, mine is not 9' 10'', more like 5', i ordered this under the assumption i would have 10' of cable, nope.i mean it works, im grateful for that, but im not really happy otherwise..these cheap peripherals are a gamble, i've bought plenty, but there is always at least one thing wrong."
2,"Cheap cable, cheap quality, waste of money","I bought this to connect my PC to a 40"" Toshiba TV which I had tested successfully with another monitor cable. When I replaced the existing cable with this one two things happened 1) Aspect Ratio changed automatically to 4:3 and 16:9 was not available anymore! 2) The picture and color quality changed dramatically. I'm returning it. Too bad I was looking to enjoy it."
5,awesome!,"guys this product is awesome,but peaple who say this is is one star oviosly dont know how to work this thing"
5,VGA cable,It is working fine. And the length was great. And a good price. I should have ordered more. I was glad they had sold it for an affordable price.
4,Works,I received the cable in a very timely manner and it does what it's supposed to do. Nothing special about this cable. I have no problems with it and that's all I needed.
1,cheap cable didn't save me $,got the cable in a timely fashion but it didn't work with either of my computers on my extension monitor or TV...since the cost to return it for a REFUND is as much as it did to buy it I've chalked it up to realizing you get what you pay for-that must be why the Belkin version is $20 instead of less than $5.
1,DOA,The cable is either DOA or my application of it uses 1 or more of the _10_ pins that aren't wired!
1,Junk cable.,"Tried this cable to get a little more distance, but ended up having to return it. The screws on the cable to secure it to the monitor and computer were poorly machined and nearly impossible to screw in, and once I finally had it attached, my previously recognized Dell monitor was now a ""Generic Non-PnP"" monitor, and the image ghosting was insane. Put my old (shorter) cable back on, and sent this one back to Amazon. Thank goodness for Amazon's simple return process."
3,The Quality is OKAY,"I think it's an okay VGA cable. When the product says hi -resolution, it's more like a camera optical zooming onto a bigger screen. The cable itself is pretty long asnd I just leave it behind my HDTV. My Acer says it reccomends the lower res. because of the VGA cable. The cable is also pretty fast. I would reccomend this if a friend needed a long cable with a satisfactory res. It's perfect for watching movies and videos on fullscreen."
3,"When the cable fits, it works well.","When the cable fits, it works well.I'm not sure if the connectors are cheap or what, but they simply do not fit the interfaces like the more expensive cable I bought from Target does.I would not buy this cable again because I cannot use it in all my set-ups, unlike the more expensive cable."
1,Poor Quality,After receiving the cable I installed it on my digital menu player and it did not work. After 2 hours of trouble shooting our media player we looked at the cables and found the cable we just purchased had a pin pushed in 3/4 of the way and would not work.
1,BAD BUY 0,"This was the biggest waste of money ever, the picture is very poor and I regret this purchase every time I turn on my computer, there are lines across the screen that are very distracting and I hate it. If I where you I would spend the money on a name brand that works."
1,very low quality,"terrible cable, ghosting is very evident. Probably cheap and inadequate shielding. I wonder if theferrite cores are real, probably fake. Hooked up my old more expensive cable and you can easily tellthe better quality..this is going back to Amazon. Amazon: this brand is NOT UP TO YOUR STANDARDS!"
3,Good,"The cord was correct, but would have liked a description heads-up that not all HDTVs have a VGA plug-in! Got here in the time frame given!"
4,Old Fashion,great to connect to apple products to pc if you there is no HDMI connection... it is useful to have in my computer bag
1,didnt work,"didnt work for connecting my laptop to my 32 inch tv, and there was some kind of buzzing on the tv, anyway it worked OK for my 19 inch monitor, but it still has some flaws with the monitor, had to buy a insulated grounded vga for the tv, that one works great. i still have to buy another vga cause this one sucks"
4,Decent Product,"Good product for the price. Not amazing, but does the job. One of the pins was slightly bent, but I used a knife to straighten it out and no problems."
5,Just what I needed,"Ran it through my wall with no issues to use my tv as a monitor and now I can browse the net on my 72"" plasma, WINNING!!!"
2,ghosting and other problems,"i have like weird line's that shoot out at every end of the screen whenever i open up any window or a grid line wavy lines whenever playing games or movies....not like a digital glitch more like shadowing.....basically now i'll have to cut up the cable to shorten it and see if that fixes the problem, i've understood the extra length cables often causes problems like thisi was just hoping i wouldnt have to put up with thisif i'm able to fix this problem the cable will be perfect"
1,Worked for 2 months then fell apart,Was working fine but base of cord started to come out of base of plug and screen turns blue constantly! I guess you get what you pay for. Probably worth spending a few extra dollars on a better quality item.
1,Does not work,"I should have read other reviews before purchasing this cable. This cable does NOT work with my Samsung 20'' TV/Monitor and HP laptop. The TV/Monitor does not recognize that it is plugged into the computer, but the computer sees it as a ""Generic Monitor"" when it should be picking up more information than that. Other reviews suggested that there is no plug & play capability with this cable (not all pins are wired), so that could be it. Either way, it did not work, and I am disappointed.Furthermore, the cable was damaged when it arrived but not in a way that would impede function. The metal was bent on one end but it still plugged in. It's just poorly made in general. Don't waste your time (or money, but I feel I spent more time than money on this right now). I've purchased many cheap cables before - there USUALLY is no difference in quality. This time there was."
1,This product does not function properly.,"I assumed that because this product cost $1.02 + $2.95 shipping when I bought it, instead of the $3 to $'11 of other options, it might wear out faster, but that ultimately it would work the same. Unfortunately, I was vastly disappointed.Any monitor used with this cable has a horizontal ""smear"": all colors appear in lighter horizontal lines to the right. This isn't noticeable in fast-moving images such as movies or video games, but it's irritating for text editing and makes image editing impossible, since you don't know what you're seeing.While I was removing and re-attaching this cable to different monitors and ports, one of the screws on the cable came loose and fell out of the unit. This was just under normal use, with absolutely no unnecessary stress placed on it. A few reattachments later, another screw had fallen out.While not completely useless, I would never recommend this product to anyone who had another option."
4,It was okay.,"This was a very typical product: it was everything that I expected to be, but it was not too classy."
4,Very nice cable,"Is nice quality cable. Pretty well made, nice connections. Works like a charm. Would buy another one of these cables."
1,Cheap Product,Don't buy this product. Spend a little more and you can get a much superior product. This thing is cheap and the construction reflects that. I would suggest Cable2Go (C2G) product. It works so much better. I will never buy this product again!!
5,works fine,if you need VGA extension this is your thing.no problems at all.very cheap too.if you go to best buy they make you pay like [...] at least for an item like this.but this is cheap and gets the job done!YAY AMAZON!
2,Doesn't work well,"It doesn't work with HP LE2201w. If I plug it into the monitor and set the resolution 1680*1050 60Mhz, the monitor only display part of the screen. I think this cable only works with low resolution less than 1366*768. I plug this into syncmaster 175s. At least, it works this time but gives a blurry image."
5,Works well.,I purchased this so I could connect my macbook (about a year old) to a dvi to vga to sony tv and it did not work because of the tv/mac problems however it does work with other tvs very well with pcs.
3,Works good if you only need picture,This item works very good if you only want to use it to hook you laptop to your TV screen. It won't transmit audio. If you need audio you will need to buy the one that come with an audio cable too.
1,i wish i could give it a zero star,This is one of the most inferior item i've purchased on amazon. this cable has so much ghosting that if you keep using it for a few month you might go blind. i had to use it for 15 min for some important work and i had headache because of it. Do not buy this one and look for some branded ones.
1,Sucky company,I have yet to receive this item from this company and I ordered it way back in November so please don't waste your hard earned money like I did on this product.
2,Quality VERY grainy,"I got this and the way it made the screen look was very grainy, but the cord was super long!!! So it was worth the money.... just put a ** review bc of the way made the screen look............."
5,works fine,"This works fine. It's a pretty standard cable, but even so I was a little nervous to get the cheapest one ... but it works!"
1,Horrible,"Very low quality picture. I hadn't experienced a bad VGA cable until this one. I knew I wasn't paying for the best but wow, the poor quality made this a horrible cable no matter how low the price."
5,Just what I neded,Perfect for what I needed. Highly recomended if you need to move your monitor on a large desk.
3,not so satisfied,"the picture is clear , but waves through the tv screen make it bad, i tried all the setting without success. i can't compare to other cable because this is my first one."
4,VGA Cable Adequate,"This product is well constructed, but the screw fittings on each end are a tad flimsy. Cable works for the most part, but buyer beware. VGA is not digital, and if you attempt to connect a VGA cable from your compouter to an LCD TV, some compatability issues may arise between certain Cables and certain TVs. I connected mine from a Gateway Laptop with Vista to a 46"" Samsung and a 26"" Dynex with no problems."
1,It is not hd cable,"The cable is not hd at all. If use this cable to connect hdtv, u are no where near the 1080p resolution.I also dont think it is a 15 pin cable."
4,Works great for the price,"Perfect vga cable at an incredible price!You get what you pay for though. The pins are easily bent so be careful. When unplugging cable after first use I noticed it bent 2 pins that prevented it from being reconnected. Easy enough to straighten out but you can tell the quality of the metal components are on the low end. If you plan on connecting this cable and forgetting about it, then this deal can't be beat. If you need to remove and reconnect this cable on a regular basis I would look for another one.All in all this is a decent cable and I would purchase again for my uses."
4,Positive,"Dear Amazon,I received this fine cord as a replacement for a defective cord and was very pleased to experience the considerate customer care demonstrated by my vendor.I trust this serves to eliminate any negative feedback that may originate from me.Thank you for the opportunity to respond about the product.All the best,Mark Zanger"
2,Worked good for a little while,"I bought this to play movies on my computer and watch on my TV. After a few months, the end that connects to the computer stopped working and I had to loop the wire under by computer to keep pressure on the connection. I thought my computer might be the issue so I tried another wire. The second one (different brand) worked fine, and still works."
1,Not good as expected,I noticed one point was damaged. I made some adjustments and am using it since returning it would cost extra $$
1,Trash,Do not buy it does not work.buy a hdmi better those work better.so do not not buy buy.buy beer instead
1,Low quality and doesn't support more than 1024 by 764 pixels,I bought this cable thinking that all the VGA cables are the same. However my idea was wrong because I could learn that this cable doesn't support more than 1024 by 764 pixels. My computer monitor is 21 inches and if I use the VGA cable that came with the computer I have higher resolution options for the monitor display. When I use this VGA cable it gives monitor quality option only up to 1024 by 764 pixels. So if you have a bigger computer monitor or if you want to use this cable for a bigger screen I don't recommend this cable. Hope this helps!!
1,Blurry,"It's obvious this cable works for some people based on the reviews. It doesn't work for me. It's blurry. I bought 5 cables for a couple workstations. They create very blurry picture on any VGA monitor. I tried other VGA cables on the video cards and they are fine. These cables are junk for me... I really can't see how they are a treasure for other people, but maybe I'm just unlucky.(Tried on 3 ViewSonic VA2431wm monitors)."
2,Make sure what you need,"I should have read some of the negative reviews more closely. This cable does not appear to be shielded and therefore can distort or just have general issues with picture quality because of that. I purchased this and had scrolling lines on my LCD monitor. I ordered a shielded cable and the problem went away. If you do not need shielded cable in your application, then this may work fine, but I'm not sure how you would know in advance. Better to spend just a few dollars more and get the shielded cable instead."
1,This cord sucks,"My last VGA cable started displaying my monitor as red, yellow, blue, or green sepia style images. I figured it was time for a new cable. I purchased this cable and plugged it in 20 minutes ago.I am not impressed.There are static lines that run through the screen as if there is an old antenna which doesn't have the right connection. The only issue is that there are no rabbit ears to adjust. After trying to adjust my screen resolution about a hundred times, I gave up. Even though I got this POS free through my amazon points, I think I'm going to return it for spite."
1,Terrible!,"Tried this cable with an Acer 19"" (square) flat panel. Immediately noticed significant blurriness and horizontal ghosting. I would NOT recommend this cable AT ALL."
1,Don't buy!,"The cable was very difficult to put into the TV and computer. Then no matter what I did, there was no reception through the cable. I bought the cheapest thing I could find, I guess I couldn't expect too much."
1,Very Bad Quality,"This brand of cable is of a very bad quality, and not shielded properly. With this cable the monitor has very bad streaking, seen especially on text that looks like someone smeared it across the screen. Avoid this one at all costs."
1,Complete JUNK,"Cable did not support EDID so it would not support 1920x1080 resolution that I need. Item did not match pictures or description. NO ferrites, 14pins not 15, and does not support ""high resolution monitors and high quality signal transmission"" as claimed in the description."
4,Does a fair job,"I needed to attach an older monitor to my laptop, but I did not have the right cable to do the job. When I found this deal online I could not resist. Unfortunately the monitor proved not to work, but I was able to connect this to my new HDTV. I realized immediately that we are getting used to high definition these days. The picture quality is fuzzy at best when compared to an HDMI connection between the two devices. Overall I am pleased, but I cannot rely on this for sharpness or color accuracy when working on images or videos. The 10' length is plenty, but may contribute to the loss of image quality. The knobs to fasten come loose (fall out of plug) if not used, and they do not have slots in them to use a screwdriver. However, for the price I am very satisfied."
2,You get what you pay for.,I wanted this cable to hook my PC to my Television. After I hooked it up I noticed horizontal lines across the screen. They do not totally disrupt the image but are very distracting when watching a show. I tried my old cable that I use for my monitor and it worked perfectly so I know it is the cable that is at fault. I didn't pay much for this cable and I didn't get much out of it. I am currently looking for a better cable and I would suggest you do to.
3,didnt need it,"the product purchased to work with it came with , also wish hadn't the product i use it on but its good cable came quick"
1,Blurry connection,"I needed a VGA cable for my self-built computer, and I was disappointed with this purchase. The screen is blurry when it is connected, and I know this is not due to outside variables because I borrowed other VGA cables that work fine."
2,no ferrite beads,have not used this yet---i thought it would have ferrite beads---it does noti`m deciding if i should use it or not---without them
2,It worked... once,It works when it feels like it. Sometimes it'll just stop working. I used it for my tower to HDTV and others to test it. Wouldn't buy it again.
3,Does not work with Samsung Syncmaster 226BW,"I had long since lost the cord for my Samsung Syncmaster 226BW monitor. The computer is able to show a picture on the monitor, but the plug and play feature does not recognize it as a Samsung monitor, preventing you from adjusting the resolution to get a clear picture. It may work fine on other devices, so maybe its just a Samsung issue. You can't beat the price, that's for sure."
2,I bought the wrong product.,"I decided to keep the product for future use, but it arrived on time, and in new condition. I'm sure it works fine and is a good product."
1,No,Hardly works. Company doesn't respond when questioned. They wouldn't process my complaints over a month ago. Wouldn't cancel my order when requested before payment even went through.Absolutely terrible. Do not buy!
1,"super low quality, screen flickers",I recommend against this cable. I got one and the screen flickers and the computer doesn't recognize the monitor. I plug in another vga cable and no flickering and the computer immediately knows the model of the monitor.
1,Something wrong with the cable,"After less than a year of use, my monitor starting turning pink. First I thought my monitor was broken and I was ready to buy a new monitor. My wife suggested that I try using a new cable and I did. When using a different cable, the pink ting was gone... so it must be due to the cable. Be careful when you buy cheap cables."
1,BLURRY!,"It says high resolution, not the case. If you have an older low res set up, then maybe this is for you. However, if you want a clear picture on a monitor with a higher resolution.....do not waste your money. Yeah, it's only $4, but you really do get what you pay for. My other cable, which is 6 years old, has a way clearer picture than this cable provides. And returning the cable is not economical. Learn from my mistake."
1,Not a good VGA cable,"Caused colors to ""smear"" and black text to pixelize on my Samsung 943BT monitor. I replaced it with a 6-foot Samsung cable with ferrites on each end and now the display is crisp again."
1,Does not work.,"I bought this cable to connect my HP laptop to my Sony Bravia 52 inch TV. My laptop recognizes the cable but the TV does not. I have never had this problem with any other VGA cable. Highly disappointed with this purchase, I thought I was saving money but I was just wasting my time."
2,not worth it,"I should have listened to the other reviews. I could only reach 1600 resolution instead of 1920 from my other VGA cable. I put it on my 21"" monitor and it had crappy resolution and blinked an error message.Save your money and buy something from the store."
1,Disappointed,"Bought a bunch of these and a lot of them either didn't work, or the image was blurry. Spent a few hundred on a lot of them for a computer lab and, well, we haven't been able to set up those new monitors because of all the bad cables we got."
3,"Good, unless you touch or move it.","This is a good plug, but if you wiggle the cord at all it causes blur on the monitor. Would not recommend buying, but since I don;t touch my 3rd monitor ever it really doesn't make a difference to me."
5,Nikon URE8 Adaptor,"An essential component for those getting more functionality out of their camera and who want to use the zoom lens. No longer available from the company, so this is a great find."
1,not for Glock 22 40 S&W,this mag holder may work great for the Glock 9mm's but it won't hold a Glock 22 40 s&w double stack mag. If you're shooting a Glock 22 don't buy this product.
3,Not for young kids,"The music is great but the cartoons are stressful and violent in the old ""Tom and Jerry"" way. Too bad. This could have been much better."
4,Empowering!,This book helped me to come to terms with what I've been going through for the last 5 years and to make a plan to move forward.
4,great information,The information confirmed that I wasn't imagining what was happening to me. Very scary that this is so prevalent that numerous books and articles are being written about the subject.
2,Disappointed,This 'new edition' is the same as the older version. How disappointing when authors repackage their old work with a new cover and say 'all new'. I expected more from this write up and would not recommend you purchase this book.
4,Required reading for any employee of Bell Atlantic/Verizon,No employee should be without this book! I believe that this book was also mentioned in an excellent employee newsletter called the Employee...TheEmployee@aol.com
2,Just find another job,"A good book, but not very helpful. There are some great resources and referrals available, and some good ideas, I just don't think that the book addresses itself to the severity of the issue. Very high and optimistic thinking, but seemed to offer quite naive advice relative to the issue."
2,no,"The book, shipping, etc. was fine. The content though was pretty worthless. It identified what bullying is throughout the book. I think anyone who is going through it KNOWS they're being bullied. I was hoping for more info on legal aspects, solutions...if that's what you're looking for, this book is not it."
2,This Book Is Not The Answer,"This book starts off by praising the authors, and then does very little to justify it. The authors create false categories of ""bullies"". The book is riddled with contradictions that makes one wonder if it was actually edited. The entire value of the book is that it does inform the reader that (1) bullies need to harm and control others, (2) that's just the way they are - don't try to understand them, and (3) do not suffer because there are ways to deal with it. I suggest you find those ways in another book. I was recommened ""Jerks at Work."""
2,Policy over Practical,"The book begins very slowly and really does not offer significant information until the last few chapters (mostly the very last chapter). The authors, throughout the entire novel, have a bitter attitude towards business in general and seem to be blaming capitalism for the problems surrounding bullying. They have several interesting points throughout the novel, but unfortunately, it is mired down by a slightly veiled political agenda against ""big business"". I would like to have seen more about the practical methods an individual can undertake to control bullying rather than the overhanded solution to engage in legal discourse.I would have also liked to have seen more specific case studies. The authors mention many times of having their web site with hundreds of stories on bullying. Where are they? I would like to have seen more. Keep the politics out of the issue. It is serious enough of a problem without smacking of a hidden agenda against business."
5,"""The Bully at Work""","I want to thank Dr.s Gary and Ruth Namie for writing this book. I was working in a doctor's office that has a bullying manager who has caused the resignation of two doctors, three medical assistants, and seven RNs in the period of the four years I was there. The environment of the institution fostered this behavior and she was actually promoted recently. This book clarified her behavior and reinforced my decision to leave. I am in contact with the other staff who have left and we are now passing the book around. What a great service this is providing!"
4,Review of The Bully at Work,An excellent book .Better than the 2nd Edition for practical information on dealing with the situation of a Bully at Work.
5,A Tonic for Healing the Self Esteem of the Bullied,This book mirrors my life experiences with workplace bullying. It helps to read that bullying is a reality and I am not paranoid. Knowledge is power and this book makes me more assertive and stronger.
2,Good if you need to feel validated,"There a couple of useful pages that discuss how to deal with a bully one-on-one, but most of it discusses how it is not your fault and tells you how to walk out of the bully workplace environment. I was hoping that it would give more guidance in how to disarm a bully and avoid becoming a Target at all. The first sentence of the Introduction is ""A simple truth: to stop a bully from turning you into a Target, ""just"" coldly and unemotionally announce that the irrational, unwanted conduct you are experiencing is unacceptable."" I wish that the book had elaborated on that very topic."
5,Definitive advice for workplace bullying targets,"The Bully at Work (2009 edition) is a significant update of a pathbreaking book. Although written specifically for targets of bullying, it will be useful to managers, human resource officers, union leaders, lawyers, mental health providers, researchers, and educators in any field involving employment relations. This is the book I recommend to people when they contact me for guidance and assistance about bullying situations they are facing at work.My recommendation of this book is concededly far from objective. I have worked with the Namies for over a decade to advance legal protections for targets of severe workplace bullying, and they are both friends and partners. Our working alliance has flourished in large part because I regard them as North America's foremost experts on the impact of workplace bullying and what individuals and organizations can do to respond to these destructive behaviors."
5,What a relief...I'm OK,"Within the first few pages of this book it was able to give me confirmation and validation of my feelings, unlike after seeking much advice from consultants, and professional readings when you are left with a feeling of helplessness, where you the victim is left feeling somewhat to blame and the only answer is for you to leave. But what happens if you love your work just not the way some people treat you? This book very quickly and simply empowered me with strategies for 'reclaiming my diginity', simple strategies which took little or no courage to carry out but made a huge impact on the way I work in this environment. I recommend this book to anyone who needs to believe in themselves again and anyone who never wants to go down this road so can be armed with proactive strategies."
5,"TELL IT LIKE IT IS, AND GET THAT BULLY OFF YOUR BACK !!","I ordered Bully at Work, I receivied it, and I just placed an order for two more books for my friends. This book is a must for ALL. The information can be applied to all aspects of your life. That Big Bully at Work will wonder where you got your courgage to STAND PROUD, SHOULDERS BACK, AND HEAD HELD HIGH! I feel like a new person and I have not finished the book. Thanks Gary and Ruth Namie, I love your book. Keep up the good work. I will apply many of the items in the book to my work place. Five stars are not enough for this book."
2,Dissappointed,"After waiting over fifteen minutes for the program to load, I discovered that in order to open most of the advertised manuals, one needs to own the hard copy of the same. Why did I pay over $100 for software if I need to buy more books?Anyone with a mind for kenetics and first-year calculus can synthesize data. Futhermore, most of these ""extra"" manuals don't include my caliber. This is BS on RCBS' part!"
4,Excellent form factor with a silly value-add,As a flash drive it's really well engineered. The 'Virtual expander' stuff is nonsense that only works on windows and barely at that. Deleted it straight away and now it's a very nice little flash drive.
5,"Eloquent, funny, un-put-downable","Wall is an eloquent master of narrative and description. His landscapes are almost tactile. He captures the touch and smell and the visual elements of Ireland and the sea until you almost see what he's writing about. But his books also have powerful plots. Two of my friends read this book at a single sitting. His hero is hateful and loveable by turns and you end up hoping against hope that everything will work out, even though you know from the first chapter that it can't be. Or at least you think you know from the beginning that it can't be...The narrator (also the hero) is so funny too. It's full of wit and sly irony.Set in a city first, then in a seaside town, he actually succeeds in the transition so that both settings are totally credible. There's a strong message there too, a warning about what Ireland is becoming with its new wealth."
1,Very dull,"This might have been an interesting read if the entire book hadn't fallen into the trap of telling rather than showing. Beran, the story's main character, is a cardboard cutout who doesn't really have a soul to sell. If there'd been more to the writing than Beran did this, then this, met so and so, wore fine/ratty clothes, did this, met a nice/evil/indifferent man, did this, went out on the road, and did this, The Juggler may have received more than one star from me."
1,Not a drop of pomegranate,"This is a pretty bad immitation of real grenadine. Very mediciny taste. Ingredients are corn syrup, dextrose and such. You get the idea. No wonder it is so cheap."
3,cute cover,"This snap on cover for the sync cell phone is very brightly colored and makes my phone easy to find and very cute! The only problem is where it attaches to the top of the cell phone by the camera tends to break off fairly quickly, then it no longer is able to stay attached to the phone. It is the design flaw. I have had several of these covers and they all do the same thing."
2,Not an easy reference,"Thought the info was probably all here but didn't like that it wasn't clearly presented: the editing (too wordy) and organization of the materials seemed weak. Probably just a bit dated. I recommend Terry Hewitt's ""Complete Book of Cacti & Succulents."""
2,Good for a Beginner,For a beginner the book is OK. The pictures are very nice too. It also gives information on the temperture and conditions to grow cactus. I am happy to have this book in my collection of cactus books. I was happy at the reasonable price of this book too.Louise
3,Not the best.,This is good for you if you want a cheap CD holder for the car or just to get them out of the way but it is not that stable. If your more concerned about the price that the quality then buy it. It's really small so you can't fit that many CDs in it if you want the CD booklets in there with them. Also another thing I don't like about it is that it dosn't have a spot for your CD player which is a notible feature in a CD case.
4,Good read for any jaguar enthusiast,This is quite a readable biography of Sir William Lyons and essentially the history of Jaguar up until his retirement and death. It is well written and not as dry as many biographies.
5,Genius... pure genius,"Every tune on the CD is brilliant. This is a classic piece of Canadian music history... one of the best albums to come out of this country.... ever. I would place this up there with classic Canadian albums like Rush's Moving Pictures. The first track ""All the Things I Wasn't"" is beautiful beyond belief. This band truly had talent... get this album, it's perfect. Not an exaggeration."
4,Who's Who in Our Lives,"Amazing story about how we never really know who others are, and even who we really are. We can't know if what people say is true, unless you are able to see them in a tight situation, through which they show their true colors. I can't see how this book hasn't become more popular, it really is a great sequal to it's even better partner, Violet Eyes."
5,Kids love this book!,"I do a monthly Mother Goose story hour for my moms group and the kids always clamor for this book, usually begging me to read it at least two times, if not more. I've never had a book get such a postive reaction from so many kids.The rhyming is delightful and fun to read. I normally just get books from the library, but this one is so popular I had to purchase it."
2,Don't get this unless you like pushing buttons,"I think this is bright enough for cars to see you on a lighted road, and it has 3 different modes. So far so good. What I don't understand is why there is no way to turn it on/off without going through all 3 different modes every single time.This means that if you don't want to use any of the flashing modes you have to press the button 3 times to turn it off! My almost 10 year old cat-eye taillight let me switch between settings with a short press on the button, while keeping it pressed down slightly longer turned it off (or on to the previously used setting if it was turned off).This was my first Blackburn purchase, so one of the deciding reasons for me was that it comes with a ""lifetime guarantee"" -- thus I figured Blackburn had put some thought into it. I was wrong."
2,Inadequate mounting,"The LEDs are quite bright, and will last longer than either conventional incandescent or halogen bulbs. They also conserve battery power to an amazing extent. Unfortunately thet clip that holds the lamp to the handlebar mount is so small and weak that after attaching/detaching the lamp a few times it will begin to detach itself at every bump in the road."
2,Looks can be deceiving...,"My bike is my main source of transportation, day and night. I bought this inexpensive light hoping it would make my night commutes safer and brighter.This light doesn't provide enough light to see in urban areas or pitch black paths. The beam is very weak. To see the path ahead of me I have to tilt the light towards the ground, than the bean is brighter. But than the bean is just two feet ahead of my tire - giving me no time to swerve out of the way of any obstructions on the road.If you want a light to be seen, than yes, this is a good light (it has a nice blinking mode). But if you want a light to see, forget this one and invest in a safer, brighter light."
3,"Good light, needs better mount",Unable to maintain a tight clamp on my Minoura Spacebar - bumps will jar the light either up/down or left right.
4,Great light,"I've had this light over an year now, only had to replace the batteries once so far. It is very bright and gets good distance. I ride in San Fransisco and there is tons of traffic. The light does help in showing that I am near by, I feel naked when I don't have it on. It has taken some beatings but has managed to function properly without any problems. Aesthetically it is a bit bulky, but pretty, slim lights don't make me feel safer."
5,Exactly what I expected!,This book was on my wish list for months - and with a gift certificate from my son I finally rewarded myself with this gorgeous nursing history. It was expensive but worth the money. The part I couldn't know by the preview online is that the color plates showing nursing through the years are just as wonderful as I hoped.
4,Optimal for beginners in the field,"Judging from this volume, Annett seems to be a great teacher and a great writer.The distance between the material covered here and actual research is quite large, but that's OK, since the book is advertised as a pedagogical introduction, and it is really good at that.Every chapter includes a number of smartly-chosen problems, the solutions to which are given in an Appendix.I have given the book 4 stars instead of 5, because it suffers from horrendous copy-editing. Grammatical mistakes, typos in equations, wrong references to previous equations (and the list goes on). One gets the feeling that the publisher received the author's manuscript and published it as is. This makes it very difficult to understand why it's so expensive. Hopefully these errors will be removed in a future edition."
2,Better than nothing,"I'm sorry to say I was not exactly thrilled when I tasted this brand of ""Branston"" or ploughman's pickle. There is a high proportion of ""sauce"" to veggies, and the flavor is blander than I like. I also reviewed the Crosse and Blackwell Branston Original (much better, IMO) and would recommend it over the Heinz.I noticed that this is packed in Holland. Don't know if that has anything to do with anything but seems odd. The crunchy bits are not quite as crunchy as I like, and it's soupy, rather than being thick. It's not a terrible product, but I believe the Heinz is higher priced than the C&B;, so I'd recommend that for more flavor and crunch and less drips."
3,Excellent series for high school girls,"This series is excellent, I only wish the 8th book was still in print!"
3,This is not trance music.,"When I buy this CD, I was looking for trance music and disc 2 is labeled ""Trance"", but is closer to be new age, except for two tracks. CD 1 is house music and I'm sure it's right for the ones who love House. Track 5 ""Babbel Fish"" is excellent, but the song finishes suddenly, turning down the volume like an amateur does it. Finally, the DVD is interesting and it has a really good quality sound. This compilation is not for me (I love trance)."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable with a fascinating and interesting plot,I have read several of Bruce Zimmerman's books and find them to be very easy to get absorbed into the plot. The author is knowledgeable on the subject of each of his books and the area that is portrayed in each book. I understand that he has another book out and am waiting for the opportunity to read it.
5,Fantastic for dental photography,"I recently bought this light for use in my dental practice. After looking for expensive ring flaslights, this cool light is simply great. One of the features i like more is that when you use a ring flashlight in dental photography you need to close off all the other light sources, which means you have them on, you focus, you turn them off and you shoot the photo. With the cool light the light is allready on before and after the shot.ONE OF THE BEST PRICE-QUALITY ITEMS I'VE FOUND."
2,"It works great, but there's just not enough of it.","I bought this case when I purchased my player and it seemed to work great, but as I made more mini-discs I began to realize how small it really was. It is good until you try to make many songs off an extensive variety of CD's. I suggest a binder by Conductor Series so you can add as many pages as you need."
5,Great case,"This is a fantastic device for carrying minidiscs, but I can see a few changes that can be made. For instants, I think it should include a built-in TV, a sony laptop, an apartment on Park Ave, and a small dog (preferably a poodle)."
4,A Sampling of Methods of Investigating the Past,"Unsolved History looks at a series of historical mysteries, from lost texts to establishing identities, from ancient riddles to suspect documents. The puropose of each of these drawn out examples is to show the readers the variety of ways an historical researcher can set about determining the truth. The book's strength is in the variety of cases examined and the quite different investigative means used. The author, Joe Nickell, uses a number of cases he was personally involved in, although without bogging the stories down with too much personal data. The focus always remains on the mystery at hand. It is a small book and an easy read but it should leave the reader with a greater interest in the mysteries of the past and the possible answers they may someday reveal."
2,Modem blues,"I purchesed linspire 5.0 expecting an easy time. But, I have the linux modem blues. I have sucessfully installed modems with redhat 9 and lycoris, but with linspire I am surprised to be having such hassles. A usb external wasn't seen. I yanked my pci modem and put in an agere chipset modem. Linspire sees it, but I get a 'no dial tone' window. I reboot witht the same computer into windows 2000 and the modem works fine. Really, if this is supposed to be such an easy distro of linux, why haven't they resolved this stuff? I find little information on the linspire web site. And of course, without a working modem, the cnr is totally useless! So, here I am going on to modem #3, scouring the web trying to find something compatible. Arrgh!"
5,Great bundle: OS + lots of software,"Linspire is a great operating system, easy to use, yet powerful enough for all of your needs. And with the CNR subscription, you will have a one-click access to many programs. It can't get any easier than this. I've been using Linspire full time since January and I am sure there is no way I will ever go back to Windows."
1,Linspire? Use Ubuntu instead.,"Linspire takes a free (as in beer and as in speech) Linux distribution known as Debian, and then charges for the ""service"" of downloading software from a repository that is about 1/7th the size of the Debian repositories. If you wish ease of use, and adhere to the Debian ideal, get yourself a free-of-charge copy of Ubuntu courtesy of http://shipit.ubuntu.com, and then access the Ubuntu and Debian archives WITHOUT having to subscribe to anything."
3,Bed Head Dual Waver,"Shipped fast in clean new Condition. If you like the ""messy"" lookthis is good for you."
5,Excellent guide for tramping in the austrian alps,"Having used the book as a guide on some of the walks described in the book, I found it to be a top notch guide book as well as containing a number of useful suggestions. Anyone who is interested in going hiking in spectacular scenery should strongly consider Austria and Mr. Hurdle's book. Using the guide along with the detailed maps available everywhere in Austria is the perfect way to find your way around the mountains."
2,for seious walkers only,"I am planning to trek in Alps with my wife and a 3-years old kid. I thought of a hut-to-hut concept, and this is exactly what appears in the book's title, that's how I bought it.Though while reading the book I found very little information that would suit for my needs. There is no difficulty rating. There is no way to get a brief idea about the difficulty level of a trail unless you read through the entire chapter. Didn't find any ""easy"" treks that would be suitable for kids."
3,"Not bad, but....","I have been fascinated with the DeFeo murders for years.Like Ric Osuna, I read the Amityville Horror as a kid. I kinda figured out the whole ""Horror"" part of it, was a hoax after book sequals kept coming out. But.. to this day.. not having the entire truth come concerning the murders is intersting to say the least.I think Ric Osuna's book ""The Night the Defeo's Died"" is as close as we'll get to finding out.As for this documentary... not bad, but you can tell it ended in a way that a "" part 2"" was supposed to come out. Not sure that will happen, so it kind of leaves you hanging.The crime scene phot's are not for the weak of heart. There is one of Louise that was quite disturbing. My only problem with this film is that I think ""Geraldine"" is a fraud, but she is amusing to watch non the less...."
1,Look elsewhere,"I ordered this for my children for Christmas. My first complaint is how long it took for this item to arrive at my door. I ordered many other things at the same time I ordered this tetherball set. All of my other purchases arrived in less then 10 days. The tetherball set took close to 4 weeks. I can look past this tough, it was near Christmas after all and it was a big package to ship. But what I can't look past is the fact that I didn't get any directions and they didn't send the correct hardware to put the tetherball set together. The set comes with two poles that you must bolt together to make one long 10 foot pole. I didn't get a bolt to connect the two sections (they sent a bolt but it didn't fit and was useless). I had to go to a hardware store and buy my own bolts. I was very unhappy with this purchase and I strongly urge anyone looking at getting this to look at another set."
5,Flexclips document holders,"The products arrived quickly. One was damaged and, after contacting the supplier, a new one was shipped. Would purchase products from them again"
3,Fair is Fair in Book Reviews,"To quote from your 3 star negative review of ""The Great American Heart Hoax: Lifesaving Advice Your Doctor Should Tell You about Heart Disease Prevention (But Probably Never Will)""""I haven't read this book and it may well be a worthwhile discussion of preventive medicine...........""I reply to your book a 3 star recommendation because....""I haven't read this book and it may well be a worthwhile discussion of Disease, Science and Medicine ............""I think that a Physician reviewing a book by another Physician deserves to experience the same sort of review that he has provided.Please remember how it feels to get a so-so review from someone who admits that he hasn't actually read the book."
1,Poor Design,"The container does keep the bread fresh, however, it can be extremely difficult to open. I spent a good 30 minutes trying to pry the thing apart and proceeded to throw it out. If re-designed with a simpler way to get to the bread it could work. Other Desidry products I have work well."
5,Go Big Blue!,"LOVE this hat! fits PERFECTLY! Item came exactly as described within a few days of purchasing - exceptional service! Tried other websites (even the league's website) but this style ""NY"" was not available."
3,Tastefully Painted Visions,"Brenda, Joylynn, Kayla & Tamara all made for a great collaboration. Together these stories offer us tasty,graphic visions. After reading all the stories, it's plain to see that love & passion conquers all, including the hardest of the bad boys. So, curl up with either your piece, battery operated plastic or the phone near by just in case these explicit stories puts you at the verge of becoming ""The Hunter"" who ""Just Wanna Love Ya"" because you were ""Never Satisfied"" by a ""Fantasy Man""."
5,I love books with different stories and different authors,I thought all of them did a great job with there characters. I was afraid I'd be bored going from one author to the next but each story was pretty good.
1,Not the Cheetah Girls singing,My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas. It is advertised as the Cheetah Girls 2 - however these vocals are not sung by the original Cheetah Girls who are in the movie. The songs just don't sound the same. It's very dissappointing that Disney doesn't tell you this on the CD.
2,only worked for 8 months,"I purchased this product 8 months ago and use it regularly to backup my microsoft money data, well now it doesn't work ""device has malfuntioned"" so I have to get another one, will definitely purchase a different product for the second one."
5,Micro Sized....Monster Value!,"I've had the 2 gig model for about three years and I love it! I trimmed the littler rubber-like case and carry this in my wallet so I have it with me all the time. I can't even tell it's in my wallet but I can tell you it's great to have that drive available when you need it.So being in my wallet means it's sat on, abused, dropped, etc. and it works every time. Try that with a ""regular"" style thick USB drive.So if you're looking for a drive that is reliable and easy to carry, this is it."
4,Too Thin,"The design and colors are great, also the size, I just have a problem with my laptop because the Micro Vault is so thin that doesn't touch the contacts in the USB port. My laptop only recognize the device in 1 of 3 usb ports. I tried in other laptops and still have the same problem."
3,"Small, but slow!","In terms of size, this thing is great. Fits easily on a keychain and in your pocket.However, the trade-off for the small size is that it's SLLOOWWW. We're not talking like 5-10% slower... we're talking significantly slower than any other USB 2.0 drives. In fact, the speed of it feels closer to a USB 1.1 device.So if you need something strictly to hold some small files that you need to carry around and use infrequently, then it's fine. But if you plan on using this to transfer large files fairly regularly, I would highly recommend against it."
5,Great For My Sony BDP-S350 Blu Ray Player,"After purchasing my Sony BDP-S350, I realized a few features weren't available (BD Live, Bookmarks, etc) I tried a few USB flash drives I had laying around but they wouldn't fit into Sony's ""special"" sized EXT port on the back of the player.I purchased this item, and installed it in the back of the player, EXT lit up on the front display and all my options were available! Price was decent, and it does work with your standard USB port on a computer so its kinda ""double duty"" in that respect.Overall a great purchase if your looking to unlock the full potential of your BD player, or just need a REALLY tiny USB flash drive to keep your files, music, pictures, etc. Would buy again."
4,Really small device.,"This is really small, but has 2gb.I like it and I like to show it to my friends.But easy to lose. be careful!And virtual Expander program is kinda slow. Don't use the program when you transfer heavy files like movie."
1,pubic hair in packaging,There was a pubic hair in the packaging. Make your own with a hole punch and scissors.
2,Patti Page's beautiful voice is gone...,"What once was a lovely crystal-clear voice is now powerless. Although I may still listen to this from time-to-time, I will play my other classic Christmas albums instead. The singing is simply too weak. What a shame."
1,"After hearing this CD, I can see why it was so cheap.","I bought this CD thinking I was getting a deal, when in fact, I was buying the names of popular songs which are performed by 'THE COUNTDOWN DANCE MASTERS.' This CD is a big disappointment and big waste of time and money."
1,Egh....,Only two songs are maybe by the actual artist. The rest..good god their bad. Save your money.
1,Yuk!,"Really bad mixes. Absolutely not DJ friendly. And if you're not a DJ, the actual tracks are not even originals. They're perfomed by some other vocalists! Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!"
4,Good for Teachers,This is a good approach to 'teaching' poetry. Collins selects contemporary poems that students can relate to and sometimes laugh at. The website is very helpful in guiding teachers through Collins' philosophy of how to use poetry in the classroom.
4,A Fine Poetry Anthology,"In this anthology, edited by former poet laureate Billy Collins, we see many styles of poems. I originally purchased this book for a college poetry writing course but I found the poems pleasurable to read on my own time, not just to read for critical analysis. Collins' intro contains some insights as to how a poem forms for a writer and also a good story about a poetry reading. The anthology features many contemporary writers and the poems range in length and subject matter. If you are looking for a good poetry anthology to learn to read and/or write poetry, I heartily recommend this book. I think readers of any ages will enjoy it."
4,hummm,"well i love poetry, some of these were alright, some were way too out there, and others were amazing, i guess t depends on the reader, because a poem can mean one thing to you and another to me, that's the beauty of it, all in all...it was pretty neat to read!"
2,Very mediocre collection,Collins states in the introduction that he hadn't heard of many of these poets; I think the reason is that they aren't all that good.There are a few good poems interspered with some pretty pedestrian ones.This is sort of the hospital food of poetry...try to please everyone by upsetting no one.
1,"No, no, no, no, no, no, nO.","This is the worst possible way to interest someone in poetry: offering lackluster poems about adolescent topics by contemporary writers of little or no distinction. It makes poetry seem easy, trite, self-indulgent, and boring. Rarely have I so regretted a purchase.If you would instill a love of poetry in a young person, read them the great, lasting stuff. If it sparks no fire, then poetry is not for them."
4,Comprehensive reading about what is going on in China,"I liked reading it, I certainly enjoyed reading it more than any other book on China because it was logical and comprehensive. It is an easy-to-read book that follows the timeline of China into modern times. It is written by an expert on China. I loved it"
1,Did I read the wrong book?,"This book was absolutely horrible. It had nothing to do at all with the premise outlined in the back of the book. It was maybe mentioned for about two or three pages at the beginning of the book an alluded towards the end of book as an after-thought. This book really is about two people fighting with each other, making horrible, hateful slurs on each other's reputation, who all the sudden look at each other and decide that they are in love. Please! Don't waste your money on this book. I wish I hadn't."
3,price reflects the quality,"Though the great price on this mp3 player makes it more attainable than an iPod, the external quality of it is poor. Good for running and exercising, the small, compact shape makes it easy to carry around in your pocket or purse. Unfortunately, the cheap outer coating on mine started coming off about a month after I bought it, so that now (at one year old) it looks very cheap and used. The screen does not display the name or artist of the songs, only a number to which it is assigned, which was disappointing as well.The software often crashes, but is easy to use for beginners. Also, the program seems cheaply put together as well.But again, I have had mine for one year and it still works prfectly. If internal quality is your real concern, and you have no preference of how it looks, I'd say this mp3 player is a great deal."
2,"Not the refurbished ones, though","I saved some money and bought a refurbished one. It lasted less than three months and now won't power up. The manufacturer warranty on the refurbs is one month, which tells you how much faith they put in their product. Buyer beware."
4,irock 530 mp3 player,"Good sound holds about 35 songs expandable smart media card,costly!Can not find software to play in Real One Player."
4,"Nice cap, but really small","I ordered this cap for an elementary music program. I realize that part of the novelty of this type of hat is that it is small and looks goofy, but it was too small for the kids to keep on their head. The quality seemed good. It was just really small sized. We made it work by pinning it to a wig for the student to wear, but I wish that it would have been a little bigger."
3,propeller hat,Propeller was broken on arrival. I did not have time to return it or look for another one before Halloween so I didn't do anything about it
3,SMALL,"This ""childs"" hat is more like a toddler hat. It runs very small and did not fit my 7 year old son's average sized head."
2,This book sinks,"This is a book that could only have been written in the 1990's. The so-called 'conspiracy'appears specious at best. (Words of Wisdom: Never ascribe to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity.) All available evidence on TITANIC points to massive incompetence and lack of communication as the true cause of the disaster. I really doubt that the White Star Line wanted to sink one of their prized new liners for the insurance! This, again, is a very modern outlook and the authors offer no proof of their hypothesis. TITANIC CONSPIRACY is also turgidly written and only has one 'fact' that appears to be original with the authors. I won't spoil it for you here. You may have already bought this one. I did, and wish I hadn't. There are much better books on TITANIC out there; this one is strictly for the tabloid set."
4,"Great book, Great series","Francine pascal has been my all time favourite author. I have read all the sweet valley kids,most of the twins,half of the highs,my first senior year,and most of the SVU.According to me sweet valley high is the best, but svh senior year is pretty cool too. If you want an excellent read your looking at the right book. Assured,100 percent your going to love it."
4,I loved it!,"This book is gettin more into the Angel-Tia-Trent love triangle. I feel really bad for Tia on this one. Also if you hated the whole Will and Jessica thang then you'll be happy after this one. I just wish Jessica doesn't get w/ Conner's friend! Plus, Andy really gets a chance in this one. I've been really likin Andy."
4,Not the best,This wasn't one of the better SVHSY books. The book is mostly about Tia and her problem with Trent and Angel. Andy's having problems with a girl. And Jess is getting over Will. Noting about Conner and Liz except from other people's views. And Ken and Maria are hardly mention.
2,Ok Book others were a lot better,"I had my Hopes up for a really great book. It wasn't that great the Love Triangle with Trent, Tia and Angel spiced up a little but not much. Hope the next one's better. I know Francine Pascal can write much better books. Well hope I helped (probably not though) =)"
5,This Bird Soars,"In this age of short-attention-span pop, it's refreshing and inspiring to discover that some songwriters still care about crafting an album that can hold up play after play. Kathleen York's latest release, Bird York, is just such a work, constructed of multiple layers that suggest pigment on a canvas, each color augmenting the next, yet serving its own unique purpose. Her instrumentals and vocals are perfectly matched to her complex lyrics, drawing the listening toward the music, revealing clues one fragment at a time. Songs like ""What Are You Running After"" and ""Bought A Gun"" are as haunting as a vivid dream, staying in the listener's mind and forming their own mythology. And being a master of both rhythmic drive and storytelling, York knows how to engage her listeners' bodies in moving to the grooves at the same time she introduces them to characters they will never forget. All in all, taking flight with Bird York is a trip not to be missed."
2,"Well written, but CD is sadly incomplete.","I found the text to be excellent, however most (or all) of the Silverrun modeling products that were supposed to be on the CD are not. And they are no longer available from the publisher, Silverrun technologies, or the author. You can download later versions of the Silverrun software, but they are crippled demo versions that do not allow you to create some of the larger models built in the exercises. So all you can do on those excercises is read the book, and do the programming. Much of the modelling in the first half of the book is not possible using the silverrun tools explained in the book.I would return the book, but it does have many excellent Delphi examples."
2,Sorry I bought it,"I got this for two reasons: 1)because it connects to the computer; 2)it has RCA jack imputs for my turntable. I was excited until I installed it. The software isn't approved by Microsoft and there are bugs that sporadically interfere with my PC. I am going to remove the software and disconect it. It seems as if there is no amplifier in the system because the sound is very soft when I play a record. I max out the volume and can only hear soft music. Bummer! Unfortunately it is not worth returning, since I would have to pay the shipping.As a bookshelf CD player, I'm sure it is better. The only problem is it is slow to change disks. No big whoop.If you were going to buy if for either of the two reasons I did, I recomend finding another system. If you find a better one, let me know."
1,AMAZON LIES RE SHIPMENT PRICE,"I found this available through ""Deal Scout"" that says its findings are ""in association with AMAZON.COM"". Deal Scout says it will be shipped free if price is greater than $25 but when I attempted to order it a $28 + shipping charge was added. It cost me an extra $10 to purchase it locally but they did not lie to me re the cost."
5,"Great sound, Fits in a bookshelf, Plays music from computer","This is very good sounding for a small room, I have it in the basement, gets the whole family dancing. It plays CDs (CD-R and CD-RW) with MP3s on them as well as normal audio CDs. And hooked up to the computer with USB cable I can listen to the music before burning CDs, also internet radio."
5,Great sounding little powerhouse,"I bought this unit from a local retail store as it caught my eye and was on sale. I have this unit set up in my bedroom, connected to my Roku M1000 Soundbridge to listen to online radio stations.... and the sound is amazing.I listen mainly to high energy rock/dance... with the occasional evening of jazz and downtempo... and all genres sound fantastic on this thing."
1,"Cute, if it works...","I was very happy with my purchase until the CD player stopped working about a week after it arrived. Now I am very annoyed because I am forced to take it to a Philips ""authorized service center"", about an hour from my home. I also saw the same exact stereo advertised at Target for $100, which is $50 less than what I paid. I guess the ""free super-saver shipping"" wasn't so free after all. NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE!"
1,Poor quality - broken after less than 2 months,"CD changer broke after less than 2 months of very light use.The unit is still broken and is sitting (for almost 2 months)in the Philips service center. Aftermany hours spent on the phone with the completelyclueless customer service, it appears that Philipsis refusing to ship the parts to its own authorizedservice center in Chicago (?). I haven't receivedany explanation (let alone an apology) for this.Still waiting for them to honor their warranty.Poor quality - even worse customer service."
5,great LITTLE unit,"Surprised at the small size!(good!) ease of use is great. Personally I think the sound in all ranges and volumes couldn't be improved on. The stupid oval speaker covers went away immediately, as should the ?stylist?"
3,It doesn't have MP3 input,"It looks like have MP3 input in the discription or ad,but it doesn't. So I returned one of two I ordered for my daughters.After I buy this item here, the price was $89.99 at Target.So I was very dissapointed and regret."
2,"Good Design, Short Life","Like many other reviews here... the unit itself was fine (excepting the annoying time for CDs to change) and, I thought, a good value. Unfortunately, after 2 years of very light use (maybe a couple hours a month CDs/radio), ran into the same CD lock-up problem. Can't even use the radio or other inputs, since the changer is noisily trying to recover... Guess I won't be using Philips again..."
4,Makes a great computer setup,"I purchased this unit for a desktop stereo and plugged in my Mac Dual G4. The sound quality is great. I did not use the USB input option because it is PC only, but just plugging into Aux is great. There is little comparison to standard computer speakers, but these are obvioulsly a little bigger.The only negatives I can add about this unit is that it does not allow an external subwoofer. There appears to be a sealed off port for it on the back of the main unit, but there is not an option. Also, I would like to have an extra Aux input. It would be great to plug in a XM unit or my iPod directly into the back, along with my computer.Overall I have to say that this a great system for listening to music in the office."
2,Philips mocro won't play MP3s,"Damned !#!?! Philips micro system begins to read but won't play an MP3 disc anymore. Sweet micro system with great sound, but the one single feature I love is gone :("
4,Pleasantly surprised,"For the price, this little guy puts out decent sound. Rich bass without distortion and loud enough to wake up my teaching neighbors. BONUS: I can hook up my iPod with Monster RCA cable which sounds way better than any docking system at half the price."
2,Could have been summed up in a single chapter,"This book contains some interesting information and some good tips, but boy it needs some editing! There are A LOT of repetitions, and a lot of the stuff it talks about is just common sense. After a very long introduction (the first 2 chapters) it still takes a lot longer before it actually gives you any practical advice. It all could be summed up into- breastfeed. Wear your baby. Keep your baby close at night. Bond. And then maybe give a couple of examples. All in all, I would advise reading this book only if you know absolutely nothing about babies."
4,This book confirms that your parenting instincts are right.,"Every parent has been told ""don't hold the baby too much, you'll spoil her"". This book confirms that the instinct of most parents-- to hold a baby who wants to be held-- isn't going to ""spoil"" or in any other way hurt your child's development. Dr Sears' common-sense approach to parenting is reassuring to new parents (like me) who want to go with their gut feelings and ignore the well-meaning advice of those around them."
2,The Attachment Parenting Book - Nuture your bubba,"This book was not all I hoped it would be, I also ordered the Baby Book by the same author and I find that one to be a better book. There was some good information in this book, but it is more of a second or third book to read on attachment parenting as it is a bit full on."
3,"Good recommendations, but exasperatingly repetitive","I have a ten-month daughter, and do virtually everything recommendedin this book. I agree completely with Dr. Sears' methods, and I'mvery grateful to his wife and him to the effort expended expoundingthese views.However, the book itself is maddeningly repetitive and banal. Howmany times must it repeat nostrums like ""Do what works for you"" or""Trust your instincts""? I expected, at least, some solid discussionabout current research into this area, but the book only had links tothe associated web-sites ...However, on the web-sites, I was pleased to see full references torecent research, and discussion thereof. Skip the book and browse thesites instead. - Rujith."
3,"Great info, but not a necessary purchase if you own other Sears books","I read this book first, before reading The Baby Book, and loved it. However, after I bought The Baby Book, I realized that it contained a lot of the same information & it would've saved me some money just to buy The Baby Book alone, instead of both. I'm assuming that some of the other Sears books may contain the same info, too."
3,"Bland, but good summary of attachment parenting","Ok, I say get the Baby book, written by the same author(s) that gives you 5x more information than this book does.This book is bland, and limited to some, albeit sound information that is a no-brainer for most actively involved parents.Still, if you want a short read, this is definitely a good summary of attachment parenting."
3,A hollow marriage.,"A mother/daughter (21?) insinuate themselves into the household of a 54 year old professor whose wife is away for a year for professional reasons. The plot centers on the professor's growing love for the daughter, culminating in a baby (which may not be his). Jolly deliberately makes the daughter unattractive and passive - for the book is really about a man in a hollow marriage, although he doesn't realize it, with close friends who are well meaning, but not nurturing. The positive characters are the slightly sinister mother, with a genius for creating a warm household, and a spinster friend who is honorable, capable, and a paragon of true friendship. Some of Jolley's prose reads as if it were translated from German, and the plot and the professor are in some ways silly, but at the same time the professor is a very well realized character, and the book is an OK read."
1,"Sub-Standard BluRay, Incomplete set.","The product detail states:Number of discs: 4But this is actually only 1 BluRay Disc with 4 movies.None of the Films in this offering contain Subtitles.The Editorial Review (as of this review) lists the movies in this order:THE PROPHECYTHE PROPHECY: UPRISINGTHE PROPHECY 3: THE ASCENTTHE PROPHECY: FORSAKENThe single bluray lists the movies in this order:THE PROPHECYTHE PROPHECY 3: THE ASCENTTHE PROPHECY: UPRISINGTHE PROPHECY: FORSAKENIt is misleading because the second movie (THE PROPHECY 2) is not in this set and UPRISING is not the second movie.If you like these movies, and I do, do *not* add this item to your collection ( ASIN: B006ZL1PAC ) as you will likely be disappointed."
2,Not what I thought it woulod be,The order arrived in good time before Christmas. The DVD were in good shape. I just did not appreciate the shows. I know not to listen to friends
2,The Prophecy Collection: 4 Film Set (Blu-ray),"The two stars were for a overall combined rating, If they just included the first two editions, I would probably given it 3 stars. They included the last two movies just to re-sell an old movie that was milked to death with sequels. It's only worth purchasing, if you can get it dirt cheap, and like the first two movies."
1,Not Blu-ray quality,1 disc comes with 4 movies crammed on it. None of the movies are blu-ray quality. This is a rip-off. Buy the DVDs instead.
1,Beware: This is NOT on 4 disks!,"The sales page clearly states that these four movies come on four disks, but that's not true. They don't even come on two sides of one disk. All four movies are crammed onto a single side of one disk, making for terrible picture quality. And Prophecy 2 isn't even included! I returned the ""set""."
2,Don't bother,"I picked this up for what I thought was a great price, 9.99, but then come to find out that one of the key movies in the series, part 2, is missing completely from the set.As some have mentioned here also, the quality is subpar, but to me it would still have been worth it just to have the entire collection on one disc.Disappointing."
3,NOT a boxed set.,"These are great movies, but unfortunately this is not a boxed set. It is 3 individual DVD movies in separate standard cases. Don't expect any nifty cardboard box or anything extra at all. You get exactly what you would get if you purchased all three movies separately. Except you pay more for a so-called boxed set!"
1,Retractable but not portable,"People looking for portability, like me - this unit is not small. At all. Also, the picture does not show enough detail - the end that plugs into the power brick is a 3-prong ""Y""-type (the one that normally can be found on desktops). Most laptops, however have power ""bricks"" with an 8-shaped plug - so this cable will not fit."
1,Unusable,I bought this cable to be used as an extension to the power supply of my MacAir laptop. But the cable could not be plugged into the laptop cord. Completely useless! I'm not sure what you could use it for. I sent it back for a refund
2,"VERBOSE, and there are much better books available.","The BEST book on Opening leads is ""Opening Leads"" by Mike Lawrence. Its the most thorough and deepest of the books on the subject (that Ive read). The next best is ""Opening Leads"" by Robert Ewen. Its a faster read, and should be read before the Mike Lawrence book. I alos like the ""Improve your Opening Leads"" by Hugh Kelsey (read it after the Ewen book).This book (by Blackwood)is verbose, and doesnt cover the subject well. While it gives a number of actual hands, it spends a lot of time on other topics. Anything it covers is also coverered in the 3 books above, and they do a far better job. The 3 books above have quizzes, while this book just gives isolated examples."
4,Excellent reference book,"MacOsko has written an excellent *reference* book; don't pick this up as your first foray into the field of rheology. (I recommend Stephen Rosen's text for that job.) MacOsko provides a relatively pain-free introduction to tensors and then proceeds to apply tensor analysis to a variety of rheological topics. If your work doesn't require rigorous tensor analysis, or if you're new to the field, avoid the book. Otherwise it's a very comprehensive and readable reference."
3,A good companion piece to the movie,"This book was just as I expected it to be a behind the scenes look at a very intense movie. The photos are spectacular and the narrative very informative. My only complain is there is not enough of either. It left me wanting more. Maybe that is what a good book is supposed to do but I still had unanswered question concerning how the movie was made. I love those production stories full of little details of how they did it, what went wrong and how they made it all work somehow. Was it worth the price, yes but I would have paid more to get more."
3,great souvenir coffee table item,"Although I give this movie 5 stars, the book only gets 3 stars. The book gives an insight into some of the behind the scenes themes to the movie (the airfield where they made the village, the Irish army, and boot camp), and into some of themes of the movie. As for the movie: there are some military imperfections, but overall a great movie which I want to watch over and over again! Another fault with the movie is that its built upon a ""Macdonalds"" formula that tries to hit all the right buttons. Overall, this does not bother me, since its message is that war is without glory , its just about soldiers who want to know why they're fighting, and how they can get home as soon as possible."
2,Not very easy to use,"If you can actually get the picture to turn out right, it does take pretty decent pictures. Most of the time the photo is either over-exposed or too dark and grainy. It also only holds about 5 pictures, so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot. I was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost 40 dollars, and it doesn't really seem worth it."
1,Stay in school,After reading the first review I can only say one thing..... Kid's please stay in school.
3,Digital Camera,"This is a great 1st digital camera. It is easy to use and takes decent pictures. However, the display on it is really small and it drains the batteries quick, even while its off. If you purchase this camera, I recomend using rechargable batteries. Still, its not bad for the price."
2,Argus camera,"I bought two of these for my kids because they were so cheap. I didn't expect them to be great, but my kids won't even use them. They don't function easily, the pictures are fuzzy and they don't hold many pictures."
2,Spend the extra money on something better,Purchased as a birthday gift and out of the box the Card slot did not work. Internal memory is not enough to take more then a few of its highest quaility pictures.My 1mp Camera phone takes better pics then this phone does and the pinky sized screen is useless.I would just say don't waste your money and spend an extra $40 for a brand name unit that is worth the money.This unit even if it does work out of the box I have doubts that it will last very long. Seems really cheaply made.I bought another camera as a replacement at Wallmart for $80 a Sanyo and it was 5mp and was well worth the money.You get what you pay for.Hope this helps.
1,the quality was too poor even for my 4-year old,"we bought this piece of junk for our 4year old so she would not constantly ask to play with our own camera. the images on the camera were of such poor quality, i question whether i was wearing someone else's glasses. also, the batteries ran out after minimal use. if there are realtively good digital cameras on the market for 100$ with 3megapizels, then there is no reasong why an off-brand company cannot produce a reasonable child-qulaity 2MP camera for 40$. we plan on retruning this item."
1,Piece of ++++ !,"This camera is not worth $10.00 it is terrible in every aspect. However, it is still not as bad as the company that is selling it. I opened the shrink plastic very neatly and tried to return this item, the company would not let me because I had opened the package, to see the quility of the product before giving it to my grandson for Christmas. There response was to tell me to sell it on Amazon !! I have always trusted amazon, but I cannot figure out how they can have a company like this as one of there marketplace members!!!!!Argus QC-2185 Quick Click 2MP Digital Camera"
2,this camra sucks,this camra is sucks so horably.the screen to veiw your pictures is soo small its not even worth being there u cant even see the picture u just took! nto to mention it sucks the life out of battaries SUPER FAST! and it takes the by far the WORST indor pictures ive ever seen.dont purchase this item its like flushing money down the toilet do your resurch and purchase a better item.
2,LCD display highly disappointing,"We bought this camera intending to give it to our 8-year-old son for his birthday. He loves taking pictures with the family's (expensive) digital camera, and I thought it would be good to get him a cheaper camera that we wouldn't be heartbroken about if it got lost or broken.But when the Argus arrived and I tried it out prior to wrapping it for his birthday, I was so disappointed with it that I decided not to give it to my son after all. The problem is that the picture quality of the LCD display is horrible, no matter what lighting conditions you are in. I am sure that the actual picture quality of the photos themselves is better after you load it onto a computer or print them out. However, because this camera was meant for a child who mostly just likes pointing and clicking and looking at the photo on the camera display right then and there, the LCD display quality was unacceptable."
3,Cheap easy to use camera.,"This last Christmas I bought three of these cameras and some scrapbooking materials for my grandchildren, ages 6, 7 and 9. They were delighted. You can take a decent picture with this camera. Color is slightly off, and you have to be very still to get an unblurry picture, but the kids learning curve was rapid and by the end of the day they were taking pretty darn good pictures. Which I would print out for them for their scrapbooks. All and all a good buy for what it was intended."
4,fun little camera,Our 8 year old bought this camera with her saved up money. She absolutely loves it! It is great for anyone that doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a digital camera. The pictures come out pretty good. We're very happy with it.
2,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this pointless, stupid book. It's just the tale of the two main bad guys committing ever more terrible and horrible murders, technology that ignores the laws of physics and doesn't sound good doing it, and strange godlike beings who do absolutely nothing for the plot"
4,Copyright date.,"The book was first published in 1940, and the printer here is stealing the copyright from the rightful heirs. The 1940 original was printed on heavy slick paper, with about 70 black and white photo plates, and is a very thorough book."
4,Excellent background music...,"As a fan of brass ensembles at Christmas, I'm familiar with the Philadelphia, Canadian, London, Prince of Wales, and Solid brass ensembles. All are worthwhile, with the proviso that the Canadian Brass decline with each successive recording (the first being their best). Most of these groups play bright and often snappy arrangements, often building to climaxes at the end.The Gramercy Brass take a somewhat different approach, a little less extroverted and more mellow and smooth than the others. Arrangements are subtle, not flashy. Their playing, however, is by no means dull; these are fine musicians.So if you're looking more for a warm glow than visceral excitement, this ensemble creates a fine Christmas atmosphere."
3,Overwhelming,"If you're looking for a book to guide you through the thicket of self-publishing in ebook and print on demand formats, this book isn't it. It's full of facts but not very much nitty gritty know-how from those who have gone through the process, learned from their mistakes and now are sharing their wisdom with others."
5,CD Single of Choice EXCELLENT,"I have always liked Fatboy Slim, and this CD Single(enhanced) shows why. BE CAREFUL..ENSURE ITS THE CD SINGLE, ENHANCED THAT CONTAINS THE ""WEAPONS OF CHOICE"" VIDEO! Others do not.This CD does contain expicit lyrics, to watch out for that. ""Star 69"" is a great cut, but my favorite is 'Weapons Of Choice"". The video is landmark, and is worth the total cost alone. While not ""super dance"" I love to play it in the car and on the boat as part of a mix with ""The Gorillaz"", ""Moloko"", ""Paul Oakenfeld"", and other similar artists. Highly recommended."
5,Good Stuff,"This bar tastes pretty good , but more importantly blends some caffeine with an acceptable tasting bar. Excellent for marathons or other long runs."
5,Clif Rules,Everyone has a favorite. Peanut toffee buzz is mine. I incorporate these as Weight Watchers treats as well as energy food while hiking. Highly recommended.
1,Political propaganda from the left,"If you want to become a part of the alternate reality that is the left side of the political spectrum of America and the world, check this silly book out. You will probably not learn anything new as all of the facts are suspect. For example, the author states that there is ""no evidence"" of WMD in Iraq. How about the Kurds who were gassed by their own president? Maybe the author should have a conversation with them about it. I'm putting my copy into the circular file. Yuck."
1,Double Yuck,"I agree with the last review. This is nothing but propaganda, perpetuated by someone who has a feeble grasp on reality."
3,much better than volume 1!,"gosh, somebody up at future lounge must have been paying attention to sales of the first album b/c this is a great improvement. that last one wasn't lounge - especially of the future! Vol 2 transcends this genre with some very nice notable tracks, they include:organic mondaycascabelmetti una sera...funky constructtell the girls...It's abstract, it's vocal, it's trendy, it's lounge, and most of all, it's worth a buy."
2,Breathtaking Blue,"Being absolutely taken with Alphaville's hit song ""Forever Young,"" I wanted to check out more. Unfortunately, I have found none of their songs to equal this hit, and in fact, the rest is pretty bad."
5,Something different!,"Well, first; this is an album totally different from Forever Young, Afternoons in Utopia or Prostitute.But this album also has some incredible songs so enjoyable!!!!Maybe Not the Alphaville you expect, but some good music you will love!"
1,Misleading,"The title ""The Tale of South Pacific"" led me to believe this would be a study of the origins of the great R&H show, but it is a kind of glorified scrapbook of the making of the 1958 movie of the show. There is a growing literature about Broadway musicals that is several cuts above this book (for example, Tim Carter's book on ""Oklahoma""), and I was disappointed in the Skouras. The text is anecdotal, and it is full of not very well reproduced photographs from the filming of the movie. This is probably a fine book if you'd like a deluxe movie program booklet with pictures of the stars, but not very helpful if you'd like a well-researched, carefully documented study of this fine show."
1,Get away before is too late,"What a terrible movie!!!! I wanted to watch this movie because I am a fan of ""Tieta's Soap Opera"". What a mistake! The story is not the same, the actors are not good, the whole situation is wrong. I had to watch this piece of .... fast forwarding. What a waste of time and money."
4,Good Movie,"This is a very entertaining movie - but let me say what it is basically about since no-one has. Sonia Braga plays the role of a very assertive and ""successful"" woman who returns to the place of her up-bringing after her husband dies. It had been years since she was cast away. Where she grew up, the countryside of Brasil, is very much like the way she left it only people are a bit older - yet the core remains the same. From the moment she arrives, she turns the small village upside down and creates a slew of mischeif here and there with her family and old friends.Enjoyable and surprising (in a way) ending and Sonia Braga displayed the true fire of the Brasileira."
2,Not the best,"I bought this for my students and I'm sorry to say this but this is pretty boring. The audio is pretty bad and combined with a british accent makes it sometimes hard to make out what the guy is saying. Seems like a nice enough guy, but I've seen much better. I don't deny this guy is talented but the quality could be better."
2,Save your money,"I had purchased this video for my wood turning club. I had found the contents to be the same old, same old. The projects and technics are just enough to tease the beginner and bore the experienced turner."
5,Absolutely neccesary,"Right adapter for the WC-E68 lens for my Nikon Coolpix 4500 digital camera, fair price, good delivery."
4,PRETTY DARN GOOD,"Recently saw the Philly Pops Holiday Concert in Philidelphia. Great concert, great music, great performance. Haven't listened to album yet, but since it is the same music, it must be good. Unbelievable songs, nicely done."
3,convenient cd holder,decent product and very useful for storage in my car; a bit on the pricey side however.
2,Velcro straps not spaced wide enough,"This visor does not fit well on my two vehicles. The spacing on the velcro loops needs to be about 1/2"" wider to both not obstruct the mirror, or get caught in the little bar that holds the car's visor and allows it to rotate up and down."
4,It ain't bad,"This is a neat CD holder, as it's got its straps for its Sun Visor location, as you should put all your drive-like stuff here, and then it'll be a good reference. Not shabby. Really."
5,Kev,One of the scariest movies of all time. The special effects were great and the acting was amazing. Hope to see more from this crew.
3,Gore & Plot...Verry Kewl !,"So,The government trained this guy and then let him go...As a civilian ?Incredible tortures,deaths and clues up the wazoo.Whoever this actor (Steve Furedy) is,He definitely does killer well...Looks kind of like Willie Nelson and Jerry Garcia -ish.The detectives are the case bring new meaning to Good Cop & Bad Cop.Grisly special effects that make you wince and yet,Cannot wait to see what the Bad Guy will do next.All principals have many credits and it shows all true professionals and beleive in their craft.Ending made one long for ""Good Guys Wear Black"" with Chuck Norris in his debut performance."
1,Chicken Soup for the Mother's Soul,"This book was advertised as NEW but when it arrived, it had several pages missing and numerous paragraphs clipped out of other pages. NOT GOOD."
5,Touching,"I recently purchased this book and have only a few more pages to read...all the stories are very touching/only a mother can relate, I believe. The one story which really sticks in my mind is the one about ""My trip to Holland""...for anyone who has been blessed with a healthy child should read this story/it will make you look at your child and be thankful and it should help you look inside yourself and realize that patience for a normal child does not compare to the patience needed for a child with a disability.I think of that everytime I become upset or inpatient with my child/I realize how lucky we all are."
4,Overall an Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed this book - I found the characters intriguing and the story had just enough twists to make it interesting without making it unbelievable. I was somewhat bothered about the amount of personal history that was shared about other people in the story - I have to believe they did not know this information was going to be given to the world. I'm sure ""Adrienne"" in particular was quite bothered, to say the least, at the information given in this book - especially since a couple of minutes on Google reveals who she really is."
2,Not what it appears to be,"This tale is so manipulated that it is annoying. I could tell by the tortured language that the author had some hook; when he reveals it in chapter 2 a rereading of chapter 1 reveals actual dishonesty. By the end of the book, I disliked the author.The memoir itself is interesting; the way he chose to present it is just wrong. He wrote this book at the expense of the other people involved."
4,magic in a cynical world,"There's something delicate and yet powerful about this author's writing, something that raises him above the mainstream... something like Piers Athony. You find yourself willingly subscribing to this fantastic fictional world where unicorns may just lurk in the woods, and ordinary mere mortals can look Evil in its glaring red eye. I can't recommend Estey's books highly enough!"
2,"Love the size, weight, performance, but at 109.6 degrees, it is damn hot!","I just bought my S460 last week. I thought it got rather warm, but never realized how hot it got until today. I was wearing shorts with my computer resting on my thighs. After a few minutes, it was very uncomfortable. When I moved my computer, I noticed that where bare skin had been touching the computer, it was bright red. I decided to take my computer's temp. Using am infrared thermometer, the lower right side of the S460 was 109.6 degrees. That's hot.I have yet to decide if I can live with this."
5,Perfect Selection,"I got this notebook July 2005. I love it and anyone who sees it with me adores its sleekness, compactness and xbright screen. I had my worries when I bought it regarding the heating issue, Sony told me this is a notebook and not a laptop. Anyways, I have been a VAIO User ever since I started using laptops, so I was kind of used to the heating thing. It is quick, light, very easy to use..The drawback that I see is the lack of enough ports. No infra red, no bluetooth, no Video outlet, only two USB ports, kind if frustrating, till you get used to it..But.. you can't ask for everything. Tell you what????It is a VAIO. You can't compare anything with it."
1,Notebook runs to hot!,"I just got the S460 a few days ago, and it get very HOT on the bottom of the notebook only on the right side. Whenever I type I can feel the underside of my hand warming up. I looked at a S350 and it did not have this problem. It really is quite annoying. It's going to cost me $270.00 to return this little oven. Do not buy this model."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,Since purchasing this laptop I have always experienced the following problems:1. Extremely hot base!2. Constant and loud fan noise!3. Low Battery life--much less than stated even at max battery schemes!I'm not sure if my memory is the 2x256This is a faulty product. Someone should probably start a class action suit considering all the other complaints.
4,S460 the perfect compromise,"I've put thousands of hours on my S460 in the last two years - all of them without the slightest of problem. Processor speed is outstanding for all but the most intense calculation environments, and the nVidia GO6200 graphics are more than capable of great 3D action. The fan/heat output on the right side is present, but has never presented the slightest of problems...I really can't imagine what some are complaining about...that heat needs to go somewhere - outside of the case - it's not like the Pentium M or other components are elctronically inefficent relatively speaking."
1,No Support,I own The earlier version of this product. VGN360-P/C and the customer support has been horrible. from the first tier tech's that know absolutely nothing to the supervisors that just plain don't care.THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.I will never buy another Sony product again.
3,disappointed,"I just got the S460 a few days ago, and was really suprised at how HOT it gets on the bottom of the notebook only on the right side. Whenever I type I can feel the underside of my hand warming up. It really is quite annoying. It makes me not want to use the notebook as much! I've been using a PCG-FX340 sony vaio that I got in 2001, and am really missing how it doesn't actually burn my hand as I use it.The fan is noticeable. I'm still debating whether or not I should return this notebook!"
3,The fan is not that terrible...,"There have been complaints about the fan noise. On my unit when the fan is going full blast, it sounds about the same as a CD Drive on a Desktop computer. Not terrible but I can see how it may be annoying to some people.The other bad thing about this unit is that it will only accept Sony brand batteries, so if you want a high power battery expect to pay $250-350 instead of about $100.00 for an OEM.What sold me was the high quality LCD display, the best and sharpest one I have seen, even though it does not compare with my desktop CRT.Other than the battery issue, I would give this unit 5 stars.Jim Christensenwww.uwphoto.net"
1,Horrible!,This album features one of the worst performers around. Poor voice singing poorly written songs. Get another album. ANY other album.
5,America its time to listen..,"Now I never heard of Tina Arena until only a few weeks ago when I bought the Zorro DVD. Singing since she was 7 she's a music veteran. Anyone who thinks she sticks is smelling their own poo.So far I only own 3 CD's the first one is Tiny Tina when she was a child, In Deep and Just me. I really like her new look on Just me. Just say she looked happy and alive.But hang on to you hats she has a new CD being released December 5th 2005. But its in French. Un Autra Univers~ Aimer Jusqu'a I'impossible. Though its in French you should still get it. If you wait and order it you may get it in January unless you already ordered it. Better hurry!! I've heard some clips from her new CD and her voice sounds more mature and seems to be leaning toward Adult Contempory.I have now four CD's and more on the way. To me their worth every penny I spend."
5,One of the favorite CDs of my life,"This is without a doubt one of my most treasured CDs. Tina Arena's voice is simply amazing. Unlike most other music these days, every song on this album is a great song. The songs that really rise above the rest, in my opinion, are ""Burn"", and ""Unsung Hero"". Every time I hear them, they touch me in a very personal way.I can't wait until another of Tina's outstanding works of art is released."
4,"Four stars only because ""Don't Ask"" gets 5!","I agree, ""Burn"" is really wonderful. BUT, the treasure of the CD is ""Welcome To My World""! A feel-good song that makes you forget about the troubles of life. TINA IS A TREASURE! When will the world (or the US) discover how awesome she is?"
1,This album sucks!,Spare your ears the totrture of listening to non-singing. She's got one of the worst voices in the industry! NO wonder she's still a starlet.
3,"Not as good as ""Don't Ask""","I was sad to buy this CD and find some of the songs that are on the import CD are missing on the American version of the disc. I think Tina has great vocals and I love her remake of ""I Want to Know What Love Is,"" but there is no hidden acoustic track of ""Burn"" and no slow sad songs like ""Wasn't it Good?"" Overall I give the CD three stars because I know the songs will grow on me, but an inital listening of the CD didn't impress me as much as I anticipated. ""Burn"" is a really good song, and I am always in amazement at Tina's vocal ability. She is a true talent."
5,Wunk rock,"Just so you all know, this album kicks heiney and you need to buy it today, but please do go to www.sojh.com and support the artist while saving about two dollars PLUS postage."
2,Great CD. There are thousands just like it.,"Unoriginal, derivative, telegraphed ""wunk rock"" which is a rip-off of NOFX/Less than Jake rip-offs. I would support local Nebraska music if it had something fresh and exciting to offer, not like this. Imagine the happy comedic energy of NOFX, but without the originality or creativity, the musical punk-rock equivalent of every Chevy Chase movie after ""Vacation"" and ""Caddyshack."" Boring, tedious and un-recommended.For those of you under the age of 16, disregard the above. Here is a review for you: THIS CD ROX DOOD!!!! U SHOOD BUY IT IF U R INTO PUNK ROCK THEEZ GUYZ ROOLE!!!I gave this two stars, just because they're not pretending to be white suburban gang-bangers with backwards hats."
3,Good Intro to OT,This is a good intro to the Old Testament.I have seen more complicated books but I'm glad I started with this one.
3,Lacking in a couple of key areas,"No question - GOTHAM is comprehensive. But saying it's the ""best book yet written about NYC"" is NOT the same as saying it's anything close to the best book that could be written.The main disappointments for me maps.While the descriptions of the city are detailed for every era, the lack of ""lyricism"" cited by an earlier reviewer at this web site leaves the reader without a mind's eye image of what the city must have BEEN like, and looked like.Pet peeve - did anyone else notice how many times the authors used the phrase "" - odd"" to denote an inexact quantity? I know it sounds trivial, but it drove me nuts, it was so frequent. E.g., ""twenty-odd years later,"" ""fifty-odd administrators,"" ""two hundred odd voters,"" ""thirty odd Whigs,"" and on and on. I counted 50 instances of this locution in the first 400 pages. Or is it 50-odd?Anyway, it's an outstanding reference work, but not a great piece of writing"
5,SPECTACULAR!,"Tremendous detail and fantastic history make this book top notch. Incredibly well researched without a ""revionist"" slant make this book a must read. By far this is my favorite of all American History books I have read. Having grown up in Brooklyn (and bored my buddies to death leading them to historical landmarks) only enhanced the experience. Few books ""bring you there"" but Gotham has that magic of taking you on a time travel to the glorious and not so glorious days of a great city."
3,I thought the Pulitzer was for good writing....,"Detailed? Yes. Accurate? Probably. Well written? Um, not really. This book has a lot to recommend it in the way of byzantine detail. The flow is, however, sorely impaired by the fact that at least one of the authors refuses to adopt a perspective. I say ""one of the authors"" because this book is very unevenly written: one section will be great while the section immediately following will be mediocre at best or repetitious and confusing at worst. This book has two authors and that is unfortunately apparent in the text.These two guys should have done themselves a favor and either hired a ghost-writer to author a single, unified book or made their editor do his job. But simply taking the pages of two different works and randomly coalating them into a single book is not the best way to write a history.Now, the only question remaining is: who was on the pulitzer committee?"
4,"Well written, fascinating and comprehensive but. . .","The type is so small that if your vision isn't perfect you have to hold it a bit close. The book is so heavy that doing that is like a workout. It is so well written, so interesting and has so many details that I have never seen anywhere else that I am really trying to get through it all, but it is physically taxing! Why not publish in the victorian manner: three volumes or serialise in a magazine. But for its physical limitations, it would be five stars plus. Betsey Brister"
5,So much to think about,"I took a gamble on this because it was on Kindle's Daily Deal for $1.99, and it's the best $1.99 I've ever spent. It's amazing how the socio-political debates of the late 17th and early 18th centuries were so similar to today's."
5,CONCISE & USEFUL,"Compact & concisely informative, this is one of my best purchases. The book lives in the car for ready reference & gets so much use, the cover edges are wearing down"
4,your little trusted friend,"During my practice whenever I needed to consult it, it gave me information about the symptoms and diseases. The contents are so tightly packed to reduce its volume that one feels it might not be having the required details but it does. Sometime one feels short of some diagrams or illustrations but even then it is very good."
4,Nice addition,"These side guards are nice for the money. The install was fairly easy and done with no help. We like how they look and should do the job protecting from scrapes, scuffs and dings to the doors and rockers. Would recommend these for all around use and light to moderate offroading."
2,Photo misleading,I returned this product simply because I assumed it contained the protection of the physical body as well but it was just the bottom part. It was sturdy but wasn't what I assumed it was.
5,Great product for protection!,"This is a great ""rock rail"" to protect the bottom side edge of your Jeep. It's very easy to install....utilizes the body to frame bolts. It helps to have someone assist you (they are heavy), but I did it by myself in less than 30 minutes. I like the way it looks also!"
4,Good contemporary Christian music with a peace theme,"I really enjoy this CD - originally found it on I-tunes when I was looking for one specific song, and listened to some of the rest, and liked it so much I downloaded the rest of the music. I have since bought it for a gift for a friend. Wonderful music - I listen to often."
2,not very useful,"Great idea, but to find your particular food is next to impossible. You have to settle for finding something that you think is close to the brand and ingredients of the food you eat. It is easy to lose interest very quickly."
3,CarbTrac...Not for me,"I'm a long time low carber, but I count calories as well. This item doesn't track calories, but the low carb foods I eat I either couldn't find, or took too much time to find, causing me to send this back. I traded it for the CalTrac, which is way easier to use and much more motivating as it tracks daily expenditure of calories. Although it doesn't track carbs, I've been counting carbs for so long that I can pretty much count them on my own and know what I can and can't have, so this was not a beneficial purchase for me, anyway."
2,Decent performance; Bad engineering,"The choral performance is a little more polished than that of the 1989 performance of The Choir of St. Gayane on New Albion Records (NA033). But the New Albion recording is a private recording, while this CD was (apparently) recorded during a public performance. So the music shares the CD with various audience noises among which is a bird that was determined to have its 15 minutes of fame. The sound on this CD is among the worst that I have ever heard -- all highs, no lows, like a bargain basement set of microphones was used. If this performance had been done with good engineering in a good, private setting, it probably would have been something worth getting. The choir does a reasonably good job; but unless you can tune out the many distractions and the bad engineering on this CD, I would recommend you pass on this one and get the one by the St. Gayane bunch."
4,Simple and nice product!,The quality on this product is nice. And as long as you use high quality paper towels it helps you remove the sheet easy without touching the rest of the roll. The reason I rated 4 stars is since if you use cheap paper towels the ball on the end will into the paper towel.
3,Meh. It works.,"This paper towel holder holds paper towels, however, the bar with the ball on the end (presumably to assist in tearing the towel away from the roll) is practically useless. I should have seen it ahead of time, or thought about it, but the fact that it's a ball means that the paper towel just slides over it and more often than not just ends up tearing wherever it's weakest instead of on the preferation. If you prefer your paper towel holder to assist in one-handed tearing, then this is not the model for you.Other than that, the construction is quality and ye--it holds paper towels :) It looks nice in the kitchen."
2,Very flimsey,"If you are looking for a Paper Towel Holder that has a sturdy base, look past this one. It is so lightweight that when you pull the papertowels, it slides around on the counter. Would send it back, but would cost more in shipping than I would recoup. Design was nice, it just needs a weighted base."
2,Not stable,"Holds the paper towel, but doesn't stay in place. Easy to knock over. It needs a fourth foot and some weight."
1,Disappointed,The item received was not as pictured. Completetly diffrent item. Wasnt worth my time to return or dispute. But will never buy used item through amazon again. Better results with Ebay. Seller should be honest with product information and disclose that picture being used is not actual item.
4,"Encouraging, Relevant...a must have for all single woman!","It doesn't matter if you are 16 and just starting out or 60 and starting over...this book not only will give you purpose and direction to dating, it will help you find the joys of being single! Divorced myself, I have learned some of what Victorya has to say the hard way, but you don't have to. This book has been perfect for me in my journey to finding God's best for me, and I am sure anyone who reads it will agree."
5,I beg to differ...,"I totally disagree with the last reviewer. In the words of my good friend Lisa, ""she must be ugly"". I would think that any book that tells women, `it doesn't matter what you look like, smell like, or act like as long as you love the Lord' is setting a bunch of desperate ugos up for disappointment. Clearly if you were looking at the book, your way DOESN'T WORK. Maybe you should try the way that includes hair, make-up, and bathing. I'm just saying. The book was great, and thanks to Victorya's advice I'm getting married to the man of my dreams in two weeks. This book does help you by telling you what you need to hear (the truth). I'd recommend that any woman that is single run out and buy it immediately!"
5,Heidi,Very intresting for people trying to find out about a language and its heritage. I'm german and love to just check out certain words.
1,Such a waste of time.,This book was horrible!! Absolutely horrible. I wish I would've spent time reading some else!!
1,Book never received after 1 month from order date!!,"I ordered this book on 5/9/2010 through Amazon.com from the vendor 'Thirsty_Mind_Bookshop.' The book was supposed to arrive at my home no later than June 1. I don't know why it would take that long for this book to reach me! It was a selection for my book club meeting the first week of June, which has aleady met.I HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THIS BOOK!!I will not be ordering from this vendor again.How can I get a refund for this order??"
5,Does Openness Equal Freedom?,"The Bush administration has shown its willingness to overlook civil liberties in order to prevent terrorism.This may be noble. But is it dangerous to the stability of our Constitution?The problem, as James Risen frames it, should at least be considered. Learn about ""the Program,"" a Bush Administration tactic used to systematically bypass all of the checks and balances put in place to protect the integrity of our republic. These fundamental protections include the due process of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the U.S. Constitution.According to Risen, this administration is doing an end-run around the very structures that ensure the continuance of our democracy.This is a thoughtful contribution to the public dialogue."
4,What Truly Happened Behind the Scenes,"State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration, written by James Risen, describes in details the mistakes that were made in a time of crisis. Not much is known though on how liable the sources James Risen uses are, since they were kept confidential for various reasons. Most of the blame is placed upon the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and CIA Director George Tenet; however, some blame is also placed on President George Bush. Personally I believe that this shouldn't be and even after reading James Risen's book I still believe that. Yes it outlines crucial mistakes that were made, but with the knowledge the president had at the time of his decision, those choices were the most suitable."
3,State of War,This is a fair book on the lies and corruption of the Bush Administration - but most of the information is available elsewhere. A better book would be any written by Kevin Phillips - especially American Dynasty.
5,Good by definition,Just about to by this book. So the five stars come from a short review of the reviews. Easy to tell that this is an important contribution to what the world is waiting for; more facts and less big mouth rhetoric. So the narrow minded are obviously provoked. That's a good sign.
5,Timely and Important,"Risen has given us a good study of the relationship between CIA and the Bush inner circle, how intelligence was manipulated, and how the personalities involved pursued their own agendas with disastrous consequences. Very telling is the profile of Director Tenet, a politico eager to stay on the job, and who seemed to put his need to be liked ahead of providing accurate intelligence and running an agency that is indispensable in advising presidents. It seems that Cheney and Rumsfeld dominated Tenet, and manipulated him to help them justify their preestablished desire to invade Iraq.All in all a sad tale."
4,Excellent Book...Foreigners Even Steal it to get a copy!,This book was so good that my fiance even stole it from my library and took it back to Germany with him!
1,State of War,"This book is great but the CD version is torture to listen to. The narrator sounds like the synthesizer Stephen Hawking uses to speak. Boyd Gaines narration voice is atrocious - makes one understand what is meant by ""torture"". Worst narrator imaginable!"
2,Disinformation at its Best !,"Dont waste more than a couple of dollars on this breezy lite read. The real problem I had with this book is that it revolves around and gives creedence to the ""Offical Version"" or the propaganda we get on the idiot box. Too Verbose and Not Enough Hard Hitting Content. Example : What happened, why didnt the CIA catch 9/11 ? We just dropped the ball !!! HAHAHHAHA what bs. This book is full of diversionary crap like this. Really folks, there are tons of books that give more information than this, I suggest you start withHouse of Bush House of Saud and Petrodollar Recycling."
2,Important bits of info missing from this book,"Like some books written slightly about Saddam Hussein this book is too easy on the Iraqi dictator/mass murderer. Saddam's conquest of Kuwait does get some mention, plus the fact that much of the world wanting him to pull out of Kuwait not solely the USA desiring him to do so. But Saddam's ultra-deadly mass murder of Iraqi Kurds (182,000 dead kurds in one year alone) is not illustrated by this author well enough. Nor enough of Saddam's other enormous crimes against humanity are well illustrated here either. Plus there is no mention at all of Khadafi of Libya giving up his nuclear bomb project once he saw the USA and it's allies take Saddam down in 2003 and Khadaffi feared he (Khadafi) might be next to be taken out."
1,An Example Of What Is Wrong With Journalism Today,"This book only came out today. How can I review it so quickly? Because it is so thin and shoddy. It is full of instances where the author cites single (unnamed) individuals as his sources for supposedly important stuff. In some cases he acknowledges that what his single source told him may be wrong --but ""if it is true"" it would be important. You can tell who is sources are too...they are the folks who are described elsewhere in the book as ""genial"" or smart. Clearly many of his sources are people with axes to grind. The author plows lots of old ground ...and when he gets to new stuff...it is often the type of information which, IF TRUE, would help America's enemies. Let's pray that our nation's foes ignore this book -- as most of America will. Dust off the Judy Miller suite at the Alexandria Jail and reserve a lumpy mattress for Mr. Risen."
5,State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush...,"Excellent Quality, Timely Receipt, Excellent Price. Will definitely use again and recommend to associates.Dr. John N. Parrigin, CPP, CFE"
2,Only for scholars,"The Buddhist World of Southeast Asia is written for those people with an extensive background of knowledge in the Buddhist religion. Swearer uses complex language which is hard to follow and understand if you don't have a grasp on the Buddhist terminology. But, Swearer does give a descriptive view of the ""typical"" Buddhist monk and layman traditions, customs, and practices. He covers subjects ranging from festivals and cermonies to the kings and cosmology. I would only recommend this book to someone with a sincere interest in the details of life in Southeast Asia."
4,Enjoyable for the most part...,"I enjoyed reading this book, but as another reviewer said, I found the author's comments about not being able to afford this or that absolutely ridiculous. Her lifestyle is obviously upper middle class. While I don't want to belittle how difficult it must be to start over after losing a spouse, her integration into French society was much easier than it would be for the average expat, since she obviously had a comfortable amount of money with which to do it.All in all, the story was fun to read and had some good humor. It's a quick read and entertaining. And there are some interesting insights into French culture in this book. I recommend it overall, but like I said already, I did find myself annoyed at her repeated comments about her budget, since she obviously lives a life of privilege. Most expats would not find integration into French life quite so easy from a financial perspective.I liked Sarah Turnbull's ""Almost French"" better than this book."
2,C'est disappointing!,"I'll admit I'm a sucker for the living abroad in Europe books. This book was disappointing, however, as several other reviewers have noted. Portions ring true (as a woman widowed at age 40, I completely related to the grief she feels and the need to start anew), but significant portions of the book strike me as shallow. The author strikes me as disingenuous at times. She is shocked (shocked!) that her American friend professes outrage when the author tells him she's having an affair with a married man. Hey, I'm not a prude, but adultery is adultery--even in Paris! She also expresses shock when the chic Parisian shop doesn't carry her (large) dress size. She's shocked (shocked!) to learn that Americans are often fat and French women tend to be thin or average in terms of weight. Despite this, however, I did read in the entire book in an evening. If you want something light and not terribly insightful, this may be the book for you."
2,Disappointing,"Flat writing makes this book dull, much like a brochure you might get from your brokerage. Too simplistically written to be anything more than a primer for absolute beginners, and even there I think you can do better elsewhere. Later chapters are somewhat useful in explaining the business cycle, but one senses that this book doesn't fulfill its goal."
1,G-STAMP GOLF BALL MONOGRAMMER,"I couldn't get it to work, and I belong to Mensa. Couldn't even get it back together. Why would Golf USA/Amazon/Goilf Projects International sell this junk?"
3,"Fantastic Rahsaan, poor sound...","Ok. This would be one of my favorite Kirk live performances, but, After the first track, the sound quality descends into what can only be compared to a 'wire recording'or bootleg, which really got my back up. To be honest, I still listen, as I love this cats playing so much. Rolling 'boogie woogie' cover of 'Love for sale,' and at one point it sounds like he's tryin' to eat his horn! Fusspots will balk at this but enthusiasts will relish this gig from 72."
3,Interesting but wordy and very male centered perspective,"An interesting look at the politics that influence policing both current and historical. However, this is written from a very male point of view so don't expect much in the way of a gendered analysis of policing or focus on female officers. Some interesting content nonetheless, but be aware of it's limitations."
1,Not worth the money,"This pocket eye chart isn't worth the money. The printing is smudged and flaking off, even though it's suppose to be new. The 20/30, 20/20, and 20/15 lines are so poorly printed that you can't read the numbers up close let alone 14 inches away. While it didn't cost a lot, what I paid for it is too much, since the product is useless."
2,Decent,"This pocket eye chart was purchased for physical exams for medical school. My one qualm about the item is that it is so thin, that you can see light through the item. There are black stripes on the sides of the back that also hinder reading the letters that fall in front of them. I ended up purchasing a different card that was more opaque that worked much better."
2,Alone again,"Maybe my standards are just too high, but once again I find myself in the minority when it comes to rating a book.I read the trade paperback edition, published as Counterpoint, so perhaps the St. Martins mass-market edition benefited from some vigorous editing. Heaven knows the book needed it.What was it lacking? Pacing, any insight into those involved, decent exposition on how they came to be involved, a strong sense of chronology and cause-and-effect. I'd have learned as much in a great deal less time by reading a decent magazine article about the case."
3,True Crime from A Tragic Historical Area,"Was there a curse laid on the women on Salem that made them lose immunity to their prey, first the witch burners and Puritan judges of 17th century America and then, to Tom Maimoni, an animal who walked in the shoes of a man? Martha surely must have felt the pangs of history as she succumbed to the murderous rage of Maimoni. Margaret Press' COUNTERPOINT tells two stories, widely separated in time, and makes the reader wonder, in a terribly shivery way, what the connection is between a long ago religious madness, and the sociopathic misogyny of a modern monster. Quite an impresssive effort."
2,A book of lists,"This is the sixth book I have read on the topic of small groups, and thus far it is my least favorite. Perhaps it is a matter of preferred style, but I could never get into this book. The author seems to do nothing but make a series of lists throughout the entire book. The reader is never introduced to the main thought of a passage followed by logical support of that thought. I personally felt I was reading a set of cliff notes on small groups.Once one advances beyond the writing style, the book does have a good amount of useful information. A busy small-group lay leader, who simply wants a checklist of things to consider, would probably find this book very helpful. However, the scholar who is looking to study small groups would find other books more useful. (for example Julie Gorman's book on Christian community or Icenogle's book on Biblical foundations for small groups)"
3,small groups,"While the book was as advertised content was not exactly what I had hoped.It's easy to understand and has many good ideas. I give the author credit for having presented the information well, yet due to content alone, I was disappointed and will look elsewhere. Others I'm sure, would find the book helpful."
1,Daewoo Woes,My Daewoo stopped reading discs after a year of light use by one user. Used cleaning disc numerous times but it didn't help. Just out of warranty. Same experience as other Daewoo dvd player owner.
1,Daewoo,"I've had two Daewoo dvd players, one was a normal player and the other was a multi-region. Both of these players after a year or so of normal use just stopped reading discs completely. Cleaning the player did not help. I am now trying to find a better mutli-region player that will LAST. If you are only interested in a years worth of use then this for you, otherwise I'd do what I'm doing and find an alternative."
1,Don't waste your money,Looking for a book for my 5 year old adopted child. This book is not it. I would not recommend.
4,NICE GIVE IT A SPIN !,"Cristina has a great voice and the material here is pretty good the playing is first class yes she may sound like some of the other's out there but she also has her own groove, very enjoyable and solid thruout.4 STAR'SFavorite song's Mi Ritmo Calinte,Vivan los ninos,and tracks 1 and 2"
3,Without saying 'how' after a third of the book,"It takes too long to give us constructive suggestions. He tells us repeatedly in chapter's' that we should be careful and should not speed. I guess, if we have already bought the book, we are those who want to be safe and so, constructive suggestions will be our central needs."
3,Set incomplete - needs adapter ring,"These filters do not work on a CoolPix 5000 without a Nikon adapter ring UR-5. A cryptologist reading the editorial reviews probably could have figured out that ""UV POLARIZER ND4 ND8 UR-E5 REQ D"" means that the filters are too large for the camera requiring another piece of hardware. The filters appear to be first rate. Good quality case, although there is no storage for an adapter. Nikon should sell these to CoolPix 5000 owners in a set including the adapter."
4,Good for the price,"Painted a house using these,not as nice as purdy nap-but great for primer or even top coat with flat paint and/or if you aren't painting a multi-million dollar home."
5,Red River Crossing by Kent Conwell,"If you have never read one of Kent Conwell's books, you are missing a lot. And this one only proves that he gets better and better. I enjoyed reading this. Mr. Conwell not only makes believable characters but he instills humor, action and emotion in his works. When I read the part about the boil, I could picture the whole event the way he expressed it on paper. He is an excellent writer. Of all his books that I have read, I have enjoyed every single one of them. Red River Crossing was no exception. A five stars, and a two thumbs upward. This book is wonderfully written and fantastic!"
3,WinZip,This book is useful for learning the potential of the WinZip program. Unfortunately the information is somewhat out of date.
3,The Ugly Sea,"Focuses on dark, unknown and irrelevant portions of the oceans, such as Britain's coast..."
3,The Sea,"I see why the bargain price on this book. Some really good pictures, a lot of repetitious not-quite-good shots. Somewhat disappointing."
5,Spell binding and easy read,"A very long historically based book that is well written but avoids being heavy even if colonial India is not of particular interest. Difficult to put down, very exciting and at times tear inducing."
4,Handy Cabling,"This retractable cable set is so handy! I hate having wires all over the place and it's so easy to store. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the cable ends by the AV connectors seem a bit fragile. It would be nice if they could bulk them up a bit. Other than that, it's a great buy!"
1,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"They dont ACTUALLY have this item anymore. they will instead send you another item that is similar... sort of.they will refund your money when you tell them the item they sent is wrong, however really this item should just be removed. the company explicitly said they no longer carry this item."
3,"Ok, but not great for a home stereo","I bought these to use my ipod through my home stereo system and they work, but the sound quality just isn't that great. For small/portable stereo's they are fine, but for a rack system I wound up buying something else."
1,BEWARE!,"Do not waste your time or moneyMy 37"" HDTV LCD only worked for two weeks.If I had done more online research I could have saved a lot of money.I am out $900.00 ($170.00 to ship it back to Protron for warranty work)3 months and still no TV and nobody in customer service will give me a straight answer... their standard line is ""call back in 3 weeks and we may have a replacement in stock""Do not buy!ProsonicProtronSpectronIQ (same company, different names)"
1,AVOID ANY PROTRON or SPECTRON IQ PRODUCT!!!,"This is the most disreputable company I have had the misfortune to deal with in my life. I own four electronic products from this company. Only one is still working (32"" LCD). If you return a non working product they will never return it or respond to you in any meaningful way. Please research before buying anything from this company. The previous review is completely accurate."
3,POOR SERVICE,"TV is nice, good picture but remote control won't work all the time.They said they would send a new remote, here it is a month later and no new remote."
3,Medicore,"Nice photos of a few interesting ideas. No construction detail, few cat photos. Review requires seven more words so here there are."
2,WARNING: THIS IS POSSIBLY THE MINIATURE VERSION!,"This review is intended only for the 3.5"" x 3.5"" version of this book. The full-size book is wonderful, and deserves all five stars. I just attempted to buy two copies to give as gifts. Alas, I ended up with the miniature versions, which have most of the content, but at less than a fifth of the size, are hardly worth their present cost of half the price. Check the product details closely, and make sure you're getting what you think you're getting--the product description doesn't make it very obvious. If you're paying less than $$$ for this book, you're likely buying a wallet-sized version."
5,Interesting book,"I was looking for some ideas to let my cat run around the walls of the denfrom his tower. Very interesting ideas but, I needed something that wasnot attached to the walls permanently.Good ideas, but not what I was looking for."
1,The Cat's House,"I would not recommend this book. I bought it thinking it was going to help me build my own cat's house. Was I wrong. The book is very small, about 3&1/2"" square. I could hardly see the pictures in this book. A complete waste of money if you ask me. I was very disappointed when I received this book."
1,not interesting for catlovers !!!,"This is really not a nice book, it shows more of that awful house, with skelets stuff, then that it shows you cats. Afwul colors too !!! Better buy photobooks from Hans Silvester, he really shows nice cats.!!!!!"
4,Neat Ideas & Pictures - not a do it yourself handbook,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but the Booklist review is right: it is not a do-it-yourself handbook. Instructions for doing what the authors did to their home (which looks spectacular) are sparse. But this book is about inspiration, and it delivers that very well. It is mostly a picture book, and as much is devoted to the cats themselves as to the interior design. There are ideas galore in here for cat-nuts who want to create cat-heaven. Jim Kee"
4,"A ""must read"" for cat lovers!",I wish the book was longer! Walker's evolving creation is an architectural monument to some very lucky cats. (I wish he would've gone into more detail on the 'how to' part of the process.)
5,The Cats' House,"One of the most inspiring books. When planning suprises to my cats i normally have a peak in this book... not doing exatly like this, but the essence of giving fun adventure for cats is ...fun. Fantastic!"
1,"Great at first, but smells like crap after a while -- literally","When it's newly sprayed on, it does smell great and it's sold really cheaply nowadays. It smells fabulous, strong but not too strong, and it's good if you're young and a trendy dresser. If it smelt like that consistently, it would be my favourite cologne.See, some perfumes spoil when they are exposed to sunlight or air. The problem with Colours is that it spoils that way, but it does it rather quickly, and it starts to smell repulsive. The smell can get rather strong and it gets embarrassing when you're out for the whole day. It's probably the only cologne you wish would fade away quickly.So, beware when you're trying the tester out. Don't buy this one immediately. Spray some on a tester card and wait. You'll be happy you didn't take this stinker home."
5,Good Stuff,"This charger works like a charm. Took kind of a long time to ship/arrive, but it was within the allotted time stated, so all expectations were met. Good stuff."
4,CD?,This was my first Herb Alpert record that I bought at age 7 in the summer of 1966. The Winds of Barcelona will always be my favorite Herb Alpert song. I have gone back and bought every other Tijuana Brass original album since they came out on CD. I am still waiting for this one! My collection can never be complete without it. When is it finally coming out on CD?????
2,VHS is cut version of film shown on tv,"For what it's worth, the great sex scene here with Heidi SCHANZ (not Kluge like some dimwit mentioned) was apparently chopped a little between being telecast on HBO and released on video. I can't find any evidence that there is an uncut version available for purchase, so this is it. Shame too, because those few seconds made this practically as hot as the uncut Spader/Amick scene in ""Dream Lover"". Buy this only for the rare gem Heidi SCHANZ!!UPDATE: The DVD has restored the full sex scene with the previously-trimmed overhead shots."
5,AMAZON HAS THE WRONG SAMPLED MUSIC FOR THIS ALBUM!,"If you hear what you think sounds like a soulful female signer coming on in the samples...then it's still not been corrected, and the samples are from the wrong album."
4,Great Book,This book is great in giving balance to the child's world. Very important to know that dangers exist but not with everyone everywhere. This book launches a child into developing caution when dealing with people he/she doesn't know.
2,Not for Preschoolers,"I found myself having to reword many sentences in the book for my 4-year old granddaughter. She's at the age where we are trying very hard to educate her about strangers but this book is written for more mature children for some reason. I mean, c'mon, it's the Berenstain Bears but it's written in a vocabulary style that my granddaughter certainly would not have understood if I had read it word for word. Guess I'll just have to just keep making up my own stories!"
4,"One of the least paranoia inducing ""stranger books""","I have gotten rid of most ""don't talk to strangers"" books because they are mostly fear inducing. I want my children to use common sense, and this version emphasises that. Sister (gotta love the names :-) ) fears everyone when first told that not all strangers are trustworthy. Mama comes to the rescue with some much needed common sense and moderation. The book concludes with a plausible example of Brother maybe trusting a stranger too much.A good starting point for working with young, very trusting children, on appropriate interpersonal interactions, and may help prevent the child from fearing even the grocery store clerk."
5,outstanding!!!,this book is so important and fun to read when talking about strangers...it is a MUST for the little ones!
5,My son loves it.,"My son was so exited to get this book, and frankly, so was I. We read it to him several times and he still wants us to. Great Buy!"
4,Dont talk to Strangers,"I thought this book was very helpful for kids, to teach them that its not wise to talk to strangers. I know because when I was little I used to talk to strangers, then my mom and me sat down and talked about strangers that I meet and greet, and how I should not do that because I do not know the people that I am talking to. Anyone who does not know not to talk to strangers should read this book."
4,Great Lesson,"My 4 year old loves this book. It does a good job teaching kids about strangers without scaring them. It's a little old fashioned in the sense that brother bear has interests like model airplanes, soccer, etc... and sister bear ""has many other interests"" but this doesn't really take away from the lessons being learned. We have another Berenstain book, ""The Bearscouts"", that is decades old and the whole book rhymes. I have been looking for some other rhyming Berrenstain books without success and would love to find some. Can Amazon help me out with this???"
2,Not a good explanation,"Bought this for my 4 year old son to help talk to him about strangers, and what they are, and who they are. This doesn't help explain that. An ok story, but he lost interest in this book before I was done reading it. And he loves to read books."
3,What about the rest of the strangers?,"The book does teach children about what to do with strangers, but the view of strangers is not appropriate. They are all darkened men. A more developmentally-appropriate, anti-bias book would include strangers of all races, class, personality, and gender."
3,"Good, but maybe not for very small children","I guess this is a good place to start, but it's a little too nuanced for small kids. I would recommend this book for five and up, but then again, I'm no expert"
4,Bernstain Bear Lover,"I LOVE the Bear books, this is a very good book, great story. But if you are looking for a book to teach your kids about strangers, more in-depth, I would try adding another book or two, this one is about stranger danger, and talks about how not every stranger is bad, but I feel our kids need a little more detail."
4,"Good for learning, not great for workout","I bought this dvd because I thought it would be a fun workout. As it turns out, the instructor gives an excellent demonstration of the movements- with various angles shown- but she only does the movement for a few seconds with no workout routine until all moves are learned, so don't find it useful for a workout."
4,dance,I love the way the dance is broken down into small sections. Before you know it you are doing the whole dance.
2,Not for the Beginner,"I am an absolute beginner to bellydance and this video was not very helpful. My biggest complaint was that the pace was very fast. There were very few repetitions of the moves, so I was constantly hitting the rewind butting to figure out what I missed or try the move again so I could do it well.Sections of DVD: Stretching, Traning, Combos, DancePros:Fast pacedJillian moves as she explains so you can see various anglesCons:Moves are not explained very wellThe basic stance is never givenThe pace is very fast, with few repetitions (around 1 minute per move)Very few stretches to warm-upOnly a few beginner moves are shown, mixed in with intermediate movesRecap: This is NOT a video for an absolute beginner."
4,Instructional Bellydance with Jullina: Level 1,IT was good. nice and slow and then slowly adding on. great for beginners.
1,Horrid,This was the worst bellydancing video I have ever had the misfortune of viewing. She spends more time dancing in front of the mirror idolizing herself than she does instructing the viewers on how to perform the routine. You constantly have to rewind and rewind and rewind some more to practice the moves. She only spends a few seconds on each move.P.S. If I would have been allowed to I would NOT have given it a star but the system did not let me proceed without rating it.. I give it a double thumbs down. This was simply HORRID.
4,needs better chapter clickability,"This is a good dvd. Her dancing is great, her teaching is clear, and the combos with all the pretty footwork and moves are beautiful. I have only one complaint on this dvd, but unfortunately, it's a major problem: she has 7 combinations, but there is no way to click on each one. so they are all seven in one chapter. so you can't pick number 3 for example and click on it to practice just that one over and over. you have to rewind. it is very slow and annoying.and I think her combos are complicated enough to need to learn and practice each one separately over and over. so. she has a ton of great stuff on here, but the way they made the dvd, it's very time wasting to access just one combo. so i ended up not really doing it. cause it was too annoying to find the one I wanted. Because of this one little problem, the enjoyability of the video went way down. I think they should re-release the whole set and fix this problem. I would buy it again."
3,Not good for first time belly dancers,"This video moves very fast. If you have never tried belly dancing before, I recommend something more like Veena and Neena Belly Dance for Beginners. Luckily I have taken some classes or I would have been so lost! I did like the way that you get to learn an actual dance, where she breaks down the combos. The music is good too. Overall this tape is best for dancers who are beginners but have some experience belly dancing."
3,Okay for first-timers,This is a good way for beginners to start. It teaches a few basic moves and 1 routine. I like watching Jillina perform but didn't get as much instruction as I was hoping for. I'm a beginner myself and was looking for more in way of technique and moves. I ended up having to buy a few more DVDs that provided a larger range of teaching.
3,NOT FOR THE ABSOLUTE BEGINNER,"While I love watching Jillina dance, I found it hard to follow along with her instruction as she is too fast. I watched it twice and did the techniques section twice, but did not attempt the combinations as I feel I need to master the basics before moving on. I thought that a beginner DVD would focus more on learning the basics and I don't think this DVD does. I bought it to supplement my weekly bellydance classes. Being a relatively quick learner, I bought it based on reviews and ignored others who said that it was not for beginners. I have to admit that they are right. This tape is much more suited to advanced beginners. I am sure that I will use this tape once I get more experience (have only had two classes), but for now I will be checking out other ""Level 1"" instructional DVDs and will report my findings."
4,Pretty good for beginners.,"Overall I found this to be a good DVD. Jillina starts out by going through basic moves. She does an excellent job of describing how to do them and demostrating. But she does move through this section a bit quickly. But you can always back it up and watch it again.She then moves on to a combinations section. She teaches various ways to combine basic moves.She then moves on to the choreography. She uses a lot of the stuff she taught in the combination section. She goes through it verbally and slowly at first, then does it to music.She ends with a beautiful performance of the choreography and throws in a bit extra.Overall a great DVD to start out with. I will admit it is a bit easier to follow if you have some experience under your belt. But this is still a better DVD than most beginner dvds I've seen."
4,Fast But Not Too Fast,"I enjoyed this dvd. I must admit, when I first saw her dance I did not think she was as talented as others that I have seen. However, I like the choreography that she did. It is not so simple that you are immediately bored with it, and it is not so hard that it takes weeks to master each move.This is certainly not a total beginner's dvd. It takes a little knowledge of bellydance and a little coordination to keep up with her. I guess you could always rewind it over and over again if you are having trouble.Overall, pretty good job. I even broke a sweat when I first started learning it."
4,"Good DVD, but not for newbies","Jillina is a great dancer and teacher. I would caution anyone brand new to bellydance to gather a little experience (think Neena and Veena) before taking on this DVD. She does go a little fast, and some skipping back for a repeat is bound to happen. Jillina does reference some other dance styles, but I didn't find it hard to figure out what she was getting at. Her use of the mirror is handy, and I felt she explained the moves well."
1,wonderbread bellydance,"I am so disappointed in this dvd. This woman has no personality in her dance or her instruction.I would have gladly endured this if she had been a competent instructor, but she seems to feel that if she shows something once with a botox smile, it is enough.This is not what bellydance is about. It is about what little isolation exercises are about. She has the body of a ""western dancer"", so all of the affirmation I hoped to get from a little ""curve"" was also ditched. I am quite surprised that so many people recommended this dvd. That is the only reason I bought it. People seemed to think that this was at least well taught. I wish it had been. I'm just glad I only bought one dvd rather than the set of three."
5,Jillina is the Ultimate instructor!!,"I am a huge fan of Jillina so I knew that I would not be dissappointed with my purchase...and I was right. If you are out of shape or not a belly dancer already, I can see how this instruction might be a little tough for you. But with a little self-discipline, practice and dedication, you will be moving and shimmying with no problem. Don't skip over any sections as they are all related to each other and help you to learn the correct techniques. If you are already a belly dancer, you will come away from this instruction with new choreographies, great combos and a clearer understanding of crucial movements and techniques that are sure to enhance your performances!"
1,What a waste!,"I got this on sale for $2, and even at that price, found it worthless. She only teases you, showing the moves very briefly and instructing very frugally. Then... she just dances, and dances, and dances, expecting you to be able to follow her! Maybe it would be OK for Level 10, but why call it ""Level 1""? By the way, for ANY level it would be barely OK, since her cameraman doesn't know his job."
5,Very helpful,"I just got this dvd in an attempt to try something different. I wanted to do something that was fun in my spare time and learn something new. I have always been interested and dance and thought I'd try bellydancing. I was nervous about whether this dvd would help me to learn or not, but it is very helpful. Those who say it is not good for beginners have not spent the time to learn it. The dvd breaks down the techniques for you to learn. Although I am still trying to get those down, the instruction is very helpful, but practicing it is essential! I wanted a little bit of a challenge when I was looking for a dvd, and this is definitely both helpful and challenging. I am looking forward to learning the fulll choreography. It's a lot of fun and I recomend this dvd to anyone who is up for the challenge to learn and have fun!"
5,Great help in Japanese study!,"This book is one of the best self-study guides I've ever laid my eyes on! The instructions are very clear, starting with tips on how to learn the characters best, and ending with the direction of the brush strokes when writing them. If you are serious about learning Japanese, I would definitely recommend this wonderful book."
2,Not Impressed,Was hoping for something a little different; something fun to listen to during the holidays. The songs and the sounds are weak -- nothing stands out -- except for how bad Silent Night really is. Twisted Sister Christmas is much better.
5,My favorite Christmas CD,I buy every 80 hair cd I can find and a really like this one there are i think 2 songs that could have been better but the rest are great!
5,A Great Compilation,"These bands are kind of before my time, but I love Christmas music and after hearing snippets of the songs, I decided to buy the album. I love it! Every song is very fun and entertaining. Faster Pussycat's version of ""Silent Night"" is unfortunately the least appealing track on the CD, but the rest of the songs more than make up for it. If you're a Christmas music junkie like me, I highly recommend adding this CD to your collection."
4,Christmas with a twist,"The best tracks are Danger Danger's ""Naughty Naughty Xmas"" as featured in the film ""The Santa Clause 2"" and Warrant's version of the Kinks classic ""Father Christmas""."
2,Very disapointed.,The fabric was very cheap and looked as half of it had been stretched too far I am very disappointed with this purchase but i guess you get what you pay for with this dress.
1,No Video!,"As the previous reviewer says, ""the only compelling reason to purchase this CD is the 'Weapon of Choice' music video on the 'enhanced' portion of the disc."" Based on that, I decided to get the CD for the video, but it came yesterday, and there's no video on the CD. In fact, it's not an enhanced CD at all."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!,"Just like another Carole Marsh book I just read, this book DOES NOT tell you how to make millions. It just says that in the title to get you to buy it. It is 34 pages worth of NOTHING. Total fluff and bull-oney. The title is basically an outright lie. This home-made ""book"" (if you can call it that) just talks about some general ideas of how great it is to put books into multimedia format, bla bla bla... but NEVER tells you HOW to make money! It just says things like - ...and you'll be on your way to making millions- without ever telling you HOW. Therefore, the title is a lie."
2,very little information,The book is interesting to read because it offers a generous dosage of second person pronouns. But it is only 34 pages long and contains very little information in those 34 pages.
5,Superb introduction into the value of myth,"This book was the first book that I not only loved, but devoured. I carried it with me and had my parents read it to me. Soon, I was reading these stories over and over by myself. The drawings are only ok, but there are plenty of them. The stories come from Greek, Chinese, Aesop, Hebrew, British and even American sources. These are the kind of stories that teach lessons in morality and logic. Unfortunately, the classic myths that are the basis of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are not included. After all, the book was published in 1951 when calling the Bible mythical would be considered revolutionary. I've included the biblical myths in my son's education.Now, the book belongs to my 7 year old son, and he cherishes the stories as much as I did. My edition is falling apart, and yet this book is one of the most valuable in our entire library. This book is a must for a developing mind.Garth Libre"
5,Living Dharma,"This book is highly recommended and truly wonderful. Its age is irrelevant to its content and meaning. It conveys the whole scope of Theravada Buddhism in a concise and ageless fashion. I bought this when relatively new to meditation and Buddhism. However, it opened new doors to my practice. It teaches one that there is no one way, even in supposedly ""simple"" vipassana meditation and Buddhism, to the truth. But, yet, there remains only one truth. That, alone, is worth the price of admission. Beyond that, there are many examples of different practices and how to reach one's goal. It really and simply opens one's eyes to the diversity of Theraveda Buddhism and the one truth contained therein."
5,Beautiful picture book! Lovely story!,"A beautiful story about a young girl living in poverty in the Appalachia area in an earlier time period. Her father is sick and unable to work and she will not be able to attend school come winter, because she has no coat (and walks to school). The story shows how the women in the community come together to make her coat. It also shows the power of a stories passed down, and how school children treat each other. A very moving story for adults and children alike!"
5,deeply moving story of dealing with sorrow and teasing,"I must confess, I was not prepared to read my 5 year old a book on death...and I was a little shocked to find out during my first time reading it to her (I guess I should have pre-read it). Even so, I loved it, and so did she! This story deals with the sorrow of death and the humiliation of poverty in a real and positive way, without being sentimental. It is beautiful to see a child come up with a loving solution to her problems."
3,Through The Shadowlands,"Millions are familiar with the two movie versions and the theatrical drama Shadowlands. Even more people than that have read CS Lewis and will soon see the start of the Narnia saga on the big screen. To gain a greater appreciation of his work and be able to view further depths hidden inside the profound writings that have helped uncounted scores of Christans find their way, read this book. In a manner that almost reads like a novel itself, the author recounts how both Lewis and Joy became the people so adeptly portrayed by Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. You will see how much they truly loved each other. Even if you are not fan of CS Lewis, it is an incredible romance that will give hope to many who have spent their lives looking for, yet not finding, love."
5,Awesome book!!!!!!!!!,This was a fantastic book about CS Lewis and his wife Joy. It is all about their lives and then how they met and fell in love. The condition of the book was very good as well. And the cover itself was beautiful!
4,Loved this book,"AFter watching the movie which I believe was called ""Shadowlands"", I was anxious to learn more about Jack and Joy. I found ""Through the Shadowlands"" on Amazon, and ordered it. Although this is a non-fiction book, using the writings of both plus recollections of many friends, I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in C.S. Lewis, his literary as well as his spiritual life. Joy Davidman is also a fascinating person, just about the opposite to Mr. Lewis. The book arrived in good time, and was brand new, as listed."
2,"Deep, deep, deep.","Okay - so a cast of three was pretty impressive. Charles Dance was incredibly impressive.But the silly struggle of emotions between Lou Diamond and Mia was out of place and just bad. Their reactions to situations was terrible. Lou Diamond's mock-rage in the rain, in the truck were like a wacky Godzilla acting lesson. It didn't get better. And the sudden sex between the two characters was just whacked considering the positions they were in already.It was worth 1 watch and 1 watch only on a lazy Sunday afternoon with no better prospects."
4,Trader Redux remake by new publisher,"This book appears to be a remake of James Axler's book Trader Redux published a couple years ago. The only difference is that he has a new publisher for the same book.Publishing this book December 2002, is apparently the same book published by someone else.Be careful.I could be wrong, but since I read Trader Redux a couple years ago it is probably the same book."
1,MYTH,If you thinking of this book ? It writing of Paul ...Who is Myth also. Speaks in Lies ..Myths ! Pagan Lord
1,Bin it,"More ignorant ramblings from someone who hasn't done any research, which is typical of the rabid Christian."
4,Great choreography dvd for intermediate/advance dancers,Jillina strong point is her choreographies and it shows in this DVD. Very well produced dvd. It starts off with a sample performance in costume of the choreography she will teach. She then does a quick warm-up. She goes into teaching some movements. From there she shows combinations 1st without music then practicing with music. She then proceeds to teach the choreography which is the combinations previously taught just slightly varied. She keeps patiently building onto the choreography. In the end she performs in the end in costume. From her she injects her great sense of showmanship.Jillina's outfit is beautiful yet functional while she is teaching. You can see her clearly from the background.I would recommend this for intermediate and advanced dancers. I don't think she goes into enough detail for a beginner.
1,Jillina cannot teach nor can she inspire,"This is a VERY superficial instruction. Most importantly, where is drilling?! Jillina just dances at high speed, and expects not-so-advanced students to follow along.That could still have some value if her dancing was truly beautiful. But I find it boring. She doesn't come across as enjoying herself. During instruction she looks bored, and her occasional fake smiling doesn't help. During dancing she perked up, but her perky counting only killed my already weak desire to follow her. I need to learn how to dance; I already know how to count, thanks!This just looks like a home video made by Jillina's friend (apparently after a good number of drinks) at their leisure. There is nothing professional about it."
5,"Easy to Follow, excellent for all",I just love the Jillina dvd's. She is very easy to follow which makes this excellent for a beginner and easy for experienced dancers. She repeats the steps which is a huge plus for me.
4,Real Life Italian Gangster without Mafia ties,"Super handsome bad boy Italian gangster Renato Vallanzasca terrorized Milan in the 1970's and 80's. He is no Tony Soprano, that is, he isn't Mobbed up. He was an independent contractor. I saw this in the theater and then purchased the DVD. Why? I study the Italian language and Renato speaks the language perfectly and without dialect. He even beats up a prison guard for speaking slang to him and using the informal 2nd person singular form of address. Kim Rossi Stuart is a hottie. Could he be the new Marcello Mastroianni? Forse."
5,PERHAPS THE MOST UNDERRATED METAL BAND,"This is a great CD to have if you are a fan of 80's heavy metalSaxon has always been a good hard-rocking band, but for reasonsunknown never made it big in the United States. They are much better known in Europe. Saxon came up around the same time thatother british bands like Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest were making themselves known. However, those bands made aname for themselves in America while Saxon was left behind. It'sreally a shame because I always believed that Saxon had just asmuch talent as those bands. Anyways, back to the CD. This CD contains a bunch of killer tracks. My personal favorites are Dallas 1pm(really good!!), Wheels of Steel(awsome!!), Strong Arm Of the Law(Rocks!!), and Denim And Leather."
5,My Favorite Remedial Phonics Book,"I've been a volunteer phonics tutor for 10 years. This is my favorite book to use. I've also developed my own phonics lessons and games, but I reach for this book often to review areas my students are stuggling with. It's well laid out and teaches all the phonics rules and principles you need to know in an orderly fashion."
2,Book about Molestation & Rape of children,"Good writing, but does that justify itself? The subject matter is very disturbing, it is all about a serial rapist, who totures and molest young boys with horrifying objects and then kills them. Yes, I could not put it down, but in the end, I wished I could've taken a brillo pad to my brain. I regret reading it and hope to alert anyone who is sensitive to this kind of material."
2,Uderzo was no Goscinny,"No Asterix book is worth ONE star (sorry Elizabeth). However, this isn't anywhere near the classic Asterix standard (6 stars, at least!) , possibly some of the finest and most subtle (yes, there's loads of subtle stuff along with the obvious jokes) humour around.Unfortunately, this book shares the problems of all the books after Rene died...Goscinny is a great illustrator...hence the two stars (and Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge are superb translators), but the jokes and the plot...ah Rene, how we all wish you were alive."
3,Asterix deals with a new problem,"First published in French in 1991 as La Rose et Le Glaive and in English the same year.The cohesion of the village we know so well is thrown into disarray, when a radical feminist Bard moves into the village to replace Cacofonix. This results in the men of the village moving out!Meanwhile Julius Caesar. Has come up with his latest plan to defeat the village, a garrison of beautiful female legionnaires arrives in the local Roman camp. The Gauls cannot hit them, covered as they are by the code of Gaullish gallantry. Bravura, luckily, together with Asterix, with whom she has been at loggerheads come up with a plan to save the day.This one deals head on with the gender debate, in a charming and fun way. Even if a lot of the humour has been recycled from previous Asterix books."
5,Tired? Frustrated? Fed up? Get this CD!,"My favorite Arrogant Worms recording - so many fun songs, and one of their best - Drink With Me!. This has become my full-time driving CD, as it helps me deal more calmly with the daily onslaught of suicidal drivers on the commute. It's also surprising how easy it is to find an appropriate song for most adventures - for instance, a family performance of 'Billy, the Theme Park Shark' made a recent trip to the Aquarium that much more fun for everyone. The best description of this kind of song I've ever heard is ""children's songs for adults"". If you like Heywood Banks, Wierd Al Yankovic or Flanders and Swann, this is the music for you. You don't even have to be Canadian (although I'm sure it helps)."
5,Great independent film,"This is a great independent film, well worth the purchase, and I can see why it won the awards it did. A lot of guys would love to have Jason's Problem... Quality writing throughout as several of the scenes could have easily been skits on SNL."
5,Clever and uproariously funny!,"Jason's Big Problem will keep you laughing from start to finish! From the hilarious supporting cast to the clever writing, this movie is sure to become a cult classic!"
4,Best choice for computer,I bought them a year ago. The sound is crisp. Price is reasonable. Go for them.
2,Poor Quality Control,"I was thrilled to be able to order Salt Free Sesame Melba Toast, a long time favorite of mine, but found the quality distinctly poorer than usual. Instead of five pieces per inner package there were four plus a small imperfect piece. Almost all were too darkly toasted. Many arrived in crumbled pieces--not due to the mailing package. The individual boxes had been crushed. Now the product is no longer available from Old London. Just as well, I guess, but now where will I find salt free sesame melba toast?"
1,I don't know what this IS!,"The REAL Flip Wilson was GREAT. . .I did not know who this was when I ordered it. Amazon spelled his name like the REAL Flip Wilson, but on the CD it is different. I did not open this!!!! I think it is something RADICAL! I enjoy simple comedy, not controversy! I am sending it back!"
4,Very good solid performance,"Ignacio Rodes' performance of these 4 guitar sonatas, three were premiers when this CD was released in 1993, are very good especially in the Ginastera but I did like Eduardo Fernandez's performance better because it was more dramatic. Unfortunately it is no longer available. The Brouwer sonata is particularly good musically and Rodes does fine with it. The recording is very good as well. However, I did like Miguel Trapaga performance and recording of the Brouwer better on another Opera Tres recording (#1031 ASIN: B00003O9IA) again because Trapaga shows more passion and the sound is warmer. The Espla and Bardwell sonatas are less interesting but still good. Overall, this is a very good CD."
3,Didn't really Help with Rear end ground clearance,"The spare tire mounted in the rear of my 2005 Freestar still slams on the ground when I back out of my driveway, with less that a 1000 lb. load. Worth a try."
3,"Works, but will burn.","I'm dying to find a feminine cleanser that doesn't burn when I use it and I have yet to find one. I am only using this stuff currently on recommendation and it does clean well, it just isn't as gentle as I would like."
1,"product good, its just not for me","this was shipped very quick, but when I used it my entire body broke out in huge blotches. My body is just too sensitive."
4,Trance+formation,"I took to listening to Chicane after I heard snippets of the new Chicane CD, 'Behind the Sun' in India. 'Strong in Love' is excellent, with cool, ambient synths and eclectic drum patterns. This is the stuff that dream (trance) is made of. Highly recommended."
3,Not very bright,This flashlight seems well built and works fine. The white light is not very bright and the green actually looks brighter. It does not have a perfectly clean beam pattern but good enough for walking around the yard at night. The white lights are actually so dim that if I wanted to have a good white light I'd have to grab another flashlight. If this breaks I will not buy it again.
3,Decent,I've enjoyed this flashlight on hunts or just finding my way through the house at night. The only thing i've noticed lately is that the lights begining to flicker. Not sure but the Led lights have been holding up. Also i wish the light projected further.
4,Merry Magic indeed,Eric Reed's piano work is always enjoyable to listen to and this disk is no exception. This CD has some fresh approaches to some tired old tunes and I find it a refreshing disk to listen to on a cold December night. It evokes the right mood for Christmas time and makes for great listening.
2,A once pioneering work now needs a serious revision to stay relevant,"Given as a gift years ago, I finally took it upon myself to read DeMente's pioneering work Japanese Etiquette & Ethics in Business. The book's historical perspective on modern day business practices and the explanation of fundamental East-West cultural differences are insightful. That said, the book [now in its 6th(or 7th?) Edition] has developed Schizophrenia; often developing ideas that are later contradicted and switching incongruously between timeframes. The usage of and reference to Japanese is antiquated, marked by mistranslation and an awkward treatment better left to a serious Japanese language text. Although the book may have been ""pioneering"" when it was published in 1959, I suspect there are far more encompassing and contemporary books now available."
4,Underrated action film.,"Recently I purchased a DVD player capable of playingDVD's in the European PAL standard as well as AmericanNTSC discs. This film is not on a domestic DVD, and Iwanted to replace my VHS version. So I was very pleased to see this and in an excellent transfer aswell. the foreign subtitles can be switched off. This discwas from the Netherlands (!). This is a totallyunpredictable story, and the casting is just aboutperfect."
2,nite man,Hard to review an item that was unplayable. Marketer should be clearer that foreign created software will not work on stateside machines
3,Another Family Friendly Flick from the Hulkster,"""The Secret Agent Club"" is probably one of Hulk Hogan's better vehicles. Well... at least it's a major imrovement over ""Santa With Muscles"".The plot is straight foward enough. Hogan plays a secret agent who steals a prototype laser gun away from some bad guys(played hammily by Lesley Ann Down and Richard Moll). Back at home, Hogan(whose own son doesn't know what he really does for a living) has his cover blown when he is kidnapped by the bad guys. The gun falls into the hands of the son who hatches a plan to rescue his dad with the help of his young friends.Pretty typical family action film, mainly notable for the fact that it predates the similarly themed(and far more successful) ""Spy Kids"". It has a few slow stretches, but overall ""The Secret Agent Club"" is a movie the kids will like... and the parents can tolerate."
5,A superb introduction to the world of the bazaar.,"I have traveled extensively in the Middle East and North Africa, and my favorite places are the suqs, or bazaars of each city. I have actually visited half of the bazaars featured in this book, and therefore I can attest to the accuracy of the information provided. This book captures the variety, texture, and atmosphere of the bazaar. The only aspects missing are the sounds and the aromas. Of special interest and value are the maps of each bazaar, for wandering through a suq can be an overpowering experience. Nowhere else have I come upon this type of information. The photos are well done, showing both the people and their surroundings accurately, but beautifully. This book makes me want to pay a return visit to a bazaar, soon."
5,Fascinating,"I checked this out of the library, and when I get back from Syria and Lebanon, am going to buy it. An entirely different perspective from anything I've ever seen. Even if it does omit anything about the ongoing conflicts of the region, we already know all of that. This tells us and shows us something we don't know. When I'm walking through the bazaars in Damascus and Aleppo, I will be carrying this book in my head and seeing everything differently because of it."
1,History of bazaar omits slavery,From 700 A.D. to 1900 A.D. the Islamic bazaar included a vigorous trade in humanity. Over 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their homes and pressed into slavery by the Islamic dynasties. Males slaves were castrated and sent to the fight the wars of the Islamic world. Female slaves went into harmes and household service.If a history of the Bazaar is attempted by this author it shoujld be complete and accurate.
4,wonderfully warm pop,"This is the pop record Air was trying to make with 10,000 Hz. Warm keyboards (with lots of electric piano, one of my favorite sounds), subtle electronics, great melodies. Andy Chase is better known as one-third of the sophisticated pop trio Ivy, but after this record, he'll be known as a pop auteur in his own right. Reclusive popster Eric Matthews helps out on many tracks as well. For fans of Prefab Sprout, the Pearlfishers, Matthews and the like. Very, very nice stuff."
1,DON&#65533;T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!,"As a lover of the horror genre, I was thrilled to see a new horror book by someone that didn't have the last name King, Koontz or Saul. I chose this book based on the reviews I saw on the web site, and boy was I sorry. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!This book has too many tired ideas and stories that go nowhere.From now on I will stick with writers with the last name King, Koontz or Saul. At least I know I will be getting good (if not great) stories to read!..."
1,Same Old Stories,"The only part of Regina Mitchell's review I agree with is that Mr. Keene's writing closely resembles that of an early Stephen King. I would like to see new horror writers develop their own style, which this author has not.And correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Regina Mitchell co-author (with Mr. Keene) ""Under Her Black Wings?"" How can we take her review seriously when she is so obviously biased? Can we see more reviews from the average reader (like myself) and not co-authors and friends of the author?"
2,broken letters,"this product is strong and durbale just like any lanyard should be. no complaints with the durabilty and usefullness but the letters were incomplete and were missing many spots. for example the d in United doesnt have a bottom, it looks like a big lowercase n"
2,Excessive shipping costs,Almost $9 shipping within the same state is not acceptable. I have shipped farther and heavier for less.Probably will not purchase from them again.
3,"Part one is okay, Part two is a complete rip-off","Silent Night Deadly Night Part 1-This movie is decent. It is not the best horror movie of all time but it is not completely horrible. It is very predictable, but at least there is a lot of action right at the beginning of the movie. I would give this part 3 stars.Silent Night Deadly Night Part 2-This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would say 3/4 of the movie is actually the flashback to part one. The movie is not that long to begin with and they end up showing you all of part one. You don't even need to watch part one. The acting is completely horrible. The only redeeming quality is that there are a few funny parts, so I did get to laugh.Unfortunately you have to buy these two together, I would rent part one but leave part two right in the store!!"
4,Both very good films,"I just got this today,and yeah i was very well satisfied.To me though the second one isnt as bad as everyone says it is,as soon as u get past all the flashbacks in it it definitly gets better. Well the first one is the best one out of the two (as if that wasnt obvious enough),the middle of it when hes at the orphinage and the toy store is a little boring at first but it explains what happens later on in the film. Now as the second one goes,its boring at the beggining with all the flashbacks from the first one and then it gets better. So yeah if you like 80s slasher flicks that are more original then i reccomend this movie"
5,Great Deal For 2 Nostalgia Inducing Classics,"It was difficult to find these movies. After my son and I watched some internet clips of Silent Night Deadly Night 2, we knew we had to own this movie. The cool thing is that it comes together with both films for a very cheap price."
1,Terrible movies!!,"""Silent Night Deadly Night"" is absolutely awful. The acting, production values and direction are so terrible in this movie that the movie comes off as a joke more than anything else. I was unbelievably bored with this flick. Also, part 2 is not even worth mentioning in this review as I could only get through a few minutes of that rubbish. Despite what seems like a decent plot, some movies just do not work, but when you couple a bad script with bad acting, you come up with garbage and such is the case with these two movies. If horror is your thing on Christmas, I recommend you check out ""Black Christmas"" which is one of the scariest movies ever made."
1,trash,what trash nothing about these films are good i mean i wasnt expecting gone with the wind just a fun cheezy slasher movie instead i got a boring rip off of halloween with complete nonsence and took forever to start the second one was mainly flash backs of the original and new flash backs with some new stuff really poorly made dont get this
5,"Silent Night, Deadly NightS","Silent Night, Deadly Night is a classic slasher. It caused an uproar when it was released because of the content. The dvd looks good and there is plenty of good extras.Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 is a fall on the floor laughing movie. The acting is bad but the lines are friggin hilarious. I listened to it with commentary on it and its great. They make the movie funnier then it already is.I loved both films and i'm glad I purchased this dvd. I consider Silent Night Deadly Night part 2 one of the funniest movies ever made, even though it was suppose to be taken seriously."
2,Don't waste your money,"I love horror movies, but I didn't like this movie at all. I was long & boring, or maybe it wasn't that long, but seemed to be since it was so boring. I thought it had a weird storyline. I didn't see a reason why it was ever banned. Part 2 was just another big disappointment. It replayed so much of part 1 that it really wasn't necessary for a part 2. Ten thumbs down, oh, I only got 2 & believe they're both down."
4,Great double feature,"I received it on time and in great shape and excellent quality, too bad the distributers did not incluide english subtitles for my family to watch it. But both movies are great."
3,I highly recommend this movie!,"It is SO bad that it is comical. Eric Freeman, who plays Ricky, is probably the most atrocious actor that this country has ever seen. The storyline in this one follows little Ricky's path to the darkside, and what a strange and laughable path it is! If you watch this movie to be scared, you will be sorely disappointed. But, if you want to see some horrible acting, lame storylines and eyebrows that defy the laws of physics, then you MUST check out this movie!"
2,What I Remember,"It seems long ago I had this book. If this is the same then it is a sometimes inaccurate Joy Division lyrics book with side by side Italian translation. The translation has a fixed right margin before the English lyric's left margin. There is a brief preface in Italian only, some nice photos, and at least with my edition a 7"" single with ""Incubation *1,"" ""Incubation *2"" ( AKA ""As You Said""), ""You're No Good for Me"" (the only place I've ever seen this song), and ""Komakino."" The Cover is diagonaly divided between black and grey with the word ""joy"" in the middle. Someone please let me know if this product is as I described, and if it is the same as the product labled ""Joy Division Bilingual Italian..."""
1,Quality of Subwoofer,"Do not buy this item it is very poor quality and cannot handle a lot of power, just spend the extra 30 bucks for the pioneer."
5,Satisfied,"Great Company. Always a wonderful product with affordable pricing. I've purchased many subwoofers over the years and Pyle has never disappointed, great bang for the buck. Superb sound, excellent quality in workmanship esthetics and function."
4,bump hard,"these subs bump, took at least a month to break em in i have 2 of them hookedup to a 2300 watt pyle amp. after listening to some tech n twiztid they bumb.they dont seem to wake up till half way, not shure if its my subs or ampbut i dont listen to it down anyway, who does with subs"
3,This is a good speaker..,"If you need a couple of subs, these are good speakers to buy. You can't beat the price and they take a pretty good beating. Make sure you get plenty of power to these speakers the sensitivity is not the greatest (like a high end speaker) but give them some power and good EQ they sound pretty darn good. I have them in a sealed box, a cubic foot or so of room, they don't hit the lowest tones so well, but hey they were really inexpensive.. Worth the money for sure!"
4,Great sub for the price,"I paired two of these in a dual ported box I made, with a 1100 watt (400rms) mono amp. They provide plenty of punch for rock. If you're looking for car-shaking bass move up to the ""12 Pyles. I am a fan of Pyle now, because of the value of these speakers. Super-heavy, and very durable. I have assembled 4 dual ported sub boxes thus far, not one complaint."
2,Cool for the price,"they sound good. cant complain much because they were a good bargain... just wished they lasted longer. Mine started sounding kinda iffy after several months. not recommended for true music heads, but for me, it served its purpose which was to give me a decent sound until I could afford to replace it with the woofer I truly wanted. They don't handle lows or highs very well but they do a good job with the mids. They rattled my trunk but i would have liked to hear more richness in the lower tones."
3,the successful chinese herbalist,"Good for a acupuncturist who wants to add a herb shop .Not real made for just a herbalist.I'm not a big fan of Bobs work, but is still great insight into TMC and opening a Apothecary."
3,Just not WH40Kish,"This story somehow doesn't feel like Warhammer portrayed in the GW games. In essence, it details the misadventures of a trader and his companion stumbling around lost for most of the book in the area of Imperial Space known as the Eye of Terror. The writing is functional and the characters are well done, but that's about it. Feels like a so-so episode of Star Trek - take away the Warhammer-specific names and you could make this book fit into any science fiction series. For WH40K I expected epic battles, space marines and intense warfare on a planetary scale. Guess I have to look elsewhere."
2,Bleary Eyed.,I&#65533;ve read most 40k books and this one did not get me. I felt that the author&#65533;s ideas and plots were to complicated. He got lost and tried to tie it all together to late. Truly an exploration in the realm of chaos. That aside this characters were believable. Had that junk trader feel.
4,WH40K Fiction at its best,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was surprised by this fact. I'm new to the Warhammer 40,000 hobby and thought this book would be a great way to quickly absorb some of the game world's back story. What I didn't expect was a top shelf sci-fi adventure novel as good as any I've read -- AND I learned a lot about the world of the 41st. century. I'd recommend this book to every 40K player, but also to anyone who's a fan of good adventure fiction. You don't need to play the game to ""get it."""
2,Who's Not Hot?,"If Harry Poe's fictious magazine was rating Sherwood Kirary's book Who's Hot/Who's Not, it regretably would put it in the ""Who's Not"" section. Unlike Kirarly's earlier novel Diminished Capacity,one of the funniest things I've read in years, which is full of wonderfully eccentric charactors, or his next work, Big Babies, which is filled with a lot of irony, there's just not anything to sink the readers's teeth into. Most of the charactors are not worth giving a damn about and the rest of the book is flimsy. Given that his first work, California Rush, was no great masterpiece, the question is, did Kiraly have only one truly funny book in him or will his next work put him back into the pages of ""Who's Hot?"""
5,A Hidden Treasure,"Honest to god, this is one of the best CD's ever. I feel so lucky I found it. I gave it to my dad, who's from the south. He loves it. Everyone who hears it inquires about it. Music and vocals are just superb. Much better that ""Oh Brother"". Just not as popular, because no one seems to have seen the movie. The CD definitely stands on its own, and you don't need to be familiar with the story of the bell witch to enjoy this CD."
1,BEWARE - incentivized reviews!,"I purchased this watch for myself on a lightning deal last year. I got a nice price for a very nice watch -- or so I thought.The watch came with a review incentive on a slip of paper included in the box -- a $10 gift for an amazon review within 20 days of purchasing. If I'd left my review within the 20 day period I'd probably have left a pretty positive review. The watch was attractive, and I loved watching the exposed works in action.However, after a few months of careful daily wear the rose gold color wore away on the bezel exposing the stainless steel base metal. I was so disgusted that I gave it to my 10 year old daughter. I'll never buy Stuhrling again."
1,watch is lovely but suck!!,"I bought this watch last May, and was very careful when wearing it. One day for no reason the watch just stopped while it was still on my wrist. I wore the watch almost everyday, and never dropped it or damaged it in anyway. Is it my luck or the watch just plainly sucks?"
4,Makes a great gift.,"I got this watch for my girlfriend as a birthday present and she loved it. Getting her to wear a watch is no small feat and she still wears it everyday. The watch itself is beautiful and being able to see all of the gears inside is pretty cool. Since the face is shaped like a heart, the ticking insides make it look like a heartbeat, very steampunk. I would have given the watch a full 5 stars but I was personally a bit disappointed with the strap which is simple IS leather but it does not look like leather."
1,Not a presentable watch,"From the advert, this watch looks beautiful. However, you will not be able to tell the time if you did not look at closely. What a waste for such an exquisite watch! The maker should have looked into this direction to rectify the fault. My regret."
3,Nice watch but difficult to read,The dial is darker then the pictures indicated and it has dark hands. I returned it because it was to difficult to read.
4,Beautiful watch,"I love this watch, it's just gorgeous. Mine came with 3 different bands, which makes it easy to match different outfits. The watch itself is amazing but the bands are not as durable as I expected. I've fixed minor tears with superglue and they've been fine. I still love the watch, I've gotten so many compliments on it and it's truly a pleasure to wear."
1,One star minus one,"Don't be fooled by the other two positive reviews...they're mistakes, reviews for a much older DL book called Genesis Echo, written by the late Laurence James.Skydark Spawn is written by Edo Von Belkom, a horror writer. Judging by this book which is a true horror, he is that.This is one of the worst novels in the DL series and that's saying something. It's poorly written, the characters are ciphers and it showcases the author's fascination with bondage and sadomachistic sex over and above anything else.I gave this book only one star because I couldn't give it anything lower. With this book, the DL series has bottomed out."
1,Pretty vile stuff,"I am not a fan of DL in the first place but I have read some books in this interminable series that I actually enjoyed.Skydark Spawn is not of them. It exemplies everything that I find repugnant in the series...stupid heroes, mindless bimbo female characters, a string of cliches' instead of plot, gratuitous violence and a fixation on bottom of the barrel..This one seems to be more of a peephole into the writer's psyche in regards to how he views women rather than a book.Although Skydark Spawn has ""Science Fiction"" printed on the spine, it was more like a soft-core novel aimed at teenage boys. There were no science fiction elements that I could see.A pretty vile book all the way around.After reading this, I told my husband that he'd better switch to reading only Outlanders and stop defiling our home with crud like DL unless he brings it home with the pages processed, perforated and on a roll!"
2,Not so great,"The Stranger isn't really all that great. Nicoletta is totally obsessed with Jetro. So overpowered by love for the beast, she practically forgets everything that used to be important to her. Not a minute can go by without her thinking of her beloved Jetro. Little parts of the book are okay, but most of it is NOT."
2,I think it is a good book,"The book The Stranger by Caroline B. Cooney in my opinion was an alright book. It cought my attention and was easy to read. It talked about how a girl named Nicoletta ahd to deal with not being in the spot light anymore. She was a singer in the choir the Madrigals section , but since a new girl came into the picture Anne Louise Nicolella's life fell apart. Nicoletta lost a special thing , but she found a boy to help get over her loss. I would recomend anybody to read this book it's a good one."
2,Was a strange book!,"The book was titled a thriller, yet there was not thrill. It had a plot that was hard to understand and the main character wasn't realistic. I know that it is fantasy but it didn't go along with the story line. After being attacked by a cave creature that turns out to be the love of her life, and then dealing with her real boyfriend, it was just too confusing. To say something positive, the attraction between Nicoletta and the cave creature was interesting. I think that the only thing that kept my attention was to see if they actually spend the rest of the lives together. That brings me to the end, which was definatly different than what I expected. Maybe that was a good thing, but I wanted it to be different. I think that the author wanted a younger audience to read her book because for anyone else it is on a higher level. All in all, I say that The Stranger, was definatly a strange book!"
1,A painful experience,"I have a mad love of YA horror, particularly Stine, Klause, Hahn, and Coville (read Eyes of the Tarot and Waiting Spirits - they're brilliant examples of the genre). I also loved the first two books in the Face on the Milk Carton series by Cooney.But.This is hands down one of the worst five books I've ever read. Everything about it is bad. It oozed badness. It seeped baditude. Poorly written, poorly plotted, massively poor characterization - every character is a piece of cardboard, and by the last painful turn of the page I was begging for an icepick through the eye. Awful. Just awful.Please, Ms. Cooney, PLEASE...stick to writing about Janie."
3,Beauty and the Beast,"Most writers would not have the courage to believe a monster-in-a-cave story would be OK to write, after you are 8 years old!!But Cooney did it.As usual, she is unique and strange and imaginative.Perhaps a spin on Beauty and the Beast, a beautiful young girl falls in love with a...well, a monster in a cave!!Oddly readable!!"
4,IT's good,"Well, Ken finds out his dad has a girlfriend. Who seems pretty cool to me. So he's dealing with his dad dating and stuff. Conner and liz are basically agruing the whole book because Liz has to work alot and Everytime they do see each other it's with other people and he wonts to be alone with her. Jess askes Evan out. They have an ok time. Jeremy ask Jess to an award show. She agrees as friends. Evan gets jealous and they agrue. Becasue he was going to ask her to there with him. They end up...."
4,Weird...,look i like this book Jess was my favorite character always! but she used to be able to get over everything and anyone and personally i would like to see jeffrey french come back. You remember him right? Well all the diehard fans do. He used to date liz but jess had a monster crush on him and they even kissed behind liz's back. But i want him to come back and be with jess but that probably wont happen so jeremy should dump jade and stick with jess. Plus evan always went better with liz. Didnt he have a crush on her in the beginning? I want to see jess get in a rumble with melissa and have lila finally stick up for her best friend and not follow the crowd. It just isnt the same without her and jess plotting to steal people's boyfriends. I realize that this has nothing to do with this book but i think everyone should know!
4,NO WILL?,"OK, I know that Will is a total pig. He let Jessica's life become trashed all for his crazy girlfriend who should be put in front of a firing squad. But I think that after all the hard work that Jessica put into getting Will, she should at least have been able to continue seeing him instead of grungy, hug-the-trees Evan. I think she deserves someone better than Evan, and even though Will is a jerk I think he and Jessica compliment each other perfectly as a couple.."
5,RAGE is great! Reminiscent of War of the Gargantuas!,"A great movie that mixes sci-fi, horror and action! I have had the privilege to see it twice (once at a film festival and now on home video). Kevin Lindenmuth serves up a delightful mix of werewolves, vampires and mutants. The moon's orbit has been altered closer to earth and the dormant werewolf gene runs rampant! While you won't find your high-budget special effects extravaganza here, you will find creative ingenuity, a great story and a dose of FX that satisfies the beast within. If that's not enough to wet your appetite, watch it to check out Debbie Rochon with fangs (her first vampire role)!! Excellent! See Sasha Graham howl at the moon in wolf form!! Not to miss! Great performances by Santo Marotta, Joe Zaso and Tom Nondorf wrap this up as a must have for your b-movie collection!!"
1,COMPLETELY awful,"I love ""B"" movies and will defend them to the end. THIS is the worst movie i have ever watched in my life, i am not meaning to bash the efforts of the ppl involved in the creation of this movie But it's just utter S***. The camera quality was awful, the sound was awful... the entire thing was ultimately a complete waste of 1 hour and 30 minutes of my life... i will never get those back, please do not make the same mistakes i made in renting this movie.... if you value the time you have on this earth DO NOT waste it on this movie!!!!! i usually say ""Enjoy the movie"" but by all that is right and proper with the universe DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!-Sherwoka"
2,It' was a disapointment,"The plot was good, but they could have made the customs a little better and made the werewolves a little more scarier. I'm use to seeing werewolves like in silver bullet and howling films. If they would have used a better camera this movie would have been good. I'm a big werewolf fan and i'm upset about this film."
4,Ambitious RAGE keeps the viewer guessing,"RAGE OF THE WEREWOLF is an ambitious and apocalyptic sci-fi horror picture in which werewolves become commonplace due to a shifting in the alignment between the Earth and the Moon. Two rival brothers, both werewolves from before the planetary shift, face off in a world now full of their own kind. There is plenty of action and the plot is never predictable. RAGE OF THE WEREWOLF is one of the most unusual and ambitious werewolf tales ever put on the screen."
1,"""There is no escape.....from the pain this movie inflicts""","I have never seen as bad a movie as this one. The best thing that describes it is ""Ahhhhh! My eyes! It burns! It burns!"" This movie is worse than the ""Werewolf"" movie that MST3K ripped on. Apparently, the ""director"" (yeah right) thinks the best way to make a werewolf movie is to borrow someone's vid cam, buy out all the werewolf masks and gorilla suits in New York City, and film everything in his parents' house basement. The story is pathetic, the ""acting"" is laughable, and the movie isn't worth the tape it's been copied to."
4,In the manner of the late Don Whillans.,A very funny account of the Burgess brothers misadventures. A must for anyone who has ever climbed a mountain or raised a little hell.
5,Fantastic Tales!!,"As I read this book, I couldn't help feeling that I was hearing these stories in person at a pub over a pint or two or three. That these two brothers have managed to carve out (sometimes literally!) a grat life from their working class origins is inspirational. My main sport is running, but I have done some climbing and much hiking and really appreciate these professionals and how even in advancing years, they kept trying to stretch their own envelope. I also really enjoyed reading how they learned so much from the Sherpas and the people in Nepal and Tibet. I live at the base of a small mountain (4,000 feet) and love to spend my days there. To be able to live a life among mountains of 24,000 is amazing to me!! I have to place this book in my top 10. Way to go Lads!!!!"
3,"Quirkily cute, but not all that awesome.","Too many of the puzzles baffled me. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get them. Loved Humpty-Dumpty's chapter though, the one with the paradoxes, that was really interesting and didn't involve flipping from the page to the back to the solution and then back. >.<I wish this book was written in more of a story format than this, with the answers cleverly woven in instead of just in the back. Wouldn't this be great if it had more plot? =P"
4,Good CD from a Local Band,"My boyfriend and I heard the song Nebraska on the radio while driving through Chicago a few months back. We made everyone in the car stop talking so we could hear who the band was and we were hooked. Nice harmonies, good instrumentals and an interesting mix of styles."
1,"More ""Harlequinn Romance"" than mystery: Lame","Warning! This book is a romance novel. All the quotes on the cover about how great it is are from romance novel publishers. I was looking for a new mystery/suspense type book, and while I enjoy a good romantic story thrown in there, this book is WAY more about the""simmering tensions"" between the 2 characters than the mystery. It got old real fast for me, and the romance was pretty predictable too.If you usually read Harlequinn romance supermarket books, this is a well written book within that genre. If you, like me, avoid ""bodice-ripper"" romance books at all cost, avoid this one too."
2,Schenker can do better.,"I was really dissapointed in this album.""Anytime"" is a great song,but the rest of the album pretty much stinks.As far as production quality,it sounds good,but the songs just seem kind of limp,and fail to evoke any kind of emotion.Also,Robin McAuley is a decent singer,but most of his lyrics seem a bit sophmoric.Put it this way,he's no Phil Mogg.If you want to hear some great Michael Schenker stuff,buy Essential UFO,or UFO's Strangers in the Night."
3,Easy to use but cord a little short,Actually this is the first MP3 player I have owned and it seems to work fairly well. I download music from my laptop to the drive and saved about 30 songs and it still hasn't used up all the memory. I mainly will be using it during workouts since the music at the local gym is terrible. Probably the only real negative about it is the earpieces it comes with do not seem to be all that comfortable and the length of the cord could stand to be a little longer. I will probably end up buying some other ear pieces. It also works well in the car with a cassette adapter.
3,Adequate MP3 Player perfect for young kid,"I bought this player for my 7 year old because I wanted a player that didn't cost too much so I wouldn't feel too bad about if/when it got lost or broken. As 7 year olds aren't the best at taking care of things.One caveat is that many songs off newer cd's or purchased online are in the mp4 format. This player won't play them unless they are converted to the MP3 format. However, Apples iTunes can convert them to MP3, but if you use a different software on your computer you should make sure it can do this.The player holds about 30 songs, which is fine for a young child's attention span but if I were buying this for an adult or teen I would buy a larger capacity (<512mb) player.It doesn't have the ""coolness"" of an ipod but it's a third of the price, so it's a good value for what I wanted."
5,"easy to use, holds enough music for a workout!!!","If you are a person who goes to the gym for an hour a day, then this is the MP3 player for you. Small, compact, very simple and easy to operate, and gets you around 2 hours of music so you can keep a beat while working up a sweat.Advantages: Small (size of a pen/flash drive)Sound good, adequate volumeCheap!!!! Got mine for under 15 bucksDrop and drag/and go.Can be used as a jump drive for music/filesDisadvantages: No song title/previewNo Fast ForwardOnly plays MP3 format, some WMA files, not that bad ifyou are used to Ipod ownership (which has been touchy for me)You should not pay more than 15-20 bucks for this, and in some places, this comes with a small set of 2 watt stereo speakers for $20, awsome deal. Get this use this, abuse it. This is my second little unit I have bought, my wife stole my other one cause she likes it so much. Good value"
3,pleasantly surprised-so far,I picked up this very cheap mp3 player and was pleasantly surprised. Easy to set up and use with decent sound quality if you encode your music at a fairly high bitrate (192 or higher). Only 128 megs of storage but enough space for an album or two. Controls take a little getting use to but great for the price. Only had it for one day so we will see...
4,Great Little player for the price,"The Mp3 player is great; easy to use, and good sound quality. The product description is very accurate. One con is the memory; there isn't much memory to store lots of music, it holds about 30 songs depending on file size. This item is great for file storage, and the price is just right."
1,Proper instructions would have been nice,"This item had a very good price and my expectations were based on what information I read about it, but on receiving the item and attempting to use it, I found the instructions were not at all helpful. I was unable to make it work. So it sits in a drawer for now. I feel my money was wasted on this item..not because the item was not a good piece of technology, but because I did not recieve instructions on it's use that made sense."
4,Good for the money`,This is just what I need to take with me during my workout. It holds just enough music to get me going. When you want to change your songs its easy to do.
3,Good product but..,"Don't buy it on Amazon, I have received the worst service online from them, they lost my purchases and then take too much time to get the replacement."
1,Not Functional,"The player did not work out of the box. Just appears as an unknow device. After changing my BIOS settings to support USB 2.0, it still did not work, even when a USB 2.0 flash drive did. In all fairness, I have not tried to return it or have it replaced yet."
2,somewhat disappointing...,"It was made in Portugal. The color was somwhat disappointing...but, the price is not bad."
3,"Eh, so so","I am in love with Jude Deveraux's books! This one was just ok for me.. Maybe even less.. I probably wouldn't read it again. I just felt that Zared was too much of a tom boy. Some of the things the hero would say about how Lady Anne was sooo much more beautiful but there's something about Zared that he wants.. He called her underdeveloped at a point.. Then Zared would not shut up about the family feud.. There were points in the book where Jude could have left some of that out, it kind of annoyed me.I am reading The Taming now, so maybe I'll feel differently after reading that book.."
4,Pretty good...,"I reaally liked this book. It wasn't the best romance ever, but I really liked both Zared and Tearle. They were both very unusual characters for a romance novel. I wish that Severn and Anne would've had their own book too! It was nice to see the feud from the first book finally end."
3,Phew!,"I just finished this book, and I don't know what to think. This book just did not work for me. I loved the first book in this series, The Taming, so this book was a little disappointing. There was no real chemistry between the hero and heroine. Zared was too tomboyish, and Tearle was lacking a backbone. Not a keeper on my shelf."
5,excellent,This is just one of the best historical romances I've ever read. This happens to be my no. 1 favorite book by Jude Deveraux. Exceptionally written from the beginning to the end.
5,A great continuation of the Taming!,"This was an excellent novel! After I had read the Taming, I wanted to read more. Well, I was lucky to find that Jude Devereaux made a continuation to the Peregrine saga. Zared was an interesting character, right after my own heart. She was young and beautiful but still a foolish Peregrine, much like Rogan was in the Taming. ...."
4,Yes!!! That is the one!,"I got his novel as a gift from my fiancee, and although it was not as ""breath taking"" as A Knight in Shining Armor, it is one of the best novels I read. Jude, you are my favorite author, thank you. Hend."
1,"if you like to read about hatred, this book is for you","I don't like this book because all our heroine (Zared) and her family knows is hatred, nothing else. And seems like the author thinks that hatred is their privilege. They care about their pride, OK, but would not care a bit of others pride. They don't have a bit gratefulness, they don't have a bit love. They are really selfish people only care about themselves. Look at how Zared treated Tearle, and how her brother treated Lady Anne. I don't like the idea that Tearle has to sacrifice everything to get to Zared. To me, Tearle deserves anyone better than Zared."
5,great romance,"I absolutly love this book. I started reading one night and stayed up till 2 in the morning reading and finished the next day. it usually takes me a couple of days to read a book this long. Usually it takes awhile for me to get into a book, but i got into this book after the first chapter. I agree, Zared was a little annoying how it took her so long to trust Tearle, but i also liked how they didn't immediatly fall in love it made you want to keep reading. By the middle of the book you will wonder if these two will ever get together because Zared still hates him so much. Anyway its a great romance book to lose yourself in."
2,This is not a piano book,"I queried piano music for kids. This is really just a BABY BOOK with 2 words per page that happens to be only the words for one single song and the only sheet music is for that SINGLE SONG on the very LAST page. NOT for kids learning to play piano, but really just a sing-a-long book for babies. Seems like a lot of money for just one song even so! I was expecting several John Denver songs in piano sheet music with pictures intertwined after reading the descprition and it was nothing like that."
5,"Take Me Home, Country Roads","Have purchased a copy for self & others for gifts.. So, we must like it alot!"
5,Perfect Gift,We had a family reunion in West Virginia and this was the perfect gift to give the families that had children! Colorful pictures and a great song!
3,really simplistic,"Nothing on routers,switches,broadband. Although the ccopyrightis 2001, this book could have been written 10 years ago.HOWEVER, if all you have is a dial-up modem, this book will help you."
5,Great Stuff!,I take a medication that causes constipation. I started taking this product 2 years ago. I do not have to use the recommended dosage. I only take one a day and it keeps me more regular than I've been my whole life!
1,"Not a Review, Just a Comment on the Cover Art","I haven't read this book yet (but do own it), but am laughing at the cover-art: it's a painting of Gen. John Breckenridge (by John Paul Strain, I think) leading his Kentucky Orphan Brigade across Stones River at the Battle of Murfreesboro. Big thing is, this was with the Army of Tennessee, not the Army of Northern Virginia! How does this happen?"
1,What's Up With This?,The GREEN Woodstock TWIN-GORE shown as being for sale IS NOT what comes on the screen when you click on it. A different Woodstock rubber shoe - navy blue with yellow trim AND LOW BACK is what appears. Navy item doesn't have gores. It's not the same item!!
2,Just barely...,"I bought those speakers for my computer about 9 months ago, and although they can play music and games, the bass is awful and produces a big hum in the speakers. Don't think they have enough range for it. When there's no ""bassy"" part in the music or sound effects, the sound is ok. So I'd say buy them if you really don't have much money to spend but if you do have a couple of bucks more, go for 2.1 speakers with a sub woofer."
1,Poor quality,"I haven't previously owned a trainer, and all I was hoping for was something relatively quiet and smooth. It showed up and the handles were all shattered (they are pretty cheap plastic). In addition, the casing around the mechanism was broken, allowing the magnet to spin freely around. Trying to look past that I deided to set my bike up to see how it ran, and how noisy it was. After getting most everything back into place that I could the noise was fine for about 20 minutes, and setup was relatively easy, but after 20 minutes it started making a ringing noise that is apparently the metal wheel rubbing against the magnet. If it wasn't broken maybe it would be a good product, but I am pretty disappointed, and I would look elsewhere if you want to spend this much money."
3,Good trainer and value...if you don't mind the noise,"I recenly purchased this trainer for 119.99 through amazon and I was happy with it...except for the noise. It's not incredibly loud but it's loud enough so that if you want to watch TV while riding you have to put the volume up pretty loud. That bothered me so I returned it and got a fluid trainer and it was much quieter. Some nice things about the blackburn mag trainer was that it came assembled right out of the box, resistance was smooth, it fit a large variety of wheels, and mounting the bike onto the trainer was easy. The negatives were the noise and also it seemed to wear out the tire quite a bit. If you do purchase this trainer you might want to purchase a cheap tire to put on your bike while you use it."
4,"It's good, but not great","This does what it's meant to do. It sets up easily, but it is noisy. I used it for the first time last night, and had to turn my tv volume up very high.Like I said, it works and does what it is supposed to do."
4,this is good,"I just got one of these. I have an older mountain bike I was not using, set it up within 10 minutes, no tools required, no taking apart of my bike required (you will need air in your back tire!). The only other regular exercise I get is 30 minutes of walking, so I needed something different to do...this will definitely do the trick, my bike now has a purpose and I am getting a different type of exercise. It is quieter than our older nordictrak, quieter than the treadmill we used to have, so if you are used to that type of exercise equipment, the sound will not bother you. Put on your headphones and don't worry about getting hit by a car!"
4,Not a bad trainer at all.,"This is my first trainer, so I have no experience with any other.That being said, it works great for me. To help with the noise problem, I went and bought a VERY smooth rear tire, and set the trainer on a thin rubber mat. No unrealistic noise that shouldnt be expected from riding a bike inside a house. I could pop in and watch a movie while using it.Wanna be cheap? Throw an old phone book under the front wheel to balance/level the bike.The only gripe I have is the initial mounting of the bike. Finding the right way/angle to secure the skewer caused me to almost launch off the thing more than once.(Hint: Secure skewer pointing BACK before mounting.)Other than difficult mounting of bike, it's a good product. You're gonna work though, so no 'cruising'. If you tire, use a lower gear, and keep spinning!"
3,not for sweaty feet,"These make my feet sweat and the inside (black) rubs off on your foot. I recommend wearing with socks, will still bleed a little so dark socks. I actually got a foot fungus and I think it was from these shoes. Very dissapointed because I love the comfort and the style, great shoe for work and they are hard to come by. So if your not a sweater than I completely recommend these and get more than one!"
3,not for my feet!,"These shoes were not very comfortable at all. A lot of rough edges and what looked to me like shoddy workmanship, contributed to a painful walking experience ;-0 I would never attempt to waer these without socks."
5,wonderful,the item arrived quickly and was beautiful. the photo does not do it justice. it is a wonderful pendant.
5,Lovely statue,I have had this statue for two years and love it. It adds so much to my yard surrounded by flowers. The angel has a sweet face and the height is just the right size for my garden. I would highly recommend it and am going to order one for my friends who just bought a house in Indy.
3,Is what it is,Very light weight and kind of flimsy. I guess it is ok but expected something sturdier. It will work for now in the clinic.
5,This is a regulation Snellen Eye Chart,"This Snellen Eye Chart is the same one used in doctors' offices. It's great if you have a room that has a straight line of sight 20-feet long and you want to check your vision at home if you have a chronic eye condition, such as a repaired retinal detachment, Macular Degeneration, etc."
5,Fantastic!,Another Dietrich triumph. Do not listen to other reviews that say this is bad. Or for that matter Dietrich herself. This is a wonderful concert. Do not be misguided. If your a true Dietrich fan you'll love it. It's one of those that gets better and better. I've watched it several times. The price held me back along time but it really is worth it to see a real pro at work.
3,Too institutionalized.,"Disappointed. Another review by a major brokerage employee trying to drum up business. I do not care about the history of the investing world or how the good old boys operate on the floors of the major exchanges. They are irrelevant to the littleguy at home who wants to know HOW, not WHAT. Short on specifics, long on ""Boy, do I know a lot that you will never know, but if you try really hard and have the perspicacity of a saint and minimize your losses and maximize your gains, you will maybe do ok"". Give me a break! Save your money and time!"
5,Gonzalager Quallude' definitely puts this San Francisco quartet,"""Channel 23"" into their own league. We're talking skills! This band can play, (the drummer is making meat-by-products on his kit quicker than any Wolfgang Puck, the horn player has got breath!) and sing and write unique, worldly pop-music. When we listen to it, we think of a rather steamy amphitheatre in San Paulo, Brazil dancing and sweating to this very dynamic and expressive band all night long. This band should be on tour with Dave Matthews, Mana, or 311-because they cook!"
2,My feelings about this CD -- Ehh.,After reading the rave reviews I bought this CD. After trying to listening to it several times all I could think of was the comments were made by the family members of the band or the band.There is nothing new nor inovating about this disc. I have heard it all before.Next time I will take the reviews with a grain of salt.Save your money.
5,A must have for Ovation owners,"Walter Carter is one of the finest writers of guitar history today. This book is a fine tribute to an innovative and customer-oriented company. Ovation is often overlooked in the guitar community because they are different in their design. They have always, and continue to, produce high quality instruments for the beginner and the professional player. After reading the history of Charlie Kaman and the dedication to building the best instruments in a non-traditional way, I hope that many guitarists take a second look at a great product. Different isn't always bad....and the reasons for Ovation's use of materials and design proves it."
3,Hardcover - Brief - Gag Book,"I purchased this book even though some reviews warned of the ""value"". I wasn't WOW'd either but purchased it ""used"". Mildly amusing and not a keeper. Not much to it--especially for big Elvis fans."
1,This is a joke book.,"I ordered this book and immediately returned it. The entire book contains fullpage pictures of supposed Elvis sightings. It's apparent they pasted pictures of Elvis into other pictures, showing things like: (picture of Elvis in his early 20's among a crowd of people saying 1995). I really got offended when I received it in the mail, more or less, this book was published to make fun of people who are not sure whether Elvis is dead or not. Trash to a REAL Elvis fan."
2,Disappointing...,"This book was disappointing overall, although I enjoyed much of the dialogue. I found the two main characters pretty sleazy and ended the book thinking both of them were capable of just about anything bad! However, I'll continue to read and enjoy Ms. Kellogg's Kick Keswick series - those are great!"
3,"Hmmm, running out of photos?","I've been buying this calendar now for about 4 years. The first time I bought it the pictures were new to me, of course. And the layout looked very French. But now, it seems it's the same old photos with a more modern layout. Don't get me wrong, the photos are pretty, some cliche. And the months and days are where they should be. But maybe it needs to get a little more gritty and less pretty?"
5,Human Sexuality 102,"Ok, so most people know the basics of sexuality or at least they think they do. Well, this book will expand your mind to the utmost! This fantastic book brings you cutting edge information on human sexuality with 18 chapters loaded with never-before told information. There is a separate section on archetypes, affirmations, and even visualizations to improve your life and that significant other! There is even a section at the back with great articles written by Janet Swerdlow that adds the final touch to it all! What I found most fascinating about it all was the idea that sexuality replicates the original creative force of God-Mind. I can always leave it to the Swerdlow's to have a common-sense and simple, but profound, explanation for physical reality and why things are the way they are. This book is not for Bible-thumpers or the closed minded for sure!"
3,Popular sexuality,"Nothing new here.I personally found the writing stile drawn out and irritating, stating the obvious ""mother to child"" sort of speak....the authors seem to assume you have just discovered sex, but this is only my opinion, you may enjoy the book and get something out of it.For me,it was an effort and a yawn to read it and eventually I gave up. If you are new to sex (magick) you could do worse....I think."
1,The worst in the series,"Out of the several books written by these authors, this one is the worst. At least the Montauk books were entertaining. What little restraint of grandiosity held true for ""Blue Blood, True Blood"" goes out of the window with this badly written, self-indulgent title. Save your money."
4,acoustic jazz guitar runs faster than any rock guitarist,"For a then 13 year old to play with such speed, surety and improvisational ability in jazz is astounding, to play as he does with no musical training gives new meaning to ""jazz prodigy"". A must own CD."
1,Light of the World,"Did not like the ""jazz"" music on this hymn/. Would prefer a religious and harmonious arrangement."
3,just ok,"Just bought this from my local sew-vac dealer for $73. On tile/hard floors, the major advantage is speed of pick-up and it saves the bending-over associated with a dustpan/broom. Picks up larger particles ok (cheerios, crumbs, etc), but the fine dust, sand, and hair is harder to remove. The old broom (with polyester bristles) does a better job on the dust and fine particles. It's a bit more effective on carpet. Good for use between vaccuumings. Although, it didn't pick up the flower petals my kids scattered all over the carpet."
1,Save your money,"We purchased the Orek based on the reviews. All I can say is save your money. A 5.00 pan and broom does a better job, and faster. We have hardwood floors and area carpets, figured it would do the job on at least one of them. It does not do either one very well. If you don't mind going over the same area 5-6 times then you'll love it. I don't have that kind of time to waste."
1,disapointing purchase,"Don't waste your money like I just did. My dog brings in dry leaves after playing in the backyard. I had an ""ah-hah moment"" remembering the Hoky I used as a teenager to pick up popcorn in the lobby of the theater I worked in. This Hoky Restaurateur doesn't work at all like it's predecessor. I chased leaves around the hard and carpeted surfaces until they were crumbled all over the edges of the floor. I got the vacuum out to clean up in two minutes what I had just chased around with my new Hoky for 20 minutes. You might want to advertise this as a piece of exercise equipment."
1,GoVacuum,I too ordered the Oreck Hoky from GoVacuum only to receive the Restrauteur. The dimensions and most of the functionality is the same but definitely a lower end sweeper. I called GoVacuum and they do not even have the 'HOKY' by Oreck so if you order from them you will get the cheaper model. I was offered to ship it back and may do that but I advised the GoVacuum guy he was showing the HOKEY and he should change the offer on Amazon.com as it was deceiving people. Amazon.com needs to follow-up with this company and I would strongly encourage you to not purchase any item from this company.
4,Typical responses from critics,"This book was written the way Tavis speaks, intelligently. A lot of people close their ears and eyes when it comes to hearing the truth about what they can't experience and understand so they'd rather belittle Smiley's point of view and experiences to ""reverse"" racism or tiresome rhetoric. But then nothing more is expected from those who walk through life privileged. Even the most liberal white man could never understand the plight of minorities, let alone conservatives, the party of I-have-mine-screw-you."
1,About like he speaks,"Mr. Smiley seems like a likeable guy, but from what I have seen of him on BET, and other cable shows, he lacks any ability to articulate points using reason or objective facts. Unfortunately, his writing isn't much better. Many whites would consider him somewhat racist. I don't, I actually think he is truly searching for an answer, but his conclusion that the ""right"" is to blame for everything is tiring, particularly now as we hit 2000.Something fresh is in order."
1,Who was this book written for?,"Without exception the worst writing I have ever seen. No facts, no figures, just Tavis' opinions abound, presented as 'quasi-facts'. Pick up a Cornal West book (race matters, etc) for quality 'left-leaning' reading."
1,Don't Bother,"I consider myself a liberal democrat; politically, I am very close to Mr. Smiley. However, the lack of insight or intellectual rigor which he offers with this once-over presents complex views in broad and often incoherent strokes. Mr. Smiley's obvious lack of background on issues as broad as racism or as complex as affirmative action shines through. However, it is amusing in a way to watch the academic equivilant of a toddler playing with an uzi.Thanks, but we don't need a liberal limbaugh."
1,WORSE IN PRINT THAN ON AIRWAVES,"Tavis Smiley is one of the most irritating television personalities I've heard, and he is worse as a writer. He taps into Black America's thirst for knowledge, any kind of knowledge, but unfortunately he doesn't offer much in the way of substance. Someone needs to pull the plug on him, and someone else need to stop printing this drivel. And this isn't random racism -- I'm an AFrican American woman who thinks WE can do better in producing good commentary. Clarence Page and George Curry offer much better insights than Smiley does."
2,not impressed,"After being a fan of every other Fearless book from the first series, I was deeply disappointed in the Fearless FBI series. The beginning was okay, and the climax was eventful, but I was hoping for the same raw, violent, witty, smart, and suspensful plot from the original Fearless books. I loved the past books, and I was let down after reading the new books. I expected Gaia's unique character to stay the way she was, intelligent, disdraught, passionate, unexpected, and best of all, fearless. However, the new books portray her as being more mature and composed while she grows up and goes to Stanford and getting a job with the FBI. I miss the old Gaia who lived for the moment and roamed the streets of New York. I wish that the old characters such as Ed, Sam, and Jake were still in the book series and I think it was depressing that they were all cut out of Gaia's life."
3,"Fairly good info, could be better","This book has a fair amount of information about the car, but lacks quite a bit also. Many things you look for in it you can't even find because they didn't cover the topic. Things like fuse diagrams and simple things like what bulbs are used in the car are not even in the book. Get a Chiltons."
4,"Little known Miller work, but a great story","I just wish this play was produced more often, but I can see why it is challenging to produce with all of the various musical elements. It seems like a great show, however, and would be great for production by an all girls school or a drama company that is heavy on females."
3,"Jilina is a wonderful teacher,","She is one of the best teachers/performers IMO. This DVD, however, is good but not great. I felt a little bored in all three in the set. I'm not sure how comfortable J was, or maybe it's just me. I love her Drum Solo dvd and her Egyptian pop chorgy."
2,uhhh,"what drives me CRAZY about this is that the camera angle will change from behind jillina (dance class style) to a medium shot from the front that doesnt even show her hip or footwork! or even worse, a closeup. as a long time dancer and video editor, this is maddening! youll be learning a specific move and right in the middle of it the angle is flipped and cut off, how the hell am i supposed to follow this? she also doesnt give any insight as how to achieve the correct style/muscle work as real dance instructors do, and she is a BAD DANCER. sorry but its true."
2,Not a great exemple of a oriental Dancer.,"As a professional Instructor, choreographer and Dancer, I saw many, many GREAT dancers through the years, and Jillina it's NOT a oriental Dancer, her dance is stiff, and doesn't inspire me at all.You can do it better simple listening a song and putting steps together.Jillina is a pure example that money can buy many thingS but will not make you a dancer if you are not one from the heart.Her knee shimmy it's a shame!!! And she doesn't flow like a Belly Dancer should, also her dance is cold and dry like her.There many other things out of the Hollywood style Super Starts, just look for Middle Eastern Dancers, sometimes the cultural shock is big, but makes you learn better about all other things.Buy Norhan Sharif, or better buy the Egytpian Dancers videos (Lucy, Fifi, Dina, Farida) and you will get the real thing, not a cheap American imitation of such a beautiful art!!Good luck!"
4,Fun read,"This was a fun book with lots of different facets. Going back to your hometown and seeing your high school crush again, and being rather surprised by how he's changed and you yourself have changed. Her multicultural background and how she dealt with being different while growing up. Lots of funny moments, and the book was so entertaining, it was read very quickly."
1,couldn't make it past the second chapter,"This chick lit book is geared for the younger 20-something. If you're not in the age category, don't bother."
3,Good but ...,I purchased the belt to support my back. I'm 7 month pregnant and this is my second child. I had back pain from 5th month. I would say it works more like a sling and keeps my child in place(I had a big tummy because it is the second). It might help my back a little but not very noticable. Plus it's not very comfortable to use in summer.
5,great product,this really helped with muscle strain while I was pregnant with my daughter. It was nice to find one of these available in a size that was comfortable to wear during the final weeks of pregnancy - impossible to do in local stores.
5,A brutal gore second released album...,"Gorerotted had an great debut but their next release was even better... If you want everything from gore lirycs, to sick art, in other words just plain disturbing ? Then gorerotted's ""only tool & corpses"" is the choise for you. Higly recommended!"
5,Gore metal at its finest...,"For all exhumed fans and lovers out there? Look no further then gorerotted's ""only tools and corpses"" truly an amazing work and pure evil and brutal as well. Highly recommended"
4,Their music is spychotic but in a fun way...,"If your a fan of deathmetal and grind you must know when bands are trying to be funny or sirious...Well, gorerotted sure is not trying to be sirious at all. Only tools and corpses is the album that i wasn't realy into gorerotted but mutilated in minutes is a much stronger album by this guys without a doubt! The best song here to me is hacksore...Worth it!"
5,Excellent resource for concerned parents,"Our oldest child has his learner's permit, so this is a first for us. We required him to read Mr. Berardelli's book before we took him to test for the learner's permit and we are using it as a blueprint in teaching him to drive. It is very well organized and reminds us to cover small details we might otherwise overlook. We especially like the 100-hour log. Our state only requires 40 hours with a parent while behind the wheel, but we've made it clear we'll be requiring Mr. Berardelli's 100 hours before a license can be obtained. Our metropolitan area lost more than 20 teens last year in traffic accidents, including one from our son's school and the wreck happened right down the street from us at 5:30pm, with no drugs or alcohol involved. Last year's teen record in our area was frightening. This book just gives good, sound advice about preparing a teen to drive."
4,This is a helpful little book,"(...)I could have used Mr. Berardelli's text a few years ago.Now, I have the book wrapped up and ready when my two speed demon grandsons hit the magic driving age.I agree also with Berardelli's comments about professional driver training being essentially inadequate. Bob Bondurant or Skip Barber training is expensive but worth it. The High School Driver Ed guy is not up to the task."
2,A few pointers in a haystack of filler,"I like the attractive cover and spiral binding, but the content of the book, like cotton candy, melts down to little substance. To pick an example: there are three (3) vacuous paragraphs just on cleaning the windshield, with a canonical list of substances that can dirty the windshield and platitudes like ""It doesn't take long before the glass becomes dirty. So it is a good idea, *every* time you start out..."" --It's just filler and it's tiresome to read. The book is also poorly written in other ways and needs a good basic editing, the type a grade school English teacher could do.Give another driver's education book a chance; they're all written for teens anyway. My teen and I quickly abandoned this book and practice the Smith System instead. If I were to buy another book I'd try one the time-tested offerings from the well-respected AAA, such as theirAAA Teaching Your Teens to Drive (Book/Video Kit)."

5,What do they mean?,"TMBG (a.k.a. they might be giants) are a great band and took a chance with an instrumental song (without words) and the CD is not a ""singing cd"" as some here have called it, it is simply a cd for revivals of artists' favorite songs. TMBG did a great job on this CD, and was not designed for preteen kids who don't like instrumental music yet. as for raven and hilary, kudos to the editors! seriously, they made the actresses sound great."
4,Disneymania.....very cool.,"It's a great cd! Yes indeed it is.#1 Welcome. Jump5: This is a wonderful song from a disney movie called Brother bear. The chorus is great and brandon and chris sing alot more on the verses than any other time before! They sound a lot better than they used to! And don't forget the rest of the awesome christian group, libby (who is sadly leaving i believe this was her last song) lesly, and brittany!#2: True to your heart. Raven. This is from the great movie Mulon. This song is overall amazing. Raven has such a strong voice, and has a very good voice as well. I love everything about this song.#3: It's a small world. Baha men: This is just one of disney's songs, and i really think that this is a really good song, and heh they are great singers. (Who let the dogs out who who who who)there are many other great songs on this cd i suggest you get it. It's definatly worth it!"
1,Dreadful and pandering,"When I was a kid, I was a big fan of the old, classic Disney movies. But hearing this, I can only ask, what happened? How can Disney produce such crap? The answer, of course, is simple. It's all about making money.How else to explain this collection of horrid, shrill recordings?What we have here is the worst sort of pandering by one of the most soulless corporations now in existence. Each and every ""song"" here is an example of rote, by-the-number calculation, designed to appeal to what the Disney people must assume are idiotic SUV-driving parents and their overindulged little monsters, in other words, to people who cannot distinguish between quantity/popularity and quality. That's not necessarily what the purchasers of this product are, but rather, how those who produce this product see you. Why give in to them?"
3,Here's who's performing,"Since Amazon isn't listing the performing artists on this CD, here's the list, straight from the Disney site.Welcome by Jump5True to Your Heart by RavenIts a Small World by Baha MenHes a Tramp by The Beu SistersZip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah by Stevie BrockSiamese Cat Song by Hilary Duff & Haylie DuffCircle of Life by Disney Channel Circle of StarsA Whole New World by LMNTOnce Upon Another Dream by no secretsAnytime You Need a Friend by The Beu SistersThe Second Star to the Right by Jesse McCartneyWhen You Wish Upon a Star by Ashley GearingA Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes by Daniel BedingfieldBaroque Hoedown (as heard in Disneys Main Street Electrical Parade) by They Might Be GiantsSo if you are a TMBG completist (or the parent of a Hilary Duff fanatic), here's one more album you'll have to get..."
4,Some Great songs,"I listened to this CD. I like most of the songs, the song that stuck out most to me was 2nd Star to the Right. Jesse McCartney did a wonderful job singing it, its my favorite track on the cd."
1,Disappointment,Most disappointed in this album as it is NOT the Original Platters and there is no mention in the description or on the CD that it is not the original group.
1,..,"What a disappointment!! Got this CD as a gift and couldn't wait to listen to it as the Platters are one of my favorite groups. Much to my surprise and disappointment the songs on this cd are not by the original Platters nor even by the group that is now called the Platters. No where on the cd does it say the songs are done by someone else. When buying cds such as this, make sure it says ""ORIGINAL RECORDINGS"". They are not even a good imitation, the singing is horrible!! Don't even consider buying this cd."
2,A Good Idea Botched,"After a very good start Neon Maniacs seems to just fall apart and it gets so boring that by the end of it you begin to wonder if this is still the same film.The 2 stars is for the opening scene with the kids in the park, the rest of the film is just plain silly."
3,"""THEY LIVE... SO OTHERS MAY DIE!""","Entertaining and above average 80's effort starring 12 so-called ""Neon Maniacs,"" and zero plot. That being said, there is enough here to keep you interested for 90 minutes or so. You have the music and style of the 80's to cringe and laugh at, you also get the maniacs themselves which carry oh so original names such as, AX (he carries an ax), DOC (he's an evil doctor), ARCHER (ugh... you get it!), and so forth. The film moves along quickly and by the end you know exactly the same amount about the maniacs as when it started... yep, they're ugly and mean(you do get to know how to defeat them) and kill, well; because they are the bad guys of course! Don't ask so many questions already! Just put your brain on cruise control and enjoy the show... oh, and be prepared to laugh and shake your head. By the way, this movie reminded me alot of CHUD(which is WAY better) so if you've seen that and thought it was unwatchable then don't waste your time here."
5,80s Horror prime baby!,Awesome flickconsidered in the so bad it's good category hahabut i love this movie 80s horror is always a good time and that's what i look for in a movie is some fun!defiantly worth the buy!!!
1,Not a soap mold,"This is a flimsy piece of clear plastic more or less identical to the bubble pack on many retail products. Worse, the mold depth is far too little to allow molding an actual bar of soap. It's also doubtful that the plastic would withstand the temperature of melted soap.With shipping it's about $7.50! Save your money."
4,Lovely,Well what can i say about this itemwell 1st i love itit shipped fast i got it before the due date by 2 weeksmy soaps came out nicethank you sooooo much
3,used as soap mold,I started making soaps and this was the first mold I used. The soaps come out a little big and somewhat sharp angles but overall not a bad mold for soaps if you like bigger bars.
5,"More Donna Reed, less Shelley Fabares","The Donna Reed Show is my all time favorite family sitcom. I enjoyed season 5 immensely, especially the show with Paul Petersen singing ""My Dad."" Shelley Fabares wasn't in all of the episodes and I missed her. However, all of the actors who play the Stone family are believable, likeable and interesting. Sure, The Donna Reed Show wasn't completely realistic, but isn't that what TV is for? I have seasons 1-5 and I will watch them again."
4,The Donna Reed Show: Season 5,"I liked this season. It is fun to watch the kidsgrow up. I do think that the show it is gettingto be more silly, trying to stay up with the times.I think the first 4 seasons were more serious,teaching moral lessons."
1,Might not happen,"It looks like season 5 and beyond will not come to DVD, it took forever to get season 4 on dvd..."
4,Excellent bedside bread book,"After having been initially inspired to bake bread by Jamie Oliver, I progressed to this book. I have spent many hours digesting the wealth of interest and information in ""Country Breads"", and have had many successes with the recipes, I have actually had many requests to bring bread to work. My only complaint with the book would be that it is a little England-centric. It goes on and on about the Shipton Mill and its flour, and some of this flour is specified in recipes. Shipton Mill is a little far away from Melbourne, Australia! My favourite recipes are: the rye ""Pain de Reucht"", the baguettes made from a 'poolish', and the San Francisco Sourdough. I would certainly recommend the book as it has taught me a great deal, although only as a third or fourth book purchase on bread baking, not as a 'Bread Bible'."
2,Uneasy feelings,Took this product for about a week and wish I hadnt it really did suppress my hunger but made me feel very uneasy and just wired to the point that it made me sick I followed all instructions for this product not saying its a bad productJust my personal experience...
4,Ok,"the product meets specifications, even though I do not see the difference with hydroxycut hardcore X. .. I think it's best ....."
1,Gave me the shakes,"I can't really give an honest review on the ability to lose weight with this product because it gave me the shakes. This surprises me because I drink a non insignificant amount of caffine. Yet when taking two pills as directed in the morning my fingers couldn't stop twitching.I'm a big guy, it really surprised me."
3,Hydoxycut Muscle Tech Hardcore Elite pills,"I got this since I am in the process of losing weight and figured I'd give it a try. First, I realize other people have commented with the same problem (following the regiment on the bottle causes stomach upset). On the first day, you are only required to take one pill. The second day however, you are required to take two (this is when my stomach started hurting). On day three, you are supposed to take two pills twice a day (which I didn't even try). It is like taking mega dose of caffeine or a Vivarin tablet and many people might experience problems like I did. Anytime taking medication like this drink PLENTY OF WATER! I found just taking the one pill a day caused no ill side effects with me but in all honesty I couldn't imagine taking anymore than that for fear of the way it makes me feel (like I wanna puke)."
3,Not For Everyone,"Hydroxycut Elite simply made me feel less than perfect. I followed the instructions, drank lots of water and weaned myself onto the supplement per the instructions but it turned my stomach. I did experience some of the effects that it promises, such as boosted energy (tons of it!) and decreased appetite, but this one simply isn't for me. I kept the faith for about a week, waited to see if the side-effect I was experiencing would go away, but it didn't. I simply stopped taking it."
3,Definately will help you lose weight...,"The key to this product is taking it at least 30mins before workout so your body can absorb it. Once in your system make sure you work out, if you don't work out this is pointless. If you take it and then workout immediately after, it will make you want to vomit and feel jittery. Used this for a while, but I don't think I'd use it again, it's a pill that makes your heart race. It's perfect if you are the insanity workout, it will keep you going for hours!"
3,Definitely warms me up and keeps me moving,"I love my caffeine and typically have no trouble falling asleep regardless of what time of day I have a cup of coffee. I do find that I am sensitive to supplements and many medications, therefore I am always careful when trying anything new. I took one capsule mid morning the first day to see what reaction I would have. I started feeling the effects within about 20 minutes. I felt energized and lively...and hot. I'm normally not a sweaty kind of gal, however when I take this I feel a clammy feeling. I have not increased my dose, but for the past week, I have simply continued to take one capsule each day about 15 minutes before I workout or go running. I've not noticed any additional weight loss, but I do feel more energized and I have more stamina. I'll continue to take this and I'll update this review periodically with my results."
2,extremely over done.,"I'm sure this product works for people that are 275 pounds but me, at 160, its beyond to much. My level of attentiveness is elevated which i like, but when it comes to lifting or doing cardio, i find it hard and nearly impossible to keep my heart rate down to level where such activities are even possible. Tooo much caffein for my body size."
1,Complete Garbage!!!,"I think i gained weight while using this! Followed Directions, felt absolutly nothing, gained 10 lbs. enough said!!! Would not recommend to anyone!"
2,janey,never did seem to work for me but i will not waste my time with it anymore.even tried with a carb blocker and it did not work either.
3,Not something you want...,"I've tried all there is.. This is horrible, worse than DMAA(wtf FDA?), there's energy, just not the kind you want. This is anxiety ridden punch your way through a brick wall raw jittery energy. With that said, do not use as a regular energy supplement. I can't even finish this bottle due to the anxiety and dyslexia this nonsense causes. I'm moving onto something else. Bring back DMAA."
4,"It works, athough the dosage shall be individually adjusted","This stuff works - it makes me sweaty and suppresses appetite. Energy-wise I don't see a huge boost from it because I take one pill once a day before workouts. The reason is that two pills make me jittery like that squirrel from ""Over the hedge"". I agree with other reviewers that the dosage shall be individually adjusted and that the bottle shall clearly state that. As a side note, recently I started taking co-enzyme Q10 and it gives me ""steady"" energy, Hydroxycut hardcore elite complements Q10 as a thermogenic and appetite suppressant."
2,New formula sucks,"I didn't know they stopped using yohimbe, they did, ""new formula"" more like downgraded formula.I like the old formula, I take one pill and it's enough, and the dosage is two, that's the old one.This one is also two pill dosage, so I start with one, nothing, in fact I felt sleepier than before I took it, took the second, no different, 30 minutes later took a 3rd pill and waited, and realized this stuff sucks, maybe it has paprika in it I don't know, but it's garbage.Really disappointed, and I don't recommend such a large bottle of worthless crap."
1,Headaches are the worst!,"I tried taking this product for 2 weeks following exactly the directions printed on the bottle. In addition, I ate sensibly and exercised 4-5x a week and lost not a pound, but I can deal with that. What I couldn't deal with are the side effects. I'd get tremendous headaches and the rise in body temperature made me think that I had a fever. I really thought that I was coming up with a viral infection because it happened every night, but it especially happened when I would take 6 pills a day. It finally hit me that it was these pills that were causing my health to decline.I'm 32, pretty athletic and active; definitely not a faint type of guy. You be the judge. I do not recommend this to anyone!"
4,Hydroxycut Hardcore,"It was shipped within the time frame given. I have lost weight and I noticed that the week when I was sick and couldnt make it to the gym I only lost about 3lbs but in the weeks I worked out I lost on average about 5-8lbs. So I highly recommend working out with this product and of course eating right! Also, when it says dont take it 6 hours before sleeping, DONT! I could not get a good nights rest when I would chance it. Overall, I would recommend the product for anyone who wants to lose weight and put effort into it by working out :)"
3,Thought this was a protein powder,"It says if you have problems with insomnia not to take, so I couldn't take it. I had my workout partner try this & she started by taking one as the directions indicated, then went to two. She backed it back down to one because two made her feel a bit edgy. She said she may continue taking this for a short amount of time because it does give her extra energy for her workouts."
1,"Not worth dying over, no thanks I will pass.","Thanks for the heads up! I will NOT be taking this product, GNC also sent me a sample package ***putting in trash!** I value my life more than losing 5 pounds. I took another pill they sent me that was full of thamin and my heart was jumping from my chest, I threw up and I was shaking and broke out in a rash. Thermogencis are NOT for me. Any suggestion on a pill that will not cause me terrible side affects?"
3,One short!,"Hydroxycut Hardcore Pro Series- [[ASIN:B002LME3IU Muscle Tech - ] 120 LiquiTech Capules]I had not started taking the product yet. My issue is that I was one liquid capsule short. If you think about it, it may not matter much but, I didn't get exactly what I paid for! It could be a problem if every 120 capsule has 119."
1,Crack,I had to stop using it after 1 dose. It made me and my body feel weird and I would rather workout extra hard as go through that again. I would fail a drug test if I took one right now.
1,Sick Girlfriend,"I received a sample from bodybuilding.com. This sample says to take two pills and says nothing about taking one pill the first day to assess your tolerance BUT on the MuscleTech website and the actual product it says start with one. I wish I knew this prior to my girlfriend taking two, because she felt like crap. Her heart was beating rapidly only minutes after taking it, her eyes were bloodshot, and she threw up multiple times. Poor labeling is a serious issue. Good luck trying to contact the company. I still have not found contact information for them."
3,Mixed feelings with this product.,"I've been a long time user of Hydroxycut products before, and I can honestly say you will get results. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, you may be at risk of serious side effects. The first time I took Hydroxycut I had lost 20 lbs in a month. But despite my quick weight loss I had headaches often, maybe twice a week. And my heart would ""flutter"" during times where I'm at rest. The longer I've used the product I kept dropping weight which is great, but I started developing hives around my neck and on my arms. To this day I am still using this product because it DOES work for me, and the side effects are manageable and not yet serious.If you are considering this product, do some research first and look up the risk factors."
3,"mediocre, far from perfect",the side effects are much stronger than in previous versions. It still provides alot of energy and you sweat a lot easier
1,Never Buy Again,I purchased this to help lose the last 20 pounds that I need to lose. I would never buy this again and would not recommend this product to anyone. It is expensive and does not work. It gave me lots of energy but also increased my appetite 10 fold. I did not gain any weight but didn't lose either.
3,On The Fence,"I work out five days a week, have a great nutrition plan, and take a lot of supplements so when I added this in to the mix it's hard to say how much of an impact it really had. One thing I can tell you is I did see positive results."
1,I dont feel a thing...,"Hi guys, I started using this 2 days ago and I took during first day 1 in the morining, half an hour before breakfast in 10AM, didnt feel a thing. Next I took after 5hours in 3PM, and I went to lunch half an hour after. Nothing happend...I was hungry as usual and thats like every 3-4 hours if I eat around 500kcal per meal, and I eat 4-5 times per day with snacks. Around 2000-3000kcal per day. It depends of conditions and what I do during the day. I m 6' 4"" and I weight 225-230 pounds in the morning. Around 25-30 pounds of extra weight, with 200 I m lean muscles. Anyway I didnt feel a thing so I increased to 1 in the morining and 2 around 2PM and same thing...nothing... My female cousin took these and told me they had no effect on her as well :-) I m gonna continue using them and report it over here... I had same experience with one other fat burner 4-5yrs ago but I cant remember name now..."
2,Save Your Money,"I did not manage to lose weight. It made me jittery & I had a hard time sleeping. I prefer Oxyelite Pro. It's more expensive, but at least it works."
2,Gave Hubby the Jitters,"My husband is always looking for ways to get buff, or lose weight, and was willing to give this a try as he knew of the Hydroxycut name. He only took a few, however, as he had a horrible case of the jitters and just ""didn't feel right"". Maybe it works for some people, but I would say that those who are more sensitive to medication, as he is, should avoid it."
2,Not nearly as good as other products,I use a lot of diet supplements and this ranks near the bottom of the list. Never felt like it did any good and made me very nauseous.
3,it's okay,I tried this Hydroxycut Hardcore capsules and didn't think it worked as well as the Hydroxycut fo women tablets. I did experience the crash feeling and didn't like it.
3,worked,this product worked. Not as well as expexcted. but then again i didn't work out as much as i should have . also make sure you diet as well with this
2,Multivitamin?,"Other than a good dose of caffeine, this product contains several amino acids and vitamins that are purported to stimulate metabolism and ""burn"" calories. Other than the caffeine stimulation, I cannot honestly say that I have perceived any difference in that way I feel, hunger level, energy level or weight change. The ingredients are probably helpful but in and of themselves they don't really seem to do anything."
2,Not what is used to be,"I've used Hydroxycut periodically over the years and with the modest results. It was never what it was hyped to be, but it helped control my hunger and I would see an increase in weight loss when I started a cycle, but now...it's nothing more than a caffeine pill. Too bad because it was the last modestly price supplement on the market that actually worked."
1,Didn'5 work at all!!!,"This product was horrible! I never got a rush of any kind at all. I would get really cold for some reason, which is weird considering I am very hot natured. I would get very tired and my muscles weak. On the fourth day I started breaking out with a weird rash. I discontinued the product and within two days all the symptoms dissappeared. I got a lot better results from taking L-Arginine from walmart at $2.96!!! I do not recommend this product at all!"
4,Buen quemador,"Te da mucha mucha energía pero mucha sed, cuando hago ejercicio me tomo 3 litros de agua, no puedo decir si he bajado con este quemador por que llevo usándolo una semana pero tengo mis mejores expectativas, también sientes mucho calor."
1,Did not work for me,This product is nto safe. The fda has gone after this product several times.I do not know how or why it is still on the market
2,Seemed to work at first.....,"This seemed to work at first and I do not feel it is safe to take as many as directed. The most I took was 1 or 2 per day and it did give me energy while working out but this can be hard on your liver and kidneys. I had a stubborn 7 pounds that refused to shed after many months of taking this and working out, Then I finally managed to lose the weight simply by changing my diet and I also stopped going to the gym ! it sounds incredible but I managed to lose weight by eating lean meats and salads at every meal while snacking on Orville's kettle corn. I never felt deprived or hungry and in about 2 weeks the weight came off naturally without pills and without ANY exercise. I will start the gym again soon but I keped it off by eating a lot of salads and popcorn. avoid pastas and breads. GOOD LUCK !"
3,Stomach Pain!,I started taking these pills and my stomach began to hurt. Believe it or not I couldn't put two and two together thinking that my stomach pain was just something completely normal. It was only after a few days when the pain got really bad that I realized it was from these pills. Of course! I discontinued use immediately and my pain eventually subsided. I bought these pills based on the many positive reviews that I had read so perhaps my experience is unique. I am sure this doesn't happen to everyone but different people respond to different chemicals differently. You know?
2,Way too much caffeine!!,"I tried to use this. I tried different combinations over the course of a week. As someone who consumes no caffeine, I was unable to tolerate this product.The first time I took it I was totally surprised at the burst of energy. I thought it wasn't bad. I could not stop. I was cleaning like crazy! Which was great until it was time to go to sleep. I could not go to sleep! This was on one pill!I tried taking it at different times of the day. One day I tried two pills and felt sick to my stomach all day. I have had headaches almost every day while taking these.As far as appetite suppressing, I did not notice any effect at all. I did not lose any weight, either. I know a week is too short a time to tell about weight loss. But, I just can't take this stuff!For someone who consumes caffeine on a regular basis this may work fine. For weight loss, I can't recommend it."
5,Best weight loss pills,"I have used a couple different weight loss pills, but I always come back to Hydroxycut. Like others, I have a noticed a difference in the new formula, but I think it is for the better. I don't get as jittery or nauseous as I used to with the old formula. I've been taking only 2 a day for about 2 weeks now and I already see results. These are not magic so don't expect to sit around and see results. I have a good diet and exercise 4x/week and these pills just give me an extra boost to get rid of those extra few pounds. I do have to say the two things I notice with this new Hydroxycut: it gives me lots of energy and definitely suppresses my appetite! I am very happy and will continue to use these."
1,Heart attack in a bottle.,"I'm an idiot, I'll admit it.I've been stim sensitive for years.Back in the day I was taking the ECA stack along with everyone else.Then that got banned and I've tried just about every fat burner out there. Some were ok, most were not good.You can put this one in the category of ""not good"".I took one pill with food.And..........wham....Racing heart, Check.Felt like I was going to croak, Check.Dizzy, CheckNauseous, Check.Why did I even bother?You simply CANNOT cheat your way to a beautiful body.Fruits, veges, lean meats, weight training and some cardio and you'll be fine.I got this supplement for free and I'm glad that I didn't waste money on something that went in the garbage the same day.Not recommended."
3,it works but bad side effects,my fiance bought this product to try for herself so infogured id give it a try. i have about 20-30 lbs i wouldnt mind losing. today is june 28th 2012 and i started taking it this past monday and i went from 186lbs to 180 in 4 days. i also came home from work and ran a mile and a half to 2 miles and lift a little bit of weights after but before using this just with running and lifting i wasn losing weight so the product works BUT since taking it monday i have been sick to my stomach which makes me eat alot less than i would before and i have not slept right since i take my pills at 6 am and eat and then at 1130 am right before my lunch break because i had heard if u take it to late in the day it will deprive you of sleep but it is anyways... im loving the results but not liking feeling sick to my stomach
1,Waste of money,Wish I never purchased this...did nothing besides make me feel sick to my stomach...will never be purchasing this again that is for sure
1,not good...,"I didn't notice and significant changes and I didn't loose any weight and sometimes it made me feel very very warm which made it difficult to run or work out since I became uncomfortable. I didn't give it one star because it might just effect me this way. I generally dont react poorly to these types of products.P.S. I took these again to see if something I was taking made these not work well and it didn't make a difference. Each time I took these they made my legs sweat but my torso was freezing, my heart raced and made me feel exhausted. I took them without any other medication and with food. Another problem is these effects lingered for hours. I have thrown away the pills and would not reccomend them."
2,Heart pounding not energy increasing,"I will not use this product again. I felt jittery, nauseateed, lightheaded and just all overall, felt poorly. There was not, for me, a feeling of increases energy but more of an exhausted sensation. My chest felt like I was drummer in a heavy metal band and even though I felt lightheaded and nauseous, which usually makes you want lie down and rest, lying down made me feel like I was sinking in water. Then I could not fall asleep, even 14 hours later.I've heard some people rave about Hydroxycut and I'm glad they had positive results as for me, I'm not taking anymore and as much as I can't stand the idea of wasting something, I am not sure I'd even give these to someone. And is definitely not recommend this product."
3,WOW,"Ok, let me start by saying this DOES work! However i felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest and that was with me taking only one pill a day. After i would take it, i would wait like the directions said about thirty to sixty minutes, then eat. Well about fourty-five minutes after taking this i felt like i was on speed or something. i mean my heart was racing and i had the shakes, i didnt have this problem my first time taking it. only my second and my fourth time. I dont know if it was just me or what the deal was. I did however lose about five pounds in one week, that was with dieting and exercising. I dont take this often anymore, but i have been taking it about one to two times a week and never back to back. My only suggestion is take it and see how you do on this. This just may not be meant for me, i am not used to taking products like this, but i thought i would give it a try since it was offered through vine. Just be careful and follow instructions!"
2,Flu-like symptoms,"I've taken thermogenics for years and this is the only one that has given me flu-like symptoms. Taking it on an empty stomach, I feel out of sorts, nauseous, and sweaty for the next couple of hours. But taking it with food doesn't seem to affect me at all. In neither case have I felt a ""boost"" -- rather, when I feel it at all, I just feel hot and sweaty and kind of jittery. Maybe I still have to figure out exactly how to take it, but frankly I'm not sure it's worth it. Given all the negative reviews here, I'm a little concerned. I'm probably just going to stick with JACK3D, which always ALWAYS gives me a massive burst of energy and gets me up and moving!"
2,Offers a boost in small dosages,"After taking the first dose I felt the boost in my day. However, later that evening I struggled to sleep. Once I stepped up the dosage (according to the packaging) I felt sick for the afternoon, and again couldn't sleep. Never got up to the full recommended dosage since I figured I'd be miserable. Used it while working out for a couple weeks, but was sorely disappointed with the results - There were none. Didn't feel any different (other than feeling worse) and didn't see any results on the scale. Would not recommend this product for weight loss or anything else really. It might work for you, but it didn't help me any."
2,Caused headaches,"The previous version was effective but is no longer available. This version also caused me to have really bad headaches. Unfortunately, I found this out after buying 2 bottles of the stuff. It may also be responsible for my elevated liver numbers. Beware...."
1,not worth it.,"This did nothing for me and i take my supplements as directed, regularly. I was using 6 per day as was my husband, and there was no change in weight. He was incorporating diet changes, i was using diet and exercise changes."
2,Uuugh!!!,"This product almost sent me to the Emergency room. Not only did it keep me awake for hours upon hours (meaning I couldn't fall asleep if I wanted to), It didn't want me to do anything so It didn't give me any more energy just kept me from going to sleep."
4,Pretty good product,"I like this product a lot because it does exactly what it says it will. While I did not lose any weight on this product, I did see a cutting of my body fat %, which could have to do with my increased heart rate and increased sweating while on this product. PLEASE AVOID THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE ANY TYPE OF HEART CONDITION.However, for me it worked great as something to increase my heart rate just enough to get the sweat going and fat loss starting. Do not take this if you do not workout, take the normal version of Hydroxycut."
2,No difference,Old skool hydroxycut works better. I felt mo effect when using this product. I will not buy it again... Ever.
4,"A little stomach discomfort at first, went away","This stuff gives you not only an increadible energy boost, but I use it at school to help me focus. It's almost like an amphetamine without the negative side effects. As far as fat loss goes, It does the job much quicker than working out and dieting alone. 9/10 would buy again"
2,Bad side effects,"I've tried a few diet pills but this one has the worse side effects. Very dizzy nausea, I was shaking most of the time but no energy. I can deal with the side effects as long as it gives me energy. Do not recommend!"
2,Helps Give You Energy But Makes You Feel Off,"I decided to try Hydroxycut despite all the negative press about it. So I made sure to try it for some time before jumping to conclusion. I don't know if this works for some people, but it just makes me feel I'm about to have a heart attack. I only take 1 pill in the morning. The bottle says you should slowly build up to two pills in the morning and two in the evening. I would probably drop dead if I did that. I did 1 pill in the morning and 1 in the evening for a week and could never fall asleep even after working out. The 1 pill in the morning gives me energy, but my heart rate is increased for the entire day, which cannot be healthy. I sit uneasy at my desk feeling like I need to go walk around or something. I get anxious easier and just feel jittery. Not worth feeling like that to me."
3,The Buzzz! The Buzzz!!!!,"This really energizes me -- so much that I just take one pill every 2 or 3 days or so.Since I didn't see the ingredients listed on the Amazon.com site, I googled this product, and found the ingredients listed on another website - first of all, there is ALOT of Caffeine in this product. There is also Yohimbe, whose side efects (although I DON'T know how much you need to take for the side effects to kick in) can impact one's low blood pressure, diabetes, and heart, liver or kidneys. So I erred on the side of caution in taking this product, especially after reading some of the low-star rated reviews of this product on Amazon.But the bottom line for me is: ""Would Muscle Tech Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite be something I would want to continue taking for weight loss and/or an energy boost??"" Considering the ingredients in this formula, my answer would be ""It's been fun, but --- No."""
3,Just more caffeine,"I consume plenty of coffee daily so I have no adverse effects to caffeine. These thermos are purely caffeine and some other stimulants. Ever since they banned ephedra, I never felt any of these products work as well at burning fat. It does provide energy and I take these when I wake up instead of coffee and I have energy all day. You won't burn any fat or lose weight if you take these and don't exercise. However, if you stick to a healthy diet, and exercise, they will work. These just help you to lose weight, but they won't make you lose weight. I would caution taking these if you are sensitive to caffeine as you might think you were having a heart attack. If you decide to use these, start with a small dose first and work your way up."
2,Side Effects suck,"I started this product three days ago. It makes me feel full all the time! Which is great! It also gives me energy to make it through the day! And also through the night... I've slept 5 hours in the last 48 hours and I'm still wide awake. And I am not in any way an insomniac. It also gives me the jitters so bad I start shaking. I love the appetite suppressant part, but sleep is really sounding good right now."
2,not for me,"I was only able to take these for about 5 days because they made my stomach hurt so much. Im sure they work for some people, but I guess my stomach is too sensitive. They also made me feel a bit light headed. Good luck to you all!"
1,NOT FOR EVERYONE,"I have used Hydroxycut hardcore in 2008. I lost a lot a weight and was really ripped. I have gained a lot a weight since then as well as muscle. I'm dying to get back to what i was like in 08, so i decided to try the pro series. I followed directions exactly and for two weeks and did not loose any weight (i was on a diet as well & exercise). After two weeks i got a lot of headaches and one time in the gym, my heart was pounding really hard during a light workout and i had to leave the gym. I was stunned because when i took hydroxycut in the past i felt great. Whatever they changed in the pro series do not go well with my body, so this is a one star for me."
2,confuse,"i started using the regular product, no matter the comments was a little worry about the headaches and then realize was due to a lack of water but that was my fault because i read about it, hear so many comments about this improve version, and was so hesitate to got it, and really feel disappointed, dont get as much energy as with the previous version, (regular) nothing to motivate exercise, still feel hungry, and have a back pain kind of kidneys so stop the products and will order the other one, think everybody is different and what is good for some people not necessarily is good for everybody."
2,Just the same old hype,This product did nothing for my appetite suppression or to increase my metabolism. It's ll a bunch of hype! Don't waste your money.
3,the results speak for themeselves,"I'm happy because the shipping was fast, then the hydroxycut results are worth. I've lost much weight in a few weeks that this was my intention.the truth, the results of the product speak for themselves"
4,"For me, a hard-core energy booster","While I often use this type of product to give me a pre-workout boost, this one was a little strong for me. Not bad...it just ramped me up a little more than I expected.Save these for days when you are REALLY dragging before going to the gym. :-)"
4,Weird effects,"Just took one serving, first time. I workout 4 times/week, and usually take Jack3D, age 40. Effects, in a ""day off"" (I wont workout today):- Feel more edgy, energetic and agitated. (feel the same with jack3D)- Extremely sensitive to odors, I can feel any smell and have a ""emotional"" reaction to it (hate/love/disgusting, etc). That may explain people feeling nauseous after taking it.- Hard to stand still. Had to walk briskly for some minutes just because I HAD to.- My breathing is now ""hot"". Like my inner temperature is higher, metabolism is accelerated.- Heart rate: 68 bpm while seated, my usual heart rate.- Hands feel VERY coldCompared to Jack3D, more energy and less strength. All effects above (but the first one) I felt only with this product. I am writing this review so new users aren't alarmed by its effects. Yours."
3,No Major Rusults,Product is 0k' I would not invest the time in it again. I can feel the jitters and somewhat depressed appetite but I think there are much better products available.
3,I guess easier than drinking a cup of Joe,"Not sure what the bg deal (difference) between Muscletech Hydroxystim Capsules and Muscletech Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite is?Caffeine Anhydrous ~ HydroxyStim delivers a potent and effective dose of caffeine that has been scientifically shown to increase thermogenesis as published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Yohimbe Extract ~ HydroxyStim contains a yohimbe bark extract that supplies two different types of yohimbe alkaloids: rauwolscine and yohimbine. Scientific research suggests that these alkaloids help block Alpha-2 receptors.Besides these 2 main ingredients Coleus extract, Green Coffee extract, L-Theanine , Cocoa extract are added.As with the Hydroxystim I went careful and took one capsule (not the recommended two), felt a slight coffee-like buzz a little bit say 45 minutes after consumption.Experiment and see what difference these products make (if any and of course all heart patients beware ... read the WARNNGS!"
1,WHY DO WE KEEP BUYING PILLS TO LOSE WEIGHT?,"I bought the HARDCORE, beacuse I wanted to keep some muscles in stead ""I GAINED 10 POUNDS AROUND MY WAIST"".The first day I took them I was more aware, had more energy. I was no shaky or jittery, so I thought it was good. Did not get hungry yet I knew I had to eat. By the third day I was already taking the 6 recommended pills and the results were: I was tired, moody, not motivated, I was eating more etc.It wasn't until I stopped taking this crap that people around me told me that I was acting different, not even HYPER but slow and rude. People stop taking pills that do not shrink, but your wallet."
3,Too Many Side Effects,"I've taken several different fat burning products over the years including Hydroxycut. With most I didn't notice much of an effect and wasn't sure if they were doing anything. When you take these, you know they're doing ""something"". After taking them I get what I would classify as flu like symptoms. My heart rate picks up, I sweat when doing nothing, I feel ill, and I get a bit of a headache. I drink coffee every day, I run 100 plus miles a month and I'm in great shape. I'm not sure that a supplement should make me feel like this one does. I'll try to finish the bottle, but I don't look forward to how they'll make me feel."
4,Not Bad,"Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite seems to be a pretty good thermogenic fat burner. Combined with a good diet that I strayed from more than I wanted, I lost about 2 pounds a week on taking this supplement. This does take some adjusting to, so I would recommend easing into the program. Definitely make sure you are dieting and exercising enough, and definitely don't take this too late in the afternoon, or else you will be up all night."
2,Just can't tolerate this stuff,"Man did I get a jolt of energy. It was really fast-acting, too. I took one pill before leaving work and was feeling jittery, flushed, and just a bit sweaty by the time I made it home about 20 minutes later. Then I started feeling nauseated. I suppose I'd lose weight just by how sick I felt at the mere thought of food, so maybe it would work with me long-term. Seriously though, I tried it a few more times over the next several days, but I always had the same results. I'm thrilled for those that get good results with this. Just be careful with it at first to see how sensitive your body is going to be to this stuff."
4,Only for those healthy who want...,"The MuscleTech Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite is more potent than the HydroxyStim Super-Concentrated that replaced the Ultra-Concentrated. It does slightly stimulate metabolism and raise body's temperature, so more calories are burned though it is not the main purpose. There is the feeling of being warmer and more energetic. It is difficult to say, if the ability to concentrate is improved, but the additional energy does prevent being sluggish, improve ability to mobilize yourself, and allow to do things faster and ones that are more difficult. As far as the memory goes, being more energetic and faster does give the impression that the brain does work faster too including remembering. Capsule's 270 mg of caffeine is an equivalent of 3 1/2 espresso or 2 cups of regular coffee. That amount could keep up those sensitive to caffeine. Hardcore Elite seems appropriate for those taking all necessary precautions fully disclosed on each bottle."
3,Thery have re-formulated,"I have been using Hydroxycut Hardcore off and on for a couiple years. I was effective when I needed extra energy for training and nneded to shed a few pounds of body fat. It was dependable and, except for the near dibilitating ""crash"" when discontinuing use, I found it safe and side-effect free. Then the Government found it may cause liver damage. Oops!They have reformulated the product to save our livers, but I have been taking it for two weeks now and don't feel the same, nor have I lost the body fat as effectively. I am looking for a new fat burner. Any suggestions?"
1,absolutely does not do a thing,i took this supplement after reading that it had been revised and then proven by 2 clinical studies. please note that the studies were funded by hydroxycut and the particicpants were given a low calorie diet. THATS why they lost weight....from a low calorie diet. so please dont fall for this gimmick. its once again another product that plays on the hopes of us folks that are overweight that something might help. it absolutely did nothing.
1,Huge Waste of Money,"When I first opened the bottle, there was an oily substance on the cotton, as if some of the capsules had leaked. Took the entire bottle of 120 capsules (six per day), and had ZERO results...zilch, nada, nothing. Did not notice any appetite suppression or increase in energy and did not lose any weight or fat, even though I continued to go to the gym five days a week and maintained my healthy diet. A lot of money for nothing!"
4,Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite,"Good boost in energy, great for heavy workout.On 1st day not much effect, 2nd day extreme energy workout like crazy, improve on the cutting of muscle.Work perfectly, i'm loving it ;)"
3,Amazing Supplement! But be aware of your tolerance...,"This is the second supplement that I tried, the first one that I took worries me of the side effects, so I discontinued it. This is my first week of taking this product, yes I can feel the effect, I feel the energy that boost my body but, I also feel some negative side effects like nausea, headached, feeling hot and at times feel cold and having loose bowels after taking it. I am 5'8"" @ 78 kg when I started with this supplement,with 30 mins on the bike and proper diet, I loose 1kg in just one week.But what I can advice to those who want to try this product is know your tolerance first before you take this product. And dont take as recommended by the manufacture. Take it by your tolerance."
1,dont work!,"This pill dont work well in me. I cant sleep, and im always hungry. Dont lose any pound... Is weird because i use this product some years ago and its work pretty fine."
5,Effective but not magic,"I've used Hydroxycut off and on for years to help shed a few pounds here and there. I can't really say it does anything at all for one metabolism. What it does do well is act as an appetite suppresent. So long as you take it as directed, with plenty of water, you will normally just don't get as hungry. Water by itself will also do the same thing, but few people will drink enough of it to make use of it. So Hydroycut is sort of a cheaters way, but it works for me. I don't use it for more than a month or so and it has worked well for me when I have a few stubborn pounds I want to drop. But its not a magic diet pill. Also if I don't drink plenty of water with it then I get incredibly nauseous, so fair warning."
3,Ehh,"The product varies it seems. When you first open the package it seems to make you SUPER hyper, (caffeine high) then as the bottle is about halfway gone I find myself looking for 2 instead of 1 at a time. I know what you are thinking, my body is getting used to the product...NOPE, its this way everytime, I have used 3 bottles and everytime I start a new bottle I take one capsule per serving and I am good. Weird I know, but I would recommend buying the lesser count bottle."
1,So glad I didn't have heart attack,"when I tried hydroxycut Elite it gave me too much energy , heartburn and My heart beating so fast and I was sweating too much and shaking and I was not concentrating when I talk I felt as if I was an addict also when I worked out I had to stop my heart was pounding and I am so glad I didn't Have heart attack. after all of these symptoms I put this hydroxycut to its right place which is the trash."
1,Muy mal producto,Lo único que consigues con estas pastillas es ir al baño y sufrir de diarrea aguda. Cometí el error de comprar dos frascos y créanme que me arrepiento al máximo pues no bajé ni un solo kilo.
1,Made me sick,I took this and ended up nearly passing out from it. I'm a pretty healthy person with no heart conditions or anything. I think it was simply from the huge amount of caffeine in it. It made me sweat and get light headed and nearly passed out and I was only taking it as suggested on the bottle.
3,Crushed,"Shipping was good and fast and it,was a good price. However, upon opening the bottle I discovered there numerous pills that were somehow busted inside. Which cause the stuff inside them to leave a greasy, smelly, gross film on all the remaining pills."
4,Works!,"Be ready for this, eat light. You will have to got to the bathroom every time you take it. This product cleans you out.... It leaves you pumped up and ready for a workout like take energy drink but with twice the power!"
4,So far so good,"I don't know if it actually works or it's just physiological effect, I lost about 10 pound for two months, maybe after I started taking these pills I actually work out more and eat less in order to see the result. I didn't experience any physical side effect so far. Beside you should really not take this pill after 8pm, it can cause insomnia so times."
1,Awful,"Ever since hydroxycutt hardcore was removed from the market back in 2008-2009, this product has failed miserably. I actually gained weight while testing this out, while on a strict diet and training AM/PM style."
2,Not much energy,"I took these for a week . The first day I first got the chills then became really warm, that happened the first 2 days. In the week I took it I didn't have any extra energy and my heart certainly didn't feel strained and wasn't beating any faster like some people said happened to them. My appetite wasn't suppressed any. I didn't get much from these so I stopped taking them."
1,Did not like,I did not like this product at all. My endurance was low. When I went walking this morning I could not keep up my heart was racing so fast. The product also worked as a laxative on me. I had the runs all day. Everything I ate went right through me. I will not recommend the product to anyone. I only took one and I thought I was going to have a heart attack. NEVER AGAIN!!!! Those of you that can tolerate this more power to you. I guess because I am not a caffeine person this product is not for me. I will lose weight the natural way. The stuff my provider gives me in not this damn strong.
4,OK Cheap Speaker,"You get what you pay for. These speakers are cheaper than the JBLs I got for the main room but for what I use them for they are not bad. The grill falls off when played too loud but the sound is not bad. I use the speaker as a bathroom speaker and being able to send stereo in there with only one speaker is nice. Also, to get decent sound for cheap was what I was looking for."
2,"Rusts, but clear sound","Speaker is rather large, but the main problem is that it rusts. We installed it in a steam shower, so that could certianly be to blame. All the same it was supposed to be for wet installations and I was hoping to make it work. Unfortunately it isn't holding up.The sound quality is quite clear though and even with a minimum strenth receiver (25 watts), with a phone attached as a source I can hear quite well."
1,Author Thomas D. Kuiper Admitted He Cannot Source Hillary Quotes In This Book!,"During an interview on the April 18 edition of CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, self-identified ""conservative activist"" Thomas D. Kuiper acknowledged that he ""can't verify"" that the quotes contained in his book of quotations he attributes to Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton are ""100 percent true.""To those of you who already made the mistake of purchasing this book: ever feel like you've been cheated?To those of you who haven't bought it: save the money, or buy something by Hunter S. Thompson."
1,"I don't judge books by covers, but. . .","Morris' attempt at catching Sen. Clinton lying falls flat on its face with the picture on the cover. Obviously, the title of the book (""I've Always Been a Yankees Fan"") and the picture of her wearing a Cubs' hat are meant to make her look dishonest. In reality, the teams are in two different leagues, and many basebal fans pick a team in each league to support, only choosing sides if the two teams happen to play eachother in the World Series, or an Expo game. (The Cubs and the Yankees have not played eachother at the World Series since 1938).Prospective buyers should remember that Morris was Bill Clinton's stragegist until he resigned when he was caught with a prostitute. Since then, he has released all manner of books condemning the Clintons. There are probably arguments against Hillary Clinton, but Morris is in no position to make them."
1,http://mediamatters.org/items/200604240012,"Kuiper's and World Ahead's vigorous defense of the book did not address -- or even mention -- Kuiper's comments from the April 18 edition of CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer: ""Everything in the book is -- I believe it to be true, but since I wasn't there, I can't verify that it's 100 percent true.""[...]"
1,more right-wing propaganda without facts,"A book of ""quotes"" out of context. Read Hillary's ""Living History"" to find out why she is a Yankees fan. And a Cubs fan. Yes, it's possible to be fans of both teams. As for being named after a famous mountaineer, I don't claim to know the facts, but Sir Edmund Hillary was born in 1919 and was climbing mountains years before Hillary was born."
1,Nice work if you can get it,"Hey, can I get a job like this guy Kuiper? I can troll the internet searching for quotes from all sorts of well-known people & compile a book in no time. Just name somebody & I'm on it.I had to come look at this book after I'd read several items stating that ""author"" Kuiper admitted that he can't confirm the validity of the quotes. Like I said, nice work if you can get it."
2,Sticky mess!,"Granted this product allows your hair to stay in for a little longer (depending on the weight of the hair and how much) then usual hair glue products but, a big disadvantage is that it is a very sticky awful mess to clean up! the bond remover is good to an extent where it makes the glue (which is LGB on BA for CFHE and B) all soggy, but doesn't fully remove the glue. [Bath or shower required] also the remover makes your hair really greasy! The glue's hard to clean up and creates clumps of dried glue in your hair, and if you got it on your fingers it can remove skin when you try to peel it off. Warning: hardens fast, keep lid tight. And use all of it before a certain time limit or it dries out."
5,Missing one of Tarrega's pieces,"The omission of ""La Cartagenera"" is the only lapse that I see with this collection of pieces. Russell even faithfully takes all of the repeats so the works are of maximum length. The only guitarist, who to my knowledge, ever recorded La Cartagenera was Narciso Yepes on his 1983 all-Tarrega LP which was transferred to CD in 1987. I wrote to Russell about this omission but he never responded."
5,An album of extraordinary relevance!,Francisco Tarrega is a poet. His compositions show the feeling and Spanish tradition enrooted with the well knwon Arab influence.David Russell exhibits in this album a fabulous phrasing as well as an overwhelming musicianship.You will be engaged since the first bar. don't miss an unusual and formidable guitar album. Russell is one of the top guitarrists in the actual stage.Totally recommended.
4,Underscore,"New to Tonedeff? I'd suggest you check out ""Archetype"" before-hand, since it is the album he's wanted to put out all his life. But that doesn't mean that ""Underscore"" needs to go overlooked. This album was basically released as a teaser, or a preview to Archetype, and it certainly serves it's purpose. What the album lacks in direction, it makes up for with solid to great songs. With songs like ""Safety First,"" ""Hypocrite,"" ""TNT,"" ""Give A Damn,"" ""Frequency,"" and the ""Love Ain't [rmx],"" Tonedeff released a compilation of songs that contend with most artist's official albums."
4,An amazing amount of detail,"Cunnington's year-by-year survey of fashionable English women's costume in the 19th century is replete with detail. The only flaw is the absence of color photographs, hampering the historian or recreationist who is attempting to ascertain the exact hue of ""Solferino"" or ""Isabella"". In addition, if you need a general reference for 19th century costume, or are interested in the attire of persons of the lower orders, you will have to look elsewhere."
4,Inexpensive standard reference,"This thick, oversized paperback, profusely illustrated, is thecheapestand most comprehensive of the currently available 19th century clothing references. Black and white line drawings and photographs (for the latter part of the century) illustrate fashionable woman's attire. In many cases, details of construction are also given. The accompanying text includes an overview for each decade and minute description, year by year, of hairstyle, fabric, accessories, as well as the costumes themselves. Abundant quotation from original sources. Glossary of terms. Weaknesses (1) no attention is paid to middle and lower class woman's clothing, but this is an all too common fault. (2) No color plates, a real loss for a period when women's clothing achieved such distinctive, not to say, garish hues. Overall, this is a lot of book for the money, a good first reference for this period."
3,I can't see it yet,"I hope I can see this dvd some day, it is for dvd players of region 1 (USA and Canada) and my dvd players are not worldwide region. Attention to this. National Geographic should produce their dvds in a multiregion format. However I'm sure I will enjoy it once I can see it."
1,Cut and Paste History,"Buy this book and you will have something in common with Confederate General John Bell Hood. You will both be victims of author Wiley Sword. The defenseless Hood is villianized by Sword's vicious, albeit eloquently written spin. Hood's critics are given top billing in Sword's pages, while Hood's many defenders are silenced. Statistics are twisted to make Hood's performance appear remarkably poor. Sword's fact-filtering, and cut-and-paste journalism will unfortunately impress the unwitting reader, who will be twenty bucks poorer, and totally misinformed on the 1864 Confederate campaign to liberate Nashville. John Bell Hood has been described as the Civil War's most ""famously unfortunate"" commander. Much more accurate and complete information on the campaign can be found within the pages of Shrouds of Glory, by Winston Groome, who doesn't try to create a villian where none existed."
2,"Not bad, not great","It's always fun to read about a girl that undergoes some sort of makeover in these stories; in this case, a young Englishwoman goes from a burka to a minidress and the king is not pleased.Despite having known her since childhood, he is intent on making her into his lover. He doesn't want to take her completely, so the story is mostly 3rd base action until the very end when they're married. Not a great story because the male lead is so demanding of the woman, and once they come together he 'appears pleased' when she's pained (she was a virgin) by his body.Not a bad read if you have an hour to kill at the airport, but the story is instantly forgettable."
1,Without Music,"Amazon omitted a key phrase printed on the cover of this book: ""Without Music"". I don't know why this book was even published in the first place. Maybe some people just like to read the words to hymns, or maybe they already know all the tunes. Whatever. In my opinion, a hymnal without music is pretty useless."
1,Insulting to musicians,"A hymnal which does not provide music is of no use except for historical, literary or theological study. I am incensed that your initial description does not specify that only hymn texts are provided in this book. I read the existing reviews only to find out whether professional grade accompaniments were included for several numbers, as they are in the version I have. My intent was to buy a similar edition for a church pianist who would have been very pleased to have it."
3,Hymnal,It is OK not enough songs and there are only words no notes. It is easy enough to read but difficult to find songs.
4,"Useful, interesting Marxist history of imperialism","Wood is one of a rare breed--a jargon-free Marxist academic. In this short, thoughtful book, she discusses the political and economic basis of ""empire"" through history. The point is, of course, to better understand the nature of 21st century American imperialism. She achieves that goal. One word of caution--an understanding of Marxism, if not an acceptance of it, is probably a necessary starting point."
4,good bag,Came in a small package and has been a great bag so far. It has plenty of room for all my gym clothes.
3,disappointed =(,"I'm sorry to say I was disappointed with this cd. I had high expectations going into it which were only heightened by the opening song. The problem is that was probably the best song on the album. I gave Showtyme a chance but found that it was a handful of somewhat catchy songs accompanied by songs I couldn't stand (She's Always Home... seriously?) I was thoroughly disappointed by the flow of this album, if your looking for a solid Ab cd pick up Mood Pieces. THAT CD IS GOLD! Every song is a mind indulging masterpiece. The smooooooth old school sound i was looking for... ya dig? PEACE"
4,wow,"please buy this now. download it, borrow it, do something. if you love hip hop like i do, you deserve to hear this album. Abstract Rude continues to represent true hip hop while some of his affiliates (i.e. Aceyalone) seem to be selling out. this is definitely not an example of that.if you are familiar with ab and tribe unique then you know what to expect. if not, please get your hands on this. showtyme is motivational, laid back, fun. listen, its worth it."
2,Desperately needs updated,"An excellent book, and truly one of a kind. But since Flash has become an Adobe product, released CS3 and CS4 and most importantly the transition from ActionScript 2.0 to 3.0, this book is in desperate need of a new edition.It presents tutorials in a way that are actually useful to journalists, rather than useless and overly complex motion graphics. However some very simple coding is now impossible with this book, because of ActionScript 3.0. I found it very frustrating trying to do tutorials in Flash CS4, and not being able to follow the instructions because of updates to the program.For a journalist wanting to know flash, McAdam's book would be the perfect resource if it didn't force you to digress in technology more than 4 years. Until a new edition is released, I'd have to recommend lynda.com over this book.A plea to the author... Please update! Journalist and j-schools everywhere need this resource."
1,My first bad DVD from Amazon.com,I have been ordering DVD's from Amazon.com and never had a problem. Pie in the Sky would not play on any of my players. Lost the reciept so I just dumped the DVD. Next time I'll make sure the reciept is not lost.
2,Know what you may encounter,"The Blackburn Trakstand was great for about 1 month, afterwhich the spindle holder started to separate and had to be continually adjusted. The trainer is not quiet by any means though it does give a true road-like ride. Riding on a road is much quieter. The unit does not come with any information as to what to do about troubleshooting. Due to the expense and the ongoing mentioned problems with the trainer, I would not buy anything from this company without being able to see it and or test it first. If they could work out the ""kinks"" it would be a great trainer."
2,Great for 3 Years,"The first three years were wonderful. The Trakstand Fluid trainer was a big improvement over my first two trainers. I solved the problem everyone mentions - the wheel tensioner loosening up after a few minutes - by butting the end against the wall. I do 100+ hours a year, and was using it almost everyday. Yesterday, the resistance suddenly increased, and I couldn't bicycle any more. Performance bicycle said the bearings were shot, and I could feel the difference. I can't find the receipt. It's been 3 or 4 years, and I don't know what the warranty was. Could have been one year, five year, or lifetime. I guess I will upgrade to CycleOps Fluid 2, at double the cost $300 vs $150 (or $175)."
2,Sending it back,"For a fluid trainer, this one is noisy. I took it to an indoor class, and it was embarrassing how much noise it was putting out. That paired with the fact that above 100 cadence the whole thing starts to vibrate makes this an item I just can't keep."
1,Wrong size,"It was not 35x12. However, there was no point in returning because I would have had to pay shipping again - making me the loser."
5,wonderful book!,"Very informative, clear and easy to understand. I'm very much looking forward to saving seeds from my garden!"
2,Where's the COLOR?,"Although this book has received kudos from others, and it is just alright, I do not find it special in any way, and where the hell is the color? A major part of gardening and seed/plant identification is COLOR! There are NO color pictures anywhere inside the book. This is a BIG mistake. Very disappointing. I'm tempted to send it back."
2,Seed didn't plant a seed with me.,"My husband purchased this book with great anticipation that it would be really good. I found the book to be of 'poor' quality, the page numbers at the bottom being cut off and the binding being poorly done with writing misaligned at the top of the page. There were no color pictures. I felt the book as a whole could have been organized a lot better. I wish my husband would not have purchased this book for me."
4,Seed to Seed: Seed Saving and Growing Techniques for Vegetable Gardeners,"Very detailed information about many many individual plants and species. A very complete book. Highly recommended! You must take the time to read carefully, and also store your seeds safely to make this book work, and keep a dog-eared copy near you while working for reference."
5,Excellent,I was interested in saving seeds for awhile now so i grew some peppers and tomatoes. Later bought this book not realizing that hybrid plants will not work for seed saving. I read this book and learned so much about vegetable plants that i feel next year my garden will be much more diverse and produce more then ever before. very easy to read and understand this is a must have book.
5,Great Book,"Highly recommended book, great for anyone serious about growing food for themselves now and in the coming hard times."
4,"Seed saving yes, growing advice, no","This is a great book for very serious seed savers. However, it has very little information (as in a few sentences) on starting seeds and growing the plants, so look else where for that information."
4,Informative book,This is a good book for an accomplished gardener. A beginner would be lost and bored before they learned anything. There is all the information a person would ever need in it.
5,Easy to understand even for a beginner.,This is the perfect addition to my garden library! I was able to start saving seeds this year thanks to this easy-to-use guide.
3,needs photos,"The book has some really good advice, however I would like for it to have pictures of the seeds that are ready for planting. If not pictures at least they could tell you what the color, shape, and size the seed should be."
5,A whimsical (bordering on ludicrous) picture book,"Harvey Green The Eating Machine is a whimsical (bordering on ludicrous) picture book by Gene Perret, about Harvey Green, a young boy who likes to eat -- perhaps too much! Wild color illustrations by Gary Bennett wonderfully enhance this fanciful tale, and a brief segment at the end teaches young folks about proper table manners. Certain to be popular reading for children K-3, Harvey Green The Eating Machine is a good choice for school and community library picture book collections."
5,A Fun Time with Harvey!,The illustrations are fantastic and the story is wonderful! I love Harvey's rules of table manners!I do the childrens' storytimes at our local library and I have bought this book to donate to the children's department...I don't want to wait until the library orders it!My grand-niece and nephew will also receive a copy!
3,Thin but still cute,"I bought this for my 2, almost three, year old daughter last year for Halloween. It was a bit cheaply made for the price and for what I was expecting. The material is very thin, almost papery. It is cute, though! She looked cute and only wore it a couple times. If you are looking for something to hold up to dress up play I wouldn't count on it and for a Halloween costume it is a bit expensive. She was in a size 4T at the time (moved into a 5 two months later) and it fit fine except it was a little short."
1,Sizing fits small,This item states size 2-4T but would not fit my size 3 child....would reconsider before ordering anything from this site again
5,5 stars after all these years,"This is one of his best cd's in his carreer, and it proves Serrat is relevant after 30+ years in the business."
3,Good but I have heard better,"The last two Serrat CD's have been a bit dissapointing for true lifelong Serrat fans. On ""Sombras de la China"" the lyrics are good, the melodies are too flat, except for ""Los Macarras..."" that carries a good tune."
1,Blackburn trainer,Disappointed that the feel is not authentic. At least I have not been able to get it so that it feels like I am riding on the road.
4,Blackburn Trak Stand Ultra,The Blackburn Trak Stand Ultra Indoor Bicycle Trainer uses a design originally sold by 1up USA as the CPR A-2000 Bicycle Trainer. I had problems with the Blackburn unit out of the box. Lubing the internals of the Resistance Unit (RU) helped only a little. I then reattached my Blackburn RU to the base support arms with the standard bolts and the plastic shroud removed. All of the RU problems disappeared. The unit folds easily and is easier to transport that my fluid trainer. The resistance with the RU varies according to speed and and pedal pressure. Resistance builds more than a fluid trainer at high speed.
1,Don't,"This is a poorly designed unit. I got one a couple of years ago at the bike shop I worked at. While it seems good at first, it goes downhill fast! No pun intended. The other reveiws will fill you in on what it does. I'm returning mine."
1,Backsplash Ring no Good,"This backsplash was advertised to fit from 17"" to 20"" floor scrubbing machines. The ring is not adjustable and will only fit a 20"" machine. I feel I was misled and have wasted the money i spent on this product."
2,"Lots of potential, little results","I was really excited to try this product, but after hours and hours of frustration, I finally gave up. On the surface, the GUI interface is very slick and it seems like Studio 8 could do everything I wanted (record analog video, edit, and create VCD's). It has nice editing features that are fairly intuitive. However, the application locked up or crashed regularly (I installed v8.8). You can use the auto-save feature to help minimize loss of work. When it was running, I was constantly encountering little quirks and made the user's experience frustrating. Plus, it was painfully slow on my PC (P3, 1GHz, 384MB RAM, WinME). Pinnacle should reduce the GUI 'fanciness' and work on making it run faster and smoother. It seems that it would be a great product, if it worked as promised. My recommendation: Wait for Studio 10!"
2,Buyer beware....,"I ordered this shirt for my husband. It arrived today and is NOT AS PICTURED!!! The t-shirt is really gold, and not yellowish ""gold"" as the picture shows. The red lettering is also not outlined in black like is traditional for a ""hulkamania"" t-shirt. Overall, I am pretty disappointed with the shirt. If the seller is going to post a picture, they should at least send you the product they show and not something that is just close."
1,The hulk didnt wear an undershirt like this....,"I got the XL, fits like a slim L. I washed it, it then turned into a Semedium.Fabric is thin like my Fruit of the Loom undershirts. Don't buy if you plan on wearing this outside."
5,"GREAT SERVICE, TOP OF THE RANGE T-shirt! Quick international delivery!","GREAT SERVICE, TOP OF THE RANGE T-shirt! Quick international delivery"
2,A Missed Opportunity,"I'm a die-hard Patsy Cline fan so was hoping for something special with this tribute album. Sad to say, I was sorely disappointed. The only performance that comes close to capturing Patsy's spirit is Norah Jones's rendition of ""Why Can't He Be You"". Norah sounds nothing like Patsy but they sure do share the same soul.I sorta enjoyed some of the other tracks (Terri Clark and Amy Grant in particular) but can't bear to listen to the completely misguided performances of Natalie Cole (I Fall To Pieces) or Diana Krall (Crazy). Both sound completely confounded by their material. Diana Krall's peculiar phrasing of the lyric of 'Crazy' turns the song into the aural equivalent of a sleeping pill. I'm completely baffled by her interpretation. Is it s'posed to be profound? Whatever her master plan, the listener will experience sudden lethargy, muscle weakness and an overwhelming need to take a nap.Pass this one by."
1,Only proves the OBVIOUS,"There is, was and will be only ONE Patsy Cline. Her raw emotion and natural talent can never be duplicated. Not to say that the women featured on this collection are not talented because the certainly are, but there is no bright moment to be found. It comes off as lack luster which is the FURTHEST thing from what Patsy Cline was. There is a reason why these songs are known as Patsy Cline songs, she wrote none of them and yet they are hers, all to herself. Everything else is just an immitation. It is not a fitting tribute to the glory of her amazing voice."
1,Not one can hold a candle to her!,"How disappointing! I have other albums by most of these women, and admire all of their voices, but I am with Ken - this is just so wrong! Not one of these women can match the angst and total lack of pretense that was Patsy Cline. I will chalk this up to experience and just keep listening to (and loving) the original."
4,Remembering Patsy Cline,"searched for one song, Leann Womack singing ""She's got you"". Heard it at a concert, found it on this album. Fantastic, rest of album just OK."
2,One-dimensional,"Even with all the talented singers on this CD, none comes close to the original, Patsy Cline. The renditions are very one-dimensional. It's like an Elvis impersonator...Elvis lives. No matter who tries to copy him, it just isn't him."
3,Not too many good ones on this one!,"I'm a pretty hard-core Patsy Cline fan, so if someone is going to sing any of her songs, they had better ""do it right"" - as far as I'm concerned!I'll be honest and say I didn't much like k.d.'s take of ""Leavin' on Your Mind"". It's not meant to be a jazz song, and listening to it just made me long for k.d. to go back to her country roots and quit this jazz singing stuff already.Same goes for Natalie Cole's version of ""I Fall to Pieces"". After the first 30 seconds of this song, it was quickly skipped over to the next one!Actually my favorite one on this entire CD was Amy Grant's ""Back in Baby's Arms"" - a perfect ""compliment"" to Patsy and her version and really sounds like ""traditional"" country - which is my preference anyway.A few of the other songs were ""okay"", but mostly I was disappointed with k.d. and her version. After all, Patsy was her ""inspiration"", and it was like she was trying to ""distance"" herself from sounding like her or anything country."
2,"k.d., Norah & Amy sound OK...","...but the rest, definitely VERY TIRED. Patsy deserves much better than this, so buy one of her discs instead."
1,OOPS!,"Repeat after me ""nice but not Patsy Cline""Now say it eleven more timesSome nice tracks but why so many cuts at funeral dirge tempos?Patsy Cline didn't have to slow down to a crawl and try to make everything sound like an audition for ""American Idol"" to give this material an inner life.I just hope this does not turn any newcomers off the real deal."
3,just a question,"Ignore my rating. I just wanted to ask if anyone else finds it strange that Mandy Barnett is not included on this album. She played Cline for years in Nashville. Not trying to knock the other talent on this album, but i think missing Barnett was a mistake."
3,Not Bad,"Although the artist's performances are ""okay"", there doesn't seem to be a real flow to this CD. Natalie Cole is dissappointing, especially as the first track on this CD, as well as Martina McBride as the final. The addition of Take 6 on Martina's cut ""takes away"" from what could have been a decent cut. The best performances come from Diana Krall and kd lang, which is not surprising at all. All in all, it's an average CD, one that I probably would not zealously recommend."
2,A well meaning effort that just doesn't work,"On paper, having top notch female vocalists of today (and some simply popular and not-so-top-notch vocalists) bring some Patsy Cline hits up to date is a fun idea. In practice, this is a wildly uneven effort. Some of the arrangements are so bad that they are comical (I won't point out any names to protect the sincere, but guilty) and many of the vocal performances are surprisingly lackluster even from those with usually fabulous voices. This CD just doesn't work.There's another CD out there that tries to do the same with Dolly Parton hits, Just Because I'm a Woman, and that one is very successful. What's the difference? I think it's partly that the artists on that CD are better interpreters of other people's hit songs. On this CD, however, most of the interpretations lack sparkle and energy."
1,Patsy Is NOT Having Sweet Dreams About This One!,"I must say, I am absolutely amazed by the number of good reviews Amazon customers are giving this album. Only a few tracks can truly be considered tributes to, or remembrance of, the awesome talent that was Patsy Cline! Amy Grant played best, while Michelle Branch and Terri Clark attempted to stay true to Patsy's style. Starting with Natale Cole, all of the other artists, apparently, preferred to re-interpret these classics in their own styles, rather than honor Patsy -- they failed miserably. My own disappointment was greatest in Martina McBride's rendition of ""Sweet Dreams."" Martina could have played this much better staying true to Patsy's original, rather than adding ridiculous and unnecessary background vocals. Overall, this was a terribly produced album. I strongly urge anyone who wants to spend time ""Remembering Patsy Cline"" to bypass this album and purchase one of Patsy's. You'll be much happier."
3,to country fans,"The only song that i really enjoyed is Crazy, She did a maverlous job, i never like this song until DK did it , it was a better arrangerment, better singing.Who said that it have to sing like the way Patsy cline did. If you like PK just listen to her version then. When you remake a song it has to be different, when they make a tribute to a singer, they just sing the songs that make that singer popular but they have to do it in their own styles, it just the matter of you like it or not. So when DK did ""Crazy"" it will sound like DK not sound like Patsy cline. So for those who don't know who DK is should not listen to her version of Crazy,for me she did a great job, i don't like songs that remake by others singer but the original singer , this is exceptional because DK made it sound different in a good way. Natalie cole made the 1st song sound terrible that was bad, the rest were just ok. The 3 stars for DK only"
3,Dismal -- except for Lee Ann Womack,"I'll go along with the consensus that this CD is dismal, draggy, and lifeless. But the bad performances of Norah Jones, Natalie Cole, and K.D. Lang are balanced somewhat. Lee Ann Womack is terrific on ""She's got you."" Edgy and bluesy. Rebecca Lynn Howard (who?) is good on ""You're Stronger than me."" Patty Griffin is competent on ""Faded Love."" Jessie Alexander (who??) is Patsy-like on ""So Wrong.""Martina McBride gets the booby prize for the worst ever rendition of ""Sweet Dreams."" Bizarre."
3,Just ok,"I really can't say I loved it. It was good in parts and than slow and boring in others. My biggest problem with the book I think has to do with the heroine. Yes, he abandoned her and so on but after he explains his reasons which were understandable you would think that the wife at some point would understand too, but nope,It takes 245 pages for this 2 to actually get together. After they finally get to lie together something else comes up and we have to read another 100 more pages for this women to forgive him again. The story and the idea is not bad the last 40 pages were quit good and romantic but before I reached those I actually struggled to continue reading."
1,to small for the lettuce,"It wasn't big enough for the lettuce. After I removed enough lettuce to make it fit, it was difficult shut together and seal."
4,nice little flybox,"I have one of these, and am buying another. They fit in a shirt pocket (or in a 5.56 ammo pouch), which my big boxes don't.I also like the magnetic bottom, so you don't have to worry about your little flies coming loose."
1,day's worth FLY BOX,"Picture show's box with a day worth of fly's for $11.95.I thought this to good to be true, i had also ordered a empty fly box that hold's i believe hold's 360 fly's for $22.95.I got the day's worth with no fly's i would have never ordered this product for 12.00for a empty box!"
3,What's the matter with Jayson?,"What's wrong with Jayson? Apparently quite a lot. What's wrong with this book? Just about everything. Blair ruined his career and embarrassed his former employers the NYT but this book doesn't even try to half way honestly explain why. He says that he started plagarizing and fantasizing only under severe mental stress towards the end of his NYT days. That does not square with what the NYT investigation said.According to Blair, it's not uncommon for people in the newsroom to be crazed,or impaired through drugs or alcohol. If that's true how does the NYT get published every morning? I found the book to be too much a defense and not enough of an apology."
1,Was there a ghostwriter involved with this book?,"Upon second reading, I am curious if others wonder about this: was there a ghostwriter or rewriter or professional book polisher who helped bring this book into print? Nobody has mentioned this, and no reporter has asked Blair this, so I guess I will here: ""Jayson, did you have the help of a ghostwriter with this book, because large parts of it sound dictated and then rewritten?"""
1,Terrible person,get it from the library. this guy's a complete loser - look at him. don't let him make a buck off of you please
1,"Addict's ""War Story""","As a former chemical dependency counselor, I take this piece for what's known in AA/NA as a ""war story."" That is, he digresses from honest emotion into what amounts to bragging about exploits. Ultimately, drug exploits are tiresome: ""I snorted a bunch of cocaine, got it on with a stranger, spent all my money, woke up with a headache, blah, blah, blah.""I also agree with the reviewer who commented that the writing is sloppy and the editing evidently minimal. I had to shut the book for a few minutes after reading about Jayson's seeing the Challenger shuttle hurtle to the earth through his ten-year-old eyes. I cringed with embarrassment as he relays the ""touching moment"" when his fellow mental hospital patient tells him she ""liked black guys in her heyday"" and would have gone for him twenty years before. One of many true self-esteem lows that add little to the story!"
1,More lies from a conman,"He conned the New York Times. Don't let him con you, too. (...)The book is riddled with other misrepresentations and errors, great and small, from misspelled names to wrong dates to mistakes that are simply pathetic: For example, he mocks the Times for running a feature about ""orchards"" found in Central Park. He means orchids.Blair's inability to get facts straight casts doubt on the accuracy of his book's paragraph-long quotations from long-ago conversations. Especially since we're asked to believe that Blair was drug-addled, mentally unstable and blacked out much of the time. And even that part of his tale is hard to believe.This book also fails on a more fundamental level: It is badly written and boring, full of long digressions unrelated to his main story. I pity anyone who actually tries to listen to the 10-hour audio version. For Blair, it is yet another dubious achievement: a book that is both evil and dull. Perhaps he should consider another line of work."
1,how did this guy ever get a job?,"Where is the no star option? Blair is a pathological liar--even his book title is a preposterous lie; it has the audacity to imply that Blair is some kind of a crazy rebel who is fighting power/symbolic slavery by breaking out of a slave role and destroying his masters abode. This is plain sewage. He is a fool, an arrogant nutcase and so full of himself that he cannot see past his own privilege, abuse of power and narcissism. He is an insult to every journalist who actually takes her or his job seriously. Instead of blaming drugs, depression and suicide attempts, (he is not the only writer on the planet who has some kind of psychiatric struggle - did Poe, Tolstoy or Churchill lie their way through life?) he should look into his soul and see that the emptiness and broken moral compass within is his own job to fix."
1,"Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be Jayson","The only thing ""burning"" about this silly, badly written book should be Jayson Blair's ears. However, as he has demonstrated through his multiple television appearances, he is beyond shame.Many journalists with drug or alcohol problems get help and rebuild their lives, but the first step to that is to accept responsibility for allowing their lives to spin out of control. Blair sees no reason to do that as long as there's the Grey Lady to blame for giving him a job, an expense account, and even car service.I hope to see Blair, and this appalling book, become a footnote in journalism history. Or perhaps the answer to ""Celebrity Burnouts"" for $200 on ""Jeopardy""!."
4,"Very well done, Who says Brits can't rap?","Lets get this out of the way. I dont like rap. Some of it is quite good i.e, run dmc, outkast, but most of it is (c)rap. However, this child prodigy blew me away. From the Unstoppable ""Jus' a Rascal"" to the Stinging ""I luv U"" Dizzee's musical talent shines through everywhere. Guy can be dead funny too, read, "" I something something Hackney and BOW, I wear my trousers ridiculously LOW"" sorry, you cant really understand what he is saying, but just the overall sound of his voice overwhelms you. Well, not a lot more I can say, except that if you are looking for something different and exciting, and have an OPEN MIND! this is the album for you. If fiddy (wow, he's so cool... what with his bad grammar, because you know we ALL want to hear about your sexual exploits... and yes, we know you've been shot 9 times..) Then look away, This is too good for you.Stay out of the daylight!Isaac."
5,THE BEATS ARE SICK ON THIS ALBUM,"This album is awesome. All the beats are awesome. My favourite tracks are ""Sittin' Here"", ""Stop Dat"", ""I Luv U"", ""2 Far"", ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"", ""Cut 'Em Off"", ""Hold Ya Mouf"", ""Jus A Rascal"", ""Wat U On?"", ""Seems 2 Be"" & ""Live O"". If you don't have this album then you should definitely get it."
5,Maybe Americans should appreciate other cultures!,"This music, its British.... and I am sick and tired of Americans saying its ""whack"". Its not ""whack"" its DIFFERENT, one thing that beats your stupid American Rap is the fact he doesnt have to swear every other word to get his lyrics across... and you say ya cant hear what he is saying.. while i cant understand a word 50 dent is saying... maybe America should learn other cultures instead of bashing them"
4,Dizzee Heights,"Dizzee rascal, what can i say. Hes amazing, i can see there could be some problem understanding the lyrics, even though im from the UK myself, and perhaps too much D n B influence, but overall hes a revalation. If you get sick of American rap artists recording songs about sex, drugs and violence then check out dizzy, his flow is new, different. This makes him stand out from the crowd, after you figure out what hes saying this guy is a genius.Im going to draw no comparison to the Streets, as they are two seperate types of music, so its not a fair comparison.Overall, if your after something a bit different, check this guy, especially the deep tracks like Fix Up Look Sharp, but you americans, listen to it with an open mind!"
2,Innovative remnants,"2 1/2Bad boy brit seemed cooler when he first arrived, (just another case for me in a genre where hoping anything different was good) as the production, while having its share of sublime surprise, highlights Rascal's annoyingly aggressive intonations with primitive melody and hyper-electronica, though the approximately 25 % they do compelling fuse in the often miss sessions makes for provocative mistake."
4,its ruff,"A good introduction to what some call Grime... Dizzee being the first MC of this loose genre to go mainstream. The style is ruff and raw, with seriously nasty distorted, bleepy bass (seems to be the flavour of bass the kids are into these days). The production might seem a bit strange to people who are looking for a rap record; with irregular beat patterns and zappy bleeps.The beats and bass are very good, but no better than some other producers on the scene (check out Mark One). What really sets Dizzee apart is his consistantly brilliant MCing, which deserves to be put on CDs and heard outside clubs.Its true that Dizzee's style is very London, but its not such a London-centric scene any more, so don't be put off looking deeper into the genre. You don't have to know London slang to enjoy it, what he means is usually put across in his passion and intonation.Have a listen to Lethal B and Mark One for more of the ruff bass, angry MCing and raw production unique to the UK scene."
5,DIZZEE RASCAL IS THE FUTURE OF UK RAP,THIS ALBUM IS ILL!!!!!!DIZZEE RASCAL HAS GOT HE'S UNIQUE LYRICS AND UNIQUE BEATS!DIZZEE RASCAL IS GETTING BIG IN THE US NOW.IF THERE IS GONNA BE A UK RAPPER WHO'S GOING TO BE GOOD IN THE US. ITS DIZZEE RASCAL...THE FUTURE!
2,Dont believe the hype,"I'm sorry I'm all for supporting UK urban music but I really cant see how Dizzie is getting all the respect he is. Firstly this is a garage album plain and simple, if you like conscious Hip Hop you wont like this. Yes his style is original and fresh but as a Hip Hop fan you simply cant ignore the production. Much better UK Urban music out there, sorry."
3,Huh?,"I think the reason Americans haven't latched onto Dizzee is plain and simple. We don't know what he's saying. It sounds like he's he has a nice flow, but after listening to the CD twice I can barely make out two consecutive sentences. I won't take anything away from him, because how can I? But at the same time, I cannot give him accolades either. It's hard to judge an MC if you don't know what he's saying."
2,not feeling it,"I'm really not feeling the UK garage BS scene. Hip Hop and UK don't belong next to each other. I can give guys like The Streets and Dizee Rascal a small bit of credibility, but I don't see this as anything more than novelty. The beats are alright, but the rhymes are straight up weak. The only Americans I know who respect this are phoney indie rock journalist who don't know a thing about hip hop in the first place. If you want to listen to they hype, pick this up. If you want the real thing, pick up some Mr. Lif."
4,I can't picture Dizzee Rascall as an American hip-hop star..,"If you've heard the first single from UK rapper Dizee Rascall's debut album Boy In Da Corner, you may be wanting to hear more. True, the infectious beat and catchy hook of ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"" will make you want to hear the whole album but i strongly suggest you borrow it from a friend or download the songs (legally) first. The album is a good one for a UK fan, but DR is not going to catch on that well in America. The problem here is too many of the songs sound so foreign they're hard to understand. Overall, Dizzee Rascall is someone you have to be really into to like, i give the album 4 stars because i enjoy his unique style."
3,"not quite up to the hype, but original","Spawned from the UK garage scene, Dizzee's Mercury Prizedebut album arrives Stateside and sounds more hip hop thangarage. Despite the hype, I don't forsee much commercial successon this side of the pond; his vocals are hard to understand, andthe backing track is mostly stark, stripped-down and notparticularly danceable. That said, it doesn't sound like anythingelse, although the casual observer might liken it to The Streetsor Audiobullys. ""Fix Up, Look Sharp"" borrows a 1980s Billy Squier sample to nice effect, and ""I Luv U"" is entertaining."
5,Stepping on the streets,"I usually go through my fazes of indie rock and hip hop and whatnot..lately I have been leaning more to the rock side but my friend told me to listen to some DR and oh my, this is crazy. I am not a fan of the streets in any way and at first impression I marked it off as streets copy. But I could not be more wrong, DR is creative and inovative in a way that I have not seen hip hop go. Definitely check out this album, just to see what the hypes about. maybe you'll like it."
4,Fresh,"This Mercury Music Prize winning album deservedly finally got some shine and critical praise after the award was presented. Dizzee Rascal brings his unique flow, heavy beats and often interesting lyrics over the course of the perfectly paced LP. Young though he is, Dizzee clearly stands many steps above the usual garage MC and the album is arguably more hip-hop soaked anyway. The singles highlight but a foot is rarely put wrong as a very promising solo career gets underway, few artists have bettered Boy In Da Corner in 2003."
3,pretty Good set&I Like His Presentation,Dizzee Racal is off to a really good start as a Artist&this set has a Good vibe to it.I like His Overview&the way He sees&feels things.I Like the Production&see this Cat only getting better with time.
1,Plain outright garbage,"While fix up, look sharp has a nice hook, you'll be hard pressed to find another quote hook on this album. I was highly impressed with what he put on the Basement Jaxx's Kish Kash, and liked the single, so I bought it. Mistake, unintelligble vocals, which makes it impossible for me to tell if they are rhyme schemes at all, bass inputed poorly - killing any and all flow of the tracks. I don't know what every one is raving about, 15 minutes on acid 4.0 anyone could pop out this music. This is an underground artist, who should remain just that underground."
1,Horrible..,"I usually don't write reviews on Amazon but I felt compelled to do so after seeing the 4-star rating out of 70 reviews. While in a local record shop I asked the clerk for a recommendation on a good hip-hop album. I was looking for something a little more underground than I usually get and told him I was into Roots, Outkast, Jay, Em, Talib, Mos Def, etc, etc.. He recommended this CD very highly and all I can say is the guy should be fired because my ears hurt and I feel nauseous.I have NO idea how anybody could like this. Maybe one decent song on the album.. maybe. I guess you have to give him props for producing the whole thing but trust me, I wouldn't post 90% of these tracks on a personal website for my own family to listen to because I am positive I'd be laughed at.Rascal, you got my money, but the CD is going in the trash."
2,its rubbish,"dont get me wrong. 5/5 for originality, london youth rapping over garage beats. Fixuploopsharp is okay, prob becuase it's all sampled, elsewhere it's ordinary or just far too gone to make sense. Or get your head nodding. This effort is made to look very sloppy indeed by mike skinner a.k.a. mikee streets' 2 albums to date (original pirate material, a grand dont come for free). Buy either of those instead for some tight british geezer narritives over fresh production."
1,FUNNY AS HELL,"LMAO! Only if you would of being able to see me the moment i heard one of this guys songs, it was hilarious! I could not stop laughing. People with british accent should not be allowed to make any rap albums, please stick to rock and alternative. How the hell can you compare this joke to 2pac, 50, Eminem and so on.... You have got to be kidding me! I dont mean to hate but,,,,just listen to one of his songs youll see what i mean!"
4,Someone to watch...,"Dizzee Rascal's Boy in da Corner is both one of the oddest and most incredible hip-hop albums to be released since A Tribe Called Quest's Midnight Marauders. This album by 18-year old South London garage rapper/producer Dylan Mills contains some of the most incredible rhymes and, truth be told, some of the lowest production values any american hip-hop fan has ever heard. The majority of the album (including the incredible I Luv U) was recorded and produced when Dizzee was only 16 or 17. While American hip-hop has Lil' Bow Wow and the like as the protoges of other, more experienced rappers, Dylan produced this album himself. With a speed approaching that of Busta in his prime and a lyrical skill far exceeding 90% of the modern scene, Dizee Rascal will truly be someone to watch in the future. The open-minded (who can get over a rapper with a DEEP south london accent) will adore this album."
5,Best rymes over Garage since The Streets...,"This album is the best rhymes over Garage since The Streets. That's UK Garage, for those not familiar. Don't expect the same bland overused samples in popular American hip hop. This is a whole different beat. Dizzee has great lyrics & flow, truly original."
4,4.5 really but u cant put that,"Lots of Americans moan about Dizzee's voice and delivery just because he is English. He is not just a normal rapper as he started in underground garage with roll deep (they are classic). Now he is rapping and some of his lyrics are superb, they can make u laugh. He covers lots of topics aswell. The beats are also fantastic. Overall its a good album, but i think he could have improved it."
4,"4.5 stars, really",This album should be a must own for any hip hop fans out there. It's very clever. The beats remind me a lot of early eighties hip hop and the flow reminds me a lot of the good parts that Busta used to offer. I've read in several publications about the accent being a distraction but that doesn't take away from the album at all. This is a genius album. I would give it 5 stars but if it was perfect Mr. Rascal wouldn't have anything to strive for.
4,BIG,"as a uk kid, growing up in the uk streets, you start to feel what dizzee has to say. After much underground hype the commercial album was released and made quite a big impact on the uk urban scene. overall a big album.if u like this look out 4 WILEY another big uk emcee.also check me out onhttp://www.2sgfm.co.ukevery saturday 12-2 midday uk time"
4,Best from across da pond,"The rap game has needed someone like DR for a while now. Someone who's willing to push the envalope and be different. The beats are very electronic and sound very cool and are somewhat simaler to dancehall beats. As for Dizzee's rapping, it is very different but still very interesting and in a way... addictive. If you are in the mood from some new and exciting hip hop, deffinitly check out Boy in Da Corner!"
5,Mad Fab 2,"Well, they did it again! The music, the images, the partys, the interviews, the cars... ohhhh, the cars! If you are into cars, nostalgia, attitude and art, you simply can't go wrong!"
1,"Boring, Unchallenging Textbook","Well, surely this book is for young learners. However, the explanations are such a boring text, in the sense that they not provide detailed logical explanations which should be the basis of them. Moreover, the logical thinking is out of date. Do not expect to find new things here."
4,Really good sketch comedy!,"If you like British sketch comedy like Monty Python, Armstrong & Miller, Mitchell & Webb, then I recommend Big Train. Really excellent troupe of actors including Simon Pegg, Catherine Tate, Mark Heap, Julia Davis, etc. Only 2 seasons, but absolutely worth it! Certain sketches are so ridiculously surreal (jockeys stampeding through Africa, ""Something must have spooked them!"") that I wonder the series didn't continue for longer. Of course, this came out right about the time that Pegg and Heap went off to do ""Spaced,"" so that could certainly explain it!"
2,Not that funny!,I can't believe that they compare this to Little Brittain and The Catherine Tate show which are hilarious. Big Train may have a few funny moments but really not that many. I was left wondering if there was something wrong with me after watching this as I usually find humor even when most others do not. This was not worth the $25.00 cost. I would say that even $6.00 ish pushing it. British comedy is much better than this one. Save your money for Catherine Tate when it comes out on DVD here.
1,A Real Lemon,"I received this stereo as holiday gift and was very excited.Unfortunately, Philips rushed this product to market way before it was ready to go. The software that makes this run is extremely buggy, and judging from the feedback on their support website, there are many people who have not been able to get the streaming mp3 feature to ever work. The Philips support staff often take at least a week to respond to any issues if they do at all. This has been the worst customer service I have ever had, and I am not exagerating.I have spent over two weeks trying to get it to stream MP3s (installing, reinstalling, etc.) - I called customer support (who knew less than i did) and posted multiple requests for help on their support website with no response whatsoever for over a week.It is a pity, because the physical stereo is pretty nice. Say yourself some agony, and wait for the next model."
4,great music,"This is a pretty good CD. I'm only giving it four stars, because I don't care for a couple of the songs, and it's not one I would leave in the ""repeat"" play mode and listen to for half the day, but it's enjoyable if I skip the songs I don't care for."
1,Fluff,"Much ado about nothing!-- just a lot of fluff and filler and general rambling about family life. From my standpoint (and I am an aunt seven times), there wasn't anything in this book to recommend having bought it. I feel that I wasted my money."
5,Amazing!,"This is the only anthology of poetry that I have ever read cover to cover without putting it down. This book is comfort, a talk with your best girlfriends, encouragement, enlightenment and thought-provocation all between two covers. I would recommend it for any woman's private library and the libraries of her friends who love good words, moving images and beauty."
5,"For any woman, at any time.","This anthology is a ton of female poems applicable to any life circumstance. I have had this book since it was first published, and it has traveled the world with me. No matter how I feel or what's happening in my life, there is something in these pages that I can relate to. I think any woman would love to own this...great gift!"
4,Best program for home edition,"Its easy and simple to use, dont have to especifie many entries like in adobe premiere, you only have to be a little clever and that's that, incredible easy"
4,Excellent Reference,"I am new to the field of slotcars, and this book serves as a great introduction. Provides an excellent history as well as providing photos and relative value information. If you are into collecting Scalextric cars, this is the book for you. Even has pictures of my much beloved MGs!Why not 5 stars? The only way it could have gotten 4 stars would be to have more pictures, but that would have ben difficult to do..."
2,Out of Date,"I agree with a previous reviewer, this book is seriously out of date. It does give the reader ideas about over-clocking (the reason I gave it 2 stars), but unless you have a OLD processor, it doesn't help. I suppose if you don't want to (or can't) upgrade to a new processor it will serve some purpose."
4,Excellent overview,"This is a good introduction to what overclocking is and how to overclock more effectively. It is easy for a beginner to grasp the concepts, but with plenty of technical information to help tweak for that extra edge. It also has a good amount of reference material about the different CPUs and CPU families in the PC world. You will definitely walk away from this book with more insight and knowledge than when you start page 1. The one downside is that it could be a bit more hands on in parts."
1,Not what I expected...Disappointed,This book is a compilation of old CPUs (circa 2002)and how to OC them. Hardly relevant today. I did not research the book before buying so it's my fault I own it. Not recommended unless you are into OCing old machines...
3,Meh,"If you're really into overclocking, a lot of this info can be redundant. Still a nice book though for an intro and all."
3,Magnavox DVD Player--UGH!,"My husband bought me this DVD player for my birthday earlier this month. I fell in love with it. The screen is a great size, picture is crisp and clear, I had these awesome headphones that when plugged into this player made it sound as if I were in a movie theater.I only give this 3 stars because it just gave out on me 2 weeks after I got it. I thought maybe it was the plug or battery or something but those weren't the issues at all. It was just that the player stopped working. I was extremely disappointed with this.With a name brand like this I did expect a hell of a lot more than just two weeks of pure enjoyment. Maybe it was just my luck or something."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this portable dvd player for plane trips for our little ones. It worked fine for two trips (over a span of 6 months). However, in preparation for our upcoming vacation, I took the player out of its case and it failed to operate. I always felt that the flimsy on/off switch on the side looked like it could brake, and I guess it did. The battery light is on, indicating it has power, but the thing just won't spin the disk. What a waste."
5,DVD+R,"I don't see in the specs that it will play DVD+R and DVD+RW. Happily it plays the DVD+R's that I have burned. I did find that the volume on my DVD's was a bit low, but Radio Shack had a good small amplifier to plug into the phone outlet and earphones with adjustable volume which solved the problem. Regarding JPEG's, it does indeed display them from a CD and automatically start a slideshow if there are multiple photos. I am very impressed."
5,Extremely durable and reliable player,"We bought this player almost 5 years ago right before a trip to London with our (then) 4 year old. This thing has been on planes, trains and automobiles with 2 children and has proven to be about the most durable electronic appliance we've ever had. I'm sad to see the 1-star reviews from people because our experience has been so different. It has survived being dropped from the seat of the car onto the floor of the car (more than once, I'm afraid) and is routinely operated by our four year old without any trouble. It's been just great. The sound and picture still work fine for their purposes and it's still going strong, knock wood. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. In fact, ours is starting to show some serious wear and it wouldn't surprise me if it finally gives up the ghost. All in all, though, it's been a terrific value and I recommend it highly."
1,My player is JUNK,"I used this player 7 times in 8 months the manufacture date is April 2004 and every time I play a dvd on it, it plays for 15 to 20 minutes then freezes.I called Magnavox for support and they told me to clean the laser. I cleaned the laser and it still does the same thing, and I was told it is no longer warranteed. I spent nearly $400 for a player that I used less than 10 times and the company wouldn't repair or replace it. BEWARE!!!!"
5,"Never break the silence, unless you can improve it.","What can be said when you listen to this album? It speaks for itself. TSTGU hails from the Netherlands and brings a whole new sound to the American music machine. This band walks the fine line between hardcore, emo, and indie. Unlike most bands that have tried, they actually pull it off with gusto! Tracks like ""Real Life Motion Picture"" and ""Agnes"" will have you begging for more no matter what style of music you like. Think along the lines of Thursday with a touch of European artistry and a sound all their own. Singing and screaming married together with amazing musicianship to touch the hearts of emo kids and hardcore lovers alike. Definately worth the buy. Check out Sally Forth records for other releases by this band."
2,Could be much better,"Honestly I was expected something a little different.This product is a karaoke, I know, so you have the songs (both instrumental and with vocals), the lyrics appears and they are filled with colors while the songs are played so you can follow them.However when you put it on your karaoke machine and play it all you have is the logo of cars (an ugly version). The song starts and all you see is the lyrics. No pictures of the movie. No scenes. No nothing. Just the lyrics.So, my son still prefers to listen the songs while watching the movie, and I understand that because we can always enable the subtitles (although there's no colors to be guided I think it's better than the karaoke)."
5,"great music, great movie",thoroughly enjoy the music from this one- not the original singers on the cd but it's still cute.
2,needs Karaoke machine!,"Nowhere in the product description does it say that you have to play this disc on a karaoke machine in order to get the on-screen lyrics -- but that's exactly the case. I purchased this and several others for my son to use in a DVD player with a plug-in microphone, and, while it plays the music on the DVD player, it does not have on-screen lyrics. I am extremely disappointed in the product description."
2,Not really what I expected...,"It's certainly an OK bag though I don't find it particularly well-made. The material of the bag is very lite and thin, not exactly what I had in mind. The straps and buckles were very unimpressive, cheap-looking, and hard to work. Additionally, it's relatively small but does what it should --- hold stuff. That's about all it has going for it aside from looking neat (from far off, I suppose.) All-in-all, I did not feel like the product was worth the price and it seemed to be made from very cheap materials. Wouldn't recommend it for others. Pay the extra money for a better bag."
3,Vintage cute,"This bag is very nice, I like it a lot, but I find it somewhat unconfortable, the strap is a little too thin, and it's a little slow to open and close. But looks very good."
3,"looks hot, not so well made...","I love the bag's look...really cute! But I think it is not very well made. I would also like a small inside pocket for money, etc."
2,Alaska Travel Video,I was not impressed. The quality of the video is poor and seemed outdated. Don't waste your money. It's more about history then about the Port of Calls visited on your cruise. The best part was the beautiful scenery.
4,Great Noir!,"A few too many bad guys running around for me, most of them there just to get beat up by the hero. Otherwise, great noirish writing and the hero falls in love with a prostitute! There's a difference!"
5,50 Cent is underrated and needs to be seen.,"50 Cent has the most talent of any underground artist, now that he has hit it mainstream with Eminem and Dr. Dre, he finally gets the respect he needs. If you think you are a fan or you know 50 Cent, then you need to buy this CD. His songs are great, haha, ""Life's On the Line"" is being blazed around my high-school ever time I walk through the damn halls. Ghetto Qua ran also has the beat the ... Smilez & Southstar stole."
5,Before the sell-out,This is by far 50's best lyrical content. Mostly due it being before he sold out. Now he is just another faceless name in the crowd of materialistic rappers. Blah Blah Blah rims Blah chains Blah shinny teeth Blah cars Blah. This album unlike the rest of his is a true testiment to his old ability before the $$$ got to his head. Its a shame but at least we have this album to enjoy one more rapper who has fallen on the materialism band waggon.
5,Ladies and Gentlemen`The best rap artist,Man I never heard rymes so simple yet so powerfulcome out someone`s mouth maybe cuz I been in someof his situation`s in life but by all mean`s thisis the same as all his other albums the best smoothproduct buy it right now. And whoever don`t like hislyrics need to go experience the hood struggle !!PEACE!!

3,#### YOU,THIS IS THE ONLY GOOD 50 CENT ALBUM and the only good album G-unit has ever been a part of i feel embarased to say i actually feel some of the beats on this c.d. because of how much i hate rap today but tis is a descent album and it ahs some heart but that was knowegde to poeple who think you are hip-hop heads and listen to the garbage that poeple call hip-hop nowdays HIP-HOP IS DEAD!!!!!!!!r.i.p. hip-hop 1980-1997
1,GUESS WHO'S DEAD,"SOMEBODY PLEZE SHOOT HIM FOR THE TENTH TIME SO HE CAN SHUT UP....I DID NOT RATE THIZ ONE STAR AND I WISH I CAN GIVE HIM A NEGATIVE 5 STARS.....Yall should get back to tha muzik that wuz made in the 90-99.....not the new muzik that all talks about jewelry, cars and clothes....who carez.....yall people that support thiz clown are idiotz and you just need a friend or a girlfriend because u try to fit in"
2,gory? yes. action? a little. fun? meh,"Reading the reviews here left my expectation for this movie to be at least entertaining. It kinda is, somewhat, but definitely much less fun than what I was hoping for. They didn't really explain what actually happened to the main character 12 years earlier."
2,"Didn't hate it, but...","Didn't hate it, but this should have been marked; for 'tweens' only. The story as writen is amed at a young audience. Good idea, but a better wrighter could have made it work for an older croud. It didn't work for me."
5,I recommend this book to all basket weavers.,"I have had this book for a few years and I still refer to it for patterns, ideas, tips on techniques and as a reference guide for teaching. It is one of the two books, by Lyn Siler, that I recommend to all of my students. The best basket weaving book available."
5,baskets,There are directions for a nice variety of basket type in this book. Book was as advertised and came promptly.
2,"All for being green, but very dissapointed with this tp","I'm all for being green and try to buy recycled & earth friendly products as often as possible. I even cloth diaper my kiddos, compost my trash, etc., and even when my husband is a little ""over"" it I push on. That said, I'm very dissapointed with this toilet paper. It is 1 ply, and rolls are extremely thin, so we're going through it SUPER fast (faster than any TP we've ever had), changing the roll every single day. I'm floored at how quickly this stuff runs out compare to other products we've used. I'll look for a green TP again, but will definitely cancel my subscribe & save to this product and won't order again."
3,Good - sort of,"I have a principle about using only recycled toilet paper and paper towels. This toilet paper is soft (ususual for recycled) but the rolls don't last very long so it's a mixed bag.Still, I keep reordering as it's the best I've found so far!"
3,It's Okay but I wouldn't buy again,As much as I like Green Forest products this one is not the greatest. It IS much softer than Seventh Generation but the rolls are very small. My family of 5 probably goes through 2 rolls a day. If they could put more on each roll I'd be happy with it.
4,My wife likes this better than Seventh Generation tp,"It seems a bit softer, though like the Seventh Gen tp the amount on a roll is kinda low but the roll itself is a little wide so it doesn't fit perfectly on our funky Ikea rollers. I signed up for a subscription from Amazon so I don't have to constantly be hauling the stuff from supermarkets, though the subscription foo seems to have some weird browser dependency issues."
4,Worth it,THE ROLLS MAY BE SMALL BUT IT IS SOFTER THAN MOST BRANDS THAT I HAVE TRIED. GUESTSDONT'T SEEM TO TO NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE. I LIKE IT.
5,Why throw money down the toilet!,"I priced the paper several ways, grocery store, big club stores, online and you can't beat the price. Love that it is delivered no more shopping and carting it home. No more running out of paper. The big plus is good for the environment. Just upped my shipped date by one month so it didn't last the 6 months, but still a great deal and convenient.Green Forest Unscented Bathroom Tissue, 100% Recycled Paper, Whitened Without Chlorine, 12 Roll Packs (Pack of 8)"
3,enviroment,"The toilet paper is great and softer then most, although the rolls are so small that it goes to fast. Each package is wrapped in plastic and then each roll has cardboard in the center so all that has to be recycled which takes a lot of energy and creates toxic fumes. So are we really saving the environment this way?"
2,Green Forest single rolls,"I wanted to buy toilet paper that was environmentally friendly so I ordered Green Forest toilet paper, single rolls, on line. I would not recommend the single rolls. It seemed to me there was hardly any toilet paper on the rolls. If you decide to try it, get the double rolls. I must of missed that option. The toilet paper is soft, but a little flimsy."
1,Not worth it!,"I am very dissapointed with this product. I don't think I saved any money because I the rolls run out so fast because the paper is spun very loosly and their is not much paper on each roll. Also, the paper seems pretty thin so you have to use quite a few sheets so it's totally not worth it!"
3,Very small rolls & price instability - but OK overall,"I bought these because I got a good (great?) deal on them. I would never pay the current price.The paper is OK, but the rolls are quite small. Don't they know they could save paper by putting more tissue on each roll?Anyway, if you buy these, wait for a ""deal"", otherwise they're not worth the price."
3,rolls don't last long,"Chlorine-free is great. Nice tissue. But this comes in small, short rolls --seem to be very lloosely rolled. A roll lasts us here (2 females) about 3 days."
3,Question - Plastic Packaging?,"Question: Is this wrapped in plastic, or in white paper? (I can't really tell from the picture). I'm not going to buy recycled paper tissue, if it comes wrapped in plastic."
2,Quality and value was below what was expected,"The paper's color (definite gray cast due to apparent lack of toxic bleaching) could be justified but the value was much below what was expected. The roll size was very small with very little product as compared to other major brands, although those too have diminished in size and quantity per roll. If they reduce the amount of product any more the rolls will look like a roll of adding machine or cash register tape. I resent ""sneaky"" marketing tactics.I try to support companies and products that encourage environmental responsibility within their products, policies and processes; however this purchase was a definite disappointment."
2,better buy at Costco,We purchased this product because we thought it was a better deal that the Costco Kirkland brand. But the tissue is so thin and feels rough. So you end up using lots. It's a better deal to buy the Kirkland brand instead.
2,Like the paper but,. . . there is so little of it on each roll that they are wasting resources by using way more cardboard tubes than they should be. I have a larger household with two bathrooms and am changing rolls on a daily basis. I would buy this product again if they made denser rolls with more sheets rather than the very loosely spun rolls they are selling now.
2,Kinda rough.....,"It's a great price, especially with the super saver discount but they just aren't working for us. Like someone else said, the rolls run out very quickly. There are only 2 of us using the rolls and we have to replace the roll every 3 days or so. It's also a little too rough for me. I prefer softer tissue like Charmin. Good for the budget though!"
3,It changed,"I had ordered the Green Forest bathroom tissue before and loved it but this latest shipment is different. It is not as soft as the previous packages. I liked this product initially because it was just soft enough--not too much and not too little (I do not like tissue such as Charmin because it leaves lint and seems ""dusty"").This batch is tolerable but I was disappointed to find it had changed."
1,Worst Toilet Paper,"This is by far the worst bathroom tissue I ever bought, it sticks everywhere do not buy this even if they give it for free..not worth even a penny"
1,Expensive and Rough...,"Need I say more?The purported environmental benefits are nonexistent: modern forestry makes the concept of recycling paper meaningless... So the ""green"" benefit is purely emotional."
3,Will thnk twice next time.,"Softer than expected but a roll sure doesn't last long. At 44 cents per roll for only 198 sheets, it's a little pricey."
2,"Sorry, not worth it!","I've ordered from Green Forest several times and love the company, but these rolls just aren't worth it. They run out veeeeery fast. Try Green Tree on this site. They also have free shipping. I still love the brand and recommend the facial tissues/paper towels."
3,This WAS our preferred brand (edited review),"October, 2010: Dang. They ruined a good thing. I've been buying Green Forest TP for several years (see my original, five-star review below) However, I am sad to report that the company just changed its manufacture of this tissue and it is now a rather abrasive, single-ply product, and unpleasant to use. I'm going to have to switch brands, which I am not happy about.Anyone have suggestions for an eco-friendly alternative?------------------------------------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW BELOW:------------------------------------------------------------------------""This is our preferred brand, July 11, 2007""Environmentally friendly (or so they say) and reasonably comfortable... No horrid perfume is also a definite plus. WAY better than the Seventh Generation toilet paper, which is a far inferior product. By comparison, Green Forest is quite luxurious.We also like this company's paper towels -- no nonsense and durable."
5,A great tool!!!!,This has been a very useful tool. It's the type of book that you want to have on your desk at all times. I found it to be very informative and easy to use. This book is perfect if you are new to Personal Oracle 7 and PL/SQL!!!
1,"Never buy this book, even if someone has a gun to your head",This has to be the worst book i have ever used. Besides the numerous mistakes and typo's each subject is covered so breifly that u might as well guess as to what to do. The books title is very misleading also. It says 'for windows 95' when a good part of the book is geared towards 3.11. I think that the only good use for this book would be to replace a broken leg on a couch.
1,Not Enough Problems per Day,"I liked the work presented, but there were not enough problems per day. I think there were only 3-5 problems each day. This was not worth the money, and I returned it. I felt like I could get more for the money with other practice products."
1,It does not challenge the kids in any manner,"I am sure 3rd grade kids can be anywhere on the scale with respect to the caliber. My daughter is an average / above average math student. And she was able to do her weeks ration in less than 10 mins which i find is not challenging enough for her.. My main motivation to spend my daughters time and my time and money is to get her something challenging to her to improve on her math skills. If it is below par her school curriculum, what is the point of this book. At least it didnt make sense for me.. I see it a total waste of time / money..Anyone who is looking for a challenging book, look elsewhere.. I am looking myself for a better book.. Probably i will goto a book store to get one instead of burning hands on amazon.."
5,House of Love - and how!!,"To say this video was excellent would be selling it seriously short. A journey one follows as Amy prepares her CD, House of Love, letting us in on the creative & technical side of things, plus some heart-warming insights into some aspects of this gentle woman's everyday life. Also some enlightening insights into her heart & mind, especially where her then three children were concerned.Add to this, some breath-taking scenery, & some humourous spots in the studio, & of course the music, lyrics & vocal talent that is completely Amy, & you've got one extremely watchable video.To top it off, supporters of Amy's new direction in life, aka husband Vince Gill, have the privilege to witness the sweet friendship from which such a huge love was eventually borne.All in all, an extremely enjoyable watch, something I treasure in my collection, & always will. And will eventually share with my children."
5,OI ! AT IT'S VERY FINEST !!!!!,"Man,this dudes rock pretty hard ! Streetpunk witha marked OI ! influence to it,these trio manges to sound more OI ! and exciting than any other OI ! band I've ever heard ! The complete A Touch Of Class 1982 lp + a myriad of single versions and B sides totalling a full hour.These are a fun band,not politically oriented and that's why the OI ! sound strikes as odd but tracks like East End Kids with an intro consisting of a girl speaking in THE most exaggerated cockney I've ever heard or Have You Got Ten Pencewith a spoken begging for a coin and corresponding negative in the middle of the song are simply hilarious !!! A criminally overlooked band indeed !The overall sound id very good,only complaint being guitars are low in the mix"
2,"This book is only practice questions, not any study material","This book is only practice questions. There aren't even any detailed explanations. The questions are helpful, but you'll need another book like foundations of finacial mangement by Hirt and Block to pass the dantes test."
4,bowling set,We used this game at a spring carnival and the kids loved it. Although the ball kept escaping into the wild blue yonder if it wasn't corraled.
1,false advertisement,"Super-Size Bowling - Sports Bowling EquipmentI received my order in a very timely manner which was terrific. However, is product was advertised to come with a carrying case & pump as well as the inflatable ball & six inflatable pins. When I received the order yesterday, the packing slip states ""does not come with pump & bag as stated in catalog"". How can School-Tech, Inc. advertise all the items that are included then sneak in that I will not get half of the items I paid for in full? I have emailed the company & am awaiting a response."
5,AMAZING BUT... NOT ADOBE,"THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT FOR THIS PRICE. STUDIO 8 HAS A NICE LOOK, IT'S EASY TO USE AND IT HAS A LOT OF COOL EFFECTS AND TRANSITIONS. IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY AND THE EXPERIENCE, BUY THE ADOBE PREMIERE 6.0 BUT AS FOR THIS PRODUCT 5 OUT OF 5 STARS! EXCELLENT!!"
1,Pinnacle Studio 8,"I am not pleased with the product at all. It worked like advertised twice, The third time I could not change/update titles nor could I add their supplied sound. Attempting to add sound would create a major problem and athe status would flicker and quit responding. After a number of uninstalls and reinstalls I avoided the above problems and it would not render at all, just sit there. I have checked the Q&A sections without fnding any resolution. I have e-mailed and have not received even a hello. I do not believe thay are customer orientated AT ALL. I would not recommed this product unless you are very good at debugging commerical software."
1,Are you technically capable and very patient?,"My wife received this as a gift. Not being particularly technical I installed the software (I'm a software engineer). The product generated an error that was not documented anywhere (online or within the guide) and technical help was as bad as it possibly could be. Pinnacle Systems responded to my emails with answers to their most common problems, none of which related to our problem. They had obviously never even read the email. Phone support is non existent (I'm currently on hold and have been for over 30 minutes). I would strongly recommend not buying this product unless you are very technical AND very patient."
1,Beware very buggy,"I wish I had read some of the reviews here before buying this program. It looked great, very nice design, lots of options. A few crashes here and there, but I've learned to save often. The real problems come in when you try and burn a DVD. Its really bad at only burning part of your DVD, which causes your movie to stop in the middle. Adjusting brightness can lead to an black screen on final DVD burn. Still images, which you lay titles over etc, all get lost when you save your project and reopen it.Its too bad, the layout and design is just awesome. I had such high hopes when I read through it. I hope they can fix some of this for the next release, since this version is nearly useless."
1,Look elsewhere for moving your videotape to DVD,"This product and the bundled Pinnacle 8 Studio software delivered spotty performance. It generally capptured the video from tape OK, but the interface (and especially the capture format options) was very non-intuitive. The DVD rendering was slow, and results were hit and miss: some were OK, some failed outright and some were rendered with annoying frequent color shifts (about every 3 seconds throughout the entire DVD). This all took place on a new, fast machine with plenty of RAM and disk space. I'm pretty comfortable with new apps, but the Studio 8 is very hard to figure out. Consider the PYRO A/V link from ADS instead."
1,One star is one too many,"Without question the most frustrating software application I have ever had the mis-pleasure of having to work with. Slow - despite a top of the line duo-core processor and terrabytes of storage - doesn't begin to describe the time that is required to render a project. You can count on the render process to hang approximately 95% of the time and that's the least of the aggravations. My last project using this so called ""solution"" corrupted the audio track in the time line, globally replacing the selected audio clips with different clips though leaving the original file name in the time line - so it wasn't until print to tape one was able to discover that the theme music was now inserted at minute 34:45... Pinnacle's customer support is non-existant. If you work on a deadline don't use this product, you will not be able to complete your projects in anything resembling a reasonable time frame. Completely and utterly worthless."
1,Pinnacle HATE their customers - Be warned: there is NO support.,"Don't bother emailing Pinnacle if you have a problem with their software - you may as well expect a personal reply from the Queen - It just never happens. There are so many things wrong with this program. A lot of little annoying things and some very big frustrating events that there are no fixes for. Pinnacle's original creators should be ashamed of being associated with crap that looks like it was developed in China. Of course it would be nice to give them some feedback but they do not ever, under any circumstances respond to any emails from users. Remember, professional studios would never use anything like this - and now you know why.Go out and buy something reliable like Video studio."
2,"OK at video editing, awful for DVD burning","I was OK with Studio 8 for the first few months I had it, I made simple VCDs and DVDs of my friends, it was amusing.Then I tried to make some more complicated things, with multi-level menus, and a number of different file types, and fill up the whole DVD. I ended up with about 5 coasters. The pinnacle tech support was no help at all.Then I found TMPG DVD Author, used to make DVD files which are then burned from within the program or burned with Nero. TMPG has not produced any coasters yet. Now I do all my editing/transitions with Studio 8, render it, and use TMPG to actually make the DVD.So all in all, I had to spend an extra $90 for a REAL dvd authoring progam to go along with Studio 8."
2,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs","Log onto their technical support website and you'll see the array of problems people are experiencing with this product. Great features and great idea. Doesn't appear that they tested this product thoroughly enough. I'm running Win XP, 2.4 G, 160GB HD, 512 DDR RAM and after each capture the program freezes. Program won't recognize my DVD burner as many others have experienced as well. Beta version is available for download on Pinnacle's site, but I don't want Beta. I want a workable product if I am going to shell out $$$."
1,Incompatible junk,"My Sony DVD writer is a popular piece of hardware. Studio 8 does not work with it.For any price, it is a total waste of money. Even trying to edit video from other sources does not work.It will capture from my Panasonic Camcorder, but what good is that if it won't write to DVD.It is VERY picky software. I do NOT recommend it."
1,How to Meditate with your dog,The first part of the book was good. The rest of the book was about him and his dog! It really didnt help me!The Reiki with animals tells you more about how to meditate with your dogs!
1,you all must be kidding---or relatives of his,"""Meditating with your Dog"" is a waste of paper and ink and my time. Jacobson manages to take one idea (quiet time) and rewrite it 100x in 175 pages............I guess that's quite an accomplishment."
1,Meditation,"Sorry. This was one of the silliest books I have ever seen on Meditation. I have two dogs, and I think I could explain meditation with them far better than this book does."
5,Hooked on Meditiation,"Since I adore dogs and never was without one, I started reading ""How to meditate with your Dog"" eagerly. The whole concept of meditating with my greyhound Lilly interested me. On a rainy day, right off in the morning we got started. Lilly really enjoyed having me so close to her. Meditation set the tone for the day. Without problems she even took her mediaction, and I was not stressed out over it (as she refused to take it on other mornings). I used the techniques James Jacobson talks about, and I will continue to do so. This enjoyable little book definitely can have a huge impact on you and your relationship with your best friend.Martha Boeker"
5,Beautiful Book,"This book, I have read it about half way thru, and I really think it is beautifully written and will be an asset to my dog and I as we continue to learn about one another. She is a 4 year old mini-pen and very excitable and hyper, I truly believe this will calm her and me, and take us to a place where we can be one. Thank You James."
5,An exceptional Journey,"As much as some might not admit it, our animals are an extension of ourselves. Like human children, our furry kids feel our joys, grieve our pain, and know our moods. James gives us yet another avenue to travel with our beloved animals to create a deeper connection, and love. Do you remember love?? A warm insightful read. Well worth your time. go ahead...just try to read only 1 page!!!"
3,Interesting,Ayn Rand was said to have stolen her idea for Atlas Shrugged from this book. I don't see it. But nonetheless it is an interesting story that may have inspired her. Worth reading for that purpose alone.
5,Font,"I have had to read this book with a magnifying glass because the font is so small.I do a lot of reading and writing, and I have to protect my eyes from fatigue.The other copy, listed for around $20, has 200 pages compared with 140 pages in this book andthe size of the other book is larger. When I had ordered this cheaper book, I didn't see thevalue in paying more. I do now and I have decided to order the other copy so that I can enjoythe story. It is worth paying more for larger font when it makes the story easier to read.My research came from'The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading,' by Edmund Burke Huey, an excellent book for avid readers,particularly for preveting fatigue from lots of reading.My rating, of five stars, is based upon the story."
1,where's the book,"This book is about 70 pages of recruiting information and 125 pages of addresses and phone numbers of schools. Given the fact that 25 pages are made available with the ""look inside"" feature, you can read 1/3 of the book online and get the names, phone numbers, and addresses of schools using the web or at the library.The book provided some decent information at best, but when I got to page 80? and realized the book was over, I didn't feel very good and I certainly didnt need 125+ pages of addresses of schools I have no need to call or no desire to call.."
2,Try another one if you are not a fanatic,"This movie was poorly made. Too much fade in/fade out. Long interruptions. Few actions scenes, and generally too short. For instance, a scene in Hillary Step have a duration of just 4 seconds. It seems they made it just to pay some expenses of the journey. The only good thing is that they reached the top of Everest."
4,"If I was going to make them myself, this is how I would have done it.","Of the few kitchen-wall-rail systems out there, this one happened to fit the small wall we needed to hang cooking tools on. They're extremely well made, surprisingly heavy gauge, nicely finished, stainless steel & they look pretty good as well.The only down-side is they leave your wallet feeling a bit violated.I would buy them again unless I had enough time to make them myself."
1,Very dissapointed.,"The fragrance is very common, it doesn't last and it doesn't make an impression. Luckily, I ordered the 30ml bottle by mistake."
3,optical jealousy,"a high tech guru morphs reality and sexual fantasy for his 'fin de siecle' devotees on a remote island enclave off san francisco. off-beat, provocative theme, steady pacing and a narrative which shows a depth of insight and introspection beyond the norm."
4,Used with Gilmour 75QGFMR Foamaster,"Great foaming action but I wish I had a power washer to really do it justice. Using the Gilmour 75QGFMR Foamaster and just hose pressure makes foam well enough but it's still a bit wet and runs off the car quickly.I still found it a superior method to washing with a sudsy bucket though, especially in winter. Less time spent dipping in the bucket and more washing the car.- D"
3,A mix of heaven and Las Vegas,"I think this is a mundane version of previously heavenly Cocteau Twins. Much of the dreamlike quality in Treasure (darkly) and Victorialand (airily) is lost, and Blue Bell Knoll is a more emotionally powerful album. While the songs are pretty good and Liz's voice is still strong, the listener feels that he is simply listening to songs instead of being engulfed in a mystic atmosphere. There may be reasons to love the Twins' matured sound, but I am one of the people who miss their more creative young days."
4,One of their most accessible releases,"Though this is not my favorite Cocteau Twins CD (that title belongs to _Head Over Heels_), it has my favorite Cocteau Twins song ever: ""I Wear Your Ring"". The overdubbed vocals of Elizabeth Fraser towards the end of that song create one of the most beautiful and trance inducing passages I have ever heard in popular music. The album has other great songs like ""Road River and Rail"", ""Pitch the Baby"", and ""Fifty-fifty Clown"" that rank among the CT best, but it also has some that are not that great (and even boring) and that is why I give it 4 stars. If you like the Cocteau Twins poppier side, this might be for you. If you like their more experimental and darker side, try _Head Over Heels_, _Treasure_, or _Victorialand_ instead."
5,Confection,"OH! Let me hear!! Forever and ever the gossimer threads of sound that these mad seamstresses spin! They collect at the bottom of my ears, pure and many shades of gold like so many honeys. Warm and thick it licks your eyelashes, your nose, your toes and your tummy, beckoning you back into the rosey dreams you crave. OH! Let me feel!! Forever and ever the cashmier colors and even softer wispers of promises, promises that will always be kept. Promises that my dreams will always sound like this. But promises even sweeter still, that waking up will be just as beautiful."
5,A hazy musical Joyride by the Cocteau Twins.,"A fun-filled parcel of songs (10 actually), this album contains some great rhythmic-melodic tracks like ""Iceblink Luck"", ""Frou-Frou Foxes In Midsummer Fires"", ""Heaven Or Las-Vegas"" and my personal favourite ""I Wear Your Ring"". Vintage Cocteau Twins, this album is a real ""upper"". Elizabeth Fraser sings beautifully and playfully in this album and is even (alittle) coherent at times."
4,Cherry Coloured,"another jaw droppingly good album from this amazing band. is this better than ""Blue Bell Knoll""? hmmm...possibly. equally as great and wonderful. always a joy to listen to. ""I Wear Your Ring"" has made it to countless mix tapes for friends. the whole album is a delight."
5,Essential Listening!,"I bought Heaven or Las Vegas on cassette back 1990 and must have played it hundreds of times. This is my absolute favorite out of all of the Cocteau Twins' releases, and even now, twelve years later, the music still strikes me as fresh and beautiful."
3,uneven,"being or was once a hardcore fan (i`ve slowed down the collecting now) i say this album has one of the greatest string of tunes ever put together on a music CD/LP. yes, i`m speaking of track 1 all the way to track 5 (the titletrack). then, all of a sudden my heart and soul looses touch wit the album. as soon as track 6 (i wear yr ring) pops out of the speakers. it`s kind'o strange. ofcourse, this is what happens sometimes. that`s what makes music bigger and more puzzling than magic performed by magicians. nevertheless, this is a so-so album from the cocteua twins. some really great tunes, but it lacks as a whole. unfortunately."
2,poor sound quality,"Compared to the earlier, excellent, albums, this one sounds poor. Almost like recorded with a single microphone!In terms of creativity, nothing new to be exciting about. Skip this album, go for the famous earlier cultures like Garlands (or Treasure, if you dont have them already)."
5,"Ethereal, beautiful...","Ah, this album...I feel in love with the music the moment I heard it for the first time, while traveling on a month long road trip out west in 1994. Elizabeth Fraser sounds like a goddess, with a light yet deeply soulful and rich voice. Songs like ""Cherry Coloured Funk"" are so gently rhythmic and harmonizing, that you feel like you're at the verge of discovering something completely profound yet refreshingly simple. I envision myself back out on the open road, miles of highway and scenery stretched out before me, or sitting on a beach looking out across the ocean. This is where the music takes me, and it will you, too...Buy this album! It's their best, in my opinion, with Four Calendar Café coming in a close second."
5,A Must,"This is one of those rare albums that I can listen to from start to finish- and that's without being able to comprehend ONE word being sung! I love to sing along, however, making up my own words and wondering about the process that goes into writing these beautiful compositions. Think I'll go listen right now- and you should too. One of the top 5 albums of all time, IMHO."
2,Disappointing,"While the topic material is intriguing enough, with some great segments interjected, this wasn't well presented. It tended to drag badly rather than educate or entertain. Plus the cover picture is badly misleading."
3,Contains some opinions rather than fact,"Not a bad read. But like any biography must be taken in context. Weston was definitely and interesting man. He was a great contributor to his craft. Without a doubt this is a good read, but like anything it is only part of the story."
3,Sex,"A delicious read, passionate, imaginative and not very accurate. Maddow was obsessed with Weston's sex life but that may have helped Weston's fame and Maddow's sales."
4,Volume III of the collected De Quincey,"Contents:* On The Knocking at the Gate, In Macbeth* Murder, Considered as One of the Fine Arts* Second Paper On Murder* Joan of Arc* The English Mail-Coach* The Vision of Sudden Death* Dinner, Real and Reputed"
4,Mintek player with a name change,"I have compared the 8-inch Magnavox with the 7-inch 1770 model from Mintek and they are very similar. The switches and jacks are all in the same places, and the battery configuration is identical. The power switch is exactly the same. I suspect that Magnavox got their players from Mintek, then put their more recognizable name on them. Since Mintek is a very small company with no track record, you might want to check out their reviews before you buy this player. I've had the Magnavox for 2 weeks, and the Mintek for 2 months, and so far they both work fine. But when you buy a big name brand, you expect that it is more reliable than the unknown maker. In this case, I don't think that assumption is justified. That's the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5."
1,Magnavox sucks!,"I purchased the 7"" Magnavox portable DVD player 7/30/2004--not even a year ago. My husband and I are preparing for our summer trip and decided to charge up the DVD player (which at this point had been used ~3 times) and it was completely dead. When I called Magnavox they offered to exchange it for another one for $249.00 plus shipping. I paid $265.00 for a new one last year. Magnavox does not stand behind their name. Either buy an extended warranty on this product or do not buy it. I will never buy Magnavox again!"
2,Noisy skipper,"I am impressed by all the features offered by this dvd player. I have been using my laptop to play workout discs and having something just set in place all the time or something small (and it is pretty small) you are able to take on the road with you, is very handy. This is a solid little player (did I say little?) and comes with lots of plug-ins and features. My main complaint: sometimes it sounds like a race car grinding gears when it starts up and sometimes it'll just start grinding in mid-play. It can also have trouble loading a disc unless you really press down onto the spindle. It tends to freeze sometimes in the midst of playing and then it moves on. It does the same with movies sometimes and other times it plays right through. So over all I would say it's a good machine but a little erratic. The price was certainly right and I'm not looking for anything more serious or expensive for my uses."
4,No problems after 1.5 years,"We've had no performance issues with ours. Have two boys, 6 & 4, who are the primary users so it's not exactly been handled with care. It still holds up well, loads the discs with no problem. My only complaint would be that for some movies, I'm not able to get the image bright enough to be seen clearly. This thing has saved our sanity on many cross-country trips to visit family. Has done well both in the car and on planes."
3,Great DVD/Not so great car case,"I paid extra so that I'd have the car bag for easy installation into our vehicles. I don't want the unit loose in the car, in case of accident. First and only trip with it, except for storage it was never in the bag. That's because of the case set up. When you strap it in as shown and put the DVD unit in, at least in our vehicle, you can't view the screen because it's always tilting down. I tried numerous strapping adjustments, nothing corrected this. I've taken it back to the store and will be buying one that the case and unit sits flush against the seat."
5,A fantastic little wonder!!!,I had been researching portable dvd players because I knew I would be wanting one to keep me occupied on those long trips. I looked at the electronic stores to see the new models and demostrated quite a few. I had almost given up when I went into my local Wal-Mart and found this player on the shelf for a price of 238.00. I brought the player home and for some reason the player I got the battery would not charge. It must of been a defective battery. I returned it and was hesitant about getting the same player but boy am I glad I did. This is a great portable dvd player. The picture is fantastic!! Even the sound is very good but hook up a pair of headphones and the sound is amazing!! Anyone looking for a portable dvd player make sure you take a look at this model and you will not be disappointed!!
2,Another Broken Player,Like many of the other reviews on this page the DVD player broke after about a months use. You can hear the sound but the screen doesn't work.Sounds like a defective product to me.
1,Mine died after less than 20 hours use!,"I'm at this page now, looking for the warranty and return policy for this piece of junk. While I love the player itself, I hate that it died on me after less than 20 hours of use (over a 3 1/2 month window!).It's also a shame that you can't do any seeking without the remote control. I found that rather lacking and very annoying when I wanted to rewind a scene a few seconds. Where's that remote again?My advice is to buy a unit with better reliability!"
1,Enjoy Your Shiny New Paperweight,"This product demonstrated its unwillingness to work as soon as I put my first DVD in it. It was so scratch sensitive that it began skipping and hanging up on one of my own films immediately. I knew that if this thing handled my own purchased DVDs like that (which I take good care of), then it doesn't stand a prayer with the scratched, hacked copies the rental places distribute. An inability to read through simple scratches is a must nowadays, given the technology these players are capable of. Luckily I was still within the warranty period, or else I'd be taking slapshots with this player against my garage door."
1,Breaks so fast you better not blink,"We were only 45 days past the 90 day warranty when the screen went blank. Called customer service and he actually tried to look up an electronics repair shop with in 25 miles where I could take it on my dime. The last time I tried to get an electronic device repaired was $75 per hour (minimum 2 hours) plus parts. He was serious and this on a device that sold new for $228. I asked about the ""91 days-One Year Reduced-Cost Exchange"" that was mentioned in the really ""limited warranty"". Regretfully, he almost injured himself in trying to keep from laughing out loud. In the straightest voice he could muster, he said ""send us $250 and we will send you a new product, the same product, at a higher price, but new...plus shipping. I forgot to ask if I had to send in the defective DVD player. If you must buy this product, get the extended warranty. This from a guy who hates extended warranties I filed a complaint with the BBB."
1,Magnavox MPD720 - WORST PORTABLE DVD ON THE MARKET - BROKE AFTER 3rd VIEWING,This is one of the most expensive DVD players on the market and it broke after the 3rd time it was used. That is a whole lot of money to flush down the toilet!
1,broken after 4 months of use...,Do not buy this product. I bought this for my daughter for long car trips etc. and it broke after 3 months. She didn't even use it that much. This product is not worth the money!!!
1,Piece of crap,"Worked for 1.5 days, then just stopped, despite the fact that we didn't drop it, spill anything on it, or otherwise do anything that could cause any damage! Tried using BRAND NEW DVDs, and it wouldn't play them. Don't waste your time or your money!!!"
4,"Nice player, but it's just a Mintek.","I have the MPD720 and the Mintek 1770 side by side and they are sourced from the same manufacturer (as another reviewer noted). The software is identical (uses same IR remote codes) and the lithium ion batteries are identically rated (mAh). Build quality is also equivalent. This unit does NOT have s-video support as listed, so beware! (the 1770 does). The Magnavox only comes with a 90 day parts/labor warranty; the Mintek 1770 has a 90 day labor, 1 year parts warranty. Save yourself the Magnavox $ premium and get the Mintek."
1,Poor quality and noisy,"I bought this DVD player and car kit from WalMart. I used it on a weekend road trip to keep my boys occupied. It was noisy, tracked poorly, skipped every few minutes, and by the last half hour of the movie it wouldn't play at all. I tried playing about 6 different DVDs with this-- all with the same result. 2 of the DVDs couldn't even be read. It seemed cheaply made and you had to STUFF HARD to get everything into the bag it came with, so there was no room for additional DVDs. I immediately returned this player and bought an Audiovox D1708 from QVC. It's quiet, feels solid and has played all the DVDs perfectly that the Magnavox wouldn't. There's even room in the bag for a couple of DVDs."
4,Bomb shizel my nizel.,"Over Christmas break my family is going on vacation. To survive the trip my parents decided to get a portable dvd player.I watched movies on it in last night and it was excellent. It didn't skip one time and the picture was flawless. I couldn't tell you about the battery life because I had it plugged into the wall for the 3 movies that I watched.It wasn't all that loud, so if you are in a car with a few people in it you might want to get extra speakers.Over all this player is off the heezie fo sheezy my nizle frizle dawg for real."
1,Not as advertised.,"This is not a serial, nor was it produced in 1950. The Editorial Review is an accurate description of the disc, but that is at odds with the title header. So, buyer beware."
2,Feel ripped off,"Amazon advertised this as being a 'serial'. Unfortunately, this is NOT the same 'Pirates of the High Sea's' that starred Buster Crabbe. Probably will try to send this back."
3,One of the original documents of Rastafarianism,"This short pamphlet contains the entire text of 'The Promised Key', a proto-Rastafarian document from the mid-1930s. This document is primarily of historical interest.The text itself is a much edited-down redaction of another, earlier, proto-Rastafarian text, 'The Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy.' Along with the latter and 'The Holy Piby', this is one of the three root texts of Rastafarianism.Also included is an essay by a Rastafarian scholar which explains the historical context of this rare document (which is twice as long as the actual text of 'The Promised Key').This pamphlet is a must-have if you are studying the roots of Rastafarianism or Jamaican religious history in an academic context. It will not be of interest to general readers or those looking for information on contemporary Rastafarian philosophy; there are many other books which are much more relevant."
4,Real Item Description Without Mysteries,"As there is no tracking information on this listing, and because I have all the different releases using this title, I will put the real tracking information here for fellow shoppers. This is the release on Dance Street Records - Division of ZYX. 1- ""Sadeness, Part 1"" (the REAL Enigma - Extended Trance Mix) 2- ""Hymn"", by Magna Canta (Deep Spirits Mix) 3- ""Lesiem"", by Lesiem 4- ""Humming Chorus"", by Amoure 5- ""Muse"", by Innocent Voices 6- ""Alleluia"", by Prayers 7- ""Ave Maria - Oh Mary"". by Dario F. 8- ""Pange Lingua"", by Odi Et Amo 9- ""Noslepums"", by 100 Debija 10- ""Through the Seas of Life"", by Pilgrimage 11- ""Conquest of Paradise"", by Trance Opera"
5,SUPERB STORY,"HE DID IT AGAIN, ANOTHER HOME RUN FOR THIS GUY. THIS IS A REAL FREAKY STORY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE COMES UP WITH THIS STUFF....."
5,Brilliant,Page after page of an interest keeping story line. Superb use of characters and personalities. One step beyond madness as the story ties itself together for a fabulous crescendo. Two thumbs way up and over. Must read. : Mary.
5,A +,"Disturbingly enjoyable. This is one sick and twisted story. A friend recommended it to me recently. My friend is a bit strange. Any way, I am very happy he mentioned ""sheep"" to me. I really didn't want to put it down. My interest was kept from the start. Truly some bizarre events in here. Just like the back cover says, ""Artistically deranged"""
5,HOLY COW!!!,"I do mean that..... Normally I don't rush to write a review after a book, but this one was an exception....."
3,Not for home DVD recorders,"I bought several packs of these, thinking I was getting a good bargain. The only problem is that they are not intended for home DVD recorders (I own a Panasonic DVD recorder EMS30). They record perfectly, but the menu and forward feature won't work on these discs when you play them back on your regular DVD player. They are intended for a computer DVD-R drive, which I don't have. If you are purchasing blank DVD-Rs for your new home DVD recorder, make sure that they are for just that, a home DVD recorder and not for computer drives. It will save you time and MONEY."
2,Performs Poorly on Philips DVDRW228,"This disk performs poorly on Philips DVDRW228 internal drive. About 30% of the disks I make from a direct burn, or as a copy from a DVD+RW turn into coasters. I don't have this many from the other brands."
1,Not for real golfers,"I spent a dollar on this at Borders and I wish I could get my money back. It is full of over-used golf sayings that are funny the first time you hear them, but if you're a golfer who has played for a while, you've probably heard them a thousand times. The stories either lacked plot or ended abruptly. It's like these authors didn't know how to write a short story. The stories that setup the plot well and described things fully, ended quickly. It felt like the editor gave them a certain number of pages they could write and they shoe-horned a story into it.If you want a good book about mystery and golf, this isn't it. I would stick to the true story books and enjoy the 'stories' that actually happened over the years in this great game of golf. If you want a book of short story mysteries, there are much better ones out there, but they aren't centered around golf."
3,Basic but good,"Simple, basic truths about hospitality. It's a bit dated but enjoyable nonetheless. I felt it was a great starting point as I wanted to embrace hospitality as a gift rather than a chore. It's a quick read and you will probably find a few points made by the author that cause you to think ""that's a great idea!"" My guest room will never be a second-thought room or oversized closet again. I'll keep this cozy book on my shelf for a long time."
5,Amazing throwing knife!!!! Solid,Great product and can stick it almost every time just need the find the right spot. This is the second one i have purchased
4,"Excellent steel, excellent edge, too heavy","When I looked at the picture, I thought it was a double-edged throwing knife, but that is not so. One-sided blade. It came razor sharp out of the box, and one entire edge is sharpened (apparently for utility purposes, it said). The entire thing is one piece of metal, so that is good as well. I'm not sure how long the paracord handle will stay on it, but I'm sure I'll find out soon enough. If you like throwing from the knife tip and not the handle, then I think you'll be disappointed because it is far too heavy for me to grip it like that, especially with the black coating on it which makes it slippery. It is definitely an awesome knife though."
4,Cold Steel True Flight Thrower - A Customer's Review,"Product arrived fairly quickly, just over the stated delivery estimate, in roughly the stated condition. The blade is almost nearly center, which is decent considering the price of the purchase; however, the grade of steel stated, I feel, is of lesser quality than stated as it had received a few nicks and the tip/point had bent into a small nub after only a few experimental tosses. All in all, a good product for its price but one should be wary of blades at ""affordable"" costs."
4,"Cool Knife, Bad sheath","I love this knife, it is exactly as descripted and what makes it cool is that you can use it as a regular knife with a prety sharp edge and a thrower. It throws great and is well balanced and the black finish makes it look very cool. The sheath it comes with sucks on the other hand thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars. The belt that is supposed to hold the knife in place is to loose so it can be pulled right out when it is buckled. I would recommend this. Oh ya and the tip stayed straight after many many throws."
3,takes training or talent,I got one of these on the suggestion of friends. I can not hit anything. Somehow the knife hits the target backwards. I can not figure out if it is my throw or the knife. I guess my throw. Anyway it is a bit expensive if I can not use it. I guess I will see if I can find a class.
2,Awesome pry bar with an edge,"The True Flight Thrower is thick, heavy and comes with a decent edge. It will not stick in my wood target no matter how hard or how precise I throw it. The tip is very thick and will hold up to the abuse but it's too thick to stick in dry wood. It would work great on a cross cut target of soft wood like cypress or white pine. My kiln dried yellow pine target just rejects it and throws it to the ground. Works great on cardboard. Overall, its a tough piece of steel but needs the proper target medium to enjoy."
5,Very Durable,"Length:: 0:17 MinsBefore purchasing this item, I tended to buy cheaper, lower quality items so I wouldn't waste money when I broke them. After finally purchasing this knife, I realize I had the wrong approach. This knife is so much more durable and flies better than any other knife I have. I throw knives in the garage a lot, and when I miss (which I would like to deny happens), the point often lands right on the concrete. While this breaks the tips off of other blades, the True Flight is ready for more throws. Now my concern is damage to the floor."
5,WOW! One badass throwing blade..,"In the case of most thrown knives, I would agree that using them for self-defense is a great way of handing your opponent a weapon..not so this hefty mutha.Hit 'em with the haft and your gonna bring pain..hit 'em with the point and they won't be throwing it back at you anytime soon.:)The balance is near perfect, the blade is durable enough to take a LOT of abuse and poor throws, and the dang thing weighs enough that it's stupid-easy to fully penetrate 1"" pine target boards with a half-inch of point coming thru the other side.."
5,Perfect,"High quality, razor sharp, and balanced.The price for a cold steel knife is what sold me...Its a great tool and I have been using it almost every day since the day I bought it"
4,"little loud, nice and heavy","these are good, a bit hyped up i think, when they smack the board its a big thud, but wil last and take thousands of throws"
4,Love the G and C strings,"This is the first time I've tried Helicore Strings. The two lower strings have a warm, full sound and respond quickly. However, the A string is so thin that I literally cut my finger on it! It sounds thin and wirey. The D string is somewhat better. The next time I need strings I will purchase the C and G Helicore only."
4,Good strings,Good strings at a great price. My daughter is a beginner and these were the strings recommended by her cello instructor. They were $30 cheaper here than in the store.
3,Book seems dated,"I have read several of the books out on this topic and find this one to be pretty dated. While some of the information is still valid (and probably always will be), for my money and time I found other, more current books, to be more helpful. Especially lacking in this book is any research that supports the authors opinions. Plus, the advice seems too general to be much help.I guess there is a reason it was out of print for so long."
1,What?,"I can not believe this book received any good reviews. It is horrible. Sergio needs to learn the term, ""for example"". He assumes the reader is quite familiar with his notation without any explanation. I am a graduate student in electrical engineering and I am mystified by his notations. If he had just given a few explanations of his notations, this may have been a decent book."
2,Plastic guiro,This is a plastic toy version of a guiro. I guess it would be fine as a toy for a toddler but if you want something that makes sounds anything like a real guiro you will likely be disappointed.
5,"Nicely made, but do not expect real instrument-like sound.","Made in Israel, nice and durable plastic. But since this is a toy, do not expect real instrument sound from it."
3,half and half,"This item was so inexpensive that I purchased two. One is working quite well, and I am happy with it. The other did not work for 24 hours. I plugged it in Friday night, and it was dead on Saturday morning. I'm glad that I had two so that I could switch and see which part of the unit was dead (the console or the wiring). The console was the defunct part. Now I have to go though the hell of returning to Amazon.Suggestion: get two just in case. The working one does work well."
1,"Item is not working, I will email the seller on Monday","On the 12/21/08 the unit quit working (only 1 month of use). I checked the power source which is ok, the converter light is green but unit light not working. Cannot hear unit running. checked filter and water tank, nothing. I will call seller on 12/29/08. Needless to say I am not a happy customer."
1,Horrible Product,My dehumidifier worked at first but when I emptied it a second time it never cut back on and it hasn't worked since. I am very disappointed with the product and I recommend that no one buy this.
4,mini-dehumidifier rating,"The Amcor MD250 Mini Dehumidifier was received promptly within the allotted time period, in the original packaging and in new condition. I, the buyer, didn't research the product well enough thinking it would be somewhat bigger than it was but irregardless of that aspect it works well enough, the color is something other than the usual drab white of most appliances (silver), and it runs with minimal noise. It has built into it, unlike a bigger model I had before, an air ionizer too. That additional element makes it a good buy for the money. This product was built for and meant for small rooms and will keep the air from becoming too damp (and so creating mildew and mold) and will freshen the air, allowing for cleaner air. All in all I am happy with this find and buy and the professionalism of the seller."
1,Piece of C**p.,"I purchased this late in February 2008 specifically for the small space that they say it is made for. Mine happens to be in a storage closet where I keep some equipment and artwork that I want to remain dry (obviously). It was installed end of February or early March and started making noise last week- by Friday it stopped completely. No motor, no lights, nothing. Trying to get anyone in customer service has proven to be a nightmare, and finally when I did, she took my information and said someone would get back to me within 3 days. 3 days has passed and now I cannot seem to get anyone again to even pick up!!! I'll see if Amazon will credit me and deal with their own vendor!!! This shouldn't be sold at all."
2,last only 6 months or less,"I have purchased 4 of them. They work great, while they last. Never works for 12 months. Per the manafacture box states to contact them directly, but them dont call back. Too bad."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"The only reason I am giving this product 1 star is because apparently I can't submit a zero-star review. I ordered this item in August and in less than a month it stopped working. So I ordered a replacement in September and it lasted just over 1 month. Thank goodness for Amazon's amazing customer service & return policy! I have included a link for another dehumidifier that I had used for well over a year, if not 2. When that one eventually broke I tried to save $5 and try a different one... what a huge mistake! Needless to say I will go back to this one: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H0ZDD2"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"Do not buy this product, you can read the other reviews but they are all about the same. basically, this thing is garbage and only works for about a month before the problems start. I have had it for a month, and it simply stopped working. The light would not come on at all, complete failure. apparently this is a common thing for this product. All i know id that if it is made by Amcor, its probably a worthless piece of s**t..."
1,Junk product + junk support = Amcor MD250,"Worked great for a few months, then it stopped working. Their warranty support was awful: useless website, and their phone number wouldn't connect you to a human being.I wrote them a ""never buying your products again"" letter and they eventually sent a new one. The replacement lasted 6 weeks until it stopped working just like the last one.Junk product, junk support. Never again buying another Amcor product."
3,works well,"This hair dryer has 3 different settings to dry your hair, i don't seem to notice a difference on any of the settings- I think its more of a light show than anything. It does get my hair dry pretty fast. The only negative that I have noticed about this dryer is that the back of the hair dryer clogs up with lint quite often and it did not come with a filter to help block that out- easy fix by using a hand held vacuum cleaner to get the lint out."
3,Works - but I don't recommend it.,"This hairdryer is bigger and heavier than I expected. I agree with the other reviewer, the buttons are awkward, and are easily changed during the drying process - annoying. I did not have the problem with speed the other reviewer did, thankfully. I still use it, but do not love it, and would not recommend it to my friends. Not because of defects, or because it does not do what it claims, but because it is an awkward design..very flawed."
4,Nice Blowdryer,Very good product..The only reason I am giving it 4 stars it is because it is on the bulky side...
3,Little bit heavy & big when compared with regular compact,"Pros:over all seems good with many options (+,- ions, fast,slow, hotter)for $25.Cons:Can't fold the handle to just pack or to make compact. So, its slightly bigger, don't expect this is like a micro kind of. Bit heavy than normal dryers.May be its usual for such kind of dryers."
4,Great hairdryer,"I bough this as a gold box deal couple months ago. I must say I'm really satisfied with my purchase.I use mostly the negative ion because I want to dry my hair as fast as possible in the morning. It definitly dry my hair faster than my old hair Dryer. It is also light for its size.My only complain would be the cold hair button is hard to press and kept press when needed. But other than that, it works fine and allows me a couple more minute of sleep in the morning."
5,A must for New Mexico and Southern Colorado Genealogy,Reviewer: A reader from Southern Colorado - Northern New Mexico. An excellent aid for those of us researching our family roots in New Mexico. This book does much to explain and date the migration of our Hispanic/Indian ancestors in and from the Rio Grande Valley during the past 400 years.
3,good overview of bellydancing,"This was a beautiful-looking book, though smaller in size than I had anticipated (not coffee-table sized but a smallish square paperback). It's pretty cursory in its review of culture and costume. Lots of details on things like instruments and drum patterns (in fact, a bit too much detail). I was expecting more clear delineations between the different styles of dress per culture, so I was a bit disappointed in that area. And I have to echo what another reviewer said, that the print is a little hard to read because of the choices in font and background colors in places."
4,fairly useful and adequately written,"First of all, this book is quite attractive in its design and artistic pictures. There are various information on the bellydance in this book which is very nice, especially the information on musical instruments and the types of different bellydance. However, I don't think this one book can cover everything about the bellydance. If you want a small, cute, simple, convenient guide book that you can carry everywhere and use as a bellydance dictionary, then this would do you a good job. If you want a serious encyclopedia of bellydance, then try other books.*Overall, I like this book. This book won't disappoint you, but there's no guarantee that you will be satisfied.."
3,"Good book, lousy printing","This book is full of great information on the origins of belly dance, dance styles, moves and costuming however....it's virtually impossible to read the wealth of material contained on it's pages thanks to the use of dark and pastel colored photographs and patterns as a background for the print!! (Print which also wildly varies in color and sometimes all but disappears in the background altogether.) It's a real shame that the editors didn't take that problem in consideration at the time of publication because they have made an otherwise wonderful little book very difficult to enjoy."
3,enjoyable coffee table book,"It's by no means a text on belly dancing. But GREAT photos and little tidbits here and there on facts. I did learn some new things (I had a great bellydance teacher and learned a lot from her, but even so I find that this book also taught me something new...so that says something). By the way, it's a small book. FYI."
4,Simple Yet Useful,"This is a little booklet, nicely packaged in quality papers. At first I found it quite simple and might not be as comprehensive as I expect. Though the book does not have huge volume, it is precisely written with some basic facts and history about belly dancing. I particularly love the part which it introduces different kinds of musical instrument and rhythem used in belly dancing. The materials are easy to understand, clearly presented but it provides what I expect to know. A practical guide for belly dance lovers."
3,Nice booklet..... but just a booklet,"This is not a book its a booklet. The info is basic nice and organized.I would have expected a lot more in terms of presentation, quality of the images and size."
4,Lavish pictures and concise introductory information,"A lovely book for your very first purchase in this area. The author is an Australian of Middle Eastern background who has now moved to Egypt, so it is obvious she loves her subject. Such a pretty book in addition to being a good read. A great gift if you know someone who is just starting classes, or if you want to encourage them to!!"
2,"Product probably good, Seller STINKS!","Product probably good, Seller STINKS! Purchased item from this seller but they are uncommunicative and ""loose"" about shipment. Caveat Emptor!"
2,Shipping destruction,The cd itself sounds fine but the case was destroyed. I presume this happened in shipping but it was as if someone stomped it wearing very heavy boots. Needless to say the case is useless.
1,Waste Of Money,"This product doesn't even rate ONE star.I purchased this product for our Boardroom. The price threw me but, our CEO and top management get presentations in that boardroom from VIPs around the world.So imagine my suprise, when the cursor dropped down to the bottom of the screen and would not rise back up until putting the mouse down on the table again.Tech supports big solution: REBOOT the PC.For the same $$$$$, you can buy 3 Logitech mice and throw 2 away because they just plain work."
5,Tan towels,As always this is a great product.Have uesd for many years. I personally prefer the tan towel plus over classic.No streaking at all and so easy to use. It is worth the price...i only use it once in a while.
5,Tan towels,I liked this product a lot. It looks natural and subtle. Great for winter use for chest face and arms
2,Poor results!,I hardly noticed any difference after using these towels. So tanning with them seems a waste a time. I will try again but not at all satisfied.
3,Not an economy issue,"Chabrier was an original and scintillating composer, whose operatic reputation rests on THE KING DESPITE HIMSELF (Le roi magre lui), a dazzling work. THE STAR is really an operetta, an opera comique in the double sense of a comic opera and a composition with large sections of spoken dialogue. It is charming and entertaining, but not captivating.I rushed to buy this version, on sale, fearing that it was an economy issue SANS libretto. I was correct, and suffer grievously. If a French text were included, I would have been content.In general I eschew compositions with text that is not included. I find the web option clumsy. To add insult to injury, I followed instructions and after an hour surrendered: I could not find the text."
5,Great state history,"I purchased and read this book before heading to graduate school in Pennsylvania; I knew very little about the state other than the bare details, and I prefer to possess a certain ""sense"" of a place before living there. This book satisfied that desire and more; it provided a great insight into the historical movements that are common to many states, while covering Pennsylvania's history from the times of indigenous habitation to the 21st Century challenges and opportunities. An engaging and easy read for anybody looking for a great overview of the Keystone State's rich history and culture."
3,HIS 345,"I think this book is a difficult read. I do however find some chapters more interesting than others, but I'm sure that is personal preference. I find myself needing to reference the dictionary at least 15 times each chapter. I was hoping to find it in audio form as I thought that my be helpful for me. No luck so far."
5,"One word to describe this book, FANTASTIC!","This book is filled with history, romance, and adventure on the high seas! Alexa and Adam were made for each other! Adam Foxworth has nothing on his mind but exacting revenge on his enemy. But what Adam doesn't count on is falling in love with his enemies daughter. This is a MUST read book!"
1,This is one bad book,"Even in the realm of the ""bodice ripper"" there's a line between ""romance"" and ""rape,"" and Ms. Mason has crossed that line. A ""romance"" involves an improbable match, developing into love and triumphing over great odds. What we have in Ms. Mason's heavy-handed tale, however, is a brutish ""hero"" repeatedly forcing himself upon our heroine, who, lacking any self-respect (or instruction in battered woman's syndrome, apparently), promptly and improbably falls in love with him.The ""love story"" of this book isn't about ""romance"" or even ""seduction;"" it's about conquest and humiliation. It's ugly in its complete lack of either sensitivity or subtlety. Throw in some transparent ""twists"" and drag the story out interminably, and there you have ""My Lady Vixen.""Where this book isn't simply poorly written and silly, it's disturbing."
4,A perfect view of millenial America,"I found that this book captured near perfectly the sense of hyper-reality and unease that grips our civilization at the close of the millenium. With a series of at-first seemingly disconnected images, Dery weaves together a coherent and prismatic image of what America means in an age when meaning is equated with mere image. This is an author who is a journalist in the highest sense of the word, bringing the reader to a fresh understanding of the common everyday world which surrounds us all.I whole-heartedly recommend this work."
2,"Lots to say, nothing new.","Mark Dery's writing style makes my mind wander and fails to pull me in. He mentions something about everything, from Ace Ventura's anal speech to the burning of Waco. ""The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink"" gives short insight into life's odd episodes, freak shows, and moments of insanity but misses out on making a statement worthy of reaction. As I read, I kept thinking, ""yes, I know, so what?"" Give me something, anything. I guess was expecting more."
3,Weak but more substance than TV,"Are books better than television. Yes. Even better than HBO/SHOWTIME but books like this skirt the edge of that maxim. This 4 part series has all the parts of a novel. Character development, plot movement and a mystery of sorts are all there. It is a weak series that I did enjoy reading, in no small part because I met our hero in the Fearless series.I suspect that it is the ability to imagine that makes it better than the Telly."
5,Great book.,"When I was old enough to reach the green felt, my father put a pool cue in my hand and taught me how to play pool. It's been an obsession ever since. Such is true to Fast Eddie.This book picks up many years after The Hustler and Eddie is at a place in his life where he seems to have lost control again. It was great seeing Minnesota Fats and Eddie as friends later in life, and Tevis does a great job showing us how legends are created and marketers try to make a fast dollar off of them. (This is not a recurring theme in the book, but just an exploitation in the beginning.)My favorite point is when Eddie is playing a friendly game with an acquaintance who has no idea of Eddie's background. The acquaintance brags about the mastery of pool in his younger days, and how he was known as ""the 'Fast' Eddie"" of his college campus."
5,Great Slipcover,"I washed it in hot water, dried it, threw it on the sofa and tucked it into the crevices. It's wonderful! It has a very relaxing, inviting, and natural look to it. It does shrink quite a bit when washed, but I think with a little ironing it will get a little more length back again."
4,using this as a floor for a tent,"This makes a NICE floor for our tent. With a tarp underneath and this inside, the tent floor lasts longer. But this is also nice to walk on as well as protecting the tent floor.It's a bit of a pain to clean, especially if you camp on a beach so it gets filled with sand. I ended up hanging it on a clothesline and hosing it off, then letting it dry before storing.I'm pleased with my purchase for this unusual application."
3,It Was Just Okay to Me!!!,"This book started off really good, but towards the middle and ending, I couldn't wait until it was over. It just became boring and unrealistic. Especially the scene with her friend Morgan; nobody told Harlem what happened to her but she was forced to find out because she was smart talking the cop? That was silly. Also, one minute her mother was the biggest crackhead and the next minute she was Saint Mary. Where was the transition from creackhead to Saint Mary? Storyline wasn't quite developed all the way through.Overall, not a horrible book, but not the greatest!!!Overall rating: 3.0"
4,A decent read worth reading,"This was a very decent read,I feel as though the author is a very talented writer and put alot of emmotion into this story.I connected to the main character very well and I felt her pain and struggles.The book had quite a few errors and I could have sworn the whole""Harlem knew York"" phrase was used in another book I once read.Other than that I enjoyed the story."
2,Not worth it!,I'm a true reader.....I read over 20 books a week....Take my word for it....Borrow it don't buy it....This book was a diappointment....
5,"Joy, you truly ruled the world!","Joy, I truly enjoyed your novel; this was an amazing book that I could not put down. Joy's writing style is off the hook. I loved Harlem's strength throughout everything she had been through. Keep up the good work, Lady and I hope to see many more from you soon!- Debbie; Bowie, Maryland"
4,Harlem's World,"Imagine yourself as a little girl watching the world around you go from happy to sad to miserable. Without her mother's smile, her daddy's embrace and her little brother's giggles, Harlem soon realizes that she has to learn the art of survival. Tossed from bad to situation to another bad situation, Harlem grates into her soul that it is her against the world.After years of holding in her anger and tears she is finally on top with her best friend Morgan by her side. As the bell chimes and the door opens, Harlem finds herself introduced to yet another situation, Jazzy and York. Jazzy is smoother than anyone she's ever known and York has that boldness that she is attracted to. Will Harlem's decision either make or break her?4.5"
5,You did your thang on this one Joy,"I read this book in four hours!!! Even though I woke up late the next morning from being up half the night reading If I Ruled the World, it was worth it. The plot was fast-paced, and I could definitely identify with Harlem. Don't sleep on this one readers!!!! I can't wait to read more from this excellent author."
3,"It's okay, but not another coldest winter ever!","I bought this book because of all the great reviews and comparsion to The Coldest Winter Ever. It's anything but. It was a good read and I enjoyed the characters. Harlem was a strong woman. I would recommend you buying it, but don't expect dynamite like The coldest winter ever."
3,Yet another Sophisticated Beggar repackaging,"This is a repackaged version of Roy's first album, Sophisticated Beggar. Some nice songs, but his style was still developing and his later albums are much better."
3,Setup was different,I found the setup to be the most difficult part of the entire process. Playing DVD's was easy.
2,User Unfriendly,"Simply put, this DVD/VCR combo is very difficult to use even for a fairly savy person like myself. Without the manual you are lost, and the most annoying thing about this model is the very noisy fan that runs incessantly even when the machine is off! I had to put it on a AC socket on/off switch."
2,Not worth your time,"I have 3 complaints about this machine: No fast forward feature for the DVD player, takes too long to start up, the clock always runs fast.Our biggest complaint is that there is no fast forward feature for the DVD player. You are allowed to skip chapters, but once in a chapter you can not fast forward or rewind. This is very annoying.Our second complaint is that it takes forever to initially start up. It is so slow! You can't just turn it on and record, you have to let the maching boot itself up first. And it is noisy.Our last complaint is that regardless of how many times you reset the clock, it will always run fast. We've given up on it at this point.I agree with the other review that says the machine is somewhat difficult to run. You definately have to read the manual through to figure it out.This machine will play both DVD's and Tapes, but it is more hassel then it it worth. I wish I would have researched this before I bought it, it was an impulse buy."
3,practical not perfect,"This mirror has been around a few years. The negative comments are true. It breaks to easily, it jiggles too much, but it is inexpensive, and you can easily put it on to ride, take it off to transport or do repairs. It has a good wide field of view which I like and having it on the brake post means I don't have to look down to view. The drop end mirrors are ok, but not easy on/off and you do look down if you are riding in traffic. Out in the country where I might drop down in position the bar ends are fine, but in town where I am looking all around for danger I like this Blackburn road mirror. I have broken two, well actually the wind blew my bike over once, and my wife knocked my bike over in the garage once, but I could replace it in seconds. One caution, make certain the strap does not impede the brake lever shifters moving side ways. I think the company could make the plastic arm stronger and the ring to tighten the adjustment work better. Maybe they will read the reviews."
4,Best option for placement on handlebar with bar-end shifters,"I am pleased with this mirror. I have few placement options for a mirror due to bar end shifters and a taper to the top of my handlebars. Fits on the side of my brake grip, in the only location where it does not get in the way of any of my hand positioning options. Yes it sticks out from the bike, but that puts it in the right location to get a good view behind you. The mirror is easily removed via the velcro strap. The horizontal width of the mirror is better than a round shape in order to give you a good view of the width of the road behind you. The only inconvenience of this mirror is there is a bit too much vibration; let's you see cars and your partners behind you, but not crystal clear due to the shaking. I have bought/tried many different options for my configuration and this is the best I have found."
2,Vibrates Too Much,Tried this on my road bike with 9 speed Shimano 105 shifters and ended up returning it and going back to my Take A Look glasses mounted mirror. The pivoting mechanism is too loose. The mirror never stayed in place when adjusted and allowed the mirror to vibrate too much to see anything behind you. This thing is the least dorky looking brake hood mounted mirror I've seen but it just didn't work for me.
1,Not Practical,Velcro does not hold - I needed to use steel clamp to secure the mirror.Mirror easily detaches and falls off the handle. Almost lost it twice.As noted in other reviews - vibration is a big problem.
2,"Great concept, poor execution","The mirror attaches easily to the brake hood and is positioned correctly for quick glances into the mirror. In many ways I prefer that position over a mirror mounted on the helmet or the glasses.Unfortunately, the mount itself is made from relatively soft plastic which leads to vibrations even on smooth roads. The joint for adjusting the mirror loosens too quickly so that readjustment is needed from time to time.Overall, I still love the concept but I removed the mirror from my bike again because in practice this mirror is not very useful. However, I am using this mirror as a starting point for building something sturdier using an aluminum mount."
2,Not happy,"This mirror, although the position is good when riding, is not practical. I was constantly trying to avoid hitting the mirror against anything such as a wall, pole or anything else. This is because it sticks out so much from the handlebars. You cannot flip your bike upside down to work on it with this mirror attached.There is road vibration also. It takes a long time to figure out what is going on in the mirror. For example, at night there may be three cars behind you. But because of the vibration, it looks like 6 cars because what you see is 12 bouncing lights but it is really 6 bouncing lights from three cars with two headlights each.Because of the optical curve, objects also appear different than in real life. So it is also hard to perceive depth. I returned mine and have a glasses mirror that works much better.The reason I give it two stars is if you cannot wear a helmet or glasses mirror, then this mirror is better than riding unsafely with no mirror at all."
1,Blackburn mirror a blur,"I used the Blackburn Brakehood mirror for one ride. As stated is other review, I could not see a thing until I was almost at a stop or riding on a road that was as smooth as glass.I think the plastic is waaaay to thin and flexible. The mirror wobbled all over the place. I had the velcro pulled until it was ripping and it was still shaking all over. I returned it the same week. I am still searching for the old style Rhode Gear version that was made out of aluminum and was GREAT. Probably in the history books though.I am a road rider and ride in the 14-18mph range. Maybe it would work better for the people who just ride around their neighborhood or to the ice cream shop and don't go over a few mph and have smooth roads(like anyone has that anymore) I can't say."
3,A promising band with room for improvement.,"It's pleasant, competent techno-rock. Good enough for the college circuit but the songwriting is too 80s-sounding and the vocals too ordinary to justify the rising star hype. There aren't any bad songs, and particularly ""Cuerpos Ambiguos"" and ""Esta Vez"" show a penchant for capable if not irresistible pop hooks. Even if the material isn't strong enough to make ""Ilumina"" a classic, it's still great background music.By far the best tracks are remixes. Terrestre gives an otherworldly Nortec feel to ""Endora'o"" (is a woman singing or has Jamie Perlman's voice just been processed to sound that way?) and Kinky produces a complex, layered acid jazz mix of ""Diablo."""
2,no difference,"I have tried this shampoo and conditioner on several different occasions throughout the years, hoping it would live up to how it is marketed. While it smells good and my hair does feel clean, I noticed absolutely no enhanced volume using these products. I gave it 2 stars because it at least cleaned my hair. I am skeptical about trying the real expensive stuff (Kerastase, Phyto); they either seem to work for some (are the reviews legit or by someone who works for the company???) or not at all and a sheer waste of $$$. It would be nice if these manufacturers would offer a free sample to prove what they promote is actually true, since they claim results can be seen after one use. I guess I will be forever hunting for that ""magic"" volumizing shampoo that actually does what it should!"
5,a masterpiece,"Recommended to everyone who would like to judge if zoran dukic is one of the world's top guitar performers. (Yes, he is) Pay special attention to the Jose Sonata !"
1,Do any of them work?,My first one died after 1 week. The second one died after 1 day. Trying to get my money back from seller. Verified that it is not user error and is in fact faulty harddrive.
3,Helpful in describing these issues -- needs some solutions,"As a new mother, this book helped me understand some of the issues I grapple with. The section on identifying burn-out was especially valuable. The book wasn't quite as prescriptive as I would have liked -- not as many suggestions on how to prevent or heal the issues raised. But I still found it a very worthwhile read."
2,Watch out for expiration dates!,"I ordered a package of two 5 oz tubes of this suntan lotion, which I really like. It never occurred to me that they would both expire in 6 months at the end of this year. I may use one tube by that time, but not two. Anyway, beware of this situation, especially when it's a twofer deal!"
4,The Book Of Hope,"I have found this book to be a great tool for evangelism. I really like the translation which is much clearer for everyone except the few that have been taught, Paul only used the KJV. May God bless the use of this and all books in His name."
