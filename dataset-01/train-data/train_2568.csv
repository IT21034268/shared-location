4,did the trick,dogs love this thing. especially with peanut butter! sure helps with my dogs growing teeth! works out great for price
3,Short term chewing,Dog likes it but it is very easy for her to get all the treat out. I wish it lasted longer
4,Good enough,"Our puppy liked this well enough, and it was somewhat handy for pills, but she likes this the least of all the Kong products she has."
2,My puppy could care less for it,"Maybe my puppy is just lazy. Got the puppy kong for my 8 wk old puppy and thought that he would love it. Nope, if he cannot get the treat out in under 30 seconds, he loses interest. I have smeared peanut butter on the inside and put some of his kibbles in there. Because the kibbles are stuck to the peanut butter, it doesn't really come out. Instead of chewing and working for the food, he just gives up. If there is no treats in there, he doesn't even play with it. I also think that I underestimated how big he was growing. The puppy size kong doesn't really fit a whole lot of kibbles and also I think his mouth is too big to really get in the kong to get the food out. I've contemplated on getting a classic kong but because of the experience, I do not know whether I really want to spend money on something he may still not care for. So sorry, kong didn't work for my dog."
1,Poor,This item was listed as blue and I received a pink one. Of course the (boy) puppy could care less about the color; our seven year old son wasdisappointed. A color choice should be available. Our puppy is only seven weeks old and doesn't show alot of inerest yet.
2,Eh,"I've never had a dog that cared about Kongs. This is small, so any treat I put inside is either too small and falls right out, or too big and the puppy can't get it out. I'm over trying to get my dogs to like Kongs."
3,Over Rated Toy,I had heard rave reviews from friends with small dogs that this was THE toy to get so we purchased the Kong Puppy (blue) when our Jack/Chi mix first started teething. In just a couple of weeks with limited use (she wasn't that into it)the rubber started chipping off in chunks around the hole and we had to toss it. Not sure if we just had a defective one or not but between that and lack of long term interest I will not purchase another KONG toy of this or similar models.
2,not good.,"I bought this for my Maltese, he is 6 years old because so many place recommend it and my dog just chewed my shoes. At first I was like o no, I bought the wrong thing, its for puppy! So I thought I would give it a try if he is interested then i will buy the adult one. I did everything they recommend such as put food in there, put peanut butter, put treats. My dog just doesn't like it. He completely ignore the toy, its actually his least favorite toy. Maybe bigger dogs like kong, i dont know..."
3,Too slow for its fifty minutes,"Anyone more than remotely familiar with Frankenstein and the mythos behind it (the true reanimation experiments; the famous ""contest"" between Byron, Polidori and the Shelleys, etc) will find familiar ground in this almost-hour-long documentary chronicling the life and times of Mary Shelley. Occasionally, the presentation stops short of scandalous--there are a few references to the Shelleys' views on ""free love"" but nothing concrente. But overall, the documentary drags, with very little commentary, too much panning on artwork, and not enough detail about the ""real life"" experiments Mary Shelley was supposedly influenced by. There is also no detail on Shelley's numerous miscarriages, which has also been postulated as a source of pathos for her creature's sad story."
3,improperly labelled,"This part is not for the model 1320 as noted, this is an entire assembley and the 1320 is just a drawer. The drawer in it does not even fit with that model. The correct replacement drawer for a 1320Brand NameHPModel numberHPM1654B-002AAManufacturer Part NumberRC1-3483"
5,Even better than the book!,The Experimental Guide book is a must have companion book for anyone who has read the Celestine Prophecy.
4,celestine expirencial guide,This book was used and it was underlined in places ....now for me who underlines and highlights I liked it that way and felt somewhat of a kinship with this seller. I was happy
1,contrived claptrap preying on the weak minded,"I read this to understand what had tipped an acquaintance over the edge. This attempts to guide lost souls towards a new way of thinking, but in fact provides justification for alienating those you know/love in the event that they dont see the light in the way that you do. The last third of the book is a poorly disguised manifesto for Mr Redfield's chosen 'church' of thought, and he is guilty of promising assistance, but is in fact providing a reason for self destructive people to alienate themselves further. He has claimed in the past this is merely a novel, but only those weak enough to be taken in by the book are fooled by this, shame on you, you have ruined more lives than you have saved."
5,Birthday gift for my Dad,"My Dad is the hardest man in the world to buy gifts for, but he loves this DVD and continues to laugh each time he watches it."
4,"If you're a Ray Stevens fan, you'll love it.","I bought this for my husband who loves Ray Stevens. He loves this collection, and even discovered a few videos he'd never seen before. So, if you like Ray Stevens you like this."
5,"if you like ray, you'll like this","i bought this to add to my ray stevens video collection. you cant beat these old comedy videos, he is a big goofball and hilarious to watch. good purchase."
1,Get Serious Ray Stephens,th tape was not good must have been hot at some time as the tape was stuck in some places and made for bad vidio the case it came in was un opened so i guess it was just old and not kept in a very good place i think the vender might wont to check his or her stock Lamar
1,bad,"I never received my video collection from amazon or who ever amazon was to get it from. I have waited for two months for it. I have sent amazon all the information they wanted to see were it was. NOTHING from any one. Its called, take the money and run. So how good is this video. Who the hell knows. I don't think I can trust amazon any more. So there's my review.Just thought I would share my opinion. Big Al"
1,OUTDATED,"The information in this book is not only outdated, it is extremely repetitive. It was a required book for school, so I will leave it at that, other than please do not waste your time and money."
1,Too Bad Zero Stars is not an option...,"I don't know which civil war this book refers to, but it certainly is not our American Civil War! I do not know where the author got all this information, but 99.44% is incorrect and a lot is outright laughable. If you want your children to see what people wore during the Civil War, get one of Juanita Leisch's excellent books."
3,What people wore during the civil war,It was not exactly what I expected. Too less pages ;-) Nice pictures and the kind of book I wanted - but unfortunately much too short
5,OORAH!,I LOVE this movie! I was in the Marine Corps for several years. This movie made me want to put my uniform back on and run down to the recruiters office. It tells such an awesome story about the struggles that the military members struggle with. I definately will be purchasing this movie!!
4,Good movie,Wasn't sure how good this would be but I thought this movie was pretty good. I liked how it ended too.
5,About Damn Time!,"In 1980 I knew Tad Boomer, an air force sergent who 'came out' on the steps of the capital building in Denver Colorado. I ran into him six months later, and he was a destroyed man.We can not afford to forget our history, if for any other reason than that 'culture' is always only one generation thick.Because we enjoy civil liberties now does not mean we will enjoy them tomorow. Resting on our acomplishments of today only invites the bigots of tomorow to grow strong, and every generation has it's bigots. Think about it.I loved this movie-watch it!"
2,Maybe a good movie for the GLTB community; but maybe not to the straight camp,"This movie would certainly resonate with the GLTB community, but many straight people like me may be quite a bit less thrilled."
3,"Story was okay, but expected more...","Movie overall wasn't terrible, but certainly wasn't what it seemed it would be from the preview and title. Just expected better. Would probably do the digital download next time instead."
3,Not What I Expected,"A Marine Story is a story about a married lesbian enlisted in the Marines who faces adversity due to the choices she has made, namely the failure to conceal her sexual orientation. The film does draw you in, is well paced and holds your attention (3 stars for production), but I can't in good conscience recommend it. Though it is Not Rated (NR), a more detailed breef summary needs to be included in the Amazon description so an informed decision can be made prior to its potential viewing, due to sexual content. This movie may be seen as offensive to people who hold to traditional marriage, lifestyle, and objective moral values which are based upon Biblical concepts."
1,Biased film,That attempts to depict gays in the military as a good thing when it isn't.I'm sorry that the lady had to deal with negative emotions in life but that doesn't justify her decisions.
4,Worth the time.....,"Wow! I almost didn't watch it being an Air Force guy, LOL! Butit is well done. And Ms. Weber wow as attractive as they get!Anyone knows if she is single? LOL!"
4,I like it - well done.,I liked the film and thought it was well done - not over the top and not beating the issue to death. The acting in general was very good and it film itself kept me engaged throughout.
4,Solid watch,"I have owned this watch for about three years, and love it. It is solid, heavy, and large, but doesn't look obnoxiously huge on the wrist.My only complaint is the chronograph version of this watch has a plexiglass crystal and the non-chrono version comes with a sapphire crystal, and I've found that I scratch the plexi crystal A LOT. 5 minutes with some brasso and a soft towel and it looks great again but it is annoying.I had the misfortune of submerging mine with the crown pulled, getting the movement wet, and had to have it serviced. It was perfect before it was serviced and is perfect still, 2 years after service.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this watch to anyone."
4,Very cool watch,"Very cool watch. Owned by a friend of mine, it's a constant eye catcher that never fails to impress."
2,BABY PIZZA SLICE COSTUME,"Although this item was absolutely ADORABLE, my 6 1/2 month old did not fit into it. Granted my baby is longer than normal babies of that age, he was squished in there. This is great for babies that are a little a shorter/smaller."
3,"Very pretty to look at, but practical?","I was somewhat disappointed as a current homeowner and builder of a new contemporary home, I (like many people) was trying to get ideas. This is more of a text book for architecture students, showing them the far reaches of art. Very little ideas could be had as far as conceptually and practicly speaking..."
4,Quick Change Secondary Spring Kit.,"If you own a Holley Carb with Vaccuum Secondaries, there is no way that you can go without this product. I think most new Holley carbs already come with this as an added feature but for all the others that are using older models or rebuilt units, this is a great kit to have. This kit will allow you to change how quick the secondaries open without removing the whole secondary Diaphram Unit from the base of the carb to get to the spring."
5,One of the top three best English-language books on the GSD,"There are few men in North America who know as much about the German Shepherd than Fred Lanting. He shares with the reader his amazing breadth of experience and in most lucid, engaging and elegant prose touches upon virtually all the issues connected with the world's most popular breed. From the genetic origins and evolution of the standard to the health concerns and breeding tips, ""Total GSD"" has it all. Together with Susan Barwig's ""GSD Encyclopedia"" and Malcolm Willis' ""German Shepherd Dog: a genetic history"", it is an absolute ""must have"" item for any serious GSD fancier."
1,6 OUT OF 100 ORIGINAL HITS,"I WISH I HAD READ THE BOTTOM OF THE JEWEL CASES BEFORE I WASTED MY TIME LISTENING TOTHESE FIVE CDS (THEY NOTED WITH AN ASTERISK WHICH SONGS WERE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS)LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO ENJOY. PERHAPS SOMEONE WHO HADN'T HEARD THESE SONGSIN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM COULD ENJOY THESE, I CERTAINLY DID NOT (WITH THE EXCEPTIONSOF 5 of the 6 ORIGINAL SONGS THAT I DID LIKE. WITH ""JINGLE JANGLE"" BY THE ARCHIES NOTMAKING THE CUT). UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT APPEARED TO GOOD TO BE TRUE, WAS EXACTLYTHAT."
2,not what i expected,"there are a lot of writings in this book, and a lot of other's art, but as far as francis bacon goes, if you want a book of his works, this is not a good book to get. the majority of the images are of all kinds of artists that they talk about in contrast with bacon's work. i was disappointed as well to the images they chose of bacon's work. not among my favorite at all. its a well made book, but not what i wanted, and now will have to buy another book souly on francis bacon"
3,"a delightful Christmas book, full of inspiration","This now out of print book is a delight. The designs, which feature a variety of needle work techniques, are classic. The ""chelsea"" cat embroidered ornament is only one of several animal motifs worthy of reproduction. I would highly recommend this book even though it may be difficult to acquire. Erica Wilson never disappoints needle workers with her love and passion for the needle and her designs are classic and inspired."
4,Children's World,"A charming old book, filled with patterns for cross-stitch, embroidery, knitting and crochet. Great resource for patterns for ""characters"" like the muppets, winnie-the-pooh and holly hobbie."
1,Not for someone who crochets,This book is better for someone that does cross-stitch. I think I came across two crochet patterns and the same for the knitted ones. The Miss Piggy crochet pattern did not look like Miss Piggy. I didn't like that the crochet patterns were for finger puppets. I'm glad I did not pay more than a .40 cents for the book.
5,The Purple Book!,"This book made studying for the CHT exam a lot easier. It is easy to read and the authors are very responsive to people learning. They even answered questions I had before taking the exam. I am currently waiting on my test results but feel as if this book coupled with their CD-ROM ""Basics and Beyond"" that I was well prepared. Keeping my fingers crossed for my results soon!"
4,Lots of details,Complete handbook; very usefull for your examinations or to use for a teaching program.
5,IMPRESSED,I was very impressed when I first saw this film. It has the most realistic fight scenes I have ever seen in a kung fu film. The drunken style teacher is great and unique. If you love kun fu films get this. This is my favorite martial arts film thus far.
2,Hard to Understand,"The idea of a workbook format was good, but the concepts weren't explained well. I read sections over many times only to think, why didn't it just say that? It was a frustrating book to read. You could probably get the information faster and more painlessly from another book."
1,Not a book for a learner,"It was really hard to understand as a beginner like other reviewers. It makes you keep wonder why you don't follow and don't get much explanation. Well, the first chapter was okay as the introduction of regular expressions, but you get lost by the time you try to understand the excersises in chapter 2. Have you ever had the feeling that you feel like you want to go back again and again but you still goes far and far from the point? It is frustrationg. However, this kind of book could be useful for the teachers, definitely not for learners."
2,Difficult to understand,"I was very disappointed in this book. The descriptions and samples are very tough to follow, needing re-reading many times to follow. The Web site link does not work, so answers to the ""test your thinking"" sections cannot be found, nor the sample files. I suggest looking elsewhere and not get this book. It is just too painful to wade through, and is fond of making simple subjects much to obtuse."
5,Peter knows how to teach !,"I am an Oracle DBA. So far sed is enough for my file processing chores.Since I may need AWK later on, I am very interested in learing AWK now.Thanks a great deal, Peter ! I bought the book yesterday. It cutdown my fear about AWK. The way Peter shows AWK makes it easy to understand ! Many people are great programmers but to write a book, you MUST be a be a great TEACHER besides a great expert in this field. Pater is the right one.I had this in my mind on my way home:AWK is not hard , all you need is to have Peter as the teacher !Peter: What is your teaching background if you don't mind ?Prentice Hall: I love your 'interactive workbook', I bought almost half of all your titiles !Thank you for choosing excellent teachers to write those books ! This is an absolutelly successsful project! I hope to see more books like this !"
3,If you like Lovejoy like I do...,"The trouble with reading a series of books is trying to come up with something new to say with each succeeding book. If I stop enjoying the series, I'll stop reading the books, so I can't really complain about them. And I usually read them for enjoyment, not necessarily for any edification--and often the critical faculties will simply take a sabbatical while I'm in the midst of one.In this Lovejoy mystery, Lovejoy has to overcome his incredulation over the fact that someone might actually possess the Holy Grail, and by the time he does so, someone's croaked and our roguish antiques dealer may be next. The new antique (er, a bit of an oxymoron) stuff here is Lovejoy's apprentice selection process, how to fake a chair, and the joys of trying to date all the women in a small English village--eligible or not."
2,huh!,I do not understand: These are all great soundtracks but what is with there production. They are performed so Badly that I cringe when I listen to them. Giving this 2 stars is being generous!
5,Human Rights and the Global Marketplace,"This book is a resource on innovations in human rights that are presently sweeping the globe. In the midst of war, terrorism, torture, and other violations of civil and political rights, the book fouces squarely on the economic and social rights abuses that provide the context for other kinds of violations. It addresses issues - from the right to housing and food to the right to basic health care and public education. It also discusses the conflict between dictates of culture and religion and notions of equlaity and non-discrimination. This is an excellent book for university classes (both undergrad and post-grad) and for general readership as well."
3,Afro-brazilian inspiration....,"....and jazz instrumentation make this CD quite beautiful. If Jazz with a light and bouncy beat are your thing, than this is the disc for you!"
5,Gretchen and the Lost Carousel,This is my favorite childhood book. The illustrations are detailed and beautiful. The story is full of imagination and fantasy--enough to stimulate any child to dream.
1,the best of San Muguel de Allende,"Besides not liking the format of this book, I found things I definitly disagree with. I have traveled many times to Mexico and have always been told ""don't drink the water"" and ""don't eat from street venders"" if you want to keep your tummy in order. This book recomends you eat from street venders. I chose this as an example as it does not effect a place of business or restaurant but there were several I did not agree with...but that is personal opinion, the other is good health."
3,Not that great.,"I bought this text, then borrowed my friend's Dubin text. Haven't looked back at it once. The information is easy to comprehend but it is not a ""simplified approach"" in my opinion."
2,What color is the sky on your planet?,"I just watched Ms. Rowe-Finkbeiner on the Dennis Miller Show, and she trotted out the trusty ""women only make 76 cents for the same work a man gets paid a dollar."" This is another of the patently false statements used to divide men and women. It has clearly been debunked by multiple studies which block for age, marital and parental status, and years on the job. But even if the proof weren't there, I challenge you to put this to a simple logic test. Most businesses operate on a very thin margin. CEOs are given huge bonuses if they can improve the bottom line by 1-2%. What do you think they would get if they could save 24% on labor costs just by trading their male employees for female employees? If this canard were true, males would NEVER find work in this country."
1,Careful before you buy this,"I bought this scale in July 2002. Within days after it arrived, the battery showed a low battery indication. After several calls to the company, they sent me two new batteries (so much for the ""lifetime lithium batteries""). After 2 days the new batteries also showed a low battery indication. After several more calls to the company, they told me to send it back for repairs. A month later, they sent me a new scale. The problem is that the new scale is GRAY, not black like the one I returned. Our bathroom has a black marble floor, and so a gray scale is useless. It will either sit in the box, or I will sell it on E-bay."
1,Stomp on it . . . . .,. . . . . and it MIGHT work . . . and only on a hard floor surface. This does not work on a carpet and is difficult to activate evem on hardwood floor. It is back in the box . . . don't waste your time and money.
4,Pretty slick!,"I really like this scale. It looks great and is less bulky than other bathroom scales. And, for the time being, I've had no cause to complain about its accuracy.The glass surface is cool under your feet in the summer (I doubt this will be a year-round benefit) and the LED display is large and easy to read. While the scale has a unique look, its clean styling and simple design will blend well with the decor of just about any bathroom.Another thing I like about this item is that it has a nice heft to it -- it feels very sturdy."
1,Talk about a piece of junk...,It is very hard to get the scale to work as you have to stomp on it. The batteries died after 2 weeks. I taped a penny to it when I put it in the trash so that I could say that I threw something of value away.
4,Best digital scale I have used,Have had this scale for a year. Have been on the Atkins diet for about the last 3 months. The scale has worked well and shown that it is accurate and consistant. It is superior to my previous digital scale.
4,Deserving of a better fate,"Surprisingly, this release from late 2004 is already out of print. Perhaps the market is so saturated with unwanted disks that milk cartons have longer expiration dates. Jackie McLean was a prolific if not major recording artist who, above all, had an immediately identifiable sweet-sour sound. His true-blue fans would have no use for a miscellaneous collection such as this, and casual fans are probably few for this particular altoist.Nevertheless, this anthology represents vintage McLean from one of jazz' most fertile periods--the mid-fifties. Though I'm not the biggest fan of McLean's raw sounds, on this disk they're quite palatable for several reasons, among them the familiar repertory, the presence of two supreme bass players (Doug Watkins and Paul Chambers) and three always welcome horn players (Hank Mobley, Donald Byrd and Bill Hardman). Jackie's exchanges with the obscure altoist John Jenkins are also high points."
2,Argggg.....,"The first chapter is narrated by the ship and tells (briefly) the history of humanities discovery of it and how they came to be the sole rulers.After that it's pretty much poo-poo.First off, the human society on board the ship appears to be highly matriarchal. While this in itself shouldn't really matter, it detracts from the story line and appears to have no real function. If you're a bull-dyke, you might like this one. Add in the characters who are thousands of years old and yet go about their daily jobs endlessly and you start to see the problem. Major boredom.I'll add the caveat that I didn't finish the book; it was starting to feel like I was having my teeth pulled. Maybe you'll fare better. Re-read Ringword by Larry Niven or Eon by Greg Bear for stories along similar lines but much, much better."
1,Punishingly dull,"Extremely tedious - the author's had some good ideas, but the characterisation is just terrible - not one character that I cared about at all. Disappointing."
2,A disappointment from Reed,"I really love Robert Reed's short stories that have been appearing in all the SF magazines. He's a very good storyteller, and usually has really inventive concepts sprinkled throughout his stories. Marrow has no shortage of great ideas, with a huge ship that can carry a planet that no one knows about, humans that are essentially immortal thanks to nano-technology, and a horde of fascinating non-human alien species. They are all great ideas, but as other readers suggested, the characters really aren't that interesting. There are hardly any that I really cared about, except for a captain named Pamir, and he gets to take center stage about 3/4 through the novel. The first third of the novel is interesting, then Reed switches over to fast forwarding through 100s or 1000s years between chapters. At that point I wanted to stop reading, and only finished the book out of stubbornness. If you have other books on your nightstand, you might want to pass on this one."
4,Doesn't deserve such derision.,"I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews here. While every negative review has valid points, for me, the sheer scope of the ideas in this book carried it through. Not just the Big Ideas, but the little fun ones, too, such as the alien cultures, or life on Marrow (For example, in a world without leather, how would a group of humans who can regenerate get it? By skinning it off themselves...). The Big Ship is one of the best ideas I've come across in SF (almost up there with Pete Hamilton's Ruin Ring). I'd gladly follow these characters through another novel, which is why I've started to read the sequel immediately. If you like big space opera on a grand scale, this book will not disappoint. It deserves to be read by true SF fans."
5,I am completely addicted to Booster Packs,"Since WoTC launched these pre-painted booster packs, I have bene absolutely addicted to them. don't play the miniature game, but I do use the minatures for regular pen and paper gaming. Like the other sets, the stat cards include the minature game stats on one side, and the official d20 stats for 3.5 on the other side. If you see minis as a hobby and enjoy putting them together and painting them, these aren't for you. The quality doesn't compare to a well painted metal mini. But if you are artistically handicapped like me and just like having tons of minis ready to torture players with, these are a must."
5,Probably the best set so far...,"In terms of monster/figure variety and quality of minis. The paint jobs keep getting better and showing more detail. This set in particular has a good number of large figures, including the cool mounted paladin. For Dnd gamers, there are many interesting monsters and villains in this set. For fans of the skirmish game, there are also figures you'll want to add to your next warband."
4,No Angels But Some Fire,This is a continuation in the D&D Miniatures line and maintains the quality of prior releases while adding a few gems.
2,Not So Great,"This Cd is'nt very good, all the small things is old, it's boring now. Anyways they only played it about 20 times a day on just one radio station."
2,excellant,This product is awesome. It keeps me energized and I can complete my day. Will order again.it's a healthy food product.
3,Three Strikes and You're Out!,"The Foremen were(are?) a folk group that played political satire songs. This is their second and last album. Their previous album was great, but this one is a big letdown. It just isn't very funny. I don't know what went wrong here, but it just doesn't click. Not recommended."
2,Misses the mark,"The video is short (45 minutes) and at times confusing as it cuts between late 1900 and earlier periods in Victoria's life. Even a Victoria Buff like me was often trying to place and event or a comment into its proper decade on more than one occasion. I found this distracting, confusing and not adding to the entertainment value of the piece. It certainly did nothing to add to the educational value of the film.Without the pomp and circumstance that surrounds the Royal presence, it was very hard to place the woman herself into a good context. It just seemed like a forgotten old lady in the corner of a nursing home talking to herself in lieu of any visitors."
1,SO disappointed...,"This was not my first purchase of this projector replacement lamp. It seems to be an annual purchase, so it's not like I wasn't aware of what I was getting. Unfortunately when this arrived, after placing it into the projector we were given a ""Lamp did not strike...retrying"" message, to which we never did meet with success. Now, at my own expense, I had to return the non working item and await a refund or replacement (which I decided not to do, in the event that I might have to return IT as well)."
5,great for novices.,Got these for my six year old's party. They are pretty strong and the colors are nice. The kids enjoyed making their own shapes and then playing with them. they stand up to a decent amount of rough play and twisting. We are very satisfied with this purchase.
5,Great Balloons,"These balloons are perfect for doing all sorts of twisting. I am not a professional but was asked to balloon twist for a fair at my church. I purchased these because in my research I learned that qualatex is what professionals use. They worked very well. I used them to make princess crowns, butterfly wings, turbans, dinosaurs etc. Great. Someone else brought another brand of balloons to use as well, maybe from Party city, I'm not sure, but they kept popping! I was suprised at the difference between the two types of balloons."
5,Perfect for balloon-twisting,we have purchased these balloons before from a party store and this time ordered them online--they were just what we expected and for a better price.
4,Exploring the art of balloon twisting,"I am teaching myself balloon twisting and purchased these based on other reviews. The colors are amazing as far as balloons go and the balloons are really easy to work with. I did try to blow a few up without a hand pump and found it near impossible. I have had quite a few pop, but I honestly think that it was due to my twisting and retwisting in an effort to get the twist just right. There are also bound to be a few duds in a package this big. On the bright side, my kids are no longer afraid of the loud noise that a balloon makes when it pops!Overall, I think that these are a good quality balloon for the price."
1,These were not 260 they were 180,I still needed these balloons but it would me nice to get what I ordered not something else. Can You change your page so no one else get's tricked.
2,lots of black balloons,"I have not used these balloons, so I do not know about the quality but there are far too many black balloons in this bag for my taste,instead of other fun colors. I ordered them for my school library for kids to learn balloon twisting. I will probably try another source next time, not that there is anything wrong with these they are just ugly. I would like to have known this before I selected them."
3,"Not bad, but lacking of punch. Soothing = boring?","I'd agree to those who mentioned that most of Mehdi's album are overrated. I just can't understand why most of the review rate his album at 5/5. 5/5 means perfect, and his album is nowhere near perfect. It's nice allright, good as a background & relaxation music, but not good enough to receive full stars. Most of the soundtracks are loopy and repeating the same thing over and over again. I would simply say his albums are lacking of originality. Moreover, more works need to be done on the quality of the audio recording & processing, as it simply sounds too synthetic and lacking of sound dynamic. Or maybe Mehdi's musics are intended to be played for background music in department stores so that the audio quality is not that important?"
2,Do you like Musak ?,"This is basically Musak(tm). Very plain, nothing really creative, going nowhere, boring. If you are looking for reasonably good background music then by all means, this is a reasonable buy.But don't look for anything more, like originality and depth, in this album because there is none. This is the only Medhi album I have, maybe the others are better, I don't know. Somebody mentioned Yanni, and I think the analogy is appropriate."
2,Disappointed,"After listening to the free MP3 selection that is provided by Amazon, I decided that this astist maybe worth a listen; so I sent off my hard earned cash for a copy of this particular CD.[...] Since receiving the CD, I've aired on a number of occasions but I find it rather clinical, like the whole musical score has been written around a drum beat machine. Being a slightly older person, I remember when musicians actually played all of the instuments, not computers. I have listened to a large number of other artists playing world type music, some playing instruments that are hundreds of years old in design and its the raw edge that these instruments provide that makes the music so smooth and real.I think that that concept of this CD is good, but I think that Medhi would get more kudos if he got away from the clinical beat of drum machines and computer generated type music. I look forward to the release of Medhi ""Unplugged""RegardsRusty (Lover of the natural beat)"
3,Why do everyone give Mehdi 5?,Someone said Mehdis first album sounded like hard quantified midimusic and even if i liked it a little it does so. The songs are simple and very demosounding but this new album sounds better mixed and with more reel instruments. [...]
2,"Repetitive, unimaginative","Wow. Only one other reviewer found this CD boring? It is maddeningly dull and repetitive, IMHO. I was expecting an inspired performance, not my ten-year-old nephew's synthesizer practice session."
4,Ancient Treasuretrove,"Yeah, the rollcalls of reviewers have nimbly scribed the parallels...the intimacy of Will Oldham,guitar phrasing of the late Fahey, and this is meant in the best possible way, a sweet, sweet voice, a brush of sentimentality creeping in here and there. Impossible to dislike or dismiss, Ward has discovered on this CD and Transistor Radio, a sound that sounds at once both ancient and contemporary; a quality that equally applies to Bon Iver, Oldham, or Zac Condon's equally seductive music with the various Beiruts. Whatever may be wrong with the current woeful state of the Western Dream, these musics are a counteract."
5,Great Music,"M. Ward is truely amazing. His voice is different, but thats what makes his music beautiful. I heard his music played at work one day (Let's Dance) and could not get it out of my head, so I went online and bought the CD. This is one of the best CD's I have ever purchased!"
1,No bueno!,"The CD I ordered was not the one shipped to me - the correct case came, but an entirely different CD was within it. It was a hassle to get ahold of the Wooden Nickel to see how to get a refund or correct CD sent. I had to mail back the CD and received a credit through Amazon - not even a real refund. I would not recommend ordering any merchandise from the Wooden Nickel Trading Company - not reliable or prompt."
1,A snoozer of a thriller (SPOILERS),"What a concept...in 1943, Roosevelt and Stalin agreed, at a secret conference, to a long-range plan that would, in the end, split the entire world between their countries, and the only people who can stop it are a reformed ex-Nazi and his son.Unfortunately, the execution of the concept is horrible. The main character, a boozing, pill-popping, temper tantrum throwing, suicidal, apathetic nihilist gets zero audience sympathy. Transitions between scenes are very confusing, and there's long philosophical dialogues that have little or nothing to do with what the characters began talking about.This is almost an unreadabale book. Stay away!"
5,Best CD for bedtime ever,"My son is now just over two years old. And we have played this about 6 out of 7 nights a week since he was born. We never get sick of it. It's so relaxing, and enjoyable for Mom and Dad as well."
5,A must-have CD for parents of any toddler and/or preschooler,"This is a truly wonderful CD! It definitely does lives up to its title. It has worked fantastic and a relaxing way to ease the little girl that I care for into her naps for many months now. She is a music lover, but had trouble napping. When she hears Nat King Cole and Judy Garland's voice she automatically starts getting drowsy. This CD really lulls her to sleep without much effort. The songs are all great and easy to hum or sing along to as well. I knew this CD was going to be a hit when I previewed the songs here on Amazon's website and my husband nodding off to sleep while listening to them too. I have recommended it to all of the parents that I know!"
5,enjoyable listening,I play this CD before my toddler's nap. The sweet jazz melodies mellows him out and it puts him to sleep instantly! I actually fall asleep myself! It's a great CD to wind down to.
3,Nice CD,"This is a good CD with some classics that are nice to listen to. Not the best lullaby CD that we listen to, but it's not bad. Susie Tallman has a lullaby CD that my daughter likes better, but this is still worth buying for some variety and exposure to jazz."

5,Unrestricted Warfare,"Unrestricted Warfare is an excellent ""captain's eye view"" of submarine combat in the Pacific during the Second World War, and an essential volume for those interested in naval history or military leadership. Thoroughly researched with help from the Japanese side, the book tells its story by tracking the wartime careers of several submarine officers who became the Silent Service's top scorers ever, including Richard O'Kane and ""Mush"" Morton. Unrestricted Warfare is hardly a puff piece, however: the author unflinchingly reveals the truth behind several wartime atrocities, while also explaining in detail the tumultuous political climate and leadership failings that beset the submarine force during the war. DeRose also does a fine job reconciling the often inflated claims of wartime reports with newly uncovered data, and the book features many illustrations never before seen in print."
5,US Submaine,This book will give you an insight into the type of men who manned our underwater fleets.
1,What is goin' on now?!,"This novel is obviously geared towards teens, but why is there an active homosexual pursuit from one character to convert a hetrosexual to her own sexual disorientation?What is the author trying to prove? I feel the same way towards hetrosexual people: don't strut around saying what you do in the privacy of your own home. There are LESS that 1/10 of 1% of homosexuals in the general population, but this book makes it seem that homosexuality is normal and should be pursued.Does the author have a political agenda to an otherwise good story?Leave your romps at home. We don't want to hear it."
1,Not what I expected!,"I am sure there are people who like this, but I didn't. I hope I find something I like by next Christmas."
2,German Christmas music,Nice music but I wanted to hear more German. Some of the songs arein Latin. I was somewhat disappointed.
2,"Get real folks, this is average at best","Come on, people, this album's not as good as all that. It's too long and too derivative. Can they do a song that doesn't sound like ten songs I haven't heard before? Can we get out of the key of G and stop doing all those sincere strummy songs, just for once? All this ""No Depression"" stuff sounds the same to me anyway, and none of these jokers have half the talent that Gram Parsons (who invented the genre years ago) did. This album included. Most of this sounds like outtakes from John Cougar Mellencamp albums, and that's not a compliment. I fail to see how this garnered all the five star reviews; to me it's a lot of rehashed, boring stuff."
5,Wilco's Best Album,"Wilco's second album is a two disc set that showcases the past, the present, and the future. There are songs that sound like their first album and frontman's Jeff Tweedy's first band Uncle Tupelo. Then some songs sound like their more experimental albums of the present. This album along with Summer Teeth borderline the change of Wilco. Both discs have great songs on them. Favorites include Misunderstood, Far, Far Away, Outtasite (Outta Mind), Forget the Flowers, Red-Eyed and Blue, I Got You (At the End of the Century), Say You Miss Me, Sunken Treasure, Outta Mind (Outta Sight), Someone Else's Song, (Was I) In Your Dreams, Lonely 1, and Dreamer in My Dreams. Highly Highly Recommended."
5,Review Of 'Being There',"I bought 'Being There' on a whim, and was surprised to hear what I heard. This 2-disc set features an amazing display of Wilco's versatility and proves their fan base right--they're an excellent band. From the sad country-fried ""Red-Eyed and Blue"" to the raucous rockers like ""Monday"" and ""Dreamer in My Dreams,"" Wilco shows off their chops, while remaining true to the precedent set by their first album, 'A.M.' Get this album. You will not regret it."
4,Get this and it's all you need,"These two discs rock...Pop them in your car stereo and drive down a long winding freeway (I suggest CA highway 280 between San Francisco and San Jose) with the top down. You can't help but sing along. Some of the songs make my heart break, others make it shine with happiness (got you and that's all I need)..."
5,Great Breakup Music,"This epic saga from one of America's best bands of the 90's means a lot of things to a lot of different people, but to me it represents starting over, asserting your own independence. In ""Far Far Away"", the speaker misses his lover, but is resigned to the fact that he must start over-- ""deep in my heart, I know it's right."" All the while pedal steel guitar weeps over the song's delicate melody.To me, ""Being There"" and ""Summerteeth"" work as perfect companion pieces-- ""Being There"" is like being in the moment of personal trauma, reacting with immediacy, while ""Summerteeth"" has a more detached, reflective and often impressionistic tone. I'll hold these records dear to me for the rest of my life."
5,ENDLESSLY PLEASING,"I bought this one at a Wilco concert last year thinking I knew Wilco (I'd already owned SUMMERTEETH & had just purchased YHF a few days before the show) BEING THERE taught me what they were all about as it will you. Pick this one up today & listen carefully. Incredible!! So good for your health!! Whenever I feel down & hopeless, I listen to a few tracks and..well, here I am happily plugging this CD!!"
5,The first CD is one of the best albums ever,"Buy this recording immediately!I'm not the kind of person who compulsively listens to one CD over and over -- except for this one. There's a wide variety of ""sounds,"" for lack of a better word, on this album. That's why I can listen to it over and over again.From the slow to the fast, the rocking to the folksy, this album has it all.Please note this information only applies to the first CD -- the second is just average. But the first CD more than makes up for it."
4,a hidden treasure in todays world of modern music,"I bought this album on recommendation of another Amazon.com review of one of my favorite bands, The Counting Crows latest release ""This Desert Life"", in his review the reviewer gives a thank you to Jeff Tweddy for his song writing, being a critic myself I could respect this persons views so I picked up this CD.While I won't draw any comparisons to other bands (I don't see the point really) I will say this is a brilliant album, especially effective if you listen to disc 1 while driving alone at night, really beautiful lryics and some melodies that take you places.My only negitive comment would be that some of the melodies sound dirived from all too familure songs, Eagles, Beatles, etc. Don't let that stop you for listening though, cause you'll really be missing out."
4,"Double Your Pleasure, Double Your Fun","While I much prefer Tweedy & Co.'s shift away from alt-country after this record, Being There is still a really great double-album that I hold in high regard. Like every Wilco record, this one takes a couple of listens before you can fully appreciate it. The fringe-country stuff (Far, Far Away / Forget The Flowers / Someday Soon) is fantastic and provides the backbone for the band's foray into rock (Hotel Arizona / I Got You / Monday) and Tweedy's quieter ballads (Sunken Treasure / The Lonely 1). Kingpin and Dreamer In My Dreams tend to fall somewhere in the middle of the rock/country spectrum, and are great examples of how talented each musician is. I gave this one four stars, but a good argument can be made that it deserves five."
4,"You'll enjoy ""Being There""","After Wilco's excellent debut album, ""AM,"" band leader Jeff Tweedy decided to move the group away from it country roots into a more overtly pop direction on this expansive double album. Along the way, he experiments a lot, sometimes but not always for the better. Still, Tweedy manages to serve up many fine songs, the best of which are probably ""Kingpin,"" ""Monday,"" ""Hotel Arizona,"" and the accoustic ""Someone Else's Song."" Though it could have been pared down to a single and thereby stronger disk, ""Being There"" still has plenty of fine moments and is well worth purchasing."
4,Experimental Alt-Country,"""Being There"" is often called Wilco's masterpiece, but in many ways it is merely a precursor of things to come. Not yet in full Brian Wilson mode, and still working within its country roots, ""Being There"" is a highly enjoyable blend of American styles. The album features some of their most convincing hard rock, not to mention the achingly beautiful ""Far Far Away.""My only complaint (and the reason ""Being There"" doesn't merit 5 stars) is that some of the material should have been left out. The first disc is strong from start to finish - a virtual masterpiece. However, around the middle of the second disc, the music becomes rather tedious - the rockers grating, the ballads uninteresting. With some careful editing, ""Being There"" could have easily been a single-disc masterpiece."
3,pushing forward back...,"after the simple alt-country flavorings of a.m. wilco begins to add some new layers with the sometimes overly ambitious being there. not that there aren't great songs. ""monday"", ""outtasite (outta mind)"", ""i got you"", ""sunken treasure"", and ""misunderstood""but being a double album the energy seems to fade a little on the second disc. but give them credit for branching out, which will pay even bigger dividends down the road..."
3,Can't separate the prime from the padding,"Like most double albums, this epic of ambient roots-rock has difficulty justifying its own self conscious hyperperbole (beyond, of coarse, the common excuse of ""We wrote alotta stuff""). Detail production aside, Wilco connect here only when they pick up their electric instruments and go for broke; ""Outta Sight (Outta Mind)"", ""Monday"", and ""At the End of the Century"" set ambitions aside by basking in their own revelry. Being There is, otherwise, too padded to function as a wholely satisfying listen. Opener ""Misunderstood"" does happen upon a nicely lilting melody, but the remaining down-tempo material (""Hotel in Arizona"", ""Sunken Treasure"", etc.) sacrifices hooks for light experimentation or genre integrity."
5,Having fun with my 11 year old,Very solid cribbage board. Well laid out. Having a great time with my 11 year old. (He beat me last night.)
4,A Good book for the Bible Student,"John Wesley's whole life is on display, from his time at Oxford to his marriage later in life.You will learn about his friendship with george whitefield, the sermons he preached, the passion he displayed, his missionary work in the usa with his brother, and his evangelistic preaching in his homeland by horseback in britian.A Must get for the bible school student."
5,Missionary Stories for Youth,I was very happy first to be able to find this out-of-date book for my grandhcildren. It is even better than what I expected and came very quickly.
1,Biassed information,"As a physicist I value objective information on any given subject. This book however is clearly written from a ""Hate"" perspective and twists every word found in the original Falun Gong books to use it to persecute.Readers interested to learn what Falun Gong is all about, can find that best in the books ""Falun Gong"" and ""Zhuan Falun"" by the founder of Falun Gong, Mr. Li Honghzhi..."
1,Don't buy this book!,"This is a propaganda book. Don't even bother to read it. I would give no star for it, but the system doesn't allow. :(I have read Falun Gong books and have met many Falun Gong practitioners. I know many friends who practice FG, and some of my family member also do it. They are superb!If you want to know about Falun Gong, I would recommend everyone to read Zhuan Falun instead and find out what Falun Gong is about by yourself. You won't regret it."
1,Book of Lies and Hatrid against a peacfull people,"This book by Ji Shi is a book full of lies and haterid, to see the truth of Falun Gong / Falun Dafa, which is based on Truthfullness, Compassion and Tolerance, see the book Called Zhuan Falun or China Falun Gong, this is not to get you to buy this book as it can be downloaed free from the internetThe reason for this review is to give the people of the world a balanced view of Falun Gong and let them see that there is goodness, compassion, and forbearance in the world and it is spreading, no matter what lies or persacution is brought against it.Make up your own mind, but do get the true story first"
1,Totally non-sense. The book is really Deceiving the Public!!,"It is clear from the contents of the book that The author does not know much about Falun Gong. Maybe a book to please Chinese government, or get funding from there. Otherwise, how come this kind book could be printed!"
1,This book is full of lies.,"This book is full of lies. The Chinese Communist Party has been persecuting Falun Dafa, a peaceful religious group since 1999. Countless memebers have been killed because of their beliefs. Such a book angers me greatly and dissapionts me, it is ful of propaganda. Falun Dafa's only crime is trying to improve the moral standards of people."
1,This Book is Chinese Communist Party's Propoganda,"Falun Gong has been persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party since 1999. The author of this book certainly does not have an objective and righteous view and is willing to serve as a mouthpiece of a dictatorship, trying to mislead people outside of China."
1,This is Chinese Communist government propaganda,"""Deceiving the Public and Ruining Lives"" is an appropriate description for the content and intention of this Chinese Communist Party propaganda piece. I wouldn't even use this book for fuel in the fireplace at home, for concern that the smoke would form a poisonous gas and harm my family.In all seriousness, this is akin to a Nazi book slandering and defaming Jews during the Holocaust.I recommend both the publisher and Amazon.com to do their homework and remove this book from their shelves."
1,"This book deserves no stars, it deserves 5 Xs",Saying things that are far from the truth are actually going to come back to yourself and hurt yourself. The auther will deserve what he or she planted for.Do not waste your money on this book. It does not worth it. The title tells it all.
1,Just lie,"This book is just lies. Lies like the nature of the Chinese Communism Parti who ignite this evil and abominable persecution. Why this book dosen't say that in labor camp, Falun Dafa female practitioners are raped by the police and those who are pregnant are forced to abort aven after 7 months.I hope that this review will be posted to inform people about what's really happen for Falun Dafa practitioners in China.Martial Bachoffner"
1,China's communist regime keeps deceiving the public,"During the past four years the so-called people's republic of China cracked down on this spiritual practice and did everything in it's power to hide the truth and spread lies. This book is a fine example of that.What they don't tell you in this book is that more then 700 people were tortured to death and thousands were sent to labor camps, just for their belief in the principles of truthfulness, compassion and tolerance."
1,Breeding Ground For Hate And Hate Crimes,"This type of book tends to produce a negetive response to an uninformed public concerning this peaceful Qigong practice with the principles of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerence. There is much persecution in China of this practice and the practitioners. Everyday there are deaths of practitioners, everyday the torture goes on, and everday China is reaching it's black hands to try extending it's persecution beyond its own borders to free countries.I recommend for individuals to seek other sources for true information about the practice and the practitioners. Checking out practice sites in their areas, going to the website for Falun Dafa...and reading Falun Gong or Zhuan Falun by Mr. Li Hongzhi will give a truer picture of what this practice is."
1,False propaganda,"I wouldn't rate this book any stars at all, but as the lowest rating is 1 star I had to rate it that in order to write this review. This book is a clear voice of the Chinese regime in their attempt to denounce Falun Gong, which they supported large scale until the crack down in July 1999. Falun Gong is a very peaceful and effective Qigong practice that greatly improves physical and mental health, teaching people how to become good people, and NOT what this book tries to proclaim. I have practiced Falun Gong now for almost 4 years and can answer for this systems' effectiveness on mind and body. Please read Zhuan Falun which is the teachings of Falun Gong instead."
4,A very well done and organized album.,Gravity portrayed the Bush Babees as young men now as opposed to their first album. A definite hip hop classic.
3,Your family's not this bad.,Ma is a monster. Her grandson is dropped into this zoo. Can he survive? Some bad ass characters on both sides of the law propel this one. A bumpy ride.
5,THE YEAR'S BEST FILM - TRULY OUTSTANDING,Multi award winning film incl best actor/actress/film etc etc. If only other films could be as brilliant.Truly unforgetable.
3,Don't understand the ending,"I don't understand the boy killing the big boss at the end, and the blond matriarch gathering him to her arms as though he has solved or resolved something.Would Guy Pierce be happy to see that his protégé turned out to be a murderer after all?Is this hazy character motivation? Was the director unable to think of an ending, and did he choose this unexpected ending because it would function as a surprise?I don't see the answer to this question in any of the 45 reviews herein."
2,Very disappointing,"I kept waiting for this film to do, well, SOMETHING. This was a long, drawn out, nothing. The leading character was wooden. Most of the acting was either over the top or boring, except for a character that is killed early on. Guy Pearce did what he could with a strange role, but there wasn't one character that had any dimension or personality. You barely care when one of them gets killed. Both the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys are interchangeable, which is never a good idea for a supposed crime thriller; there has to be more obvious conflict. I wanted to see the film because of the raves over Jackie Weaver's supposedly shocking crime mama role, and what a letdown that was. I found her neither shocking nor interesting. All I could look at were her eyebrows, which were unmoving.I wanted to like, if not love, this film, but I honestly was angry by the end of it, for wasting my time and for believing the reviews. This was over hyped and overrated, in my opinion."
3,Blood is probably not any thicker than water,"""Animal Kingdom"" is a dark and brutal Australian crime thriller. Its moral center (who may or may not be de-centered by the end of the film) is J, a 17 year-old boy, whom we see in the opening frame of the film, sitting next to his mother, recently dead from a heroin overdose. With nowhere else to turn, J calls his grandmother, played with saccharine evil by the Oscar-nominated Jacki Weaver. J moves in with his grandmother and his four uncles, each one a criminal of varying degrees. As the uncles engage in various crimes, bodies begin piling up, and J finds himself in a quandary--remain loyal to his amoral and ruthless family or trust in the promise of safety offered by a sympathetic police detective, played by Guy Pearce? For a violent crime thriller, this film moves rather slowly and methodically, and the acts of violence punctuate the contemplative pace of the film like explosive exclamation points."
5,DVD,Not a well publicized movie but the acting and the story is something those who view it won't soon forget. A great addition to anyones movies collection.
1,"Poor product, poor service","First of all, no paperwork came with the shipment. Nothing -- no shipping paper, no instruction/product information (this was supposed to be an electric violin but came with no adoptor, cord, earphone, etc.).As soon as I tried to tune the instrument, one of the strings came loose. Upon inspection, I noticed that the peg hole was not drilled through and the string was originally just wrapped around the peg (that was why it came loose) -- we had to drill a hole into the peg to make it work. We had other issues with the instruments.Emailed the vendor asking for assistance -- received no response.Do not recommend this product -- bad craftmanship and bad service."
4,Good customer service.,"The description of these gloves said ""made in USA"" when I ordered them, however, they were actually made in China. Hazen & Associates gave me a refund and updated the description when I notified them of the error."
1,Yuck.,This is a terrible CD. The songs sound......incomplete. Whomever recorded this should be shot or have your ears checked. No wonder the guitar player quit the band. Avoid at all costs.
2,"Technically proficient, emotionally deficient",Like so many urban bands it is easy to hear between the lines of all of these tracks. There is technical proficiency that any technical person would admire. I like the booming base lines and growling vocals. Is that Yngwie in the background? But these are not the words or the music of a band that has lived through much together nor has much to say about life. Life costs nothing. It is a blessing. These guys sound like part-time musicians living musical half-lives. Lots of talent and potential but they're holding back for some reason.
4,Great Local Band.. Check them out..,Very strong guitars and vocals.. and check out the awesome photo on the back of the CD.. great effect.. oh yeah.. and awesome thunder bass playing..
5,Best Game for GBA,"I am perhaps the biggest Wario fan ever. I have been waiting for this game since Januray 2001 when i heard there was going to be a Wario game for GBA. Well, the day finally came when i got to play it. I popped it into my trusty GBA, and was immediately impressed with how good Wario looked on GBA. I continued to play, and was again impressed with how good the game as a whole looked. And then the game was over. It was over in less than 3 hours. If i am going to pay [price] for a game, i would except it to last a little longer than 2 1/2 hours, even if it does star my beloved Wario. Even though it was ridiculously short, i would recommend this game to anyone who has ever wanted to grow an angular moustache that vaguely resembles a ""w"", anyone who has ever found themselves inexplicably shouting out ""It'sa me, Wario"", or anyone who enjoys video games."
2,My Daughter loves this game,"My daughter will be 6 in January and she is a wiz on her gameboy advance. This is one of her favorite games. I am a gamer from way back and often I run into areas I don't know what to do and have to ask her for help. She loves it when she can say, ""Here let me do it for you."""
4,"Really,Really wicked",Wario land 4 is a really good games with some extremely fun mini-games along with the great passages you have to complete. There are some really good graphics 100% better than the GBC ones. The only one slight problemn with it is that the game is quite simple and easy. Apart from that Wario land 4 is an amazing game that you must buy.
5,!!!!!!!!!!!! Warioland 4 Wrocks !!!!!!!!!!!,"Wario is back for more and more! This time Wario finds a golden pyramid and must find a way to get the booty!! But to get the treasure,he must go through 5 levels in the place and deafeat the Bosses! Level 1 is simple,the other 4 are harder to do !! I am probobly the Wario fan of all time!The games are simple and fun!This game is so good,it's worth 5 stars !Warning,This is only for Wario fans only !!!!!!!1"
5,best game yet for gba,"I have played this game for a few weeks (since nov. 1)and i love this game. its amazing, the graphics are smooth and amazing, the gameplay is almost the same as classic wario but with a few new moves. a tutorial is included in the game makes it very easy to learn the few special moves. anyone over 7 years old should be able to play this game. THIS IS THE BEST GAME YET FOR GAMEBOY ADVANCE SO GO BUY IT if you dont youll be sorry it will probably have sold out by the next chance you have to buy"
4,"Good,","It's a good game, but if you don't save your game, You have to go through a slow process. You can choose to play at 2 levels, Normal and hard. It's a puzzle game. Overall it's a fun game for someone who can never get past level 3 on adventure games, like me."
3,Good but not great,"This game has great graphics and gameplay but once you beat it it gets really boring. The mini games are: Home run Derby, Wario Hop, and Wario's rouette they're o.k. The music is pretty good but could be a lot better if there were more levels."
1,i agree with the above,its true every thing about that game is true that game really bites the big one just read above
3,Mario beats Wario But Peking duck beats noodles,"Ok, i first played this game during a Chinese New Year Banquet which was amazing... I love peking Duck...... And those Crab balls... hmmmmm. Anyway my friend lent it to me during a boring speech about ma and horses and mama mia, obviously he was kind of tipsy... nobody was really listeningSo i asked my friend for the game. He lent it to me and when i started i was amazed by the graphics!! that guy was still talking... But the game was very confusing... Still talking.... Oh look Pork pause game... hmmm good... anyways I got pretty disoriented in the first level unlike i did with Super Mario advance 2. Guy still talking... Now brought in a painting of horses. The game was bad... The reason i gave it 3 stars and not 1 was 'cause it made time pass pretty quickly. Oh good noodles hmmmm... Now the guy shut-up. Can i borrow Super Mario Adv. 2? Thanks. This Mario game kicks ... Oh look tea... bye have to go now need to drink tea...GoodBye"
4,Warios back.,Im not a big fan of the wario series but i have played most of them. This one seemed different for some reason. It is different than mario because unstead of going in one direction u go into a series of mazes to defeat enemies. Unstead of jumping on the enemies u run in to them and pick them up. The graphics r ok for the GBA but better then usuall. I like the feature of the motercycle because it is a fun and easy way to defeat enemies. Compared to other Wario games this one is fun and entertaining.
2,Beautiful Cello--bad strings,"What a gorgeous cello! Nice ""practice"" cello---but it immediately needed new strings, and the pegs won't hold. We're still working on it and after new strings plus some peg dope (thank you Sharmusic.com), the pegs still won't hold the tuned strings. Once we get that settled, tho, it ought to play very nicely."
2,Non secure,When the box arrived it was not packed corectly and the item. Was split tried reaching company by email no answer really disappointed no money to by a new one or to fix it
4,This gun ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This gun is awsome! I got it this month and was exactly what I expectied. I can hit a human size trash can from 130 feet way( I have not tried any farther)! My trash can has a small square on it and I can hit that too. The gun shoots in a straight line. The shiping was great. It was there before the email said it would be. Over all this is a great gun the only thing I can say bad about it is that some parts get lose( the bipod, the scope rail, and the bolt) but all you need are the right tools and your fine."
2,UTG,"Dont buy guns if they are made by UTG. I have bought a number of guns from them and my airsofting buddies have as well. They are a terrible manufacturer, all the UTG guns we had broke within 2 or 3 weeks of purchasing with only light to moderate use (maybe used 2 times a week). Gun was not as fast as advertised and was again poorly manufactured. AVOID!!!!!!"
2,ok rifle,"This is not a bad rifle. The reason why i gave it 2 stars is because, the bolt is hard to pull back and the magazine is difficult to work with. If u want get this gun, think twice because that is a bad idea."
3,Okay need heavier BBs,"The gun was easy to assemble. This gun needs heavier BB's to stop it from curving up, try .25 BB and still curves up, planning to try heavier BB's and see if it works otherwise it is not worth cost unless you plan on spending more on different BB's and hope it works."
2,what a bummer--Tall Paul mix is INSTRUMENTAL!,"Being a collector of all of Tina's remixes, I already had the WIP remix of ""Angel"" as a bonus track on the special edition of her CD, so I hunted down this disc for the Tall Paul remix--only to find there isn't a single vocal in it accept for an echo of her singing the word ""angel"" once at the beginning of the track. And considering it's a remix that does not sound like the original, doesn't that make it pretty much not a Tina Cousins song at all??? It's a real shame, because the instrumentation of the remix is quite good--it just needs some vocal to make it more interesting..."
5,Unbelievably good!,"Victor Wooten is the most talented bass player I've ever heard. I'm not the most well read musician, but I understand how hard it is run 32 notes down three scales without mising a beat.Throw in Bela Fleck's simultaneously wicked banjo and Future Man's perfect rhythm's and you won't believe you're listening to a live show.Brandford Marsalis plays with them. Man, you gotta hear the solo section of track 3. I don't even know the name of the song, but when Victor, Bela, Future and Brandford all fall off time and beat with each other at the end of the solo section, then drop back in perfectly to a fast paced melody, it's chillingly impressive.Check it out. Especially if you're a musician."
4,live art,"great band, unusal use of instruments.Very suprising. Anyone intrested in Jaz should hear this.I would highly recommend listening to this."
5,This is one of the best live recordings I have ever heard,"Crystal clear, deep and wide soundstage with high degree of separation on instruments. The ""improv/amazing grace"" and ""sinister minister"" cuts are a MUST for any slap bass junkie. UNBELIEVEABLE your neighbors will hate you! If you are shopping for new speakers, take this CD along to test out the LF dynamics.... TURN IT UP AND STAND BACK"
5,Great music,"This CD is probably the best I have ever listened to. This contains mostly unreleased cuts and they all rock! Disc one is considerably better, but Disc 2 has its good stuff. Disc 1 has more upbeat and faster songs, while disc two has some older songs and mostly some slower stuff. either way, this CD is wonderful. next time youre at Borders you should definitly pick up this CD."
5,You have got to hear this album!,"This has to be the most incredible album I've heard in years. My introduction to Bela Fleck and the Flecktones was on a trip to the States from the UK in 1993 on business. I flicked on the TV in my hotel room and there was a music festival on. I watched the incredible wizardry of Victor Wooton on the bass and was transfixed. Never before had I heard a banjo sound so exciting as it was they way Bela Fleck played it. I had only a few minutes to listen before I had to leave, but that experience left its mark. Why then did it take me 13 years to try out a Flecktones album? God knows, but all I can say is BUY THIS ALBUM! Whatever musical vibe you're into, whether Jazz, Bluegrass, etc, I can guarantee you will LOVE this album. The music is sensational, and the incredible talent of all the musicians is something I find it hard to put in words. As you can tell, I'm now hooked on Bela Fleck and the Flecktones! And I suspect you will be too."
4,near perfect,"not every song is great, but it's still probly my favorite live album ever. victor's bass playing is incredible. and bela's banjo is like nothing i've ever heard. what's great about this album, is that although it has two of the greatest modern musicians on it, it still sounds very much like a band. there is one song with only victor, and one song with only bela, but the rest of the the cd is all done as a band. the band seems to really connect too. to me, this is some of the most incredible music ever recorded live."
2,Disappointed,"I had heard some Bela Fleck at a friends house, playing in the background as we played cards. Not even sure what the album was, but I like the banjo and what I heard was pretty darn good.I bought this thinking it was a 2-disk collection of more banjo, after listening to both CD's several times, I've put the disks on that special shelf with all the other stuff I will never listen to again. Too much ""improv"" - apparently to show the listeners just how good they are with their instruments. Can't dispute that; all of the musicians are at the top of their game, their competence is without question, but there is not a single ""tune"" on either of these CD's that I found the least bit interesting. Since this is the only 2-star review out of more than 60 reviews, maybe I'm just not ""cool"" enough to appreciate this kind of music. Yes, I was disappointed."
1,No factual how to do it info,"This is just an overview book, not a detailed how to do it manual. And not written by Cyril Wecht, just introduced. I felt ripped off."
4,A fine book,This is my first Frommer's guide book. The map is great and better than Fodor's. The accomodation section is definitely the best part of the whole book. Arthur Frommer is really a penny pincher. For twenty something travelers who want to go the night spots will have to ask around or go with Lonely Planet. This book is a 5 star for the budget consicious older folks and anybody traveling with families.
2,"Reasonable, but not 100 accurate","I have to admit I bought this because it was a bit cheeper so I didn't expect too much, but the feet area are narrow so it makes it hard to get a wide foot on there or a man with big feet to fit on the scale well. Since you don't fit perfectly, you then run into the problem of not getting the same reading every time. For example, my husband got on it right after we got the scale and got 3 different readings on his weight. Granted they were between +/- 3 lbs, but to someone who is watching each pound, you might be disappointed.Also the light display is very weak and a bit tough to read. There is no control to allow you to increase the visibility of the display so it can be hard to read in direct light or in non well lit areas.It does the job so I can't complain, but I don't think I would recommend it to someone else."
1,Not what shown in the picture,The space between the strands is much greater than shown in the picture. The cutrain will not hide what is behind it.
3,They Aren't Bad,I live in a chu in Iraq and we just needed suim 2 cut up our sides of the room. They have about a good 3-4in of space between the beeds but they lok nice for just a new look. They will give u splinters if you order the ones that arent coated.
4,Really Nice,"LOVE these bamboo curtains they are gorgeous! I bought 2 in the natural and 3 in the black to cover two sets of glass slider doors. They look awesome, they are very heavy so I had to use a lot of hooks to keep the curtain poles from sagging. My only complaint is the string that was used to string the bamboo seems awfully weak to me. I am going to restring them with fishing line just to be on the safe side. The natural color is way lighter than in the photo, almost white instead of tan. I am buying 2 more of them."
4,These are awesome.,"I ordered two of these to go on my daughter's closet door. They are very cool, and added much to her decor. She loves them. The only downside was the cost of shipping, but I have no regrets for purchasing whatsoever."
4,Just what I was looking for,"This door curtain is great. It is natural looking, durable, and will give your room the effect you're looking for. I was pleased with the looks of this curtain over other curtains because it is so natural looking. The color is great. Much better than similar door curtains as it is without the gaudy paint job and design."
2,Afrocentrism is a Eurocentric myth,"Afrocentrism is not a truth that was covered up by white Europeans. It is a myth that was originally *developed* and *defended* by white Europeans. It is based on what the Greeks themselves said about ancient Egypt. And it was a plausible theory, UNTIL the Rosetta Stone was deciphered, enabling scholars to translate Egyptian hieroglyphics. From then on, we could study what the ancient Egyptians themselves said about their culture -- and what they said was in blatant conflict with the Greek account of Egypt. So ""Afrocentrism"" is really Eurocentric, since it is based on believing what imaginative Greek tourists said about Egypt rather than what the Egyptians themselves said. The title ""Black Athena"" is precisely wrong; Bernal isn't removing a Greek mask from an African face, but rather forcing one onto it."
5,No other Westie book needed if you have this one............,"I purchased the earlier edition of this book many years ago touse as a guide book in our kennel. We here at Kemperland Kennel use it often. It is underlined and marked and used. There are even Betadine stains on it from being close at hand when we were dealing with an emergency. It has helped us through thick and thin of Westie grooming, health, breeding, puppy raising, etc.When the author came out with an updated book in 2001, I bought it as well because I didn't want to miss out on ANY of her knowledge and expertise that she had gleaned from working more years with this wonderful breed of dog than I have had.We recommend this book to all of our Westie clients. It will answer your questions and upgrade your knowledge like no otherbook on them I have found. It, like the Westie, is the ""BEST OF THE BEST""."
5,A great book,"Every dog enthusiast, westie lover or not, should read this book, because even though it talks about westies, one can learn a lot about dogs in general. I have more than 15 years of experience in showing dogs and more than 12 years of professional grooming experience and I still learned a lot from this well written, very detailed and comprehensive book."
5,Westies From Head to Tail,"An absolute must-have for any westie or potential westie owner; not only a marvelous resource book but a true pleasure to read. Many,many pictures of champion dogs and puppy litters from champion dogs so one knows exactly what to be looking for when acquiring a westie. I've owned westies for many years and this is the best book I've come across!"
2,a bum steer from amazon,"This is a great book for people who plan to breed West Highland White terriers, but as the owner of a six-month-old Westie I'm finding it worthless with the exception of the author's charming introductory remarks about the breed. There's no practical advice on training and far more advice than any typical pet owner is looking for with respect to breeding and whelping. The section on grooming is almost ludicrously intimidating. I simply cannot believe the deceptive reviews I read here."
3,"Great images, unnecessarily hard to read","Everyone seems to love this book, but I consider it explains simple things in an overly complicated way. Initially I thought that maybe it was my fault because it's written for the graduate level and I'm an undergrad, but after reading Ethan Beir's beautifully written 'The Coiled Spring: How Life Begins,' and understanding everything I realized that it wasn't me.If you already have some considerable background in developmental biology, you might find this book useful. If you're not so advanced, get 'The Coiled Spring,' you'll glad you did.[...]"
4,"Excellent book, but for initiated people only.","(English is not my mothertongue).From DNA to Diversity resumes links between developments genetics and visible diversity.It is very insightful on how wildlife shapes evolved through mutations of a narrow set of genes.However, it assumes that the reader has the basics in developmental genetic fields.While I have them, I don't think it is suited for the newbie in these scientific fields.Buy it if you're a graduate, PhD, or scientist in biology."
4,The Korean War: Pusan to Chosin,I like is book mainly because it gave me a better understanding of the thoughts and feelings the troops had in the different conficts of the Korean WAR.I have review other books on the subject but I believe this book gives the reader a more personal look at this difficult time. It is worth the time to read and ponder the words. Thank you for a book well written.The area of the book that I feel can be improved is a better matching of the military troop thoughts and the time frame of the conficts as to the duration of the WAR.
5,I cannot put the book down!,"I became interested in the Korean War only after having joined the Army myself. My father fought in the war with the Army, but never talked about his role much, or what he went through. I bought Mr. Knox's book after glancing at it on the book store shelf. The first person accounts bring you right into the war. By allowing the participants to tell the story from the first-person the reader gets a 360 degree view of each battle. The book reads almost like fiction instead of history. I feel the adrenaline rush of battle, the exhaustion of victory and the frustration of grabbing that weapon for yet another 10 mile movement-to-contact without sleep. I feel the loss when one of the ""characters"" is taken away on a stretcher, knowing that I'll not be hearing from him again. I now have a slightly better understanding of what that dirty little ""police action"" was like. I don't think I'll be able to find many more books that can match the emotion of this."
4,good book,"good pictures and draws. Spot procedures. but not enoughI want to this book must been 2 volume set :DI want..I want.......What men want?Absolutely TEXT BOOK, may be with new hardcover in the feature :P"
1,Review - What a joke,"Review - What a joke....Amazon ask for a review when 6 weeks after placing the order I am still awaiting delivery of the book...Amazon get smarter, look at your deilvery dates before expecting a review...."
5,Great book,"This book is used in a lot of veterinary hospitals by clinicians, surgeons and even technicians. It's very helpful and well-worth the price."
5,Basic Surgery Techniques,This book is a very valuable tool. Clearly shows how to complete suturing and identifies instruments clearly amongst other things. Highly recommended.
4,THE surgery textbook,"This is THE surgery textbook for small animal veterinarians.Great descriptions and illustrations. A true ""must-have"" for those interested in surgery.My only critic is that they should decide and split it in two so those of us not into orthopedics or neurosurgery wouldn't have to buy that part. I think this would make for a great soft tissue surgery book and, probably, much more affordable (had to buy it through amazon.com because this book is tremendously expensive in Europe)."
3,Just OK,I purchased this book since it was required for surgery coursed. At first glance you will think the book is great. The book is very large with lots of colorful illustrations. However once you begin reading procedures and referring to diagrams you learn that this book seems simplified. The illustrations that are supposed to describe procedures often are not adequately labeled. I found myself referring to my anatomy texts extensively. Also the descriptions of the procedures themselves are not always thorough. I am often left with questions that I need to research elsewhere.
5,excellent,"It is an excellent book,I can find everything easily whatever I look for.Definitions of the surgical approach,maniplations and treatment are easy and the pictures are perfect.Drug dosages,anaesthetic managements according to the animal status is easy to handle. The tables and figures are very useful and practical.I recommend to all my colleaques who are interested in surgery."
4,HiNRG 80s at its best...but too many time issues on this volume,"Once again, Hot Productions puts together a collection of classics, including some cover versions of 60s tunes. I'm just bummed that ""Reflections"" is an edit of my (9:44) 12 inch version! Track times:1. all American boy (7:37)2. who's your boyfriend (5:16)3. sun ain't gonna shine anymore (7:30) (CD case says 8:30!!!)4. I'm so hot for you (5:09)5. reflections (8:12) (this is an edit of the 12"", which runs over 9 minutes!!!)6. this is my life (5:34)7. nothing but heartaches/nowhere to run (5:54)8. pillow talk (4:58)(CD case says 5:58!!!)9. in the name of love (6:30)10. best part of breaking up (5:38)11. these boots are made for walkin (7:00)12. beeline (9:34)"
5,Adventure of consciousness,"Yes, it was originally written in English, it's not a translation from some Indian language. The whole book is one poem, a long poem, one of the longest, they call it an epic. A poem is not meant for the poets only, it can be read by anyone. But it is so difficult to understand? OK, a poem or a song is primarily meant for the ears, so reading aloud is the key. Can it be one page a day? Yes, and then the power and music of the words play magic. The message seeps in by and by.SAVITRI is the finest substitute for those who can't access the VEDA because of the difficult sanskrit language. As a modern scripture it synthesizes the wisdom of all cultures. So, go for the pure gold; what better way to read SAVITRI than to start reading, right away? Bon Voyage."
3,"Savitri - A friend , philospher and Guide","Savitri has gone much beyond then a poetry could go. Its truely inspirational . I think this a best kind of self help poetry which helps to guide in all problems in life. Its a great workof uncomparable perfection and I would recommend to every one who needs and thinks that poetry could be thier friend , philoshoper and guide."
1,Glass Wind chimes---Dull!!!,"Pretty to look at, dull to the ear!These glass wind chimes are very disappointing! Don't waste your money. They are not like the ""old"" glass wind chimes from yesteryear. They have nomelodic sound and are weak at best. Very disappointing."
2,not the real thing,From the photo these did look like the vintage glass wind chimes. The sound is terrible. They have a very dull tinkling sound.
3,Chiming In,Nice Chime but rather cheaply made as was to be expected from China. One of the strings holding a glass piece was not even tied. Makes a really nice sound though!!!
5,melodic chimes of tinkling Glass,Great looking anywhere you hang it. Love the soft tinkling of the glass. Well crafted by China. Thanks China
5,Lovely glass windchime,Years ago I had a glass chinese windchime and have had trouble finding one. Listening to the beautiful sound of this one brings back so many good memories.Thank you.
3,Not what I expected,"Package arrived quickly, that's good. One piece of glass was not attached. I was able to reattach. Painted designs done poorly. And glass is of poor quality. Edges not clean cut. I decided to keep the chimes because I wanted the old-fashioned type. And I'm too lazy to send them back. I painted over the designs to make them look better. Thinking the price was a little high for what I got."
3,glass wind chimes,"The glass chimes that I recieved look much like the ones I remember from my childhood (I am 82) now, However, they do not have the sound of those old chimes, sorry. They look nice in my patio and I do enjoy looking at them. Betty Masner"
2,Really?,"I love the color, Yet when it arrived today it was broken and cracked. I was sorely disappointed. I was expecting a lovely windchime but all was got was cracked and broken off glass."
4,Don't buy the OCR version!,"The majority of this treatise focuses on the adulteration of various foods but it contains a long chapter on the adulteration of various wines, including Port wine. A very interesting read.Published 1820, this is a good quality facsimile reproduction from 1966 which is much better than the more recent facsimile edition."
4,Tied Up In Knots,"Tied Up In Knots is a story about two stubborn mules who have trouble finding a solution to their problem. As their two young owners, Benny and Sally observe, the stubborn mules become more and more tied up as their problem continues. Sometimes it's difficult to see our way through a problem, especially for children, and it may take a little outside help to intervene. The stubborn mules come to a compromise and Benny and Sally learn a lesson in sharing and also come to resolve some of their own differences."
3,instep double jogging stroller,"the stroller is nice however, the bolts and screws that came with the stroller (it had to be put together) where all rusted. I didnt understand why they would be rusted if the stroller was supposed to be new."
2,"Damn, this stroller sucks","I ditto the previous reviewer...i thought these seats were adjustable, was I wrong, there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down..sucks"
3,Tests AA Lithium batteries? How do I know?,"I was very happy with another ZTS battery tester, and wanted to buy this model from Adorama/Amazon. The photo is of the latest version of the MBT-1 that tests AA Lithium (L91) batteries. However, both the Amazon and Adomara descriptions fail to mention this particular battery. (In fact, the Amazon description doesn't really listing specific batteries.) Until the descriptions are cleaned up, I cannot buy."
4,4 out of 5 stars is very good!,"The tester was a bit more than I would have paid but our engineer recommended this particular unit, it is working just fine for our application. We are happy with the unit."
2,"New one (still ""MBT-1"") can test more kinds of batteries","the new one (note the model number is ""still"" MBT-1has additional battery/cell support - that is the one you want/need - the ""new"" oneLook for one with ten contact points instead of eight, and slightly rounder corners.Here's an example:[...]but as you can see the new ""MBT-1"" has additional battery/cell support"
3,"Good Tester, at first","I bought this tester about a year ago, and it worked well. Just this month, I pulled it out of the drawer, and it did not work. It uses 4 AA batteries, and I removed them. Then, I noticed that several of the battery terminals were corroded. The batteries, DuraCells, did not leak and cause this. The tester has never been outside of an air-conditioned house. The only thing that I can guess is some kind of incorrect plating/coating on the terminals.I am going to clean the terminals, and I hope that it lasts longer. I hate the idea of having to discard a $70 tester aftere one year of use."
2,Other Books by the Author Are Better,"There is nothing wrong with this book or it's content. It is a book about subconcious mind control, through affirmation and visualisation.So why did I give it 2 Stars? Very simple, the reader would be better off buyingYOUR INFINITE POWER TO BE RICH, by J. MurphyAll the content in this book is covered in greater detail in the aforementioned book. I hate books that are produced as an off shoot from another book. I always feel as if the reader is being conned by the publishers, to increase their revenues.If you would like a full review of the content of this book, go to the review I gave for, Your Infinite Power To Be Rich.The concept is the same, but this time the book is too short to fully appreciate the analytical concept.My Advice is forget this mini book and buy Your Infinite Power To Be Rich."
2,How to Attract Money?,"After purchasing and receiving this book, I was disappointed to find that it was more of a spiritual book then a factual based title. Rather then giving ideas on how to ""attract money"" as the title suggests it states that by believing that money is not ""the root of all evil,"" as the bible suggests, then you'll be able to attract the money you seek."
2,Not A Good Blossom Experience,"Now I love Blossom Dearie. I have just about every recording she has been on. That is about 12 if you discard the compilations.My friend, knowing I loved Blossom, had this album in his collection and never listened to it and decided to give it to me as a birthday present - I wish he hadn't. This is a horrific album. It contains the years where Blossom was mistaken for a pop singer rather than a quirky jazz singer.The mix of material is horrible and the overall effect is... well I sold this album right after I got it for $2. I almost felt bad for the guy buying it.STay away at all cost and if you are curious listen to the preview tracks - you'll get it."
5,A interesting story,"I think people should buy this book because it is very interesting.I feel that the book has voice it tells some funny parts some they fight .the chapters are Mongoose ,Brenda,Sonseray,and April Mendez. On the beginning of the story chapter all of them have a problem then they love to read and that solves the problem. -K.M."
2,Review by a 10 year old,This book is about four kids who each find a library card and their lives are changed. It is a very confusing book and some parts don't make much sense. I don't recommend this book. I didn't like it very much.
3,Could Have Been Better,"This book is divided into 4 different stories. One is about a boy who is undergoing peer pressure when he finds a library card and becomes facinated by books. Another is about a girl suffering from laziness who only watches tv. She then must turn off the tv for a week. Another is about a girl who goes aboard a 'library bus' and the last one is about a poor boy who lives in a car with his uncle and travels about.This is aimed more towards younger kids, which is probaly why i didn't like it too much. It was a little too short and some parts lacked creativity. It kept me busy for a couple days, but there are better books I would suggest, such as Tangerine, Silent to the Bone, When Zachary Beaver Came to Town, Holes, The Face on the Milk Carton and A Wrinkle in Time.I give it a 3 out of 5."
1,Parents beware,"The warning has to do with the age level for this book. Eight is much too young for this story. It may be suitable for 11 and above, but not for 8 year olds as there is a story about a suicide attempt. Although Spinelli has written some very good books for children, in my opinion this one should not be read by a younger audience. This problem applies to a number of children's books and perhaps in general the recommendations for age groups should be looked at more carefully."
2,READ THIS BOOK!...,"I didn't like this book because it was to jumpy. I would give it two stars, I wouldn't recommend it . The only part I liked was with Mongoose and weasle. Because They remind me of my friends. That was it. The rest of the book was boaring really. I didn't like the setup."
1,twenty thumbs down,the book is absolutely horrible. they are four stories that (1 have no plot (2 are hard to understand (3 ARE JUST PLAIN BORING! the only story i liked in this book is brenda. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! THIS IS THE WORST BOOK! IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS!
3,The library card,This book is an o.k. book. Most of the time it lost me. It talked about Weasle and Mongoose. Then it talked about a girl named Brenda. But other than me getting lost I liked it. One part that hooked me was when Mongoose and Weasle stole from the store.
4,It's about a mysterious library that appears everywhere.,"The book is about four kids that each find the same library at a different point in their lives. The library is a little mysterious, because each kid lives in a different place, and the library exists at each place. Their library cards were their tickets to freedom. The four kids were named Mongoose, Brenda, Sonseray, and April. Each character was going through a hard time in their life. This book is realistic fiction. I gave this book four stars because it was a little weird, but all in all a good story."
2,A dissapointing book by a usually good writer.,"When I opened this book, I was confronted by a jumble of, how should I say it, not very good stories. The story lines were not very believable because the changes the characters went through were not convincing enough. I love many books by him, and this one just doesn't cut it. Look for more interesting books such as Jason and Marceline, Crash, Maniac Magee, and Space Station Seventh Grade."
4,Stories of how access to books changes lives,"My son recently wrote the following mini-review:A mysterious blue library card seems to help depressed kids by showing them the excitement of the library. For example, while arranging his loot of stolen candy to show his friend, Mongoose is surprised to find a blue library card in the candy... a card that shows him the wonderment of books. Here's another example: Mentally ill Sonseray drops into an air-conditioned building to beat the heat; the building turns out to be a library. Finding a blue library card at the bottom of a baseball card pack he'd taken from a boy, Sonserary discovers the freedom of a library.Can this blue card show YOU the secrets of a library?"
2,disappointed,"I am an adult reader who likes books from tots to large print. I was disappointed in the book, although I had a library card at 6 and am now 71, I never felt into the stories of how the library card was important, were not. Oh, well."
2,Boring,"The Library Card is a boring book by Jerry Spinelli. I don't like to be mean but there is no point to the book. The book is divided into four sections, the first section is kind of funny but the rest is not very good. Each section is about a kid that finds a blue blank card, that turns out to be a library card."
1,This Scale Is Not Accurate,I bought this scale and it registered about 30 lbs less then the doctors scale. I took it back to the store and they replaced it with the same model. I again tried the scale and it was still 8 to 10 lbs less then my normal body weight. My wife and kids tried the scale and their weight was also 8 to 10 lbs less then their normal weight. My advice is to to by another brand!
1,AS SEEN ON TV,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS WAS ON PBS-TV.MORE BRITISH B,S,THINGS LIKE THISHAPPENED ALL THE WAY BACK TO ALEXANDER-THE-GREAT, IN THIS AREA,SO WHYBE SHOCKED?"
3,book review,I thought the book was an easy read and it allowed me to appreciate the power of the techniques utilized. It does not go into how you can evaluate and treat a person but it allows you to look at how these techniques can change the lives of many different patient populations. I read this book since it is required before taking a cranial sacral 1 class but I think I will have a better appreciation of the bigger picture in regards to my learning and how much work I still need to put forth to get to the level of mastery of these techniques.
5,Awesome book and technique,"Highly recommend this book. Especially for anyone wanting to understand more about this technique. Once I got started with this book, it was difficult to put it down."
1,very egocentric,"That book almost turned me off craniosacral therapy. I have experienced it and I know it does work, as many other forms of bodywork do. Unfortunately Upledger is so full of himself and so illogical in his explanations that his book looks like a joke written by a very egocentric man.If people are interested in craniosacral therapy, I suggest they go back to the source and to William Garner Sutherland' work."
1,Craniosacral Therapy,This book was very helpful in presenting alternatives to traditional medicine for a variety of health issues.
2,"Not very useful, didn't work with Black & White (the game)","I bought the mouse so that my Black & White gaming experience would be enhanced, but I was sadly disappointed. Although the mouse works - it vibrates a little or a lot depending on the object in the game you're hand is over - I was unable to get the middle button (the wheel acting as a button) to function in the game, though it'd work fine outside the game. There may be a patch or configuration fix for this, but I didn't want to take the time to deal with it. Even if it worked fine, the performance degradation associated with it isn't worth it. I'd say skip this one."
1,A great idea -- if you can even get it installed.,"Ok. I've installed many different products on many different PCs. But this one isn't working. Three hours later, and it's still stuck in USB hell. And Logitech's tech service is open only 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. -- I'm supposed to stay home from work to get help? It's a mouse, for goodness sakes. Let's see, how do you spell R-E-T-U-R-N."
4,Awesome show,I find it such a shame that this show didn't make it past the 1st season. I just barely discovered it on Netflix a few months ago. Would of really have liked to have seen where these characters went.
4,No Trauma without Cliff,"This may be a little hokey - but who cares - it has the wonderful Cliff Curtis. Let's say, there is no Trauma without Cliff Curtis. He shines here like he alway shines. I'm surprised he doesn't get top billing. And why can't he speak in his native Kiwi? (Cliff is Maori). Why does he have to be someone named Palchik? Anyway - buy this DVD just for the sexiest star in the world. Buy everything with Cliff - he is underated but glorious."
4,Pleased,"If you have the chance to buy Trama, buy it. I wish the show went farther than 1 season. Buy it.Tricia Lowe"
4,"A must watch for any EMS provider. Excellent at showing symptoms/diagnoses. Fun to watch, too.","I watched this just after I completed my EMT-B course. Found it immensely interesting and fun to watch. A little over the top on some of the situations, while others were EXACTLY what we might expect to see. I am really glad they showed the effect that losing a patient or coworker can have on a provider - not talked about enough if you ask me. Only complaint I might have (factually speaking) concerns scope of practice for EMS providers (EMTs and Paramedics) and the consequences that WILL happen if you stray outside your scope of practice. Every EMS provider and potential provider should thoroughly enjoy every episode of this series, I wish they had more than one season. You will enjoy watching this, I certainly did."
5,A MOVING AND HEARTFELT BOOK,"This book is the story of a little girl that had it all in Cuba in the first years of her life, and once communism arrives she looses it all. This book tells you all that she went through in her life as a child, and the impact this has had in her life. This is a true story that will make you laugh and cry. The way this book was written gives you a reality look into what many, many children went through in the early 60's as they had to leave the world and people they knew and loved behind. This book is so powerful, heartfelt and moving that once you start reading it you will not put it down. Great Book!"
3,Twenty Letters to a Friend,"Well-written book, which nevertheless fails to address the main topic of interest: to wit, what made Stalin who he was? They are the recollections of a child, not an adult, and the reader is left still wondering what made Stalin tick. Enjoyed it anyway."
1,Never came,"This was never received. Promises were made to send me the book, not able to get it for me."
3,"Nothing special, but not bad either","Angel of Death is an episodic revenge thriller originally broadcast on the web, written and created by famed comic book writer Ed Brubaker (Captain America, Daredevil, Sleeper, Criminal) and stars stuntwoman extraordinaire Zoe Bell (Death Proof) as Eve; a hitwoman who after sustaining a deteriorating injury on the job, has a change of heart about her job and strikes back at her employers. Wholly predictable but featuring a good amount of bloody action during its brisk 78-minute running time, Angel of Death is entertaining enough to hold your interest, and the fact that Bell herself is a gorgeous sight to behold doesn't hurt matters either."
1,Did we watch the same movie?? This one was lame.,"I never would've guessed this was a major release movie. Had all the production values, script skills, and terrible acting of a high school senior project film. Zoey is pretty hot but this movie was just plain weak."
4,From a student perspective...,"From studying under Amy for a few weeks, it is nice to hear her sing from an audience ear rather than a student. I have not heard these pieces done before, and her lyrical sound makes you very ""excited"" to sit and just listen to the CD. I would recommend this to singers who especially need a good model for a light & warm/rich lyrical sound."
3,Click on Track 10 & listen to a Masterpiece,"This is a good album, not that big of a deal overall, not all tracks are great but Track 10, Ravi, Marc & Gerry's version of ""In A Sentimental Mood"" by Duke Ellington is an absolute masterpiece for the ages, a burst of transcendent poetry, beautiful beyond description, like John Coltrane & Stephane Grappelli jamming in heaven. Click on that track and listen and if you're a true jazz fan, a romantic or both, 20 seconds later you'll be buying this album, guaranteed."
1,Not Accurate At All,I reciently bought this scale and from day one it has been one big hassle after another. For one thing it eats up batteries like crazy and another thing every time i get on the darn thing it gives me a diffrent weight varing arround 30lbs diffrence. I went to the dr's and weighed myself and there i was....... well lets just say i was uh... 100 lbs and when i got home and weighed myself i was 132lbs.
2,"Even to a huge fan of GLB, Copperopolis doesn't cut it...","This album hardly makes it into my cd player. The band was experiencing internal turmoil at this point, and I think it shows. There are incredible songs on the CD - especially when they're played live - but Mighty Joe Moon and Fuzzy are much better overall. Also, Grant Lee Phillip's new solo albums have amazing stuff - I recommend you check those out first!"
5,the idey says this cd is awesome,"the guy before me set it straight with this record. It is damn good. Its almost like putting soundtrack music to lyrics. Grant lee phillips is so talented it p***** me off sometimes but that is ok. Its good to know that GLB is out there so we dont go insane hearing alanis morissette all the time. Now if radio would get off their butts and play these guys, i could turn the radio back on"
5,Start cooking with the Complete Guide to Food and Cooking,"For a young women out on my own, the Complete Guide to Food and Cooking was by my side at all times in the kitchen. It is the dictionary and encyclopedia of the kitchen. Very easy to find items, and it was actually very interesting just to read. It cut down on my phone bill to my Mom considerably. It offers fully illustrated pictures, ""A Tip From Our Kitchen"" provides some quick reading to get you on your way. There are many great recipes included. Along with the illustrations are charts that allow you to be efficient, which is great if you are already in the middle of cooking. I love this book and suggest it for all of my friends."
4,Good introduction to the basic concepts of an MBA education,"I purchased this text as an introduction to basic fundamentals of an MBA education. It met that purpose by providing succinct overviews of the functional areas. If a reader wants a more in-depth look at specific functional areas, this is not the book to buy. I will also comment that I was confused on a case discussion in the finance section and one of the Authors, was very helpful and answered my questions on NPV, through an e-mail. That is why Darden is known as having the best MBA professors."
3,A textbook,"Rather dull but informative guide which shares the basics that one learns in an MBA classroom. Not lively in any way, and with a dearth of graphics, so you'll find it hard to concentrate at times. This edition is a bit dated (around turn of the century) so the references aren't fresh, though still somewhat relevant. A better guide is the ""10-Day MBA"", which I recommend picking up before this volume."
5,Outstanding management insights from teachers at leading MBA,"What a pleasant and useful read! The Portable MBA goes to the heart of management issues facing the fast-rising manager in search of well thought out responses. From marketing and finance to macro economics, this book provides articulate concepts, cogent lessons, and pragmatic ""how to's"" for managers today. Written by faculty from an elite MBA program (The Darden School), this book provides the best of classroom insights. Looking for a short but powerful guide to management in the fast changing world we face? Then read this book!"
2,Not Recommend,"I found this book lacking many of the key MBA ideas, it was too fundamental. As I try to reference it for information, I often can not find relevant information."
1,Not even a beginner's level,"I buy a lot of books. In general I average about $600/year in books. I hold an MSEE and an MBA. So I buy a lot of business and technical books.This is the first time that I feel that a book I baught was so worthless that I felt it my duty to write about it.Sometimes it is hard to keep voluminous books about a particular area. So I thought I could buy a condensé that just reminds me what I need to remember if need be.Well, I got the wrong book. This is the lowest level book I have come across and I am surprised it's writen by so called ""eminent"" professors and endorsed by so called ""Harvard business school"" professors.A blunt breach of credibility for those who wrote this leaflet and those who endorsed it."
1,"Very poor quality, poorly written book",I will strongly advise not to purchase this book. The book is a superficial look at the topics covered in an MBA program.
1,The merchant sent the wrong watch.. and has yet to refund my money after many calls... so I have filed a dispute,I filed a dispute with my credit card representative. The merchant sent the wrong watch.... wrong color dial.... broken gift box.... signs of having been returned by some one else previously.... movement not from Japan.... blue plastic sticker on back of watch missing.... other plastic stickers showed signs of having been handled before and instructions were missing. Called merchant many times with out response. They call themselves the watch pavilion 408 625 6166. I gave them a month to respond and nothing happened. I also talked with an Amazon rep. and have yet to receive a follow up. Left the country for 15 days and returned hoping the issue had been resolved. It has not. I returned the watch aprox. 2 days after I received it being very dissatisfied with the watch. Sincerely. Mr Duran.
3,"Nothing spectacular, but decent","There's nothing extraordinary about this album, but it's not a bad one either. His radio hit, ""Another You Another Me"" is still a good one to chill out to, but the other tracks on this album really don't stand out too much. The album as a whole isn't bad, but probably not one that you want to spend too much on. This is definitely an album that you'll end up selecting a few tracks and burning them on to a CD, rather than letting the CD sit in a player and hear it out completely."
5,"Read this, then write!","I have read many books on screenplay writing and writing in general, ""Writing Movies,"" is by far the easiest to read and the most entertaining of them all. Like a good screenplay this book has ""flow."" It is a book that you will hold onto for your library. The website associated with the book has 5 of the best full screenplays you can down load and print out. One of the best features is that the book uses real movies as references not just stuff made up by the author.The book is set up like a seminar in which the hands on exercises keep it exciting. These associated exercises, are presented at the end of each chapter, help reinforce the reading while sharpening your skills. I would highly recommend this book to any writer, novice or experienced. Read this first, then write your screenplay. For what you get knowledge wise, the price is very resonable."
5,BOOGIE OOGIE WOOGIE!!!,"What a great CD, all new mixes of dance classics, ""Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel"", ""What Is Love"" sound as fresh as ever.The energy on this mega-mixed cd is wonderful, if you are looking for meaningfull dance music this is the CD to own!!. The original artists sound great."
2,Cynical,"There's nothing even remotely ""gay"" about this collection of disco/dance hits, it's just a collection of party favourites, including lots of horrible remixes. There are countless better albums out there -both of ""gay"" music and disco classics. This is just greedy and/or desperate marketing to make a quick buck."
4,MSR Whisperlite service kit,"I have been using MSR Whisperlite stoves for years. I finally had one break -- no pressure from getting to the burner. This kit fixed that problem in only minutes. The photo is deceiving. This kit is very small, very light, and a ""must have"" on extended camping trips."
1,JUST A NOTE TO THOSE READING THE REVIEW UP THERE,"AMAZON'S ALBUM DESCRIPTION UP THERE IS WRONG, THIS ISN'T THE ALBUM WITH 'THE RUNNER' OR ANY OF THE 19 TRACKS THE REVIEW SAYS... THAT SONG YOU CAN'T GET HERE."
4,Live track spoils CD,"This is a greatest hits CD, only problem with it is that this has a live track on the CD that is not stated on the back of the CD."
1,Avoid this collection,"If you like Springsteen songs, buy Springsteen. If you were hoping for the radio version of Quinn the Eskimo, be warned that this is not it. The song should be tagged ""Underwater Version"" so the wary know what they are getting, as I did not."
2,"Saved by ""The Boss""","Were it not for the presence of two bowlderdized Bruce Springsteen songs (the almost identical sounding ""Blinded by the Light"" and ""For You,"" both from Springsteen's folkie debut album), ""The Best of Manfred Mann's Earth Band"" would be a pretty dismal affair. As it stands, those are about the only two listenable tracks. Another Springsteen cover, ""Spirit in the Night"" doesn't work as well, while the Bob Dylan cover ""The Mighty Quinn"" is a wretched live version rather than the charming original. The rest of the album isn't even that good. On the plus side, at least the version of ""Blinded by the Light"" is the longer album cut rather than the chopped up single version.Overall, you should only buy this album if you can't live without having ""Blinded by the Light"" in your collection."
2,Blinded By The Light is The Only Good Song!,"I bought this CD for the song Blinded By The Light and when I got the CD I saw it also had The Mighty Quinn, Blinded By The Light is the only good song on this poorly made CD, The Mighty Quinn is just a bad quality live recording. I'm still looking for a better CD that has better sound quality and Manfred Mann's Earth Band's version of Bruce Springsteen's Blinded By The Light. I will give this CD 2 stars because I love Blinded By The Light, it's one of my favorite 70's songs."
3,not the best,"Blinded by the light is a hot-rodders anthem to a T, anyone with a blown 32' Milner Ford coupe or a hot-rod 57' Chevy knows the song by heart. The other songs are good but by all means are lacking."
3,Not really their best...,"Most people (at least in the US) only associate Manfred Mann with ""Blinded By The Light"" (or if you're a bit older, ""Do Wah Diddy""). Unfortunately, this was really a turning point for the Earth Band. The original line-up had changed and the music took on a more commercial, i.e., less interesting sound. By the early 80s, they were pretty much washed up.Therefore, this CD may be the best of the ""post Blinded By The Light era"", however, it is clearly not the best of Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good tunes on the compilation. But the best music came from the original line-up, which remained in tact through ""Nightengales & Bombers"", the album before ""The Roaring Silence"" (which contained ""Blinded By The Light"").So, if you want the good stuff, try to get your hands on a copy of ""Solar Fire"", ""The Good Earth"", ""Glorified Magnified"", or ""Nightengales & Bombers""...this stuff rocks!"
3,good compilation,"Overall this is a pretty good compilation for someone looking for the Manfred Mann Earth Band hits. Sound quality is only satisfactory. No sonic revelations here. Surprisingly, there is a lot of what could qualify as ""filler"" in between the best stuff. And by ""best stuff"" I mean the Springsteen remakes. All 3 are here and especially, ""Blinded by the Light"" and ""For You"" are incredible."
5,Adorable and Educational!,What a great idea to teach kids etiquette and socialization skills! The girls and their little voices are precious! Great work!
5,this is a great country western album,I had the LP of this years ago. Country western fans I think will enjoy it tremendously
2,Tracy made a big mistake here.,"I am a great fan of Tracy Nelson, and have often thought that if shewould ever record a country album, it would be one of the best. Thisalbum is a complete disappointment, with the sole exception of ""So Lone-some I Could Die."" Even Tracy is allowed a mistake every now and then,and this is a major one."
1,Don't buy this recording,Tracy Nelson is a marvelous performer but this recording is a dud. Sounds like the idea was to sell Tracy Nelson to the polyester Country Music market of the late sixties. I've got a dozen of her cds and this is the only one I've been disappointed with.
3,Disappointing,The seller did a great job getting this book to me quickly. I'm disappointed in the songs but that's just my personal opinion. It's not my go-to book for classical like I hoped it would be.
5,Excellent Book,I've enjoyed playing this book for the past 10 years. I believe this is an essential book to have for any accomplished or even novice pianist. I got it as a gift when i was in my 3rd year of piano and i've loved it ever since then (I'm now preparing for my level 10 practical exam) . It's really helped me develop my sight reading skills. And i've spent hours a day playing these songs for fun. And the format (comb binding) of the book is great because you don't have to worry about the book closing while you're trying to play the pieces.
4,Review of Library of Piano Classics,"I have used this book in my own piano teaching, and it is an enormous volume of some of the very best piano literature. Beware... these pieces are NOT easy!"
5,Excellent Reference!,"I am a critical care instructor belonging to the Critical Care Consortium of Rhode Island, we have adapted this text as part of our Introductory Level Critical Care Program. The students love it! Content is clear and concise. Contributors include some of the best educators in critical care nursing today. I give it high marks."
3,Very Basic,"Good text for those thinking about critical care nursing. Loses value over the long term as a reference book because it is almost too basic. Missing some important aspects of frequently occuring diagnoses seen in critical care ( illeus, small vs large bowel obstruction) etc."
5,Good for a slim fit,"I'm usually a boxer brief guy but if I go boxer this is the choice. Slim fit but it doesn't yank or take on its own life to move things around in ways you don't want them to. I guess that interprets as the bottom seam is not made too high or too low.Material isn't super rigid but doesn't see to take on lint or fuzz balls. I wouldn't call them necessarily warm or cool material, just typical, but the weight of them feels light."
4,"It's not blue, it's not deep, but it sure is something!","I've never listened to their earlier release, other than moderately enjoying ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and hearing it played ad nauseum on the radio a few years back; so when I listened to ""She Is"" I was really happily surprised to realize they can write more than just sappy pop-rock songs! ""She Is"" is full of great ""retro"" alternative rock songs, reminding me sometimes of Material Issue with a dose of New Order, occasionally spiced with Early 90s Cure guitar work. It's become an addicting album to listen to, since each song is solid and entertaining. It's rare for me to find an album that I take to as instantly as this one did, but it was just so likeable! Some days I can't take ""Page Me Wolverine"" off of repeat. I highly recommend this album."
4,Motorola T5200,I've only owned my T5200 Talkabouts for a week so don't have lots of use yet. We did a distance test and lost effective communication at 9/10 mile. One was in a car and the other was in the top of a 2-story house. We used them between cars as well when we took two cars home from Christmas and that worked fine as long as you can see the other car. The only reason I didn't rate them 5 stars is because of the 2 mile claim. I think if they claim 2 miles then typical users should get 2 miles.
4,Very nice product.,"Been convinced that Motorola is a leading brand in FRS radios, The T5200 is an excellent decision. With the 38 Interference Reducer Codes, it brings you the neccesary privacy for your use. I reviewed all Motorola FRS radios and found T5200 to be a right price/features decision in April 2002. After May 2002, you should also consider the T5420 which is very similar, quite newer, and sometimes cheaper. Although in all the Motorola FRS Radios the battery meter is not 100% precise when using AAA rechargable batteries, batteries long a very reasonable time."
3,Who designed this anyway?,"This radio works great but the ergonomic engineers were not allowed in the building during design. They put the Push-to-Talk button right in the middle of the face of this thing so you have to talk through your hand. The PTT should be on the upper-left of the radio. The other controls are well placed and function really well. Batteries last a long time-we used a pair of them for over 10 hours across TX,LA, & MS and still had good battery strength. It's a good radio but it could be better."
3,Worked after WEB Software Download,"After installation, some functions worked, but was unable to download digital still photos. Finally went to Logitech WEB and downloaded latest software, performed Drive Image prior to installation of downloaded software and executed download. Now able to download digital still photos successfully. Software that came with WEB cam doesn't perform, even crashed my system. Logitech should also provide Technical Support Numbers for frustrated customers in the User Guide. Logitech also put disclaimer on 'latest download software', which didn't give me a warm fuzzy...but I was doing a Drive Image, so I have a fall back position."
3,"OK, but misleading","Again, I didn't know that I had to use it with another product; luckily this dog has not developed allergies like the other one, but I'm still finding live ticks"
5,NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,"When BING CROSBY became a superstar in the early thirties with records and movies,it was the JAZZ age.BING made a lot of money,alienated a few friends on his way to stardom,married DIXIE LEE,had many affairs with other women on the cover,and then after winning a battle with the bottle continued to neglect his wife who became an alcoolic and died from cancer in the early fifties.Many aspects of this biography will disappoint the CROSBY fans who thought he was a saint.The authors i think tried simply to tell the truth about the man and his complexity.You'll learn many things about him if you read that book,not only the negative side of course."
1,Big Enough to hold a random number generator,"I bought the scale because of it's retro look and the advertized precision mechanism. I use it, but I don't like it. It is bigger than my bathroom (so it resides under my bed), and the weight varies by about 6 lbs. I usually stand on it about 4 times and take an average in my head... okay, I take the low number. So what! Afterall, it's not that low."
1,Just not a quality scale,"I bought this scale because the weight max. went up to 330 but, the scale has not been accurate at any weight and not even close when weighing over 300. For people under 300 it weighed about 5 pounds over, but for people over 300 it was a shot in the dark. Sometimes weighing over by 10 pounds. It's bulky and not accurate, and definitaly not worth the 50 bucks they ask for it!!"
2,Registers different weight every time,"Each time we use this scale we weigh something different. When stepping off it doesn't return to 0. Even if you 0 the scale before each use, it shows you a different weight."
1,lillipad,"This scale was broken when I took it out of the box. I stepped on it, the pointer went to 180, and stayed there. Now I have send it back, and buy something different. I wasted alot of time and effort."
2,Sentimental purchase very unwise buy,"This lapel pin bought as a gift was a horrible choice considering the craftsmanship, & exorbitant shipping charges and pitiful packaging. Second star was given because I chose to buy and shipping charges were plainly listed. I assumed such a price for something so light would arrive extra fast with some type of unique packing. Remember the old saying about assume?"
3,They're alright,"As far as fit goes, I took a risk and ordered a half size up because of color/size availability, but they fit well, which leads me to believe that they might run a tad bit small. They are definitely comfortable, have good arch support, are breathable, and don't rub.As far as looks go, I feel plain when wearing them. When I bought them, I thought the beige shoes would look better (I wasn't into the silver trim on the white), but after seeing them in real life, I think white would probably match the sneaker-like style of the shoe a lot better than the smooth faux suede beige material. With an outfit, they will definitely not stand out, but if you're looking for a plain geox shoe (I noticed that many of the other ones feature metallic material), this one is not bad."
2,Not enough Russell,"I bought this because I'm such a fan of Russell Peters but this DVD turned out to be a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Russell is only *hosting* this show, which meant that he would come out for the introduction of every comic for 30 seconds or so. Watched the first 4 comics and I probably half-chuckled twice... If you wanna actually have a really good laugh, buy Russell's other products like Outsourced or Red, White & Brown -- I watched him perform live with Jo Koy and laughed my @$$ off.Disc 1 of this dvd features: Justin Worsham, Dean Edwards, Mike Winfield, Shane Mauss, K-von, Sebastian Maniscalco, Tapan Trivedi, Angelo Tsarouchas, B-phlat & Darren Carter.Disc 2 is Erik Griffin, Ahmed Ahmed, Edwin San Juan, Bret Ernst, Felipe Esparza, Sam Tripoli, Yoshi Obayashi, Kristeen Von Hagen.Both DVDs total about 5 hours of stand-up."
5,Bought the best of audio CD then had to get the DVD,The Best of Comics without Borders CD was so hilarious i had to get the complete season. It works out great. I can listen to it in the car and watch at home. There are a ton of funny comics talking about the funniest subjects (race and religion). I would definitely recommend both the CD and DVDs.
2,"Poorly written, poorly edited","I have three cats whose behavior I'm constantly trying to understand. I got this book from my local library. I figured I would buy the book if I liked it.In short, this book had some decent information. However, her writing style was so round about and redundant that it took away from any information she was trying to promote.There are many better books on cat behavior than this one."
1,looking for a song?,I need to know something... I need help with this one... The song right when they go off to see the first tornado.. It's sort of rock orchestra... I love that song and can't figure out what it is. Help!-Jason
3,Nostalgic purchase,It only cost me a penny and shipping so I can't complain. This is more nostalgic than anything since this was my first date with my husband. The seller was great; shipped it very quickly.
4,Pretty Good,"The recording was a little sloppy, for example, there are people talking just before songs 1 and 13. I was disappointed that not all the songs were included on the CD (missing the Eric Clapton song). They could have made a second CD to include all the other songs (other than the musical score - which is excellent)."
2,MISINFORMED,The item is misrepresented on Amazons website. This hamper is for a child and not for an adult. Now I have to return the item. Which means I have to spend money shipping it back and starting over to order the correct item. Which means spending more money. Amazon should say that it is a childs hamper like it said from Wayfair!! Unhappy
3,ok. made in Vietnam rather than the WMF Germany. Missing piece on arrival.,"The quality is ok so far. The set was made in Vietnam. Missing 6 Iced Tea spoon on arrival, will call amazon to get it fix."
3,"Gleaming and elegant, but frustrating","The flatware fits well in the hand and has a simple daily-use elegance. They have a good heft (except for the espresso spoons, which are a little light/flimsy, but that could be a necessary aspect to the tiny size).It was very frustrating, however, to realize that -- as another customer also experienced -- there were 6 missing ice tea spoons. I have contacted Amazon and expect it to correct the situation, but it raises concerns that this seems to be a repeating problem."
2,Not great,"The masala packet is useless, and while the taste of the product is bland, it seems to hide whatever other flavors you throw into it :(I'm not sure if its because it is old, or thats just how it is, but I'd avoid it and stick with the other maggi flavors or other brands"
2,Ripoff,"The version of Mighty Quinn on this album is a modern re-recording, not the original.Newer does NOT mean better, people!"
1,Broke within 1 hour of buying,"I bought this for my daughter last week. While I was putting it together, I noticed a crack in the base getting larger and larger. Maybe it was defective, but seems awfully cheap if it breaks that easy. I also thought the seat fit the base poorly. It doesn't snap on so the toilet falls apart easily if moved. I also thought the bowl opening was extremely small. My daughter is very petite and she covered the hole completely. This seat will definitely be going back."
1,Fall apart potty,I got this potty for my baby shower. I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent. I set it out to introduce it to my son( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet). We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it. Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart.Instead we bought a plain potty seat by Graco and it is excellent!!
5,Very Happy With This Potty,"I used this potty for my daughter and had no problems. She loved going on it. As with all potty training, everyone has different experiences and always will. For us, this potty was just fine. No bells and whistles which was great because my daughter had the Royal Potty and instead of concentrating on the concept she was too busy playing with the sounds. This is a basic potty and it worked perfect for us. We also placed it right next to a basket of books :-) Good Luck."
1,Not for little boys!,"I hate, hate, hate this potty! The shield will not stay on. My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying ""here you go"". It is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty. There is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning. Maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy."
2,not great at all....just a pain!,"we bought this seat --- knowing we'd need it with two kids potty training at the same time (and one who will potty train soon after.....)...there just aren't enough toilets in the house!....HOWEVER --- this seat serves as an additional toilet - when we need it....but, we really don't LIKE using it. both of my potty trainers would rather sit on a ring on the toilet....and this one seems very uncomfortable --- as they usually end up fidgeting on it - and complaining that their legs and butts hurt. you know potty-training - kids end up sitting a long time waiting for something to happen....this seat just isn't accomodating to that. we've since nixed the potty - and use just the step stool - which is okay."
2,not made for boys,"definately NOT a potty for boys. As with other reviewers, the shield does not stay on. Looking for another simple and basic potty now :o("
3,definite boy problems!,"I bought this potty on the fly at the store without looking at any reviews. I didn't really care that it converted to a stool or anything else, just needed a basic potty at a good price. And basically, this fits the bill. However, as other reviewers have noted, the deflector DOES NOT stay in place at all. It repeatedly got knocked in the bowl or fell off when my son sat down. This is a pain!! Lucky for me, he has yet to have GONE to the bathroom when it got knocked in (PT is a big struggle at our house), so I haven't had to pull it out of a mess!! Although you would prefer Safety 1st to make a product doesn't have this problem (and quite frankly, I expected better), I will offer up this solution. I bought self-adhesive extra strong velcro and made it so the deflector stays in place, but still can be removed for cleaning or when its not needed."
2,Not the worst seat ... not the best either,"I have twin girls and before I even allowed them to use the seats, the pee guard fell off. One of my girls actually needs the guard because of the way the stream hits the bowl, it bounces out. This is an impossible seat to keep clean, too. It tips way too easily and I've cleaned many spills because of it. The plastic guards on the lid fell off immediately. If this is the only seat you can get your hands on, it will serve its purpose. However, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has a choice!"
1,Don't waste your money or your time!,I just purchased this potty today for my son. He is just getting used to sitting on the potty and not yet using it. He likes the handles because it helps him feel stable while sitting. He will sit on it but the opening is WAY TOO SMALL! I don't see how any child can use it without making a mess. We will be returning this potty and getting another one. We will probably go with the Baby Bjorn. Don't waste your money or your time on this one!
1,I can't imagine a worse potty.,"I can't not review this potty. I must try to spare other parents. The footprint is smaller than the sitting surface, so it always tips and wobbles when she tries to sit on it. This instability scares her. When it wobbles, the lid falls closed on her back, which scares her. (The lid is light and doesn't hurt, but still.) It's filled with little crevices, which I am sure would be impossible to clean if she weren't too scared of it to actually pee in it. It's trying to do too much, and it certainly does a crummy job of each task. This potty has actually set back our potty-training process."
1,"Not for little girls, either","This potty is driving me crazy. Unless my daughter sits on it in a particular way, she ends up messing up the floor, AND SHE'S A GIRL! I don't know what the problem is; perhaps the hole in the seat is simply too small. If I position her in the correct position, a mess is avoided, but she can't find that ""perfect position"" by herself. That's a lot to ask of a two year old. She has no problem at all with a different padded potty seat that sits on top of the toilet."
2,Tips easily,"Bought this potty seat for my daughter to begin potty training. I liked the fact that it could be turned into a step stool and would eventually fit over an adult sized toilet. Unfortunately this potty isn't going to work for our training. My daughter is petite and trying to get her seated properly is painful as the potty tips over CONTINUOUSLY as she tries to sit. Needless to say it tips when she gets off too. The lid never stays up and always falls over onto her while she's trying to do her business. Maybe this potty will be OK for her when she's older but for now we'll be using it as a step, maybe."
2,"Looks nice, but it's junk.","We bought it for our daughter. She hates it, and at this point would rather hide in a corner to pee than have to sit on this thing. The hole is itty bitty, and she's very uncomfortable sitting on it. It tips over very easily, and when that happens, pee and poop go everywhere. It does indeed fall apart, as other reviews have noted. And the interior of the potty is very difficult to clean, with way too many nooks and crannies that can be accidentally filled with pee and poop. As a result, it literally stinks all of the time.The step stool is too short to help my tall three year old reach the potty when using the step stool / insert feature. She has to heft herself up and gingerly scoot back to get herself over the teeny tiny hole. Thoroughly junk.I got it because it was cheap, plain, and seemed like it would be perfectly serviceable. No, it's just cheap and plain. Now we need to find something else, and I'm cranky about having wasted money on this piece of junk first."
3,I've seen better,"We bought this potty for our daughter when she was about 15-months-old. The design seemed great. The construction was good and sturdy, nothing broken. The seat DOES snap onto the base. It snaps over a little lip on the front of the base. Not too difficult to figure out. Unfortunately, our daughter, now 2-years-old, is very tiny for her age, barely 20 lbs. The hole in the seat is a bit too big for her, making the seat uncomfortable. Also, she is a little short so her feet don't touch the ground when she is sitting on it, which also makes it a little difficult for her seat herself. I've been doing a little more research and think that due to her size, the BabyBjorn Little Potty would be a better potty for her and its even less expensive than this one."
1,daughter quickly overgrew this potty,my daughter is not even 2 yrs old and she is already having a hard time fitting into the potty -- i think this is the case for other types of potty seats too so i'll be trying the type u attach to the adult seat and see how it goes.
1,too noisy,"This makes whirring, zapping and grinding-ish noises that bother me to have it plugged in in my bedroom, where I intended to use it. So I only plug it in every once in awhile during waking hours, when I'm out of the room. Disappointing."
1,Ionic,This product only last one day and then you have to clean the plate. If you don't it will make a zapping sound and trip your breaker. I would not recommend this product.
1,?Closet cleaner?,"Like all the little units, they do a little!When it worked it was Weak-OK for a very small closet/bath w/stallSince it failed to work/at all after a Week??I cannot reccomend anyone spend there money on it!"
1,no results...,"I have had this plug in above my dogs potty pads, and it makes zero difference. The odor is still there, and it makes a weird buzzing noise which can very annoying."
2,Mini Ionic Air Purifier,"I don't really notice any improvement in air condition, as I had hoped for. I use it in the kitchen, where there are a lot of odors: cooking, tobacco smoke, cat litter box, garbage, etc. Having the ionizer on doesn't seem to make any difference. I would not recommend this product."
5,Good for small spaces,"I have two of these units I like them so much. They are good for the bathroom and offer that wonderful ozone rain scent. I have another unit in the front room of my small apartment and it contributes to a sense of well being in a small space. Energy efficient, a little fussy to clean, better than any fake air freshener scent and good for you!"
1,Poor Quality Control- started sparking after 2 days use,"I bought this to help keep the air cleaner in my home office to try to reduce the amount of dust that gathers.After the first day, I checked to see how much dirt had accumulated, and there was virtually nothing.The product ran silently for two days and did emit an odor which smelled like a mixture of canned air and the odor of plastic blister packs so many products are sold in (including this one)Then on the third day of use, I started hearing a zapping sound in the office which I traced to the Ionic Pro unit. Upon further inspection, it was SPARKING inside, so I disconnected it, and am returning it."
4,Makes a Difference,I travel a lot and have two cats. My wife complained constantly of the smell even with the (various) odor absorbing cat litter(s) and electric autoscoop box. I can't say that odors are COMPLETELY gone but MUCH better especially when the box goes for some days without changing. The proof is my wife has stopped complaining. What could be more compelling? Would recommend for this application without question. Likely good for other odor problems as well but no direct experience. Low cost makes taking the plunge a pretty low risk.
3,Made funny popping sounds,I was happy with this purchase for my bathroom. I live in an apartment building and I have neighbors that smoke. The smoky air would come in through my bathroom and I needed something small that would help keep my air clean. This worked for a few months and then I started to hear funny sounds coming from it. Popping and crackling as thought something was wrong with the electrical components. I had to unplug and I haven't used it since.
4,wall plug in ionic air purifier,The purifier works good in a small room. It doesn't stay plugged in flat against the wall though. Its a little top heavy . Would be better if I could plug it in upside down
3,"Works OK, Expected More","I bought this product and plugged it in right next to the cat's liter box, expecting that I could walk in the room and not be hit with liter box oder. I was wrong. While the intensity of it is less (I have an old cat), I do wish that I couldn't tell when she had just been there."
1,AIR PURIFIER IS HORRIBLE DONT BUY!!!,"When i first got this item in was so exited because my air was filthy in my home so when i got it i plugged it in and right away thier was this horrible metalic smell, then after one week i opened it to clean it and it only filters microscopic dust thats all!!! Now this is in my junk box siting in my garrage i dont know why this is a filter!"
2,Hope this product works,"Amazon.com does not provide the dimention of products, so I was surprized that this product was so small. It makes noise when being on for a long time and that's a little scary. It's hard to tell if it works but I hope it does."
4,Does the Job,This is the second one of these I purchased. When you walk near it the air smells like you walked past an open window. I have a dog and three cats. I also smoke. I put one in the kitchen and one by the couch. It helps a lot. The only draw back is that you have to wipe the rods often.
1,Background Music for PC,I purchased CD based on it being an audio. It is a data CD. ONLY buy if you're looking for a screensaver.
4,Quick & Easy Guide to Statistics,"As a Phd student in sociology, I find this booklet indispensable as a quick and easy reference guide to all the basics of social science statistical analysis. After going through more complicated texts such as Lewis-Beck's ""Applied Regression: an Introduction"" and Berry and Feldman's ""Multiple Regression in Practice"", I find this small booklet extremely helpful and clear in its explanations of the logic of basic bivariate and multiple regression analysis, as well as significance testing. It is quite useful as a tool to review the basic methods of analysis, and I especially like the list of regression assumptions at the end, all of which we had to memorize and explain for qualifying exams! I would only request a separate section and more detailed explanation of the Chi-square test, complete with application examples."
4,Data Analysis; An Introduction,"An excellent primer for basic data analysis. It starts at the beginning of data gathering and discusses basic application of analysis; to include univariate statistics, measures of association, significance testing, simple and multiple regression.I need a reference source to brush the dust off of my college statistics for a project, this book fit the bill for what I required and would recommend it for others. It is not a complex text, rather a booklet which helped me recall the basics of data analysis."
4,Liberating and enlightening!,"After searching extensively for books on this topic, I bought Grady's book, hoping it would provide me with what I was looking for. I wasn't disappointed. ""25 Tough Questions"" was an excellent read that helped stave off the sexist way of thinking that plagues the Church. Overall I was satified in the answers, but I did feel that the same reasoning was used too often. After reading the first few chapters, the logic behind the answers becomes predictable."
1,not as good as I expected,The book was not very meaty. Probably could have been condensed to about 12 Questions...
1,25 Tough Questions abou Women and the Church,"The author begins with a presumtive assumption about what the Bible is saying about his subject. From there he sets out to prove his point ignorning the most common rules for Biblical interpretaion including even his claim that certain passages do not mean what they say. Take this book as a indication of why women are struggling with the subject rather than resolving their struggle. The author is at best ""dangerous"" for women and clergy who are seeing truth in God's word."
2,Only for the beginner,"I am already a business owner and was looking to reshape or retool my business. This book is the basics of starting a business. If you have never been a business owner, there are many helpful ideas to consider in this book, but if you know anything about business, this book is a real yawner."
5,Incredible foundation for your business,"This is a phenomenal book: very challenging and practical at the same time. It challenges you to carefully think through the process of starting your business. It's serious business, with so much at stake, so why not start out on the right foot!? Highly recommended!"
3,its ok,This lubricant is ok but it is not tingling and does not even smell like peppermint. I probably wont buy this again.
4,The Worlds Best Lube!,"you don't need a ton of it, it tends to go a little sticky (like sugar) but it works great!"
5,I like it,I am using this in my theater for my center and it sure sounds lovely. I especially like that Polk sends the performance enclosure along with this product and this was one of my main reasons for the purchase. Sounds great with my other Polk in-walls.
5,Most Comfortable Shoes Ever,This is my first time buying Naturalizer shoes and I can honestly say that these shoes are among the most comfortable shoes I own. They look brand new but fit like I've had them for years. They go well with skirts and pants. I'm already looking for my next pair.
3,good stuff but missing parts,"I received a still sealed package that contained all the wiring needed to hook up an amplifyer except for the RCA cables. all the power wires and speaker wires are great. the power blocks, capacitor, and battery terminals are great looking."
3,Good for a craft box,"The entire case is plastic, which makes it lightweight and resistant to rust. I use it for art supplies at this point. The price was right, as I bought it via Prime and needed it in a hurry, but it still would have been nice to see an image of the inside and the tray, which comes unattached. This would be great for a kid's first box, but I wouldn't recommend it for a serious fisherman."
3,Tango Got A Little Better But Can Still Do More,"Well atleast this CD is much more improved from thier last one they came out with,. but still It needs some work,.. or maybe just change the artist that are on here. Still only gave it a 3 star rating out of 5"
4,Helpful tips,These book would be very good for seminars or even in the classroom. There are very good tips and resources in this book to help you to become very successful in marketing your events.
3,"Good information, but outdated","This book was my required text for my class, so it was not by choice. My professor and I realized alot of the information was outdated. not sure if there is a newer edition..."
2,Didn't help me at all,$65 on a book that's only based on theory and didn't give any insights or executions to help get the job done. A compete waste of money when you can buy a better book for less than $20.
1,THE MYTH OF PROGRESS,"A particular sentence in this book made me laugh so much - and I found it symptomatic of much of the thinking throughout. The line goes - paraphrasing - that it is the progress of mankind which has led from alchemy to chemistry, from number mysticism to mathematics, from astrology to astronomy and from the cave to the skyscraper. I don't doubt that the first three examples mark a greater exapansion of human understanding ... but skyscrapers? This would seem to be a case of conflating human civilization with Americanism, which of course was the point often in Rand's argument. But as the architect Cedric Price once said (in criticising The Fountainhead), when you can afford to live in the 40th floor suite of the Hilton you will hardly be complaining about psychological deprivation. But Rand was just as nave about these matters as was Le Corbusier. I would recommend reading George Henrik von Wright's essay ""The myth of progress""."
4,I have a question...,"can a rational person please email me and answer my question? here it is: If Ayn Rand's philosophy was so un-original (as some people posting here seem to think) than how is it that they never got recognized for their thinking? Miss Rand gained international fame (whether good or bad is not finally the point) for her thinking, so why did the ""hundreds"" of other thinkers that went before her never gain recognition for their very ""good"" and ""rational"" work? how is that possible? oh, and if you will look at review number 10, I am afraid that the person who denounced Miss Rand ever so loudly forgot that 5 stars is the BEST, not worst, rating. so much for ""not so cleverly disguised facism!"" I gave this book 4 stars because it contains material written by Ayn Rand herself, the (sometimes) drivel written by Peter Schwartz is not that great, except for maybe 1 or 2 essays. I recommend it for those who can open their minds to rational thought, it may be too late for some."
5,Devastating Analysis of Today's Trend,"If you are are serious about ideas and sympathetic to today's fashionable causes, such as feminism, environmentalism and multi-culturalism, this book will make you think again.Ayn Rand's essays are clear, incisive and compelling. Peter Schwartz's contributions are equally lucid. He has the remarkable ability to cut through the rationalizations and smokescreens thereby exposing the essence of an ideology. His attention to detail is astonshing. Ever considered why environmentalists use the term ""environment"" rather than ""nature""? Schwartz has.Peter Schwartz has taken on a tough assignment; few question the validity of the causes he has in his sights. His is an unpopular position, but after reading this book you might wonder why.If you really want to understand today's trends, Ayn Rand and Peter Schwartz offer a clear and cogent analysis unlike any other I have read."
5,Schwartz's Essays are outstanding.,"Peter Schwartz's three new essays on feminism, environmentalism, and multiculturalism are excellent editions to this updated version of Ayn Rand's book ""The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution."" The essays demonstrate the latest radicalism of these movements that the New Left has given rise to, as Mr. Schwartz uncompromisingly demonstrates the essence of all three.Joseph Kellard Jkaxiom3@aol.com"
2,A litle better,"A slight improvement over volume 3, but still not the best of the genre. At least these are not just disco standards dressed up in gay themed packaging, but actually feature some artists who's hits made their mark predominantly in gay clubs.I could still recommend a dozen better compilations, though."
5,All of the HOT PRODUCTIONS CD's represent the era that was -,"""Gay Disco"" ... today, the music is mindless in most Gay clubs - tribal and house beats, no songs, no campiness and too drug related to be listened to at home - not to mention in the 90's when house (unlike these awesome HiNRG sparklers) the theme turned from fun to political, and you know what - that's boring - so buy these and have fun!!!, this is music, with songs you can dance to."
2,Good Beat But Not Much Meat,Songs had some interesting backgrounds but overall the melodies and lyrics were largely unoriginal and wanting. Thanks but no thanks.
2,Bill Readings' University in Ruins is far better,"Menand largely overlooks the corporatization of the university as an instigating factor in the research/teaching divide. From his exalted purview at the very privileged Harvard University, Menand presumes to tell the rest of us what's wrong with academe, something he ultimately knows very little about when it comes to state institutions. Bill Readings's The University in Ruins is a far better book, both in terms of diagnostics and solutions."
1,No Kindle Support So Don't Buy It,This publisher like some others are holding on by not publishing for the Kindle because they want to sell their more profitable hardbacks. I resent this plan and will blackball any publisher using this tactic.
1,NOT the shirt shown in the picture!!!,"I paid $150 for this shirt ($120 plus rush shipping for Christmas). What I got was a teal green Dan Marino jersey BUT it did not have White numbers or the name in White. Instead, the number 13 and name ""Marino"" were the same color green as the shirt, and then outlined with the orange stitching. You really cannot distinguish the name or numbers on this shirt. I paid this HUGE price, because I wanted an official jersey. This is definitely not official looking. It looks like a cheap knock-off from China. At no time did the Miami Dolphins have a jersey with numbers that were the same color as the shirt itself. I am pretty upset to have paid such a high price and then not get at all what was advertised!"
5,Dolphins Football Jersey,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he really liked it. It was something he would never buy for himself. When he opened it he was shocked that I went out of my way for this jersey.
2,Change brings diappointment,I love Hiroshima. They have a very special sound that is both unique and endearing. That is why I was very diappointed with this CD. I think they tried to do something different which is okay but when you lose who you are it is going too far. I hope Hiroshima learns from this. I don't expect them to keep playing the same music all the time but I do expect them to remember why they have such loyal fans.
1,A Big Disappointment,I believe Hiroshima tried to change their successful music formula with this CD. I wasn't very thrilled with the changes. This is the worst Hiroshima CD I have (and I have them all). I hope their next one brings back the old elements in their music that has made them one of the best bands out there.
2,Not Up To Par,Not up to Par for Hiroshima material. I'd buy another cd if you really want t ohear Hiroshima. Too many vocals not their style.
5,Awesome,Love this cd. Hiroshima definately outdid themselves on this one. I purchased this one for a friend. He also loves it.
2,Save the instrumental tracks but scrap the rest!,"I've been a Hiroshima fan since the 80s, but this disc didn't live up to my expectations. I've always felt that Hiroshima's strength was in creating great instrumental pieces, which is why it was a mistake on their part to flood this CD with stuff from Hamish & Kimaya Seward. Don't get me wrong, I think that the two of them are good vocalists but they're not Hiroshima material.On the positive side, ""Timekeeper"" is the best instrumental on this album. It reminds me of autumn fog rolling through the Oregon forest! ""Koto Blues"" is nice to listen to on rainy nights. ""Urban world"" is busy, reminding me of another great instrumental of theirs called ""East."" Walking with angels is nice, but not long enough.Experimenting is ok, but it should be kept to a minimum just in case if it doesn't work out."
5,Great replacement for a GREAT food processor,"We have had this Cuisinart DLC-X food processor for over 25 years. It is a workhorse in our house, and the this is the first time the bowl & lid has been replaced. The blades are still as sharp as new. Good for another 25 years. Engineered to perform!!"
4,A touch of color -- almost impossible to put on too much,"This is technically a highlighter, not a blush; but I use it as a blush most of the time. My skin is very light (terms like 'ivory' and 'porcelain' appear in the names of all my foundations) and this adds a nice bit of color without seeming too red or like too much. I actually like to use a kabuki brush to apply it."
3,Message is clear and sweet,This is a different yet interesting sounding production touched by various genres. I kinda wish all the songs had the cosmic clubbing sounds.
1,Disappointing! They sound like everybody else.,"I was very disappointed with this CD. Nearly all the songs sound the same. POG now sounds like all the other bands and singing groups out thier. POG had a distinctive sound that separated them from the other groups. That was why I liked them and bought their CDs. This CD is even worse than Steady On. Hopefully, they will recover from this and produce a better sounding and more varied in style next time."
1,"Bring back the real POG, please!","I have to whole heartedly agree with the reviewer who wished they had previewed the album before buying. This album is so...not up to par with the group's past efforts. I didn't bother to listen to the cd a second time. I gave the album one star because of one song: ""This is YOUR land"" - absolutely beautiful, with harmonies and a rich love and meaning conveyed. Other songs fell flat."
5,"Bonfa, Brazilian Master","This has been an extremely hard to find audio recording from the legendary Brazilian guitarist/composer Luiz Bonfa. Amazingly, the producers included other takes of some of Bonfa's classics which I have never before heard.Bonfa's guitar virtuosity and composition work are a joy for both guitarists and non-guitarists to enjoy.I consider this to be a 'must have' collectionThe title has been changed from the original A Voila de Luiz Bonfa to Solo in Rio. Buy it - you won't be disappointed."
5,The Chairman loves this!,"I am in awe. His superb musicianship surpasses my other favorite, the Jobim Songbook."
3,Very nice but worth the price?,"It does cut down on the wind buffeting by a significant amount. It's also well made. But for the life of me I can't figure out why it costs this much. Materials alone would have to cost well under $50.I give it 5 stars on function, design and effectiveness. But it gets only 1 star for its inflated cost. Thus the overall 3 star rating.I highly recommend it but only if you're willing to pay more than it's worth."
4,Wind deflector,I heard from other people who have purchased wind deflectors that they were good. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. Even at speeds of 65 mph we didn't fell any wind inside the car. My wife loves it since her hair doesn't get messed up and papers are blown around inside the car. It also let you drive in colder weather with the top down since the heat stays inside the passenger area longer.The only drawback is its price
3,Excellent with a caveat.,"Love how it works reducing the noise and excessive wind. After the install, removing and replacing is a snap, just as advertised. HOWEVER, the material should be more durable since it DOES get removed occasionally and put into the trunk. When things end up on top of it while in the trunk, even IN the bag, the screen rubs on the frame because of the groceries (whatever) that you placed on top. This leads to friction, which leads to holes in the screen."
1,Weight for a better scale,"After one year of light use, the dial sticks, then springs to some weight. In the end, I always weigh the same amount, though my doctor's scale tells me differently. Every time I step off the scale, the dial resets to some new start point - 2 lbs, negative 3 lbs, rarely zero. The scale has a hard time with weights under 50lbs. (my son doesn't register a weight). The dial IS very big and VERY easy to read. I bought this for the retro look and the supposed ""precision"" accuracy. Given the size (huge) and the scales inability to weigh anything accurately, I would not purchase this again."
2,Nothing to write home about,"If Eduardo Mendoza is considered one of Spain's greatest writers, it is not because of this book. There is nothing here that you haven't read a thousand times before. You could read this book in the dentist's waiting room. It wil take you all of about 10 minutes (max) to figure out what will happen. Anyone looking for good 20th century Spanish fiction should read Javier Marias. End of story."
4,Smaller is not always better,"This compact, stylish and catchy item is very lightweight and attractive, but seems to have very short frequency. I tried it from home to outdoor and could only get a block or 2 of frequency. So unless both parties are really outdoors (beach or park) your frequency is really a little more than a mile."
3,May want privacy codes.,"I was having fun with my radios, until I went skiing with some friends and they had the talkabout 5200 with privacy codes. I hadn't realized the value of those ... they basically increase the number of channels a huge amount. Probably worth the extra money to get them."
5,brilliant & surprising turn for fsol,"FSOL again prove their talent by pulling this psychedelic rabbit out of their hat. Sounding like prime Love & Rockets or Spiritualized filtered through a billowy digital mesh, The Isness proves that they still have a statement to make and the courage to change. The real surprise here isn't stylistic turnabout as much as the unexpected warmth and soul of this record. ""Divinity"" is the prettiest song they've written yet.Ignore the naysayers - they probably didn't really get this band the last time around either."
4,FSOL reborn..... in the 70's...,"You can't help but admire FSOL for their past influences on the world of organic electronica, and expression in general. This album comes as a bit of a surprise to loyal fans or anyone vaguely familiar with their stylings. It seems that Cobain and Dougans have fallen into a state of mind expanded bliss ... ( take that how you will) ....... In a nutshell, I'd say they took a trip to the 70's and lost their keys. I'm expecting them to come to my door at any minute to preach their beliefs.... Buy this album with an open mind and expect to take a well produced trip.........."
2,Don't expect the old FSOL!,"Being an old FSOL fan I bought this record with reservation. I was skeptical as to whether they would be back in their old form. Well kids....they're not. Don't buy this record expecting to hear the old FSOL because quite frankly it sounds nothing like them. They should have released this under a new side project name and marketed it to the indie rock scene. I rate this record two stars as an FSOL record, however, it's actually pretty decent in its own right. This is pure psycedelic rock, highly recommended for Pink Floyd/David Bowie fans. As a psychedelic rock record I would give this four stars."
5,hello is anybody out there?,"this is probably the greatest record I've listened to in a long time.this is what sgt.pepper and electric ladyland would have sounded like if they had the electronics and recording studios of today.and the production is just incredible.these guys are just amazing...this cd was given to me as a gift,never new anything about fsol,now its one of my favoite cdsthis is a must buy cd.its worth the investment,you won't be dissapointed."
1,waste of time...total [junk],"You really have to be kidding me.After waiting all this time for a new album from FSOL, they deliver a complete joke.It is a pretty good joke, but it costed me [money]. Why did anyone tell me how bad this was?If you have not heard this yet, better download it first.For those who are long time fans of FSOL, you will be disappointed.trust me."
4,No more singing please!,"As an avid fan of psychedelic and ambient music, I think the music on this album is fantastic. But please, FSOL, no more singing!! I point to ""Divinity"" and ""Galaxial Pharmaceutical"" as the principal examples of the vocalist's serious lack of ability. Absent the singing, these two songs would be much better. ""Divinity"" is so bad that I must skip the whole section of the song containing the singing. The music is good enough without any vocals; but if conveying your message through mediocre (if not downright awful) lyrics is that important to you guys then I think you can afford to hire someone with at least a tolerable voice."
1,is this FSOL?,"I'd have to agree - this is a joke! Nothing like their old style and i'd have to ask 'Why change'? If you like FSOL dont buy this albumn, instead stick to FSOL at their best and buy ISDN."
5,Amazing - by far their best!!!!!,"This cd is remarkably good - one of the most beautiful, complex, breathtaking recordings I've heard in a long time. FSOL's classic LifeForms is fine, but it's a little too one-note for me. This is a much richer, complex mix, using many different instruments and synth sounds. It's all really engaging, psychedelic, at times trippy music.I just wish I could find more stuff like this."
3,Different...,"I personally liked the more ambient style found in their prior work, especially Dead Cities-downright haunting. I was hoping that this album might include the awesome ""Landmass"" songs and more of those styles, but that didn't happen. FSOL is remade each time they have done an album in the past, but this particular resurrection is one that didn't blow me away."
2,"If I wanted pre-Dark Side Floyd, I would've bought it.....","I fervently believe that those who praise this album never heard of them prior to 2000. For their first album to be released in the 21st Century, this is the last thing I would've expected. The world doesn't need another unplugged album. Like so many others, I too waited for 6 years for the next FSOL and what do I get? An imitation of another band. Granted, it might have sounded better in 1972 (under that other band's name), but get with the times. What happened to that high tech silicon symphony that tempted me to take up computer hacking as a career? Perhaps they need to take notes from Gary Numan on how to gracefully progress its sound without alienating its following."
1,awful,"This cd is not the old FSOL, but instead is something completely different - in a bad way. The music is just total boring and dull nonsense, unlike their earlier work. This sounds like they were not even trying to make good music, but instead were just trying to fill an album with whatever they could in order to sell it for quick profit. ..."
2,McAfee creates pop-up nightmare,"Be forewarned that once your year's worth of free updating of virus files expires, McAfee ironically begins popping up repeat windows warning you of impending expiration, and then expiration, and this continues and even presents multiple pop-ups during one session. I've written them repeatedly and you might as well contact the Great Wall. I hate to switch but any company that does that to a paid customer exhibits brazen insensitivity to the whole spam nightmare. They're not the same company I thought they were, apparently."
5,McAfee personal firewall 2004 v. 5.0 review 2/1/04,"Re: McAfee personal firewall 2004 v. 5.0I am using Windows XP.Bought McAfee Firewall because it had the best consistent ratings. Symantec Norton anti-virus came with my system. Norton works great and is easy to use, especially getting updates automatically. Bought new computer 3 months back and had been only using XP firewall. Have been lucky.McAfee is very easy to install. Even left XP firewall enabled with no conflects. First time Norton anti-virus and 3 other utilities needed online updates, McAfee asks info about each, enters info, then no futher questions, when doing updates.Although I don't have McAfee anti-virus installed, McAfee firewall gives up dates on newest versions of viruses. Then I can cross check with Norton. I also use online Port Checker to keep McAfee firewall honest. Always checks out positive. Firewall works for me.Happy Camper - Salem Oregon"
1,"Crash, Crash, Crash","Do not buy this product. I had the previous versions, and thought it was time to improve. All that improved was my ability to restore my system. Two of the files kept me crashing daily. After three attempts with customer service, I deleted Personal Firewall. I wish I had listened to a few other reviews!!"
1,Soft ware crashes computer,"I resently purchased McAfee's Internet Security software and it has been a nightmare. The privacy service soft ware has crashed my computer 3 times and I have had to restore my hard drive 3 times to get rid of the files. I have chatted on line with McAfee on two different occasions and both times their fix only made matters worse. I have spent a week trying to fix the problems this software has caused. If the privacy service is running I cannot access the internet and if I try to access with the privacy service on the internet window opens repeatedly until the hard drive crashes and then you start all over again. Now what do you do, after reading reviews on both McAfee and Norton I think being hacked may be safer."
2,Big disappointment,"I was a happy McAfee customer with my previous purchase - version 6.0. My update period ended, so I opted to upgrade to the current version - 8.0. I have been unable to get it loaded. The installation process hangs up. It is a known problem, they have a solution posted on their web-site. Evidentally, the old version does not completely uninstall, preventing the new version from installing. But the steps they suggest don't work. I tried their online chat support FOUR times. Each agent gave me additional steps to try - deleting more and more information from the Registry. It still doesn't work. I gave up. I am going back to my old version 6 until I can get Norton's software ordered. I don't do anything fancy on my PC. When software loads, I let it follow its default settings. So with this ""standard"" set-up, why don't installs work? What a huge disappointment."
1,Poor Quality,I agree with another reviewer.Quality changed this year.Fabric too thin. They are not tight anymore.Danskin Women's Supplex Capri
4,excellent,"The reason I gave 4 is the size, which is really huge!!! If you are in the middle is preferable to choose the smaller..My previous danskin is about 15 years old!!! excellent quality!! I couldn't resist buying an other one!"
5,Danskin Capri,"Great capris--well made and description is exact. I like to use these to wear under dresses and I was happy that there was no ""shine"" to them and don't look like exercise pants! Really love them!"
3,"A Message of Warning, Presented in a Poor Quality Production","I bought this DVD with quite a bit of skepticism after hearing numerous interviews with the author, and given all of the information on the internet about the book The Harbinger and the videos of Johnathan Cahn discussing this project, you really don't need to spend your money to buy the materials because it's all out there.However, if you want the information all in one place, this DVD is fine. I don't have a problem with the content of the DVD, but for the price WND and even here at Amazon, of the DVD and the poor quality it is, just know it's not great quality.The production quality of this DVD is pretty bad. It's obvious the music and video they used is from VideoBlocks, a relatively popular video and audio library of materials. And I'd also say that the production moved pretty slowly. What they provided in about two hours, could've been easily condensed to an hour."
5,a must view,"Isaiah 9:10 is a must view video. If you ever want to know what will happen to America in the future, you need to see what happened to Israel in the past. It is a well written document with facts. It is an eye opening video about what will happen to America and the American people. I liked it and will view it again."
5,Amazing detail and awesome revelation,The vendor of this product was very polite and courteous prompt in delivery of the merchandise. The Isaiah 9:10 Harbinger is an awesome revelation which ties current events of 9/11 to today. The author really breaks down the critical hour in which we live in America.
4,Interesting,"this has a lot of information in it. I had already read the book, The Harbinger"", so was looking forward to watching this. the book has more detailed information for anyone that wants to learn and understand all of it better."
4,Interesting,This is an interesting and thought provoking DVD. It did get a little repetitive and slow in places. Good food for thought.
2,Questionable theological jump,"To me, this was just another poor comparison of a nation founded on democracy (the USA) to God's chosen people in the Old Testament. I personally believe it's apples and oranges.I also think it can be dangerous looking for small, obscure verses from nearly 3000 years ago and applying them to events that only took place in the last 10 years.I also wonder how much of this is politically driven, and was wondering if this would be made if there was a Republican in the white house. And that was before I found this is really all centered around Edward's misuse of this in a speech.But that's just me."
5,Must see for every American!,This is a jaw-dropping presentation by Rabbi Cahn of facts surrounding the 9/11 terrorist attack and subsequent reaction of the American leadership.
5,Buy This,It was just like new! And everyone needs to view this! It is a final warning to America and it's leaders!
5,Great video,"This video details visually what is discussed in his book The Harbinger. I read the book in one day, couldn't put it down, and this video backs up everything perfectly. A must see for all who are concerned about America's future."
4,A Needy Message,It's not that Isaiah 9:10 was written for America but the parallels (in most cases) are striking. The presentation moves a little too slow but the message needs to be heard.
5,Great! Great! And more Great!,"Just an excellent resource. Worth having in your library. I am presently using it with a congregation I am pastoring to help them understand where we are as a country. If this holds true, an adventure is coming that I had never would have imagined! Great research done by the author and well put together by production company."
5,Companion to The Harbinger,"This movie will put together in video what you have already read. If you don't like toread, this will tell you all you need to know about the current path that America is on! Time to wake up people!We should learn from history, not repeat it!!"
5,The Isaiah 9:10 Judgement,"This DVD follows scripture perfectly - really gives you something to think about. I have lent this DVD to several people (one person called it ""awesome"") and have bought one for our granddaughter, who had requested that she wanted to see and share it with some of her neighbors."
3,Barely a documentary and not really convincing,"I love hearing and reading about end time prophecies. WIth that said I'm hardly a skeptic, but I found the conclusions in this documentary not really convincing. I was all geared up to watch the film and eventually discernment kicked in at about harbinger number 3 and I began to think to myself that these connections to scripture could easily be searched out. As for the film itself, it hardly felt like a well produced documentary and seemed to get boring fast (especially if you don't subscribe to the writers theories). If you really want to see it but feel hard pressed to spend the money on so so reviews just do what I do, buy it. watch it. sell it."
5,Gets to the point,"I have the book ""The Harbinger"" by the same author and it's a lot more fun to read because it is written in novel form, but this video is very informative and gets to the point faster than the book. I would recommend owning both."
1,boring version,"I saw a different version on youtube that was great, this isn't it. I do not recommend this version. Keep on looking!"
2,THE ISAIAH 9:10 REVIEW,"THIS MOVIE WAS INTERESTING, A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE NORMAL RELIGIOUS FILMS, BUTGOOD VIEWING FOR THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS."
2,Jewish Dogma,I was disappointed with this presentation for reviewing the jewish history has little to do with foretelling America's future; and this CD fails miserably.
4,Very Helpful After the Book!,"While I found the book thought provoking and intriguing, it is also, for me, complicated & a little difficult to keep it all straight. The video was a great aid to me, and I was able to ""see"" all the harbingers in a line, so to speak. I guess I'm a visual person, so what I'm saying is that it helped me to visualize the timeline and framework of the story so that it made more sense & fit together.If Rabbi Cahn is even partially right about all of it, America the great needs to wake up in a hurry and turn back to a gracious, loving & forgiving God before it's too late! Whether or not you believe, this book & video makes you think, and the video is a great aid in that process! I have already recommended both to several of my friends & family."
5,Good DVD but I liked the book better,"If you don't read then this is a ""must see"" but it is a lot of information to absorb in such a short span of time. I liked reading the book better because it gave me more time to chew on what I was taking in."
4,Isaiah 9:10 Judgement,Everyone should watch this video. It is really eye opening about what is happening to America and why. We need to turn back to God as a nation before it is too late.
4,unleashing the beast,Very interesting book. I recommend reading for all. This is just not a good idea for a review for Amazon. I don't like this review.
4,Isaiah 9:10 Judgment,"I found the premise of the Biblical prophecy in ""Isaiah9:10 Judgment"" interesting, but have some reservations because it is, after all, only the interpretation of one Rabbi. It certainly gives pause for thought, however."
4,Worth the money,This movie put together a lot of good comparisons; it was too wordy. Restated things too many times. I believe that History repeats itself and that there are reliable prophesies in the bible.
5,"USA MINUS PRAYER (IN SCHOOL,IN PUBLIC) MINUS BELIEF EQUALS DOWNFALL",WE REALLY DO NOT BELIEVE IN OUR BIBLE THESE DAYS! TOO MANY OF US TAKE GOD'S WORD TOO LIGHTLY. TOO MANY PEOPLE THINK GOD IS 'DEAD' AND HE ONLY SPEAKS THRU HIS WRITTEN WORD.THE USA IS GOING TO LEARN THE HARD WAY THE THE LIVING GOD OF ISRAEL IS REALLY THE LIVING GOD OF ISRAEL!
5,Provocative,"Provocative and insightful. Jonathan speaks God's truth, for such a time as this and we should heed this information. God's word will always accomplish was it was set out to accomplish!"
4,Interesting and amazing.,"This book makes one think about hearing an noticing warnings. Repentance. I would recommend buying it, then passing it around. Don't see this prior to reading the Harbinger. It ruins the suspense of the book."
5,Everyone should get this!!,America is at a cross road--we need to return to our roots as a Godly nation. Jonathan shows how God is calling us to do that and how we are being warned by God if we don't what could happen to America. He also gives you facts that will amaze you starting with the terroist attack of 9-11 until now. Must see!
5,So true if we believe the bible,Enjoyed this video very much. It describes what our future holds and it's scary. Wish everyone could see it and believe it.
5,Isaiah 9:10 judgement,"Biblically based, historically accurately, sobering to relate to this stiff necked culture, It will happen as it happened in the past Enlightens and enlivens the book, hand in glove"
2,not too great,"As is the problem with most educational texts, so much of the material is common sense. You'll find yourself wondering, is this research? The book is well-organized and covers many topics, but no earth-shattering material is presented."
3,Great music - questionable CD mastering,"I thought I'd put a cautionary note out there for anyone considering picking up these discs. The music is great. However, I find it very annoying how its been converted to stereo on this CD. Sounds are very distinct from one channel to the next but the noise floor drops to zero (like your headphone wire is intermittent for one channel) for some sections in sharp distinction from the very audible background ""noise"" from the original analog recordings.Now maybe this was intended but it wouldn't be an original recording choice (this is all analog) - it seems like a product of the mastering process putting null where you want the feint echo. To my ears, a more uniform noise floor would be much better and as this is presented its hard to listen to sections of certain songs. Woman's Dub is a good example.I might try to create a mono mix it annoys me so much listening with headphones or near field monitors.Aaron Brasket"
5,Dubtastic,"One of my favourite albums. Well, Pack of albums. When I fell in love with Dub it started with this compilation. I have hundreds of CDs spanning many styles and genres(ouch!) and this TRIPTYCH thing precociously charged its way to frequent rotation for over a solid six months after purchase. It is probably the most relaxing couple of discs I own; I can chuck it on and know that I can chill out(ouch!again) to nearly seventy minutes of Dub bliss. And that's just disc one. I was particularly drawn to purchase this because of the praise for 'Blackboard Jungle Dub', including the massive distinction of ""best dub album of all-time"" and while it is pretty Dub good, the other two are not just filler. As I've said before: it is music with a sense of humour, a twinkle in its glassy eyes and a relaxed smile on its face."
5,Quality and value,"Beautiful sweatshirt, reasonable price, on-time delivery. I bought this for my 16-yr nephew, a Boston College hopeful, and he loved it. I wasn't sure about the sizing but the small Men's was perfect."
1,Avoid this product if you enjoy reading English on your PC !,"I just bought this software from Amazon and installed it this past weekend (5/15/04). At first, everything seemed fine. Then, this morning I was cleaning up the recycle bin, which is normally pretty straightforward, right? Well, McAfee prompted me to use it's 'shredder' utility. I thought 'why not?' ... and when the machine rebooted ... I could not read a thing. It apparently changed the system language on my machine. I've never had anything this ridiculous happen before. I've asked Amazon if I can return the software, but no matter what happens ... I will NEVER buy another McAfee product again. What garbage!!! I should've listened to the other reviews here, but I guess I learned the hard way."
1,McAfee going backwards,I uninstalled it an hour after I installed it. I upgraded from 7 professional and it seems like 8 has less features.- You can't disable the splash screen like you can in 7- You can't get rid of Security Manager (basically just their marketing software) like you can in 7- You can't define directories to exclude like you can in 7I wish I could give it 0 stars.
1,This software doesn't work!,"As soon as I installed this software on my PC, the connection to my printer is blocked. I was forced into a choice: virus protection or printer. I used McAfee's tech support. I was on-line with them for the most part of the next three days (even took a day off from work). Following tech support's instructions, I un-installed it, re-installed it, un-installed it again, re-installed it again, and over and over. This software has given me more troubles than all the viruses combined. In the end, I was told by their support center located in India that my case will be escalated to a higher level since they couldn't fix the problem. They asked for my phone number and told me someone from the next level would call me. More than a month has passed, and I haven't heard from anyone at McAfee.If there was a zero-star rating, I would have given it zero. Stay away from software made by McAfee, and go buy Norton's anti-virus software."
2,A horrible resource hog.,"I can only guess it prevents viruses from accessing your system by its systematic way of filling your entire hard drive with its own data.Shees, I have 3.8GB of DAT data files sitting on my drive! Given its an older laptop with only 17 G hard drive, thats pretty horrible. Why does it not clean up after itself?So if you have Virus Scan 8 installed and are wondering where all of your disk space seems to be disappearing to, check the dat file repository:C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Network Associates\Common Framework\Current\VSCANDAT1000\DATYou might be surprised at the sheer volume of data stored there. I mean, does a virus scan program need almost 4 G of data to scan for incoming viruses?"
3,"IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT, DON'T BUY IT.","Strictly, from a student's perspective this is not a good book, even though some professors might like it. First, this book have numerous misprints, especially in exercises, so you might often find yourself trying to prove something which is false and, in this case, it is really a waste of time. Second, the 1st section of a book, develops measure theory for a real line, while the 3rd -- for general measure spaces. Now, this is a real waste, as the general theory, basically consists of the same theorems, so there is not point in proving everything twice."
3,"Okay book, not okay print","My Real Analysis class follows this book. However, when I ordered it and got it, I found out that I have a bad printout - when any previously used equations were mentioned, only (??) was in the text, some exercises were missing or numbered differently, and some paragraphs were also missing. Somehow, the book cover was the same as the 4th edition. The seller agreed to take the book back, but it was still inconvenient, and I met other people from my class who had the same problem."
5,terrific reference book,I'm surprised to see some negative reviews for this book. I've long found it to be an extremely useful reference book and probably look more stuff up in this book than any other math book I own. Anyone who works with real analysis but is not an expert on the topic would find this useful.
3,Why to write two books and bound them as one?,"This is a very curious book. It performs the construction of the same integration theory twice! I still wonder why. In the first part the author builds up the theory for the real-variable case, and in the second for the general Banach-space case. The first one is totally included in the second one, so, why to do it? Perhaps to make the book thicker and more expensive? It would be enough to point out the real-variable case as an observation and even as an excercise. None of my teachers used it as textbook and I have used it only as a reference, but not the most important of them.Other features I don't like are that some interesting results are left for the reader as excercises, and that most of its notations are not standard. But nevertheless the text itself is not so bad.Please check my other reviews in my member page (just click on my name above)."
3,"Excellent Reference, Poor Introduction","This book is an excellent reference for analysis. The proofs are modern and generally excellent, and the treatment of measure and integration is very advanced. However, I would not recommend this book as an introduction; not very much motivation or intuition is provided for the material, and the double-coverage of abstract and real cases is awkward. Recommended substitute: Walter Rudin, Real and Complex Analysis, and Kolmogorov, Introductory Real Analysis."
5,A Renewed Classic: Very Well Set,"Foolishly I originally opted for what turned out to be a paperback copy of the 3rd Edition of ""Royden"" thinking that I would be closer to the original. Well, not everybody makes the right decision right away. I have since learned that Royden passed away suddenly back in 1993. This explains why for some time no new edition of this classic book came out, not since 1988. This might also explain why the paperback 3rd Edition is so poorly typeset. Rest assured, the 4th Edition with Fitzpatrick has been marvelously typeset. Now to answer whether or not we can trust Fitzpatrick. What has he done so far? Well he has completed some incomplete proofs, and he has added some much needed material. This book is still ""Royden"". If that is what you want, then buy the book."
3,Why Royden?,"Frankly, I have never understood this book. It is essentially a mixture of big and little Rudin. It is a good book but is also terse relative to real analysis and little Rudin and even more so in terms of measure theory and big Rudin. If you are really well versed in analysis this is a good book to extend your thinking - but, I believe, the older (original - i.e. used) copies are just as good."
1,Good candidate for the worst math book ever,"This book is absolutely horrific .Royden proves (mostly handwaves) a few theorems , and then expects the student to be able to solve the exercises easily given this background.Can we even call this a Math Book?? As it is unfortunately the case with most graduate level textbooks in the U.S , the exercises are minimally related to what the author develops (or tries to develop).Books like this do not take much effort to write , while the students trying to learn this hard subject are the real victims.I agree with another reviewer that this book was written by Royden just to impress his peers.The important theorems are just given with the most minimal explanations possible ,and no effort whatsoever is made to get to the intuitive roots of the subject.Important examples are also close to nonexistent.Can anything be worse??"
4,This is a pretty average Real Analysis book,"The book presents a nice introduction to Lebesgue integration theory. There are a lot of typos so it isn't a good book to learn on your own from because his notation is not rigors. The book doesn't make a good reference either, being that a lot of the important results are left as exercises. So I would have to say this book isn't great, but I would recommend it over a lot of the other analysis books out there. I personally found that Halmos ""Measure Theory,"" was pretty good."
4,"For under 100 dollars, you can't do much better...","I bought these for an old Technics SA-80 stereo reciever and wow, I do believe that these are the best sub-100 dollar speakers I have heard. They fill up the room and have a nice full range sound. I've heard that some people aren't pleased with the low end, but I haven't had a problem with the loudness turned on. They don't sound as good at high levels with that reciever, but I plugged them into my Onkyo TX-3000 and they really shone. If you're on a budget and want something that doesn't sound puny then you can't go wrong with these."
3,Unhappy with amazon procedure,"I am concerned about ordering online with Amazon. I was shopping for speakers for a Christmas present. I was interested in these speakers, but I decided that they were not what I wanted. I was going through the checkout procedure and canceled my transaction...or so I thought! I never actually finished the checkout...but to my surprise, I received an e-mail the following day that the speakers had been shipped already. The main reason I decided AGAINST the speakers was that the shipping cost was almost as much as the speakers. That is the reason I did not return the unwanted speakers. Just because I had purchased something previously from Amazon, they were able to take the information from my credit card and continue with the speaker purchase that I thought I had cancelled.I doubt that I will purchase from Amazon again.Leslie C. Brown"
5,AWESOME SPEAKERS!!!,"These speakers are top notch!!! After blowing out our Klipsch Bookshelf Speakers, we purchased these as a replacement (not wanting to spend $1000 on Klipsch). Honestly, I can say that these speakers are sooooooo much better than the Klipsch; the sound is CRISP! We have them hooked up to our 100 watt Yamaha receiver (newer) and let me tell you, when listening to a live cd, it's as if you are actually at the show! I'm not sure I would call these ""bookshelf"" speakers, as they are bit larger than what you would expect. We are a Denon, Klipsch, Yamaha house, and we do recommend these! Good job Sony!"
3,A good speaker for the money.,"These are a good speaker for the money. Recently, I also purchased a pair of Polk R15 speakers to put in my bedroom. The Polks cost about the same as the Sony's but are much smaller. To be honest, I like the sound quality of the Polk's much better. I guess if you need a bigger speaker to fill a huge room, the Sony's would be adequate, but overall, I highly recommend getting the Polks. One final advantage: you can easily mount the Polks on the wall."
5,Not just best for the money.,"I am driving these with a vintage Kenwood 40wpc amp. I don't think you can get speakers, that will fit on a bookshelf, any better than these. They are as good as (maybe better?) my custom built, 3rd order crossover, speakers. If you compare them side by side with the high end speakers, and want accurate reproduction, with low distortion, these will not only save you money, but will give you a better system. You don't need a boom-box (subwoofer) with these. Very neutral and natural sound. Not much for snob appeal, but who needs it."
5,Awesome,Extremely pleased - these speakers sound great! I had high expectations given other reviews but I was nonetheless blown away. A great price as well.
3,First Hour is Five Stars,"This program reairs on A & E from time to time. I watched it with my first grade daughter after we did a unit on ancient Egypt. The first hour was excellent. It incorporated reenactments to simluate the race between the French and British efforts to decode the stone.The second hour, however, paints Christians in a stereotypical negative way as being against all educational efforts. It was way over the top and showed a complete lack of understanding for the historical complexities and nuances of the period. For this reason, I rated the video overall as being 3 stars. I do hope they will release it as a DVD."
3,"Book was ok, but not as good as Halftime","There are a few things that I learned from reading this book. I have recently retired (knowing I must continue working) so the book was a timely read. However, the information did not resonant with me. On the other hand, I found Halftime to be inspiring, as well as, informative."
2,Bible-banging agenda distracts from great message,"It's clear the author is very insightful, and has clearly done some deep thinking about how to make every day of your life significant. Unfortunately, although he says his insights apply to people of most religions, I found as a non-Christian that his constant Bible-banging and Christian-laced quotes and advice were just too distracting for me. Couldn't get through it because I found it so offensive, which I found to be a shame, because it was so distracting from what is such an important topic."
5,The Diva's are back!,"SNP put out this slammin hits cd! Brings back great memories and according to their website, you can look for their return in 2000 with SNP2K a brand new cd from the DIVA's."
5,An invaluable guide,YOU CAN BE A COLUMNIST is an extremely helpful guide for anyone entering this field. As a travel writer & columnist myself I tend to examine books both for their practical information and for the quality of the writing. This book is excellent on both counts. Anyone contemplating becoming a columnist MUST buy this book.
4,Good earpiece,"My main reason for purchasing this was so my hunting partner and I can communicate while on the hunt. While waiting for the season to start, I decided to use it while coaching golf (to talk to the head coach in different locations of the golf course). It works great.I probably should have opted for the inline microphone, but it's not too much of a bother to pick up the unit and speak into the mic."
5,BUY IT NOW..!,"A cracking rhythm section provides a hypnotic backdrop to Busi Mhlongo's incredible voice. She sings with a powerful style of the stuff that matter in this life. I can recommend her other work, but this is the best and most accessible I've come across. If you like solidly sung african music, you will love this."
4,An Under-rated GIft,"Busi Mhlongo's voice is AMAZING. definitely among the top 10 singers i've ever ever heard. anyone interested in beautiful eclectic music should have this CD. i've had it for a couple years now and still get chills when i hear her voice. she's one of the most under-rated south african singers today. the songs are catchy, beautiful, easy to dance to, and downright thought-provoking. you don't even have to understand the language she speaks to understand the passion of her art."
2,Not as accurate as I had hoped,"Pros: Big numbers that are easy to read. Large foot locations.Cons:Questionable accuracy.For the price of this scale, I would have hoped it to have been more accurate. I thought it strange that I had suddenly gained 4 to 5 pounds so I did a side by side comparison with a calibrated double beam balance scale. The Taylor 935 put me at 170. The double beam balance at 167. I've contaced Taylor to see if I can adjust it.Large footprint.The oversize display and foot pads don't come without a price. The overall size of this scale takes up a lot of room. Smaller bathrooms may be hard pressed to find a suitable location."
2,A disappointment after 1 year of use,"We've lived with this scale for about a year (see my earlier review). I am now dissatisfied. Here are the major problems:1. Poor accuracy. It seems to read low consistently, and my measured weight is inconsistent. It can jump up or down by 4-5 pounds in successive readings (done within a few minutes). I am careful to stand on it the same way each time, but to no avail. My wife has had similar experiences lately. There doesn't seem to be any way to adjust it.2. Sensitivity. You must stand very still. If not, it grinds for a while, then displays ERR. Then you have to get off and try again. I've given up on weighing myself first thing in the morning, because I'm not steady enough until I've been up for a while. This is very irritating.I would not recommend purchase."
1,Taylor Lithium 0935 Professional Digital Platform Scale,"This particular scale is too sensitive.You will burn calories just trying to get it to work.The ""ERR"" display will come up if you just breathe funny.I recommend you stick with a dial model."
5,a great collection,"Excellent piano version of great tunes. I knew Owen was a great surgeon, but never dreamed what a talented pianist he is."
3,Great track pity about the title,"Goodnight Nelda Grebe The Telephone Company Has Cut Us Off... a joke? Possibly, but this is one of the best R&B tracks I own with a stunning electronic sax break and breathtaking singing from Tracy Nelson. Worth getting the album for this track alone."
3,"MERCURY: Re-release ""LIVING WITH THE ANIMALS""","I own this CD and I like it. I like it because it has several cuts from the classic '68 LP by Mother Earth, ""Living With the Animals."" With CDs clocking in a 79 minutes, couldn'd we have had the whole album and not just teasting snippets? Man, I still remember vividly the opening riffs to ""Living With the Animals."" This CD has some good stuff from that album on it, but that albmum is like Abbey Road. You don't pick and choose. You judge it in its entirety. It was a great, great, great album and I sure hope that some day Mercury, Rhino, Sundazed or somebody will put it out on CD. If so, I promise to buy five copies!!!!"
5,Philosophical (must read!),Go in the mind of a leader and on what this wise man was thinking about as he fought the enemies. Highly intensive and interesting.
4,Pretty sweet!,"I am a major wimp when it comes to horror movies, so this movie totally freaked me out! I really liked the plot though. This movie is the first of a set of three that M. Night Shyamalan is writing and producing called the Night Chronicles. They are all supposed to have something supernatural in them, which sounds really exciting. I was a little surprised at the kind of pro-Christian messages in this movie, especially coming from Shyamalan. First, starting out with the Bible verse at the beginning, then throughout the movie, and finally the end quote: ""If the devil is real, then God must be real too.""I would hope that people would take this movie and think about it a little bit deeper than just a scary movie."
2,Not so good,I wanted a movie that would be really scary but this just wasnt it. Nightmare on elmstreet and the howling moves 1-4 were much better.
1,Too bad even for ironic appeal,"I sincerely enjoy terrible horror movies. They are my form of high art. I cook a nice dinner and crack wise the whole time, and the result is usually funnier than most comedies. When I saw a preview for this film I tried to explain it to a friend: ""M-Night. 5 people in an elevator, and one of them... is the devil."" Sounded like it was right up my alley. The beginning is just fine, by which I mean terrible, but the rising action and anticlimax are simply awful. It seems like M-Night predicted I would be watching this movie, so instead of tying together the pieces (of something smelling like the devil), the writer/producer/whatever decided to deny me what I so richly deserved-- and the result is pretentious loose ends without a hope for any kind of enjoyment. No wonder I fell asleep the first time, then forgot I ever watched this flick in the first place."
2,"Claustrophobic, sterotypical characters, slow paced.","Very disappointing M. Night production, he started off with a bang and seems to be going out with a whimper. The actors did their best with the pedestrian dialogue. But, when he had such a interesting/unpredictable character like the devil to play with, the possibilities can be limitless not dull. The devil should never be dull."
2,M. Night Shymalan...ugh.,I stayed far away during its theatrical run because M. Night Shyamalan's name was attached. And the last good movie he made was Unbreakable ten years ago. I decided to give it a rent anyway and it wasn't even worth the $3 I spent. The twist wasn't even a shock because I wasn't invested in the characters or the story. I was just bored. I'm glad it was only a little over an hour long (hour and fifteen minutes to be exact).
2,slow and stupid,Basically a bunch of freaks in an elevator and they start to die. End of story and be sure you drink some coffee to stay awake.
3,Watch Blackout instead,"The producers of Devil pretty much took the idea from the 2007 movie ""Blackout"". I think that Blackout was better than Devil. Not saying Devil was dumb but Blackout is better."
2,Pg 13!!!??,WTF is this movie pg13!? Could have went with the flow like the rest of the supposed scary movies and made a rated R movie instead (This movie wasn't scary at all). Glad I watched it on PPV and used a certificate so I didnt waste any money on it. On another note it got to the point right away at least. Not sure whats with the pg and pg13 movies lately...
4,nice,"I don't care if the characters were very developed, or if the crops didn't come in this year, or any other BS most people complain about in reviews. The intelligence of mankind is proven on a daily basis on public forums such as these. The movie is exciting, scary enough, and keeps you guessing. That was the point of it. It's not meant to be freaking Catcher in the Rye. Really cool movie that wouldn't let me leave the room the rest of the night."
3,Decent,"I think M. Night should stick to writing movies, and let someone else direct them. This was much better than his last movie, and the concept is good. Easily figured out, and there is lots of foreshadowing...lots. Some questionable moments throughout, but a decent horror movie."
5,GREAT MOVIE!,Well written and VERY SCARY! I watched this movie at night and it was awesome. Kept me looking over my shoulder the whole time. Good plot and very unique too! Has an ending you won't expect!
3,Devil - Or not...,"I wanted to see this when it was in the theaters but it wasn't there long. Love M Knight...but this was not one of his best. It was quite a stretch for me to buy into it and it didn't include the usual ""slightly humorous"" installation of his other movies. It's worth watching a couple of times and I will still go see his other movies. This just had a ""Can't afford to get out of the elevator in this movie"" element to it."
4,Damn..I really wanted you!,I liked this movie. It had just enough of everything I enjoy in a movie minus the blood and nudity. I didn't think a PG movie would come off this well.
3,"Slight M Knight, going up.","M. Knight Shyamalan makes a slight return to his game in the claustrophobic suspense film, ""Devil."" It's not really a horror film as much a tightly wound whodunnit, with five people trapped in an elevator being killed off one by one, as two cops and two building supervisors watch from outside. The film plays it minimally, with the scares coming from surprise and not from gore.That's to ""Devil's"" benefit. In fact, the opening credits alone are enough to disorient you, as a fast moving something zeroes in on Philadelphia and the building are soon to be devil-meeters, almost all of them only slightly known actors.Shyamalan wrote the script as part of a ""Night Chronicles"" series, with brothers John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle directing, which is also to the film's benefit. Trimmed down to a fast 90 minutes, no time or space is wasted (even if the ending becomes predictable as it approaches). It makes the potential for more of the chronicles promising."
4,Damn Good Movie,"I came in with no prior knowledge and expectations about the film, but when it ended I had the following thoughts:1. It was a well written film.2. Even though it takes place in a elevator it manages somehow to accomplish its goals.a. Exciting psychological thriller.b. unexpected ending."
3,interesting,at the beginning the movie is a little scary but then you find out that it turns out to be supernatural. but it has some scenes that are puzzling.
4,DEVIL ON BOARD,"I liked this movie. It has an interesting plot; a competent cast; creepy atmosphere; and a M. Night twist ending. My only disappointment is its final scene, but I understand the writer's intent.It's far better than Night's other disasters--SIXTH SENSE excluded. Spook fans should enjoy."
4,See it,"I'am a horror/suspense movie snob. I will watch 10 minutes of a movie, roll my eyes and turn it off. I didn't roll my eyes with the Devil. To keep it short and sweet, I felt it was scary, suspensful, and all around a great movie, I wish I had seen it in the theatres. I don't think you will be sorry if you buy/rent this film."
3,If you like to find meaning in Nights work ..this may be too simple,"I am a Night S. fan...the sort tho' that loved Signs and Lady in the water and Unbreakable. I love finding the undercurrent of meaning and moral in a story. Unfortunately this one spoon feeds it and at the end uses cheap supernatural cgi crap to convey it.I liked it, entertaining enough if you like ""clean horror, w/ a moral"" just not very deep and not shot very interesting in my opinion.If you like intense horror and gore you will not like this at all, it will play out like a cheap moral story.I do hope Night does more work on the level of Signs and Lady but that is just my two cents."
3,Interesting,"Suspenseful movie, but it starts out a bit ridiculous. The narrator starts by saying his mother used to tell him a story about the devil coming to earth to torture lost souls and it starts with a suicide. What kind of demented mother would tell her son this kind of story? Sometimes M. Night jumps right past logic. But otherwise, this movie is worth viewing and does keep you guessing until the end."
2,Devil Flops!,I saw this at The Cinema and expected it to be lots better..I sort of figured out who was the devil before the end..but the story really had no substance to it and was boring...
5,Elevator Creeps,It's hard to believe that this entire movie took place in an elevator and a security booth. The ending was very refreshingly surprising in this time of obvious movie outcomes.
3,Very engaging horror,"M. Night Shyamalan takes a break from direction and writes this story about five people in an elevator one of which happens to be the devil. Comprising entirely of fresh faces, there are many hooks in this story to keep us engrossed. The characters were believable and the drama is mostly about these people in an elevator, which is stuck between floors. The storm clouds gathering over Philadelphia added to the creepy atmosphere. Three stars. 1/27/11"
4,Edge of the seat suspense,"Good one, the first of The Night Chronicles, suspenseful and scary but also gets you thinking; good story by Shyamalan but he turns the directing over to John Erick Dowdle, who does a very stylish job with a good assist by cinematographer Tak Fujimoto who is brilliant. Breakout role for Chris Messina who finally gets to play a strong hero part (he usually gets cast as a jerk) as the shrewd and efficient detective who is battling his own demons."
3,Just average,"A group of strangers are together on an elevator located in a high-rise building, when the elevator suddenly stops, and strange occurrences begin. An intriguing storyline that provides some thrills, but does not seem to quite live up to its promise. All of the players involved are unlikeable and there is little mystery as to what is occurring. There are some positive aspects to the film because as the lights go out, the audience anticipates what will happen next, but it all ends in an unremarkable conclusion. The film contains some good scares, and is a movie that is unremarkable but does contain some redeeming qualities."
4,3.5 stars,3.5 stars. is it super scary? is it the scariest movie ever?it did its job of entertaining me. enough said!
1,The movie sucked!,I was hoping this would bring M. Night back but it was once again a failure! The ending was ok. This movie did not thrill or scare me in the least. I was reallyhoping for more as the previews looked good. Once again the few scenes that weren't bad are in the previews so it is not worth renting!
1,Where is the zero stars button?,"This was so God-awful that I can't imagine anyone favorably reviewing it. Ever. Probably the worst film M. Night has made so far, besides The Happening. Why does he make such crappy movies? Won't someone stop him?I'm not going into any kind of detail for why this sucks because I'd be here all day. Sorry, don't have that kind of time. I love great movies and this is the antithesis of those.Awake!Venger As'Nas SatanisIpsissimusCult of Cthulhu"
1,I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS MOVIE,"EVERYTHING HAPPEN IN THE ELEVATOR , WHEN WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN SOMETHING INTERESTING THE LIGHTS WILL TURN OFF AND THERE WAS A DEATH PERSON, I WASTED MY MONEY"
3,"Rent, don't own.","There's a reason why you probably didn't see this in theaters. Not one of Night's best...not even close...not terrible, but not very good."
5,one of my favorite movies,you wouldnt think 5 people trapped in an elevator would be a good movie but this is awesome! good story line and a great cast including jenny o'hara ---(doug heffernans mom)
2,Better than expected (for an M. Night film),"The main problem with this film is the title. Instead of being genuinely surprised by the turn of events in the film, you'll probably spend most of your time waiting for the title character to show up.If you don't watch horror movies, are scared of the dark, have never seen a Hitchcock film, or are claustrophobic, you might find Devil to be somewhat scary. Otherwise, you will probably be bored with the numerous ""lights go out and something strange happens"" scenes.The acting in Devil is good and the cinematography is great, but with the help of the narrator/security guard, the story quickly becomes laughable. Devil could have easily been a single, standalone episode on a show about the paranormal like Fringe or the X-Files, but as a full-length feature film, it lacks any real substance.Don't expect Devil to be a horror film, have a good story, or be in any way believable, and you might like it. Keep your expectations low before watching."
2,Don't have high expectations,"With the title of this book, I was under the wrong impression that I could find a rich source of information, however, this book can be described to be sketchy at best with it' details. Though the author provides some details( which are like drops in a ocean), I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,A hopeless waste of money,"This book wallows on a lot of stuff, but stops short of giving detailed info on any particular subject. Spend ur money somewhere else!"
1,Stay away !!!!,"I bought this unit as a Christmas present and have had many problems. The unit loses connection with the remote sensor even at short distances (i.e. 6 inches). I have tried different locations (moving the units away from RF interference), Lithium Ion batteries for the remote sensor ($8.00 for two AAA batteries) with no success. I have sent a couple of emails to Oregon Scientific and have only received automated responses saying that I will be contacted within 48 hours. Well, I am still waiting.If you buy this, I hope you have better luck than me."
3,nice ornament,We did a lime green X mas tree. This ornament had some red in it as well. It was not lime green as pictured but was still cool and we liked it.
5,Picotto = Piu,"Mauro Picotto IS Mario Piu.... It's just another name he produces under. For example, Armin van Buuren = Rising Star and Perpetuous Dreamer, Matt Darey = Lost Tribe, Ferry Corsten = Gouryella, etc. NEWBIES!! SHEeeSH! ;-) HEHE... The reasons DJ's produce under several different monikers are many, but one main reason is because the moment you produce under a different name, also means contract obligations with certain record companies don't always have the same jurisdiction.And to that guy that dissed Picotto, why don't you take your broke az5 and go beg for some krack money to buy a clue with..."
5,help in meeting your spirit guides,I really enjoyed listening to this cd tape alotit is really a nice cd tape to listen to I was very happy with it
1,scooby doo costume review,the costume is paper thin...with a hole in the seam of the left shoulder. the costume is not worth the money to send back to replace
3,Just okay...,"As far as costumes go, it's cute, but it's definitely cheap. After I purchased this online, I found the same exactly one at Halloween USA for $6 cheaper. It's nothing special. My 3-yr. old wears size 3T and the costume runs a little small on him. For one time use, it's fine. But, if you want a killer costume that will last forever, this is not the one."
3,Doesn't answer THE question of BanjoKazooie,"I bought and read the book and played the game to free Tootie, but THE question that BanjoKazooie leaves every player with- is this- at the conclusion of the game - Mumbo Jumbo shows pictures of ""secret ""areas of the game! You know ""Where""- but not ""How"" to access these areas, and because Kazooie that smart aleck bird insulted Mumbo, he says he's not telling- so- you're left with this HUGE mystery- to solve. How do you acess the secret areas that mumbo caused you to collect every last jiggy in the game, to know about- YET, THEN he refuses to disclose the ""HOW. If anyone finds out how, PLEASE E-Mail to Rsears8378@aol.com"
2,A mediocre guide for a great game.,"The description at the beggining is very informative, but that's where everything goes down. They randomly place the location of Notes, Jiggys and Jinjos below pictures describing where is it. But they put it unorganized.Next time, i'll test-read a guide before i buy it."
1,Not worth it.,"We used to have a Banjo Kazooie guide book, and it got lost. So we ordered a new one thinking it would be the same. WRONG! It is undetailed, vague, and horrible drawn. It says this is here and this is here, but gives no advice on how to get to the object and tips to help. I regret buying this will and will now have to hunt around for another one that is worth the money."
1,This guide SUCKS,"This guide does have a lot of maps, but most of them are confusing as heck! The maps show smaller maps that aren't even marked or in the correct location for you to find them! The front cover says it shows you where to find everything, when it doesn't! It's a complete LIE. If you are missing some musical notes or something important, you don't even know where to Begin looking. It's vague and unclear about what to do in a level first, or second, etc. I thought this guide would help, but it's so dang confusing, you're better off just ""winging it""!"
2,AVG.,"This book was somewhat helpful in getting through B-K in a reasonable amount of time, but it was definitely not as helpful or detailed as Prima's guide for Zelda. I used free B-K info I found on the web more than the book for tips on finding items."
3,A SO-SO STRATEGY GUIDE...,"I know this is an old guide for an old game but man,does it show!! i had a hard time following along with the walkthrough. and thats pretty bad considering this is a pretty simple. i got it because im addicted to buying strategy guides. helps me get absorbed into the game. this guide did little for that purpose. wasnt horrible but wasnt great."
4,"To play you don't need it, but it's a nice luxury","my brothers and i bought the game, banjo-kazooie. We worked through the game without having to refer to the book but once or twice.(it was a lot of hard work) so if you want to play B-K the easy way, buy the book! It makes everything a whole lot easier and has very nice illustrations and instructions and It tells every thing except the secrets at the very end. But I recently found out those secrets are in the sequel being made, Banjo-Tooie. So don't buy it if that's what you're trying to find out."
1,Worthless for Professionals,"I found this book absolutely worthless for anyone pursuing a professional career. 50% or more of the questions it helps you answer are questions that I have never heard asked in an interview and it would be the waste of an interviewers time to ask them. I have interviewed people for my past employers before and I would never dream of asking most of these questions, so why would you waste your time preparing for them? What's worse, the questions that I hear most frequently when being interviewed don't seem to be mentioned in this book."
3,Good Guide,Read the whole book. I would say it's definitely not geared for the lower lever people. Seems like it was for high level management. It is a good book though. I'm government so not everything pertained and I'm not high level.
4,Freestyle a New Style?,Love the cd Like Ashleys Song Over & Over and Dfrnt Stylz. Is there any new product available from your label .
5,"You, Too, Can Be Prosperous","This book was copyrighted in 1950. I was cleaning out my book shelf and discovered it. Since it was so old I figured it would be old stuff. But, rather than put it in the ""Good Will"" pile, I decided to read it again.I couldn't put it down. I am now ready to ""understand"" the message the author is sending. This is powerful stuff he is giving us. I recommend this book to everyone. Thank you Robert Russell!"
4,Leather Daddy and the Femme,"I had read part of this book while visiting a very hot lady friend, so I knew what I was getting into. Very edgy and out there sexually for me. The book really caught my attention during my visit so I wanjted a copy of my own. Passion, unbridled lust, and love in all its forms. Great visual scenes, hot, dangerous, exciting sexual encounters. This would not be my scene, but it does give one food for thought on all matters sexual and the different forms passion, sexuality and love do take. A fun romp!"
3,a warning that must be heeded,"This is a subject of such magnitude that one must learn as` much as possible in order to avert another turn in this direction. Six volumes give this some degree of weight. The size of this world of unreality must be given a great deal of reflection because one version can never fill in all the details.What I""m saying is don't let this be the final word; dig more deeply. The subject is vast."
3,And if you like Soft Machine...,"When you must have it all, get this one. My only quibble, is that is sounds a bit thin, i.e. like an ok quality audience tape. Again, the Soft Machine material coming out on Voice Print just doesn't sound as good at the stuff out on Cuneiform. That said, I can't recommend this one to people new to the Softs. For you, start with the first four studio recordings, the BBC stuff that is out now, etc. Another interesting bit on this one is that Robert Wyatt doesn't really sing on this one. The playing, over all though, is first rate."
3,Thick and Sludgey,"This one offers some great playing... only problem is you better love Mike Ratledge's organ first. It's the most audible instrument on the recording. Elton is pretty audible too. Poor Wyatt gets thrown into the back as usual. His drums just cant cut thru the front end. Overall though, this is a nice document of a band at it's peak in my opinion. There is some excellent playing though and worthy of picking up if you are a completionist and Softs fan."
2,Not so classic!,"Volume 2 is unfortunately not a worthy follow-up to Miami Dance Classics Volume 1. The strength of the first volume was that it contained a large number of Miami freestyle tracks that were national dance hits as well as other little-known gems. This volume focuses too much on singles that weren't well-known outside of the Miami scene. Only three could really be called hits: Trinere's ""I'll Be All You Ever Need"", Debbie Deb's ""Lookout Weekend"" and Company B's ""Fascinated"" (not to quibble too much, but how did Quality Control overlook the misspelling of the CD's subtitle as ""Facinated""?). Unfortunately, no hidden gems emerge from the other filler tracks, songs that weren't hits and lesser follow-ups from artists who'd previously had national chart success. Stick with the first volume and skip this one."
2,"Lots of fun, but not durable!","My 4-year-old son got this as a gift 3 months ago. We purchased it at Target because it is supposed to be for children up to 70 pounds (my son is 50 lbs., so we thought it would last for quite some time). He has loved riding it around the neighborhood, but recently the fork has begun to crack and the rings that hold the front tire in fall out, rendering the cycle both unsafe and unusable. We will have to find something more durable, probably made out of steel. BTW, Target no longer has it on their website!"
4,"Informative and interesting, but","I really enjoyed the backstage peek at the UConn Huskies. This is the kind of book I want when I'm trying to figure out what makes a team tick or what goes into making a team successful. BUT...this book really needed an editor/proofreader. It is riddled with spelling errors and odd sentence structure, and there are a couple of facts that get garbled. (At one point, the Lady Volunteers travel to Texas, apparently to play against themselves.) This does get in the way of full enjoyment and engagement."
5,this is a great book that every basketball fan should read!,"Ok, first I have to admit, I'm a huge fan of UCONN basketball, Diana Taurasi in particular, but that doesn't make me biased:). I think this book is well written, fun to read, funny, and insightful. It tels the story of an amazing basketball team that deserves recognition even though they didn't reach their final goal. I learned a lot from this book, and it made me laugh and cry. I think that anyone who has interest in women's basketball will enjoy this book, especially if you are a fan of the UCONN huskies. Go huskies!:)"
5,"Great book of ""greatest"" team","After winning the 2004 NCAA Championship, UConn senior Maria Conlon said, ""I feel like it was just yesterday we were lying in the locker room in St. Louis crying our eyes out, saying we never wanted to have this feeling again. Sure enough, we never did.""Perhaps the true greatness of the 00-01 Huskies can only now be appreciated. Could Taurasi & Co hunger for excellence without first knowing the bitterness of falling just short? This book can add fuel to the argument."
2,Air Good! Baricco Bad!,"Well, Air have done it again. They've created another moody, catchy, wonderful album of material that I find thoroughly enjoyable. Unfortunately, I can barely hear it because of the droning Italian voice that covers nearly every note. While this was an intriguing idea, I really wish I could do one of the following: a) listen to the music without the words or b) listen to the words in a language I can speak. Because as unsophisticated or perhaps even bigoted as it sounds, I have no interest in listening to Italian for an hour straight. It just gets annoying.In conclusion, go back to Air's older material (except Everybody Hertz) and enjoy it immensely. Leave this one alone.From a huge Air fan~"
3,Air are certainly Amazing,"Air's new release caught my attention, besides the fact that it is AIR, because it's the wierdest idea for an album, ever. They provide music while an author reads his novel in his native Italian, and produced by Nigel Godrich of Radiohead? Hmm....The fact is, the album is the least possibly accessible in the history of god. It is great music, but only for a true Air Fan. I bought it and it has a nice spot in my collection, as I can boast I have all the Air albums, minus the forgettable Everybodyt Hertz. If you want Air, I recommend 10,000 ghz, Moon safari, premier symptomes, or virgin suicides.The music is good, and I hear if you read along to the ""lyrics"", it makes sense. However, I am a bit iffy on reading the english to the Italian, which is gibberish to my unknowledgeable-about-Italian brain. Personally, I find this great to write papers to, or read books (in English, for me).I hear Air is coming out with a ""Real"" cd by the end of this year....that I will wait for!!"
2,"I'd like either the Air album, or the audio book. Not both.","I speak Italian, and despite Air and Baricco might say about their collaborating, the music doesn't work incredibly well with Baricco's spoken word. The music is minimal to say the least, but in my opinion, would have been nice to soak in alone. The problem is, it's as effective in helping the text like reading a book in a hotel lobby; while at times it may fit the text, there is hardly any dramatical effect that corresponds with Baricco's voice. I'm sure this is likely to fly over the heads of most of us. I listened to this record prior to leaving for Italy with minimal listen comprehension, thinking about how much Baricco's voice tends to drown out the music in a tug of war for our attention. A year later after several months in Italy, the music and Baricco's voice take turns sounding out of place.Read the book, listen to Air, but the two things don't work out to well. Nice try anyway."
5,Huge Def Leppard fan,I am a huge Def Leppard fan since they came out and I thought I knew everything about them until I got this book. It gives you alot of inside information about their early days and the struggles with their record company and the support that they were not getting from them. It also goes into the time frame when the UK fans turned against them thinking they were selling out to get to America. They knew what they wanted and weren't going to let anything or anyone stand in thier way. Great book and you won't be disappointed.
5,Much needed ... compass on cover is very appropriate,"Excellent ... every leader, and I mean every pastor, evangelist etc. should read and work htrough this book. Anointed ! What God is after with church then and now... Would HIGHLY recommend this book ! Robert Hayana (Author)"
1,Expected a comic book,"It is not a comic book, it is a full length novel. So be aware of that if you purchase."
3,Super Reader,"Johnny Alpha and several other Strontium Dogs are ambushed and trapped into working for a very bad man, thanks to the old micro-explosive-implant device. This includes Durham Red.They have to kill a robot for him, but the catch is that the robot is on a planet that is sped up in time.This 'Team X' is forced to work together, but everyone is not as they seem, and a high-level betrayal and complicated relationship surface at the end.Good thing Johnny understands time bombs better than anyone else."
2,Cards Blurry,"I wasn't sure what to expect with the cards. The transaction was fast and the seller very professional, but the cards were blurry as if they had been copied over.If you're a big Steve-O fan, you will like them. Otherwise I would pass."
1,Distorted view of Evangelical Christianity,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this ""documentary"" was created with an objective purpose. The makers of this film are not sympathetic to evangelical Christianity. They portray some evangelical Christians in a way that causes you to draw negative conclusions about all evangelical Christians - that they are people that are anxious to see much of the world that doesn't believe like they do killed.This film reminds me of how 1930's films were produced in Germany to turn average German citizens against Jews.Contrary to what the film wants you to believe, the subject of this film is NOT the great obsession of followers of Jesus. Jesus said ""you will know them by their love"". There are far more evangelical Christians obsessed with, and compelled by love and how to help people, than there are planning and scheming how we can carry a sword to destroy the rest of the world. Very distorted portrayal of evangelical Christianity."
1,Disappointed,"I felt this presentation was just another liberal view of the biblical end-times put out to depict Bible believing Christians as nut-cases. It will offer many scenes of Christians at the Temple Mount and other venues teaching Biblical doctrine but shows them as mere dogmatic, blood thristy, war-mongers. They will then rationalize their own non-biblical view points of political correctness to appease their own secular humanism. All I can say is pray, read, and study the Word of God for yourselves and either accept it all by faith or do not accept it. I prefer to accept the Word of God, which includes prophecies that have been fulfilled and have not missed the mark. You cannot say this of Nostradamus or Cayce. This dvd was a waste of money."
3,"""I Will""","Holly Palmer sings a song titled ""I Will"" on the soundtrack for the motion picture ""Into The Blue"", however, there is NO SOUNDTRACK AVAILABLE FOR INTO THE BLUE!!!!! (GRRRR) .. If ANYONE knows how to find this song, email me at gotalotaluv@aol.com. Thanks!"
3,Maker is cutting corners,I find that this new batch is weaker in Menthol and Eucalyptus than the bulk order I had received several years ago. As I try one of the earlier ones it is stronger and the menthol vapor lasts to the very end. Not so with the new chips. It seems the company is cutting corners with a weaker product.
1,Menthol chips,I was very pleased with this product and will definately purchase it gain. These little chips stop caughs right away
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for small hard candies that I could suck on to relieve a sore throat. What I got were more 'gummy', they get stuck to my teeth and can be chewed up easily- they don't last long. Not as flavorful and I was hoping either, and rather expensive. Needless to say, I am disappointed and would not recommend this product."
5,Renee,"Excellent creation of Dr Hill, though a little confusing at times, he is still the Dr Hill we all know and love."
3,Not clarity driven,"I am a fan of Hulme's (The Nun's Story, The Wild Place), but I felt this book was a muddled account of her spiritual journey. I heartily recommend the factual The Wild Place (her five years helping resettle Europe's millions of displaced persons after WWII)or the Nun's Story (a good nun who left her order and I suspect based on Hulme's relationship with a nun Hulme met in The Wild Place). But this is one book where I skipped here and there, hoping for some clue as to why she wrote it. Hulme evidently found her spiritual place in the universe, but she couldn't take me with her."
5,A Great Buy!!!,"I've been waiting for this game for a long time and now it's finally out! The quests are harder and more challenging. There are also some new buildings like an Embassy, Hall of Champions, Magic Bazaar, Mausoleum, Outpost, and Sorcerer's Adobe!! There are also new monsters like Goblin Overlords, Greater Gorgons, Ice Dragons, more Ratkind, Shadow Beats, Yeti, and more!! There are now 6 new Sovereign Spells!! Also, there are many modifications to the orginal Majesty. This game is a great buy and should be bought right now!!"
2,Quests are just too hard,"I got quite good at the original Majesty but the quests in the Northern Expansion are just too hard. There's not enough variety in the game to make it interesting when you try and achieve the same quest for the tenth time, and there are too many random factors to make it much more than a gamble whether you win or lose. If I was willing to play a quest fifty times then I would probably get one where all the breaks went in my favour, but what's the point?"
1,bad game,"i hated this game, i strongly recommend people to not to spend $30.00 on this bad game. don't buy it. Sorry,Anonymous"
1,thisbooksucks,"I hated this book. The writing was bad and the plot was boring. I loved Ella Enchanted so I wonder what went wrong in this. I am disappointed in Margaret Peterson Haddix, her books are usually better than this (even if there not very good)!"
2,It was ok,I was under the impression that Just Ella would be the sequal to Ella Enchanted. I found out I was wrong. I liked Ella Enchanted much better.
3,You'll Love This.,"I read Just Ella from Margaret Peterson Haddix.It was about a girl named Ella. She was a servent for her mean step-mother. The family is invited to the princess ball but Ella has to stay home and clean the celler. Secretly she goes to the ball and is picked by the prince. After a week she hates the castle life. Read the book to find out what she does and how she got to the ball.I didn't think the book was to bad. I realy don't care for the cinderella story but I love all the books from Haddix. They're easy to read and very interesting. She made the Cinderella story very interesting with her own twists.If you like this book you should try reading the other books from Margaret Peterson Haddix. Try reading Take Off's and Landings, Amoung the Hidden, Amoung the Imposters, and Turnabout."
1,I Hated it~!,"AH!!! I completely disliked this book. I know itz not a squel to Ella Enchanted but it doesn't even follow the story line. Or the Cinderella story line for the matter. The characters are boring and rather dull. The only character worth the story line was Quog, who gave you something to raise an eyebrow. The plot was flat. The end, almost predictable. So Jed, the tutor walks into the rooms and gasped at Ella's beauty, he;s the only one who actually talks to her and likes her (other then Mary) and he spends every day with her....hum...my first impression isn't...jee, she must hate his guts. The end is predicatable, Ella give you hints Charm is slow and nastily mean, even though you don't execpt Ella to be locks away in the dungeon....you can see it coming.I thought the book was lame. 6 words. Thats enought. If you want a good Cinderella story read Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister or Ella Enchanted or a Chinesse Cinderella or something....this book is a WASTE OF TIME!!~!!!!! bye"
5,Love the Twists,"I most defenitely give this book a 5 star rating. It's very youth friendly. I ususally like more adult oriented reads but I will admit, I really enjoyed this book. It was a one eighty when it comes to a re-telling of a fairy tale. For starters, Cinderella was just Ella or CindersElla...a fairy godmother does not exist, the prince is not so charming (although Ella's tutor is ;-), etc. Ella makes her own fate come about when she works her way into the ball. The prince does pick her to become his wife and she does move into the castle to prepare for marrying the prince but she quickly comes to realize that she does not love the prince. A series of events occur when Ella trys to escape and I'll leave the rest for the readers enjoyment. I can't believe it took me this long to discover this book. I wish I had a longer review but the book itself was not a large book and was a very quick read. I will defenitely be looking into a few more books by Margaret Peterson Haddix."
2,Disappointing,"I read ""Ella Enchanted,"" by Gail Carson Levine and I absolutely loved it. Someone told me that this was s equel to it, so I bought it-only it isn't a sequel at all. IN ""Ella Enchanted"" Ella is a wonderful character will a determination to break a spell that was cast upon her when she was born. But in ""Just ella"" this Ella is snobby, almost. You can't really relate to her. I mean, she's the princess and hates it. And Prince Charming-my goodness. In ""Ella Enchanted"" I fell in love with Prince Char-he was so wonderful. But in this story Prince Charming has no brains, and doesn't care about anyone. He just liked ella because she was beautiful. So....obviously, if you want a good read pick up ""Ella Enchanted"" instead of this story."
5,Entertaining yet Deep,"Of course, it was very funny and imaginative but i also found that I had to stop and think because once you got past the funny parts, you really had to imagine how it affected Ella and did the ending suit her? I really liked it because those are the kind of books I like!"
3,Happily Ever After?,"I have always been partial to fairy tales that tell what ""really happened."" I never really bought into the whole idea of happily ever after. Don't get me wrong I love a happy ending as much as the next person, but I want to know why.In Just Ella, Ella learns what it really means to live happily ever after. She makes her own destiny and finds out what it means to love, but most of all she does it with style.I like this book because it has a strong heroine who knows what she wants and then finds out a way to get it. Life in the palace may be a little extreme, but Ella has the ability to cope with it.I would recommend this book to teen-age girls who are wondering what kind of power they have in this world."
3,Not what I expected....,"The continuation of the Cinderella fairytale is wonderful. Ella really ""grows up"" in this book and starts to make her own decisions. However, I found the character herself didn't seem to fit the time period. The book is set in a medieval setting and Ella is supposed to be 14 years old. At times the author treats her as a child and at others times like someone in their mid-20's. Also, the character's attitude and speech was more like someone of the 20th/21st century, making it difficult to place her in this period. It was hard to keep a consistent image of the character as I read the book.I may be overly critical as I was expecting GREAT things from Margaret Peterson Haddix. Her book ""Running Out of Time"" was magnificent and I was hoping for more of the same quality.Overall, a good book, but not what I expected."
2,Why ruin a good story?,"This book is an alternate ending to ""Cnderella""'s ""happily ever after ending."" If I had known that, I wouldn't have read it. It really makes everything seem so negative. Instead of having a lovely, happy Cinderella dancing around freely in the palace, Ella is locked in a dungeon from which she escapes by digging through the toilet. Prince Charming is and empty headed loser. A well written story, but I would rather not have the end of ""Cinderella"" altered."
4,Just Ella by Margaret Peterson Haddix 218 pages,"Ella, once a maid for her evil stepmother in her own house, has now found herself in the palace with Prince Charming. Throughout this book, Ella has to meet the challenge to adapt to royal life. One day, while teaching the Princess Ella the church's faith, Lord Reston has a heart attack, and Ella finds herself in a new situation, for she meets a new friend Jed Reston, Lord Reston's oldest son. Unlike his father, Jed has dreams to help all those refugees of war by setting up a refugee camp.Ella suddenly sees now that she does not want to marry the prince. But when she tries to call off the wedding, they put her in prison. With the help of her friend Mary, Ella escapes and finds Jed.I like this book and I would recommend it to girls who are 10 and older. It wasn't very hard to read and I enjoyed it a lot. It is a story which shows the other side of the glorious life as a royal and also teaches us how some things happen that you may not expect."
5,"Ella, behind the life of a princess (or prisoner)","This book is so great! If you love the cinderella stories(like Ella Enchanted, too. Not just the original), you'll love this book. It shows what life is like for a princess and it's not exactly pretty if you aren't arrogant or brought up to be one. It shows the other side of fairy tales; where things might not be so 'happily ever after'. As soon as you start, u can't put it down!"
4,Spicy and charming fairy tale,"Just Ella is a ""can't-put-it-down"" sequel to the Cinderella fairy tale that finally answers some of the questions modern readers want to know. How could Cinderella manage to live happily ever after with a guy she only met once? If Cinderella had a fairy god mother, why didn't Snow White have one, too? Why was Prince Charming so entranced by a commoner? Why would anyone want to wear glass slippers, and how did Cinderella manage to dance in them all night without ending up with shards in her feet? I have a few seventh graders in my classes who will read this book and never forget it. But beware: there is language that will make some readers uncomfortable. Realists who like a spunky young woman for their heroine will love Just Ella"
4,A true cinderella story,"Ella is chosen by none other than Prince Charming himself, he wants to marry her. At first she believs she is in love with 'Charm,' but soon comes to find her is boring and dull, dim-witted and believes she should not get to watch duel or do anything at all. She wants to getout of the castle, and is locked in a dungeon for refusing to marry him. She finds a way to escape and soon finds her friend the tutor."
3,sorta hard to follow,"I really enjoed the beginning of this book as well as the idea, but it didn't really keep my interest. Then like 3 different times I tried to pick up where I left off, but it was hard to find my place. It was also hard to follow when I wasn't reading it all at once (or almost.)"
2,Big dissapointment,"Just Ella was Just Horrible! The characters were two dementional boring and very perdictable. The ending was like the author just wanted to finish the book. the only credit i give is that she wrote a new side of a classic story, which has been done already! over all don't waste your money. a good book you can read on this sort of subject is Ella Enchanted. it is very good."
2,Very predictable. Character not really believable.,"It was hard to fathom that such an independent-minded, likable, and thoroughly modern young woman could exist in the society described in the book. In addition, the plotline was extremely predictable--the minute the new tutor was introduced, it was obvious that she was going to fall in love with him and dump the prince. And, although I applaud anyone who wants to work with war refugees, the setup for her interest in this type of work is lame at best. Some of the situations the heroine describes are quite amusing, though. And, her tenacity as she tunnels her way out of the dungeon is admirable."
3,Terribly Predictable,"While this continuation of Cinderella does somewhat make a compelling little tale, it goes wrong. She meets up with a male of her age and right up from there you just know, KNOW she's going to end up with him somehow. I don't want to compare this to other tales out there, but it does seem uncanny that Hendrix comes out with ""Just Ella"" nearly a year after ""Ella Enchanted"". But I must say, it was a simple read... a quick book for the weekend."
5,the anti-fairytale,"Some... er, people... think this book has something to do with Ella Enchanted, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a sequel in any way. Just because both books involve a main character named Ella does not mean it's related. Especially when they're by two different authors! But on with the review.Just Ella is a fabulous anti-fairytale story. It's like a continuation of Cinderella, only everything that had once gone completely right has now gone absolutely wrong. This young woman has done everything to become a princess and wife to the man she thought was her very own Prince Charming, but it turned out that he was only Prince Dull in disguise. So, defying the Cinderella tradition, she refuses to marry Charming and takes fate into her own hands. The book leaves off with Ella having control to do what she pleases, and that's why this book is an empowering message to women (and girls like myself) everywhere."
2,This book was a poor excuse for a sequal,"This book was nothing like ella enchanted. Halfway through the book i started wondering even if it was a sequal at all...for example, in the first book she called the prince Char, in the second, it was Charm...i know its not much of a difference but im picky like that. Plus its by a different author AND she looks completly different on the first cover then she does from the second, she does not have blonde hair!. I was 10 when i read this and it seemed a tad bit adult for me. However if i hadn't read Ella enchanted i would say it was half way decent. But overall i hated it."
3,SADLY DISSAPOINTED,I WOULD BE LYING IF I DIDN'T SAY THAT I WAS DISSAPOINTED AFTER READING JUST ELLA. IT WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MORE ECITIING.I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WOULD BE MORE SIMAILAR TO ELLA ENCHANTED. I ABSOULUTLY ADORED ELLA ENCHANTED. IT WAS MAGICAL FUNNY AND BREATHETAKING. JUST ELLA WAS TOOO REALISTIC AND IT DIDN'T FULLY MAKE SENSE. YOU GET THE FEELING THAT THE AUTHOR DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO THINK THE WHOLE STORY OUT. THIS BOOK SORT OF FELT RUSHED AND REALLY UNBELIEVABLE. IF YOU READ ELLA ENCHANTED I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRIZE IF THIS BOOK ENDED UP REALISTIC. IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT EUNIQUE FELLING THAT OTHER AUTHOR SUCH AS J.K ROWLING AND GAIL CARSON HAD. ALTHOUGH IF YOU JUST WANTED TO READ A SWEET BOOK AND IF YOU WERE BORED. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS OK.
5,It was a really great book!,I thought this was a really good book. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves a good story. I couldnt put it down and found myself reading it untill my eyes closed. I hope people can enjoy this book as much as I did!
4,CindersElla,"Just the book for the preteen-teen group wondering what happened to Cinderella after the prince asked her to marry him. The vocabulary can be challenging for many students at the junior high level, but it is still a fun read."
4,Prince Charming: Shallow Kidnapper,"With all the retellings of Cinderella out there, it's really hard to decide which are worth the read. I'd stop the search right now and read Just Ella. While the original story is retold, it is more of a sequel. I love the twist on it--what if Cinderella's brand new life was worse than her old conditions? If Prince Charming was a bore, and being ladylike just wasn't worth it? Not much seems to happen plotwise in this story, but the idea is pretty amazing. I think Haddix would have ended up with a better story if it was a short story or something to that effect, but it still is a very entertaining read. It both put a feminist spin on it all, and retained its own fairy tale roots (although, no 'happily ever after', actually, I was kind of hoping it would end with those words.) I'm disappointed that there isn't a sequel/there wasn't more to the story, but I'm looking forward to the companion book!"
4,~just her``,Just Ella is written in a totally mannered way for young adults to enjoy. This book is another one of the retold stories ever made but this time Ella didn't really end up with her Prince Charming but Prince Charming turned out to be more like Prince Boring. Ella is struggling to find a way on how she can break her engagement with the prince and find her tutor Jed who can give her what she is looking for.
2,Horrible!,"While I knew this was NOT a sequel to ELLA ENCHANTED, I was still excited to see what might happen in this book. It was awful! It really had nothing to do with Cinderella, and the ending had even less!"
2,A mediocre take on the classic story of Cinderella.,"Have you ever heard that old, somewhat cliched expression: ""Don't judge a book by its cover""? Well, old and somewhat cliched it may be, but it's very true. It speaks for Just Ella. I expected the book to be a great read, judging from the attractive cover which interested me. But the book itself was a disappointment. The characters were all dull and insipid, with the prince being a mean, stupid witless clod and Ella herself rather mundane and un-magical. I don't understand why this book received all the wonderful reviews it did; it doesn't deserve even half of them. A much better book would be Ella Enchanted, by Gail Carson Levine. Now THAT deserved all the reviews it got."
4,Just Ella,"In just Ella, a 15-year-old girl is forced to work for her evil stepmother after her father died ( sound familiar?). Like every commoner in her town she dreams of marrying the young good looking Prince Charming, and having a luxrious life in the palace. When she was choosen by the Prince at the ball she finds herself trapped between etiqutte, and people trying to force her to be something that she is not and does not want to be. After she told the Prince she did not want to be married to him she was locked in a dungeon till she changed her mind about the marriage. She must now choose between being a princess or happiness. Can she choose what is right and live happily ever after?"
2,Bland drivel,"The concept was interesting, but the magic wasn't there. Spare me, please, the anachronistic medieval maidens with the politically correct agenda of today. This story, if well-written, could have been beautiful in its own way but I found the dialogue and the narration plodding and painfully dull. As many other reviewers have noted, there was none of the enchantment one wants when reading a fairy tale. I actually rolled my eyes during some of the more self-righteous passages. The characters were stereotypical and dull, especially Prince Charming. A good writer surprises and delights her readers and that didn't happen here."
4,Just Ella,"This book is very creative and awe-inspiring for young readers and the upincoming authors of today. This book shows the creativeness of the author in seeking beyond what we have established as Cinderella, no one really knew what happened to her after ""Happily ever after"" This book shows that even the most gold coated situation, that every girl has dreamed of at least once, can be not so appetizing as thought. I think that this book is a must read for fans of Ella Enchanted and The Two princesses of bamarre."
4,Happily ever after?,"Is happily ever after really happy? For Ella (Cinderella), once reality sets in and she finds out what is expected of her as a princess and gets to know Prince Charming, she realizes that maybe she has not chosen a life that will satisfy her. I really enjoyed this book because the story was well told and characters well written but also because Ella doesn't need a fairy godmother to help her change her life."
3,A poor Cinderella,"Having read many novels based on the story of Cinderella and other fairy tales, I felt that this one was not on the same level as other great stories, such as Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. I liked that this novel took place after Cinderella's marriage, yet the author could have done a much better job with such a good story. I did not like Haddix's style of writing and found her protagonist and the protagonist's love interest underdeveloped, as was their romance. Hopefully, some other author will produce a better continuation of Cinderella's life."
4,A very good book,This book is very good because is like the Cinderella but they don't are in love instead Ella just want to escape.
4,my review may have spoilers. just saying,good book cinderella. spoof on cinderella. what is prince charming ISNT so charming? what if hes a stuck up brat tha u haveto marry or go and live in the dungen until u reconsider? hmmm?
2,"To People who LOVED ""Ella Enchanted""","PLEASE DON'T READ THIS EXPECTING IT TO BE A SEQUAL TO ""ELLA ENCHANTED""!!! If you read and loved the book ""Ella Enchanted"" and expect this to be a continuation, please don't read it w/that expection. My friends and I were hoping that it was a continuation to ""Ella Enchanted"" and so excited, but we had too high expectations and this book ruined everything ""Ella Enchanted"" stood for. If you haven't read ""Ella Enchanted"" yet (shame on you!), then yeah, you probably will like and love ""Just Ella"" b/c you don't know any better. I DON'T want to discourage anyone from reading this book b/c its not that bad. If you try to forget ""Ella Enchanted"" while you read and succeed, you'll think its wonderful.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE just don't expect it to continue ""Ella Enchanted"" b/c it will just ruin everything. Pretend its a separate story w/no relationship and you'll be fine. :)"
4,Just Ella,"Do you like the classic tale of Cinderella but wish that there was more adventure? Then join Ella in Just Ella by Margaret Peterson Haddix. 15-year-old Ella is engaged to Prince Charming. But then she starts to realize that she doesn't have the same love for him as she once thought she had. As the story progresses, you can imagine almost every paragraph in your mind. This book takes the story of Cinderella into dramatic twists and turns.We think that this book will attract young adults everywhere, (particularly girls/women) because of its unpredictable plot. Some parts are not as interesting as others, but Haddix has done it again. ALA says that it is a best book for young adults and that it is a quick pick. We would strongly recommend this book for people who like classic, fantasy, and somewhat adventuresome books. So join Ella in her descriptive experiences.By: Katie Melissa Jones"
5,Nice Collection,"This 3 CD Box Set is a good deal. You get the first three Madonna albums: Madonna (1983), Like A Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986), all for one low price. This is a nice place for new fans of Madonna fans to start, because you would get all three cds for a good price."
3,Carl's Birthday,"Be very careful if you intend to direct ship this to a recipient. No one loves Carl more than I, so I was eagerly looking forward to starting a new friend on her collection. My first book arrived and to my shock had page 10 one-third obliterated by a yellow ink swath. I returned the book and quickly received a replacement. WITH THE SAME DEFECT!!!!!!!!!! Frustrating calls to customer service only produced the suggestion that I try again and hope for the best. No one is apparently capable of opening this simple book and checking for the misprint. After notifying the publisher of Amazon's sale of second quality books, I cancelled and ordered from Barnes and Noble. I would be even more upset if this had been sent as a gift. You take your chances with this one. Sheila in NC"
4,Background Sounds.....,"This is an excellent cd. I was particularly impressed with the background vocals. Then I read the liner notes and found that one of my favorite singers/artists, Wendy Moten, did a lot of the backup vocals on this release."
5,Awesome,"Londa is a real down to earth and transparent Christian woman whom God has decided to use in an awesome way. I can feel her love of God through her music which truly ministers to me. She even has a few songs that I can dance to, which is cool."
1,Not worth it,"Poor read, although interesting premise. Lost interest very quickly. Finished reading it although it was an effort."
1,Incorrect book,Unfortunately the book listed and the book sent were not the same. Communications and return were handled quickly and professionally.
3,Chihuly Baskets,Book in bad condition. Will definitely search for another. Was informed of some faults but not all. Happy to have in the mean time.
5,Great Overview of Naval History,"I have a couple of other books by Rodger, and as with all of them, I highly recommend this one for anyone interested in the history of Britain's wooden navy. Very informative; great stuff."
2,Nice try.,"Every cover singer eventually yearns to do Tin Pan Alley and other classic songs (think Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle), but you don't usually expect that from someone who writes her own material. Therefore I didn't quite know what to expect. But since some of these songs are old favorites of mine, I figured it was worth a try. I was wrong. I really love Julie London's classic rendition of ""Cry Me a River,"" and this version doesn't come close. Ditto for ""Chansons des Vieux Amants"" on Judy Collins's classic ""Wildflowers"" album; Alison certainly knows how to sing in French, but she's no Celine Dion. ""Windmills of Your Mind""--eh. ""The Man I Love""--eh. I'll be reselling this one so if you want to pick it up cheap, wait for it. ^_^Apparently there's some really sad drama behind Alison's lack of any new music in this century. I hope it comes to an end soon. I'm looking for more songs like ""Hoodoo,"" ""Footsteps,"" ""Rise"" and ""Whispering Your Name."" Something that will help me forget this CD."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Moyet's take-no-prisoners alto since the Yaz days, and I always knew she had more legitimate music in her. This album hints at that, but never quite lives up to the potential. Her phrasing is dreadful -- she likes to take big noisy breaths between significant words. A few tracks succeed, like the two French-language songs, the English folk song, and ""What Are You Doing The Rest of Your Life,"" with those amazing sweet old lyrics by the Bergmans. Other choices like ""The Man I Love"" and two Elvis Costello numbers have been done better by singers from Ella to Audra. Even the pitch-impaired Gwen Stefani did a better job with ""Amost Blue."""
2,"Boring ""old people"" cd","I'm a huge Alison Moyet fan but this album is disappointing. A ballad laden lackluster album. Where is the old Alison Moyet? I understand she develops as an artist but unfortunately not into the right direction. This is a boring ""old people"" cd. Alison, you are at your best when you have a producer who pushes your voice to the limit. You also need a more crisp sound. This is so outdated. I already fell asleep after the first song. My guess is that you personally like this sound because the folks from your record company must have told you differently. Probably also the reason why this album gets released almost a year after it's original release in England.Alison Moyet is probably one of the best singers ever (without exageration)! When you hear her voice you get immediately captivated. In that sense this album is appropriately titled. Unfortunately this is where the meaning of the word ""appropriate"" ends. Alison, snap out of it!!!"
4,Mooie CD,Mooie CD met heerlijke nummers. Vooral de eerste (Windmill) is prachtig gezongen en heerlijk om naar te luisteren.
5,Simply Astonishing,If you are a Moyet fan this album is an absolute must! It highlights Alison's voice with arrangments by Ann Dudley.
3,Kind of dated,"Not bad for an astrology book, but some of the commentary is a little dated. The segments on compatability between signs especially have a bit of a sexist tone. It's great for basic information on each sign, but ladies look elsewhere for career advise, unless you really wanna know how good you'd be as a housewife."
4,Nice headphone amp,"This amplifier does exactly what they claim.Pros:Easy to useCompact2 headphone outputsBatteries are held securelyCons:AAAA batteries are difficult to find and a little pricey (order them from Amazon when you order the Boostaroo)Cords supplied are not compatible with 1st generation iPhone headphone jackMust remove input jack to turn off powerBatteries are a little difficult to insertOverall, it's a nice unit that works as advertised."
2,BAD SOUND QUALITY,"Although this product does enhance the volume to a certain extent, the sound quality lacks. I was disappointed to not get the true sound quality projected out of this product."
4,It works well,"Has a couple of quirks (like to turn it on, you plug in your I-pod), but it is, for my purposes, a useful piece of electronics."
5,Jackalope Junction's Just Drive,An excellent mix of styles!First rate songwriting by David Isaacs & AMAZING vocal work by Catherine Miles!!!!!!All performances are top notch & worth buying a copy or two or three......And I'm NOT just saying that becuase they're friends of mine!:)
3,Picture inaccurate !,Please update your photo ! It's not accurate as you are selling an item without Valves !!!
4,Nice piece of plastic,This is the box without the valve. Includes the enclosusure and detachable side mounts The box is plenty deep allowing for enough way space for valve operation
3,Hugely entertaining demented fun....,"The Kirkus review is far too harsh for this fast-paced terrifically entertaining romp through a sort-of possible but brightly imagined near-future. While the worlds of the drugged-out loser and the billionaire scion seem a bit contradictory, its worth it just to go along on Christensen's whirlwind tour of a possible, particularly lousy future."
2,Too much and not enough,"Too self-consciously hip for its own good. Christensen's hyperactive style can't hide the fact he has no story and nothing interesting to say. Each sentence seems to wink to the reader and say ""isn't this cool? I know cyber-lingo."" One of the most boring books I've ever read."
5,Pure Magic,"Lush, inspiring harmonies; meaningful, uplifting lyrics; and musical hooks that only get better with time. This is how the Forester Sisters wanted to sound all along and it's a treat to hear them ""really rock!"" as they put it. The title cut and ""Love & Time"" are a MUST listen while you're driving down the highway. The album's spiritual theme, combined with the magical harmony of the Forester Sisters, makes this their all-time best album....to date. I'm still waiting for more!"
5,The title for my review...,"I heard of Schleprock from my brother. He said it was his favorite CD. When I saw it ""used"" i decided what the hell...and bought it without ever hearing anything from the band. This is one of the best Cd's in my collection. Not only does it have catchy tunes and good beats, it has well written lyrics. I reccommend you all buy it."
2,Definitely Not Green Day,"This is not good. This band tried to make every song a hit with some type of hook that the whole song revolves around, but it doesn't work. The lyrics are all things heard before and the music is weak even when turned up to the maximum. I guess they were trying to be like Green Day, but they sound nothing like them, and there's no punk attitude here at all. No wonder these guys totally disappeared from the scene after scoring a minor hit with ""Suburbia,"" the only decent track on this album."
2,Not 20 and 28 ga tico tool,"This was the 20 ga model not the 20/28 ga model. Works fine for 20 ga, but too large for the 28 ga."
3,pleasent viewing,"Koch was a type setter with qualifications in Theology.Primarily the works value is asthetic, I find it worth owning as a cheap collectable addition to my shelf.Brief histories of each sign have a slight Christian slant, although not over bearing.Illustrations are made from beautiful wood cuts and the type is of his own design.Besides peeking the interests of occultist and broad minded Christians it is considered of value by graphic artists."
2,The Book of Signs (Dover Pictorial Archive) (Paperback),This is the second Dover Pictorial book I have purchased and I was disappointed with both editions. This book at least has the meaning listed below the symbol. I bought this book as a reference material for a graphic symbolism class and was unable to find anything I needed. The book contains a general overview and is a very basic piece of reading material which may be good for beginners on the subject.
5,Maybe the best single ever,"I'm totally drunk out of my mind right now, but I'm playing some Liz Phair right now and was scrolling through my mp3 collection thinking about how I'd like to hear all three of these songs (Cave, Host, Coma). This is definitely one of the best singles ever. I have only purchased Radiohead singles, but this one might be better than all those. Muse's two best songs are the b-sides and the a-side is the most mature song on Showbiz. I might buy this sucker right now, but I'm drunk. So, yeah. I've corrected so many spelling mistakes. Coma is the best Muse song, Host may be the second best. Buy this, if you have the money."
4,Rules of the game,"Good read. Fast, entertaining, and enjoyable.Another good book from Nora Roberts.Made a quite afternoon go by rather quickly."
4,Good,"What I didn't realize was that this book was previously published under Forever. On the second page I realized that I already had it so I was more than a little bit frustrated with myself for paying for it again. However with that said I did read it again because it was a good story.I love Nora Roberts and always enjoy her work. I really like both characters, strong development and great chemistry. Brooke Gordon has a rough history and has learned not to trust people. She doesn't want to ever have to need anyone again. Already successful in her career, she thinks she is satisfied in her life; until a head strong baseball player literally lands in her lap. Parks Jones was at the top of his game and always got what he wanted, and he wanted her. I found Parks to be a great hero who wasn't afraid to go for it. If you like Nora Roberts you'll like this book, just make sure you don't already own it. :)"
5,Flows smoothly,The story line keeps my attention as well as the character development. The setting was colorfully described in adequate detail.
2,Ehh,Not the finest piece of literacy I've ever read. Ms. Roberts seems to be struggling with topics of book ideas.
2,Rules of the Game,"I am such a huge fan of Nora Roberts, I wa so disappointed with this book. She's definitely gotten better as she's written more. Sex doesn't equate love - in my opinion - and that's what this book was telling me."
4,Very much worth it!,My 8-year old son has a lot of K'Nex and loves to build. He has built just about everything the K'Nex booklet has. This gave him more ideas and he just keeps building and building!
3,Buena opción,"Es una libro bueno, aunque existen modelos que les falta intrucciones más detalladas y solo tiene la imagen final, pero con un poco de imaginación y paciencia se pueden lograr armar los modelos."
3,Very slow going.,"Greenwood has written some wonderful books. This isn't one of them. It's very slow and tedious before you get into the meat of it (halfway into the book). Hetta is so down on herself she makes me depressed. It probably would make any ""plain"" looking girl shoot herself. The hero's is wonderful. The story is ok. I've read a lot worse but like the other reviewer I had to struggle to keep reading it."
1,A waste of paper.,"This book was a real bummer compared to Texas Homecoming, which I really enjoyed. I couldn't finish it because I was bored to tears, and I usually will try to finish a bad book in the hope that it will improve as I read. But I gave up on this one. Halfway through, I was completely irritated with Hetta's whiny attitude. The 'I'm plain looking and you're so handsome' on page after relentless page finally got to me and I quit reading it. Texas Homecoming is worth reading, but this wasn't."
3,Track 2 is the wrong group,"Track 2 is not the JVC Force.It's Man Parrish featuring Freeze Force. So it's actually three songs listed wrong, instead of just two songs."
1,Defetive Product Seller Irresponsible,The dvd has problems. It does not play well on my TV. It stops at certain point and clips. I cannot view it. I requested a return but the seller said it was over 90 days and he did not do anything about it.
4,near perfect peacemakers,"the raw powerful vocals are acompanied by one of the best alt-country bands that has ever been assembled. the songwriting is original and extremely creative. while a few songs on the album are a bit eccentric and comical, it is in a good way. i cant believe a major record label hasnt signed this band!! they are one of the best i have heard in a long time, and i hope the world gets a chance to hear their music. they will probably be as blown away as i am :)"
1,Not just a waste of money but also a waste fo time,Organisations are complex structure and different organisations exist in different competitive environments and most of all provide different services.Unfortunately this book does not take account of the differences. It draws black and white pictures of the organisation and its processes. It does not go into detail in how to structure and implement Target Costing and where the hurdles and challenges are.It is full of buzz words that sound great but have not real meaning.Worst of all is that one could summarise the 350 pages of the book to a maximum of 30 pages without loosing content.
2,Disappointing Effort from Princeton Review,"Given the relatively high quality of the Princeton Review organization, this book has a surprising number of inadequacies. The explanations of many of the so-called ""correct"" answers on the practice tests are illogical or wrong. This is particularly notable in the reading and and argumention sections. The Essay section gives smart tips and and is fully adequate, given how little weight schools put on it. I found the games section the strongest part of the book, both the text and the practice test questions.To maximize your score, You would be far better served by practicing on the official LSATs realeasesd by ETS and sold as 10 More Actual, Official LSAT Preptests ISBN: 0942639804. If you want an full-length official explanations of selected questions, get LSAT Official Tripleprep Plus put out by ETS ISBN 0942639758."
1,A very poor choice.,"The Princeton Review LSAT book suffers from many deficiencies. Chief among them are poorly constructed, badly worded, or just plain incorrect practice problems. This stems, in large part, from their tendency to generate their own practice problems, ('similar' to LSAT problems), rather than using actual LSAT questions from old exams released by the testing agency.Buying volumes of old, actual LSATs, as suggested by previous reviewers, is certainly a better strategy. But if you want explanations, instructions and analysis, in addition to just questions and answers, I suggest the two Kaplan LSAT books. Their basic LSAT book provides a good overview of the test, and it uses real questions from previous exams. Their LSAT 180 book explores a number of particularly difficult questions from old LSATs and explains how to tackle them. This is useful for the advanced student aiming to turn a good score into a great one."
1,Jason,"I have the 2003 version of the book. It isn't a really good resource. The section on arguments is mediocre. The section on logical games is pretty bad with complicated diagram designs that are probably inapplicable at this point. I bought a book from NOVA Press that was a little better. However, I found that nothing beatsactual practice on the tests and recognizing the common types of flaws in the answer choices. I bought the logic games bible book, but I still haven't found much aid with those pesky games."
4,A wonderful blend of sonic textures...,"Blending Arabic and Flamenco stylings with modern dance beats, Alabina have created a truly infectous melange. Recalling the early '90s collaboration between Anne Dudley from Art of Noise and Jaz Coleman from Killing Joke, this track has an exotic and cinematic quality, rich in it's tapestry of sound, yet remaining uniquely danceable."
3,Lynda Carter Does It Again,"While I'm not about to glorify the movie as an artistic masterpiece by any means, this is a pretty good movie about the falls of many 'bunnies'. This movie takes a look at three different women and thier motivations for posing for Playboy and the repercussions that befall them afterward. Lynda Carter plays a middle aged house-wife and mother who decides that she still 'has it' and poses for the adult magazine. She then has to endure the ridicule emposed on not only herself, but also those thrown at her husband and children. If you're a fan of Lynda Carter, don't miss out on this great 80s classic."
1,"Typical ""Lifetime"" Channel afternoon movie.","Rather than the tittilation you would expect, this made for TV movie focuses on the lives of the three subject women who pose for Playboy magazine. Seconds of slightly racy photo sessions are supplemented by hours of typical hollywood family conflicts, i.e. Husband likes wife posing for playboy, then changes mind; Parents are mortified then forgive; Children are teased at school; then forgive mom. This old dog has been rerun numerous times. Save your money."
3,For Lynda Carter Fans,"The primary purpose anyone would view this movie is to get a good dose of Lynda Carter. Typical TV movie fare other than ""Wonder Woman"" plying her craft as a soon to be middle-aged housewife who tries to prove she still has what it takes for Playboy."
5,Old book. Facinatingly relevant.,"The first chapters are full of information in simple English about the history of sewage, including pictures.(The dead horse and kids playing in an open sewer is one picture that remains with me since I purchased the book 2nd hand at 11th grade 20 years ago!).The book shows where the current system is leading us, and clearly states what is needed. It checks what type of people use composting toilets, where they hoped to apply them (20 years ago and same today) and what the problems are. The rest of the book has detailed plans, bibliography and pictures of alternatives that were available then, including experience. Although not always very clear, it's fun reading.<strong>And still an excelent source.</strong>"
5,A gret book based on personal experience & knowledge with lots of useful information.,A gret book based on personal experience & the acadimic knowledge with lots of useful information about what to expect from the followers of mohammad and islam.
1,Islam is not an evil religion,"I disagree strongly with the author for the big majority of Muslims have different understanding of Islam than he does. If Islam is an evil religion, my question to the author is: How did Islam attracted over one billion followers and survive for almost 1500 years?"
1,THE CONFLICT IS IN THE AUTHOR'S BRAIN,"The only truth here is that you can write a book attacking other people religions to make some money to pay your wireless bills. The author has showen bias and an extreme ignornace about the islamic religion though he said that he graduated from Al-Azhr univeristy, no wonder he did not continue for so long. I dare him, if he has the courage and the nerve to write about the other hollybooks of Jews and christians. ohhh Did I hear someone say ""destroy every man, woman and child and all the innocent animals"" in the O.T. I guess he will have a hardtime to review other hollybooks because they were written by many different authors. Hollycow I wasted time and money."
5,My favorite form of jazz,"Brad's music is excellent for background or close listening. innovative styling from piano, bass, and drums. If you like Brad Mehldau, you'll enjoy this disc. If you have never experienced him, give it a try. I'm sure you'll be pleased."
5,This artist is awesome!,Thank god we have nouveau jazz artist that can make records like this i am impressed.
4,Good Choice of Compositions,"I saw Brad Mehldau perform at the Nice Jazz Festival, and I can therefore attest to the power this trio wields when they perform.That being said, this is one of the more interesting albums in his catalogue. The reason for this is that this album, the first installment in his ""Art of the Trio"" recordings, perfectly manifests both Mehldau's gift for interpreting jazz standards as well as writing interesting, original compositions. In concert, the trio will blend songs from both categories into fascinating medleys. Here the songs are sequenced well, and you begin to grasp the depth of Mehldau's influences.I would recommend this recording as an ideal introduction to one of the most genuine and interesting artists in jazz today."
5,If you read Ishmael you must read this!,"This is the followup to Ishmael and if you've read Ishmael, you must continue with this. This is the story of a Laurentain priest who is assigned to investigate a man known only as B, who is spreading the word. The Laurentains have a special mandate: to identify and suppress the Antichrist. The story is fine but is secondary to the message of saving the world. What was revealed in Ishmael is brought into blinding clarity here. We're in big trouble folks. We may not realize it but I can guarantee after reading this you too will realize things must change regarding population growth or we will extinct ourselves. The increasing rates of population doubling over the past 10,000 years stunned me. Please please read this and pass it on to others. This is the most important novel you will read."
5,A life changing expierence,"The Story of B is the single most powerful book that I have ever read. As a novel it holds onto the readers imagination and interest like the best of suspense writings. As a social statement, it's message breaths life into what might seem an uninviting and pathetic future for our planet, and humankind. More than recomend this book, I challange everyone to read it, and TRY to come out without a whole new view of the world. A highly recomended and equally powerful book, though in a completly different voice is My Ishmael. How lucky the world is to have a thinker like Daniel Quinn."
5,life-changing book,"This book really changed the way I look at the earth and the human race. Quinn gives a really unique and compelling view of human evolution, with special attention given to the agricultural revolution and its course-changing impact on humans. The resulting population curve is indeed going to threaten us, and while I didnt feel this book gives direct 'answers' (it is fiction, after all) it definetely gets you thinking in the right direction. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys perspective-challenging ideas or who has environmentalist tendencies. I also recommend it to people who long to have a better understanding of the human situation, our history and our fate. All things aside, the fictional story he presents is rather suspenseful."
5,Quinn's 'B',This is a great book. All of Quinn's books are great. I liked the condition of it and it arrived just as they said it would.
5,The Sky really IS falling.,"A profound examination of the current state of the planet, how we got here today, and what, unfortunately, seems to be the future... Thought provoking, disturbing, galvanizing, irrefutable."
1,It's fluffy,"I have to confess that English is not my first language. 'Fluffy' is the best word for me to describe the book for now. The content is like a fluffy rabbit's fur, you just don't get much real thinking out of it. Disappointed.I bought this book because I want to know better about how the world looks like in religious people's eyes. I was pretty critical about religious, but then Yann Martel's famous ""Life of Pi"" changes my point of view of religious, apart from many other things. I'm highly recommending his book."
2,"The Story of B is not ""an adventure of the mind and spirit.""","This is book was a waste of time for me. While reading it, I stuck with it because I was hoping that it would have an ending that would make it worth it, but that doesn't ever happen. The ultimate flaw with the book is that it pretends as if its offering some kind of revolutionary ideology and it doesn't. It also suffers in that it makes allegations and criticisms, without backing them up, or offering solutions. The book comes off as some sort of weird propaganda, which makes it really hokey. Do yourself a favor and read something else."
5,Important novel that will change your impression of mankind,"There is so much to say about this great book, too much to put into a couple of paragraphs. Along with Ishmael and Providence, The Story of B has reshaped my belief systems and opened my eyes to the truth. They have revealed to me the myths that we(mankind) base our lives on, and live according to. This book is so inspiring that there is a website devoted to it:http://www.bnetwork.com/messages/guestbook.htmlPlease feel free to visit it, and learn more about the book."
5,Rip Van Wrinkle coming out of his sleep.,"I think both books have some truths in it. I am awakened to find there is a nation of people who did fall asleep they lost 10,000 of their history and Quinn has been bold enough to put it in fiction. What a revolution the question is now when the people wake up from the forgettfulness does anyone knows what that will do to the world or will the world already be at the end of its story and those people ascended to the blue ethers from the disaster.Science is beautiful. Creation is something unseen yet everything manifested is after creation. The thought was the creation. What a mighty good thought it is. Leavers. Leave this place of limited life. A hologram. When one knows that begins must end. They have meet the leavers.....Leavers never began and they will never end."
3,Reviewing B,"The Story of B is a novel of different themes and paces. In some parts, the book moves very slowly, in others I found myself gasp in reaction to the plot twists. This novel makes you look at human history and cultural beliefs in a completely different light. However, sometimes all these revelationsd and theories are clumped together so closely that I had trouble taking all of it in. Although The Story of B wasn't filled with melodramatic emotions, there were some scenes that were very touching at a spiritual level. At times, I had to force myself to absorb all of the revolutionary ideas, but in the end, I benefitted. My suggestion to someone about to read this novel would be it although it is initially hard to follow. It also helps if you read the speeches in the back as they appear in the story"
1,Profoundly disappointing,"In Ishmael, Quinn works some safe and sound philosophy/theology into an interesting package that is a tidy introduction to systems-thinking, deep ecology and some other big ideas. In The Story of B, he wraps all the weak points that we were willing to overlook in Ishmael in a sagging story that regularly requires heroic resuscitation. This book could have built on the first and become a marvelous exploration of transcendence and universal Spirit. Instead, he chose to present us with what feels like the loosely collected leftovers of the first draft of Ishmael."
2,A disappointment of the mind and spirit,"Quinn's attempt to set his ideas against those of the established church are really pretty lame. Even a beginning theologian could argue better than the character Quinn uses as a disillusioned but ""competent"" priest. Although the soaring nature of B's ""world views"" were solid, Quinn's use of the church's reaction against that world view, to establish the ideals of B as against natural law, were extremely weak. I suspect that someone without some religious training might buy into the argument that all religion responds to new ideas the way that Quinn depicts. But I thought his arguments very weak and shallow. Too bad, too, because ""B's"" world views need to be heard, even in the religious community."
5,My all time favorite,"I love this book. It made so much sense to me. I've read it so many times and I've shared it with others. I think this is the best of the 3 books (Ishmael, Story of B and My Ishmael). Gripping and suspenseful. Yet, the logic in the book is impeccable. Wonderful read. You won't regret it. And you will probably share it with others too. One thing: even though I wax lyrical about this book, I've found that some people are threatened by the message in the book. This book delivers a very inspiring message using fiction."
3,A more detailed look at The Story of B,"I have reviewed this book, but the review is too long for this page. It may be seen at:http://www.outdoingit.com/~taggart/philosophy/story_of_b.review.html"
2,Disappointing for an Ishmael fan,"I bought this book because of my great love for Ishmael. I found Quinn's first book to be very unique and thought provoking. Because of this, I was really disappointed by The Story of B. The tales in the book are the same as the ones in Ishmael (i.e. the Boiling Frog example). This ruined the book for me, because I was seeking a continuation, not a reiteration, of Ishmael. Maybe if I had read this book first I would not be so cyncial, but it really was a let-down after my expectations had been raised by Ishmael."
2,Ehh...,"The ExamKrackers books offer far more practice questions in MCAT format, and seem to offer better test-taking advice. I find it easier to carry around one or two of the ExamKrackers volumes than this 1,000 page behemoth. For my money, Barron's is a steal -- 4 good practice tests for under $20 -- a shame their comprehensive review is not very useful. Have not tried Princeton Review, but Amazon reviewers warn that the P.R. text has more than a few errors. Caveat emptor.What Kaplan does that the others don't is to break down types of passages and types of questions. I'd rather have more practice material."
3,Overall a very good place to start,"I have used the MCAT material on the CDs before. After studying other MCAT material regularly for about 12 weeks, I cracked open this book and software, and took the practice exams over the course of 4 weeks. I got this book dirt cheap using the strategies given in this other book me and my roommate brought from admissionsmystery. com which also a very insightful book. This book at times is humbling and punishing. The reading passages are long and confusing. Nonetheless, this book was pivotal in me achieving a high MCAT score. Yet of course you are taking the MCAT, you are going to having more reference material than this book."
3,Not Ugly But Not pretty,I expected this book to be as good as the books Kaplan has for their class courses but I was very disappointed. I guess you cannot get the same quality which you get for paying for a Kaplan prep course. I found this really neat book written by some Ivy med students at secretroute-dot-com this book talks a lot about med school admissions strategy. Good luck and keep studying!!!
4,CLASSIC ELECTRO,"THIS IS A NICE COMPILATION. YOU GET SOME RARE TRACKS LIKE TECHNO SCRATCH, D.E.F. MOMENTUM AND SITUATION HOT. A LOT OF THESE SONGS YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE UNLESS YOU GET THEM ON 12"" RECORD. SO UNLESS YOU HAVE A TURNTABLE I SUGGEST YOU PICK THIS UP."
2,Dig a little deeper,So-so effort of late 80's 'rolling' music. Some gems. Some not-so-great cuts. Buy it if you can't find certain songs elsewhere.
1,from a,"Sorry, no arguments will convince me to relativize the following fact: at the time of her political activity, Ana Pauker had to know the criminal (genocidal, to be accurate) nature of the political party she was a leader of. My mother still cringes when she remembers the slogan ""Ana Pauker si cu Dej - baga spaima in burgeji"" (Ana Pauker and [Gheorghiu] Dej scare the bourgeois) cried out at forced mass rallies. The ""bourgeois"" mentioned in this aggresive rhime had reasons to be scared of Pauker. Hundreds of thousands Romanians are estimated to have been emprisoned for political reasons, thousands of them tortured and killed, burried without a grave. Pauker believed she can ""change things from inside?"". Would _you_ join the Nazi party (for example) to improve its ethics???"
3,"Pretty good, but expected more.","I bought this toilet because my options were VERY limited. The space we fit the toilet into is small from front to back. It looks great, arrived unscratched, and works. The one problem: The tank lid does not fit flush as it should. One of the interior components is too tall and keeps the tank lid from sitting properly in its place. This would not be a major problem if it were not an expensive fixture. But it is."
1,Beware of Kohler one-piece toilets,"I've just gone through a nightmare simply replacing a toilet seat. Rather than the standard arrangement where the bolt and wing-nut go through the whole bottom unit, or the nut is reachable through the back of the water tank, many of Kohler one-piece toilets use anchor bolts that embed in the toilet unit itself. There is no way of replacing the seat without a special kit that normally costs $47.00. Kohler may be aware of the problem and now might give away a kit and a tool. A real hassle. Read product reviews on the Net about seat replacement."
1,unfixable piece of junk,"The seat cracked after someone who might have been 160 lbs used the toilet. I was annoyed but thought I would just buy a new toilet seat and replace it, like I have a few times over the years in other houses, on other toilets. Nope, not with this one. The bolts don't protrude on the underside like they do with most conventional two piece toilets and are completely inaccessible except for the end the screwdriver mates with on the top. Those were utterly frozen, even with my husband putting all his weight on it (he's a big guy, little over 200 lbs), and turning as hard as he could.So rather than paying my plumber to come out and try to drill these out and put something here, it's gone. $550 piece of junk. Don't buy these - if the seat cracks or breaks, you're done."
2,I used to like it,Frogger was a great game on my old computer.the problem with this game is it is not compatible with the newer versions of Windows.I don't know who well it would work with virtual PC but i don't think that is made for games anyway. if you kept your old pc around by all means give this a try
2,"I know Frogger is a classic, but...","I don't like Frogger. Never have. This version was received to me as a Christmas gift (gee, I seem to say that in EVERY one of my reviews!) and I hate how difficult it is. Yes, the difficulty lies in maneuvering, but it's *really* hard. Even the very first level (the street level) is pretty tough. Finally reaching and failing the cloud level (over and over again) is when I finally said ""no more!"" and pulled the game from the computer. This was 5 years ago and I'm still happy about the decision."
5,One of the best books I ever read.,"This book was so good, that I hated to see it end. It made me want to read everything Catherine Anderson had written. The story is sweet and heartwarming. It will put a smile on your face. I would recommend it to anyone because it is really good. It is a feel good book."
4,another winner,As in Catherine Anderson's tradition - once again someone is disabled in some way - and yet finds the true love that everyone dreams for. I cried my eyes out - and if a book can move you to tears - the writer has done their job.
3,A slow read,"I realize everyone has their own opinion, but I cannot give this story a rave review. First off, I can't imagine how grown men could stand around and watch a young girl being raped. This child-like girl whose name is Annie,is deaf and also referred to by her parents as an idiot, moron and imbecile. Then when it is discovered that she has become pregnant from that rape, Alex, the brother of the rapist decides the best thing for her and the unborn child is for him to marry her. Annie's father is more interested in his political position, therefore, she is married off to a complete stranger. To make matters worse, Annie thinks she is getting fat from eating too much. No one has bothered to tell her that she is pregnant. The story goes on, but I'm not sure I will finish it. To me, it is a very sad and depressing story. Again, this is my opinion, and yours may be different. Will continue to look forward to other books by Catherine Anderson."
4,Many Different Emotions On This One,"I have to admit that I liked the story itself but would have liked some changes. I felt the brother should have been dealt with differently he didn't suffer nearly as much as I wanted him to. The author just touched on Annie's father's political asperations, she could have elaborated, I wanted to seek revenge and see him fail for his ignorance, Alex was way to forgiving for my tastes when it came to Annie's family. I hated the ending even if it was happy it was to abrupt for me. I have to admit it was creepy reading about a vertually little girl being lusted after by a man older than her. Alex was a bit controlling for my liking I had alot of anxiety reading this book on Annie's behalf. All my less than positive comments aside I overall enjoyed it. I laughed, cried, got mad, glad, sad and for that I had to rate it 4 stars. Enjoy"
3,Cloyingly Sweet Book,"I'm giving up on Catherine Anderson. I was intrigued by the Handicapped Girl finds gorgeous hunk who is totally devoted to her despite her very real handicap shtick initially, but after the first three books or so, it got very old. Why does the guy have to be perfect in every way? Why does the handicap completely disappear or get fixed by throwing money at it? Where does personal strength, hard-work, and finding a mate who is also handicapped in some way fit in?"
5,avid romance reader,I loved this book. This is the first of Catherine Anderson's books that I have ever read and I certainly intend to read more.
2,Annoying,"I found the heroine's character to be disturbingly naive. I couldn't feel anything for her but pity. It lacked passion and intrigue. The hero was... sweet but a bit of a wimp. I got annoyed with his constant crying, I mean geez. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Interesting book,"It was pretty twisted. I couldn't help but feel that Alex was doing something wrong with Annie. Even though she wasn't mentally ill like everybody thought, including her parents, she was still very child like and had yet to learn sooo much. I kept on getting the feeling that Alex was practically molesting Annie. It all felt very wrong, NOT SWEET, just wrong...."
2,Disapointed but not surprised,I love to read good romances and this was nothing like a good romance. I bought this book because of the reviews here on amazon. I must say that they are a bit misleading. This is not a romance but a love story. And a bad love story at that. I just didn't believe these characterd from jump street. I read chapter after chapter waiting for something to happen with them but it never did. 300 plus pages of pure fluff. Nothing happens in this story and the little that does pass for plot was predictable and clich`e. If you want to read a good book about deafness read Sandra Browns' Eloquent silence. It demonstrates what good writing is all about. Really i think this book would not have been so bad if were about 100 pages shorter.
1,Does a deaf heroine HAVE to be dumb and clueless as well?,I did not like this story. The heroine was so innocent it was unbelievable. A grown woman who doesn't know where babies come from? And the hero cried like a baby at the drop of a hat. What a wimp! Try her other book SIMPLY LOVE. Much better!
5,Kill the Baddies,This game is currently only on demo. I have never played a game where it is similar to the Warcraft interface but it is a strategy game aswell! There are so many ways you can get to the enemy and if you slip up... well say bye bye.Enemies are quick to move and notice every time you slip up. The demo places you in a town that has been taken over by the enemy. Your job is to free the sheriff from the town and then capture the leader of the pack!By the end of the demo it took me nearly 2 hours as it gets harder and harder.A really good game if you have moderate tolerance!
1,Desperados,Could not play it because it was for windows xp and not for windows vista and amazon could not help me find one to work for vista.
1,Frustrating Game!,"The graphics were great, the plot was good, but the game play was frustrating and maddening! The scenerios with just one character are easy, with two or more they are just plain hard to impossible! I couldn't even get through it with the cheats I found! You have to contorl 6 characters simutaneously! If you get frustrated easily, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! There are way too many things to remember, hot keys, etc. Plus, you have to be very fast and besides using the mouse, be prepared to use the hot keys at the same time, usually more than one key like shift + something. Fast action is required, again another hot key. If you have all the time in the world to play and replay a scenerio, then it's a cool game, but if you get tired of seeing the same thing over and over, then it's not. I'm 24 and I finally got so sick and tired and frustrated with the whole thing I got rid of the game! BUYER BEWARE!"
4,A bit hard at points,I thought that this was a good game over all. In it you get a group of people to help you out to fight some bandits. It was realistic and was pretty good. I thought that it was a bit hard though. Your different people have specialties like crawling or being strong. It is pretty good for a western.
3,Fun but could have been much better!,"Have only played it for 412 minutes so far. It keeps track! On level six of 25, though 2 of the ""levels"" were tutorials.Interesting game, but, steep learning curve. No choice in level of difficulty.Get's pretty frustrating. You can't pause and look around and study the map.There are no free standing scenarios or maps.But, it's not too expensiveSo, it's fun for the money."
4,Patient information,"As a Physician Assistant working in Pain Management, I recommend this book to my patients that have chronic pain disorders. It is easy to read and has workbook type activities that make it interactive for the patient."
5,Great book,This book was reccomended by my Dr and it has been a great help in dealing with my pain..
4,excellent basics of flytying book for beginners and above.,"After little formal training and some flytying kit manuals , I found Fling and Puterbaugh's manual. It was just what I needed to continue in my hobby. The authors' include thorough chapters on tools,work environments and materials. Nothing is assumed in this book. Although the sections on insect life cycles are just a brief overview, the specific patterns shown include excellent step by step drawings to walk even a 9 year old through with ease. This text has become my new fly tying instructor"
5,Great Book,This Book is very easy to read and understand. The tips that they point out are time saving. it's great to see that you can sometimes substitute items that you may already have on hand. It would recommend this book to people just starting like I am.
3,"Amusing concept, but not comparable to Adams","I read this because it was compared (by Amazon reviews) to Adam's Hitchhiker series. It has a similar concept, but lacks the wit and style that made Adam's series so popular. For a guy from New Jersey, Like certainly lacks the keen sense of sarcasm that I expected from reading the reviews. The plot plods along and except for the basic concept which set up the story, there wasn't much that was truly humorous. Adam's aliens were funny because they exagerated certain human characteristics. Like's aliens are simply dull. It was funny enough to recommend, but not a 5-star book. For those hungry for more Adams-style humor, I would recommend ""Starship Titanic"" by Terry Jones, a former Python. It was more humorous and more like Adams."
2,Concept: Good; Writing: Bad,"The premise behind this book sounded very interesting. After reading the reviews, I was all geared up to laugh out loud. I didn't at all. Some of the ideas were clever but the bad writing kept getting in the way. And, without giving away the ending, the solution just didn't make sense!"
1,Ingredients list is WRONG!!,"The ingredients listed on Amazon are DIFFERENT than what is on the package. I cannot eat wheat, so I cannot use this product - AND there is no way to complain directly to Amazon (that I can find) and you cannot return grocery items. I am so disappointed with AMAZON!!"
2,Does not taste like real Thai food,"We love thai food, I thought we can try cook it ourselves with the help,of the sauce. Does not taste the same"
3,Skin cream in disguise?,"Followed all the directions, bought all the other goodies necessary for grafting, and it worked like a charm. (Only the first two statements are true.)"
1,Very Poorly made will break easily,"If you're looking to ship these to clients, this is not for you, it will break while in transit because they break if you're not careful opening it. The edges are too thin. I suggest using poly cases."
3,HMMMM...,"While I like this version I will have to say that the original version on Shaman is a little more gritty and sung with a little more meaning because this song has that type of feel... granted this version isn't horrible, it is a well sung on a vocal standpoint."
5,Great song,I strongly recommend this single. Alex Bands voice is so amazing and it fits perfectly into this song. Santana & Alex have done great job. If you like Santanas and The Callings (Alexs band) songs then you should buy this single. ;)
1,awww....is Chad Kroeger too gritty for you?,"After listening, with some frequency, to the ""Shaman"" album, I noticed this song popping up on the radio-waves. Instead of the growling, slightly-angsty version sung by Nickelback's frontman, we get this smoothed-over, watery version that is much more radio-friendly, and is much less appealing."
4,"Temperature data useful, but flip-out stand is useless","Works as described. I was able to warm my hands the first time in about 5 minutes from 70 to 86. After a couple days I can get 92 sometimes. Certainly interesting and a good indicator of stress.But, the desktop stand that flips out of the back only supports it on one side, is very difficult to get out without a knife and is unbalanced and unstable. I had to make my own stand for it.Would have been nice if they included the Velcro strap they described using in the instructions."
3,Brittle wire broke off,"Worked well for many months, however, the thermistor wire eventually suffered from cyclical fatigue where it meets the unit and broke off. If you order this thermometer, you may want to use epoxy (or equivalent) to stiffen/reinforce this wire where it comes out of the thermometer."
1,Junk,"I received mine the other day & the body stress temp ALWAYS reads LO temp. My husband who has consistently warm hands tried it and it still registered LO temp. I don't know how to get it to work correctly. I read the directions many times, took the batteries out and put them back in again and again.This thing is a piece of junk. I'm sorry I wasted my money. I want to give it NO stars but Amazon won't let me.Hopefully the company will let me return this without causing me to lose any money."
5,Stress Thermometer Easy to Learn,"I have orderd two and given them both to people in my family who really needed them. I bought them for me first! lol! I find it a great tool, easy to learn and helpful. I am ordering my third now and I will NOT give that one away. I need to be peaceful, too!"
3,good but for one major flaw,"so, um, i like this, it does what it's supposed to do and i'm sure i will find it useful, BUT... it has no off switch! it's ALWAYS ON! total waste of battery, or you have to take out the battery whenever your not using it. a serious design oversight."
1,Junk!,"This product does nothing! When I tape the sensor to my finger, the temperature is always the same whether I feel totally stressed or totally relaxed."
2,Response is too slow to be of much use,"In the past I have used stress test devices that measure the resistance of the skin. They provide very rapid, very clear feedback. This device is simply a slow acting thermometer.It is of no value to me in comparison with the old skin resistance measurement device that I have lost.The device description claims a lot more than it delivers. It seems to be well made for what it does do."
3,Fluctuates too much to give effective visual feedback,"I have practiced biofeedback (brainwave, heart rate, temperature, galvanic response, etc.) with success using various visual or auditory feedback mechanisms. Usually, but not always, the more expensive the instrument the more effective. When I found this relatively inexpensive stress thermometer, I thought it worthwhile to give it a try. I found temperature change to be quite slow and unreliable with temperatures fluctuating too much to offer effective visual feedback. I suspect the inexpensive thermistor (probe) and ineffective and inconsistent contact of the probe with the skin may be the culprit. I haven't found a way to overcome this problem. Yet. As others have noted, the display is hard to secure. In any case, it was worth a try. And I still have a thermometer I can use to monitor various things around the house and shop."
2,Not Much Good...,"I just got this in the mail and tried it out. So far, it doesn't seem to be a very reliable indicator of my general mood. It just stays around 95 pretty close to normal body temperature. I tried to do both relaxation and think of things that make me stressful, just stays at ""relaxed"" temperature. When I let go of it, it pretty much room temperature. It's 80 degrees in here, hot weather, I'll see what it does in A/C building. Not clear about how ""tight"" I'm supposed to wrap it. Kind of a pain to find tape everytime you want to use it, I would think just pinching it between thumb and forefinger would work. So I gotta give this a C- or D+."
4,stress relief,"For what I paid, the product is ok...does what it says it will do. Not an expensive item, but a good addition to this genre."
2,Not so much!,"The stress thermometer works fine to measure room temperature but the stress levels... not so much... I bought this for fun for the office. Everyone's temp seems to stay the same through out the day. Out of 7 of us, one of us got a two degree different reading when she thought she was stressed... the rest of us had the same temp. It was a fun diversion & everyday someone runs in wanting to read their finger temp to see if their finger knows how stressed they are... & it seems our fingers are oblivious."
2,Very Disappointing CD,"Whoever thinks this CD is good, doesn't know quality freestyle, or quality music at that. The only good songs on the CD are those by Alizee. Jessica is beautiful and a great singer, but her song about HIV isn't cutting it. She usually makes tight songs. You'll see that track #5, ""Sister"", has the potential to be a great song with a phat topic, until SJV manages to screw the song up with some of the worst vocal harmonizing I have ever heard. It sounds like they're singing to a different song or something. It's worth listening to for the Alizee songs, if you make it that far. That's about it. Peace, Keep Freestylin (Quality please)."
2,Not a beginers work out,I work out everyday but I am also over 60 years old. This was just too difficult for me. I could not learn the steps no matter how hard I tried. Best leave it to someone that is either younger or has done some other dance videos. I gave it away.
2,Just OK,"Not my type of exercise tape. I thought I'd like the dancing, but it just is not my cup of tea."
2,Wasn't what I expected,I felt that it was more like an exercise video than a dance video. I only tried it for about 15 minutes and then got frustrated and shut it off. It wasn't what I was expecting .
4,Easy Routine,"I gave it 4 stars because its pretty easy to follow, music is chessy and it easy to get tired if but helps burn calories"
2,Too intellectual for me,I could not get into this book. I think it is more for people who are studying in detail Native American ways. I confess I have not read over a quarter of the book so you may want to try it if you are interested in Native American culture.
4,Wheel Spoke,"This was one of my favorite books in college. I then only was able to find a soft cover edition, twenty years ago. Having a hardcover edition now, in such good condition--better condition than was advertized--brings back many good memories."
5,Visually Dazzling,"I agree with the readers from California and Arizona and commend them on ther fine reviews. I would only like to add that the illustrations, photographs and art work is superb. The paintings by Karen Harris are excellent. They compliment the text in such a way that the experience is even more meaningful. The historical black and white photographs are treasured reminders of a bygone era. The knowledge of the elders is available for those who seek it, add this book to your Native American collection."
3,beautiful book,"""you are about to begin an adventure of the People, the Plains Indian People. You probably have known of the People only by their whiteman names, as the Cheyenne, the Crow and the Sioux. Here you will learn to know of them ans tey were truly known amongh the People....""Incredible photos. sepia portraits, images of camps, crafts, animals central to the Native American way of Life. Color images of medicine wheels with explanations. The story of Night Bear told in the traditional Native storytelling method."
4,Good high speed depth sounder,It was a replacement and worked perfectly with old transducer. It is very useful when running at high speed in shallow waters.
4,Norcross Hawkeye D10D Depth Sounder works great,"The D10D installed easily. After testing the unit according to the manual, I glued the transducer to the inside hull under the engine of the inboard engine compartment as instructed. No holes to drill through the hull. Installation of the display in the dash was simple, as was the wiring. Set up and changing minimum depth is easy. I could do without the three loud beeps when turned on. You'll see it is working on the display. The display is big and easy to read. Operation is simple. The unit worked as advertised, even with the unit pinging through the hull. Quick response and fairly accurate. I tested from known depths of 2.5 feet to 65 feet and was satisfied. Weeds in lake sometimes gives erratic reading."
5,Technical support,"Long story short. Installed the Hawkeye on my sailboat and used through 2010, worked fabulous! Experienced transducer issue in May of 2011. Called Tech Support,actually talked to a human being, described problem, was told this had been an issue on this model, but had been corrected. Bottom line, they cheerfully and promptly sent me a new transducer.The product works GREAT! I would recommend to anyone seeking a depth sounder."
4,Well rounded but not his best 3.5 stars,"DJ Icey was one of the first DJs to get me into any techno. I own all of his CDs. I got a chance to see him live in Minneapolis about a month ago. He definetly tore it up and got the crowd going. This would be a good CD if you are a long time Icey fan, the funky Florida break elements are still found on this CD. Highlights would include the remix of Shakedown's ""At Night"" and Two Lone Swordsmen's ""Neuflex"". I have been a fan of Two Lone Swordsmen for years now and was kind of sad to find in the liner notes that Icey had just found out about them as of late. But back to the point, if you are a first time listener pick up his ""Essential Mix"" album. If you already have that pick up his ""Essential Elements"" album. If you are at that point and dig those albums you will dig on this album as well."
3,I've heard better from Icey...,"I've seen Icey rip it up live twice, great performance both times, had the crowd jumpin', but I've heard better than this from Icey. Pass this one up and grab one of his older releases. One Love, Peace."
4,Not for the faint of heart!,"As a psychiatric nurse, I thought I'd heard all the worst cases of abuse. I was wrong. This woman's experience is truely disturbing. It's a wonder that she isn't permanently catatonic or dead."
4,"great album, good sound","i heard the song ""C'mon"" on the radio and had to buy this album (I still think c'mon is one of the greatest songs ever written). i really like their sound and i hope to see them in concert. theyre so hard to describe that i just cant."
5,Awsome CD!,"I just bought this CD while I was in Washington on vacation, and I have listened to it over 30 times and it just gets better and better everytime, If you want to hear a good CD I would try this one, The Band rocks."
2,Egg Suckin' Dog is right,"Look - this isn't just a Johnny Cash album - this is THE CLASSIC Johnny Cash album - so buy it if you must. But like most Johnny Cash albums, his fine baritone voice and mature masculinity - so refreshing today in a world of Timberlakes and pants-down posers - is interrupted by some of the most excrutiating ""songwriting"" efforts ever.Sure - if you can listen to ""Egg-Suckin' Dog"" without cringing and hunting for the ""skip selection"" on your remote, this album may be just the one you're looking for. Me - I'll take Cocaine Blues from this album and mix it with some of his other fine work from others and try to remember the man at his best. Which doesn't include the song ""Folsom Prison Blues"", by the way. ""I shot a man in Reno? And wound up in a California prison? Does that make sense to anyone? Why didn't you shoot him in Fresno, Johnny? Get me re-write!!"
3,don't stick well,"I could not find this locally went on line and found them. They're what I expected to be fair but they do not stick as well as they use to. I clean the surface prior to attaching, sometimes they stay sometimes not so much."
1,A bad drug trip put into print,"This book is just some bad opium trip. The picture quality is terrible, the instructions difficult to follow ...Most disturbing is the great amount of space given to ""woo- woo"" stuff like black magic and such. It reminds me of the quote by Robert Heinlein, ""One man's religion is another man's belly laugh.""If you are interested in the martial arts aspects of Penjak Silat, you will be gravely disapointed with this book. Though rare, there are other books on the subject. All of the ones I have do a much better job of explaining the basics and principles than this rather strange work."
4,Weather proffed switches,"These encapsulated switches are being used on a 44 year old garden tractor rebuild. As a major part of this rebuild is re-wiring the ignition, starter, and accessory wiring.Since the vehicle is kept outdoors, and used in all weather conditions, I chose these switches to continue to perform in this harsh environment. I only wish that theweather proof handle cover was available in more colors, other than black. I will be using heat shrink tubing to color code the switches by function. NOTE- the image online doesnot represent the product!"
2,Teachers Beware!,I carefully read the reviews of this video and thought it sounded great for my 6th grade students who study Ancient Greece. We do a literature unit on Greek Mythology and this sounded like a good video for the class. It is not! It might be OK for older kids but it really emphasizes the sexual escapades of the Greek Gods. While we are all aware that this is an area of concern this video really plays it up. Teachers beware!
4,Greek Myth Explored,"I've seen this documentry on A&E and I was quite impressed at the depth the film attempted to engadge in. The main gods of Greece were explored, but it failed in the respect that many other documentrys have in that the many 'side' gods of Greece were all but ignored. Still, it was quite informative as the gods that were spoken of were covered to the point that you knew their power and influence over a people that worshiped, loved and feared them. I believe it is very interesting how a group of 'imaginary' gods had so much impact on the daily lives of a people that were very influential on modern thought. I highly recommend this video."
1,Rather disappointing,"I have to say I was rather disappointed with this book. I only wish I had read these reviews prior to buying it!! I was hoping for a book that would really help me appreciate and enhance the knowledge that I had gained from the many how to/what/why books I have read - this unforuntaely did not. As the previous reviews say - if you're looking for an encyclopedia or even glossary style book - then you'll love this. If you're looking for a book that truly enhances your learning and gives you practical knowledge, then look at some of Robert Bruce or Preston Dennett's work."
5,Cd in great shape.,"I received the cd and after listening to it I was very pleased, though it wasn't brand new it was in great shape. There were no scratches on the cd and it played through with no problems. I was happy to have a copy of this cd once again, and if I could find one other that I use to own I would purchase from them again."
5,WOW,"Well, what more could be said about such a remarkable indivisual such as cece?Cece has seased to amaze us all! Unlike previous albums, Cece has created an album that appeals to both believers and non believers alike. By introducing other popular roots, such as, pop, r&b;, gospel, and Contemporary Christian, cece has crossed that fine line that makes her the Incredible artist that she truly is! I believe that to often, Christians sit back and see cece as creating ""Crossing Over"" album or making attempt to find her place in the secular world. But is that not what our lord and savior has called us to do. Our God asks us to be a light in the midst of a dark world in which we live. And i feel that Cece has done an Extrodinary job in reaching and uniting Believers and non believers alike. God has truly blessed her and continues to bless!She takes us on an incredible journey like no other!WOW!"
5,phenomenal!!,"cece's best work, in my opinion. i love it to bits. every single title is a masterpiece, and cece is now in a league of her own. absolutely superb.!!!!"
5,A Spiritual Masterpiece,"There are so many wonderful things to say about this CD. Ms. Winans has amazing vocal talents that shine beautifully on every track. The songs she selected compliment her musical ability and allow the listner to truly enjoy the spirit of each song. Every selection has a powerful message that reaches to the very depths of the soul and tenderizes it for God's Word. There is an obvious progression in CeCe's style that promises to broaden her listening audience and add to her soul-winning ministry. It is wonderful to see that after so much success, CeCe Winans still retains the beauty of the Holy Spirit and has the strength to minister to the world. This is a glorious CD that is a must have for any gospel music lover."
5,"Amazing Voice, FANTASTIC and Uplifting Songs! Buy it!","I have been enjoying this CD for some time now and wanted to share my love for this Artist and her music. Not only is she one of the most amazing vocalists I've ever heard (I too am a Singer/Songwriter),secular or non-secular music, but her music and lyrics are just what we need during these times. Each song will take you on a journey of the heart and mind. Even my 4 yr old loves this CD! Don't hesitate to buy it!"
2,Disappointed fan,"I am a huge fan of Cece Winans and I must admit that I was hugely disappointed over her latest project. It has more of a ""pop"" christian sound than the contemporary gospel sound I was hoping for...similar to her Everlasting Love release. There are only a couple of songs I actually enjoy on this cd."
1,"Sacharrin sweet, with no Filling at all.","This is why Christianity is so hollow in this country. Take an R&B artist, and dash a few ""I love you"" and other generic ""New Gospel"" catchphrases, and Hey look everyone, it's a new Gospel artist. She has talent, but if this is gospel, let's change 50 cents' lyrics and put him in a suit. No substance, lots of style. Nothing to see here. Please move along."
5,WOW!!!,"WOW, What more can be said about such a remarkable indivisual such as cece?Cece has never seased to amaze us all. Unlike previous albums, cece has been able to create a diverse album that has been able to capture believers and non believers alike. To often, christians sit back and say, "" Here is another artist, simply trying to find her groove with the secular world!"" But isn't that what we as christians are suppose to do. Is it not our job to reach out to non believers and pull them into the holy relm that our lord and savior has created for us to live? Cece has done just that. By reaching out and grasping the pop, r&b, contemporary christian and gospel sounds, cece has made an outstanding effort to appeal once more to christains and nonbelievers alike. And has done a Remarkable job at that!God Bless"
2,Mostly flash,I found the book to be very simple patterns with expensive and flashy yarns. Nor did I find that there was much variety in a book that costs this much. If the process of knitting is what you enjoy this book is not for you.
1,Very Disappointed,"This one is way overpriced for the lack-luster designs that were in there. I could not even find one sweater in the entire book that I would even think about knitting, much less wearing. I felt that the author was more interested in promoting her store than ""Simply Beautiful Sweaters"" because the only enticing photos I saw were the shelves full of yarn, not even ONE beautiful sweater. One of the worst books I've ever bought for knitting. Caveat Emptor"
2,You can live without it,"This book is very pretty and the yarns are superb and expensive, but most of the sweaters are pretty useless. There are too many bulky cropped thingies and patterns that call for all sorts of hard to find novelty yarns. The other thing which irks me is the insistence on peculiar needle sizes, for example, what the heck is a 10 3/4 size needle, and why cant you simplt use a 10 1/2?Also, there is a sweator in a picture of the store that looks great but.....it's not in the book!I bought this in a friends yarn shop as a favor and I have not knit one thing from it."
5,Inspired and enjoyable knitting,"With a lifetime of creating, designing,and knitting hundreds of garments for both personal and professional customers...I found this book a pleasure to read and use.There are many helpful hints to guide both novice and advanced knitters through their projects to a sucessful end. I excitedly await the release of the upcoming Simply Beautiful Sweaters for Men.What a great idea for a sequel!"
5,"finally, inspiration for the younger and hipper beginner","As a woman under 31 who started knitting last year, I *devoured* this beautiful collection of colorful but simple sweaters that didn't remind me of my grandmother. I am grateful that the authors took the time to collect patterns that are attractive (not stodgy!) but accessible to the beginner. Finally I have a book I want to show my friends who ask why and what I knit (sorry, but most of the more popular publications -- not Vogue Knitting or Rowan -- look like absolute death to the young(er) and hip(per)).I should note also that this book is behind my decision to invest in *really* nice yarns whenever I can. Even a simple pattern will showcase a great yarn (and vice versa). Besides, my time and the recipients of the sweater (me included) are worth the extra expense."
5,Hope it helps!,I'm hoping this will help me with the fit and in changing patterns. It looks like it has detailed instructions.
3,It's all in the yarn,"I bought this book because of its beautiful cover and, at first glance, the sweaters within it are quite exciting. As an intermediate/advanced knitter I felt a little cheated after more careful reading of the patterns because the beauty of many of the sweaters comes almost exclusively from the sumptious yarns used to knit them, not from the designs themselves. These patterns are rather basic and within the scope of an advanced beginner willing to invest in the listed yarns.This book does illustrate how simple designs can be made stunning with careful color and yarn selection."
4,Good for novice knitter or as a basic pattern reference,"When I first acquired this book last year I was a little underwhelmed by the simple patterns and the pricey yarns specified. However I appreciate it more, now that I am in a ""knit it quick"" phase. Also it is easy enough to substitute other yarns and gauges since the instructions do provide you with total yarn yardage required and the best schematic diagrams that I've encountered detailing at a glance where the decreases, increases and bind offs occur as well as the measurements of the sweater pieces. So if you're new to knitting or coming back after a long absence or want a set of basic patterns with nice armhole and neckline shaping, take a look at this book."
1,Do not buy this book,"This SAT is obsolete and the book is of little help to any student. The book was last published in 2006 and did not mention the fact that SAT has changed the year before. Someone gave it to me as it had a CD thinking it might be of some help in educating students but the REA software is very basic and does not include features that are the must. Moreover, some correct answers are missing so it is impossible to get a perfect score."
1,Very disappointed little girl,"our daughter saved for months to buy her self this electric scooter. she took very good care of it, and a week and a half after she rcvd. it the moter or something froze up. we now need to take it to Middleton where I am told they will fix it for free, but who has the time to run out to where ever Middleton is. So she loved it for a weekand a half and has been without since about the second week in august."
1,Ours was broken.,The one we got was broken. The headset was too tight. The Brakes were to tight. The chain locked up so it couldn't move. I hope this was an isolated incident.
5,Loads of fun and easy to operate,"My 7 year old really wanted the mod scooter, but the age for it said 12 and up... so Santa brought her this scooter. She also has a 10 year old sister who didn't want one, but Santa brought her one anyhow. We have only gotten to use them twice due to snow.... but they were a HUGE HIT! They are just the right size for BOTH kids... the mod would have been much too big and too fast and the battery life lasted very long. Says 40 min... they played with them for 3 hours with only a few very short breaks for a drink or something before they lost power. Well worth the small price tag. Also, Amazon ships it wonderfully... the box was covered(so they couldnt' see what it was) and was completely intact, no damage at all. The scooter is very easy to put together and charge. Great purchase!!"
5,Love it!,"We are very happy with this electric scooter! It is solid, sturdy and of great quality. Our 8 year old got it for Christmas and can't stop riding it. It is just as it says it is, and we could not be more pleased with it!"
4,Fun scooter for kids,"I got this scooter for my two girls--10 and 14. It seems more suited to the 10-year-old, but they both enjoyed it. It goes pretty fast, but not too fast. It needs to be charged each night after a full day's worth of play, but worth the money."
4,razor scooter review,"Great little scooter...not too fast for the little kids. Strong enough for hills, holds lots of weight, stays charged for a long time...everything it said it was. Only drawback is the chain guard scrapes when turning...we just took it off."
1,"Crappy product, 2nd time around","This is very diffcult to write because I bought one 6 months earlier that works fine til this very day. The second escooter is identical to the first except, the charger broke on the 4th day, the battery doesn't run as long as the original scooter, and RAZOR, USA is passing the buck to Amazon in order to have it replaced. I would highly recommend this scooter because my daughters love (the first one) but the second one happens to be a lemon, so good luck."
1,failed to start every time,I purchased a Razor model 100 and charged it fully. Sometimes the motor would start and sometimes it wouldn't. I returned it to Amazon and purchased two Razor scooters model 175 and they have worked flawlessly.
5,one happy 7 year old!!!,"My son wanted one of these motor scooters for his birthday but I didnt want to spend [...] This was the perfect price, perfect color (blue) and perfect gift. He still has a smile on his face."
1,Worked for exactly one day!!,"We boutght this for my son's 8th Birthday. He weighs 55 lbs. The product worked for one day, about an hour and half of riding. My son rode the product around our caldusac while I watched, my point is there was no funny business or abuse. When he went to use it the next day it was making a clicking sound when the engine engaged. I took the chain guard off and tried a couple quick fixes using the trouble shooting guide. I could not get it to stop clicking and the battery would not last more than 10 minutes, I assume due to whatever was causing the clicking. Granted I did not call their customer service, but quite frankly I'm tired of junk products that don't work and then I am supposed to waste an afternoon on the phone trouble shooting the product."
1,do not buy the razor E100,"We have purchased the e200, e300 and the e100. Do yourself a favor and do not buy the Razor E100, get the 200 or the 300. Razor.com customer service will not really help and the experience will get even worst that dealing with the e100 scooter. I hope this helps"
4,Electric Scooter,My mother bought this for my son for his last birthday. He is six and I was afraid of him getting hurt while riding it. It is well made but it does not stay charged for very long.
4,Great Scooter,"My daughter loves this scooter. I wish the wheels were bigger in order to make it a little higher off the ground though because the metal rubs everytime she tries to drive up the curb to get back on the sidewalk. Also, it was delivered in its original box (no box covering the product box) so the ""Easter Surprise"" turned out to be not such a surprise after all!"
2,"Starts off at max speed of 10 mph, dangerous","This item is different than the e-200 and the e-300, in that it needs the operator to manually get the scooter going to a specific speed while holding the throttle to the max. Then when it engages, boom, in takes off like it was shot out of a cannon at its max speed of 10mph. There is no gradual slower to faster speed increase like the other two models when starting out This is dangerous for new or inexperienced riders. Be careful, very dangerous. If you are concerned about this problem, get the e-200, much better product."
1,This one works good.,"I bought this (and a pink one) as Christmas gifts for my kids, but after receiving them, only one worked. So it was just as if I never bought one of my children a gift because it doesn't work, even after 18+ hours of charging. We checked all the wires and battery connections and everything, still nothing. this one actually worked really well after the intial charge but my daughter is upset that hers didn't work. I contacted Amazon concerning this issue, and within less than 24hours i had a response, and a promise of a refund. I would probably recommend these to someone, although I still wish I had a working one for my daughter."
4,Good product...poor quality control,"I ordered two of these for my twin grandsons. One was perfect and he was happy out of his mind to have it. The other had a problem with the brakes rubbing against the tire. We sent it back to Amazon and they overnighted another one to us, which was great service. However, the replacement scooter was also bad. My son then went to a store to buy another one but opened the box before he actually bought it. This also had the same problem. He then opened another box and it was good, so he purchased it. My grandsons love it. It seems when it's good it's very, very good, but when it's bad it's horrid."
1,"Keep your receipt to RETURN it..worked for 10 minutes, then no juice!!!!","Bought this hoping it was going to be a four star electric scooter..turned out to be one star for all of ten minutes...Did everything to perfection...charged it up for 18 hours ...made sure the tires were at the right psi...set up was easy...but horrors, upon horrors...after testing it for ten minutes...the battery decided it just did not want to cooperate and now this is just a big heavy manual razor scooter. Do not get this if it is going to be a surprise Christmas gift for your favorite kid...it will break their heart...Sad to say...Wanted to give it five, it destroyed itself in ten minutes"
5,Great gift,"My granddaughter was thrilled with this scooter. While their brothers play baseball and soccer, little girls in our area take their scooters to the games and ride all over enjoying the fun much more than the game."
1,Broke quickly; repairs are expensive,"We bought this scooter for my son. It's certainly fun, but the front tire very quickly went flat, and repairing it will take tools you don't have. Our son tried fixing it, and buying lots of parts and lots of tools, and the final costs added up to almost the price of a new scooter."
3,Damaged,"I received product in awesome time,purchased for grandaughter,my family will be gone on vacation for x-mas, so her x-mas was yesterday 12/18.She loves the gift,however the scooter has some damage to it in the side a small dent & scratched paint job at the dent. I dont think it should effect how it works but dont know yet because the battery requires 18 hrs of charging. I will know by 4:30 pm today 12/19 because she will be on it the second she gets off school. I eagerly await the ph call, so I will update then. Hope its as fun as it looks because her eagerness to ride & the smiles when she opened it were worth millions to me. I also hope some kind of compensation can be made because it will break her heart if it does""nt work or she has to return it."
2,Ok at best...,"Had this for about a week before it just stopped working.It's an ok scooter, it feels flimsy but for a younger child that is about 100lbs or less it's probably fine. I rode this all of about 5 times and on the last time riding it going up a slight hill it just stopped working. Figured it was the batteries but it wasn't charged and nothing at all as far as response. I just returned it because trying to get this fixed would be more than what the thing costs...Speed is ok on this, not too fast but it's not a snails pace like some of the lower priced scooters are. Not really much torque on this thing...My advice spend the extra money and get a better quality scooter. I have the super elite 800 and it's leaps and bounds above this. Next time I will learn not to go cheap on stuff, because it's just that. Cheap."
4,"Great scooter, nicely priced and 10 year old LOVES it!!!","I bought this for my son's 10 year old bday and he was completely thrilled! He rides this thing all the time and the kids in the neighborhood have even gotten a couple. This is pretty safe as a 2 wheeling scooter. Plenty of room. Keeps a safe pace. I would definitely recommend this!!! 2 things that are disappointing: 1. charge doesn't last all day, lol. 2. the handlebars are NOT adjustable.But would still recommend!!!!"
1,Very disappointed,"My husband and I bought this item for our 7 year old daughter for Christmas of 2008. Obviously, she used it rarely up until about two months ago when the weather started getting nicer. We paid $109.00 for this product and I believe the battery life should certainly last longer. My husband just tried charging it again for her to use and it completely is dead. And of course Amazon's return policy I had until January 31, 2009. I'm just tired of spending money on items and not having any quality in return. We are very disappointed as is my 7 year old."
4,7-yr old son enjoys everything but the recharge time.,My seven-year old son greatly enjoys riding this scooter. Everything is good except for the recharge time. We have to leave it up to charge the entire nite.
2,Razor E100 Electric Scooter,"I got this for my son and he rode it non-stop for 2 days before it broke. The motor would not engage, so I called Razor and they sent me a replacement part. After a week of waiting and 2 hours on the phone with tech support, I installed a complete new electrical system. Turned it on, still did not work! Razor said they could send me another part to install myself, but did not guarantee that it would make it work either. So, I decided to save the time and trouble and returned it for a non-electric kid powered scooter and we are much happier with it. For us, the electric version was way too much time and trouble."
3,Cool Scooter,"My ten year old son got this scooter for Christmas 2009 and he loves it. He takes it to Grandma's house, I walk and he rides the scooter to the corner store. It goes perfect speed for someone his age. Although I havent had this product long I havent had any problems so far."
5,Great Scooter!,"Santa brought this for our 8-year-old son - it was a big hit. He loves to motor around on it. When he takes a break, his mom (me) has been known to ""steal"" it for a moment or two. It's really a great little scooter and lots of fun! The battery seems to last a long time (we've never had it run out yet, but being winter and cold, we've not spent really extended amounts of time on it)."
5,Love it!,"Bought this for my 6 year old son for Christmas. He loves it. I definately would suggest if you buy this get a helmet, knee pads and elbow pads. There have been a few times that he hasn't slowed down enough taking a turn and he has taken a tumble. That is totally my son though. Little dare devil. With the pads and helmet on I do feel comfortable just letting him go."
5,scooter,Came within 3 days and was just as ordered.My question to you is how to use the $30 that I was given for new account and first time user as well as signing up for your card
1,It's O.K.,"I am a 12 year old kid that's had this scooter for about 3 years. I use it about 2 times a day just up and down the block. I highly do NOT reccondmend it. It is great because the battery has not died yet and is very quiet. But, i waned to go to my community clubhouse which is about 5 blocks away and the battery died before i even was halfway there! I had to ride it like it was a regular scooter and by the time i got there, my leg was about to drop dead! It is great for fun and driving a few blocks away, but get the e300 which is a little more $$ but it is worth it! this one only goes 7 mph while the e300 goes 15 mph. plus, the e300's battery lasts ALOT longer. So, don't make your kid suffer with a cheap load of garbage. Get the e300 and get a smile that you wil never forget!"
3,Delivery = Epic Santa Fail,"All the neighborhood kids have these scooters so I know the product is decent. However, heads up if you are ordering this as a surprise/gift.I could not be more disappointed with Amazon for shipping this in the manufacturers box...with a big picture of the scooter and RAZOR SCOOTER in huge letters across it.This was my son's top Santa request and now it's ruined - even though I tried telling him it was shipped to us by mistake, etc., etc."
5,on behalf of my 6-7 year old,"this is the best thing he owns, other kids that live nearby own them and for this age this type of machine is over the top. He is used to a normal razor, so the transition was fast, hes working it like a pro. great job razor!"
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,my 8 year old saved up his own birthday money for this scooter. He only got to ride it 3 times before the on/off switch fell off. It was a pain to order the parts through the Razor company. I felt they should have accepted a return of such a poorly made product. Its been 2 months and it is not yet fixed!!! My son is sooo sad he hasn't been able to play with it!! I would not recommened this scooter to anyone.
1,Horrible scooter - never worked,We purchased this scooter for a birthday present. When it came out of the box it worked great. The next day it was charged but would not run. We contacted the manufacturer as instructed and they said they would send a part. One month later we received the wrong part. We are still waiting two months later for a replacement part to arrive. Horrible experience for my daughter. She loved it for the brief day she was able to ride it.My advice if you buy this thing - return it to Amazon within the 30 days if it doesn't work - otherwise you are screwed.
3,back tire blew out.,I purchased this item from here and it took three weeks to be delivered to our store. My children played with it for a month and enjoyed it. Then the back tire blew out. Razor states they have a 90 day warranty so I contacted them.
1,Waste of money.,Only worked one day after she got it for Christmas. Waste of time and money. Charged it before Christmas day. She rode it that afternoon. will not recharge or work at all now.
4,It's an electric scooter....,"My (just) 8 year old daughter picked this out of a catalog before christmas, Amazon had the better deal. Scooter works good, she can zip up and down the driveway for quite a while on a charge. Keep two things in mind 1) you have to start it rolling bewfore the motor kicks in (I think 3 mph), and 2) the trottle is a 2-way switch, all or nothing. Still, very manageable for my 8-year old and she really likes it."
3,RAZOR E100 Electric scooter.,"The scooter went very well for the first 35 minutes and then the hand accelerator broke. Since it was a Christmas gift to a ten-year old, it was hsrder to mmanage."
5,loved it but returned it,"let me start off by saying I did not purchase this item on amazon, I got it at walmart and my review is based on about 20 minutes of usage. I bought it for my 7 yr old nephew for christmas. Now I did love the scooter. it was great quality and very easy to assemble (just pop in the handle bar and tighten a few screws). Although the product details say the weight limit is 120 pounds my hunny, who weighs about 200 pounds, was able to ride it with no problem. it goes pretty fast. for my nephew the scooter was too fast. (my nephew is not very outdoorsee and is scared of anthing that poses a danger) maybe in a couple of years when my nephew is not so scared of its speed I think it will be perfect for him. I really did love it and so did my hunny, so much so the he plans to buy an e300."
3,battery was weak,"All was good, but the battery did not seem to have a great charge and died about a year later. Purchased and installed an aftermarket battery which lasts much longer and is much better. I am guessing I got a stale battery the first time around."
2,bummer on the shipping,The scooter is fine.The box (with all the nice graphics) was pretty beat up when we received it. It wasn't put in a box for shipping. It was a Christmas gift so it was kind of tacky looking when unwrapped. Bummer.
4,blue scooter,I brought it for my 7 year old nephew for his birthday. Amazon is the only one who carried a blue Razor scooter. He loved it and it works great.
4,Generally happy,"We bought the scooter for our 10 year old, and he seems to love it. His only complaint is that the scooter can scrap the ground when he makes a turn (the cover for the chain scrapes the ground)."
2,was hoping for better,"The Razor does not hold a charge! We charge it completely but when my daughter gets on and rides it, it only stays charged for about 30 minutes and she is well within the weight range suggested."
5,E100 Razor Scooter,This was the perfect gift for my 7 year old son. He loves it. It's easy to drive and only goes 10 mph which is perfect for him. I highly recommend this electric scooter. He's having a blast on it.
5,"Good value, good product, daughter loves it","Gave this to my daughter for Christmas 2007. It was easy to assemble, and we pre-charged it overnight prior to the big day. She absolutely loves it, and I have a feeling the neighborhood kids will be receiving these soon as well -- they line up to take turns.Great battery life, an overnight charge gives it enough power to go for an extended period of time -- usually a single charge will last all day assuming sporadic periods of riding.It goes up to 10MPH. I was initially concerned about my 7-year-old riding this in the name of safety, but after ten minutes she went from trepidation to mastery. Make sure your kids wear helmets, of course.No complaints, it's a great product (so far) for the price, highly recommended."
2,fun while it lasted,"I bought this for my 12 yr old son for Christmas and he had a lot of fun while it lasted. The throttle broke within the first week, giving him full speed or nothing. The only way to control the speed was with the brake. He wanted to keep it and put up with it. Now it doesn't work at all. Funny how it quit working right when the 90 warranty was up."
2,Better to spend a little extra....,It was a hit when it was opened as a gift but lost it's luster soon thereafter. It was purchased for a 12 year old. It doesn't hold a charge very long at all. As for speed...I'm pretty sure my 3 year old can keep up with his toy story $10.00 scooter. It has sat in the garage. I was being extra frugal - if you can get the next one up - it would be worth an extra $20 or so to do it. Might be good for a much younger child.
2,"Great Product, but Amazon shipped Used Damaged Scooter","I ordered two of these scooters for my sons in November for their big gift from the man in red. They arrived promptly and we stored them out of sight until Christmas. BIG MISTAKE. When my father went to put them together Christmas eve and charge them up, one was in perfect, new condition. The other one was obviously used. The tags were still on it but the foot board had a huge scratch, the kickstand was broken and the wheels were dirty. We plugged the battery in just to see and sure enough, it was already charged. I will never again wait until the last minute to make sure that Amazon didn't ship me a USED and Broken products.As for the scooter that was new, it is fantastic! My sons are 8 and just love it. They just don't like having to share while Mom has to ship back the broken gift. And I dont like having to explain why Santa sent them a broken gift. Shame on you Amazon."
4,Easy to assemble,This product was bought for our daughtershe absolutely loved itwill have hours of fun
2,Ship it to another location if its a surprise!,"I would have wanted to know that Amazon sends this with its box contents completely exposed on the outter box. DO NOT have it sent to your home if its a Christmas gift! (Especially if its a Santa gift :( ) I am very dissapointed in the delivery method of this item and hopefully the product will be something I am satisfied with once the girls start using it. We are still going to wait to give until Christmas morning, there went the morning magical surprise :("
4,Great scooter - never mind the packaging,"This was a much longed for gift from Santa. Unfortunately it arrived by delivery truck in its OUTER packaging and my 8 year old heard the 'thud' of the package, came running in shouting 'Mommy we have an electric scooter'. So much for Santa's gift. Stupid decision by Amazon not to deliver all gifts around December in anonymous brown packaging? Otherwise, great scooter my kids love it."
5,Amazing Product,"This product is amazing!. I am 12 and weigh 81 pounds. I rode it for 3.5 hours straight. It is amazing battery power. I think ten miles per hour is a lot even though you can get 15 miles per hour it is still pretty fast. I rate it 5 stars because it is fun, educational, and yet, long lasting. Thank you Razor!"
4,Holding up well - nephew loved it!,"Bought this for my nephew who just turned 6. - I was concerned with it beinig too fast, it's just right. he transitioned from push version to this in seconds!Quality so far seems great, only area that could be better is the chain guard. - if he takes corners a little too tight, the guard gets scratched on the pavement. - Rear wheels should be a little bigger.Otherwise, worth the $"
1,looks cool but poor quality,Bought this scooter for my 8 yr old sons b-day. He only weighs 53 lbs. and the scooter has fried 2 motors within less than 2 weeks. good thing i bought the extened warranty on this... i am going to take this scooter back and upgrade to a scooter with bigger tires and hope this will take care of our problem of the belts being chewed up and the gears going out...he also has not abused this scooter in anyway. I think it is poor quality on the manufactures part. He absolutely loves the scooter but we cant keep the problems from happening to it. if you are thinking of buying a scooter i suggest that spend a little more money and go to a better scooter AND DONT FORGET THE EXENDED WARRENTY!!!!
5,Scooter Mania,"My son purchased this scooter with his own money that he saved up. We live in a cul d' sac and he just turned seven. He wanted a scooter for himself after his sister got the same model for Christmas. They really enjoy the product and it is a big hit with their friends. This unit does not have the power of the more costly scooters, but that is what we like about it.The battery lasts about 45 minutes and since it is winter, this seems just the amount of time that it holds their interest. The real test will be in good weather when the entire day is available for play.I recommend this unit if your kids have a more quiet nature. Probably should go with the higher models if you live in an area with lots of wild kids or if they engage in intense play that causes them to be hard on toys."
4,great,"came quickly in the mail. the chain guard broke off very quickly though, within a few days. but i think it was because my daughter was using it to go from a sidewalk onto the road or vice versus. if there is any little bump at all the bottom of the scooter and the chain guard could hit the road and break off."
1,too weak,"this is a electric scooter, it has barely any power, my kid only weighs 65 lbs, you got to be kidding, its not for a kid, a skateboard goes much quicker, child very unhappy as i am also,not worth the money paid"
2,Motor broken after 6 months,"We ordered this scooter for our 9 year old son. He used it off and on for about 6 months, then it stopped working. We took it to a local battery store. They told us there was no problem with the battery, but with the motor. We cannot repair it, but we will try and contact the company and see if they'll send us a new scooter."
1,Very Disappointed,I brought this scooter for my 8 year old daughter as a Christmas gift. Now that its nice out we planned on taking it out and she rides it while I run around the track. It worked the very first time we took it out but battery died quick. My daughter placed the scooter on the charger and the next day we went to the park and it would not work at all. I thought maybe it didnt charge all the way so I placed it back on the charger. We took the scooter to the park a couple of days later and tried riding it for the third time and it still did not work. I am very disappointed and she is upset that she doesnt have a working scooter.
1,Blue Razor review,"Horribly dissatisfied with Razor and Amazon. The Electric scooter is not working and after weeks of trying to work with Razor (Amazon sadly refused to help from the onset of this issue ) we still do not have this problem resolved!! From this point forward, I will never buy anything that has the possibility of breaking down from Amazon. Its back to the Big Box Stores for me."
5,Love it!,"Great toy - I have 3 boys ages 6, 9 and 11 - all 3 love this scooter. I was hesitant to get it for my six year old - but he was careful. They have to get it up to a decent speed before the motor will kick in. The charge holds fine - easy to charge and holds up well. I do worry they can't hear cars well when the motor is on (not terribly loud - but louder than a bike!). Watch for sales - sometimes different colors are different prices. Well worth the money - great gift"
2,Battery died in 5 months,I would recommend to get this kind of product from Toys R Us store as supposed to online since they give you the option to get a $10 of 2 year warranty. I ordered this scooter from amazon for Christmas and around 5 month later the battery died and it's done; now I'll have to get the battery and fix it.The scooter is great except for the battery it didn't last long.
1,WAIST OF MONEY,"THIS SCOOTER WAS A PIECE OF S*** .. WILL NEVER BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN , AND WILL NEVER SUGGEST NO ONE TO BUY SOMETHING FROM HERE EITHER !!!!"
2,Electric Razor scooter,"My dauther liked the scooter, until she fell off of it and got hurt pretty badly. I would recommend caution to other parents buying this."
4,misled,I bought a razor 100 believing that the handlebars were adjustable or were telescoping. I believed this from the pictures and vidoes I viewed on the listing and product information for the e-100 scooter at Amazon.com. There was even a detailed feature diagram on the adverstisement indicating the adjust lever for the telescoping handlebars. When I recieved the scooter the handle bars were not telescopic as I was led to believe. So beware that you might not be getting the scooter with the features you thought it would have.The plus side to this was when I contacted amazon.com they were cooperative and handled the situation with several options for rectification for me to choose from. Their customer service was easy and efficient.
2,Razor Scooter Purchase,"I paid for my purchase to have expedited shipping. However, the item was not shipped until the day it should have arrived at it's destination. When the scooter arrive the battery would not hold a charge. We have been the last 2 weeks trying to get a replacement battery from the company. Next time I will purchase locally and ship myself."
4,age appropriate,This item was bought for an 8 year old boy. Perfect speed for this age. HE was histactic when he opened it!
1,E- 100 Razor Scooter,"It is Jan. 7, 2012 and the E-100 razor scooter I bought for my granddaughter is still in the shop. the scooter arrived promptly and the package was in good shape. I gave it to her 10 days before Christmas so that she could enjoy it for the holidays, 3 days later it stopped working and was shocked to find out that i had no recourse for return. my only option was to send it to the shop and there it sits waiting for parts. I will never buy anything electronic from amazon again!"
5,Best Present Ever,Purchase this item for my 9 year old grandson. I was a bit apprehensive as I thought he was too young for it. Was I ever wrong. It is the best present ever and he is having a great time playing on it.
4,scooterride...,"this is a great ride and i enjoy with my daughter and i recommend people to have fun and have one and alway charge the battery before going out and parents should test it the scooter before going out and is fun to travel to get to places,but always wear the helment is the law."
5,Excellent Romantic suspense!,This is my first time reading this writer and I must say I was wonderfully surprised and impressed. It was a well written romance and a true who done it. I loved it and I am planning to get back copies of this writer earlier writings.
3,Good Side Trek for the Lost Caverns,"This module suffers from being basically an extended random encounter for the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth. Given that, it's a very GOOD addition to that adventure. However, it lacks good art (actually, it almost lacks art, period) and doesn't have enough ""personality"" to make it a great module. In essence, this is a ""hack'n'slash"" adventure that is something of a war of attrition with humanoids that have set up housekeeping in a temple to an imprisoned evil power. It has the beginnings of some great atmosphere, but ultimately lacks luster. Get it if you have the Lost Caverns; then it is imbued with the added depth it sorely needs."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The picture for this product is for the ""deluxe"" version which I purchased at Target. I ordered this one so I could keep one upstairs and downstairs to avoid potty emergencies. This is not the deluxe version... it isn't as cushiony and the opening is a little larger. It slides around on our toilet seat where the other one does not. Not a big deal for the price but my 22mo old daughter did notice and always asks for ""the other one"""
1,Don't bother!!!,This seat is terrible. We were looking for something softer than the baby bjorn seat. We got it but what a mess. The seat moved around constantly and it leaked all over the toilet seat everytime my son used it. Save your money and try something else.
3,series wears thin with the final volume,"Considering most of this series focused on Hi-NRG tracks from the 80s, this volume seems to scrape the bottom of the barrel, even digging into some more house and rave oriented tracks of the early 90s, which could have been a separate series in itself. Even so, you are likely to find some hard-to-find stuff you've been wanting on CD for a long time. Track times are:1. love pains (7:46)2. no use to borrow (6:27)3. something tells me (7:40)4. i'll be around (6:05)5. love fire(5:35)6. love hangover (5:33)7. magic's in the air (6:34)8. set me free (6:00)9. lover why (7:15)10. what would I do (4:07)11. abracadabra (6:08)12. dance your way out the door (7:11)"
3,It's Only OK,"On this Cd ""Over & Out, my favorite songs would be ""Something Tells Me"" & ""No Use To Borrow"". ""Love Pains"" is also very good but I only wish that it was the version by Hazell Dean from the 1989 & esp. 1990 time frame. ""Set me Free"" seems pretty good, too. There are a couple of Remakes here but otherwise, I wasn't too familiar with some of these songs. I can only rate as OK with only 3 stars."
2,Artist please...!,"What would have been helpful to me in deciding on this cd is the artist(s). I agree with ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"" with the exception of Love Pains.1. Love Pains - Yvonne Elliman2. No Use To Borrow - Blue Moderne3. Something Tells Me - Tiger Moon4. I'll Be Around - Terri Wells5. Love Fire - Syreeta6. Love Hangover - The Fifth Dimension7. Magic's In The Air - Jake Jacas8. Set Me Free - Richy9. Lover Why! - Dee Martin10. What Would We Do - D.S.K.11. Abracadabra - Feel Real12. Dance Your Way Out The Door - Sharon Dee Clarke"
3,Okay,"Raygun always came across a lot better and more agressive live. The same holds for The Bomb. Indecision is worth buying, but only to get a feel for their songs before seeing a show. The album is okay, but only a slight progression from the last of Raygun's stuff. In fact, you can really hear how Pezzati must have taken over NR towards the end by listening to this album in comparison."
4,Good Comeback,"This sophomore release from Perfect Stranger is a nice comeback. It's been a little while since the first album and I think this one is really good. The title track, ""The Hits"", is great. It pays tribute to some other songs that have made it big. Pick this one up. You won't be disappointed. It's got an awesome country flavor. I think Steve Murray has one of the best voices in country music."
5,Great Music,This is another CD I chose for one song and got surprised when I found out I liked most all of the songs on the CD. This is a good group.
3,So So,"50's usually hit or miss with the G-Unit Radio Mixtapes, and this one is on the lower end of the spectrum. I Got Hoes and Girl Gimme Your Number are hot, and ther are like, three or four hhard hitters, but the tape before this is better. Hot Rod still hasn;t proven himself on this tape. Buy only if your a G-Unit collector or you've got extra $. Why pay 10 bucks here if you can get it for six or seven at mixtapeusa.com? I think they have package deals, too- five for 20 or something like that. Any of the the first eight G-Unit mixtapes is a sure shot banga."
1,The real mystery is how this book got published!,"I am not a follower of the Oak Island mystery, just someone who read an interesting article in Rolling Stone about the mystery and then went in search of more detail. This book is badly written, confusing and overly presumptive. Do not buy!"
1,not very good,"As a fan of The Oak Island Mystery, I book this book on the spot. When the authors talk about Oak Island, the book moves along. But, when they start going off on their own theories, you seem to get lost easily. Their claim "" ...have finally solved the sinister riddle of Oak Island...."" is the farthest thing from the truth. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."
5,As good as it gets...,"Two Mix has outdone themselves. A great mix of fast paced techno songs, along with some slower songs for good measure, this 2 cd set is the holy grail of Japanese Music. If you like japanese music, techno, or a great party CD, buy it. It may be spendy, but its worth every darn penny"
5,Thank you,"I have been searching for Qbert on pc for quite awhile, it has to be one of my all time favorite classic games along with Galaga and tetris to play... You couldn't tear me away from these games when I was a kid and I don't expect I'll spend a ton of time on the net now that I have this. Thank you.I am very pleased with the shipping, delivery and product experience. I love my new game.The packaging was perfect,the game in excellent condition. I would certainly recommend this product and this company to anyone who will listen. And yes, I'd buy from this seller again."
3,"Good, but Repackaged Material","This DVD is, as others have noted, a compilation of segments from Shiva Rea's prior core workouts, two of which I already own. While it's nice to not have to change DVDs to do multiple segments, I doubt I would have purchased this had I known there was no new material.I have no issues with the workouts themselves; they are great, as most of Shiva's stuff is. However, I do take issue with what I think is misleading packaging that never indicates that this is old material in a new DVD."
2,Disappointed,"This DVD is too improvisatory for my taste - there is too little actual direction and instruction. If I wanted to make up my own workout, I would not have paid for a DVD!"
5,Great book if considering Acceleration for your child,"If you are interested in acceleration (grade skipping) for gifted kids, you MUST own these books. BUT...don't buy them. If you search for ""A Nation Deceived"" and go to their website, they will send them to you for free. Or you can download your own copies immediately. I prefer holding a book, so I ordered the free copies. ( I copied this from another review) ** I received mine for free as well and fairly quickly.This book was a great book to read! I was able to use several of the quotes in the book as well as many facts it has in it. This book helped me feel more confident in my decesion to have my child accelerate to the 4th grade. I feel every school district gifted department should have one on file. I wish more teachers were up to speed on the research it provides.I have recommended this book to another local family going throuh similar issues with getting their child accelerated. They loved the book as well!"
5,Grateful for Amazon,The academic adviser for our school district suggested this study when we were contmeplating grade skipping for our daughter. It has been a great bonus that gave credence to some of our instincts and helped assuage our concerns on her future education.I am so glad that Amazon has eased the way that buyers.searchers of an out of print article/study can find a seller. I really wanted a copy of the study of my own and now I have it for a very reasonable cost. Thanks to everyone involved. It is complete and does not seem to have any defects at all!
2,"So-so headphones, bottom-of-the-barrel microphone.","I recently purchased the Telex H551 to test it for use in a language-lab setting, where students are expected to record their voices for playback by the instructor. We're currently using [price]Plantronics headsets with foam earpieces and bead microphones. The Telex didn't even come close to the sound quality of the Plantronics (which isn't terrific). At [price] per unit, Telex ought to be ashamed of referring to this headset as suitable for voice-recognition, internet telephony, or any other function involving use of the headset mike. On the plus side, the headphones produce reasonable fidelity when playing back audio CDs or MP3s. Perhaps the microphone was an afterthought ..."
3,Problems in all OS-es,"I tried it in Linux, Windows 98 and Windows XP. It has problemsin all of them. In Linux - microphone does not work. In WindowsI do not rememeber as I think Windows stinks and I rarely use them.The headphones are kind of alrge and heavy but some people may like it. The microphone is mounted in an inconvienient way- leg is not flexible and I cannot have it at left or right side.The nice thing is that the unit has standard jack connectorsand headset is connected with them so you may use headset withstandard audio card or use standard headphones with this USBmodules. This is the only thing which I liked more in thisone than in Labtex Axis 712.Generally my suggestion is that if price is not very different - Labtec Axis 712 is a better choice - especially since it works great with Linux in full-duplex (great for notebooks) but also because it is lighterand that the microphone is better and more flexible."
1,unbelievably bad,"this is one of the absolute worst things i've ever heard. anyone who claims that this rocks has never heard true rock music, and the one comparison to tool is the most inane and misleading comparison i've ever heard, rivaled only by the sheer idiocy of the nirvana comparison. this band couldn't possibly compare with either of those bands. idiotic juvenile lyrics, crappy derivative music....it just sucks, pretty much. i literally broke my copy, i hated it so much."
5,What happen to this band? They're Great!!!!!!,"I resently bought this album thinking that it would suck, but when I listen to it, I got blowed away! The melodys and lyrics are brillant. I can see why A Perfect Circle's Marynard James Keenan redid one of there songs, ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"".This album should be talked about for a long time! Great!!!"
4,Failure's Masterpiece,"Ken Andrew's last escapade with Failure. This CD is a drawn out masterpiece almost perfectly melded together by the instrumental songs. If for nothing else it's Failure's best CD because it's also their longest. Also, if you like Failure you should check out Doves... they are rather similar...Rug burn out...."
2,Still flyin' the flannel...,"I'm afraid Failure's Fantastic Planet comes off primarily as a third tier grunge knockoff band (at best) with requisite big guitar choruses and lyrics about such interesting subjects as girls 'n stuff. Well, to be fair they're not completely boring. Every once in a while they do something unique or musically interesting although sometimes that uniqueness is uniquely irritating: see the song ""Blank"". Occasionally the lyrics are worth listening too, most often tho I just don't care. If a band that distills its sonics from Nirvana, Sonic Youth and a little bit of Polvo, only without the imagination or emotional impact is your thing, then by all means have at it, otherwise file it under ""meh"". Thank god alternative rock is dead."
5,Boom!!! Here it is!!!,"I found this album amidst a stack of CDs in the basement of a college radio station in Central Illinois. The station overlords had a practice of affixing post-it notes to the CD covers, documenting their curt peremptory dictates on whether the contents were suitable for wider (but yet still ridiculously limited) consumption. The post-it note on Failure's ""Fantastic Planet"" read simply, ""Boom!!! Here it is!!!"" (this was 1997 and people still talked like that in 1997). I think that got the point across rather well - certainly much better than that piece of hideous hyperanalysis at allmusic dot com. ""Fantastic Planet"" sits proudly alongside the likes of Radiohead's ""O.K. Computer"" as one of the select few truly innovative, truly coherent, truly accomplished albums of the '90s. It is the kind of masterpiece that comes along every once in so very long. You remain ignorant of it at your own peril."
3,Best when brooding,"Failure's third and final attempt not to be one was another successfully underground attempt to further breed their slickly distorted, hard-rock depressants into an even catchier, and sometimes friendlier sound, with mixed results. With a name like theirs, it needn't be said that the group works best in a negative melodic musical context, and songs to the contrary, while still mainly competent and even mildly infectious, do not serve Failure's strength."
5,Fantastic is right...,"For me this CD was a real sleeper. I heard 'Stuck On You' years ago, and strictly limited that song to MP3...was that a mistake. I decided to give the entire CD a chance based off that one song, and it paid off big. This CD his a hidden treasure to those who haven't heard it before. Tracks like Smoking Umbrella and Pillowhead soon became those catchy songs that get stuck in your head. A very musically tight CD, and a great addition to your collection if you like this type of music."
5,Fantastic Record,"Quite possibly the 2nd best disc in history (the 1st being TOOL's 'Aenima'). The 3rd record from FAILURE is their most accomplished, however their previous CDs are worth it as well. This disc rocks. This disc really rocks. A superb alternative construction of hooks, riffs, and melody that will find it's way into your CD player over and over. The extremely talented members of this band have moved on to the following projects; On, Autolux, Blinker the Star, and Year of the Rabbit. All of which are what good music is suppose to sound like. A must own for anyone serious about modern rock."
4,Good case,"Good case which provides excellent protection. As previous reviews have stated, care does need to be taken to ensure the zip doesn't scratch your laptop."
5,"Marware Sportfolio Sleeve 15"" MacBook Pro Case Fits Like A (Body)Glove!","I am very impressed with the durability of the Marware Sportfolio Sleeve for my 15"" MacBook Pro, in addition to how its neoprene-like fabric perfectly fits around my notebook...reminds me in many ways of much smaller Body Glove-made cell phone casings that I've also bought from Amaazon.com before. In general, the Marware case is quite sporty looking with the blue-cloth striping in the middle and there is some great functionality that you get out of the pocket in the middle for stowing a mouse or other small devices.Overall, I'd have to say that I'd heartily recommend this Marware case to any MacBook Pro owner who is looking to protect their investment and also to have a slick looking case bag. Very nice to see that a company like Marware still puts a lot of quality and consideration into their product line! They'll have to let me know if they come up with any other new MacBook Pro accessories in the future!"
3,"Works as it should, smells terrible","PRO:It does what it's supposed to do.CON:Maybe it's just mine, but it emits a unpleasant odor that I guess is just a characteristic of the material.My MacBook Pro and laptop bag now reek of the scent."
3,a little better than adequate,"This product fits the macbook pro, albeit a very tight fit that is sometimes difficult to zip up. once zipped, however, the computer is protected pretty well."
2,Mareware sleeve review,"Two out of the two zippers failed after about 4 months of use. The handles of the zipper broke off, and there was some fraying of the lining."
2,so far so good,"Fits snugly on a 15 inch macbook pro aluminum unibody (late 2008 model)No complaints.***Update*** Have owned this thing for 7 months. Both zipper handles have ripped off. Do not spend $25 on this thing, buy one from Hong Kong on ebay for $10, because it will break anyway."
1,no good - zipper broken,"got this and used for a few months, now zipper broken off (one end) and the other zipper is broken (fell from zip) it seems this is a poorly made product, will not want to buy again"
4,good condition,"This product is thinner than my imagination. However, it could give a good protection of my MacBook~"
5,Protect you MBP,"I got this case in order to protect my MBP of 15.4""It fits the laptop as a glove, not too tight and not too loose to move.I got this case to protect my laptop from wearing off, or scratch it, when I put it in to my backpack laptop compartment and to transport it by hand when in the office.I fully recommend this item, for the excellent quality, the design is also great, I haven't use the kangaroo bag that has in the middle, it will hold an ipod or the remote controller for front row on the MBP."
5,Bill's best,"IMO, this is probably Bill's funniest CD.....classic.....I've heard it 100's of times and always get a ton of belly laughs. Bill Engvall is comic genious."
4,Darn funny even for non-texan listeners,"First of, I am not Texan, I'm not even American. Means, english is not my native tongue and I admit it had some little problems understanding Bill. But I tell you what, It's so funny. All his jokes from daily life, bizarr stories about golfin' and his son's I.G. Joes.... too funny.It's really a cool CD"
5,Hillarious,The tape was a gift and enjoyed by all. It is tremendously funny and I will purchase all of his tapes and/or CD's. Quite a talent. Would like to know where and when he is performing.
3,Not as funny anymore,"I loved Bill Engvall when he first came out but I think he's lost his touch or maybe his humor is one that just gets old after a while. If you really like Engvall, you might like it. I didn't find myself laughing out loud very often. It's kind of boring, actually."
4,Very different,"I enjoyed Bill Engvall, however I find his new album Dorkfish to be much better. He's got to be the only comedian to go into detail about sex without swearing at all, and at points on the album a little obscenity would've been better off (just a couple areas), plus his take on lack of disipline on children offended me. Still it's worth it."
1,Irresponsible and outdated.,"Mr. Trimpey has simply taken existing methods, put a twist on them and repackaged them. Current peer reviewed literature supports motivational interviewing, stages of change and CBT (to name a few techniques) to treat alcohol misuse. Mr. Trimpey dismisses terms like trigger and enabler as ""jargon"" then encourages a person to think about their drinking...essentially to consider the very things he dismisses. It is not from a strengths based perspective which is odd. The imagery and labels he uses are very negative and deficit focused (there's a part of your mind he calls ""the beast""). Last but not least he should lose whatever professional license he has for claiming to ""cure"" substance abuse. He thinks he can stand on the work of others and basically give it paint job and resell it. Very irresponsible. Drug addiction is a twofold challenge involving a person's physical and mental being."
1,"This book is okay for ""hard drinkers.""","This book is okay if you are a hard drinker or problem drinker as defined by the big book of AA. There are a lot of people in AA who are not ""real alcoholics."" These people will be helped by this book. If you are of the hopeless variety then I would suggest AA. There are too many people who don't understand that AA is the world's biggest social movement of the 20th century. AA can help the real alcoholic. So please find out if you are the real thing or if you are just a problem drinker. Your life might depend upon it."
1,Borrow a copy of this book. Don't buy it! Then compare!,I only wish to point out 4 points. 1. AA has no opinion on this book! It doesn't try to advance by tearing down others! It doesn't have to. 2. Truth is always offered without financial profit to anyone. 3. Truth does not have to be promoted in anyway! 4. The program of Alcoholics Anonymous is only for those who want it and only for those who suffer from Alcoholism.
1,Moralistic BS of the worst kind,"""Rational Recovery"" is about the most irrational way to look at ""addiction"" possible. What is called addiction is a problem with the brain. Many if not most ""addicts"" are simply replacing chemicals in their brains that their genes do not make in sufficient quanities and/or trying escape from painful memories (for example, 70 percent of female heroin addicts were sexually abused BEFORE they ever used heroin or other drugs). For anyone with an ounce of understanding of genetics, psychology, or neurobiology, and a trace of compassion, the ideas in ""Rational Recovery"" are nothing more than cruelty, backwards moralism, and plain ignorance."
4,Expose,This is an EXCELLENT book and scathing critique of Alcoholics Anonymous. AA IS taking over society and Jack does well exposing it. He forgot to add that AA was also behind the war in Iraq and it has come to my attention that AA was largely the guiding force behind Tommy Hilfiger's 2003 runway collection.
3,"Better than AA, but still not for me.","I read this book at the same time I read AA's Big Book--about ten years ago. Neither one made any sense to me then or now. AA's powerlessness and Higher Power notions are absurd and were ultimately unhelpful to me, but I find the whole notion of the Beast simplistic and, well, just odd somehow.Also, although I am certainly not a fan of 12 step, I don't think it was necessary for Mr. Trimpey to devote so much paper to his criticism of AA. I totally agree with everything he says about it--it's all true--but this book is supposed to be about how to get healthy, not about what a crock AA is. Even though it is.For those who don't care for AA and who find the kernel of Trimpey's ideas compelling, I recommend SMART Recovery, which is based on Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) model. While apparently Albert Ellis himself was not blessed with a pleasing personality, REBT itself makes sense."
4,incredible results so far,"I have only read about 60 % of this book, but so far I havent had a drink in 3 months.That is the best Ive done in 10 yrs my life is changeing for the better every day. I must comment on how I look at everything now,a very positive attitude.Thanks Jack Ill write again when Im done."
4,AA Needs an Alternative,"Recovery needs a alternative to the religious fundamentals of 12-step programs. Faith-based recovery works for some and not for others.The 12 Steps has worked for many people and, therefore, cannot be ridiculed. But it is not the catch-all cure simply because it keeps alchohlics and addicts in a constant state of recovery. One can be ""recovered,"" and a normal life can be achieved.A ""diseased"" person can usually be cured, unless alcholohism or drug addiction is like AIDS or terminal cancer. I've known past alchoholics and addicts who have lived long and prosperous lives once their ""disease"" has been beaten."
5,Helpful,"I found this to be the type of book that I could skim, mark up some, and then go back to the parts that were helpful to me. I decided to write this review because it worked for me. Wow, did it ever work! Easily!"
3,Christmas Eve,"I have talked to the co-author of this book, Shirley Trimpey, several times on the phone. She is truly a wonderful and decent human being. It is Christmas Eve and I want to drink. I am a member of A.A. and I have used Jack's book. His book is intellectually sound. But I do wish I could go to a warm and wonderful A.A. meeting with some of those wonderful 12-steppers I have known. Shirley said to me, ""Why not just go out with friends?"" It's just not the same thing. And will never be. I have a friend who is following both AA and soon RR. Whatever gets you through. A wonderful book, of course. Just keep the Big Blue Book handy. Merry Christmas. I'm going out and buy ice cream and root beer."
1,Very Misleading,"After having read this book through I made up my mind to quit for good,it's been about 4 months and I've started over 5 times now, so I thought I might be better off getting some support after all,I'm sure this book helps some, but I guess I just don't have the willpower to just wish my drinking problem away."
1,""" The New Cure ?""","A more aproppriate name for this book would be "" Yet Another Tool "" the use of cognative therapy has been used to treat addictions for years with little success, theres nothing new here. as for the cure there is no permanent cure for alcoholismthis is just another tool to combat the cravings.it reminds me how years ago the first lady came on television, and said "" Just say no"" and how hestericaly funny it was to people who had tried this for years.If you drink a little too much, this may be the book for you, But if your Alcoholic, chances are that if you ever do get and STAY sober for any period of time it will be through Alcoholics Anonymous.currious about this authors motives? I was too, so I looked at his website.http://rational.org/I was shocked by the insanity of this man, and his few faithfull followers, buyer beware, remember nothing in life comes free, if you want sobriety, you may have to actually do some work for it."
4,You will be able to stop drinking by reading this book.,"The brain is organized into distinct parts. (Perhaps you have heard the left and right brain differences, for example.) We drink for pleasure, and the primitive mid-brain is the pleasure center, which seeks to engage the higher, thinking brain to satisfy this desire for pleasure. The rational brain (YOU) vows to never drink again, and takes control over the primitive pleasure center. You'll do this easily without any higher power or religion crap."
2,Not for everyone,"I am not a problem drinker but bought this book as an aide for me to learn and possibly help someone else in my life. I had been to AA meetings and definately approve of what works for them. I am neither for or against AA, but for anything that works and helps someone in their life. This book seemed very distant and uncaring about the life of an alcoholic. I am a very rational person and would just say ""hey, stop doing this to yourself"" if it was that easy, but it isn't. The alcoholic struggles with many emotional experiences and needs to find a way to curb those before he/she can just stop. Since I am not an alcoholic, I cannot say that this recovery method doesn't work, it might. But I got so put off with the author's negative image about AA, instead of focusing on how to fix the alcholic's problem, that I put the book down and haven't picked it up again."
3,Trash the competion,"Good book. Helpful ideas on substance abuse & how to end it,however too much energy put into trashing AA & other treatment options that could help people"
4,At last a self-help book that truly depends on Self!,This book gives hope. Puts solving problem directly on the only one able to solve it... The drinker. This shows the how and way but never takes the responsibility for either staying addicted or stopping from the person doing the drinking. It is rational!!
1,cheesy,Overall the production sounds cheesy like a casio keyboard.whoever produced this needs school. A waste of my download time dont buy it.
2,The war against Saddam Hussien,"The war against iraq was a fighting cause. Everyone in the U.S. disliked Saddam Hussien. He lost the war because of, the lac of food, water, exe. He never fed his troops, he only took care of him self, and then he lost the war. After the war about 8 years later we put a threat on him, tha we would bomb his citys, and we did. We blew up a bunch of civilian houses, killed a few people in iraq, inasent people, which was not right at all. We should of just sent the navy seals in to do the work, and alot of infantry troops. Yeah it may of took a long time, but atleast we will get the job done. Because we have the capability of taking charge of iraq."
5,A great help for the teaching of Earth Science !,"Not bad, should include a word key for the lower level kids. It keeps the students busy for a period. I've seen better, I've seen worse. This book will keep their interest up as a supplement to a normal classroom situation."
3,"Good, in some ways","It was a little hard getting through all 6 tapes. She is judgemental of other natural practices, such as meditation, when not conducted in the way she describes. Despite this, thet concepts she brings on emotions are interesting and detailed. She brings a perspective I had not considered and I did take away some valuable information.I would suggest committing to listening to whole series, even if some of the parts are not comfortable to listen to.There will be pieces you will gain from it."
2,Misleading title!,"Lab notebook itself has pretty good quality. The reason I ordered this lab notebook was because it said 200 sheets! but it only has 100 pages with 100 duplicates. It's not 200 pages. The title of this product is somewhat confusing and I could have bought something cheaper than this at local store if I knew there was only 100 pages. (Being a student, price does matter!)"
4,"Bought it, didn't use it.",Not much to say about it. It's a notebook. I needed it for a class in college but a better deal came up at the local bookstore. Never got around to returning it.
5,Speedy delivery,Bought this book for a class I took on campus and did not want to pay the extreme price on campus. Found it on here for a 1/3 of the cost and it was the extact same book it was perfect. Great ship time and wonderful customer service.
1,he was right: 3 weeks self-study training needed!,"WHY would someone make a game like this so complicated to play and NO training at the start. Grrr... impossible. The intro was a cool movie, but who has time for this??? You'd need a degree in spaceflight to get stated. Waste of money. Was put up for sale right after i got it!"
1,not a good game,"this game is horrible. Its controls are so old that you have toget used to flying with num keys and there is no online action sheet so you dont know what you are doing, the shipping was lightening fast for a garbage game, should have gotten a demo first."
1,Whoops!,"I got this game in hopes of a good adventure. Instead i got terrible controls, command problems, poorest where the enemy is and whom the enemy is tracking i've ever experinced in any game. Communication, ship functions, and user friendliness were shot to hell! Definitely DO NOT buy this game unless you have 4 arms and are masochistic."
3,only for hard core,this game has pretty much a good story line and some cool features but the controls for the game totally suck and make it into a complete nightmare to play.
2,Well I never,This game was not what I thought. I saw the picture of the cover to this game and thought it was like maybe Star Wars or something. I was suprised it was not even close in more ways to comment on in this review. Some may like this game so I won't trash it. Just 2 stars!!!
1,"TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE; Need 3 wks+ schooling to play","After the cool toy-like movie intro, which was neat, you are a boy living in space who sees his miner-father killed in an attack (it is like 15 minutes or so long, a little blocky-looking, like Toy Story), you are in a cockpit for training and see asteroid in front. Everything is whizzing by like you are turned sideways (looking out the side of a space vehicle), and all the tactical icons leave you confused as to what the target is or how to even destroy anything. If you move some, it sounds a collision alert and flashes but you have no idea what it is or where it is coming from or what to do. The game HAS NO training. I can't even believe Atari even made this, not even years ago for win98SE, it soooo awful. I shoved it back in the package, disappointed, and wondered how i could sell it, pawn it off on someone else. IT IS NOT A GAME, it is a coaster, a hot, steaming peice of doo-doo. Worthless ."
5,Great light!,"Bought this for the boat after the Practical Sailor review. It's tough, it's waterproof (after all it's a dive light), and the amount of light coming from four AAs is amazing. Great collimation as well - the beam cuts through light fog and mist very nicely. I just ordered a second one with the luminescent shroud."
1,Terrible Durability,"I have one of these holsters for my Estwing Rock Hammer. When I and some others went to field camp, most of us had holsters like this one attached to our belts so we could draw them out frequently for gathering samples, making fresh rock surfaces, or use in climbing. Everybody's holster, the same make and model as this one, broke except for mine. Mine was warped so badly as to be nearly unuseable. The snaps on this holster are also badly placed, since when you try to unsnap them, they simply lift the hammer upwards without coming undone. By the end of the trip, I had to rip the holster open with both hands, or just leave it open and hope I didnt lose my hammer in the process. Dont buy an all enclosing hammer holster like this one, its very difficult to hurt yourself on a hammer sitting tightly to your waist."
2,Did not prefer this type of holster,"I had this for over five weeks in the field and all I can say is I did not prefer it to other holsters I saw. If you going to get one, buy one that is simply a ring, it makes taking it out and putting it up much faster. I ended up just carrying my hammer most of the time because trying to clip both of the metal buttons became a huge pain in the ass for me."
2,Difficult to deal with...,"This sheath is rather difficult to deal with. I have had it for a while now and am still trying to get it broken in good. It's difficult to get the pick into and then it takes a good bit of work to get it snapped. I wondered for about a month if I hadn't gotten the wrong product because it just seemed that my pick was too big, but apparently it is the right sheath. I like the way it looks but for almost daily use it's just about too impractical to deal with."
3,"Partly snappy, partly not so good","The set seems to be 32 beat (though I haven't counted completely).CD 3 is really nice and the BPM is good mid-tempo arounr 137 - 140 and then from track 9 going into cool down at 133. I had to find out the bmp from another software because it isn't listed on the box - irritating!CD 2 is a good 125 to 130 speed - good for body workouts, but the tunes tend to get a bit boring.CD1 is also good for workout at 127 - 130 and the tunes are catchy. Happy mix. Only snag is that track one starts at 100bpm, track 2 jumps to 130 and then track 3 and 4 jump back down to 120! After this, things are stable at 127."
4,Great Deal,"I love classic movies and I've seen all of these before, so when I came upon a set with all four movies, I had to jump at the chance to get them at such a steal. All the movies were fantastic, however the packaging left much to be desired. Upon arrival the latch to open the case was broken and there were shards of plastic inside the case .... thankfully none of the DVDs got damaged."
4,Surge Protector with noise filter - mostly works for X10,"I bought this mostly to replace an X10 filter I had been using forever. When I got a new LCD TV, the X10 filter stopped keeping the noise from interfering with my X10 light controllers. With the Tripp Lite, the X10 works *most* of the time, but it seems to still let noise thru from time to time that causes trouble for the X10 equipment. X10 can be pretty finicky tho, so that's not to say the Tripp Lite unit is bad, it's just not perfect. It has done a *much* better job than the old X10 Filter was doing tho, so overall, I'm pretty happy with it."
5,Home entertainment center protection,"I have my flat screen TV,cable Box, blue ray, and amplifier plugged into this surge protector and feel very safe"
5,Tripp Lite ISOBAR4UL - great for treadmil,"Our treadmill kept tripping the circuit breaker on an adjacent breaker when turned on due to the newer circuits in our house. When plugged in to this Protector, not more circuit breaker tripping. Works like a champ. Apparently any appliance that has a moter with bushings can send signals through the electrical lines that can cause circuits to trip."
4,Seems to be constructed well with wall-mount option,"I've been requested to write a review of this product, but how do you know how well a surge protector works until it's triggered? You don't. It's definitely the heaviest surge protector I've ever owned, if that means anything. All I know is that it meets the specifications required by our generator. I'll update this review after we've had a power outage/fluctuation/surge."
3,The love of Freestyle,"Forget about the cheap looking cover the cd is good. My favorite songs on the cd are by Mystie,Manny,and Taimara all three give emotion to their songs which is what Freestyle is about,love and who you are.Nice job.Keep Freestyle alive!!!!!"
5,The Secret is Finally Revealed,This well respected and authentic depiction of this documentary should receive the upmost praises. Finally the History Channel brings to viewers how this demonic secretive fraternal society of hate and fear(Ku Klux Klan)was originated and is still presently preserved. I fully endorse any educator to show this video as a real portraiture of American History.
4,A history we can't ignore!,This movie brings out the best and the worst in American History. We see the rise of the KKK and the power they once had over minority population. It's not always pretty to look at but it is something knowone can deny. Worth buying!
5,Disturbing!,Great for my African American History class. We spent a few days discussing the impact of this movie and just how great the presence of this organization is in today's society
4,The Science of Mond,"I had the hardback of this book many years ago when I attended the Church of Religious Science in Phoenix, AZ. I am pleased once again to have found this book and plan to read through it - quite a large book and nice to have in paperback."
2,A shadow of its true self,"This is a condensed version of the original, but they don't tell you that. Also, many words are mispronunced, as an example the word duality became duelty."
1,Kindle version is the old version,Do not get the Kindle version of this book. It is the old 1926 version and isn't (probably) what you want.
1,Awful fomatting,"I am so disappointed with this kindle version. I really would like my money back. The formatting is terrible. It makes the manuscript almost impossible to read. None of the titles in the right place, some of the words have jumbled letter order which makes them incomprehensible. All in all a very disappointing Kindle experience. I cannot recommend this kindle edition to anyone, its sloppy beyond belief."
1,Science of Mind paperback,"VERY, VERY MISLEADING. The paperback is heavily edited and much is taken out from the hardcover issue. My beef is that there is no mention that the paperback is any different than the hardcover. I feel very deceived."
2,Some values not mentioned.....,"You would think that health longevity is a legit goal and value, but not mentioned in the book.So much depends on ones expectations. For me health longevity is a priority and hard to say when that task is done.In effect one is looking to gain more time, time to learn and explore. And time to change ones mind and body.(This book review has been adjusted 5/17)"
1,Bubblegum New Thought-Avoid It,I took the introductory course on Religious Science and this book was used as a text. I no longer practice it. The book and religion are terrible. The book is basically an elaborate explanation and text on how to use positive thinking to try to change your life. The author Holmes was wrong on many points such as disbelieving Reincarnation. My observations of the Chaplains using this Religion is that they have very messed up lives so if it doesn't work for them it certainly won't work for the average person. A much better religion is Unity where they have a better reasoned and more effective religion. A much better Unity book I highly recommend isLessons in Truth.
1,review of book,"I really was not impressed with this book. Like so many authors- or people for that matter, he reveals God as if he were outside of ourselves, when this simply is notthe truth. God is within and this is where people need to go - within themselves to seek the true nature of God's oneness - instead of reaching into the skyfor the man with a white beard who is going to judge you some day.I really thought that the author was much more universally aware and enlightened. I was very disappointed with the book, sorry.Thanks, Debbie"
1,Dilligently applied the process -- result - we crashed and burned,"I love to examine ""spiritual"", ""self help"", ""business"" books and systems. My wife and I put ourselves 100% into Science of Mind about 14 years ago. We worked through an abundance class. Result was the exact opposite -- Our thriving business crashed -- not just that, but payments sent to us were ""returned to sender."" This is just a portion of our experience. If you get this book -- burn it."
1,Book too wide,"Because the book is standard paper size, I find it difficult to read. I prefer a narrower page because it's easier for my eyes to take in an entire line."
5,Ernest Holmes Science of Mind,This is a terrific book. It was nice to find an old hardback version. Ernest Holmes' writings continue to be food for thought and Science of Mind teachings are very much like The Secret and Law of Attraction topics which have become more popular this past year or two. Many of those ideas seem to have come directly from Science of Mind (not the same as Scientology). It was recommended to me by a colleague and I am glad I spent the time reading it.
1,Not the RIGHT book for SOM Classes!,"I too purchased this book for my upcoming SOM class, and it was the wrong text. You need the 600 page original book for classes."
3,1928 Edition (for advanced students of SOM),"As a lifelong student of Ernest Holmes and Science of Mind, I am continuing to enjoy this, his earliest version of the ""text."" As some reviewers have noted, this version is not as widely read as the 1938 version, which can be easily identified by the first four chapters in the Table of Contents, starting with ""The Thing Itself..."" It is my understanding that the 1938 version was strongly based upon the 1926 version. It is organized, in my opinion, in a much more lucid manner. In any case, the 1938 version is used almost exclusively by all us religious scientists, and the 1926 version is perused at our leisure. (Note: I too find Amazon's placement in question, and wish the 1938 text to be first and foremost in the standins.)"
5,"Science of Mind, E. Holmes","I indicated that I already own this book, and I did not purchase it through Amazon, having owned my copy for around 20 years. Still, for anyone interested in the book, go for it. This is a classic work concerning the Creative Force as expressed through humanity, very clear and very enlightening."
5,Another in a long line of books like it...,"Ernest Holmes is a very brilliant guy. This is a delightful book. Let me summarize it here:""Your mind creates your reality. Literal. Yeah, it changes atoms and all of that. So use it and be careful not to misuse it.""It reminds me of:1. Christian Science2. A Course in Miracles3. Most New-Age StuffNonetheless, it is a great book to pickup when you are feeling like you need a fix for your spiritual seeking."
3,The Science of Mind,"The Science of MindI found this book logical and believable. It basically says ""you create your own destiny"" in a convincible way."
5,This book WILL change your life!,I am 45. I have read many self-help books. This is the first book that actually changed my life. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels his/her life could be better.
1,NOT the 1938 edition,"The item description for this book says it is the ""1938 edition with a foreword by Jean Houston"". It is NOT! It is the original 1926 edition, which is not at all the same book! It is interesting in its own right, but if you're looking for The Science of Mind ""textbook"", this isn't what you want."
1,Not the 1938 edition!,"From glancing at the index and the intro, I can see this is not the 1938 edition. It is the 1926 edition. It is set up as a series of lessons. This is absent from the 1938 edition. While it is an interesting read, it is far from what we as Religious Scientists call ""the textbook."""
3,"Profound book, but sloppy formatting for Kindle","Although the content of the science of mind is very profound, this $2.99 Kindle edition is formatted in a sloppy way - unworthy of the material. Do yourself a favor and buy a Kindle version that is nicely formatted."
5,Amazing!,"This is a great CD with great music! I have also heard the band play live and they sound amazing too! I highly recommend buying this CD and if you can make it out to one of their shows on their tour, it will be worth the trip!"
2,not so bad?,"Not very blown away to be honest...just another cookie cutter sound. I think some of the musicians are probably talented but they are restrained by the generic songwriting. The bassist is clearly tasty but the drummer's attempts at staying in the pocket are only partially successful. Travis does have a good voice and some interesting lyrics, but overall, the first reviewer had it right when he said it leaves the listener wanting more."
4,Exhaustive!!!,"Scholarly and exhaustive, this book will tell you more than you ever though possible about same sex couples in the 19th century LDS church. I think Quinn must have read every copy of the Deseret News and the Tribune up to the 20's. Amazing documentation and research."
3,Obvious hidden agenda.,"The book is well researched and the writing for once isn't tedious, (good job Dr. Quinn). However, Quinn really strains it at times to prove his ideas. This is Quinn's hidden agenda: The Mormon church during the 19th century was not as homophopic as it is now, therefore the Mormon church should not be so severe in its attacks and excommunications of Gay members of the church like myself. Quinn's whole purpose in writing this book is to try to say that the current LDS leaders are hypocrites because earlier leaders had more lenient attidutes towards homosexuality. The book is a good history of same-sex relations but the reader needs to be aware of the hidden agenda and the bias in Quinn's historical research and writing."
4,"If you Love Dance, You'll Love this video","This video isn't really for the person with ""two left feet"". It is a great dance video, although you need room in your home to do the moves full out. Even learning the steps, though, I worked up a good sweat. Its fun, dancy, and I love Kerrington (she was my favorite on SYTYCD and in the movie) so I really enjoy this video. Its great for a change in workout, and to me, doesn't even feel like a workout, feels more like the dance classes I take and its over just like that and you can't believe you just worked out for an hour. Have fun with it."
4,For the dancer,"This DVD fulfilled my desires to be in a dance class again. If you are used to dancing, this will be an appropriate level of learning. If you are completely inexperienced in dance, I wouldn't highly recommend this workout DVD. The combinations are fun, and you learn about eight counts at a time. The only complaint I have is that the choreography requires a bigger space to fully dance it out, so clear the room if you want to have the best experience."
2,Should have listened to other reviewers,"Three things you will need to enjoy this video:1. A large dance studio for a living room2. Years of dance experience3. The ability to learn a routine after seeing it only a few timesI have none of the above so I could not enjoy this video. The routines have people moving around a large space and traveling across the room. It's impossible to do in a average-sized living room. The ""teachers"" break down the routines into pieces, but only show a piece twice before they move on to the next. QUICK! I thought I would be able to learn it after watching repeatedly and rewinding, but I got frustrated and never used it again. They should market this to experienced dancers."
2,Frustrating cardio,"I tried the Fame Dance Workout thinking it would be dance-based cardio, rather than serious choreography, and was disappointed that it was the latter.Fans of the movie might enjoy the actors leading the workout segments, but while these three kids are good dancers, they are FAR from experienced fitness instructors, and that shows in their cueing: they use a lot terminology that would be unfamiliar to anyone who isn't also a dancer, and give very few useful directions. (Kristy, who does the African dance, is probably the LEAST bad.) They also stop and start a lot, which makes it difficult to establish flow.The one strength of this DVD is that if you can actually do the moves, it's decent exercise. I was able to follow along enough to burn some calories, but compared to alternatives like Debra Bono's African Dance series, CRUNCH Carido Salsa, Zumba, and the like, it's FRUSTRATING and lacks continuity.Bottom line: I do not recommend the Fame Dance Workout. :("
5,Gotta Love Quincy!,It's great! I used to race home after work to watch this show when it first aired. Now I have it forever!
4,questions !,"Great show,but I am hoping someone has the answers!#1 where is season 3 ?????????a season 1 & 2 pkg offered !a season 4 pkg offered !!!but no season 3 !!!which season has the somewhat memorable episode where Quincy develops a full bodyindentification from just one bone !!!---????I am seeking this season!!!"
4,"Great show, bad put together of this season!","I love Quincy so I was happy they finally released Season 4 after soooooo long! I was NOT happy about the lack of options on the CD's though. Plus, no info on episodes without ripping apart case. This season seems thrown together verses Seasons 1-2 and then 3. I am hoping Season 5 in March will be better."
5,"QUINCY,ME-SEASON FOUR",I REALLY ENJOYED QUINCY WHEN IT WAS ON TELEVISION. I REALLY LIKE HOW HE TAKES MATTERS IN HIS OWN HANDS WHEN THERE HAS BEEN AN MURDER COMMITTED.HE STAYS ON TOP UNTIL THE MURDER IS SOLVED. THANKS
5,best medical examiner show ever quincy is the man,best medical examiner show ever periode ......lests hope shout finishs off the rest of the seasons and mabey re does the first set which was UGH put on crappy double sided disks ..and hey shout finish that inspector gadget set you started :)
5,Perfect replacement,No need for many words: this product is a perfect replacement of the original blade.
4,This book has it all!,"This book is packed with useful information, and all of it can be incorporated into an existing Star*Drive ease. If you spend a lot of time in the verge, this book is for you. The steep price is because of the slick pages, much like the hardbound books. It's definetly worth it, though!"
5,Excellent Movie,"I'm a big John Wayne fan and this is one of my favorite movies. I could not find this movie anywhere else, so I was extremely pleased to find it through Amazon. This is an oldie, but goodie for John Wayne, but the quality of the DVD was excellent. I was very happy with the choice."
4,Wayne the Comedian,"Not your typical Wayne action movie. John plays a softer, more humerious role in this movie and is really good. Wayne showed he had the ability to do comedy and the movie was light-hearted fun. The love story angle was weak, but the Duke never was a good kisser. Must see fun film."
5,Donovan's Reef,"I wish Hollywood made films like this today. Great Wayne, Marvin, Warden, and Allen. Wonderful story line."
5,"Donovan's Reef, a Great Christmastime Movie","Yes, it's old with old time values and attitudes, but I love it!"
4,Wayne on Water,"Don't expect a movie monument with this light film, only movie magic. This film falls into a niche of films that appears to have been made just for the opportunity of the participants to play off of each other. The enjoyment and affection of all the actors in this film is obvious from the first scene. The old pro's in this film walk through the un-challenging script with ease. This is a simple movie produced only for entertainment, and that can be refreshing in an age of 'message' movies. Curl up on the couch with some popcorn on an evening and enjoy these deceased actors from an equally deceased age of film-making. You won't regret it."
5,Donovons Reef,"Everything about the DVD was perfect, the color, voice and no skips or other decects in thre DVD. have seen it twwice since I bought it and it is A One. I have seen a copy on VHS that I made years ago and i finally threw it away because of the imprefectons of over the years use and was happy when on I found it on DVD Thank you., I am 92 and hope to see it many more times. Ralph Frank"
4,The Duke in a Comedy,This is one of the Duke's family movie night specials that isn't a western. Sometimes us girls like a little comedy and romance in our movies and this one is packed with both.
3,Aloha Memories,"Living in Kauai, where this movie was set, makes for a delightful trip down memory lane. The Duke shows the island before it became a tourist mecca."
4,Superb Wayne / Lee Marvin in Hawai'i movie,"Obviously not the first of last timeWayne and Marvin got together but itwas a very fun time for the 'Duke'.This movie and McClintock came outabout year, 1963, before PresidentKennedy's murder. JFK loved the Dukeas well as most of the rest of Ame-rica. This was when movies made sense."
4,For John Wayne lovers,Very enjoyable but not the best of the John Wayne movies I have. Most of the actors were good except for Dorothy Lamour..what a ham.
5,Donovan reef,Well first the time to get it to me was great Second the DVD play great no problem with It and yes I would say that you can't go round buying here. I will and have a great time viewing what I received so far.Ron J
3,Fun in the Sun With John Wayne,"Well, I couldn't help hearing ""C&H; Pure Cane Sugar . . . "" every time they played the theme music, but other than that, I guess I enjoyed this movie. I must say, though, that I never really understood the fight that breaks up the bar just out of some sort of masculine exuberance. I guess it's a guy thing.This might be taken as a movie with reference to racial prejudice, but if so, you will have to admit that the prejudice is against the ""old maid from Boston,"" not the half-Hawaiian children who are so very charming. Fact is, the ""old maid"" was not old, and not stuffy, and they didn't need to hide the kids.Still, it's a light-hearted movie, on the whole, and who can argue with the setting? It's some anonymous Hawaiian island, but it's just plain beautiful."
5,Classic John Wayne,"If you like John Wayne and Lee Marvin, then you'll enjoy the two of them together in this South Sea Island story. The prim and proper New England daughter of the island doctor comes for a visit while the doctor is on another island. John Wayne pretends that the doctor's half Polynesian children are his own causing clashes and comedy and leading to romance. In the meantime, Lee Marvin is an old Navy buddy of John Wayne's and comes to the island to take the bar (Donovan's Reef) away from John. Fights, misunderstandings, and romance make for a good John Wayne movie."
2,Lost scenes,"The movie was still very good, but I couldn't believe how many scenes were cut. Even scenes that I have recently scene on tv were missing. And I saw no reason for it.The major scene missing is one where you see the daughter riding in the back of the jeep into town. The jeep bounces and she falls onto the ground. At the end of the movie this happens again and you hear John Wayne say ""not again"". Which makes no sense since the first time is missing.Except for the missing scenes, the movie is very enjoyable."
3,Good movie...Soft DVD,"This is a very fun movie from John Ford & John Wayne, Unfortunately, the DVD presentation is rather on the soft side. There are no very clear shots of the actors, and that is a real shame. If only Paramount had gone to the same effort that MGM had on restoring this movie like ""The Horse Soldiers"".Oh Well, it's still a fun movie, and is finally presented in it's originally aspect ratio of 1:185. A gem of movie, that Paramount could have made a whole lot more fun, if it had tried to restore properly!"
4,Donovan's Reef,"I ordered this DVD for a friend who wanted it, so I can't really rate the movie except to say that anything with John Wayne in it has to be good. I will say that I was very pleased with the prompt service I received from Amazon. The DVD arrived in just a couple of days, and my friend was very pleased."
4,Some tender moments,".This has some of the typical John Wayne features of his movies: barroom brawls and his humorous problems with women. Be that as it may, it does have redeeming tender moments. I think it is worth owning and watching every once-in-a-while. Good scenery of Kauai where it was filmed. Trivia: The house used in this film was on the beach at the time, but was later re-located to a hilltop nearby."
4,Cute,Donovan's Reef is one of my favorite movies from John Wayne. I like the funny movies he did better than the serious ones.
5,EXCELLENT JOHN WAYNE MOVIE TO REMEMBER,ANOTHER MOVIE BY JOHN WAYNE THAT CAN NOT BE FORGOTTEN - WITH JOHN GONE FOREVER WE CAN NOT LET MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE ALSO GO FOREVER - PLEASE KEEP THEM ALIVE
2,This is one of my favorite movies,This has been one of my favorite movies over the years. I enjoy the interaction on John Wayne and Lee Marvin. It is just fun to watch.This particular copy that I got has a minor glitch and that is the voice and video are not in sync.
5,Blast from the Past,Watched and loved this movie as a kid. It's a great film with great actors. John Wayne is fabulous as always and so is Lee Marvin & Dorothy Lamor. My favorite oldie but it's truly a goody!
4,Great old classic,"As time progresses, and I age, I like to revisit the great old classics that I owned on tape and purchase them on disk. This is one such.The quality is better then the old tape, but not up to new DVD. Glad I purchased it."
4,True Adventure Fun Read,"The Cloud Garden came to my attention through a review in Outside Magazine. True adventure books make for an excellent break from novels and heavier literary works. This one is a perfect example. The story is gripping, the characters are likeable, and the book is hard to put down. The bad guys are painted honestly and roundly as real people. No one is all good nor all bad. This is a story about survival, wits, humanity and the romantic ideals of adventure of which so many of us dream. Find your synopsis elsewhere."
4,Who misses the point?,Criticisms alone rarely carry any weight or provide solutions to unsolved issues... Dr. Conley merely points out the working conditions for women in the academic arena at Stanford. I'm very much in awe of Dr. Conely's courage for writing such a book; working conditions as described by Dr. Conley not only exist at Stanford but also everywhere else. The solutions rest in the hands of those who wish to change and not just Dr. Conley alone.
5,"Insight from ""Walking Out on the Boys"".",I am a long time therapist that worked in university affiliated hospitals and find that I was rather naive. But my daughter is in medical school andplans to be a neurosurgeon and I found this book (that I read within two days) provides plenty of conversation regarding the past and present.It was excellent and gives a historical perspective of how are society is changing and in some instances not changing.
5,Walking out on the Boys,"Fast Shipment and Great Book about how threatened Men are working with WomenSad that Men couldn't work together, that would make the world better"
5,Immunity Syndrome: Best Episode?,"""Obsession"" is a great episode (particularly for those interested in the origins of the Matt Decker character in the first movie). However, for my money, ""T.I.S."" is among the very best episodes in the original series. Why? One of the most compelling sci-fi statements of all time coming from the mouth of Dr. McCoy: that humans are mere anitbodies in the organism that is our galaxy."
3,So close to being a classic...,"The author does a superb job of exploring the events leading up to the Battle of France in May 1940, amply supporting his ideas as to why Germany defeated France when it should have been the other way around. Often during my reading, I compared this book's style and content to the classic ""Guns of August"" by Barbara Tuchman. But then he seems to run out of steam. May only devotes three rushed chapters to the battle, itself. While it was a good overview of the battle, I was expecting much greater detail. I felt let down. For the serious student of WWII, this is worth reading for the preview to the battle, just don't expect a solid play by play of the actual fighting."
5,"Finally, the perfect litter box!","I love this litter box. Oliver, my cat, loves it, too! It is so easy to clean, it comes with its own scoop that sits conveniently in a holder at the back of the box. This litter box is also very stylish!I was using the Booda Igloo litter box before, but that one doesn't have as much room as it looks like it would and was very messy, so I switched to this one. Love it!"
1,Charlie's Box,My cat used this box once and then I threw it away!The lid doesn't stay on for carrying and the material is scratched way too easily. Don't buy this product; especially if you have a cat with renal failure.
3,Interesting read,Good read but a little confusing to start with. It takes a few pages to really understand where the writer is heading with this story
5,Moving,"This captures your attention and makes you think. I find it moving and enlightening. As all of Cassell's works, it is well-written and more than entertaining."
5,A stunning testament to a father's love,This is such a beautiful and poignant story about one man's love for his daughter and how far he's willing to go to protect her from harm. The story has so much honesty and faith. I ended it with a lump in my throat and a wish that everyone in the world had the faith and love of this father.
5,An Outstanding Tale,"In ""Lest We Forget"", John Cassell does an impressive job in combining love of family, love of country, service to country, the horrors of war, and dumb luck in a well woven tale that will keep you reading and wondering till the last sentence is read. The skill with which he ties in a man's service in the military with his daughter's and the dumb luck he experienced with the tragedy that will befall her is masterful. Read the first page and dare to try to stop, you will find your heart racing as characters enter the story and the dreaded day of payback creeps up the main character.With an opening dedication to his daughter who is currently serving in Iraq today, ""Lest We Forget"" opens your soul to the deep love of a parent for his child and both for their country."
1,Beating about the bush all the time,"I became quite impatient during the course of reading this book, for the authors keep beating about the bush all the time - they just don't address the problems right on.As a result, this is a discursive work which is high on principles but provides little insight or help to the reader when it comes to the solving of practical problems.Even after finishing the entire book, one doesn't learn much more about the subject."
4,It was very high quality.,I was very satisfied with the quality and workmanship. The oak was very good wood. It was a little bigger than I expected it to be.
4,A reasonable history for its time,"Having heard of this book for years and having read The Threat,I decided to buy it. I was not disappointed. Keeping in mind it was published in 1975 it is very reasoned account of the early history of UFO sightings. There is reasonable account of the rise and fall of NICAP and the Robertson Panel as well as the Condon Report. As I had read all about these committees from other sources, it appears Jacobs adapts an historian's tone, not that of either a believer or debunker. I did not feel that he was prosteltyzing one way or another. The book makes a good companion to Richard Dolan's UFO's and the National Security State. Each complements the other and presents the case that more needs to be done in this field. Some later writers are indebted to Jacobs for having shown the way."
5,User friendly and simple to use!,"Within 2 hours of purchase, I had stock quotes and sports scores streaming across my favorite stations saved in my preset channels.This has got to be one of the most user friendly units out there. I've seen (and like) the SkyFi2, but this unit is much more intuitive for the user.I like the one button FM tuner in case you need to switch frequencies near a large city. I use the built in FM modulator and drive the panhandle of Florida on I-10 from Marianna to Jacksonville regularly with excellent reception the entire way.I placed the antenna on my dashboard and get very good results.I'd recommend the Audiovox to anyone!"
5,Ok,This is not what I expected. Accessoried couldnt be purchased for it like I thought. There is no home docking station for it. But it worked in my friends car. I gave it away.
4,Finally,"I finally got a groove for this album on the second cd. The first disc seems like the same groove for four tracks and doesn't switch until Mike Vanderberg's Spooky. I gave Sander K a chance and bought This is everybody on tour, and I wasn't necessarily feeling that. I gave this album a chance, and established a liking for this high ranked dj. The form of the album reminds me of Sasha-Ibiza in the sense that it takes half the first cd to establish a groove and then follows through with great transitions on the second cd."
5,"clean, energetic, and simple",CD 1: 5 starsCD 2: 5 starsThis mix is my first Sander K compilation and boy did it come out of left field and knock me on my butt. The entire set is put together differently than most sasha/digweed types out there. It is more focused on beats and how they combined together. Sander K does an awesome job of making the experience a roller coaster ride. First the set starts off slow and builds. Then bam! You're thrown into this blend of clean and rhythmic beats. Pretty soon you can't stop tapping your foot and nodding your head. NuBreed is always a mix you can come back to months later and still have awe and appreciation for it. A pure classic.
2,Disappointed,"I'm really surprised at all the great reviews. I bought this CD only because of the reviews. I am a big fan of trance, house, techno, etc. but this set is rather blah. He might be a great mixer but I prefer a track selection that I can dance to."
4,first half is great...,but that seems to be all i got. two copies of disc01 :-(and it's so tantalizingly infectious that i'm incredibly bummedthat i don't have disc02. i wonder if anyone out there gottwo disc02's????
3,not as tall as i thought,"Based on the picture i expected to be able to fold over the top to cover normal 8.5"" x 11 pages for easy transportation (like a pocket folder). However the total width including the flaps is only 9.5"". I am sure it says this in the description of the product."
3,Too short!,"This is a very light and sturdy tent which holds up well in hard rain and high winds. My main problem is that, as a person 6' tall, I seem to be unable to sleep without either hitting my head or feet on the interior. A few inches more and this annoying problem would be solved. Entering and exiting (done from the side) are more awkward than any tent I have ever owned or used, especially in hard rain when one does not have the luxury of first laying on the ground and rolling/sliding in. Also, the front stay assembly is poorly designed, necessitating the use of two stakes when only one would be required if it were better designed. A workaround is simply adding a loop of cord."
1,Not much there.,"This book is a waste of time. What a disappointment. I've been doing live sound for years, and am interested in tips on how to improve. The advice in this book is so basic and general as to be useless. Talk to others, Slone recommends. Duh. There are a couple tips on mic placement worth thinking about (how to mic a guitar amp to get various tonal qualities). Not much else for anyone with any experience at all.Could this be targeted for the rank beginner? If so, it fails there as well. One might expect that this book would run through the basics of how to hook up a sound system. What cable plugs in where? But it doesn't. If you're a beginner, you're just as clueless after reading this as if you'd never picked it up. Heck, you might even be more confused.No desctiptions of what all those gadgets in the rack are and how to use them.I feel bad about being so negative, and I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings - but this book is quite worthless."
4,Great new recordings!,"I was excited to learn a mini-anthology of Maestro Ifukube's film compositions was out there featuring NEW recordings, not the same recycled cuts that appear on countless other CDs.This 2 CD set focuses more on Ifukube's non sci-fi film scores, though tracks from Godzilla '54 and Ghidora, The Three Headed Monster do appear.An unfortunate draw-back to this compilation is that all liner notes are in Japanese. Thus, unless you speak Japanese, you really are left in the dark as to what piece of music comes from what film. The orchestra and conductor, also, are mysteries.That aside, the music really comes to life in these new digital recordings. I highly recommend this set to any fan of Akira Ifukube."
3,Dense and anachronistic,"I think the reader will get lost here and come away with a misapprehension about the times unless they already have a strong background in European history.You really have to read this book critically because some parts are bizarre. I remember at one point the writer describes artists as being involved in several businesses, such as owning rental property, with the aim of providing for their retirement. While in individual cases, I am sure this was true, as a description of the role of artists in society I can't believe it is widely true in early modern society only beginning to develop a middle class. Who knows what is meant by ""retirement"" in an era when several generations of a family might live in the same house, and work work together in the same artists' workshop, and when average life expectancy was in the 30s and people could drop dead of blood poisoning at any time from a hangnail. That sounds like anachronism to me."
1,Paperback version has the worst print quality,"This is a fascinating book. You can find this as a free e-book online. If you want print and bound, buy the hardback version!! The paperback is the WORST. The photo Plates are so poor, they are worse than photocopies. You cannot tell what the pictures or images are. Even the text is fuzzy. The original book seemed to be scanned at low resolution, which means the output (this reprint) is of pooooooooor quality. I recommend it hardback."
4,Nearly as good as the grammy winning CD,"Wow - can these guys play. Lukather the ""childish"", noisy one, Carlton the ""mentor"" with lots of elegance. But please: Remember to buy the duo's Grammy Award winning CD ""No substitutions"" produced buy Steve Vai and Lukather. The CD is even better than the DVD. The song lists are about identical - and Carlton's solo after EXACTLY 8 min.s on the CD is just... FANTASTIC!!!"
1,Where's Lukather??,"I'm not sure what DVD the rest of the reviewers got, but this particular one does NOT have Steve Lukather on it anywhere!! Larry Carlton doesn't have much of the spotlight either so if you're really looking for a DVD that showcases him, this is a bad choice. The other performers are average at best and the vocals are really poor on most songs. Don't waste your money on this one!!"
3,Smaller than it looks,"I love the idea of this to hold mail, kids small toys, keys and whatever else we bring in the house & drop wherever. However, I was surprised by how small it really is. I thought the canvas baskets would be larger and more sturdy. I was hoping to store our newspaper, too, but the bins are way too small and flimsy for that. I still like it & will use it near our front entrance. I am going to try to get something for the bottom of each bin to make it more sturdy."
2,Poorly made,It was broken in two places when I first opened the box. It is really cute but poorly made. It would fell if I put magazine weight in it. I ended up putting on my baby`s room for little toys so it doens`t break. =(
4,Informative without being inundatory,"It seems that this book (I'm referring to the 1963 edition) was written for school children. Do not let that stop you from picking it up. At once informative and interesting, without providing superfluous details nor being written in a lofty or complex style, I was surprised that I did not become bored. Scientific discoveries, Pasteur's personal life, and political repercussions are included. The sporadic illustrations of his crystals, experiments, and microorganisms aid in understanding his concepts and results. This guy developed a vaccine for anthrax before we had even heard of it (namely because most people born in the 19th century are now dead...)!"
3,Bad buttons -nice sound,"Just bought this at Costco on Black Friday for use in my classroom. Sound is fine and player doesn't have a big footprint.I am greatly disappointed in the remote! I was counting on it to work as I move around the area where we are singing and dancing. The buttons don't respond well. I have to push and push and try to feel where exactly the contact point is to make the mp3 player respond. I see another reviewer wrote about the difficulty of using the remote, so I guess it isn't just my machine."
4,"Good sound, some details need work","I bought this to use in the bedroom. The sound is pretty good, and there is plenty of bass. I don't use the CD player a lot, but I haven't had the problems others have reported with it. It will not play MP3 CD's. The three biggest problems:The display is way too bright, and there is no way to dim it. We have to cover it up when we go to bed. My old Teac unit automatically dimmed when you activated the sleep timer, this is a step backwards.It will not charge my Touch 2G, and the dock is a little sloppy to plug into.The remote is pretty useless. The membrane buttons don't work that well, and they all feel the same. The range is quite short, and you have to be precise in aiming it.Really though, I didn't find anything else for the price that I liked as well."
2,Static with Ipod Touch over Wifi,"This unit worked fine with Nano and 5G Ipod, but there is static when playing AOL radio with Ipod Touch (new 2.0 software) over wifi. Plays stored Itunes music fine. Have tried moving speakers, dock, and cables, but no luck."
2,disappointed,"Weak radio attenna, and relatively incompatible with the newest IPOD Nano's.Did not expect these problems, & would discourage any new buyers based upon ownexperience."
3,Good and bad,"Bought this unit last year, but not through amazon. For the most part, loved the sound quality for the cost.One hitch that bugged me was the fact that when I bought it (last year), the Ipod dock does not work with the newer generation Ipod and Iphones and the sales person had told me you could buy just the dock when they update the system. Well, TEAC updated the dock, and I just contacted TEAC directly. They told me that you can not buy any of the components separately. You have to buy a new system. I really didn't know what to say, you can not buy replacement components??? Go figure, makes no sense. With Apple keep updating their IPods and Iphone, you would think that buying a replacement dock would be an option?"
1,Cd mechanism failed after 6 month,"After 6 months of light usage, less than 100 hrs on the CD player, the DX32i CD section of the system started to malfunction, whirling and clicking but not reading any tracks. I have a belt-mounted portable JVC CD player that I've bang around for 10 years and it still play reliably. So why can't Teac design a stationary player with better reliability?"
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,"I can't say how impressed I was with this product when I first set it up. The sound was great for such a compact system and it operated flawlessly. Unfortunately, the first day of ownership was the best day I had with this product.The volume control began to malfunction sporatically and the remote control failed completely within a week. I also noticed a strange static or popping distortion coming from the speakers. Within two weeks, the static and distortion became unbearable. I contacted TEAC but their consumer service technicians were useless.Needless to say, I've traded the TEAC for a Sony. I'll never buy a TEAC product again and I'm convinced that TEAC must be a subsidiary or FIAT. Absolute junk!"
4,I like this one cause of the subwoofer,"I have a slightly older version of this player, and like it quite well. Good sound for the size, and the subwoofer makes a big difference. Works great as a computer audio system, too."
3,Serves its purpose,"I bought this because I have a similar stereo system and I needed to replace the CD player. For some reason it would not accept the identical woofer system from my system so I replaced the woofer and the woofer cord has a slice in it. Nothing serious, I taped it, but it would have been nice if someone had quality controlled the pieces. I had some problems with getting the item much later than expected, however, the seller was quick to react and credit my shipping costs."
1,Cannot Power On,"Bought this system from Target because I want to start using it today in my empty apartment. After everything is hooked up, found out it cannot be powered on. Disappointed."
3,wont play mp3 cds,"i like the look and the sound but i can't get it to play mp3 cds. Like another reviewer, if you touch anything the main cable falls out. I'd still give it 4 stars if it would play the mp3 cd."
2,Blues Clues Preschool,"I was so excited when I purchased this game for my 3 yr old. However I was so disappointed when we actually played the game. It is not very interactive, the program is slow, not challenging compaired to another game that we recently purchased (reader rabbit preschool) My 3 yr old does like the present store and the signature music at the end. I would not recommend this. Get something else."
3,"Eh, it's okay","Not as fascinating as Sesame Street, that's for sure, but it's given my son a fair run for my money. It's not as interactive as I'd like, as there aren't too many things to click on, and the background music gets a little annoying after a while, but he likes it, so I'm happy."
2,Understanding Electric Dog Training,This book was shipped promptly and in good condition. I am disappointed in the contents because it was written specifically with older models of Tri-Tronic e-collars in mind.
5,A costume your child can wear everyday,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old to wear for Halloween knowing it would be something he could wear more than once, and will probably fit into again next year. It is big on him now but still looks cute. When he is 4 it may fit perfectly. The quality is very good and the fabric is durable and easy to wash."
