4,The Partner,"John Grisham's novel, THE PARTNER was in a way unsatisfying. The partner of an up-and-coming law firm steals about 90 mil from his fellow partners after faking his death. He then moves out of the country, gets plastic surgery, and is unable to be found. Years later, He is discovered, kidnapped, beaten then handed over to the FBI.The partner starts out like that seinfeld episode where it starts from the end and goes backwards. You meet the main character when he is being caught and you s-l-o-w-l-y discover how he did it. By about the fourth to the last chapter, I already knew the ending. It was attemped to be presented as a 'twist' but, sad to say, it wasn't.I would read this book, just dont expect a twisty ending."
4,"A great read, but a disappointing ending.","This is the first John Grisham book that I have read and I really loved it. My mom has his whole collection and I will be asking her if I can borrow, eventually, all of them. I, like many of the other reviews, was disappointed with the ending. While I knew there was going to be a surprise at the end and I wanted a surprise, this wasn't what I had in mind. I guess that makes it a true surprise, but still a disappointing one."
3,Good read,"Overall, I thought ""The Partner"" was a good read. I had originally planned to read the book over a space of about a week, but ended up reading in it 2 days, because I found that I just couldn't put it down. I found myself thinking about the book when doing other things like walking the dog and eating, and I found myself getting excited and wanting to rush home and read more. I had heard that the ending was poor. But having finished the book, where else could Grisham take the ending? I think he did as good a job as he could have done with the ending. Summing it up, this read has made me look forward to Grishams next novel after the Brethran."
2,Starts off great and has a disappointing finish,"The beginning of this novel grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the just past the middle. Unfortunately, at that point you can kind of guess where its going (except for the ending). Its still a good read, but don't expect the same calibre as his previous novels"
5,Something both Grisham and his editors missed,"For a lawyer who knows everything about the U.S. Legal system, John Grisham has apparently not realized that there's no such thing as passport control when leaving the U.S. especially at Miami International Airport from which I have departed hundreds of times. This is a key point in the plot as it leads to the capture of Eva by the FBI."
3,Great story with an ending that will make you scream,"I enjoyed reading ""The Partner"" and I would recommend it to all those Grishman fans. But try to be in a good mood when you get to the end because the ending is unbeliveable. Never has a book made me get so upset about the ending. I was so shocked at the end that my copy was flying through the air in my apartment."
3,"Attention-grabbing start, disappointing ending","My attention, as usual with Grisham's writing, was taken captive from the start. The opening chapters made for the promise of an intriguing story, and it delivered.The ending, however, felt like a betrayal to the reader. It is not the ending that makes me feel such -- instead it is that I feel certain characters would never have acted in certain ways at the beginning with what we come to understand near the ending. I feel very purposefully misled.I believe I'll shelve The Partner and go read The Firm for the 4th time. It never disappoints."
3,Excellent book with a bad ending,"I simply could not put this book down, but I am a Grisham fan. I was engulfed in getting to the end and find out what happened, but once I reached the end, I hated the book. I felt really let down by the ending. To me, it wasn't the normal Grisham."
1,You'll hate the ending!!!!!!,It's the worst ending to a book I've ever read! I'll never buy one of his loser books ever again!
5,Best Grisham book ever!,"I have read most of John Grisham's books, but this was the best since A Time to Kill. I could not stop reading and the twisted plot kept me guessing all the way. I was completely shocked at the surprise ending. I highly recommend it!"
3,Good Read...Typical Grisham Ending,"I've read all of Grisham's books. About a third of the way into this one, I correctly guessed how it would end. I kept holding out hope that I would be wrong, but alas, I wasn't. The plot and details were captivating but I wish the main character had a little more depth of soul."
3,"AWESOME, YET......","The first moment I laid my eyes on this particular book I felt in love with its catchy cover.The beginning of the book proved to be really exciting and total can't-put-down.As the story develops I found it more and more difficult to believe that such a crime or tall-tale can be dealt with. I mean, seriously how many of the white-collar pimps out there could manage to escape every single charges rested upon him. It's just too easy. Too easy and absurd from the likes of John Grisham. Though it's not a total let down, judging from his previous writings, I still find that it could have been better.I'm 15 and love reading on stuff like this alike. (Mr.Grisham, if you reading this i hope you not angry). This last book of yours made reading Goosebumps at night a plesure."
2,Pure Crapola,"I think Grisham has lost his touch from his days ofA TIME TO KILLI mean THE PARTENER was close to no brainer except for the twisted end.Grishams is at his best inA Time to KIll,The Chamber, andThe Rainmaker.Very close to them is THE FIRM andif i may say THE Client.Run Away Jury and THE PARTENER seemed to be one and the same. Run away Jury had some valued information on tobaccoIndustry's Garbase. and The Partener Well you figure it out.I think the partener was a give away story without the ending."
4,good read but the ending needed work,"Lots of twists and people getting what they deserved as the book wore on. Somehow the ending appeared hurried or just not well thought out. It was like a good date gone awry after the lights went out. I just didn't know what hit me, but I knew I wasn't satisfied"
3,Disappointing ending,"John G had another good one going. Until the end, that is. Grisham has always provided satisfying endings in the past. For some reason, he dropped the ball here. I probably won't buy the next Grisham novel until after, I have heard from others.I talked to one other reader who said she didn't like the ending either.Norman Sharp, Noblesville, Indian"
2,Predictability strikes again,"Once again Mr. Grisham has disapointed readers by failing toilluminate secondary characters to anything past cartoonish status.While Mr. Grisham is clever in his use of legal manuverings to generate plot lines; his failure to develop characters readers care about, causes one to speed through his recent books without a care. Books such as A Time to Kill and The Chamber created characters the reader should be interested in. In his recent books, Mr. Grisham fails to develop what should be the most important element of any book, characters the reader can identify with, pro or con. Perhaps Mr. Grisham should take a year or two off rather than continue to churn out movie scripts. Harsh words, but spoken by someone who is truly a fan of the author."
3,I'd rather re-read one of his others,"After reading a Grisham book every Memorial Day weekend for the past few years, I was really disappointed. Yes, the plot kept you going, but the pay off was disappointing. Patrick's a ""hopeless romantic"" (with apologies to Joan Wilder)"
3,"Not his best, not his worst.","After having read all of Grisham's books (some more thantwice), I can say that ""The Partner"" is okay. There is noother word that describes it more accurately in my opinion. It is a good read on a very boring Sunday afternoon, if you don't play gholf. It is more in the league of ""The Rainmaker"", which means I will not read it a second time. It concerns a young innocent partner (yeah sure) who was very devious (in a good way) in dealing with his, oh so corrupt firm of older mean lawyers - sound familiar? Right on! As with all of Grisham\222s other novels, it is an easy and somewhat absorbing read, but please don\222t expect ""A Time to Kill"" - It will not keep you awake until 2am the next morning, but might give you pleasant dreams."
2,This book equals none of his others.,"I've read far less enthralling books but this defenitely is Grisham's worst.I started reading it immediately after finishing The Runaway Jury"" (which was great!) and I was disappointed. In fact I just kept on reading because I wanted to get over with it and start another book."
2,Yawn. Is it over yet?,"Not only was the book written in cookie-cutter Grisham style,it was much less interesting and intriguing than other Grisham books.Grisham did an adequate job of explaining things, but many of the explanations were thin at best. Additionally, I didn't feel as though he developed the character as much as say, The Firm.Finally, the ending was poorly contrived and unbelievable. Grisham spends the entire book painting things one way and then tries to convince the reader that it was all a farce in two pages. I'm not saying it should always be a happy ending -- just a believable one."
5,One of the best,It was an extremely interesting book. Well worth reading and I think the ending was very appropriate. Probably my second favorite by John Grisham with The Rainmaker just barely coming first.
1,Awful!,"John Grisham is the worst writer ever. He gives us no reason to remember either character or plot once we've turned the page. This book, like, I assume, all of his books,is a complete waste of time."
4,One of Grishams Best!,"The action continues and does not slow down until the FBI makes a final stop to the man who stole the firms money. $33,000,000 is a whole lot of money for one guy to carry over his shoulders after stealing it cold. After faking a death and leaving his wife, friends, and family behind and stating a new life as a rich man, ex-lawyer deserves the worst of carma..."
2,The ending nearly ruined the entire book...,"I am a big Grisham fan, but with each additional Grisham that I read, the more they run together in my head. A great storyteller that makes his books a quick read, Grisham has mastered the formula to make consumerism push him to the top, but the hype that now surrounds new releases is more a hope to live up to the high standard set by his earliest works. The most troublesome aspect of this particular book, though, comes literally in the last two pages. One of the greatest disappointments, the ending was a total surprise in the most negative way. I almost felt sorry for spending so much time reading the first 466 pages because it all seemed for naught. Sorry John, hopefully this is not a ""Testament"" of what is to come...."
4,In typical John Grisham fashion... a great book!,"I had a hard time at first trying to feel sympathy for a lawyer who stole $90 million, faked his death leaving behind a wife and daughter, and starting over with a beautiful stranger (also a lawyer) in another country. As the story unraveled though Patrick Lanigan became less of the ""bad guy"" I first imagined. Twists and turns along the way, _The Partner_ kept me turning pages and wanting more. Another hit by John Grisham!"
3,The ending stinks.,"I was caught up in the wonderful story and was completely disappointed with the ending. If you skip the last chapter, it's worth the read, if you read the last chapter, you may decide to never read Grisham again."
2,The ending ruined the rest of the book!,"I agree with mike.sue -- bad, bad, BAD ending. Put me in a sad mood for days! I can't abide Grisham's view of human nature and so will also not be reading more of his works -- want my copy?"
1,Illiterates,Just scan through the other reviews; all of the folks who give this novel 5-stars are illiterate--or are too slovenly to correct typing errors. That tells you all you need to know about THE PARTNER
4,an highly provacative and intelligent read!,This was one of my favorite John Grisham novels I have read to date. It was suspenseful and a pleasure to read. I highly recommend this book to a john grisham fan
1,The ending ruined the entire experience of the book!!,"Don't bother. Even though the book was lucrative, colorful and interesting, the unrealistic, oversimplified and extremely exasperating ending leaves a bad taste in the reader's mouth. After finishing the book, I felt I wasted my time and I haven't read a novel by the usually talented, occasionally awful Mr. Grisham. It will take me a long time to recover from this pathetic attempt at a Stephen King ending."
4,"Still a lawyer book, but a little more original","After several books with basically the same plot, (The firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client), and one that was just plain boring,(The Rainmaker)it was a relief to read something different from Grisham. The plot is interesting and the Lanigan's recalling of the events is very entertaining. You'll probably either really love or really hate the ending. I liked it!"
5,Absolutely brilliant throughout--A joy to read!,"I have enjoyed several of Grisham's movies, without ever reading the book, and I must say that the reading experience far outshines the two-and-a-half hours of his movies. ""The Partner"" is a fast paced page turner that grabs you and doesn't let go, and although I was mildly disappointed with the ending, nothing could tarnish the brilliance of the first 460 pages. Way to go John!"
2,A substandard Grisham novel.,"John Grisham is an excellent writer. Having said that I'm not sure what happened when he wrote this book.The story had many holes, and the ending appeared to be so rushed as to not fit the story at all.Definitely not one of his better works."
2,Shaky Partner,"The Partner has an interesting plot, but fails to deliver on it. A lawyer fakes his own death, steals 90 million from his partners and escapes to South America. Patrick Lanigan is the lawyer and after four years, he is caught and brought back to Biloxi to face charges against him. Before returning he is almost tortured to death and due to this he is allowed to stay in a hospital instead of jail. While in the hospital he clues his lawyer and his judge friend in on the details of his escape. Everything falls into place too easily and of course Patrick gets away with everything. No one would have as much luck as he had or be that smart to get away with it and it makes the story not very believable. The ending does a fairly interesting twist, but the problem with it is that you see it coming about five chapters before it happens."
3,"Good Grisham, but a bit wordy","Decent Grisham tale of Patrick Lanigan, the law partner who faked his own death and stole $90 million from his firm. As in any Grisham novel, he creates firm characters and a great story. This one gets a bit wordy, but overall, it's not bad."
2,Not worth the time it took to read.,"This book is a poor attempt for Grisham. The story had many holes, and the ending appeared to be so rushed as to not fit the story at all."
2,Formula Writing At Its Worst,"The Partner is formula writing at its worst. Throw in a hero, the requisite bad guys, the requisite romance, and bingo...another bestseller. Only this bestseller has a long way to go. The beginning was intriguing and I thought Grisham was finally going to get it right. But the book lost steam with every page and the ending was the biggest letdown in any book I've ever read. Formula writing CAN be superb...a la Mary Higgins Clark..but Grisham just doesn't click."
1,Grisham at his worst.,"This is the first Grisham novel I've read that I've been thoroughly disappointed with. So many aspects of the book were utterly predictable -- whether he was a murderer, the body actually being a corpse, and so much more. I didn't expect the book to have a happy ending; I thought he'd end up in jail, or something. And yet everything went exactly his way...right up to the last page. I've never been made more miserable by an ending. The story was mediocre at best, and the ending destroyed it."
3,not his best work.,I normally enjoy Grisham books but I found this one to be dull with a conclusion that was both rushed and expected.I don't suggest it unless you are REALLY into legal jargon and don't mind an ending that could only have been done in such a way because he anticipated writing a second book about this character.
3,Nothing special,"A lawyer fakes his death and runs off to Brazil with much of the partnership's funds. They search for him for years and finally find them. However, it turns out that he still has a few tricks and machinations up his sleeve with respect to starting afresh for a second time.Having read this several years ago, this is pretty much all I remember so it's not that memorable. A decent story but didn't stick in my mind."
4,Fast Paced from Page 1.....,"This was an outstanding book. It was very exciting, suspenseful, and dramatic. I thought that it was not quite as good as The Firm but definately up there with the rest of Grisham's books. Even though Patrick had done a terrible thing I still sympathized with him, and I am not usually with the 'bad guy', but I realy wanted Patrick to live in his little dream world."
3,"Interesting, very Interesting!?","I once said that I am not an avid fan of JG, and this book did not affect that statement. I got through the first chapter, which is pretty good for a high school student, and was quite impressed. I really thought that this book was going to be really thrilling-I chalk that statement up to bad taste and inexperience. The idea of a person getting away from his pathtetic, dull life and stealing a truck load of money was really cool, the way Grisham persued made it rather boring. Patrick was a really awesome character with lots of tricks up his sleeve and was probably the only thing that kept my attention. Despite popular opinion, I thought the ending was hype"
3,Nice and predictable,"John Grisham is a master of legal thriller. Reading is very nice until the end, when it happens what the reader predicts. Unpredictable is the missing of Eva."
2,"Well, its almost worth reading...","Grisham writes entertaining novels, but I finished this one and kind of wished that I hadn't wasted my time. Hey, Michael Jordan can have a bad game, so Grisham can write a stinker or two...."
2,A dissapointment,"The main character, Patrick Lanigan is very difficult to like. Unlike Grisham's former main characters who had a valiant purpose, Lanigan performs the opposite. Skip this one and read The Firm or The Rainmaker."
4,A very inspiring novel. I admire Patrick's life.,"Patrick Lanigan was the symbol of everyones dreams. For an example, his friend Karl wanted to be Patrick adn just run away with no cares in the world. I also admire his ability to play the system like he did. He had a play for everything they threw at him and he walked away a free man. I can only dream of such things. Overall I liked the novel very much. It was well written and the suspense was wonderful."
2,Very disappointing!,"I think that John Grisham must be getting tired - this book is the most boring one and I have read all of his novels - I kept waiting for it to get interesting and it never happened. The only thing I learned was how to move money around the world - that is if I ever get any money to move around the world! The characters were never developed and the final thought on this one was ""who cares"""
3,Grisham insults the reader's intelligence,"The partner spoon feeds the reader with the actions of theprotagonist. The reader definitely stays the reader and is notallowed to become part of the action. No clues are given regarding the ""dead"" body, until Grisham says Viola'....He must have thought the reader would not have been able to follow simple plot lines, because there are few and feeble when presented. ^MGrisham needs to write for the fever in him, not for the money. He is capable...has done it before. Come back John."
2,Overrated !,"My first Grisham and was I excitedRead the book but boy, I was truly dissapointed!Tried to read on just to finish the endingIs this the type of book this popular author is writing?Not one of his best, some reviewers commentYou better believe it, wait for the movie instead.The surprise(?) ending gives us a lessonHate to reveal it but it has something to do with treason!So for you out there who's reading this reviewIt's your choice to buy or pass, this is just my point of view..."
4,The Partner is an intriguing adventure.,"This book is not one of Grisham's best, but I found it to be anenjoyable, interesting read. I really enjoyed the legal manueveringof Patrick and Eva (particularly Patrick's ease of getting the Federal charges dropped against him).I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read John Grisham, but warn them that it's not the heart-stopping suspense we are all used to."
2,"A quick, empty read","This book is an empty, substance-less story more that would fitbetter on an NBC Movie of the Week than in a book. It takes too longto read a plot that goes nowhere fast! When Grisham does move the plot he does it interestingly, but he does it so slowly that it becomes predictable, dull, and downright boring. The only intelligence sets in during the last chapter when Grisham seems to wax philosophically. Other than that - wait for the movie that I'm sure will be coming soon!"
3,It's the same book again!,"I read the Firm, The Chamber, The Client, andThe Runaway Jury. What do you get when youmix The Firm and The Runaway Jury together? THE PARTNER!"
4,"Great book, One of his best","This was an overall good book.It has the suspense that makes you not want to put it down.The plot is great- A man who steals 90 million dollars from his law firm and dissapears.I really didn't like the ending because it just stops. Anyway, it was one of his best."
3,Predictable ending,John Grisham is an excellent writer with frequent unexpectedtransitions. The plot of The Partner is not up to par with his otherwritings. The end is very predictable about half way through the book and it takes the excitement out of reading it. One finishes the book only to see if they were right or wrong.
5,"Excellent, exciting, a page turner from beginning to end",Grisham captures the essence of details that are riviting. You want to know what's next and next... I give this book an excellent rating. Defintely his Best!
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Having trouble sleeping? Try The Partner. The only reason I finished it is because I paid good money for the book. Other than that, it was one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters were poorly developed and the plot was a complete bore. And I saw the Eva twist coming early on. I'm just glad I waited to buy it in paperback because I sure would have hated to waste $20-plus on this one."
3,"Very interesting, however, very unrealistic...","I enjoyed the book, it kept me on edge. It was unpredictable and exciting. However, there's no way it all could come together so perfectly...just how he planned it. Not even Superman could've pulled that off."
3,Page-turning writing that races you to an irritating ending.,"Grisham creates a cunning, yet likeable Patrick Lanigan, pilots him through unforgetable twists and turns and throws it all in with an ending so irritatingly unfulfilling I wanted to rewrite it for him. His works are great and THE FIRM proves that his talent surpasses anything of his level, but THE PARTNER is an overall disappointment."
2,Mediocre compared with early Grisham.,"The thin plot and predictable story line of The Partner made it only average among other, earlier works by Grisham. The characters were static! Only the fluid, easily read writing of Grisham made this book bearable. It is at best a recreational read, nothing more."
2,Full of Crap,"Like all Grisham books, this one has a good start but ends quite badly. Everything is too pat as one other reviewer wrote, ""like a made for movie book"" Try reading Leon Uris."
5,The ending completed the perfect book!,This was my first John Grisham book and I have to say that it was the absolute best book I have ever read. I think that the ending made the book and it left me with the feeling that he wrote it just as it should have been written..It was a perfect ending.
3,Great story...until the end!,I just finished The Partner and wanted to scream! This book could have been great! It was suspenseful and exciting and I couldn't put it down. The ending just didn't jive with character development. I don't know what John Grisham was thinking! I was really disappointed!
4,Good Job John,"The book was a page turner, with great detial. Also, it kept you entertained without giving away the end."
1,Simplistic plot with a rotten ending,"This Grisham paperback is now in my wastebasket and I feel I've done my good deed for the day, saving someone else from reading this drivel. To me, the kiss of death for any book is my ability to summarize it in one sentence. Although many books can thus be summarized, I find that I do it only for real clinkers. This is one of them. My summary is: "" A guy disappears and is found."" I admit to a preference for happy endings. This is one of many reasons I so love Dean Koontz's books. But I don't think I dislike a less-than-happy ending IF the groundwork has been laid, or the reader can otherwise say, ""Yep, that works. Sad, but it works."" In this Grisham potboiler, NO foundation is laid anywhere for the ending, which I assume was meant to be surprising or ironic or something. ""Oops, we'll just turn things upside down for a memorable ending."" Memorable indeed."
1,"BAD, HORRIBLE, AWFUL ending!",This book was really good-until page 460! If you read this book make up your own ending-don't read Grisham's! I hope his other books don't have such a bad ending! I don't plan to read another book of his until i hear otherwise. If all his books have such an awful ending i don't plan on reading any of them! I was all excited about what would happen to Patrick and Eva- until the ending! Ruin the whole book why don't ya Grisham! I think all your book sales have gone to your head!
4,Another Grisham Success!!,"This is a real good story with a very developed plot, and very interesting in my opinion, but a bit slower read and not as much suspense, in my opinion. I liked this book a lot but thought the ending could've been better."
3,PARTNERS IN CRIME,"What do you do when you have a hero who is as antiheroic as you can get? Patrick Lanergan has stolen ninety million dollars, possibly burned someone else up in a car that was supposed to be his fiery death; hidden away for four years; and used a lovely lawyer to help him achieve his ends?Of course as the novel unwinds (and Grisham keeps your interest in spite of this quandary), we find that perhaps Patrick's motives are a lot more noble than one could imagine. Grisham populates his book with some interesting and likeable people (Sandy for instance) and some that aren't fleshed out enough to feel anything about (unfortunately this includes Eva, whose actions at the book's close are rather devastating and one couldn't see it coming).Patrick's brilliance in his scheme is to be admired, as is Grisham for concocting the whole thing. But it's soulless hero and it's rather unfair ending keep it from being a book it should have been."
4,Four & a half stars,"This was my first Grisham read...and i was pretty impressed.I think the only complaint i have would be the ending, as many before me have said. It left me dangling a little bit.The book in general left me very impressed though. It was a very interesting turn of events the way the story started to move. I ready one person thought it was predictable, maybe for veteran Grisham readers? So, I have many more of Grisham's books on my shelves and i can't wait to start reading them!"
1,"""THE DISAPPOINTMENT""","Well, the dabate is over. It IS possible to take an average but passable story and ruin it in the final two pages. I can't understand why he came up with this ending, because it doesn't even make sense. If you are into wasting your time, here's your book."
3,"Charactoristic Grisham, but dry.","If you like Grisham, I suppose this one won't let you down, but it just lacked the big-scale excitement of his others. The writing itself-description, emotions, details-are great, but really, it's just a story about lawyers using slimy tactics to avoid penalties."
3,I thought it was okay for a John Grisham book.,"I thought that the way the book was put together was neat,but I couldn't get into the book and I think that I would have ended it differently."
4,One of the best,"I thouroughly enjoyed this book and will read it again. The ideas were interesting and shows how criminals can fall through the cracks of the justice system. The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5, is because of the ending. Maybe thats a cue to the author to write The Partner II and give the readers what they want to see happen..."
1,FOURTH AND LAST,"This was my fourth and last John Grisham book. It began well enough with the hero being tortured in a South American jungle by God-knows-who. But my desire to know more about this character quickly dissolved. Like all of Grisham's characters, this one, too, was not only cliched, but mega-stupid (a la Darby Shaw in The Pelican Brief who used her credit card, for God's sake when she was being followed). The ending alone proved that. Why in the world any man with even a modicum of intelligence would ever want to see THAT witch again is beyond me. Grisham treats us likes he's writing to five-year olds and I, for one, don't like it. Goodbye, John Grisham and good riddance!"
1,Too bad you can't rate a zero.,"A complete waste of time. After several Grisham books, I am used to the fact that after reading 450 pages, you leave with the feeling that 400 of them were superfluous. Still, most have a plausible plot, even when stretched to fit that precious inch of shelf space. However, this one has a plot so ludicrous, so inane, that I felt angry at myself for wasting my time on it.Do yourself a favor and ignore this one!!"
1,The quintessential Grisham -- and that's not a good thing,"Read this book to get a feel for what nearly every other Grisham novel is like. This is a novel about a big pot of money, and characters who have no souls who are chasing it around. You won't care about the relationships--this is about dreaming what it would be like to have millions of dollars. A lotto ticket might be a better investment.I don't want to spoil the end except to say that it ends like all other Grisham books: it won't make much sense, it will be ""ironic"" in the sense that suddenly characters behave completely differently than you would have expected, and it is a ""twist"" in the sense that the author has been holding out on you and then suddenly reveals a fact you should have known all along. And, of course, it is about the money anyway. I turned the last page realizing I didn't really care about anybody in this book, I just felt, for a little while, that I was going along for a 90 million dollar ride."
1,He's on automatic,"This was a disappointing book with far too many elements in commonwith his previous lightweight entertainments:1. Young new partnerin a law firm in the south 2. Corruption within the firm involvingbig money 3. Young lawyer just incredibly clever, thinks of (almost)everything in advance 4. Young lawyer makes off with a ton ofmoney... 5. Escape to Latin America 6. Sailboat 7. Transfer offunds via wire to various off-shore banksThe last feature inparticular is interesting. Grisham has used the wire-transfer idea sooften that it is beginning to look like some sort of obsession. Thesame is somewhat true of escapes to the Caribbean or Latin Americawith gobs of money.Anyway, this is a simplistic pot-boiler withnot much suspense or risk to the hero (other than being almosttortured to death early in the book). The ending is strange,unexplained, and unsatisfying. END"
2,Grisham needs a co-author,"The Client again demonstrates that success is built upon the abysmally low standards of the American reader and the resonance engendered in that public by detailing the slime of the American legal system. The book is a tour de force of weaving together a cast of cartoon characters, farcical plot and a No Henry ending by means of talented prose. The guy can write but he demonstratively lacks anything to write about. Grisham's motto appears to be: Suspend any rational though when you read this book.His books fall into two classes: 1) Hate ""whitey"" polemics and 2) Action-Suspense without suspense but with random action.He would please me if he would join forces with another writer who had a head for story line, character development and had a logical mind. With such help, a future Grisham novel could make sense as well as have great surging prose style."
2,deceptive,"Enjoyed this book when I read it a number of years ago. It was so long ago that I had forgotten reading it. Recently, I was looking for a John Grisham book to read and saw that this was published in 2010. Fortunately, I read the Kindle sample first and realized I had already read it! It is deceptive to not post the original publishing date (2005) in the Kindle list! I looked at several other books that I knew were originally published years ago. Sometimes it lists the accurate date, other times not. This is a serious problem. I need to be able to trust Kindle to be honest about publishing dates."
3,It was somewhat believealbe and very predictable,"I really don't get into a lot of John Grisham's novels. Mainly because the story's are all the same. Southern lawyer, freash and new, attempts to overcome an evil group either a business or other law professionals. So i took a chance with The Partner. Is it believable that one guy, who changed so much physically, that could learn espeonage, a foreign language, wiring money around foreign banks, and come up with the perfect way to fake his own death, plus steal $90 million and get away with it with no real charges? Plus the ending i saw it coming halfway through. And that really pissed me off. Mainly because for all that he did and learn and do, it didn't amount to much at the end. Especially when i was rooting for him to get away to his new life."
2,Don't Listen to it On Audio Tape,You'll be so annoyed and bored with Patrick's wait and see manipulation. And the ending was tacked on and weird. Does anyone else think Grisham is as overhyped as Seinfeld?
2,"Great writing style, but I didn't like any of the characters","This was my first reading of a John Grisham novel. I like his writing style ad pacing, but this story just wasn't for me. I didn't like Patrick, I thought he was little more than a common thief. Never mind his motivations. And there's a little twist at the end that just didn't work for me. I seem to be in the great minority, but this book just didn't do a thing for me other than make me say ""I might read another of his books."""
4,The Partner by John Grisham,Captivating story and very unexpected ending. Page turner! Grisham never seems to get stale. Unique plot and interesting resolutions for the lead character's predicaments and he did have more than one! Good reading.
3,The ending was not expected,"A disappointing ending, just when everything else was working itself out. The main character should've learned about being too trusting."
3,Very good read.,"I'd recommend this book to anyone. Great read. A little different than most Grisham novels, but well done, as usual."
4,The Partner,"Interesting, fast pace and fun to read. An insight on how the law system works on an international scale to avoid tracking of an individual who ----."
4,Beware the legal eagle,"This book kept my interest throughout. It was a testament to the extremes of the legal profession. From greed to generousity. It was also a wake-up call regarding the big pharmaceutical companies and medications we take so freely just because they have FDA ""approval"". I will be more alert in my future dealings with both entities."
4,Does the ending portend a sequel?,"This book is a great read even if a tad unrealistic. However, entertaining fiction needs to be larger than life itself, right? As to the ending, while it was unsatisfactory from the protagonist's point of view, Grisham should ""finish"" the story with a sequel."
5,A Magnificent Return,"Hall and Oates are in their best form in years. The new single ""Forever for Love"" ranks with their best from the past. If you're a H&O fan, don't miss this new release."
5,Return to Splender,"Been a fan since I was a wee lad, and the maturity of this album really impresses me. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it near as much as I am. I take issue with the minor review in rolling stone magazine, which was rather snarky. This is a more jazzy Hall and Oates, and won't disappoint the H&O fan."
5,The Pros,"This is a terrific album, I think their best. Leave it to acouple of pros to hit one out of the park. Its so nice tohear a melody and good voices for a change, instead of theilliterate, tuneless junk that passes for music these days.Keep 'em coming guys!"
2,This One's Another Dud Folks!,Get Out the H20 or Private Eyes cdsif you're looking blue-eyed soul funk.This is more like folk-soulish stufffor the K-Mart crowd. Ugh! This isEven worse or not much better thanMarigold Sky. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ
5,The best CD from Hall & Oates Yet!!!,When I bought this CD it was because I had been a long time fan of Hall and Oates. What I got was a surprise. I love every single song on this CD and I can't stop playing it. The music is wonderful and the lyrics are just as good. The songs have real meaning (not like most new songs these days). My 8 year old daughter and her friends love this CD too. They sing and dance to it right along with me. (not yet old enough to be embarrassed by mom!) This is a definate must have if you like any of Hall & Oates songs!!!!
4,This is why they are favorites,"They're back. Hall & Oates present the awaited follow-up to the somewhat disappointing 1997 album ""Marigold Sky"". ""Do It For Love"" not only redeems that minor disappointment, it makes this new release worth the six-year wait. It also serves to remind me personally of why these guys became my favorites when I was a very young and impressionable 7 year-old!!Of course the favorites here are the title track and the stellar single ""Forever for You"" but the opening cut ""Man on a Mission"" is an excellent choice as an opener and another one of the great tracks. It's a 4 & 1/2-star album to be sure."
5,HALL & OATES Back To Form!!!,"I approached my purchase of this CD with some skepticism having bought ""Marigold Sky"" and feeling that it fell somewhat short of what I knew Hall & Oates were capable of. Although there were some great tracks on about half the CD, the rest of the tunes were lackluster. ""Do It For Love"", thankfully, doesn't make the mistake of repeating that pattern. It's very hard to pick a favorite, but ""Someday We'll Know"" with Todd Rundgren is amazing. For fans of Hall & Oates classic 70's sound, pre-""Voices"" and all that, this will knock your socks off. For fans of the 80's stuff, there's tunes-o-plenty for you, too. As I said, I was a fan of the 4 or 5 great tunes on ""Marigold Sky"" and there are some great tunes in that vein as well on this CD. Daryl & John should be very proud of this project and you should make every effort to add this to your collection. It's a keeper!!!"
1,Bubble and Trouble,"My Xpress went to the poubelle ( French for garbage can). After only one use, even though I sprayed it with Pam, the non-stick surface bubbled and flaked off. What a waste of hard-earned money. They must use a new one for each and every dish they create on TV. If I had read the reviews before the purchase, I would have never bought the thing. Buyer, please beware. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
2,Love/hate relationship,"I purchased this for my darling husband and it is/was a great idea; however, after accusing him of using metal utencils and him assuring me he didn't, it went into the trash. He loved it but everything stuck and the non-stick surface wore off after a few uses. It became almost impossible to clean it and I was the one who had to scrap and soak water in it to clean. I am desperately looking for another product that does what this did but with better non-stick surfaces. Any suggestions?"
1,Non stick surface is NOT nonstick.,"I see from the reviews that it was not just me being careless. The surface is awful and it scared me that I might be eating it, so I trashed the unit.Now I see on tv they are selling a new style of redisetgo. Let the buyer beware! I am sure its still crap with a new shape!Sad, because it was an excellent idea....but whoever did their nonstick surface is full of ...........well you know.Good Times Xpress Redi Set Go CookerXpress Redi Set Go Cooker w/ 4 Bonus Pans"
5,GT Xpress 101,"I recomend this product, it is as fantastic as the promotion shows. I have had no problems. Excellent product."
1,Don't waste your money,Since I purchased this some time ago I have used it once. The first thing I made was the cinnamon rolls. It says nothing about using non-stick spray. Big mistake. Even when using the cheap plastic utensil that comes with it when the rolls were removed from the xpress so was the teflon. I didn't think they used the old fashion brown teflon anymore. It's junk and not even worth the postage to get it to you.
1,Do not buy,"The first time I used both of them (ordered the two - get one ""free"" offer), the non stick surface came off. I do not want to ingest that - do you? Very disappointed - plus it is a lot smaller than appears in infomercial. Waste of time and money - threw them both out."
2,Non-stick coating is non-existent,"I purchased this item for Christmas but today sent it to the trash. Despite extreme care, using plastic lifter, generous use of Pam or other oils, food sticks every time and the item is almost impossible to clean. I would say it worked well for about the first month. We have kept using it but finally reached the point of too much frustration. This item is a very good idea but with poor execution -- it needs a very strong non-stick finish."
1,Cooking surface bubbles,"I do not recommend this product. After only 4 months of use, the cooking surface started to bubble, even though I seasoned the pan as per the directions. This product was a waste of money."
1,Total waste of money...,"Both times I have used my brand-new GT Express (following the instructions to the letter), the food was completely fused to the ""non-stick"" surface and had to be scraped out in bits and pieces, making a big mess on the counter and ruining the appearance of the food. Because of the incinerated ""crust"" fused to both the top and bottom wells, cleanup is quite a chore, too. This product is a huge disappointment and I highly recommend AGAINST purchasing it; if I could rate it ""0,"" I would."
2,Very difficult to read,"During my genealogy research I discovered that some of my ancestors were in the Klan in the very early days. This was disturbing to me and I started doing more research, coming to the conclusion that the EARLY Klan was not what it became later. I thought this book would be helpful. Presented as dramatizations of actual incidents, the book intended to promote understanding of the writer's point of view. Unfortunately, I was unable to survive the author's total absence of writing skills and just could not force myself to finish this boring book."
4,The best sports game yet created!,"I love baseball, and I am a huge fan of it. And of course, I wanted a baseball game for my PS2. Now, don't get me wrong, there are many baseball games to choose from out there. You have MVP Baseball 2003, All-Star Baseball, and the just plain stupid MLB Slugfest by Midway. Honestly, I don't know who would like the Midway sports titles, but that's another story. My point is, stacked up against all of the other baseball, title World Series Baseball 2k3 is by far the best. Yes, this game does put gameplay way ahead of presentation, but does that matter? The graphics are passable, but the gameplay is out of this world! When I had All-Star Baseball 2003, the game was fun, but I rarely played, and when I did, I found myself quitting the game after maybe four or five innings. WSB 2k3 was playale for ages. I play probably two games a day now. I love it that much! It is another superb title from Sega Sports, and should be bought by any baseball lover. My Rating-9.1."
4,No question - this game is the best out there...,"Thankfully I rented High Heat, which many say is the best game out there. There is simply no competition - World Series 2K3 blows this title away in every respect.As someone who was driven away from baseball games by the bazooka home runs and intelligence-insulting ease of Triple Play a few years back, I can honestly say that World Series 2K3 is the game we've been waiting for since Tony Larousa on SEGA. The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is smooth, and the Franchise/stat tracking is solid. Finally there's a baseball game with the same realism of Madden.When the only thing you'd change about a game is its use of the analog stick over the directional pad, you've got a game you can stick with. You won't be disappointed with this purchase."
4,"I don't usally like Treat Williams, but...","He was good for a little comic relief, ""It was just a little piece man, didn't hardly have any taste."" Ugh, until Steve came along. I thought it would have the Warren Zevon song in it though, nevermind Kudos to Cristopher Walken and William Forsythe"
4,"GREAT FILM NAMES, GREAT PACE.","They must have liked the script and great characters as Jimmy The Saint, Franchise, E-Z Winn and Mr. Shush. Andy Garcia, Christopher Walken, Steve Buscemi and others decided to forego their usual paydays to act in this now indie classic. THINGS TO DO IN DENVER is a great paced, extremely likeable film. The most fervent work is turned in by Treat Williams, as psychotic Critical Bill, and the major cool, Walken as the wheelchair bound, Man With The Plan (Jenny McCarthy as his nurse). Jack Warden old-pros his way by semi-narrating the tale of a group of misbegotten criminals and their impending doom. I'd buy at the Thick 'N' Rich anyday. Boat drinks all around!"
2,One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen,"Save for the outstanding performance by Christopher Walken, this movie is bad in every way. The storyline has so many unneccessary diversions in it's a mess. Characters are often silly and stereotypical. Their relationships are underdeveloped and left me confused. Like someone said before, it really tries to be hip with its catchphrases but they didn't work. And oh yeah, why the hell would someone base a gangster movie in Denver of all places?"
5,"Don't ask for the ""buckwheat"" pancakes...","See the movie, and you'll understand the reference. An often overlooked movie that has a lot of special acting roles. A MUST see for any one who likes crime/gang/ action/drama/love movies. Wonderful work by A Garcia, and Chris Walken is memorably evil as the ""Man with the Plan"". All around great flick - you'll be quoting lines from this one for a while, and Gabrielle Anwar - wow! ""Boat Drinks"" for all!"
3,video purchase,"The video arrived in good shape and in a reasonable amt of time. I was disappointed with the fact that it does not fill my screen: it is a wide screen version, but it has a large border that makes it abt half the size it could be on my tv."
4,This is must have for gangster movie collectors. Stylish,"This movie is stylishly shot with an impeccable performance from the cast.Great performances from Jack Warden, A.Garcia,Treat Williams, Chris Walken.The narrative is awesome. If you liked Suicide Kings(crap) you'll love this."
3,4 stars if you really like dark comedy,"I dont think the people who gave this a bad review get it...its a comedy; not Goodfellas. How long would a paralyzed man last at the head of a real mafia family. Its a comedy folks...like when they refer to Christopher Walken as ""the HEAD"" because he is paralyzed from the neck down. Once again I think Chris Walken steals the show...he is real funny in this movie. And Treat Williams who I never really liked, I thought did a very good job. If you like dark comedy, then you will understand the punching bag scene. If you don't like dark comedy, I would stear clear of this one."
5,Dandy Andy!,"This movie is what makes Andy Garcia so cool, and he doesn't do it by acting with his hair. Although they could have picked someone better than Gabrielle Anwar, Garcia made it believable. Christopher Walken as the psycho boss-man was brilliant. Clearly, this movie didn't get the hype that it deserved. It's one to watch over and over again and well worth the money to own!"
5,Like seeing the world from space for the first time,"John Taylor Gatto writes a damming tour-de-force. I attended 13 years of public schooling, five of college, and with degrees under my belt now I see the school as it is, how we felt in our hearts it was before we became numb to its effects: An inefficient, potentially dangerously designed factory built to steal the prime years of young American's lives and produce a homogenous mush of a citizenry. My children will never set foot in a public school to be beaten into some pre-determined shape by a union flunky with no oversight; they will be educated, not schooled. Homeschooling, tutors, maybe a charter school, but never ever will my kids feel the soft evil of the brick-and-steel children's prison called State Public School."
2,Neil Postman he ain't,"I wanted to like this book. I had a rough time with public factory-style permission-to-urinate-denied ""wut parentz?"" schooling and I agree with much of Gatto's assessment. But I have trouble believing this book amounts to right-wing agit-prop, or maybe just Old Fart-isms, enveloping some worthwhile history (e.g., his section on the Gary plan)--history that Gatto unfortunately mixes with self-admittedly ""speculative"" narrative--and Gatto's actual sympathy for children and education."
5,You'll get an education just by reading this book,"This is the best book on the subject of schooling I've ran into. I absolutely love this book. He presents evidence to prove his points very clearly. I find his history very accurate, although I'm not an ""expert."" I would really like anyone to challenge this book just to see if it can be done.The previous review misses the point completely, especially the one that says this book endorses hitting. I question whether that reviewer read any of the book. This book is a work of pure passion and intellect. Even if you hate the subject of education and want to fall asleep whenever the subject comes up, you would find this book fascinating.I think he's my hero. I wish this were written 15 years ago."
5,The untold history of education,"The book goes into much detail that the educrats would rather ignore and information that the overwhelming majority of teachers are likely unaware about.Only a little is speculative, and that is pretty well founded.It gives credence to the idea that much of education is only window-dressing and, for higher education, merely bragging rights."
2,Poorly edited mess with glimmers of interest,"This book may have been revolutionary in 1942 but today it seems to strain to argue points that most Americans readily accept. It also tends to be incredibly choppy, with thoughts coming and going like bad housegeusts. Lastly, it has all the faults one would expect to find in Montagu: he sacrificed his science for politics, and thus there are many times where he wildy exhorts his point of view or uses ad homineim's against his opponents. The reason is the book was not written to explore a phenomena, but to convince people that some things are wrong and other right morally. So his science suffers. However, there are glimmers of intelligent ideas and devastating studies that derode the basis of 'race thinking.'"
1,lost item,I did not receive this product yet. Very disappointed in the mail system or businessness of Holiday shopping.
3,not her best by a long shot,"This has an orchestrated feel and back-up vocals. It just doesn't do her justice or reflect her grit or soulfulness. You would do much better with the eponymous Jo Ann Kelly, Do It and More, Jo Ann, or many other 5 star CDs by one of the best female blues vocalists ever and a great bottleneck guitar player. Jo Ann Kelly with John Fahey is particularly tasty if you can find it."
5,Brilliant and Lighthearted,Those cool critters and Sandra's sparkling wit make this one of my favorite books of all time. I've run into every one of the turkey prototypes during my life. Brilliant.
1,Not very funny at all,"I was under the impression, from the front and back covers, that this might be a somewhat humourous look into silly people. I found, unfortunately, that it was quite boring and uninspiring, and not very informative at all."
1,this book is awful!,like the other person said it looks like the first draft right out of the guys typewriter! i took a year of greek and this isnt helpful-the way its organized you cant use it for fast reference. the guy cant even write complete sentences.
3,"Pleasant, but not grabbing",This is a pleasant story but not one my son likes to watch over and over as he does the Larryboy episodes.
4,Wonderful Video,"Madame Blueberry is great. Not only does it teach children great values about God, but it also has a funny intermission called 'Love Songs With Mr. Lunt'. Great movie for kids of all ages."
5,Funny and spiritually educational...,"Funny accents, great animation, Christian plot, colorful scenes, cute characters, it's all in this movie! Madame Blueberry is a selfish berry, who needs to learn how to be content with what she has. How? Let's just say this is only something Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber can do! In no time, you'll have the catchy songs, funny lines, and spiritual message memorized, and you'll know that a thankful heart is the one that's happy."
5,I'm 20 and I love it,"We bought this DVD for my 13-month-old cousin, and I get more excited about it than she does. However, she does love it. Her face just lights up when she hears the intro, and she dances along to all of the songs. The message of ""Thankfulness"" is expressed in a way that anyone of any age can understand and gain appreciation from. If your children already has a ""gazillion"" toys and are still begging for more, sit them down in from of this video."
5,Favorite Veggie movie,This should be in the video collection of every person who has a blackbelt in shopping.
5,Proof through Physics - excellent!,"This is one book, which if you understand physics and math, will prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that the moon's gravity is not 1/6th of Earths...Strongly suggest a video copy of the NASA Appolo missions..."
5,Well Worth Taking the Chance on the Expense,"I am glad I purchased the Japanese import since the 2 bonus tracks are also good and not merely sales enticing filler. I would rate this up there with Peggy Suicide, my favorite Cope release. A definite welcome addition to my collection that already included Jehovakill, Autogeddon, 20 Mothers, and the aforementioned Peggy Suicide. There is enough pop musicality in here that you could probably even get away with playing this with a normal person in the room and they would not know that you were secretly trying to indoctrinate them into the circle of the Arch-Druude. But it still has the quirks and tangents to make it a uniquely Copian release. This is the kind of music that U2 or REM dream about making."
2,1000 count sheets,"the sheets arrived promptly. I am disappointed in the size, though-- the length is generous, but they are not wide enough to tuck in at the sides."
1,Very disappointed,These sheets survived maybe three weeks before pilling up. They feel like sandpaper after only two washes! Unbelievably poor. You're better off with whatever the cheapest purchase is that's available at Walmart instead of these.
2,SHEETS,"WRINKLE BADLY, SO BAD YOU CAN'T GET THE WRINKLES OUT UNLESS YOU IRON, NOT JUST PRESS THE SHEETS"
2,Didn't last 6 months,"I've had pretty good luck in the past buying 1000 thread count sheets on-line, but these sheets got those little thread balls all over them after the first washing. I was really disappointed in these sheets. I've been using them for 4 months, but I hate the feeling of the fabric now. I gave it two stars only because it has a lower price than most, but I guess you get what you payy for."
3,"Rainbow lines 1,000 thread count sheets","Very nice sheets however, do agree with another reviewer these sheets have slightly balled after the fourth wash in (cold) water, only inside line drying is ever used.I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Truncated Compact Disc,"Originally released on CD as ""Friends""/""20-20"" with bonus tracks, this is now ""Friends"" only without the bonus tracks or track by track annotation by David Leaf. Reportedly Brian Wilson's favorite album because you do not have to get into a certain mood to hear it. Is more of a Beach Boys album with a more balanced contribution from all of the members. Capitol needs to re-release the full CD with ""20-20"" along with the bonus tracks, otherwise the album will be over before you know it."
3,Very Tranquil Album,"The album is not Pet Sounds but it is still good. It shows Dennis Wilson's artistic flowering with Little Bird and Be Still . It has soothing songs like Passing By and Diamond Head and of course, Friends. It is sad that Friends did not make it in the turmoil of 1968"
4,A Deadly Interest,"I really enjoyed this book. I love a good mystery, one that keeps me up reading all night because I can't put it down. This book did that for me. I had to know who the murderer was, and what would happen next! I started this book with no knowledge of Native American tradtions or lifestyles. I now want to know more. The main character is learning at the same time as the reader is learning. This makes it very easy for any reader to follow along. The characters in this book were described very well by the author. She makes you care about the characters. You feel their emotions. As the reader, you get to look into the relationships of parents and children, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, and young lovers. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to be kept on the edge of the seat. Very well written."
1,"Don't buy this one, you'll be disappointed",This is the worst decision I've made in purchasing consumer electronics. It is not worth the money. The quality is quite ppor and the hype about persormance is just that - HYPE. I should have returned it but for the moment it is in my garage under an inch of dust.
2,Not a bad album but HORRENDOUS mastering!,It's not the album that is bad it is the non-clarity of sound! I guarantee this is not how it sounded in the control room. If you listen carefully it sounds like it was recorded in another room! None of the sonic details are there! What a travesty of a transfer in this day and age. Shame on the record company. Where's the remastered series?
1,Excalibur is Dull,"Game seems like a good idea, but the manufacturer didn't pull it off. Shoot down enemy planes within 30-sec of play and then fly around forever trying to find where to land. Poor instructions."
2,pyramid mx3 BB set,"this bottom bracket set is cheaply made ' bearings grind in bearing cup's which rip away at the chrome plating which in turn wear out the bearings' sounds like gravel in b-b , I replaced the cup's & bearings within a week , but you get what you pay for , could use some spacers also but for the price its worth the it for the use of the spindle & other parts ."
5,Very Easy to setup,Bought this flash and grip for my fuji s7000. could'nt find one that was specific to this camera but tried this anyway. Results were very very good - night and day difference from using built in flash and set up was very straight forward. Plus side I did'nt have to worry about other flashes having voltage issues or needing adapters. Flash is very quick to be on the ready status - still playing with it to see how long battery lasts but otherwiswe excelent purchase. Took a while to get here but the wait was worth it.
2,It's alright,"I agree with another comment that the button on the side of the handle is to easy to accidentally press and change the mode unknowingly. When using with the Canon PowerShot S3 IS, I found it doesn't work with the manual settings I prefer. You have to still use the pop-up flash to trigger the slave. Maybe a diffuser to eliminate the effects of the pop-up will impove the results.While it does what it said it would do, in order to do what I want to do, I need to upgrade my whole system. If I want to be professional, I need a professional system. This is okay for now while I'm getting my studio business back up and running."
1,A piece of junk,"I admit it: I made the fool with this item, pure garbage. It is the worst item I ever purchased in the net."
5,Exllante!,"Chere Amazon, Grande orivua! Je deteste le countess! Je hope madmomselle Francine Pascal will write more orivua!"
4,The book would be good if anna were not in it,Anna needs to stop throwing tantrums and salvador needs to shut u
2,"""oh,he's my boyfriend!""","Jessica is having trouble fitting in at jr high as hard as that is to believe.She isn't the type to have that kind of trouble.Anyway,she tells cooler-than-thou Lacey that that boy over there is her boyfriend.Really it is Steven,her brother!!!!!!When Lacey finds out the truth,will Jess ever live it down????This is a pretty blah series and I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Great new Book series.,"No offense to the author but i think that the sweet valley twins and the sweet valley twins and friends boooks were pretty lame. But this serie is like so cool. I heaerd about this book from one of my friends and as soon as i got ""get real"" i read it like 50 times it was so good. Then i got One 2 many and it was great. But then i read 3rd one i have to addimet it was preety boring consderi i loved the frist one. but i really liker this sereie and i hope this goes up till they gradute jr high. Keep up the good work francine!!"
3,Uhhhhh.......,I liked this book alot. It's also intresting how they show the book from Jessica and Elizabeth's point of view. For those of you who are still wondering I think that Tim is Anna's dead older brother. Even though the book was good it was still kinda unrealistic. What are the chances that only Jessica and Elizabeth are transfered. And what happened to The old hangouts? And I thought that Jr high was a new school and if so how come that woman has been working there for years. Confusing but apart from that it's a really good book.
1,Not Pleased.,I have also worked in the industry for many years and I must say that this book is very poor. It would really help the author and his students if he took the time to focus more on the current technology of todays printing industry. This book would have been a hit if it was written in 1970.
5,Wargaming and Diplomacy Fans Should Buy This!,"Well, for all of you Diplomacy players looking for some variety from the doldroms of WW1-era conflict, and for all all wargamers looking for something a bit different, Colonial Diplomacy provides a refreshing alternative. Players assume the role of a colonial power in the historical period between the Opium Wars and the Russo-Japanese War, struggling for dominance on a huge and complex map. While minor game balance issues exist (i.e. The Japanese Empire is the strongest on the board by a not insubstantial margain), Colonial Dip. deserves a place on the shelves of Dip. players, history buffs, and wargamers alike."
3,Not the best Diplomacy variant,"I think Diplomacy enthusiasts should pick up a copy of this one, even though it's not the best variant (and is certainly not better than the original game). Colonial is played on a much bigger map (all of Asia from the Black Sea east) and develops more slowly and less intensely than the original game. It also lacks the original's refinement, so that certain powers are more disadvantaged than others (Britain begins spread out all over the place, France is tiny, etc.) and the map lends itself to stalls. Learning the map takes a lot of time, since geography classes tend to leave out places like Akmolensk. This is the primary hinderance to the game: having to keep track of the provinces when you go out of the room to negotiate. Still, this is an interesting alternative to the original and should be tried at least once by fans of the game. If you're not sure, I recommend playing a game on one of the email servers before buying."
4,More Than Santa Claus,"Keisha and her younger brother Tony go downtown with the Boys Club to look at theChristmas decorations in the windows of the downtown stores. During their walk,Tony asks a lot of questions about Christmas, Jesus, and the meaning behind many holidaytraditions. Keisha, still a child herself, answers the questions as best she can asthe two discuss the true meaning of Christmas.Ford's illustrations are simply beautiful and are a nice accompaniment to this cutestory. If you are looking for a book that provides an accurate Biblical account of Jesusand his birth then this is probably not the book for you. But if you are looking for afeel good story, which highlights the special relationship between siblings and presentsthe story of Christmas from a child's point of view, then this book is a worthy additionto any child's library.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
4,Reflects some children's lives,Some may not like the grammer and some may not like children's book talking about things like evictions. But this book will open discussions with your child about the true meaning of Christmas when you can discuss the real ways many children have to live. Many families celebrate Christmas as the birth of christ and for those children this book will be a welcome addition.
1,Not a book to nourish a child's christian reading abilities.,"The illustrations were beautiful, however I was very displeased with the grammar used in this book. Children are like sponges and therefore it's terrible for them to hear grammar such as ""we got"", ""yup"" and ""tell me 'bout."" I also found it unnecessary for one of the child characters in the book to discuss being evicted and her daddy being unable to find them a place to stay. The book states that Christmas is Jesus' birthday, when in fact that is not true. Since this is a book about Jesus, it should not state that one of the characters were ""lucky"" to have received some money. It should state that the child was ""blessed."" Finally, I would suggest alternate reading material for a child learning more about Jesus and proper grammar."
2,Disappointing - not worth the money,"This is not an instructional video to teach you about mosaics. It is nothing more than a recast of their 30-minute TV show where you watch two people create a mosaic table. They talk very fast at times due to the short amount of time. I bought this TO LEARN, for more detailed explanation on the how and why rather than just watching excerpts of time-lapsed work and hearing about how brilliant they are. I expected more from well-known names in the industry and feel that they are taking advantage of their reputation to charge full price for a TV recast and pretend it is an instructional video. The DVD is worth something, but certainly not the price they are asking. If you want a good stained glass video, check out Michael Dupille's Beginning Fritography. That is excellent!!"
5,"Fabulous Cookbook, A must reprint","This book is so well written, has such glorious photos and receipes that it is criminal that it is out of print. Anyone who cooks in a second home or on a boat or RV should have a copy. I have never found a bad receipe in it. If you read William Buckley's ""Racing Through Paradise"" the meals he raves about are Liz Wheeler's creations and the receipes are in this book."
4,good but not perfect,"Love the way these fill in the gap in the wheel wells, but they do need to specify that there made to fill in the gap after doing a body lift. The rubber doesn't clear the shock mount and after looking at a friends' truck with a body lift and these they fit perfect on his. I love the way these look just wish they would of been notched right for a none body lifted truck."
1,not a good one,"My 3 yr old son loves veggie tales, however, I am very dissapointed with this one. In the beginning larry is in a cafe, it is late at night and the cafe is empty, he is sitting at a table crying hitting his head on the table, the waiter, says hey buddy are you okay? And it just gets worse from here. The wallowing in crying, and sadness continues throughout the entire movie. It takes places, the entire movie, while larry cries sitting at this booth, reflecting on past veggie tales episodes played on the restaurant juke box, the past epsisodes are good, but my son couldn't get past, momma Larry sad. What's wrong momma? It was not a good veggie tale. So basically this movie is a bunch of snippets of other veggie tales movies w/Larry crying in between the snippets at a restaurant booth hitting his head on the table."
3,Great veggie concept but a little too weird for me,"I loved the absurdity of the concept -- talking, dancing, wisecracking vegetables -- and my son finds the idea of the video hilarious. Unfortunately, he is much less interested in actually watching it. I think that he, like I, found the animation to be a bit busy; the songs hard to follow out of context; and the whole thing somewhat bizarre. Our lukewarm response to the video may be because it is a compilation of songs excerpted from other videos, with which we aren't familiar. I did not realize that this was a Christian video series when I purchased it, as the box doesn't clearly identify its religious themes. I suspect that those who consider themselves born-again will welcome this aspect of the series, while others may find the religious tone (e.g. Bible-based plot lines, direct references to God) a little hard to take."
4,Last part of the lost puzzles,I bought the other 3 puzzles and so bought this as the finish one of them. Enjoyed making them and gives you insight into the programme. If you like lost you will like these puzzles also gives you a 'secret'.
3,NOT TYPICAL ANN MURRAY,"WE WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD. THE QUALITY AND THE SINGING DID NOT REPRESENT THE PAST CDS OF HER THAT WE OWN. THIS LADY IS A GREAT TALENT, BUT IT IS NOT DEMONSTRATED ON THIS CD."
5,Excellent Anne Murray.,"One of her best albums in my opinion. Track 13, Good Again, is particularly interesting, both touching and ""up-beat"" at the same time. Very well done. If you like Anne Murray, you'll like this album."
2,Disappointed,"I was really happy when I finally found them. We bought the Chicco flip'n'play earlier, which comes with 14 great Chicco blocks, all in different shapes and my 9 months old loved to play with them - and we built all kind of things together. I wanted to enlarge our options and ordered (waited forever, which is not part of my product review! but anyway) these blocks, assuming that they have at least some different sizes, allowing more creativity, but these 36 pieces only come in 3 shapes - 2x2 blocks, 3 pieces 2x6 bridge shape and about 4 pieces 2x2 with an angle on top (for roofs). So I am a little disappointed.On the bag are printed some different shapes. But unfortunately, they are not in there and I couldn't find some extension sets with other sizes."
3,Disappointed,"After much excitement about ordering these, I was disappointed because they did not interlock like other maxi blocks. These just sit on top of each other, so when one falls, they all fall apart individually instead of in sections. My kids play some, but I think they would enjoy them more if they actually locked together. And I would enjoy the clean up better for sure!"
5,Fun for Little Ones!,"While nothing beats wood blocks (in my opinon) we had these first, and they are fun! We like that they are flexible and easy for little hands to manipulate, and not painful if they fall on you! The only downside is that they are large, and storing them in the bag is like putting together a puzzle-they JUST fit. Storing them in a toy box fills the box with wasted space; so we stack them in 4 rows beside the toy box. It's worth the hassle if you have space for them and don't mind stacking them up and teaching your little one to."
5,my girls LOVE it!,"purchased it 2 years ago for my older daughter, she loved it!now my both 3 and 5.5 years old daughters play with those blocksevery day!!! it's colorfull, durable, easy to build, many pieces!A bit pricey, but i could not find any close cheaper alternative."
3,Geordi Has A Girlfriend? Not really!,"One of the quieter storlines going through most of the NG seven year run is LaForge's lack of success with women. It seems that the only place he can find a good woman that likes him is on the holodeck.This is when he met the beautiful Ms. Brahms. He had used an image of her on the holodeck in an earlier episode to help him with a technical problem. He gave her a warm personality which suited his desires.In this episode he finally meets her. But she is somewhat cold and distant, and he soon learns she is married, which naturally crushes him.He is humiliated when she discovers the saved program that Geordi created. The storyline that accompanies it is somewhat interesting, and some would say uplifting.I would give this episode 4 stars, but 3 is a better fit. It just seems to miss something that the series is so rich in. But if you are a Geordi LaForge fan, this is a must-have episode."
4,Can't stop the punk rock,"This is the album that started Billy's solo career in America. There are only 4 songs on this cd/EP. Two of the tracks are actually repeats of songs he did with Generation X- ""Dancing With Myself"" and ""Untouchables"", one is a cover song, ""Mony Mony,"" and the last song (the only new song) is ""Baby Talk."" ""Dancing With Myself"" oddly enough has the same vocal track as the Gen X version but is performed by new musicians. This version is also shorter and has less rock n roll punk rock guitar than the original. The ""Untouchables"" has new vocals and is also performed by new band. It has less ""bite"" though than the Gen X version. ""Baby Talk"" is a fun pop song and is also the song that Billy would start his concerts with in the early 80's. The interview with Martha Quinn is fun to listen to. If you were wondering why he chose to cover ""Mony Mony"" or what his real name is, you're in for a surprise. I have the cassette tape and the record version of this album-and now I've got the cd."
3,"More a ""Hard-Core Fan Only"" CD","This album only has four songs on it, it being an EP and all, so you're not going to get a lot of bang for your buck, especially when one of the songs is ""Dancing With Myself"" and another is ""Mony Mony"" (both of which you can find on more expansive Idol albums). The other two songs are enjoyable: ""Baby Talk"" is extremely catchy despite not being all that great of a song, and ""Untouchables"" is a cool remake of a song he did with his old band, Generation X. But the only thing that really makes this album worth buying is for the Martha Quinn (one of the original MTV VJs) and Billy Idol interview. Although Idol says a few funny things (including something I don't think I'm allowed to print here), it's still nothing more than a novelty. In other words, this is an enjoyable EP, but don't break the bank buying it."
4,Dont Stop- Buy Me!,I really enjoyed this cd-the music is brilliant-couldnt be better. If you have tried this author before then you will enjoy this one!
3,Limited songs but ok,This is marketing at its best with interview with Martha of MTV...I get it as it was the 80s and VJs talking to stars was big...songs ok.
3,Some of the early stuff. Not yet too popish...still core,"I've had this when this was an album. if you an IDOL fan it's a definite MUST HAVE in the collection.A lot of the tunes are not as 'mainstream' as what he has been puttin' out, so if u like the old style PUNK/NEW-WAVE days. Get this.If not, still get it because it's a good one to have in the collection. enjoy!"
5,Coolest game ever !,This game is so cool ! the graphics are soooo good. The funky disco tunes are worth the $ by itself. The cars are so realistic you will forget it is just a game.
1,HOUSEFIRE KILLS GOLDFISH,"I recently had a housefire, almost everything was ruined, including my pc games. I moved back in and now i bought the game again and i love it! This game is the best. If ur looking for a sweet game, this is one! OHMYGOD MY PET GOLDFISH DIED AND NOW I MUST EAT RED MEAT! OHMYGOD"
4,good read,I enjoyed reading this book about an otherwise obscure part of history. Her writing style i found easy to read and drew me into the stories
3,A bit gonzo,"I found this a bit gonzo: harsh and loud, and aggressive. I much prefer Olivier Baumont's set on WCJ, available for about the same price, but more varied and eloquent.Couperin: Complete Works for Harpsichord"
2,A very average book,"I bought this book for a class at a university. It was an easy read and easy to understand, but not overly interesting. It is a typical sociology book. Most people who buy this book will be students required to purchase it for class. However, if you are the rare person considering this book as an addition to your library, I suggest rethinking your decision. I suspect that the people who find this subject matter interesting already know everything in the book. It is written on a very basic level.If you are looking for a book to improve your marriage, look elsewhere. This book offers theoretical ways to have a successful relationship, but like too many sociology books it has little practical relevance. For example, this book teaches that a successful relationship will have optimal balances of cohesion, flexibility and communication. While that principal is probably correct the application is vague."
1,Conservative and Boring,"I had to use this book for class. It is a extremely simplistic book that reads much more like a high school text then something intended for college. It was generally uninteresting. The authors are obviously fairly traditional in their views of family relationships and the whole text seems out of date for today's society. There was no information in this book that isn't just common sense. Also, there was an over emphasis on the positive of family relationship, which though warm a fuzzy, is not particularly relevant or helpful. I spoke to the department chair at my college about this book and they will not be requiring it next year."
3,Good service,"The books seem to be stored for a long time, covers are quite dirty. However, the books are acceptable. The postage service is great."
2,Too urgent for replacement,I have ordered eight copies of the book as above. The package arrived in time for our class and came in two sets which were slightly damaged by the four corners and the books are filled with mildewy smell. Since we need the book urgently so we have to accept them.
3,"It was about, talked about military stuff.",I think the book was boring. I didn't like it one bit. All it talked about was military stuff. I don't like that. But it has some interesting stuff of what goes on under military servicing.
3,Meh.,"Perhaps Textures are at an unfair disadvantage, as my favorite bands include Meshuggah, Coprofago, and Ephel Duath. I bought this disc expecting some zany math-metal, and instead got a math-powerpop-metal cd.These guys manage some good mathy riffs here and there, but there's way too much of the Def Leppard vibe going on, too. That is, of course, an exaggeration, but as a fan of the aforementioned groups, I cannot help making the comparison.The ""metal lite"" outweighs the real metal here, and the horrible, teen-friendly vocals rear their head more often than the jens-kidman-worthy grit.If you want a kinder, gentler Meshuggah, this band is for you. If you're a dyed-in-the-wool math-metaller, you may want to pass it up."
4,"I agree, except","It was great at the time to purchase this and peruse the enlcosed booklet while enjoying the plethora of music (each CD has more than 15 songs). My only pan about the collection is how some songs are cut short--just when you're getting into them, for whatever reason, Chrysalis/Ian Anderson/whomever fades out the song."
5,"Evocative, poignant, heart-rending, and sexy!",I can't say enough about this outstanding love story! THE KEEPER is unforgettable and Margot Early reminds us why she is one of the brightest rising stars of contemporary romance. -- Laura DeVrie
3,Quick Read- Layman Oriented,"This book is a quick read- one sitting & is perfect for the layman or the newly diagnosed. This book is not a good resource, however, for those who are already educated in the healthcare arena. Sticky Blood is written in a conversational and `chatty' tone, which lends to the approachability but left me hoping for more concrete fact-based information. As a matter of personal preference, I would have enjoyed a book that challenged me to live well and expect more; not to just yield to the assistance of `tablets' and energy conservation tactics. In summary- I'm thankful someone wrote a book about this topic that is friendly and easy to read, but I'll be looking for more books with studies, facts, and a challenge to live better."
2,Not Bad,"This book is not bad. It has some good information in it for those that are newly diagnosed with APS. If you are looking for more ""doctor"" terms or have some what of an understanding of APS, then I would pass over this book. Great for family and friends who have no knowledge of this dx."
5,Good Divco History,Dr. Ebert and Mr. Rienzo have done an excellent job of researching the quintessential builder of milk trucks and multi-stop delivery vehicles in the 20th Century. No truck historian or chocolate milk lover should be without this book.
2,Ballast broke after 13 months,It is a great light but mine broke down after 13 months. It seems like the built in ballast is broken because it is just flashing randomly. I have not found a replacement part.
2,We'll see,"No where in the ad does it state this is made by Coralife, a great brand except for this model. This model seems to last 18 to 24 months before the starter goes out and can't be replaced. It happened to me and others. A great light when it works but they don't last. Don't just take my word, read the reviews for the model that does state it is made by Corallife."
3,Nice design but don't last long,"A nice compact design, but they tend to burn out when a tube burns out. Not very sturdy for the price. Unfortunately I haven't found anything else that fits well in this location."
2,Not worth the money,"These lights are cheap and slim and look good but they do not last. I bought one for my planted tank about a year ago. Then, about six months later,I bought two more because I really liked them. Then the first one that I had bought died a couple of months later and then the other two stopped working a few months later. I imagine their ballasts are not made to last too long. Besides, the reflector is pretty bad. I did not even think it was worth my time and money to deal with Coralife and pay shipping to return these lights. Since then I upgraded to another brand, which at $30 more, are miles away in terms of quality and probably longevity. Unless you plan to keep them only for a few months don't bother."
4,"So Far, So Good","I was nervous about buying this product due to all of the negative reviews. So far, it has performed well. There are very few T5 NO light fixtures so you have to go with what's available. Right now, I would buy this product again."
1,On third one from company - they just die,My third one just died for no reason not the bulbs just does not turn on anymore. Company has replaced before no questions asked which means they know these stink
5,Amazing!,This light fixture is AMAZING! We have a 36 gallon bowfront aquarium. Prior to this light all our live plants were dying because we couldn't get enough wattage to keep them alive. First we tried different bulbs in hopes of alleviating the problem but that didn't work. We did not want some elaborate light set up nor did we want to spend a ton of money. This fixture did the trick. All our plants are doing great and the fixture was very affordable. I highly recommend this product!UPDATE: One of the bulbs burnt out after I had the unit for 3 weeks. I contacted Aqueon and they replaced the bulb free of charge. Great customer service!
1,"Should have listened to other reviews, it is junk","I ordered the 48 inch light even after reading the reviews thinking some good some bad. I got it hooked it up, turned it on worked great. 3rd day went to turn it on, and nothing. That is unreal, I thought maybe I was crazy so unplugged and tried it again nothing. Will be sending back today. Here is a shock, I requested a replacement and 14 hrs later it still has not even been shipped. Well that says something in its self. When you buy anew one they send you crap and when you want a new one they are in no hurry to send it for free.....Got it today, no packing on this shipment, and it was already opened. Wow I guess they really dont care to much about reoccurring business. Just sell and wait for the next sucker."
3,Ram Jaane-expectations-disappointed.,"Although I am a huge fan of SRK movies. And I hope to see all that he has done-this one was just o.k.-He plays a negative character and I prefer to see him in the good-guy-Hero type roles. The quality of the movie was not very good. Showed some lines - like it came from a tape. Glad I got to see it, but really glad I didnt purchase it. I have been buying the ones I really like."
1,Very ordinary,this should be named as mobile and wireless glossary. it's not beyond that. no in depth analysis of design issues or technologies related to wireless and mobile industry. not good for wireless/mobile techies. will recommend to sales people who want to have very high level idea about this field.
5,"Top notch, no BS book for the techie or his manager","Mallick's no-bs approach to taking the wireless ether, breaking it down into the elements that make it up, and then presenting it in a way that people from the warm diet-[drink] drinking geek to the pointy haird ""Dilbert"" manager is top notch.Rather then being motivated by pitching products or solutions, the book does an outstanding job of painting the entire wireless landscape. What are the moving parts, how do they interact, and what is the impact they provide on the entire architecture. The writing style is down to earth, conversational, and brief.This book is a must-have reference for anyone's home tech library."
5,Outstanding Material,"Pee Wee Crayton's Imperial material is by far his best. He learned how to play guitar from the master himself, T-Bone Walker. He went on to record some wonderful T-Bone infused original blues. Like others have mentioned, it is most unfortunate that this disc is OOP. However, the search for it and cost at a bit of a premium is well worth it."
5,classics of Pee Wee Crayton,"This CD contains Pee Wee Crayton's blues classics of the good old days. The sound is raw. Pee Wee's vocal is young and smooth. Conversations with rythm section is humorous. Good CD. So, I say go for it!"
4,Way lot of fun!,"I just received my Bach Complete Works extravaganza.It is just amazing to sort through the variety of Bach's work just by instrument and voice. I have liked Bach for years, at least in theory. Because I haven't done much more than the Brandenburg Concertos. Many years ago I listened to the harpsichord repertoire but have since neglected it.I have found this set set quite fun. I even enjoyed playing the cantatas on ""background"" while I proceeded through the day, just like some people do with jazz.I agree that you could find a better Brandenburg Concertos, as I have, but it is still good enough to stand a listen. But the idea is that for the price you get good performances and a huge variety. Then you can research on Amazon for your best bet on some favorite you discover in this set."
1,Magnificent Compilation,"A magnificent compilation of Bach's work which is substantially blemished by poor recording and mastering techniques. You'll find what interests you here, and often go elsewhere for decently balanced and acoustically well-rendered recordings. This is tragic, because many of the performances in this collection are very good or even excellent."
4,All the Bach you ever wanted,"I haven't yet had time to listen to all the CDs in this set, but what I've heard so far is excellent. There are better recordings (at least of the works I'm familiar with - the Gould and Jarrett recordings of the Goldberg Variations, the Casals cello stuff and the Tognetti violin partitas for instance) but this is a very useful reference for anyone who's interested in Bach's music. It also has the advantage of being played (as far as I can determine) on Baroque instruments. I recommend it."
4,Downloading to my Ipod problems,"Just begining to listen.As far as now, I have enjoied the music.When downloading to my Ipod I found the frecuent problem about the track names i.e. Some times the composer field is Bach, Johann Sebastian, some times is J.S. Bach, etc and also diferent criteria used for album name , etc...."
1,Missing CD's and inflexible service,"When I received the set of Bach CD's, one was missing. I informed Amazon and requested that they send me the missing CD. I was told that, no, they couldn't do that but would have to send another whole set. When the second set arrived it, too, was missing a CD but, fortunately, not the one that was missing from the first set. Now, I have to pack up the second set, now missing two CD's, and take it to the post office on my next day off to return it to Amazon, all because they would not honor my request to just send me the missing CD. Thumbs down to Amazon and Brilliant for poor quality control and poor service."
5,Awesome,"Simply awesome. Not only is it a ridiculously good bargain at under $1 per CD (prior to this I was considering another complete Bach set for 8x the price), but to my surprise these are some of my favorite recordings ever. Holland has become sort of an epicenter of Bach these days, and this Dutch group does not disappoint.The recording quality is excellent, and what I especially love in the cantatas is the authentic singing: no annoying overblown vibrato or modern rubato thrown in, just pure, sweet, golden tone. And I love the smaller orchestrations, you can really hear each individual line so clearly. I absolutely adore this box set, I think no household should be without it!"
5,Spectacular bargain,"I am roughly two-thirds of the way through the cantatas, and have covered much of the keyboard and instrumental works. Many of the cantatas are delightful, and it is a shame they don't get more attention than they do. Considering the price, I have been very pleased with the quality of the performances.Best money I've ever spent."
4,A surprising box set,"Bach is my favourite composer, so I did not hesitate to buy this Box Set. All I can say is it is an insane bargain! The Cantatas alone are well worth the price.Von Asperen contributions in some keybord pieces are just great.Nevertheless, I consider the harspichord and organ recordings just decent. The performers definitely did not manage to transmit Bach's ""mathematical style"".If you want reference harpsichord recordings, take a look at Trevor Pinocks recordings. For organ, Helmut Walcha is a much better option."
3,"A complete collection, but not really a great collection...","I like the fact that I have a ""complete"" collection of works, but, frankly, I'm having more difficulty finding recordings that I like than enjoying the ""completeness"" of the collection.I'm no classical snob or expert (I'm more into GnR, Metallica, Rage Against the Machine), but I do REALLY enjoy a little Bach and Mozart from time to time. So, take my opinion of the collection for what it is. I have a few Bach CDs that seemed to be more ""professional"" and better recorded, and I find myself turning to those rather than trying to pick the winners from the losers in this massive collection.So, I'd guess I'm summarize my review by saying that if you want a ""complete"" set of Bach's works, then maybe this is for you. But if you want a set of ""great"" works by Bach, I wouldn't buy this set..."
4,awesome!,"Okay, so some of the recordings are not great. That's true, and I'm not a discerning listener. However, look at the title again--""Complete Works"". If you like classical music and you haven't built up a library of misc. Bach CDs, how could you not buy this? I'm playing it through, and I'm enjoying it immensely."
4,Fantastic bargain,"I entirely agree with many of the posters who call this a mixed bag. Some of the performances are first-rate, some are only OK, a few are unlistenable, especially some choruses which are harsh sounding. Nevertheless, the collection represents a cornucopia of some of the greatest music ever created, and even some of the more modest performances are surprisingly moving. If you are not already familiar with the entire Bach Werke, this set offers a real adventure of discovery. But even a devoted Bach scholar will find much to like."
2,"VeggieTales is great, But Little Dogs is getting better!","I like VeggieTales and always will! They are great with all the 3D-Anamation. But there videos are getting a little down there first 7 were the best, after that, they went down hill. Larry-Boy's are really never that good, they are too much Larry-Boy, but still the same you have to buy this video to hear Larry-Boy tell that he is the hero. But if you really want the humor of all the old VeggieTales, and you really like VeggieTales, then you will LOVE this new series that they are coming out with. It is called: Little Dogs On The Prarie, and it is great! Look for it at your christian book store. Tommy nelson dose it! Find more about it at: www.littledogs.cjb.net You will love these cute 30 minute Doggies that have many catchy songs and are really funny!"
2,Very scary for sensitive minds,"My 6 year old has a very sensitive imagination, and this DVD scared the life out of him - so much that he asked me to stop it. He then couldn't get to sleep because he couldn't get the big weed out of his mind. Also my other kids (4 and 2) while not so scared by it, were also standing by the door while watching because they were scared enough not to sit in their seats.Anyway this might be fine if you children don't mind stuff a little scary, but I wouldn't recommend it for any children who struggle with this."
1,Reviw,"I ordered this video since the beginning of February and now it is March and have not received it yet..... This is not a good sale...I have order from previous sellers, and they sent my product within two weeks..I am so unhappy with this seller......"
5,Amazingly Funny!,"I had no idea a kids video could be this funny, and still communicate a message.Rumors, as we grown-ups pretend to know are bad, bad, bad. And we know a rumor can have implications which devastate the victim.In this computer-animated tale, a rumor is spread, and a weed is the metaphor. Unless the weed is removed, it grows and invests the Veggie Tales world.Feel confident that the Big Idea group has done it again, bringing wholesome, balanced, hilarious entertainment into your family's life.I fully recommend this video."
5,Larry-Boy is one fantastic **** SUPERHERO ****,"This is one of the best of all the Veggie Tales !!!! There is a valuable lesson concerning gossip and how it can hurt good people. Our grandchildren totally enjoy Rumor Weed & my husband & I enjoy watching it with, or without, our grandchildren. THIS ONE IS GREAT! !!!!!!"
2,When it's Too Good to be True,"This system seemed the answer for our needs - potability, long range, caller ID, and answering capability. It worked like a dream for about one week until we started to notice clips in transmission while speaking and even disconnection if the second line was activated. The idea is excellent and the handsets are easy to use and program. If only Siemens could upgrade the most important part of this system - the transmission. We're in the market for another system now. P.S. Siemens customer service was excellent, they overnighted a new base system to us for exchange. Unfortunately, the problems persisted."
2,Caller ID is incompatible with other Phones,If you have any other non-siemens phone with caller ID plugged into your home then the Siemens phone will only randomly show you the Caller ID. According to Siemens support this is an issue with their Caller ID software. I found it unacceptable that such and expensive phone could not support the Caller ID function if I had other phones with Caller ID. Other than this problem the phone worked fine. I had even bought 3 additional extensions until I discovered the Caller ID problem.
1,Don't buy this phone,"I agree with all the other negative reviews. I invested $400 to outfit my house with several of these phones 2 years ago. Only one is still working properly. Static, fuzzy calls. And the phones are not very durable. One drop and you're hosed."
1,Stopped Working 9 Months After Buying,"I just got off hold for the second time with the customer service group at Siemens. The first time I was on hold for 45 minutes before I hung up out of disgust. It took them 15 minutes to pick up the second time.I am being sent a new handset free of postage. But I now have to reprogram all my friend's names and numbers into the new phone! UGH!Although I am getting a new handset, I am really disappointed in the quality of this phone. It worked great, and I had zero complaints about reception quality or phone quality up until two nights ago. The phone was stuck ""on"" and none of the buttons would work. I took the batteries out and now it won't turn back on. This shouldn't have happened after 9 months of careful use (i.e., I haven't abused it).I highly suggest that you think twice before purchasing this phone, especially seeing that customer service is hard to get on the line."
4,Great phone.,It is an excellent phone with great reception and durability. The cons are that its not very attractive and the button placements and menus aren't very efficient.
1,they make medical equipment not phones,"i ordered this phone through the marketplace, when it arrived i charged it up full, it would not let you do anything...kept flashing register when i would it came back over and over register. i finally through it down the trash chute where garbage belongs. siemens should stick to medical equipment and leave cordless phones alone. i read 51 reviews just about all bad on this phone.....i should have listened ... . DO NOT BUY ANY SIEMENS CORDLESS PHONES."
1,Flawed - I have 5 that I can't use!,"I spoke with Siemens teck. They know that the thing ""Picket Fences."" There is a design flaw that makes it short out. Once it is dropped, the insulating plate moves out of place.Becomes unusable! Warble, static, ""No Channel Avalable""-a"
1,Wretched blasted thing,"In common with other users (discovered too late by me!) I've had plenty of trouble with this Siemens phone. In nearly every conversation, after a few minutes, the person I'm talking to will report that they can't hear me, that it sounds like I'm underwater. Ugh."
2,Looks aren't everthing!!,"When I first saw this phone and read about it's features, I thought I had finally found an answer to many phones with differing operations and features. I bought the 2410 and 2 extra handsets and setup was very easy. The tone quality was fine but range and battery life were abysmal. Then the problems with intermitent caller ID function began. I suffered for a few months with that until I called Siemens customer service who replaced the base unit without a whimper. No improvement. Why can a $10 caller ID box that I bought from Radio Shack work every time and a caller ID function on a ... phone system from Siemens work only sporadically?? I love the phones for their design and the functions that could have been but I called Siemens one last time and now they are gladly replacing the whole system with an entirely different model. I have high hopes once again. My advice... stay away from the 2410."
2,Lots of problems,"Siemens is a company with a great reputation for hi end equipment, but this phone system is a bad product. On the positive side, the features and functionality of the whole base station idea are fantastic. On the negative side: 2.4 GHz is notorious for microwave interference (I can attest to this), the range was no more than my old 900MHz, callers would daily complain of my voice ""digitizing"" or ""strobing"" to the point where I had to get on a hard line phone, the handset is too thin to attempt to cradle between your head and neck. Customer service is commendable, but I sent back every phone including the base set once and am still having problems. Don't buy this phone system."
1,Stay away,"Like so many others, we've experienced the ""underwater"" problem. I called Siemens, only to learn that the toll-free number has been changed to a toll number. When I contacted them, I was told that the problem is a persistent one in the handset. I could return it (it's still under warranty), but there is no guarantee that they would agree to replace it, since it's an ""old"" model (as if that should make a different for a product purchased a few months ago). So the product itself is defective, and the service is terrible. Evidently, they wish to go out of business soon, and I hope they do."
2,poor range and voice quality,"I was excited when this phone became available. I just bought an old house and hoped I wouldn't have to hardwire new jacks all over the house. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! The range is worse than my cheap 900Mhz phone, it doesn't even reach all the rooms in my house, let alone the backyard. The voice quality is poor as well. It sounds OK from my end, most of the time, but the people on the other end frequently complain that it sounds like I am under water."
1,don't do it,"I bought this phone and an additional handset with high hopes. yikes. the additional handset never got good reception, even when I held it next to the transmitter. the other unit was periodically great. the caller id, multiple level redial, number storage features are all great-if the display works...spare yourself. yearn for the days when we all leased our phones from at&t."
2,"Nice features, but it keeps breaking.","When I first got this phone, I was in love with it. It was the perfect thing for our apartment. I needed a phone in the second bedroom, but I didn't want to run a new jack in the room because there was too much furniture that would have needed to be moved. The supplemental handset which doesn't need a phone jack worked out perfectly.The first week we had the system, the main handset broke when the power button got stuck. I figured this was a fluke and that someone was probably just too rough with it. Amazon quickly replaced the dead unit with no problems.Now after a little over a year, the replacement handset has broken as well. It won't even turn on. If this was a cheaper unit I'd say ok - you get what you pay for, but considering the price of the system, I think you should get much more than a year's worth of use out of it."
1,Don't buy this phone,"I had such high hopes for this phone. It looks nice, the satellite phone units are cool. Unfortunately, they just don't work. Siemens has had to replace it 4 times now, and it still keeps breaking--our voices keep breaking up and then people can't hear us at all (a problem with a phone, wouldn't you say?). This phone is a disaster."
1,A lot of money for a lousy phone,"This phone has been very disappointing. The range is less thanthe Sony 900Mhz that this phone was supposed to replace. Battery life is very low. The worst problem is the intermittent audio dropouts. It'll work for a while, then the person on the other end only hears every other word. I've hear rumors that there is a poor design of the contacts in this phone, but find no solid proof. The replacement phone that Siemens sent had the same problem. On the bright side, Siemens agreed to send a 2420 to replace this piece of junk. Good customer service, but a lousy phone."
1,Battery life and reception are terrible,"I got this a few months ago from another vendor, and it's a horrid phone. I live in an older (100-year-old) apartment, and you could hear static on the phone from the kitchen on the other end of the apartment. Not precisely what I was expecting from a 2.4GHz phone! People could tell when I was wandering about the apartment.And then the batteries started dying. I used to have a VTech analog digital, and after about 3 years the batteries started only giving me like 4-5 hours of use. At this point, I'm lucky if I have time to check my voice mail before my batteries completely die! I'm sorry, but that's just horrible performance."
1,What a Piece...,I would give it ZERO stars if possible. Horrible interference. A constant annoying hum is heard. However it is comfortable to hold against your head if thats a plus.
2,Caller ID inconsistant,"Very happy with the phone at first. I then discovered that the Caller ID funtion was displaying ""unavailable"" for calls that were previously displayed. Exchanged the base and had same problem. Seimens was not very helpful. They said there is a technical problem with signal from some phone company's in displaying caller ID. Engineer was suppose to call but never did. Phone was returned, I was disappointed."
1,Useless Hitech phone,"When I bought this phone I was very happy with it for the first week. Nice design, excellent sound, good functions. However, after a while I got audio dropouts which were obviously related to a loose contact. I exchanged it and had the same problems with the second one. I wouldn't buy it again!"
1,LCD screen breaks on the first day.,"This phone was to replace the Panasonic 2.4ghz phone. I charged the batteries, played with the settings and put the phone to use. When I get off the phone I usuall toss it on the sofa or on the bed. Well it bounced off the bed, hit the carpeted floor and cracked the LCD screen...it really should be shock resistant."
1,Don't trust these reviews,"There's something goofy about the reviews for this phone. I purchased the phone based, in part, on the great reviews I read here. I was VERY disappointed with the phone. It did not live up to the 5 star reviews that I read. Now, I realize that there are a few 5 star and some 1 star. I think there's someone who works for Siemens writing a bunch of favorable reviews. Check out todays top reviewer. It says 103 of 103 found the review helpful, but only one or two people read the other reviews. Seems suspicious to me, particularly since the phone is a piece of junk."
1,Terrible,"This album is simply lousy and boring. It's one of the worst Blues albums I've ever heard, and I've heard hundreds. The guitar playing is unoriginal, the vocals are below average, and the same lyrics are constantly repeated. Surely Charity could have come up with a few more verses for each song. There are some Blind Boy Fuller songs covered by Charity, but they look truly poor compared to the originals. If you're interested in discs available from Trix Records, I suggest you buy the Henry Johnson disc, as he was the best artist recorded by the label. Avoid ""The Virginian"" album."
4,What kind of fan are YOU?,"It's really hard to describe this DVD simply because it mostly depends on how much of a WWE fan you are. If you are a hardcore fan like me then this DVD is right up your alley with new songs not previously released. If you are not really a big fan then I wouldn't buy this simply because it probably won't hold your interest. The content of this DVD includes:1-Triple H entrance2-The Hurricane entrance3-The Undertaker (new one) entrance4-The Rock entrance5-Billy+Chuck entrance6-Mr. McMahon entrance (same song, new video)7-Kane (old entrance, not the Forceable Entry song or video)8-Chris Jericho entrance9-Edge entrance (it's not the Rob Zombie song but his new video)10-Kurt Angle entrance"
2,Is the WWE serious?!,"When I first heard about the title of this DVD, it sounded kind of cool as I thought that they would have old and new titantron videos like the old D-Generation X, Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, and The Rock videos. Unfortunately, I was let down in a huge way. First of all, there are only 10 entrance videos! Just 10! No DVD extras, nothing! For anyone who's interested, here is the entrance video list:The RockVince McMahonKaneChris JerichoEdgeKurt AngleThe HurricaneBilly and ChuckTriple HThe UndertakerWhile this is not a bad line up, the WWE should realize that instead of paying [money]for the DVD. People could just as easily go to their website and download these videos. I strongly discourage anyone to buy this."
2,Save your money,"I thought this video was ok. I was surprised that Edge's ""You think you know me"" replaced ""Rob Zombie's ""Never Gonna Stop"". I was glad that Taker got rid of that annoying ""Rollin', Rollin', Rollin'"" music. I hated the fact that Billy and Chuck's was on there. The Rock's ""If Ya Smelll"" was also featured, as well as Hurricane's titantron. Thriple H's ""Time to Play the Game"" also on there. I was dissapointed that Kane's new theme ""Slow Chemical"" was not featured. The others were Vince McMahon, Kurt Angle For the most part not a very impressive line-up. Don't buy."
1,"Rip-off, avoid.","This is pretty pathetic, Only 10 Titatron video's? If a DVD can fit 175 minute films like Lord of the Rings onto one Disc then I think it can safely manage more than 10 video's.I mean, who actually wants to sit down and watch these? You might aswell get a videogame like Smackdown 4 on PS2 or RAW on X-box and watch all the titantron video's on that (I know for a fact that X-box RAW has at least 40 entrance video's). Presuming each titantron video lasts an average of 90 seconds (they loop), then this means they could actually fit 120+ different Superstats titatantron video's on one Disc with sound. I don't even think WWE has that many wrestlers.Only buy this Disc if you like throwing money away."
2,"Cool concept, but it could have been better.","Don't buy this! They had a good ideal, but they just didn't seem to be able to bring this to life. Not to mention Kurt Angle's video IS NOT WHAT THEY SHOW ON IT! Please don't waste your money!"
1,Others speak the truth!,"for those who bashed about how much they hated it ,so did i! common WWE 10 titantron videos for money!?!? if there was like 50 i guess you could buy it , but this is just another cheap attempt for some dough, save your money folks anyways heres the stars videos in it.Y2jVince McMahonKaneKurt AngleRockHHHHurricaneEdgeThe UndertakerChuck & Billyoverall , u could watch this on the internet for free or if u have a xbox or ps2 u can also!RIP OFF!"
2,Blatant [poor value],"With a total of only 10 videos on this DVD, it's hard to recommend it to any but the most ardent WWE completist. While each 3 minute video has high production values and is good fun, it's hard to believe that the WWE couldn't find it in themselves to deliver some value for money by cramming more than 10 videos onto the disc. Instead of trying to sell a 30 minute DVD, what about including some older or now superseded videos to pad it out?Avoid it unless you feel an obsessive desire to own at least one of every WWE item ever produced."
3,about the DVD,"there are only 10 videos on this DVD. the videos are extended versions, so you do see parts of the video that you won't see on TV. the entire DVD is only 30 mins, so that's approx. 3 mins for each video. i think it would be a lot better if there were more videos on it....then again, i'm probably biased, cuz my favorite wrestlers entrance videos are not on it."
4,Ummm....depends on how you look at it,"Well while I would have to be hell of bored (i.e. strapped down and forced to watch) to watch this DVD it will probably be a good thing in the fact that you could put in your DVD player and turn up the volume to listen to some theme songs that have not yet been released on CD yet. [For a couple of dollars], why not? If it sucks you can just say that you are a collector."
1,No Way Out,"WWE has decided that it's smart to instead of releasing No Way Out 00, or 01 on DVD, to release DVD's like Divas Undressed, or even WWE ""Ramped Up"". This is the stupidest DVD I've ever even heard of by far, they should be giving this away free as a bonus DVD to buy some of their others', .... Why would I pay money to see 10 videos that I see on Raw or Smackdown anyway? Just buying almost any other DVD gives you your share of these 10 videos, that nobody cares about in the first place. Why not add a highlight match for each superstar ""Ramped Up"" features as an extra? Why not fill the DVD with videos', as a DVD is obviously capable of? Because WWE wants to make more volumes. Yes, folks the sad truth is WWE wants your money. Don't give it to them."
1,WWE Hasn't released Vengeance 02.,"WWE has decided that instead of releasing the sort-of-okay PPV that preluded Summerslam, Vengeance 02, they will instead release an assortment of DVD's that are even less worthy of your time or money. These being Diva's Undressed, probably the worst WWE program I've ever seen in my life, and Diva's Las Vegas, which I wouldn't waste my time on. But worst of all, as if to stand on a higher grounds and look down upon these two disasters is WWE Ramped Up. Is there any reason to buy this? I can't think of one, I mean it might be cool to find on the street, but why would you want to pay money for this? Do yourself a favor and pre-order Summerslam 02, or buy any other DVD. Even KotR 02 is more worth your money than this. Hell, buy any DVD and I bet you you'll get some of those video's as an ""extra"". Way to go, Vince. Thanks for not releasing No Way Out 00, 01, but giving us WWE Ramped Up, you senile ..."
4,Academic Reality,"Contains a good combination of hard science and the politics of actually getting stuff done. I appreciated the details of experimental particle physics, but the best part of the book is the insider perspective on getting grant money, timing the delivery of experimental results and positioning oneself for recognition from the Nobel committee. The interplay between the theorists and experimentalists was also illuminating. The only negative factor's were the needless comments on what people were wearing at a meeting or how handsome/pretty they were that day and I believe (not positive since the only account I have is the book) a few remarks that were quite obviously taken out of context and the author failed to acknowledge this."
3,fine for genre fiction,"I was surprised when I first landed here to see that ""The Black Cloud"" is apparently so much more popular than Fred Hoyle's more compelling science fiction works, ""Andromeda Breakthrough"", ""A is for Andromeda"", ""October the First is Too Late"", etc. A bit of mouse-clicking showed me the answer: the rest of Fred Hoyle's science fiction is out of print. This is sad. Maybe buying ""The Black Cloud"" will encourage someone to bring back the others.Recommended: ""October the First is Too Late"", Paul Creston's ""Principles of Rhythm"", Jeff Burns's ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"" (still in print!)."
5,Brilliant (as usual),"There's not much to add to the reviews below. Sir Fred Hoyle, scientist and polymath extraordinaire, was also one of our greatest sci-fi novelists, and it is a pity that his SF works are not better known. Anyway, its all here with a brilliant prescience: scientific discovery, political obtrusiveness, nuclear winter, the steady-state universe theory, the unintelligibility of extraterrestial intelligent life, right down to the tragic ending. Any lover of thoughtful SF should read this excellent book."
2,"Nave, but funny","I definitely enjoyed reading this book, though it is a bit naive and poor written. Anyway, it is always nice to have a science fiction book done by a honorable scientist"
5,Their best record of the '90s!,"This is their one and only release in the '90s which offers the same great innovative potential as the recordings in the beginning of their career. Liz Fraser's voice is set against a metallic-cold but fascinating background of industrial-techno rhythms and alienated guitar-samples. Unfortunately they've missed this chance to update their sound, and the following album ""Milk and Kisses"" was a depressingly safe mainstream-pop affair. This noble double-foldout Digipak may be a bit expensive, but it's worth the money all over. If you like this sound, check out the fabulous techno-rock-group Seefeel of remixer Mark Clifford and their side-projects Disjecta, Scala and Locust."
1,The sequel to the Chinese water toture?,"This stuff is like an endurance test. How many times can *you* listen to the same theme repeated over and over and over, without screaming, ""Change the chords, for crying out loud! Vary the tempo. Add a new melody. Anything!""This is not music, as such. There are snippets of songs here which build up a tension through repetition that is never released. Then the track ends. Musicalis interruptus. Except that they could not completely ruin Violane. They tried, though.I cannot believe this material is from the same period as Cocteau Twins' Milk and Kisses album. The weakest song on that record is ten times better than anything here. Beware that this material is not representative of the other songs Cocteau Twins were releasing at the time."
2,Save your money!,I have this cd and I hardly ever listen to it... I'm even a big CT fan... If you must collect every cd by them make this your very last... lol
5,stunning in its beauty,"One of the most beautiful albums of all time. Ballad after ballad, and some of the most melodic music ever. The harmonies are fantastic, the singing is phenomenal. Listen to Russel Hitchcock as he reaches the high, powerful notes in the gorgeous 'she never heard me call'. Listen to the gorgeous melody and guitars in the closer 'what kind of girl'. Delight in what must be one of the best songs of ALL time, 'Don't be afraid' leaves me in awe each time I hear it. This is true music. Nothing can sound this good. 'Come what may' is a soaring love song that is really emotional for those really in love, another great vocal. The other tracks are no less wonderful, there isn't a clunker amongst the lot. Some may claim it is boring and uninspired cheese, but I say air supply new what they were doing and did it amazingly. No experimentation here, just sublime melodies."
2,Especially forced,"After Alice's triumphant punk debut and return to rock ""Flush the Fashion"", he pulled out this release. Not very special or very good. Is it better than ""Zipper""? Definitely. Does it come close to his best material? You've got to be kidding! Overall, this release is a disappointment, but does contain some excellent rock cuts like ""Who Do You Think We Are"" and ""Vicious Rumors"". Only buy if you believe that Alice can do no wrong."
4,Alice Cooper,One of the clasic I ever wanted to have in CD. A lot of years ago I had this album in LP and when I saw it in Amazon at that excelent price I could not restist to buy it. If Alice Cooper is one of your artist this is a must have album.
3,"This is not Alice at his best, But is still worth buying",It's on OK album for someone who is not Alice Cooper. It has some good tunes and some not so good tunes. But if you want a change of music style then it's alright to listen to once in a while. Flush the Fashion was a similiar album. This album has Alice in some of the scariest makeup ever.
3,Alice's Miltary Goof,"Still following the new wavish line of ""Flush The Fashion,"" ""Special Forces"" retreads the same territory but with less interesting results. ""Who Do We Think We Are"" and ""You're a Movie"" catch him at his best, but an unnecessary remake of ""Generation Landslide"" and a ill advised cover of ""Seven and 7 Is"" pull ""Special Forces"" up short. The goofy ""Prettiest Cop On The Block"" sits pretty well with the psuedo military gone haywire theme, but this is mostly Alice trying too hard."
4,another good new waver,This wasn't as well put together as 'flush the fashion' was. That one was perfect new wave rocker. But this one has some really cool songs on it like 'who do we think we are' that rocks just right. Some alice fans hate this period of his career and the boneheads even hate his later metal stuff! but you can't fault a metal fan for being dissapointed with this one. I like this one though but it's not a classic like 'flush the fashion' was imo.
3,Alice Cooper Stages,"My favorite releases of Alice Cooper are Flush The Fashion, Zipper Catches Skin, Dragontown, and Brutal Planet, but this one has some good songs and is great for my collection."
4,Good to Have,"This is the best headrest I found, it had two layers, so it somewhat grows with your baby, and you can put it anywhere you baby sits, i had one for each the carseat, swing, and bouncer. And I liked the two layers because it gave my daughter extra support with both pieces there and when she got bigger i just took one out. The only thing i had trouble with was readjusting it every time i had to sit her somewhere, and she outgrew it fast, but i guess thats the same with any headrest, you only need them for the first two months."
1,Not needed,I bought this item thinking that it would be necessary with a newborn. It was not needed at all because my carseat (Graco) came with one that attached to the carrier itself. A waste of money if you ask me. Buy a carseat with the right gear and this is totally unnecessary.
5,THIS is the Blues . . .,"Blues is definately something I love. It's something I ache for, and this album soothes my nerves. It's one of the best compilations of old time blues that I've ever heard of. For anyone who enjoys the sweet chordhs of Leadbelly and Muddy Waters, or the melodious pipes of Bessie Smith, this is an ideal selection. These songs hold strong to the Blues tradition of emotion, hardship, love, nostalgia, stress, fear, death and taxes. I highly recommend the purchase of this fine album."
2,Not so good,"I purchased this book online and was attracted by the bright pictures. The illustrations are not as vibrant as shown here, and the story is rather boring, not much happens!"
2,"Spend your book $$$ on ""Stand Tall Molly Lou Melon"" instead!!!!","Yet another preachy book with the important themes of acceptance ... HOWEVER, ""Odd Velvet"" cannot compare to the rich, crisp text and outstanding illustrations of the Patty Lovell/David Catrow gem ""Stand Tall Molly Lou Melon"". Give ""Molly Lou"" a try!!!"
4,Classics by Trini,Trini Lopez high energy and emotional style shows why these classics have endured forever.These songs will be part of Musical lore for another 60 years.
4,knowing bronze,Jenny has spent considerable time detailing some fine sackler bronzes.The insight between Shang Dynasty and Zhou is a fine line in Zhou progression of a master craft.If you want a look at some of the best bronze without flying to washington DC-it is a must.
3,Pay attention to the fine print......,"As an avid Jethro Tull/Ian Anderson fan, I found this title while searching for any more solo work by the Famous Flautist. ""Continuous Preachin' Blues"" by Mike Cooper and Ian Anderson....hmmm, this could be GOOD! (Hats off to amazon for actually getting it to me) Well, guess what, this ain't Ian Anderson the flute player!! It's Ian A. Anderson and Mike Cooper, serving up some tasty dobro and slide guitar blues. It would be hard to guess the nationality of the players just by listening to the instruments, but this is blues with an English accent. I get the feeling that I'm sitting in a small dark pub with these guys up on stage laying down the blues, simple, nothing fancy. Kinda like seeing The Jeff Healy Band in the movie ""Roadhouse"". Anyhow, you've got to check out their covers of ""You Never Can Tell"" by Chuck Barry and ""Paint It Black"" by Jagger. It ain't the flute player, but I ain't disappointed, either!!"
1,This is Not an IAN ANDERSON album...!,"This Ian Anderson is not our IAN ANDERSON ! So this is not a IAN ANDERSON ( of JETHRO TULL ) solo album. TULLIAN's dont be a fault like me . PS:( This is a kind of Blues album , not bad ).Be TULL.BORA CETIN 45 years old ""Crazy Fan"" from Istanbul,TURKEY."
1,BEWARE! Not THE Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull.,"Unfortunately, one must read CAREFULLY every word of 3rd party sellers. This CD is shown on a page along with a photo of the REAL Ian Anderson, thus you are being enticed to purchase something that is not the real thing. If you buy it thinking it's an Ian Anderson recording, either be content to keep it, or if the seller agrees to refund your purchase when you discover the mistake, you will still pay shipping BOTH WAYS. Let this seller keep this very poor attempt at ""music"", or venture where most music lovers prefer to avoid. I wonder what the REAL Ian Anderson would think of this fool trying to capitalize on his name with the gawd-awful sounds on this CD......"
5,One Soldier,Very refreshing account of the grimness and hopelessness of combat. Bitterly honest. Shows the boredom of combat broken only by the periods of stark fear. Also very much encompasses the petty nitpicking known only to enlisted men. Captivating read for military historians looking for the experience of the common soldier rather than the heroic often fabricated accounts as officers write in their memoirs.
3,Not In My House!,"To quote a line from the book: ""Uh-oh!"" is right. I frequently choose Early Readers such as What A Mess! (a STEP Into Reading book intended for Preschool to Grade 1) even though my girls (ages 3 and 2) are not yet learning to read. The patterned text + playful kids + pets seemed ideal for my own little mess makers.BUT...I thought two of the illustrations were irresponsible. ""Dennis"" is drawing pictures on the wall with his crayons. ""Lee"" is using Mama's lipstick to paint a clown face. I've got enough problems without giving my girls the impression that such behavior is acceptable.That said, I am sure your emergent reader is old enough to know better and will enjoy solving the mystery of the muddy footprints - right down to the surprise ending!"
3,Good but somewhat disappointing compared to their last one,"Everclear is a great band and I absolutely loved ""Sparkle and Fade"" but I was a bit let down by this album. It's still bettter than almost anything else out there these days but it didn't really stick to my ribs like ""Sparkle"" did. I do know plenty of people who disagree with me on this, though, so don't take my word for it."
5,This CD Rocks!,"So Much for the Aferglow, by the Seattle rock band Everclear, is the follow-up release to their Platminum second-coming album, Sparke and Fade. Art Aleksis' mellow voice and ironic lyrics make this band an astounding success. Hits- Everything to Everyone; I Will Buy You a New Life Good Songs- White Men in Black Suits, all of them Bad Songs- none, basicly Extras- Secreat Song after last song."
5,This CD kicks a**,"This CD proves that Everclear will never make a bad CD or song at that. My favorite songs are ""So Much for the Afterglow"" and ""Father of Mine""."
2,i didnt like it,"ive read some of the 1-star reviews out there. theyre all right, everclear is nothing but three-chord songs with no creativity. but i dont hate it, i just didnt like it. i bought it, listened to it, then sold it. this is just typical mainstream nothingness. very little creativity."
3,Average - all songs sound the same,"I'll officially end the Art Alexikis bandwagon right here. His so-called ""brilliant"" and ""touching"" songs were far from enough to keep this CD afloat. ""Father of Mine"" is a gem, and ""New Life"" is underappreciated, but the rest seemed to be hastily thrown together and based far too much on Alexikis' lyrics. Except for the derranged lyrics to ""white men..."" about a topless dancer living a in hell hole, it's actually quite uplifting.Overall, this is just another cheap ripoff of Green Day."
4,Great CD,"Everclear is one of my favorite bands... I just really like Art Alexakis's distinctive voice... I love the songs, ""So Much For The Afterglow"", ""Everything to Everyone"", and ""Father of Mine"" I find this a great CD and every fan of alternative should own it!"
5,nearly flawless (better than their last one),"i just got this cd a week ago and i listened to it in the car on my way back home. i already knew some of the songs:so much for the afterglow, i will buy you a new life, normal like you, father of mine, amphetimine, and sunflowers. i like all of the songs on the cd (except for maybe one or two). if you want some great alternative music, get this cd."
5,Everclear rules!!,"So Much for the Afterglow is so great that even the name means something great. My favorite song is ""I will buy you a new life"" This CD rocks because it's lyrics are real and from Art's life. They aren't made up. Knowing that, a person can imagine the things he went through, and not put some stranger there."
4,Thank you God...this is real music...,"In an age where pop and rap are kings, and great bands have sold out (not pointing any fingers... *cough*Offspring...), this is the one great band left. (outside of MAYBE Cake) The one thing though, is that while this is still one of the best albums ever, it doesn't have addictive hits as great as ""Santa Monica"", ""You Make Me Feel Like A Whore"", and ""Heartspark Dollarsign"" from Sparkle And Fade... Still great though..."
4,A Great cd,"This cd is great cd. I gave it 4 stars because of track 12. (Why I don't believe in God) They have lame excuses and God does exist. God is always there for us. We just have to trust in Him. Otherwise, this cd has great songs. I highly recommend it."
4,Great but too polished.,"I love this CD, but I prefer their first 2 cds better (Sparkle and Fade, World of Noise) they arn't as polished as this one is, but SMFTA is a great cd. PS, Arts last name (Alexakis) is prounounced (Ella-Zah-Kis)"
4,Everclear rocks the boat,How on earth do you correctly say Art's last name? The CD is great. THe videos are even better. I'm coming out of the closet
1,everclear -- what's wrong with music today,"neo-whinyboy rock. no one cares about the ""scared white boy in a black neighborhood."" they play the same three chords over and over. They're not quite as bad as Third Eye Blind, but they're still a sign of the worst of today's popular (read: Alternative -- WHAT ALTERNATIVE?!) music."
5,"powerful, energetic",i love every song on this album...they are all real and sung with so much power and emotion...i love driving and singing along to this music.
5,A Must Have!!,"This is great CD for all you music fans who like rock but a little alternative also. I think ""So much for the afterglow"" ""Father of Mine"" and ""Amphetamine"" are the best songs!"
2,"It's alright, but sadly boring","Now, I mean no disrespect to Everclear but why when I play the chords in, ""Everything to Everyone"", can I sing the words to ""Father of Mine"" and ""I Will Buy You a New Life""?? Everclear needs to think a little harder about their music before they write it."
4,good effort by everclear,the song sunflowers is the best song on this cd. father of mine is good to. in that song i can really hear what art is saying about his father. sparkle and fade is better than so much for the afterglow.
5,If I could give it six stars I would,"If youve heard Everclear's new stuff you might think they kinda suck {Songs From an American movie I & II}. But I can honestly say So Much for the Afterglow is a truly awesome CD {and my personal favorite}. It has ""Father of Mine"" ""Everything to Everyone"" and ""I Will Buy You a New Life"", but those arent even the best songs on the album. It's the only CD I have that I dont skip any songs on. If you are thinking of buying a CD by Everclear, buy this one!"
5,Everclear at its best,"I came to know everclear from their hit ""Father of Mine"" in this album. Turned out to be one of the best cd's I have owned. If you like greenday, blink 182, jimmy eat world, weezer, sum 41, lit, fenix tx, sugarray, incubus, marcy playground, offspring, cake, etc etc... you'll treasure this. Songs from an american movie part 2, and sparkle and fade are also good everclear cd's if you enjoy this one. If you want to sample off of amazon's track list i recommend you check, ""father or mine"" , ""i will buy you a new life"" , ""so much for the afterglow"" , and ""everything to everyone"" are excellent classics. For you more punkish typed like me you have to listen to "" amphetimine"""
5,An Outstanding CD,"This is one of the rock/alternative CDs in my collection, that I play time and time again. The hits ""I Will Buy You A New Life"", ""Father Of Mine"" and ""Everything to Everyone"", are very well crafted and well written songs. The lyrics on each really grab your attention. ""Father of Mine"" is definately a song that speaks of these modern times when so many sons are raised without a father. And with the song ""Why I Don't Believe in God"", Everclear shows they are definately not afraid to speak their mind, and they will let you know where they stand. The music is alternative rock, but original - Everclear certainly doesn't sound like any other band on the radio. This is one of those rock CDs that will become a classic."
4,Its good....but not as good as Sparkle And Fade.,"You will see in the reviews next to this one a whole bunch of people w/5 stars. Well, I would have said that too...but then I bought Sparkle And Fade (Everclear's previous CD). Sparkle and Fade is so much more...more emotion...catchier songs. Please dont get me wrong though. If I were you, Id buy both...but Id get Sparkle And Fade first."
3,It's not that great,"This CD has 2 good songs and the rest is trash. I will buy you a new life and Father of Mine. If you like these two songs, I recommend singles."
4,Good CD,Thought the Cd is real well rounded. Not a dissapointing CD to buy. Not like the one hit wonders you buy with only one good hit.
4,Pretty Good,"I got this CD because I heard ""I Will Buy You a New Life"" on the radio and was obsessed with it. Some of the songs on this CD are really good like ""Father of Mine"" but some I really, really dislike. I should of just gotten singles of the ones I like, but then I wouldn't of heard the others. Some of it is really depressing."
4,Everclear has to be rated as a great band.,"While they cuss a lot, and parents always fuss about their kids language, this is one Cd you don't want to miss, as this alternative band knocks your socks off with every song on this cd!"
1,Creativity anyone?,"I wonder if Everclear knows that musc is a form of creative expression. I honestly cannot distinguish any of their songs from one another. Try this, the ""Everclear Medley,"" sung to the tune of anyone of their songs... ""Father of mine, I will buy you a new house, wade out past the breakers, watch the world die."" Once Everclear finds some new chords maybe it might be worth buying their CD."
1,THE BEST EVERCLEAR CD EVER!!!!!!!!,"I thought that this cd was the bomb. the only reason i picked one start is to get your attention, but i think this is a 10 STAR cd. who ever likes alternative should go out and but it!!! the songs are electicfying!! especially Everthing to everyone."
1,Dont even try it.,"I'll just say this. Don't waste you money. This cd is pop induced dribble, worst ever!"
1,it stunk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!,one phrase... it is the worst cd i ever bough
5,An Adventure in Modern Rock,"One of the greatest bands to come out of America so far and definitely one of the more original.There happy-go-lucky, surfer type songs are extremely well written with infectious melodies and songs about everyday things,be they the childhood scars caused by the now normal dysfunctional family,or the happier times,these songs definitely hit home.Great bass lines and awesome but simple lyrics are what keep Everclear,everclear.Every song is great including the hidden track, which is well woth waiting for. This band is sort of a mixture of Reef and Sublime with a touch of class.kadu81@hotmail.com"
5,Love this CD!,"Everclear is one of my favorite male bands, So Much for the Afterglow is my favorite cd of theirs."
5,You have to really listen.,"This CD is the best. All the songs have some kind of meaning. 6,10,and 12 are great. i highly recoment this CD. It has grean lyrics, great tunes, and everythings differnet. They are much better than anyother out there. Kudos to you Art. Thanks for the great music.!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,the best,this is one of the best cds i've ever bought. i listen to it so much and can't keep myself from singing the songs. the lyrics are great and the guitars make them better. if you don't own this cd already i suggest u buy it.
5,The Greatest Album Ever!,"This album is AMAZING! There's not a song below the level of GREAT! Every song kicks on this CD. For anybody that likes any kind of music, you should go out and buy this album. Heck, even my mom, (the country music lover, that's kinda lame) likes this music. If you aren't deaf, buy the CD, you'll love it, guarenteed!"
4,Great CD,"I love this CD. After the first weekend that I had it (75 listens or so) I realized that while the songs have the same beat, they are still really fun. The only bad thing is that it cusses a bit, but I overlook that now and just play it loud."
4,This is A revelation in Popular Music!,"Everclear is one of the greatest groups of the late 90's! They are a bench mark to popular music! Songs like "" Father mof mine"" which is the ultimate F&@K YOU to Art Alexakis's absent father, and songs like the title song, and everything to everyone are sure hits!"
5,This is the best cd ever,"I love everclear and I was surprised at the great quality of their newest cd, so much for the afterglow. It has great listening from the beginning of it to the end. There are so many different instruments thrown in to captivate the listener's attention. I would reccomend it to all!"
3,EVERCLEAR-What I Think,"I bought this cd when I was in the 7th grade (i'm 19 now)I like songs on here especially ""I'll Buy You a New Life"" ,""Father Of Mine"", ""Amphetamine"",""AfterGlow"",""Everything To Everyone"" etc... some of the songs on here though I haven't been able to make it through so that is the reason I give it 3 stars."
5,These guys rock!,"Art saved my life. I totally relate to everything he sings and he's one of the most honest singers ever. He's also got a fantastic turn of phrase. Lyrics are completely unconventional. My favorite line of the CD is from a song called ""Normal Like You"" it's ""Just because you are Neurotic and Depressed doesn't mean that you're sad."" It's very true. No one understands that unless you have gone through it. Have a bad break up? Listen to Everclear. Have a crappy childhood but don't want to whine about it? Listen to Everclear. Just pissed off and had a bad day? Listen to 'em."
3,Awesome album,"One of the best albums I own. All the songs that made it to the radio are good, but as usual the radio goons missed the best songs on yet another album. Amphetamine and why i don't believe in god are probably the 2 best songs on the album. The opener, also the album title, is a great way to open things up. When the intro starts you are thinking to yourself, what the hell did i buy? But when the song kicks in Everclear starts rocking. This is a must buy"
5,the worst album by the best band,"This album is not NEARLY as good as everclear's Sparkle and fade or world of noise, but it is still the 3rd best album out. The standout tracks are the instrumental el distorto de melodica, and sunflowers (mny two favorites) other good ones are amphetimine, so much for the afterglow, normal like you, like a california king, and the hidden track at the end hating you for christmas. the song why I don't believe in got was originally done by lead singer alexakis's previous group colorfinger (who I think was better than everclear) and it was called culver palms back then , and it was their soft song (and it is this album's soft song too.) I think that this version is better. All in all, I think that this album is a little to pop-ish for a band that would onece flick you off for calling them pop. the next album is supposed to be pop-ish too, but the followup album will be more heavy like earlier everclear. I can't wait for that one..."
5,One of my favorites,"This is a great CD, filled with personal lyrics and awesome riffs. I've had this CD for a year and I still love it as much as I did when I first got it.The title track opens with an interesting Beach Boys-esque harmony then...BOOM! Art Alexakis sings about ""the girl next door"" while he and his band play a loud guitar riff. ""Normal Like You"" is pretty good song and ""One-Hit Wonder"" has to be one of my favorite tunes of the last decade. At first it goes over your head, but when you notice how amazing it is you can't get enough. ""Like A California King"", a song about poseurs, and the bonus track make a great ending to this CD."
2,all the songs are the same,"An example of how similar all the songs on this cd are was demonstrated on the radio. As one of the songs on this album was ending, the DJ sang the lyrics to another everclear song. Needless to say, the lyrics fit perfectly. Everclear came up with one decent tune, and put half the songs on this cd to those three chords.When I listen to this cd, I keep thinking that the repeat button is stuck on my cd player because of all the songs that seem to copy each other."
5,GREAT!,"I bought this CD along with another, expecting the other to be better than this one, I WAS WRONG! This CD is my favorite, it has sooo many songs that could, and should be played on the radio besides ""Father of Mine"" I especially like ""Sunflowers"", ""I will buy you a new life"", ""White Men in Black suits"", ""one hit wonder"" and plus all the other songs R GREAT!! BUY THIS CD!!"
5,Stop Whining,"Yes, I have heard some complaints about this CD. But if you do not want to hear the ""same"" three chords in a row, buy another CD!! Is it that hard? And also, if you don't want to hear the lyrics from everclear's everyday problems, well just don't! Get another CD if it's that bad, and quit whining! I you didn't like this CD, talk to me about it. Anyway, This CD Rocked and anyone who has heard and liked a previous Everclear Album, this is the new and improved them. Buy this puppy, you won't regret it unless you're a whiner!"
3,"This is a good CD, though seems too happy to be Everclear","Perhaps it is just me, but this CD Is not the Eveclear I know. Most a collection of love songs and laments on life, the CD is a new beginning for the band where they stray from the punk stylings. Allthough, some songs seem to be right out of Sparkle & Fade (the groups last release), most of it is new ground and seems to be a completely diffrent band. Highlights: ""Everything to Everyone"" & ""Ampethamine."""
4,This cd is a classic and everybody must listen to it!!,Everclears so much for the after glow has got to be one of my favorite cds because of the catchy tunes and the good lyrics. there are some problems like the band only knows how to play in 4/4 time witch after a while it gets kind of annoying and all of his songs are about how he hates his dad. but all in all this is a good cd.
5,everclear kicks a good one,"this is one of my favorite albums right now. i am listening to it right now. i keep playing it over and over, and never really tire of it. the whole album is good, it plays well. amphetimine is one of my faves.."
5,Songs for every mood.,"This album is their best yet. No matter what mood you are in, there is a song on this album for it. Alexakis' lyrics are great and the bass of Chris Montoya is very good. One of the best albums I have ever heard. One of their lesser known songs ""Sunflowers"" is my favorite song. Everclear will be great. I can't wait for their next album."
4,Way to Go Everclear!,"So Much For The Afterglow is a great CD because it manages to express anger and sadness without sinking into the whining that afflicts so many rock bands today. Art Alexakis is a great songwriter, and I admire his storytelling abilities. There isn't a song on this album that I don't like. Well worth the money!"
5,Wow!,"As soon as you start listening to this cd you know that it's going to be great. Right from 'Everything to Everyone' to the wonderful 'Father of Mine', every single song has some kind of sparkle..this cd really did it for me, you can tell, can't you?"
1,This is the worst song I've ever heard!!!,"Everclear sucks. Their Songs all sound the same and they are all about awful,sad things. They stink!!!!"
1,Self-limiting,"I listened to this whole album in a CD listening station. Sorry, I don't get it. Bands nowadays seem to WANT to pigeonhole themselves into just ONE particular sound (spread out across an entire album -- or an entire CAREER for that matter). Perhaps it is because they don't have any more imagination than this, or perhaps it is because they are simply targeting a particular market, or perhaps they think they have some sort of image to uphold and will be ""selling out"" if they change anything about it -- including the music.Whatever it is, it produces a whole lot of bands with ""attitude,"" and a whole lot of awful dreck. And a whole lot of songs that sound almost exactly the same. Too bad. I found myself hating most of the music that comes out today, and listening to old stuff more than ever before."
5,I loved this movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie, there were plenty of twists and the actors were great."
3,Loves Mary Higgins Clark,"While this movie is not an atrocious mess like another Mary Higgins Clark movie I have previously viewed(A Cry in the Night), it still had much to be desired. The choice of actors and actress were rather pathetic as the acting skills they displayed were minimal, at best. The emotions were not present. The elements that were used in the novel were not present in the movie where they could have been used quite spendidly and the plot was too rush. Also, the relationship between the main character and her best friend was not expounded on enough so the viewers could not really understand the extent of her grief when she was murdered. I believe the only good actresses were used in a part too small to characterize them properly. All in all, it is an enjoyable movie but not a memorable one."
5,It is working perfectly in my old Dell Dimension XPS 4100,"I couldn't ask for more. It dropped right in and worked flawlessly. I connected it to a 4-port 3.5 inch front-bay USB 2.0 hub using the internal USB port, and that's working just fine too. The hardest part on that was prying out and breaking off the little metal bay cover that the Dimension 4100 uses for RF resistance. Now I have so many USB ports it's almost ridiculous. I have all of my toys connected and still have ports left over."
1,Belkin 5 port USB not good,"I am running Win 2000 pro SP4, w/SOYO Dragon Plus motherboard SY-K7V on my pc and the USB drivers have been a problem. I have had to reinstall them several times and the system has a hard time finding them on the disk. Very little support at the Belkin web site as well. I have gotten the card to run and when it does its great. But when you reboot it trys and fails to reinstall the hardware. I would not recommend this for anyone seeking to add USB 2.0 ports to their pc."
1,Not as advertised,No drivers in Windows 2000 as the installation manual says. No drivers on website as manual says. Doesn't even recognize the model number on the Belkin website. Talked to customer service and the only solution they had was to send a CD in 3-7 days. It's going back. What junk.
1,Worst item ever!,"I recently bought this card to add on to my HP desktop computer. The card went in easy enough, but that's when the problems started. I put in the disk that came with the card, but over and over my computer wouldn't recognize the card or the program on the disk. I kept having problems occur one after another and other programs starting to fail due to this mess. After almost losing the computer on the second occasion, I was forced to take the card out of the computer. All problems ended immediately! I've had no problems with Belkin's cords and wires, but their cards and hubs, I've had nothing but trouble. Do yourselves a favor and don't get this item. It could cause you nothing but your entire computer to crash. It's not worth your hard earned money to see your computer crash and burn, is it? If you need to add a card, find yourselves a different brand. I, myself, am going to try Adaptec. Hopefully that one won't cause me the problems that I have gotten with this one."
2,disappointing,"If you think that spending nearly $50 for a costume slip is worth it, this may be OK. for you. When we unpacked and shook out the slip, we thought it wasn't even the same slip, but zooming in, I can see that it is, in fact, the same- one can see the edge of the bustier through the fabric of the slip. I think perhaps it is the fact that the image is cut out and pasted on a white background that makes it look more opaque.Basically, there is one layer of nylon, with a draw-string- not even an elastic waistband, and at the hip ONE layer of tulle netting, each tier gathered into the one above. It would not support much weight in a skirt over it- anything more than a filmy fabric will crush it down. To hold a classic poodle skirt shape, one would need several of these, which could be built for about two bucks and an hour's work. Only those in a great hurry or no ability to sew at all will find this worth while.This is costume, not clothing underpinings."
3,remembering karen carpenter,"If you just want to see a video about little flicks(not the whole song) when karen carpenter was alive then this dvd is for you, but if you are looking for the carpenter songs to listen to and sing along to then that wont happen. They start to play the video and you start singing and then they cut in with talking. VERY DISAPPOINTING, THIS DVD."
3,Not Impressed,"There is no doubt that you need to cushion your baby's head in the carseat...however, from using this product, my baby would become all sweaty since in addition to just the headrest, the material covers his whole back. I ended up using receiving blankets around his head and this was a waste of money. My son was born in July, so that could have been a factor...but regardless, I don't plan on using this product with my future children."
2,Not worth It!!!,"We registered for the headrest because I thought it may be useful to use in the bouncy seat while my son was just a newborn...but after we tried it about 10 times...we decided to just use blankets!!! It's just to flimsy!!! It may work okay in a carseat where there are walls to stop it from folding over, but it doesn't work if there isn't anything supporting the head rest! I would not recommend it for use other than a car seat."
4,Great product,I loved this product! I used the inner portion for my son in his bouncy seat after we quit using it in the carseat - he got too tall. The only thing I would change would be to have directions included in the package on how to install - it was a little confusing for me at first.
1,Deceptive,"I bought one of these thinking it was made in America, but the ""Made in China"" label proved me wrong. These are NOT made in America from sustainable harvested whatever at a local sawmill in the Catskills. They are Chinese-made items. I returned mine for a refund because of this, and will never buy another item from Catskill ""Crafstmen."" No fault of Amazon that I can see, but the manufacturer's description is deceitful. Do not buy expecting American-made.Overall, the quality of the item seemed fine, but I will get a different one from a manufacturer that accurately represents their products."
2,For Beginners Only,"I've been a Filemaker Developer for over 7 years. My bookshelves are lined with a variety of FM titles. That said, I purchased this book solely on the authors experience (they frequently contribute to FM Advisor Magazine). The techniques shown here are pretty much available within the documentation and tutorials included within Filemaker when you do a standard install.The examples and layouts are bland- functional but bland. I suggest spending 1/3 less $ and finding the John Mark Osbourne-Matt Petrowsky CD sets. They pack their CDs with great layouts and designs as well as very advanced scripting and calculation information. I still rely on those CD's frequently.These gents do know Filemaker, and the text and CD do a fine job of explaining very basic database terms, expressions, and design theory. If you are brand new to databases and Filemaker specifically- this would do an adequate job."
4,are you still sucking??,"Thumbsucker takes us into the world of suburban America, warts and all. It's a look into the All American stereotypes and fantasies that we buy into, which ultimately fail (us). There's the main teenage character, who has a thumbsucking fetish which is a kind of reaction to the lack of support as a child. He doesn't fit in, and is socially awkward. His parents are struggling to love one another, his father being a washed up football star, his mother a rehab nurse. It's a movie which kind of sprawls everywhere with quirky and slightly neurotic characters. It's the peripheral characters, played by Vince Vaughn and Keanu Reeves which I think give this movie the added comedic kick. Probably, some of the best roles of their careers, I think.As a post-modern coming of age story, it does the job well."
5,great original film,"Great performances. keanu even delivers some hilarious moments. The girlfriend-if you can call her that- is smoking hott and sexy as the teenage girl ""discovering herself."" And let's not forget Vince Vaughn. heck, even Benjamin Bratt pulls out a character far from past roles that fits perfect into the flow of the film -and pretty dang funny. buy it."
3,Do it in your mind.,"I found this movie to be fairly entertaining. Getting Vince Vaughn, Keanu Reeves and Vincent D'Onofrio to play parts in this independent feature also helped the face value of the project. I feel that without this cast, the movie may have gone unnoticed and uncelebrated at Sundance, although the kid who plays the lead does a pretty good job.It's worth a viewing."
5,Geart movie,"When this movie came out in threatres me and my freind and ran out to go see it. After watching it we were just speechless. It's one of those movies that will just put you in that certin mood, you know that in awe profound mood. I guess the movie had that affect on me and my freind because Justin resembled Chad (my friend) and Rebecca resembled me a lot when i was that age. I think it was a great movie so i gave it 5 stars."
2,"Typical ""Festival Film""","At every film festival I attend I expect to find a film like this; a heartwarming coming-of-age story where a young person overcomes adversity while discovering themselves. Usually they live in a star-studded household and/or have at least one B-list mentor. THUMBSUCKER delivered all of the above in spades with stars in all of the ""supporting"" roles. Ably directed by Mike Mills, THUMSUCKER hits all of its cues and lacks any sour notes. It's a fun albeit trite little movie and is sure to play incessantly on cable soon."
3,Middling...,"I remember the book being really good, but this movie about a teen who's still sucking his thumb definitely wasn't. Sure, there are tender scenes - Keanu Reeves is surprisingly good, and so are lookalikes Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio - but Tilda Swinton is surprisingly boring, the main guy is so totally unforgettable that we still never understand from him why his parents' marriage is troubled, why he sucks his thumb, why he takes Prozac, and why his 10-year-old brother has more characer than he does..."
4,Great cast,"For such an obscure movie, this has a lot of big watt talent. Coming of age tale about a troubled teen who sucks his thumb. What's the point? I really don't know, but the pace is quick enough to carry the film along, and the script is very intelligent. Well worth watching."
2,"Thumbsucker, well, it sucks","I know a lot of people had high hopes for this movie, but it shouldn't be surprising as to how badly it tanked at the box office. It's just the latest in this wave of movies like ""Garden State"" where we just see how eccentric a cast we can create; the more offbeat, the better.The problem is, does anyone care about this kid? He has ADD and debates and he is apparently, a master debater, but he's such a dweeb. Vince Vaughn is wasted as the speech coach. He gives his kids beer the night before? Oh, that makes lots of sense.Loser characters in a loser movie."
2,a movie that tells about ateenager life and dealing with it,this dos have sex and violence and profanity and drug use but this hollywood movie is definetly dumb and annoying with havin big stars like keanu reeves vince vaughn tilda swinton and vincent donofrio and still cant put it together benjamin bratt plays a hippie type who is in a small part of the film they did show the movie in ny la it will come out in more states inseptember 30th it trys to be more of a waste of atime as it is its 2hrs long and not really doing much
3,Next teen movie,"A next movie of a teen entering adult world with exploring sexuality and new stuff aroung is rather comedy than a drama of ""in-between"" speculations.Funny and easy watching stuff."
4,A Cut Above The Rest.,"Sometimes I think I cannot bear seeing another coming of age film. It's one of two genres (the other being light romantic comedies) that studios and independents fall back on when they have nothing of substance to say. But I found THUMBSUCKER a cut above the rest. It's a somewhat idiosyncratic little gem that is well written and credibly acted by an impressive ensemble cast. I was paticularly impressed by Keannu Reeves who as an actor has never been taken too seriously by critics or hardcore cinephiles. He gave a wonderfully nuanced performance of a slightly whacky, but ultimately lovable orthodontist. Tilda Swinton, as always, was superb. And the young actor, Lou Pucci, who played the title role was remarkable. This offbeat excursion into teenage angst and the dark and often humurous corners of suburbia is well worth your effort."
4,Bitter-sweet Tale of Growing Up,"Thumbsucker tells the story of a 17 year old who still sucks his thumb. It shows what his family must go through when dealing with the problem. As well as what happens with his school and social life.This is a very truthful realistic story of teenage life and learning to grow up.The outstanding cast, makes this a fantastic movie. Keanu Reeves as the holistic orthodontist, Vince Vaughn as the high school debate team teacher are both outstanding."
1,Awful costume/don't waste your money!,"This is a terrible product. Poorly constructed and incredibly uncomfortable. The velcro is scratchy and my dog hates to wear it. I purchased this through an animal rescue site (not their fault I assure you) and paid considerably more than the price on Amazon. I actually have one from Big N Lots that I bought for $10 that is awesome, but not small enough for my mini weinie who weighs 11 lbs. This one from Canine is way too small & more along the lines of a stuffed dog costume instead of a real dog. Perhaps a puppy could manage to squeeze in but I doubt it. The material is incredibly cheap and there is no back to this one...just elastic string linking the ""mustard/ketchup"" to the buns. Seriously disappointed in this piece of junk!"
3,Small is REALLY small,Yorkie is 10 pounds- this will fit a 5 pound puppy. Cute idea but doesn't work if it doesn't fit. I donated it to my bro who just got a tiny puppy.
2,Not so wonderful,"I was very excited to get this costume for my basset hound, thinking he would look adorable. However, it fits strange. The bun part of it lays down very low... and its hard to see its suppose to be a hotdog. A little disappointing."
2,not for a large dog,"We have a lab, who weighs about 75 lbs and is very trim. This costume, while cute, looked very weird on him because it was way too small, and the velcro straps were too short. They should make the bun part larger to fit on the large dog siodes, not on his back. If I had to do it over, I would not buy it."
1,did not fit well,the costume didn't fit out dog well. not happy with it. Cost to much to return so we own it.
3,OKAY,I recieved this product with a hole in the product. I chose to keep it since it was only days to halloween and just sewed it up my self. I will not order agian.
3,fine for the price,"Pet costume was fine for the price I paid, but the Velcro pieces to go around the body of the animal was tight, and not true to the size."
3,Wrong sizej,Small size was too small for my dachshund. My dog is between a mini and regular. Would love it otherwise.
1,Dog Costume - Hot Diggity Dog Halloween Costume (Hot Dog w/Mustard) - Medium,"This one is not a good one buy , because they would not give a refund on this costume. It is really made to not stay on your doxie , because my will not us it. The money when down the drain instill."
1,Don't waste your money!,Terrible quality and even my miniature poodle couldn't fit in it! There is so much cheap black elastic that separates the mustard from the bun that when the costume is placed on the dog it stretches so far causing the bun to reside around the tummy of the pup...not close to the mustard at all. It looks of cheap quality and it is cheap quality.
4,Mustard Costume,The size chart seemed off. The small was too small for my dog and I had to exchange it for a medium.
1,Awful,This product had terrible quality for the price! The velcro was ripped and there was stuffing coming out of the bun and mustard. I would not buy it again!
3,my hot dog is a hot dog,"product shipped in a sealed bag. when i opened it, the costume was already falling apart. the straps that go around my dog were are chopped up. had to do a little surgery and sew it together. once fixed it stayed on him for about a half an hour until he decided to take a bite outta the buns and eat the mustard. after that he ended up ripping apart the straps and that was that."
2,Hot Diggity Dog Costume w/ Mustard was broken :(,"When the brand new Hot Diggity Dog Costume I ordered for my dachshund arrived in the mail, I took it out of the box and was disappointed to find the costume to be poorly constructed and falling apart. One of the elastic staps for holding the costume in place was not even attached to the costume, and the other strap was literally hanging on by a thread. The costume did arrive sooner than expected, but don't order this costume for your dog unless you plan to spend some time sewing and repairing this poorly crafted item."
1,hot dog costume,"Product is poorly made. One of the straps that hold the costume on was frayed upon opening the package. It lasted about five minutes on the dog before it tore completely. It can't be repaired by sewing because the type of stitch used on the strap just unravels. It is a cute costume, but I expect a product to at least be functional when first taken out of the package."
1,the worst thing i've ever purchased in my entire life.,"I don't even know where to begin with this....okay well for starters may the fact that the ""costume"" costs $8.00 should've been a huge sign that it probably wasn't the best product....but it was already torn when I opened the package. The velcro had torn apart....then when I put it on my dog the rest of the strings just all started coming out of the costume. After it fell apart and fell off of him it then went in the trash. Biggest waste of money ever."
3,Mustard??,"I absolutely loved this costume for our Rat Terrier. It didn't have any annoying hats or parts that were uncomfortable for her. She didn't even notice it was on after a few minutes she was taking a nap in it and playing like she didn't have anything on. The only issue I had with this purchase was that we ordered a mustard costume and recieved a Ketchup. I wrote emails in to get the issue resolved, but I never heard back."
4,looks adorable on my corgi,"I got a size Large for my 30lb corgi and it almost fits her perfectly - still slightly too small. On the packaging, the sizing chart lists corgis in ""Medium"" and retrievers and brittany spaniels in ""Large"", which, in my opinion, wouldn't fit them.My corgi absolutely hates it though, and has managed to wriggle out of it twice, so keep an eye on your dog when he/she is wearing it :)"
5,fabulous,"We love our hotdog halloween costume. Looks just as it was pictured. Delievered promptly, though sizing seems to run small."
4,very cute but sewing done poorly,These hot dog costumes are very cute and just a hoot to take the dogs for walks in. The reaction from people is very well worth it although the costumes did come apart in several places while using the first time.
4,hot dog diggity costume size S mustard,my puppy doxie looked absolutely adorable in this costume. a couple of minor flaws in the costume:1. the mustard was not sewed on to the strap intricately enough so it ended up coming off after two days. may need to sew it on tighter.2. for dogs who dont like to wear costumes (such as my puppy) it is easy to slip out of this.not everyone may have these problems but i did. other than that they are minor and probably somewhat expected - i would recommend this.
2,"cute, but smaller then expected","This costume is so cute, but the description said the small would fit our Jack Russell. We needed to get the medium instead."
3,Good Concept - Poor Quality,"Good:1) The layout, and the feel of the controller2) Being able to Jump and Melee without removing your right thumb off the stickBad:1) Buttons stick a lot - not reliable for when you need it.2) The Analog sticks have a little dead zone that makes aiming difficult.3) Aiming sensitivity is inconsistent in different directions - it's difficult to aiming quickly and accurately4) Aiming sensitivity is really bad - it's difficult to move the aiming-sight slowly to aim accurately... there's very little variation or consistency in aiming speed to how far you press the stick.Conclusions:1) The bad outweigh the good for overall FPS play.2) Good only if you plan to do nothing but melee or jump - in a shooting battle - you would lose miserably."
1,"Beware: It has a good feel, but it is JUNK","I was excited to get this controller for Halo. It didn't take that long to get used to, and it did feel very comfortable for slayer matches in Halo. However, after about one week I noticed that the buttons on the bottom would sometimes get ""stuck"", meaning I had to press them very firmly in order to change weapons or jump. This did get in the way of gameplay at some points. After one more week of use, probably less than 10 hours total playing time with this controller, the right trigger broke while playing Halo. The plastic snapped and the whole controller stopped working. Very disappointing. I returned it the next day and no longer recommend this cheaply made controller."
5,FPS Master is great.... when it's for the right counsel,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ITEM IS FOR THE PS2, NOT XBOX!!!!!I have used the Xbox version of this controller for many years and have been very pleased with it. You do have a small dead zone on both thumb sticks, but once you get use to it, you don't even notice it =)Without this controller I would not be a level 22 in Big Team Battle in Halo 2 =)"
5,What a voice!,"I am a Sam Cooke fan, but when I first listened to this album, I was really surprised. The quality of the recording is very good and Sam Cooke's voice is excellent. I can listen to all the songs in the album all day long without getting bored. I like Nat King Cole too, but Sam Cooke's Monalisa is the one that I keep hearing in my head. I think that this is my favourite Sam Cook album. I like it even better than his hits. Please excuse my English."
5,Great!,"Great book for adolescents interested in history. This is a suspenseful and fast-moving story of a young French boy who discovers a German radar installation during the WWII occupation, and then assists the Resistance in its plan to destroy it. I read this as a boy, and then re-read it aloud to my son. I enjoyed it even more the second time. Well done. Great adventure story for young adults with a good dose of historical insight. Read it if you can get a copy."
4,Got me hooked,"Coming from Germany, I never heard of Anne Murray before, until I came to the US and heard the songs in my landlady's kitchen - and immediatelly knew that I HAD to have this CD. The first CD in this album is good, just not 100% my music style, the second one was missing - but the 3rd one! Wow, that got me hooked. My favorites: ""Si jamais je te revois"" and ""Feed this fire"". The songs go straight to the heart. So I went and bought lots of Anne Murray CDs today, because she has such a wonderful voice and great lyrics. Also I like the diversity of the songs and styles and how it changed over the years without ever affecting the quality. This CD box is a great opportunity to get a glimpse of the whole variety. Ms. Murray, you have a new fan, compliments on your work!"
5,Anne's Very Best,"This box set is a must for any Anne Murray fan. All of her hits from ""Snowbird to Time Don't Run Out Me"" are here. In addition to the hits, there are a lot of previously unreleased songs, Live songs (""A Million More"" is just beautiful) and a great Spanish Version of her big hit ""Broken Hearted Me"". This collection covers the first 29 studio albums from Anne's career and does an excellent job showing the many different styles of music she has done over the years. A great collection of songs!"
2,Poorly recorded,The mixing and recording of this CD is poor. At times it sounds like it was recorded in a garage or basement. Very disappointed.
1,Murray Did it again,"Anne Murray Still Sounds Like She Got her cd recorded in a empty room or something, but she sings nice music."
4,Well worth it,"Connect your USB port to this player, transfer (copy) a folder(s) with your mp3 files (mine are 320kbps) and you can listen to Mitch Miller christmas music like I am. It took ten minutes to load 7 albums containing 150 songs using storage of 990mb.Suprizingly the display is very good and the dialogue in using the player is not difficult once you walk thru it.For the price and performance its a great gift for mp3 and wma users as opposed to IPOD.I would have given it 5 stars except:..... The documentation is too brief...... Its library feature captures Identification data stored in each track associated with the original album. There may be a conflict between your mp3 setup and the way this player sets up its library. This does not effect playabilty or use...... Some equalizer settings did not work well for some tracks--it may be my mp3 ripping...... The 3a battery that came with it was dead."
5,A wonderful text!,"This is a wonderful book by Geshe Kelsang explaining how to transfer everyday experiences into the Buddhist path. If you're looking for a practical guide to develop compassion this is the book for you. Thank you for reading my review, and I wish you much luck."
5,Perhaps my favorite Veggie Tales video yet!,"These videos are so clever. They include humor that only an older child or an adult would understand while still having great kid-appeal. This series is truly whole-family viewing material!In this particular episode, King George (aka Larry the Cucumber) is playing in the bath with his rubber duckie. He has a whole collection of duckies, but he spies a little guy taking a bath with *his* duckie from his window. (Think of David and Bathsheba here) Even though he has plenty of duckies, he wants the little guy's (Junior Asparagus') duckie!Before the story begins, Jimmy and Jerry gourd try to take Bob and Larry's place introducing the show - with hilarious results!I guarantee you'll love this video - it's for children of ALL ages!God bless you all and check out my other reviews!"
5,A great episode,"I really liked this episode. It's not my favorite Veggietales episode, but it is a great one. Archibald tries to run the show for once and is frustrated as things don't go his way. Kids learn how to share."
3,not as good as previous veggies,"I'm sorry to rain on the parade. I love Veggie Tales. Come to my house and look at my clock. Come see my cups and my keychain. But in all honesty, this video was flat. It is definitely not their best work. The silly song is very good and very catchy. My fiancee has taken to calling her stuffed manattee ""Barbara."" But that aside, the video was subpar for them. I hold them to high standards, and I was disappointed. The music wasn't that memorable. The lesson is good, but the writing is uninspired. The songs seemed forced. Maybe Big Idea needs a sabatical to recharge the batteries. I hope this is an aberation and not a sign of decline. The impression I got was a lot of hard work went into this, but something did not click. Reviews like this one, especially revolving around humor, are necessarily subjective. But without any doubt, I would not hesitate to get this for a child. This is far superior to the normal pap and dribble coming out of the industry."
3,Cute and creative but....,"My four year old loves this video. The story is very creative and because he is also a bit obsessed with rubber ducks.. he gets it!I do have one caution for parents of very young children.. I you do not want your little ones using phrases like ""Do you want a piece of me?!?"" skip the beginning of the video. Yes, the story about the Englishman who went up the hill is cute. However, the disagreement between Jimmy and Jerry over the name of the selfish friend in their letter has caused me some concern. This is when you will hear that phrase in the video. My son latched on to that phrase immediately. As parents of preschoolers know all too well, once some new phrase gets into their vocabulary it is very hard to eliminate. Bad Judgement from Big Idea.Without that one line, the video is a solid 4 stars."
5,Wonderful movie about selfishness,"I think this is a great movie to teach young kids about selfishness. My daughter can easily watch this movie about 3 times in a row! As an adult, my heart has been convicted while watching this movie!"
5,The best film I've seen in a long time.,"This is an absolutely fantastic film. It's beautiful and simple as it follows four friends as they say goodbye. It isn't very often I find a movie that is both heart-warming and heart-breaking simultaneously, but this one is. It's truely believable throughout both playfullness and tears. Highly recommended."
5,must see,"Astounding film! Took me through a full spectrum of emotions, from big belly laughter to heart breaking sadness. very very moving. SEE IT"
4,Heavy Comedy/Drama,"Like any movie about cancer, the end was really heartbreaking, but the lead up to the end was a thought provoking and wonderful journey. The movie starts at James' 29th birthday, his last because cancer will take his life before his next birthday. His three best friends agree to take him camping to his favorite place on Earth. Their trek to the site is full of mishaps and a meeting with a truly interesting beachcomber. There are plenty of laughs, as you would expect with four best friends, but there's also some truly touching and sad moments as well.It's a very heavy movie, grab some tissues."
5,A Must-See,"This movie was so beautiful. The scenery was fantastic, and all of the actors were amazing. This movie made me laugh, it made me think, and by the end it had me literally sobbing face down in the floor. But I watch it over and over again!"
2,Dumb coming-of-age movie,"I rented this because I love Benedict Cumberbatch and I'm trying to find and watch the work he did before ""Sherlock"". This film is British (I am American), and the actors mumble and josh around with each other and make comments under their breath, so without subtitles, I was semi-lost. And since it's a dialogue-driven film, not being able to understand them seriously hindered my enjoyment, of course. I will say that Benedict is *gorgeous* in this movie-- he plays a young man tragically dying of cancer, and he's convincing in his portrayal of the physical problems his character deals with-- fatigue, debility, severe pain, dependence on pain meds, as well as the expected emotional problems of fear, despair and ruthlessly facing his own demise."
4,Above Average,"This was the 3rd game I purchased for XBox, I got an XBox on the 4th of July, wanted to wait until some fun games came out.Anyway, the main problem I have with this game is the ... cutscenes. Some you can skip, and some you can't. BIG turnoff. I don't want to sit through a 2 minute cutscene again after a boss kills me.Second of all, no cheats. Don't get me wrong. This game wasn't extremly difficult. It would just be fun if you could go back and have infinite ammo or something. Not to mention picking certain levels. I loved the Civil War level, I'd love to go back with infinite gatling gun ammo. But sadly, no level select either.The arcade mode is probably the most difficult part of the game, too many damn deadites!All in all, it's a fun game. Not much replay value (unless you wait and forget how to solve some puzzles) but it's incredibly fun, ...! Stop being so stingy!"
4,The good book,"This game is really fun. Great weapons and magic spells. Don't expect it to change the way games are played or viewed, but it has a great quality to it that makes it different. The game is solid and the "" to do "" mission aren't very easy but not overly complicated. Ash has a great personality and his humor is "" ash "" the only way to put it. The only complaint I have about this game is the camera angle. It is the most confusing to get used to. It wouldn't be so bad but you constantly need to view all around you. There are so many zombies attacking you at once, that the camera falls short into taking full advantage. Holding the left trigger, aiming, while running helps. For the price, this game is worth playing or renting."
4,groovy,"the latest in the evil dead series is a good one. this new third person action title delievers much of the wit and humor that comes along with the evil dead series. you play ash, which is voiced by the one and only bruce campbell. the cinematics of the game are amazingly good and look excellent running on the xbox. the gameplay is pretty good but can get confusing when you have about 12 deadites on your screen. another great thing is when you do have 12 deadites on your screen and blood and severed limbs flying around, the game doesn't lag up or give you any problems. the weapons are pretty good, you start off with nothing, but it isn't long before you get yourself a shotgun and the classic chainsaw attachment. the graphics in game are decent. the best part is the fact that its a good evil dead game at a terrific price. makes you almost forget about the atrocity that was ""evil dead: hail to the king""."
2,Not that fun,If you are a fan of the Evil Dead series you will probably get this game. But don't think that it will be awsome.The storyline of the game is pretty cool but the gameplay is very bad. The controling to the game can sometimes be difficult. This game seems like it was rushed.When you have killed a zombie and keep on moving then comes the same zombie you just killed. It is non stop action. But it starts to get quite boring after a half an hour of playing. Most of the missions in the game are quite tedious. The graphics aren't that good either.The only cool thing about it is that Bruce Cambell provides his voice for the game. He gives a couple of his cheesy one liners from the three movies. Overall i would not recomend this game to you because it ain't fun.
1,senseless garbage,"For starters, this is my brother's game, but I tried it out for like, fifteen minutes, before I got so bored I turned it off. This game is a pointless shoot 'em up where all you do is run around shooting this or sawing that. It's entertaining for a little bit watching the zombies fall apart at the hands(or blades) of Ash's chainsaw. But it's only a matter of time before the gameplay becomes so redundant you have no will to continue playing because all you do is chop stuff up(and what's with the strip clubs everywhere?!).There ARE spells that attempt to add some depth to the game, but when the day is over, you're left with the same shoot and slash garbage you started with when you turned the game on. Anyone into these kind of games should check out the Hunter games instead. They have better variation in weapons, and you can play with a friend. I would not recommend this game to ANYONE unless they're a die hard fan of the Evil Dead series."
1,All instrumental !!,I wished I had learned somewhere that there is no vocals on this CD. All these French songs are known for their lyrics. Having only instrumental versions of these songs is not worth it !!BORING !
4,Votre meilleur coupable plaisir!,"Yes, this is one of the best Ultra-lounge CDs, and not just because it tries to transport you into the super-chic world of France, as viewed from the eyes of soon-to-be-too-hip-to-care Americans. Unlike many of the CDs in this set, Bachelor in Paris lands beaucoup points for actual sentiment here, even with the sometimes annoying fake French dame who pops up every now and then. The renditions of the most famous stuff (""La Vie en Rose"", ""April in Paris"", ""Milord"") are pretty unique, and you can still never say that Sam Butera didn't put every ounce of his soul into his horn. My faves are the lesser known, like ""French Rat Race"" (Manhatten Transfer eat your hearts out!) and ""Under Paris Skies/La La Collette"" which may be the single corniest (yet wonderful) performance in the ultra lounge series. Overall, tout à fait beau, and so lovely on a temperate spring afternoon."
4,Paris Never Could Have Been This Good!,"I took a flyer on a used copy of this CD, based on how much I liked some of the other Ultra-Lounge discs, and much to my surprise this has been a favorite. Particular surprise: the most bouncy light-hearted cover of ""La Vie En Rose"" ever committed to vinyl."
3,Why the Talking?!,"I have four of the Ultra Lounge albums, and love them. The selections are great! BUT - on this one, the producers went overboard, adding in a pseudo-French chick between the tracks saying stuff like, ""oh, ze lovairs in Paris yadda yadda yadda."" Talk about spoiling a great cd!"
2,If your a Fan!!!!,"The reason I bought this DVD is because Hogan Squares off against my favorite wrestler of all times Triple H!!!And I wasn't wrong!!The only good match is the main event, with lots of action, interfearences from the Undertaker and Jerico, and Hogan becoming the WWE Champion, which makes it a classic!!If you are a Hulkamaniac, this DVD is good!!"
2,Hogan [stinks],"This p.p.v was terrible. THe main event was terrible. I hate seein the wwe making hHh job to the likes of an over the hill hogan. The card on a whole wasnt terrible but the main event was such a dissapointment it makes the whole p.p.v just [smell]. There were a couple of good matches such as kidman vs. tajiri,edge vs. angle and rvd vs. guerreo. I wuld recomend buying though b/c of those 3 matches.If you want a great all around card go to shopzone and buy judgment day 2002. This was awesome especially the hell in a cell between y2j and hHh."
5,backlash,"i went to the pay-per-veiw in kansas city, i was sittin front row at the event. it was a great show!!SO here is the card with five stars = the bombcruserweight title:Billy kidman vs. tajiri*****bradshaw vs. scott hall**women's title:Jazz vs. trish*Jeff hardy vs. Brock lesnar*****Edge vs. Kurt angle*****intercontinental title:R-V-D vs. Eddie Guerrero****Austin vs. Undertaker (ric flair=special guest ref)*****tag title:Billy/chuck vs. Al snow/maven***Undisputed title:Triple H Vs. Hogan*****you should get the video because it was an awsome pay-per-veiw!SO BY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome!!!,"I was in 4th grade in 02, and a humongus HHH fan.I live by Kansas City,where Backlash was at, and kc is only 1 hr away. I had been beggin to go to Backlash and my mom said no. Then, the night before my sister called and said she had to ticketS!!! I went and didnt get home till 11pm it was so cool when i got home i was so excited, and had a very strong hate for taker (Not any more, now HHH is a loser). All the matches are superb except the tag match, because i am not big on tag matches. The matches from best to last go1.HHH vs Hogan2.Edge vs Kurt Angle3.Undertaker vs Stone Cold4. The Rest are all tied except the tag match is last."
2,a match that made edge into a star by Joe Brown,Edge vs Kurt AngleKurt Angle carried Edge 2 his best singles match i have ever seen some spots and counters in this match was nice 2 see and each men took their share of bumps this is da last match we would c kurt angle with his hair because next month at judgement day he lost his hair to edge in a rematch that wasn't as good as this match their backlash match rating ****1/4
3,One unforgettable match,"Backlash was an Ok paperviewThe main Event was what I was looking to see.I really wanted to watch HHH/HOGAN match with out interferrance.Sadly it was from my favorite WWE star, the Undertaker.Though the match was awesome it just didn't hold it up for me.Austin/Taker match wasn't a big deal for me Because It was nothing important except that it's for the no1 contender for the wwe championship....I give this 3 stars for the match and theBIG SHOW/SHANE match which stole the show for me.These two men flat out killed eachother.This was better than there match at Judgmentday which was 2/3 years ago I think....Over all don't buy this PPv....Borrow if from a friend or something....Or buy, It's up to you....I'm not forcing anyone not to watch it.I thought this was an average/and yes awesome ppv to watch...3.2 out of 5"
1,complete [disappointment]!!!,backlash 2002 was just a bad ppv. i dont see why anybody would like this event. it just plain [disappointed]. the matches were slow and had [terrible] endings. but thi wasnt the worst ppv of the year. king of the ring was.
3,Tsubo Maryjane shoes,"They are cute, but not as comfortable as I expected them to be. I also found them to run a little small-they are wearable, but would be more comfortable a half-size higher. I would have been really disappointed if I had paid full price for them."
4,Better than average compilation,"A good cross-section of material. The remixes make it more interesting than the typical compilation. Problems: the Heart of Glass ""remix"" isn't the one that was originally done exclusively for this package and another pre-existing recording (Atomic) was added unnecessarily."
3,"Some cool remixes, some overdone remixes","This is a good compilation of hard-to-find Debbie Harry hits & those mixes are well-done. Some of the ""classic"" Blondie tunes, though, have been re-mixed excessively. ""Rapture"" comes off well & is still ahead of its time. During ""Call Me,"" though, you wish someone would hang up!! For fans, this is a good grouping, but it could've been better with a little less tampering with the classics."
3,Long lost CD of Blondie remixes,"The best thing about this CD is the front cover. Besides that the only song that really benifits from the updating (this CD was released in 1987 if I remember correctly) is Rapture, the remix really does enhance the rap and funk style of the song. Besides that only a couple of the songs make this CD anything noteable, Heart of Glass is passable, Call Me is OK. Denis and The Tide is High are bloody terrible. Backfired ?... Just when you think it can't get any worse."
1,Made Both of My 1GB SD cards Worthless,"I was happy when I got it, so I inserted my Sandisk 1GB SD card and try to transfer data from my notebook, My SD card freezed and became worthless. I was not sure that this card reader was the reason, so I tried my other 1GB Sandisk Ultra II and had the same problem (Thank god it was under warranty). I bought Lexar JumpDrive Trio and it was the right choice.PS: This review is about Bonzai's new version. I tried the old version with no problems at all."
2,Be Careful: Not compatible with all SD cards,The newest version of the SD cards (Ultra or Hi-Speed) ar not readable with this device. Make sure you have a standard or older version or an SD card before purchasing
5,Value for money !,"One of the best products I bought under $10. The SD card clicks into place, which I did not observe in other card readers that I have seen. I have a 2 GB SD card & I can use it as a flash drive."
1,"Shipping and ""handling""",Why does it take $7.99 to ship a 2-ounce package? Instead of buying here I purchased a card reader elsewhere for only $2.99 to ship.
1,Mine didn't work.,Mine didn't work right out of the box. Simple Tech promised to exchange it for another.
1,Amazon do you sell anything anymore?,"If I wanted to buy things from other websites, I would go to other websites. I do appreciate the fact the expanded product line up, but when I hit the add to shopping cart button on the right side of the screen and it doesn't say anything to the contrary IT BETTER BE COMING FROM AMAZON. I'm getting tired of finding out after the fact that the one 6 dollar item I have in my cart from ""RippoffCrap dot com"" has a ten dollar S & H fee. Fix this or your going to find me buying elsewhere.As far as the card reader goes it works fine, I've had several of them before."
2,Too big,"It is too big for using directly in your USB slot, but it is practical if what you need is not to lose your card reader easily. Works perfect!!"
4,It works....with a little help,"The reader has a spring loaded plastic door that is supposed to hold the chip in contact with the reader contacts... Sometimes it does but most time, one has to leave the door open and push the chip in.... Luckily it loads fast or else you may have to grow an extra arm....On the positive side; the price was right"
1,Car seat safety,"This is an okay product if parents understand that it is NOT to be used with a carseat according to NHTSA standards. Aftermarket products are not safe for use in vehicles and many children are injured because of their use. It is, however, excellent with the baby's swing."
3,Be forewarned!,"This is a well made piece on the modern world of internet profiling and the current and impending collapse of freedom. Most of this movie is factual and well presented. However, it throws in a very biased ""Christian"" slant in the end. I was disappointed in the ending. Facts are important these days. Religious bias is old paradigm and counterproductive for survival. Respect to all religions and all beings everywhere! We are our own shadow govt. We need to correct ourselves and let go of our own angers, fears and bitterness. Knowledge is power but action is life! To anyone out there profiling us and suppressing their fellow humans, shame on you. Get a real job and get a life! Profiling is creepy. The only way to truly know someone is to speak with them face to face. Let's bring this shadow govt. into the light!"
3,"Gets a liitle ""weird""","Pretty much a given that privacy is a thing of the past, damn shame too. If there is still anyone out there that does not believe every move can be tracked you're living in la la land. Far too many lame do nothing losers in this country any more to make a difference I fear. While I waste my breath almost every day trying to convince people I work with or meet that voting is so very important many alleged Americans just can't be reached, they are too dependent on the government, just plain blind, or flat out brainwashed stupid. As for the movie, it's just some of the references to cults, the devil, etc. that make it lose some credibility. Still, it may get some thinking about the subject more."
1,Total Disappointment,This film seemed more of a political advertisement than a documentary. It would never have been ordered if I had known what a shallow film it was.
3,Excellent video until the Christian prophecy nonsense at the end,"The video is well made, makes great arguments and has excellent proof points. And then at the very end of the video... they open the Bible and start talking about Bible prophecy. Why? There was no need to go there. The video should be entitled ""How the Shadow Government will Suppress Christians"". So if you want a 5 star video skip the last 10 minutes."
2,Shoptrist,"I love the CD as for the first 10 songs; songs 11 though 14 do not play; there is lots of static in song 11; 12 there is nothing, I have to forward to song 13 and 13 and 14 songs; again lots of static. I would love to receive another new CD."
5,"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus","Awesome! Blessed! I am so gratefule. I waited at least two motnhs for this CD. I kept hearing Jesus,Jesus, Jesus... but is was not available for sale. I thank God for the CD and Rev. Wright. God Bless you Rev. Timothy Wright.RVP"
3,Great Music,"As always, I am definitely pleased with this cd. Rev. Timothy Wright always produced traditional gospel music that stirs the soul. Thank you."
3,Downgrade one size...,"Very nice top! I bought the X-Large as I do with all of my tops, but the 'cut' of this shirt is very wide. I would recommend to downgrade one size."
2,"Misleading Title - a Thesis, not an Overview","This is not a general introduction or overview text, as the title suggests but a thesis that with about two Gothic structures only: Suger's St.Denis abbey church in Paris and Notre-Dame de Chartres cathedral. These two structures appear only to serve the writer's thesis: that medieval christian aesthetics are light and harmoneous geometry with harmonic ratios. The pictures in this book are B&W; concetrated in the middle and offer no advantage on what you could find on the internet or other books.To conclude, this book is for academicals and scholars and not for the general audience. For an introduction to Gothic architecture I suggest Christopher Wilson's ""The Gothic Cathedral"" (with only B&W; pictures unfortunately, but still, they are many and are very illustrative) or Ralf's Thoman ""Gothic"" with many colored photoes.Reviewed by Zachi Evenor"

2,what the hell???,ok What the hell....i just spent 70 on a pair of sunglasses that don't fit!!! unless you have the same size head as a baby then these sunglasses are going to be to small>>>>they only look cool>
2,expired product,"The original shipment of the Liquid Chlorophyll was with the expired date of 02/2012.When I wrote the fit back of the product, I've got the replacement from the company with the same expiration date and my account was charged by $7.40..When I wrote again the complain, my account was credited by this amount. What about original charge of this product that I cannot use?Should I send it back to have the credit?"
3,Check first...,"I registered for this item without checking to see if my carseat included this item. Check to make sure before you go out and purchase one. Otherwise, if your carseat DOES NOT have it I think it would be extremely useful and appropriate for your little baby."
2,Tugboat Babs,"Tugboat Babs has finally written her memoir. She is in the weird situation of having been married to one president and having spawned another. She is most informative on the Bush's early years together -- although she provides very little information on the family's connection with the Medellin cartel. She is also mum on Laura's vehicular homicide conviction.All in all, it is a tale to rank with that of the Sopranos."
2,"Stolid but not always tiresome, traditional reading","Perhaps not so bad as far as political memoirs go. Though no one is reading this with the hopes of finding a private Hunter S. Thompson, Bush does have a certain kind of humor and consistency about her. Republicans will probably enjoy this book, Democrats will probably find it tinged with just a hint of gender inequality. One can not help, in the present era, of thinking ""Let us see if Hilary will do any better.&quot"
3,Fairly Interesting,"If you have any interest in the mothers of Presidents, this book is fairly interesting. If you have any interest in luminous women political figures, this book is a bit more interesting. If you have no interest in either, this book is less than interesting. Any questions?"
1,A Big Letdown,"I was really disappointed after reading this book. I didn't get any tips for raising my own children to be great leaders. I really admire Bush's faith and power to advance his interests. I really want my children to be the same way, but this just left me without any idea what to do."
5,I was having a fascinating history lesson!,"I wanted more stories, more letters, more diary entries, more anecdotes, more pictures and most DEFINITELY more years with George as President and Mrs. Bush as First Lady! I loved every word for its warmth and humor and depth and perception. I envy those Mrs. Bush refers to as ""our dearest friend."" Although it made me want to cry for what we lost in '92, it also made me want to celebrate Mrs. Bush's life by adopting her motto of ""faith, family and friends."""
4,Behind the scenes of a First Lady's life in politics.,"In this book, Barbara Bush proves that the wife of a president,vice president and politition is not alway easy. She tells many amusing stories of her expeirences with many famous people (both bad and good) and gives an insiders look at important historical events that were part of her husbands career. This book gives you a better look at the job and hectic schedule that a First Lady is responsible for (even though she is not paid.) Her viewpoints on her responsibilities as a First Lady, a Wife and Mother are refreshing. It seems like she was able to ""do it all"" and ""have it all"" and do it well. After reading this book it is easy to see why she is one of the country's favorite First Lady's."
3,"Interesting, but too detailed and chatty","Descibes an interesting era in American politics but focuses on family life, personal matters. The energy and time used in campaining is impressive. The role of Mrs.Bush surely is more important than I imagined before reading her book. Would be glad to interview her if possible."
2,Boring,"While I admire the Bush presidencies, I found this book boring. It is written as a catalog of events. There seemed not to be any central theme or purpose in the writing other than that it happened. That made it about as appealing as if a cook went into the kitchen and put every available ingredient into one pot to make soup."
5,WHAT A GREAT LADY,After reading the book by Laura Bush I decided to read the one written by Barbara and was soglad I did I never knew half the things I learned in her bioography an amazing women
4,Good tools,"This has some great reproducible surveys and tools to teach study skills to kids. It's a menu of ideas on what they need. While it can be a little detailed or wordy for some kids, I think useful for teachers getting started on what topics to cover and possible tools to use."
1,High school students do better,"Poorly written, historically wrong and woefully inadaquate reasearch. Save your money, stay away."
3,A Few Outstanding Photos...,"All photographers have a handful of great photos and Tom Murphy's great photos are dynamic and worth the price of this book. Many of the photos in this book are just average. However, I admire him for trekking through and camping in Yellowstone in the Winter. To even get average photos in this setting is commendable."
3,Silence and Solitude,"Very nice photos. Exposition moderately good for this sort of book. Too much ""I shot this when....."" Makes a nice complement to more serious works, but certainly not part of the core literature."
2,Photo Only No Detail Guide,"If you see the photos inside this book, You will not want trip to Yellow Stone in winter. from my point of he view, all the photos inside the book are score at 2/5."
5,Silence & Solitude: Yellowstone's Winter Wilderness,Book was in great shape and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a gift for my husband who is an avid outdoorsman and amateur photographer. The technical info Tom provided gave him additional insight into capturing nature shots effectively and dramatically. He has thoroughly enjoyed page after page of these images.
2,Not what I was expecting...,"Yes, the music is from the movie Cool Hand Luke. But, no, it is not the sound track from Cool Hand Luke. This is the ""elevator music"" version of the sound track. You'll find no lyrics here -- and the lyrics were what I was after."
3,You get what you pay for,Negatives -Darts are small.- Basic 1 beep sound for every button / shot in the game- Have to turn off the board in order to restart / change game- Darts have the tendency to fall off the board ( dont stick )- No extra darts ( comes with 6 )Positives -+ Only $35+ Nothing as broke yet+ Come with 10+ Extra tips
2,Not VeggieTales as you know it,"This one was a big disappointment. The animation is great, but there is no humor. There is no Bob and Larry, no silly songs and generally it is a very dark and serious story. The characters are not very likable at all which is a big change from previous films. The main characters don't look like veggies but some kind of green stick figures with hair. Not good. Too dark and depressing for the very young, mine didn't like it at all and they are always requesting VeggieTales."
3,dvd,"The DVD was great quality. However, though the message is great just like all other veggie movies, this one didn't have the opening counter top scene or the ending counter top scene w/ Bible verse. That is why I did not review it as high as the others I have purchased."
1,Worst VeggieTales video ever,"This is the worst VeggieTales video ever. It has very few, if any, funny jokes or silly songs. And Bob and Larry aren't even in it. Well, Larry is for a bit, but all he does is write what happens in the King's day, like a chronicler. Bob isn't here at all. There are a few songs, but they are definitely not what you'd expect from Big Idea. There are basically only four characters, Mr. Nezzer (King Xerxes), Esther, Mr. Lunt (the king's right-hand man), and Pa Grape (Esther's cousin Mordecai). There's also Jean Claude and Phillipe, the French peas, but they aren't even important to the story. There isn't even the famous VeggieTales theme song, the story just starts. Big Idea hit a low peak with this video, definitely rock-bottom, so far."
2,Disappointing,"I am usually a big fan of the Veggie Tales series. I highly recommend them to other parents. However, this video seemed to be moving away from what made them great in the first place.The usual Bob the Tomato and Larry the Cucumber antics are not there. The cheery, catchy songs that we all know and love are not there. The plot seemed a bit too thick and dark for children. There are alot of other VeggieTale tapes I would strongly recommend over this one."
3,"A wonderful story, but just not VeggieTales","I have to say, I was a little disappointed. Although the story was wonderful, and the animation unbelievably realistic, I feel it lacked the core of what drew me to Veggie Tales. Not only was Ester pretty whiny, but also I felt the Biblical message just wasn't there. Even though it is a Bible story, it seemed to be mostly about Ester finding strength in HERSELF, instead of in God, to do the right thing. I tried to show this to my preschool Sunday school class, and without the Silly Song intermission (when they usually get to get up and dance off some energy), they were bored 2/3 of the way through. It's a great movie for older kids, but just doesn't hold the attention of preschoolers, who don't understand the gangster theme anyway"
2,Not impressed,"We were all very dissapointed by this veggie tale. It just did not keep the attention of our toddlers, like the other ones do, there is no silly songs with Larry, and no begining theme song. We waited a long time for the release and was very dissapointed. Try some of the other Veggie Tales videos."
1,NOT your typical Veggie Tales story,"I was very disappointed with this one - as well as my wife. There was virtually no humor. And where was Bob & Larry? Bob wasn't in the movie at all, and Larry only a very minor role as the king's scribe - he barely even says anything. There was only one ""silly song"" which wasn't even catchy (unlike The Bunny Song and Song of the Cebu and my very favorite, Larry Boy Theme Song). Where were the recurring characters like Laura Carrot and Junior Asparagus? All I can say good about this one was the animation was excellent, but besides that, this didn't feel like a standard Veggie Tales... and by all means, avoid Big Idea's new series, 3-2-1 Penguins. What happened Big Idea? I know I saw Phil Vischer's name in the credits..."
5,True to the Real Story... and a blast to watch,"We bought this for our two year old son, since he loves Veggie Tales. This one though, has become his favorite. And it has become a favorite in the house, as my husband, my son and I recite lines daily from the video. Big Idea kept the story of Esther very true to the Bible story, yet made the less than desirable parts of the real story less ""crude"". For example, instead of banishing Queen Vashti from Persia for not parading in front of King Xerxes noblemen naked wearing only a crown, Veggie Tales has her banished for not making her husband a sandwich in the middle of the night. The gallows in the real story become ""Death"" with a feather coming to banish people to the ""Island of Perpetual Tickling"" in this Veggie Tales parody. Very well done, definitely Big Idea's best try at animation. And even if the story doesn't have all the original characters and silliness, it is a story worth hearing, and is very entertaining."
5,"Walking, Talking Vegetables","This unusual video concept with fantastic graphics, toe-tapping music and endearing characters does a good job of bringing bible stories to the younger set. Animation is sophisticated and colorful. ""Walking, talking vegetables...what's not to like?"" Charmed by the whole package. ""I liked how the movie looked. The computer animation was cool."" ""Neat songs."" ""It showed that you have to stand up for yourself."" ""Esther is really pretty."" ""I would like to learn more about what Esther did."" Ages 5-8."
1,Sucky...don't waste your $ on these.,"I thought these would be a good deal since they aren't as ugly and just as safe. Wrong. When they came, they were scratched from only the packaging. I thought I could deal with it, but when I started doing dental work they wouldn't stop fogging. Then on the way home I dropped them about a foot and they got scratched in 5 other places! They may look stylish and sleek, but don't waste your time or money on this product."
2,Henckels Fails to live up to Standard,"After receiving this set I was surprised to see that half of the set (the 8 steak knives) were so poorly made they probably wouldn't cut bread, let alone a steak or tomato! The solid stainless steel, serrated-edged knives are made in Korea, do not have matching wood handles or high carbon steel blades like the rest of the traditional Henckels knives in this set. I sent an email to the company and received no response either. They definitely need to improve the quality control on this Korean supplier."
2,Disappointed!,"Well, I bought this set without researching the difference between international set and real set from Germany.The kifves were rather dull, and its cheap price indicated its quality. I regret to jump up and bought the set at the department store.I am aware of how expensive the products from Germany, although it would be worth collecting the knives from REAL henckels!"
3,Game Manual not Secret Strategies,"This is the manual that should have shipped with the game. It contains comprehensive information about the game and how to play but does not give away true secrets. If you are interested in knowing exactly what the percent chance to hit is given a certain criteria than this book is for you. If you want to know what all the 1st level spells are than there are many online resources that would server you much better.I would still purchase my copy of the book again, I found the monster list of weaknesses indispensable. It is just that I was hoping for real secrets and strategies."
4,Nice Addition to Have,"Definitely a nice addition for general strategy and such. My major concern is that the book is not totally accurate. There is no way the book can be accurate. Turbine can change the game on the fly and just did. Vorous Shreths and Shore Armadillo's are no longer what they were before the change. Likewise, some dungeons and locations have changed. Get the book for a solid description of general strategy and reference, but remember things have an will change."
1,What a waste of money,"I bought this book when AC first went gold. I had been playing beta since early beta 0. Most of the information i was looking for is incorrect in the book because it is based on the world as it was in Beta 0. Lifestone locations were dramatically altered due to the issues resulting from population masses, they are no long located in the center of town (where the book places them). Town portal locations are mostly backwards (the destination is really the origin) and some are just bad. Dungeon locations are also not so great...download ACExplorer, it's free and it's more useful that this book."
2,"""strategies and secrets"" is false advertising.","This book spends a lot of time teaching you the same things you would learn if you spent 5 minutes playing the game. There is a couple sections that are a nice reference, but even they are outdated. There are very few maps, and the ones that are in there are outdated. Although there is a section that explains majic and is a good reference for spell components, There is NO SPELL GUIDE, which is one of the reasons why I bought the book. Sure, I could get it online, but I wanted it in hardcopy. I was just a little upset because the word ""secrets"" DOES NOT IN ANY WAY APPLY TO THIS BOOK, AND USING THE WORD ""STRATEGIES"" TO DESCRIBE THE BOOK IS REALLY STRETCHING IT. The author seams to want to write an expanded instruction guide. It seams as if he didn't want the book to be a spoiler, even though it was plainly advertised as one."
3,"A good information source, but a little outdated","This book was a great source of information for me when I first started playing. It covers a lot of the basic information about the game, and helps you get off to a good start with your first character. However, the game has changed a lot since the book was published, as Microsoft introduces large updates into the game every month. A second edition of this book would be great."
3,Asheron's call - what should have been in the box,"The book itself is ok, doesn't contain alot of ""hints"" persay as it's name would lead you to believe, but it does include alot of the basic ""how to play"" and stat/level experience tables, monster rundowns, etc..in my opinion it whould have been in the box with Asheron's call, it's far more a manual than a hint book..."
3,I was in Asherson's Call beta,"Being in the beta alot of this info was not usefull, but for a newbiw it can. Their are better online sites with more and betterupdated information.theprisoner"
2,Asherons Call Strategies,"This book is a waste of money. You can find much better info on the internet and the book is strewn with inconsistencies, errors and incorrect information! A real dissapointment considering its Microsoft's Game and als o ""THEIR"" book!"
5,YUMMY!,We used to get these in Canada until one day the border crossing cops confiscated them....to eat for themselves.... apparently even alcohol in candy is illegal to transport...who knew! Now we are so happy to be able to order them in ....it's well worth the wait! This is a favorite at Christmas time!
2,Don't purchase this movie,This movie is very quirky but have to agree w/ other reviewers on the content of the movie. This is a movie about a serial child molester and not the tender love story the case and some reviews I have read made it out to be. This is not gay cinema and plays more like a NAMBLA fantasy.
2,kind of slow moving... found it a bit creepy,Just a very slow moving film..... thought it would be better than it was.
2,What are you all thinking?,"I tell you what, this was not what I was expecting and at 22$+ I am less than satisfied. Who wrote the reviews, the film makers? While the story line wasn't a complete loss, the acting and method in which the film was brought to life needed some serious help. I don't know what I expected, but I know it was more than I got. Rent it, save yourself the headache, I have a copy for sale."
1,Save your money and buy something else!!,"Cinematography: This movie looks like it was shot on a home video camera. Acting: I've seen better acting in a 1st grade play. Story: With more work and effort the concept may have worked but as it stands, poor at best. I pruchased this video because I made the mistake of only reading 1 review... which happens to have been the only person who liked this movie. I disliked this movie so much that I actually logged on after watching about 3/4 of the movie to write this review. Save your money for something else."
2,I almost bought it...almost,"I almost bought the plot, but I couldn't help noticing how ugly Eban was. He screams creepy with his trashy unshaven face and tingle in his voice. Charley was certainly cute, but he was also 15. This is a very hard movie to produce in America with all the laws and stuff, and really just needs a better Eban. Not really worth it."
1,Disturbing,"""Eban and Charley"" tries to deal with a problem of paedophilia. The result is rather creepy.While watching it, I kept feeling uncomfortable. There were moments where I could clearly see that the people behind the project were trying to justify this deviation.As some reviewers noticed, the choice of main character - the pervert - was a mistake. It's hard to believe that anybody could be attracted to this man (I know, it's not his fault, but...). Moreover, his acting is odd.There are holes in the scenario and they make the whole story less probable to happen.The only positive aspect of this film is the young actor who portrays Charley. As far as I am concerned he is the best of all crew."
1,Where is the main song? DUH!!!!,Okay so where did the main song go???? do not buy the soundtrack people just a waste of money the song that Eban singed to Charley isn't included in the soundtrack.
1,Paperback scan is of little value,"I purchased this USGS publication thinking it was going to be a reprint or reproduction. It is a poor quality black and white scan. This makes the color figures in the original publication undecipherable and worthless. Also, the color plates included in the back pocket of the original publication were not scanned, further lowering the value of this product. Other publishers make this publication available as a CD in color for less money. Shop around!"
5,Gravel more than meets the eye.,"I am a rock musician/amateur geologist and I have read Waldemar's opus 4 times from cover to cover. If you want to know all there is to know about tertiary gravels, do yourself a favor and buy a copy of this book. What you learn will shock you.- z5"
4,my favorite ultra lounge cd,"I have quite a few in this series of CD's, but this one is my favorite. It's slick, cool, mysterious, and sounds like there's danger lurking around every corner. You'll feel like you're being interrogated when you listen to Dragnet/Room 43 (Ray Anthoney). I can't complain about the lack of inclusion of more well known songs on this album, the way one of the other reviewers did, because I have a lot of this kind of music on different CD's. If you like this one, you should also pick up Hugo Montenegro's ""Come Spy With Me"" CD, it's one of my alltime favorite CD's and it's great. Also one of the reviewers wrote that the Count Basie version of ""From Russia With Love"" is dull. HUH? He should turn up his stereo and listen to the Count's orchestra swing. This tune is originally from the Basie Meets Bond CD which is also another good one to get."
4,TV and Movie detective themes in Lounge interpretations,"The Crime Scene/ Ultra Lounge: When it gets down to it, you either love this style or you hate it. If you love the style, the ""Ultra Lounge"" series are the CDs to get. This one will especially delight those who love the old detective themes and want them Lounge style."
5,SPY PARTY BACKGROUND MUSIC,"It is just perfect for my spy themed Halloween party; has classics Dragnet, Mission Impossible, etc etc. Just what I was looking for! Came quickly and so plenty of time before the party. Good choice!"
2,Don't spend 50 bucks on this.,"When I saw the cover of Murakumo in my local Electronics Boutique, I thought it was going to be a combination of Robotech and the Armored Core series for Playstation. However I was disappointed.After the second level I just stoped playing. Not to ruin it for someone interested in buying it still, but you just go on these dumb missions where you chase after a weak machine called an A.R.K. It's pretty cool to be flying over skyscrapers and underneath the city chasing these things at Fast and The Furious type speeds, but it starts to make me feel like I'm watching a dog chase a frisbee. If that makes any sense, I don't know. That's just the way I feel.Whoever made this game didn't put much thought into it, so as a consumer don't put much thought into investing your hard to earn cash on it. Just wait 6 months for the price to go down or, better yet, rent it to see if I'm lying."
3,Repetitive and Challenging,"Murakumo looks awesome, the A.R.Ks are beautiful, but the gameplay leaves something to be desired. In every mission you are chasing something, the thing may change, but all you do is chase it and destroy it....boring. The speed at which you move is dizzying, but sometimes that hurts more then helps (namely when your target does a 180 and it takes you five seconds to figure out where it went and another five to turn around) The assortment of weapons is good. Sometimes I think they made the target just a little to hard, namely when fighting the LX-30 in the city, what is with all the missie towers, I took 96.3% damage, geez. Movies are good, but not worth it really. I would suggest buying this only if you really love speed an doing the same thing over and over again. MechAssault or Battle Engine Aquila much better buy."
1,BORING,I bought this game and was bored of it after 20 minutes. I highly recomend not buying this game.
4,Great,"While I read plenty of philosophy before reading this book, I don't think I was ever properly introduced to philosophy until I read this book.Although I read the whole thing cover to cover, I think one of the best features of this book is that you can pick it up and turn to any page whenever you need to do some thinking.In my experience, this is the best introduction of philosophical thinking that I have read. I also agree with another reviewer who says this should be required reading for teenagers. The problems and paradoxes presented in this book definately inspire one to think ""freely"", outside the bounds of your usual patterns.Also, it's a lot of fun."
5,A Stunning Book ..,This book bounces continuously between my fourteenyear old's room and mine as we vie for the privilegeof reading it.It turned his brain from mush to that of a sharp edgedthinker and our discussions provide the glue for ourintellectual bonding.Read it.
5,One of my all-time favorites.,"I have a soft spot for this book. I bought it when I was fifteen and it's first few chapters pretty much changed the way I think forever. The rest of it is good too, though! Most of the little philosophical puzzles discussed in modern society are found here. This book is *great* for a younger audience, and I very highly recommend it to parents for their kids. No, I take that back - this should be required reading for teens - help make the world a bit smarter. ;)"
4,A lot of fun,"While not exactly the most serious philisophical work available, this book is entertaining and enlightening. A good choice for someone just being introduced to philosophy or for a more experienced reader looking to have some fun after a few works by Cont or the like."
2,good only for the most stereotypical issues,"If you feel you are in among the most stereotypical sets of sex and relationship issues, this book is OK but if you aren't it becomes very much like a pop-psychology book. It's based on the out-dated Masters & Johnson work; however, it is good for the clinical side of sex and is encouraging for helping separate medical from mental problems.Even went to her clinic but it seemed to be a factory that does not allow for out-of-the-normal issues to be brought up or understood. While she may be great at what she does, her assistants were not."
4,slight change in direction(growth of musical talent),this cd is the new step from mental vortex more consintrated on the deepth and growth od their musical development.-simply they started thrash and have grown into great muscial conductors in the master piece of metal.I must admit i hear a bit of Vio-Vod's space like jazziness in spots.not for the old school fans of thrash but definity for fans of growth in music/into something more diamic and intense yet heavy music.
3,interesting sampler,"As the AMG review states this is an interesting sampler of old blues & slide guitar. Listened to this disc a few times so far, and it has been growing on me. Interesting string and fretwork, a good way to get the exposure of such music from the original 78's. Do not fear the Various Artists or compilation stigma, this title is worth the listen if you are interested or intrigued about this genre."
5,Sweetener No Calories,"Natrataste (the same as Equal or Aspartame) gives my coffee and cereal the best sweet taste of any artificial sweetener at a great price.It is completely non-toxic because it consists of three amino acids linked together. (When amino acids are ""linked together"" in long chains, they become proteins. Proteins are what we are ""made of"".)"
4,Excellent for newborns,"I agree with the other reviewers who commented that directions would be helpful and should be included, but it doesn't take a degree in rocket science to figure out how to ""install"" the headrest. Once hooked in, it stays in place and I have never had to re-adjust it. You must put both headrests in to secure it for a newborn's head.The headrest is great ... it keeps my newborn son's head stationary & from rolling around in his infant seat. Our infant seat goes in the car and in a jogging stroller and I've had success with both."
4,glad we bought this,"We have the Graco Metrolite system and our sons little head would flop everywhere in the car seat. We purchased this headrest (and took out the graco one) and now his head stays in place while we travel. I'm very happy that we purchased this one and once he's a little bigger, we'll take it out and put the graco one back in."
5,1st tiem Mom,"This has been a great product for us. If people are using this product correctly they should have no problem and it works wonderfully. Our little one is smaller and so we use the smaller one in additon to the head rest that is in the carrier to help keep her head from moving around. We first tried blankets, but you always had to have an extra blanket around when doing anything. We use the larger one for the bouncanet and swing. If you do not have them striped in like the you are supposed to they will wiggle around and the head rest becomes useless, but you should have them stapped in whatever you are using."
1,Dont' waste your money,"I bought this for my son's baby car seat because I would find him with his head bobbed to the side when I checked on him. It looked very uncomfortable. Hoping that this would solve the problem I bought this item. I have to say that it is a waste of money. There are no instructions in the package, thankfully it's easy to figure out. I installed it both as a single and also as a double and neither variation supported my sons head properly. I would still find him with his head bobbed to the side and looking uncomfortable. If I had the packaging I would return it. I will try it as he gets a bit older and see if it works better. I ended up using a rolled up receiving blanket and that worked much better. Save your money. I would have given it zero stars but the lowest is one."
1,How does it work???,"I recently got this as a gift---does anyone know how it should be installed correctly? And for those of you who don't like it, what do you use in place of it for head support?"
2,Keep looking,"I got this because I kept going to take my newborn out of the car and finding her head at a 90 degree angle. Well, it didn't look safe/healthy, or comfortable. I got this headrest because it seemed geared toward newborns. Well, the only way it works is to have both headrests in there at the same time. I have to readjust the dang thing everytime I put my baby in the seat. And it didn't come with any instructions on how to install in the carseat. I don't even know if I have it in there correctly. I would keep looking."
2,"High quality, but it likely wont fit your table","Very high quality - however, the diameter of the umbrella post is about 1/2"" larger than a standard umbrella table hole....it will not fit. This is a stand alone umbrella only and you will need the stand to hold it up."
1,good vendor service but cheap product,"You get what you pay for, I would definitely not recommend this umbrella. The connection between the top and bottom poles are not snug causing the umbrella to wobble , the fabric in quite thin and the stitching shottty, also the wood is painted with a very unappealing stain which was sloppily allowed to drip and run on the brass fittings, however I found the service with Bargain Outfitters through Amazon to be excellent , I returned the item without hassle and received a full refund. I would purchase from them again."
1,Don't Even Bother With This One!,"For all those people out there that are required to purchase this book for a class in undergraduate level psychology, you had better get ready for a rough ride. This book is an extremely difficult one to read. It is very complex with deep concentrated reading necessary in order to comprehend half of what is being presented. The flow of the book is extremely poor, constatnly jumping around from one topic to another without any decent segues. The case studies presented are extremely outdated and do not help much in understanding the topics being discussed. They are not explained well enough to show the relevance of the case study, and they are not tied into the discussion and used effectively at all. This is a poorly constructed book that will frustrate more readers than it will help."
5,Beneath the Mask,This book is excellent. It is very well written and provides interesting and exciting information. I have really enjoyed learning how the theories that we work from today come from the theorists own life expereinces. It is fascinating. I highly reccommend this book for those who really want to understand what is behind a theory and know the person behind the theory.
4,An Argument for This Book,"My daughter (12) really enjoyed this book. She is just at that age where serious critical thinking is kicking in and she found it a pleasure to read, memorable and a good resource. We are still talking about it!"
3,Religious Agenda,"The lessons in the book are well laid out, but I don't understand why the cover doesn't reveal the strong Christian perspective that permeates throughout the book. Because of the overt religious teachings, it would be inappropriate to present several of the exercises within a public school setting, just as it would be had the author used a strong Muslim or Wicca slant...Having said that, I have also upgraded my original rating because I continue to use the book and find it to be an effective teaching tool with my 8-year-old boys. I really do otherwise like the kid-friendly stories and explanations, and the boys love the exercises.My last rant: Responsible authors respect religious boundaries; it really bothers me that the title is so secretive about the book's religious undertones. Honesty truly is the best policy."
2,Kind of Dopey,"I hate to be too critical, but the presentation in this book is kind of dopey.In all fairness, I was looking for something quite specific. Earlier reviews suggested that this book was an exact match. Earlier reviews lied.I'm not sure who could benefit from this book. Perhaps a 2nd or 3rd grade teacher could use some of the material.I don't recommend the book though. Sorry."
4,Good value for this necessity!,"This headrest does offer a great value for the money. A few of my gripes are (1) the slots to attach this to the car seat should snap open so you do not have to unassemble your car seat straps to install ths properly, and (2) perhaps another fabric option would come in handy, since the two thick layers of cotton intended for support create a LOT of uncomfortable warmth for a summer newborn.This is still a must have for those first few months to help support the little one's head. Great value and available in a variety of colors!"
2,Never Used it in the Car,"It never seemed to fit right. What I did use it for though, was in the bassinet, it kept my son from feeling so lost in the bassinet and more snuggled and secure... In the car seat, it was pretty much a waste"
4,Wonderful for Fussy Babies,This product worked for me and my extremely fussy 2 month old baby who rather be all bent over than have a headrest. The infant seat that they gave me for my son did not com with a headrest. I had bought to others form different makers and he hated it. I even tried the rolled up blanket and he would move his head and arms until he was able to drop them. In my case I used the larger headrest for the car seat. He is still able to move his head which is what he likes with out letting him bend over into a ball.If you have a fussy baby and you have tried everything try this and see if it works for you.
3,"A biased, negative book","The title of this book is based on a false urban legend: Orthodox Jews DO NOT have sex through a hole in a sheet. The use of such blatant sensationalism is about par for the accuracy of this book. This a book by a secular woman with an anti-Orthodox agenda. It is currently being recommended on neo-Nazi websites as ""the truth"" about Orthodox Jews. Whether or not she intended to do so, the author has produced a tool for antisemites that gives a very skewed view of what she thinks Orthodox Judaism is.[...]"
1,It's not true,The simple problem with this book is that it is a total lie. There is no such thing as a hole in the sheet in Judaism. Observant Jewish do not have sex seperated by a sheet. The rest of the book is also untrue. Trying to learn about Orthodox Judaism by reading this book is like learning about the Holocaust from a Holocaust denier.

He has no formal training as a psychologist. He self-published this book and lied about his other publications (there are none). Don't waste you money.

5,comfy socks,Purchased for mother who was receiving physical therapy for broken ankle. She needed short athletic socks and these worked perfectly. She also reported these socks were very comfortable.
5,Great polish for car shine,"I am new to having a nice car (Dodge Challenger RT), and I love this polish. I have only used the all-in-one so far, but the results are extremely noticeable. I used this on the hood of the car, and it just pops during the day with a mirror-like shine.Extremely recommended!"
4,"VERY Original and Creative, Reflecting the Age's Atomosphire","This is a very original and creative peice of work considering the point that the album was initially released. If you like the works of the Art of Noize, Einsturzende Neubauten, Propaganda, New Order, Joy Division, etc., you will probably find that this work is very original and full of creativity which inspires you a lot. However, if you do like only melodious ones, please skip this. This would probably be not for you."
4,Industrial,"This is my favourite Throbbing Gristle album. It has all of their trademarks: distorted violins, strange looped rythms, weird sounds everywhere, creepy vocals by Genesis P. Orridge, loops and loops of manipulated tape... and also one of the most beautiful (!) Throbbing Gristle tracks ever recorded: the fifth track, also known as Dreammachine. The sound of the record is very unique: it has an easily distinguishable atmosphere you can easily tell from similar noise. A great album. Recommended."
3,"Fascinating, but . . .","It's hard to go wrong with Lewis and Tolkien. To have been present at the Eagle and Child pub during one of their legendary drinking/reading sessions--it's hard to imagine a greater privilege. Duriez is able to capture, or at least suggest, just how special this friendship was. His research is impressive and his writing is lucid. The book only gets three stars, however, because Duriez has the annoying habit of supplementing what isn't known with supposition. Dialogue and entire scenes are invented in order to push the story forward. One wishes that the author had stuck to the facts, even if that would have resulted in a shorter or less 'exciting' book. The facts that we do have are incredible enough."
5,A must for any Tolkien or Lewis fan,An easy read while maintaing strict attention to detail. This book propelled me to but other books from the Inklings to share with my children.
3,A casual joint biography,"Rather than a study of their friendship, this volume - a great improvement on Duriez's ""Inklings Handbook"" - is a joint biography, popping back and forth between the two even in their most intertwined years. Duriez uses both primary and secondary sources fairly well, skillfully skating over weak spots (e.g. that little is known of the early years of the Inklings) and sticky points (especially the causes of the friendship fading). It's a soft-minded book with little original to say, and Duriez's greatest achievement may be in writing imaginary vignettes of the subjects' lives that are not wincingly terrible. This book is for casual fans of the two authors who warm to the thought of them being pals together."
2,cloying,"The book is over-long, and in many stretches is painful to wade through if, like myself, one is not an evangelical Christian. The author's sympathy w/ Lewis' view of Christianity came across to me as cloying, fawning. I read this primarily to gain an understanding of Tolkien's antipathy toward Lewis' Narnia books. This author merely paraphrased Tolkien's words, w/o further explication. It was my impression that this author simply did not understand Tolkien's objections/was mystified that anyone could come to Tolkien's conclusions. Others clearly appreciate this author's efforts; I got very little out of it, though I stuck it out to the end."
2,Okay if you like that slimey feel ... does not sink in,"I don't care for creams which sit on top and just slime. Also, I know this is a ""natural"" cream, but the yellow oil which rises to the surface is unpleasant to me. I tried to like this off and on for over a month. That said, a friend of mine really likes it. Too bad she is 3000 miles away, I send it to her. Instead, it's washed out and the plastic in the recycle bin."
5,LOVE this stuff!!,"I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin, so I was hesitant to try this, however this cream has exceeded my expectations!! When I opened the jar I could tell this cream was extremely high quality. It doesn't have the appearance or consistency of ""commercial"" creams and when you apply it, it absorbs into my skin so smoothly. It is the middle of a Minnesota winter and my face and hands feel very soft and moisturized. The calendula is soothing and the oils are blended for the smoothest application. It is more of a heavy overnight cream and I would be hesitant to put it on under my makeup during the day, but it is perfect for overnight. It seems too heavy to put around my eyes, but it works well on the rest of my face, neck, and hands. I'm sure it would work well on any area, though. This is a product I will order again and again!"
5,Incredible product,"It's heavy stuff and pretty greasy, which is why I use it at night after cleansing. I wake up in the morning, the product is completely absorbed, and my skin looks soft, rested, smooth, and so very flawless. Not to mention, I have incredbly fussy, senstivive skin that is very dry and tends to break out as well. This stuff moisturizes SO WELL and doesn't clog up any pores despite how thick it is. Calendula is not only used to sooth, but also to treat acne. It's pretty much like a super healing miracle lotion. I've used it on tattoos (new and old) and eczema. GET THIS and use for literally anything and everthing!!"
2,Lifestyle for Dummies,"Consider this: metrosexuality is really nothing new. Stated in the most simplistic manner, metrosexuality is no more than a polite man who understands how to dress and appreciates the finer things in life. In a nutshell, a metrosexual is what used to be known as a gentleman. The term gentleman may not be politically correct or interesting enough to sell books in a day when the new straight is gay. So to sell this lifestyle book, the author has capitalized on the latest social trend.In general this is a hip and fun book. I'd recommend it for the young man whose upbringing didn't include, for example, exposure to manners, tipping, wine selection, or dress. In general, this is a `how to' lifestyle guide for dummies. It isn't a serious guide to style. So, if you are serious there are far better style books or magazines to buy."
3,Nothing really new here...,"There's not much in here that you won't find in the various Esquire guides, or in the much better _The Modern Gentleman_. But still some good advice. I'd say if you want a *complete* library of men's style books, then pick this up. Otherwise, give it a pass."
2,"Men's basics, not more","This book is about basics, everybody should know. If you're interested in this book, you know what's in it and hopefully more. If not, you'll need much more than this book. Nevertheless it's funny to read, but not more."
1,"This book is great, assuming you grew up in a gutter.","I had parents who, shockingly enough, gave me most of this ""wisdom"" by the time I was 12.I am actually embarrased to have been given this book (by somebody who doesn't know me well) and have since tossed it in the garbage.I actually got angry reading it. Not only is it full of mistakes (tips are not ON TOP of tax) but is so poorly written, so obvious and so short that it's a ""book"" destined for the remainder bin.The only joy this book gave me was in being flung across the room into ye old trash bin."
1,Save your ducats guys.,"Hey guys, save your money. The cosmetics industry is not satisfied that women spend billions of dollars on stuff that tries to make them purdy, smell good, and end those wrinkles - they want guy's money too.Isn't it funny that the woman's cosmetic industry tries to sell anti-aging creams on TV using teen girls as models? No wonder your honey is so upset. She is 36 trying to look 16!Now its our turn guys. They are trying to sell us the idea we have to get our nails done and get our faces treated with creams and what not. Don't fall for it. Do you think John Wayne, Bogart, or Paul Newman would use anti-wrinkle cream on their faces?I don't think so!Save your money and buy this month's Maxim and a six pack. Believe me women don't want girlie men who have their nails done."
4,How to be a met,"This is like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, yet its more like Straight Eye for the Straight Guy. Like most straight men, I have no fashion or culture sense. This books gives me some ideas (yet I doubt I will buy myself three white and three black shirts). It even gives you an overview on wine, books, and art. Nice book to glance at everyonce in awhile."
5,an essential read,"This is a smartly written book, and thankfully it's also light reading. Required reading for any man who cares to be more refined than the next guy & establish himself as a cut above."
2,This item is a drip!,"As long as you fill the cup almost to the top and drink only about half the coffee, it functions fine. However, once below half full and you have to tilt it further back, it leaks, runs down the cup, and gets on your clothes. I use a towel to catch the drippings. I have one at work I love but this one leaves me feeling stained."
5,The best of a great series,"Rhapsodesia is the best volume yet of the UltraLounge series, From ""Go Slow"" to ""Sleep Walk,"" pure, dreamy, smooth. Play it at a barely audible volume sometime around 3:00 in the morning."
4,A little hard but.......,"This game is just about perfact it has some of PS2 greatest graphics.The controals are a little shakey at first but once you get canfortable with them you are good to go.The missions are super long and sometimes comfuseing,so if you get frustrated easily you should buy the strategy guied.Finally, you only get two weapons throughout te hole game."
2,"Gee whiz at first, but gets old FAST...","I was very excited about trying out what I had heard was one of the best games of the year. And popping into the PS2 for the first time, I was VERY impressed. The graphics are stunning, especially the lighting and night-vision. But once you start playing the game, it's completely linear. Every mission needs to be completed exactly the same way. Why bother playing it again?"
4,Metal Gear with even more stealth,"If you like the metal gear games then you'll love splinter cell. the game is completely based on stealth. to help you there are pipes, fences and zip lines to help you navigate through the darkness. shoot out lights and throw different objects throughout the game to distract your oponents while you sneak away or close in for the kill!"
4,"""Stealth""","I'm a big fan of stealth games. I love Tenchu, and though many dislike the Tenchu series for it's relative simplicity in plot, it has actual stealth play in it. You run around, scouting areas, and try to stay hidden, the scoring let's you know how good you are (or bad) at the sneaking thing. But with Splinter Cell it's an all or none thing. You are forced to sneak in a heavily scripted way. Everything is planned and your mission pretty much fails if you don't get something just right. Hence, the game is one giant series of trial and error experiments which involve more memorization than improvisation and stealth."
1,"""OMG Splinter Cell made XBOX""","Actually i thought it [was unacceptable], from camera agles to story. Control was good, buy hey playstation always controls good."
4,It's a good start,"I liked this game but the missions were just too hard. This is the beginning of the Splinter Cell series from gaming mastermind, Tom Clancy. This game dominated the ps2 world for quite some time now and the second series, Pandora Tommorow is even more better. But eventually this game will get boring. So if you liked Metal Gear Solid, this is the more better version of it and has great realistic graphics and excellent stealth mode gameplay. It's great, one of the best games to come on the ps2, and there will be more games of the same kind to come."
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME,"i,ve finish this game at last but i,ve never play a game like this before it was very very hard but i like it very much i was play it at the day 10 hours some times just to finish it ,,, if u wanna buy this game u have to think because its not like u think because its defferent for all the games of this world and if u have pachent u can play this game u will like it very much but as i sead its very hard ,,, if u buy it & u cant finish it just ask me and i will help u.rami202@excite.com."
1,"Ultimate Codes:Splinter Cell-Intec,buyer beware!!!!!","If you have the new 'Sony PS2'-model number#SCPH-50001,you are not compatible to play 'Intec'(code cheats),Intec is selling a disc to 'unlock cheats',for the PS2,the catch is if you have a new Sony PS2-model number#SCPH-50001,your not compatible to use their disc's. Take a look on the back of your console,its simple,take a look,if the model number is #SCPH-50001,your not compatible to use their disc's period. Intec web site:(codejunkies.com)....."
2,hardley a worthwhile title,"pros: *decent enough grahics*decent handling*plenty of moves*some nice level designingcons: *weak AI*numb, inaccurate, piss weak weapons (all 2 of them)*very linear*very little snazzy equipment (what little you getyou never use)*annoying alarms programmed to go off without warning(supposedly when a body has been found when it blatantlyhasn't cause there is no one to there find it)*short game*a good 1/2 is made up of crappy missionsthe cons outweigh the pros, now i'm off to part exchange mine."
2,Annoying!,"If you don't do a task EXACTLY as the game wants you to, you are stopped and must start over again. No room for even small errors or exploring the game. This game takes patience and time, of which I have but not to the degree expected. Didn't finish the game. Prefer Hitman 2: Silent Assasin, 007, and Tomb Raider series."
2,Don`t buy it as a replace for Metal Gear!,"The only reason I bought this game was someone told me it was better than MGS. Men he was wrong! This game its not bad, but it doesnt get any better than MGS. The story line doesnt have any real peacks as it does in MGS. I didn`t like it."
5,"Perfect, in theory","I bought this game when it first came out for ps2. total mistake. it soon went down to $40, then an audacious $20. It's not that the game is bad, it's just too slow and frustrating. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are awesome, the lighting realistic, and storyline interesting. But it's just not fun enough. I have a new theory, I just thought it up. These are called video GAMES. a game should be fun, and try to be real, but the fun comes first. It's amazingly realistic(except when your arm goes through a wall... ) but it's almost too realistic. it's not really focused on fun. it got so realistic that it's not a game anymore, it's just a reflection of the NSA(well, do we REALLY know that?) That's why i gave it just 2 stars for fun, but five for overall. I hope this review was helpful."
1,hated it,its the best game ever GIVE ME A BREAK! PLEASE ITS THE WORST SPY GAME EVER BOTTOMLINE IS DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY
1,Worst game ever!!!!!!,This has got to be the worst game I have ever played. 1st the graphics are horrible 2nd the missions are relly hard I got stuck on this mission were I am on the boat and there is nowhere to go. You will find yourself doing one mission over and over again till you finally want to take an ax to your ps2.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game.
4,Frustrating yet so fun,"I know this is blasphemy, but when I compare Splinter Cell to MSG2, I would have to take Splinter Cell. The lighting effects are awesome. Furthermore, I really enjoy not having to rely on a radar which just isn't realistic. Most importantly, I haven't spent half of the game watching a movie. I will take gameplay over story any day. Besides, the MSG2 story didn't make any sense.Some people complain about the combat system. Splinter Cell isn't about combat. It is about the super cool ways to get around the guards.It is quite a hard game. You will spend most of the first level trying to get the moves down. However, once I figured it out, I couldn't wait to hit the next situation. I guess the difficulty is the only reason for giving it four stars. There are times when I don't want to replay an entire section because I [fouled] up once...."
3,GOOD GRAPHICS BUT I EXPECTED MORE FROM IT,"WHEN I BOUGHT THIS GAME, I EXPECTED IT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IVE EVER PLAYED. THE GAME OVERALL IS COOL, BUT ITS ONLY GOOD FOR A WEEKEND CUZ THE GAME GETS REALLY BORING AFTER A WHILE. ALSO THEIRS ONLY LIKE THREE WEAPONS.HERE ARE THE PROS+ GOOD GRAPHICS+ FUNNY DIALOGUE+ STEALTH GAMEPLAY+ SHADOWS ARE GOODCONS- I EXPECTED ALOT OF THIS GAME- NOT ENOUGH WEAPONS- NO REPLAY VALUE- SOME OF THE SHADOWS ARE UNREALISTIC- YOU DO THE SAME THING IN ALL THE MISSIONS"
3,A game for people who like the genre !,"If you liked Metal Gear Solid then you will love this game. However if Unreal is more your thing then you may find the pace of Splinter Cell a little slow and the fustration level high. The game could also have been a bit longer, but I am sure there will be a few expansion packs on the way. There is a medium to high level of re-playability."
4,"Good, Good, I like your style, Mr.Fisher...","This game will kick ... when it comes out. I've played the PC version, and thats a lot of fun, and I've also played the XBOX version, and, yet again, that was a lot of fun. If you own a PS2, the only thing better than this game in the sneaking category is Metal Gear Solid 2. In my opinion, Konami and UBI Soft should come together to make a game that is part Metal Gear Solid, and part Splinter Cell. I'm gonna buy this the day it comes out, and I advise you to do the same."
2,splinter cell...........,I hate it.i just hate it.people say its good and that made me go and buy it immediately...rent it before u rent it.i am sure u will be dissapointed.go to get metal gear solid instead of this.....
4,"Not very fun, but cool on story mode!","Well, Tom Clancy first made the books, now video games? Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. Halo Combat Evolved & Rainbow six were a knock-out at the time. This game was cool on spying... really good on spying"
3,I hate tom clancy games and this is no exception,"This is your average stealth game. Not enough action and to much not knowing what to do or where to go. The levels are OK. Everyone thinks the graphics are good, but they really aren't as good as they think. Not very fun at all. There aren't any good tom clancy game and this continues the streak."
3,"its cool, and fun...but its one of the trial and error games","Trial and error: try something, screw it up, try it again till u get it right....this is in short the gameplay...it comes with the genre"
1,Splinterless Cell,"NOT FOR EVERYONE. I found it very boring, tedious, and unmotivated. Graphics are good, but the game is not fun. I found myself forcing me to play it just because I payed to rent it. TRY BEFORE YOU BUY!! Get Matrix/Kingdom Hearts/NBA Street Vol. 2/or Something else instead."
3,could have been better,"Splinter Cell just doesn't live up to the hype i've heard about it. It is a good game as far as graphics and storyline go but the game could have been so much more. The ""T"" rating took a lot of the game's potential away in my opionion. I would advise a rental on Splinter Cell before you rush out to buy it. I borrowed my brother's copy for a day and have reconsidered plans to buy it flat out. It only gets 3 stars because it could have been much better. It can't compete with MGS2 on many levels."
1,NOT what is advertised,Another purchaser that wanted a male to female extension cable and received a male to male which DOESN'T work for me!!! I wish these folks would update the description for this item to reflect what you will actually receive. Don't purchase unless you are looking for a male to male cable!
2,"Good, but wrong","It was billed as M/F which is what I was looking for. Other reviews said they had ordered M/M and received M/F incorrectly. Since M/F was what I wanted, I ordered it and just assumed the others had read the description wrong. However, I got M/M. ??? Length is correct, signal strength is good, but what connections you get will apparently be a crap shoot. I was in a bit of a hurry so I ended up ordering a gender changer for $3 b/c that seemed easier/faster/cheaper than returning it."
4,Caroline was hilarious as hell!,"Rhea was hilarious in One Night Stand. This is simply NOT the Caroline Rhea you remember from Sabrina the Teenage Witch. When she says the f-word at the beginning of the show, you know you are going to be in for a wild ride. Caroline was best with her Sound of Music comedy routine. What Rhea says was shocking! I never would have thought something as cute and family friendly as The Sound of Music could be turned into a filthy R-rated joke in Rhea's hands but Rhea does it with pizazz.Only drawback is I wish the stand-up would be much longer than a mere 30 minutes but Rhea delivers the comedy goods in One Night Stand."
3,Adequate but not definitive.,"While the music on this disc is certainly great, there's really no reason why even the most casual Sly fan should buy it. For the same price, you can get the Anthology CD, which contains everything Greatest Hits does, but in chronological order AND with eight additional tracks besides. For that reason, I'd say anyone looking for a comprehensive introduction to, or overview of, Sly's music should seek out the Anthology rather than this.One other problem, not only with this CD but also with the Anthology and all of the original album CDs, is that the discs were issued in the early- to mid-1980s and suffer from poor sound quality, bare-bones packaging, etc. Epic really needs to overhaul this band's catalog, and give us a full-blown box set as well; supposedly those things are going to happen in the next year or so. Stay tuned."
3,A Half-Hearted Affair,"""The Greatest Hits"" album as an institution is not one that I like. Invaraibly the dastardly record company leaves us hanging by excluding one or two pivotal tracks. Sly's case is no exception with the glaring omission being ""Family Affair"" off Sly's gritty ""There's a Riot Goin On"" album. That said there's a lot of good time booty-shaking funk that screams CRANK ME TO 11! This mix is peppered with two or three iffy songs that seem incongruent with the BOMBS that Sly and the Family are dropping. My all-time Sly favorites are ""If You want Me To Stay"" and ""Skin I'm In,"" both off the FRESH album which I would tell even a part-time Sly fan to purchase over Greatest Hits. Why? Fresh is a more powerfull and cohesive work with excellent though ""smaller"" songs. Just ignore Que Sera Sera. Peace"
5,One of the best albums ever!,"This has always been one of my all-time favorite albums. In high school I bought it in album form and played the grooves off so often I'd replaced it at least 4 or 5 times. Later I had it on 8-track tape, cassette and now on CD. Never get tired of listening to Sly's Greatest Hits and it remains my favorite even after all these years."
5,Can Black Mothers Raise Our Sons?,This is a very informative and helpful book. I have learned a lot and seriously recommend that everyone read it!
1,ANOTHER LOSER,"THE FIRST PROBLEM I HAD WAS THE TITLE ALONE. CAN BLACK MOTHERS RAISE OUR SONS, IS THERE ANOTHER RACE OF WOMEN WHO CAN DO BETTER: PRODUCE MORE TIGER WOODS AND ALICIA KEYS. AND IT ALSO IGNORES BLACK DAUGHTERS TO BE LEFT TO BE PREYED ON BY PREDATORS LIKE R-KELLY. HE COULDVE EASILY NAMED THE BOOK ""HOW TO RAISE BLACK SONS"" FOR THE SIMPLE FACT SO MANY WOMEN OF OTHER RACES HAVE CHILDREN BY BLACK MEN. THE SAD PART IS 70% OF BLACK WOMEN ARE SINGLE MOTHERS RAISING CHILDREN ALL BY THEIRSEVLES, WHY WONT THE AUTHOR ASK ""WHY WONT BLACK MEN HELP BLACK WOMEN RAISE THEIR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD"". IN NEARLY 50 YEARS ALL RETIREMENT HOMES FOR THE ELDERLY WILL BE FILLED WITH BITTER BLACK MEN WHO ABANDONED THEIR CHILDREN AND ON THEIR DEATH BEDS WILL BE THE ONLY TIME IN THEIR LIVES THEY'LL REALIZE EVERY MISTAKE THEY'VE DONE AND SEE EXACTLY HOW AND MILLIONS OF BLACK CHILDREN ARE FATHERLESS DUE TO FINGER POINTING AND BLAMING INSTEAD OF BEING REAL MEN AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY."
4,A highly enjoyable story about believable people,A contemporary set story of a young woman whose misplaced sense of loyalty leads her to make a disasterous marriage and stick to her vows long after most people would have given up on a husband who was a thief as well as a liar. Eventually she calls it a day and comes home to England and to her friends to re-build her life. This is not in any way a sad story. In fact Mr Right is waiting in the wings if the heroine would only notice - and there is a great deal of humour to be found in the author's descriptions of the everday follies of human beings. The characters are believable and well drawn - highly recommended.
4,A classic,"The First track, ""Long distance Call"" is a classic. The others are kind of weaker repeats , but the whole thing rocks."
3,A Mess of the Blues,"This album is a follow up to the previously released albumSuper Blues. The first album had Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley and Little Walter. This album substitutes Howlin' Wolf for Little Walter. The album features a jam session featuring the three stars, with legendary bluesmen Otis Spann, Hubert Sumlin, Buddy Guy and Clifton James lending support. They run through some of their best known songs. The performances are long and sloppy, but kind of fun. These songs aren't nearly as good as the original versions, but it's fun hearing these legends work together (and make fun of each other). This is by no means an essential blues album, but fans of these guys may want to get it anyway."
2,It sucks,"I bought this set half a month ago from bestbuy to be the backup of my AT&T phone. It's light, and its button is smooth-touched. However, just a few days ago it started sounding noisy no matter how near the handset is to the base.I won't recommend it even at this low price,if you don't want your call to interrupted by the sudden noise."
5,great little table,"Had a couple of these tables in my cookie shop already. When I found I needed more, I searched on Amazon and get them for about 30% less then I'd paid originally elsewhere. Easy to assemble and sturdy. I've had my original tables for over 2 years now with daily use in my shop and they're still going strong."
5,"Yay, It's here!","Very excited to have received my Panty & Stocking DVD set so quickly after release! The box was in perfect condition and nothing got crunched or damaged. Thank you! As for the DVD itself, its great to be able to watch this anime in English Dubs!"
3,everything but the heaven coin,"when i found this one here and rightstuff i decided to buy it from amazon because im use to the good service i have gotten in the past while shopping here, even if it did cost a little more. and was looking forward to getting this and of course the LE item the Heaven coin. and when i opened it up i was looking in the packaging and then opened both dvd cases and did not find the heaven coin. not finding that but knowing others got the coin made me upset knowing i could have went for the cheaper site and gotten it. while Amazon does a great job making sure the stuff you order is safe i wish they would have had the heaven coins with the box set they sold"
1,Lame. Can't Understand the Hype.,"Bottom line, it's not funny. I don't mind offensive content in the least (many of my favorite series are extremely offensive). But this series seems to hold to the idea that offensiveness itself is somehow hilarious. Maybe that works if you're in Junior High, but for the rest of us, you need to actually add humor to it, _then_ it's hilarious. Didn't laugh once.And to add insult to injury, the animation is just ridiculously bad. I don't mean the ultra-simplistic art style - that I don't mind (and kind of like). I mean they do as little animating of the artwork as humanly possible (lazy), so it winds up looking like some paper puppet show an eight-year-old could do.Obviously, you could say the same of Shin-chan; but the difference is, they made Shin-chan funny enough to compensate. That just isn't the case here. It felt like listening to someone tell jokes at a party, and the guy telling the jokes obviously thinks he's hilarious as s***... but no one else is laughing."
1,Not all that it's cracked up to be.,"For all the hype surrounding this title, I found this anime to be a major disappointment. The next Shin-chan it's not. I liked Shin-chan with it's humor covering Eastern and Western topics as well as his butt and elephant dances. Panty and Stocking, on the other hand, had no humor at all. I didn't laugh once through the entire series. The episodes are largely monster-of-the-day scenarios with the ""ghosts"" embodying every conceivable bodily excretion. The dialog was 90% cursing. Now if you think that swearing is funny, then this series was F-ing hilarious. Otherwise you'll be S-O-L. The artwork is largely what you see on the box, blocky, deformed characters with no MOE-ness at all. The fan service, if you can call it that, isn't even worth the effort. Even if there had been brief nudity, the artistic style would have killed it."
1,"Sub: Great, Dub: Does not exist","No seriously. I just pretend the dub never happened. The sub is great and the show is really funny, but the dubbed version is just TERRIBLE. Really terrible. The voice actors are horrid, the cursing is stiff and awkward, and the translation is just terrible.Lines like ""I'm the reason preteens make themselves barf"" are NOT funny. Come on, Funimation, you can do better than this."
1,it's not even a little funny,"The DVD's are fine, the content is not.If you watch with subtitles and original Japanese soundtrack then it's not as bad, but the English dialog is even more vulgar and profane. When the main characters excrete profanities in English while the rest of the dialog is in Japanese -- it feels like they are just showing off, being cool. When you hear and endless stream of English profanities -- they are not being cool, they are simply base.I have no idea who the intended audience for this show in US is supposed to be. The characters are completely unrelatable -- bratty, inconsiderate, shallow, selfish and rude Angels with a typical over-inflated sense of entitlement. I really hate this show and regret this purchase."
1,its okay....Not awesome,"It's about two fallen angels, Panty and Stocking, who got kicked out of heaven and are now trying to work their way back by defeating ghosts by using their namesake items, a pair of panties that transforms into a gun,and stocking socks that transform into swords, to combat them and to try to earn coins so they can return back, all in a episodic rate. Well that pretty much the gist of the plot. It's like one big dirty joke.The anime looks like it was made in a western style cartoon. The characters aren't really likeable. There's Panty the slut who uses her panties as a gun. And Stocking the goth who uses her stockings as swords. There's also an annoying dog named Chuck. I think he's just a ripoff of Gir from Invader Zim except much, MUCH more annoying. The only character that I do kinda like is Garterbelt. The story is pretty much always a monster appears and they kill it, im not to liking on the animation."
5,Over 20 years to find this group and.......,"....to hear the band's song India has one more time been an exciting experience. I reccomend this song vastly because of its great rhythm, instrumental variations, great musicians and great composition all together."
4,Good major label psych CD,"This was originally released on Capitol Records 1969, and has a nice major label production sound. Good songs too. Evidently it didn't sell very well and Capitol dropped them. They went on to record two short, less interesting LPs for a local label. This is the one to get."
1,Not Safe,"I took a baby safety course from a local police department before my son was born. I was cautioned about using these types of products because your babies head should be directly against the car seat. I was told to cut the backing out, which I did because I had already discarded the receipt. Save your self money, and use rolled up recieving blankets. Even after cutting the backs out, these did not work as well as rolled up recieving blankets."
3,It's just all right,"This is an ok product. I bought it to keep my sons head from bouncing around when we drive. But then I found the Snuzzler and I liked it much better. It cradles his entire body and that seems to support his head and neck much better. Plus, it adds a little warmth in the carseat during the winter."
4,Mixture of useful and less useful ideas,"I liked Sections A and B. They were useful. The other stuff is the (ego centric) authors own ideas taht most players wont have use for.Don't just evaluate your hand, think about what the other players will respond. Walk the Dog. Bluff. Pass. Psych. Bidding only, no play of the hand."
1,Where's my Shanghai Dynasty CD?,"I am listed as having ""purchased"" this game when in fact I only ordered it! Where is it? Don't be charging me until it is shipped, please!"
3,Slightly disappointed after a long wait,"This anthology is the first of its kind in breadth and subject matter, and is a welcome addition to classrooms and bookshelves. However, I am only giving it three stars because the editors chose to parcel out each of these women writers to individuals, ranging from top-notch translators, to graduate students. The result is a mish-mosh of translations, sometimes brilliant, sometimes lackluster, sometimes not even heeding the original form of the poem. Worse still, it has been summarily edited--presumably for the sake of consistency--in such a fashion that there is a certain staleness to the sections. Nonetheless, it is as yet the only book of its kind in English, and therefore a necessary and important addition to the scholarship."
4,The Circle of Fire,"In this story the Circle of Fire everyone gets helped or gets a friend. The story is set in the country area of North Carolina after the Civil War. Harrison and his colored friends enjoy the fun stuff in life. Going on picnics, picking black walnuts, and waiting for Christmas to come. There is a man now as Mr. Bud Highsmith. He owns one side of wood road and the other side is in Harrison family area. They met a nice boy named Limp. Limp was a gypsy boy. They moved down there during Christmas. They usually come in the spring. They had a bad meeting with the KKK. Harrison and Limp are found with the KKK and a hard place. What will happen to them? If you like books that make you feel like that you are there. Read this book."
5,Works well and is tasty for our dog,"My pug had to have surgery when her intestines became clogged from eating so much fabric and hair. After that scare, the doctor suggested we give our pug Lax'aire, which along with us removing our carpets would help prevent the problem from happening again. We have given it to her twice a week for four years since then without any problems, and she loves the flavor of it. Our vet recently gave up restocking Lax'aire, so I bought it this time from Entirely Pets here on Amazon. I found Entirely Pets to be a good company to buy it from because the product had a year long expiration date."
5,Great stuff!,"Not only is it great for hairballs, but it works as a reward after giving medicine or pills!"
1,lady in cement,this was a bomb at the box office for a good reason. The silly music drowns out silly scenes. Frank looks good but the story is awful he tries his best but there is no getting around a bad movie...
3,Lady In Cement (1968),"Waldo?!?!Now this is a movie with sharp dialogue, comic facial gestures (not over the top) and funny situations that does not fail to please.Sinatra proves in this minimalist's guide to script a film that it takes nothing less than a good actor with substance to pull it off and come around as a winner. Sinatra has that magic touch; he can own a scene and make it work. Dan Blocker has that same quality, plus his physique; he creates a persona that is a study case for character actors.Overall, a very entertaining film with many inside jokes. Notice that Sinatra at one point, when talking to Welch, says that he knew a girl that used to date bullfighters. Now if that was not a hint to Ava Gardner then the film The Barefoot Contessa just did not happen.Therefore, relax, enjoy the film and remember to....Stay loose.Again?!?!"
3,Frankie seems preoccupied,Bought this based on the quality of an earlier Tony Rome movie. Sad to say this one does not measure up. The acting and direction are not up to the standard of the earlier movie and Frankie also seems distracted. Even so this is a period piece and notable for the inclusion of Frank Sinatra.
3,"Once was almost, but not quite, enough!","Sequels are rarely as good as the original, as Frank Sinatra's second outing as Tony Rome in ""Lady in Cement"" proves. The screenplay here is notably inferior to the one in ""Tony Rome;"" the chemistry between Raquel Welch and Frank never really has a chance to get airborne, let alone scale the heights achieved between Jill St. John and Sinatra in the first flick. Then, too, the times have changed. 'Ole blue eyes has ""lost"" his trademark pork pie hat, but by now ""The Graduate"" has come out and been seen by many, and the ""world's greatest generation"" has lost its credibility and appeal. Suddenly, a Frank Sinatra showing up dressed in a coat and tie and drinking martinis seems very ""out of it,"" and, YES, I was a witness! But oftentimes you don't realize what you've missed until its gone. No, ""Lady in Cement"" is not ""Tony Rome,"" but I wouldn't miss it now for the world."
2,Poor Introductory Text,The text lacks substance with examples and inadequately prepares for the end-of-text questions. The book either assume a higher background level or simply lacks adequate explanation in the text. If you are forced to use this text as an introductory couse - purchase Griffiths Quantum Mechanics (1st or 2nd addition) as a supplement text - you will need it!!!
2,Poor quality book,The prints on the book was not clear and the book binding seemed that it could fall apart anytime. I wouldn't buy this if I had seen it.
3,Not Hautala's best by a long shot...,"This is your average horror novel that has a decent premise but you just get bogged by the slow-developing plot. However, Hautala is a solid writer who may have been experiencing a tight deadline or ""writers block.""However, I am sympathetic because anyone who has tried writing a novel knows how difficult it is. The story is still worth reading; pick it up in a used book store, garage sale. You could even buy it used here on Borders.com, but I wouldn't pay full price.The story revolves around Sarah, who witnessed a crime. The attacker comes after her and she and her protector fight him off. Moves slowly, some of the characters aren't fully developed, but still a decent read."
1,Strictly for horror fans who don't know any better.,"I've read several books by Rick Hautala, all of them from ""Moondeath"" up through the ""Intensity"" ripoff, ""Impulse,"" and every time I finish one of them I put it aside and ask myself why I have wasted my time reading a book by a man who writes as well as Richard Nixon sings. This is another suspenseless piece of fodder that features excruciatingly annoying characters (a Hautala staple). This one was so bad it ended my string of reading his books, so for that I must be grateful. My fave scene is the one where the girl is trying to escape from the bed where her captor is sleeping and she stops in the middle to have an out-loud conversation with her ""protector."" Hautala should return to remedial writing class...where...he'd learn...that ellipses...and exclamation points...shouldn't be used in...every...sentence!"
4,Adorable,I was hesitant to order because the cost was over $20 but it was simply adorable! It was hard to find a small (under 12mths) witch costume and this one was worth the money!
5,Cuttest witch ever,My 2 year old daughter picked this witch costume out online by herself and I was skeptical at best. When the costume arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It turned out to be a really cute costume and we received so many complements. It held up great and I hope to pass it along so someone else can enjoy it next year. Great for the price!
5,quality stealth game,"This game is like no other....it isnt like bond or GTA3 or anything like that. the shadow is your weapon. it really gives you a new perspective from all of the other shooters...in a sense its not really a shooter, its more covert ops recon. If you want a game that just goes in and blows everyones brains out then this isnt the game you want. If u want a new perspective to action gaming then get this game. It's well worth your time"
5,yippy!,"First, let me tell you that i am a big rainbow six fan. also, i played metal gear solid (the newest one) and it was one of the funnest games. i know their stories are completely seperate, but the gameplay is a lot of the same. sneaking around and just doing cleaver things to complete the mission. i was going to get this for my pc, but i will have to choose now. throwing in great graphics in these games make them that much enjoyable. everybody knows that now a days graphics can make or break a game (like need for speed 2 for gc, horrible), anyways this game is going to look great. the x box version looks great and i'm sure this version will too. can't hardly wait."
4,master piece,"This is the kind of game you dream about!! sneaking into the most heavily gaurded places in the world, completly fool hundreds of guys, this game is amazing. Theres no more just walking around amlisly firing machine guns. Instead of opening doors you can hide your camera under it to see if anyones in there. Instead of just blowing some guy away and get shot in the process, you can grab onto the ceiling then drop down and put him in a choke hold. You can really put your guy in the exact posision you want him. Theres so many great things in this game. heat vision goggles, sniper rifles, string cameras, toxic darts, whatever you could imagine. Don't hesitate to get this game, you wont be dissapointed."
5,Best!,"This game changed the way I look at Video games. I love Video Games, but I'm not the most skilled player. This game however even allowed someone like me to enjoy game play. If I got to a part I couldn't pass I'd just set it aside for a day or two come back and work through it. This is a game that made me want to try again.What is great is that everything come together with this game. The graphics, acting and game itself all work together to give you the ultimate gaming experience. I have never been into these type of games but Splinter Cell keeps me coming back for more and now I eagerly await the sequel. I only hope it is as well put together as Splinter Cell and hope they keep the same actor playing as Sam he does a great job!"
3,splinter cell,The only thing i really like about this game is killing bad guys.Splinter cell was way too hard and hard games are really really boring.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I cant believe how great this game is its soo coolIf your wondering i played it for X-Box and i loved it.i was so glad to hear it was comming out for Game Cube.DONT HESATATE BUY IT WHEN IT COMES OUT!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good Product....Totally satisfied!!,"A good buy for the price, this charger fits perfectly in my car. Charges efficiently and the charger's wire length can be adjusted ."
4,Very good product.,Product arrived in a good shape and it arrived very early.. I am certainly going to buy more stuff from them.
5,like it,"Retractables just take up less space among all the head phone wires, chargers, and you name it junk in our console between the van seats."
5,Audio through CAT5 - perfect,"I purchased this product to deliver audio from my computer jukebox through to my shop amp through 100' of cat5 that was already installed (infrastructure) in the shop. I previously tried a FM transmitter (wholehousefmtransmitter.com), but got unreliable results so I figured something hardwired was needed. I purchased two of this units (one for each end) and they work flawlessly. Yes, I could have manufactured something myself, but this is a slick well constructed. quality product that saved me hours of fabrication."
5,Very happy.,"The first thing I saw upon opening the package, was the very pretty presentation box in which the earrings were sitting. The earrings were just as depicted, but better. The picture doesn't really do them justice as the silver filligree work is more detailed than can be seen on a monitor.The earrings are of excellent quality, as good as you would buy from any good quality jewellery store.Delivery was also good - just eight days from America to Australia.Thank you Peora."
5,"Mystical, spell binding, relaxing and at the same time sturr","I first heard Ms Sumac in the 1950's. As a teen, I was interested in a vast variety of music most of which has long been forgotten. Not so with Ms. Sumac. While sitting in a gazebo over the lagoon here in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, I entered into a discussion with a recording collector. To my suprise, he not only knew of Yma Sumac, he directed me to this site. I plan to restart my collection today and share with the community here in paradise."
1,Not what you think,"I had this cd shipped to my husband in prison and although shipping was not a problem, when he received this product it came with 2 of disc 1 when this was supposed to be a double disc set, not only that but it was an edited version of it, which was not clearly specified when i ordered it"
1,"Ignore that ""Explicit Lyrics"" label","The preview samples of this album have adult language filtered out, be warned, that is NOT a trick to prevent kids from hearing the cursing: THESE REALLY ARE THE RADIO VERSIONS OF THESE SONGS. The ""record-scratch"" to fade out some lyrics is so unbelievably excessive in some tracks that the songs become nearly unrecognizable. If you're looking for a good album to remember the days when rap was good, then keep looking. This version of this album is just going to piss you off."
4,"""Once again we bring armageddon""","Having heard ""I see nothing but flesh"" and ""At the entrance to hell's unholy fire"" I purchased this album. Those two tracks are the best one's, but the sound is consistant with no bad track's, although some do drag on a bit. Basically this album has death, almost brutal male vocals, with clean female vocals, and some electronic beats and keyboard. It has very anti-christian lyrics which are nothing original, and the music and male vocals are less melodic than I usually like, but the female vocal's are exceptional, Jonna Enckell has an excellent voice and really delivers it emotionally. One for fans of heavier sound's rather than more gothic sounding band's, it is more like Dark tranquillity than Theatre of tragedy."
4,coool,"This game was so fun . you can race your horses and breed them. I only gave this game four stars because you cant feed or train your horses. Everything depends on stragedy you have to save your horses energy till the end. I think this game was awesome. I recomend it to all ages. I think this game is worth the money. Even if your not horse crazy youll still love this game. Me and my friend play against each other. Ofcourse I always win. LOL. If you are horse crazy then you would defintly like this game. If you like this game you'll also lik G1 Jockey 3, Gallop Racer,Gallop Racer 2001, and Gallop Racer 2003. have fun!(...)"
1,Review of Elementary Matric Theory,"This book was a waste of money. The author does not know how to communicate with an average reader. So much for calling itself ""Elementary"" ..."
4,A Smooth and Sultry Journey........,"Just listened to some of the samples and found the music to be reflective, cool and hot, all at the same time."
2,"Just a mere,glossy,commercial excercise.","Don't get me wrong !I like Natalie Cole,but certainly this CD is not her best at all.She has done WONDERFUL things in the past!There's a lot of excellent material here,the greatest names in the music industry,Tommy LiPuma's production is absolutely fantastic( maybe a little too much..).It is not that easy to switch overnight from pop(which is not a bad thing !) to jazz,only because competition is much stronger in the pop arena...Probably she will make it as a bestseller,and I do hope so.But she doesn't have the style of Anita Baker,the passion and phrasing of Regina Belle,the spirit and ardour of Patti Austin..It's like a beautiful,glossy magazine...with great pictures and no articles...There's just no heart,no feelings,depth..."
4,This Woman Definitely Knows!,"I'm not sure what this albums naysayers were expecting, but I, for one, find very little fault in this highly enjoyable and remarkably well-made and well-performed release. Cole again shows why she is the daughter of a ""king"". She explores similar territory of her legendary father yet she shows her own individuality on such fine selections as the bossa nova-influenced ""Tell Me About It"", the title cut, ""You're Mine You"", the ethereal, Sergio Mendes-sounding ""So Many Stars"", ""I'm Glad There is You"", ""Better Than Anything"", and ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" and the evocative ""Calling You""."
4,I've waited so long for this..,"The anticipation was killing me! Finally, a new release from my all time favorite diva! While I would have preferred a new R&B;/Pop album, Ms. Cole truly delivers on this collection. She has grown so much as an artist. Listen to her beautiful vocals on ""You're Mine You""..her scating on ""My Baby Just Cares For Me"", and for die hard soul fans, check out her take on ""Calling You""..Great duet with Diana Krall on ""Better Than Anything""..and Lord, she looks fierce!!All in all, I am very pleased with this set. Definitely check it out!!"
5,Absolutely incredible and timeless CD,This CD brings past and present sounds together in a beautiful way. Natalie Coles voice is incredible and unmatched in todays market. Track 3 is my fav. I listen to it over and over.
4,underrated for sure,"this is one underrated cd... there is not one bad song on it...she sure knows how to pick and deliver the goods...the production is excellent..here are some of my favorites...ask a woman who knows,i havent got anything better to do, tell me all about it,better than anything(duet with diana krall), i told you so,calling you and the music that makes me dance... if you love really good music, and ""real singing"",dont pass this up, you will be very glad you purchased it..."
4,My Type,"This lovely CD turns eight this year. I'm glad to have just added it to my collection. Natalie Cole turns in a stunning performance on the standard ""My Baby Just Cares for Me"" with Gary Foster's delightful tenor sax solo. The opener is a lovely crooner breakup song, ""I only sit home & wait for his phone call when I haven't got anything better to do..."" ""Tell Me All About It"" is a Michael Franks song that sways with a lovely bossa nova rhythm, ""You, you're the quiet shy type; You always whisper, never shout it, Oooo, baby, you're my type."" The title track is also a tear-in-your-beer crooner. The rest of the set is sweet and pleasurable. This is a great find, especially eight years after the fact! :) Enjoy!"
4,Natalie Sparkles,"Shes back!! And in a great way! Ask A Woman Who Knows is an enjoyable assortment of jazzy songs and cool evening blends with images of swaying palms or high swing jazz clubs. Her duet with Diana Krall will be a new classic I think, what a perfect pair!!My favorite tracks are Its Crazy, So Many Stars, Better than Anything, Tell Me All About It is very catchy, and the best one is Natalies rendition of My Baby Just Cares for Me. Her new home with Verve looks to be a promising and bright musical road ahead. If you enjoy upbeat jazz and romantic slow jazz then you will enjoy this. Like mentioned in the other review, the majority is more slow and rainy day material but there is enough upbeat to balence it out pretty well. Natalie sounds renewed and as sparkling as ever!"
3,Does not fit the Sportrak,This model does not fit the Sportrak series.Order the 701259 Bracket instead.
4,It works,"What can I say, this gizmo works...it's awkward, but it works. I personally think you shouldn't be looking at a tiny gps screen while you're driving. I sure learned that. Get the Pioneer built in auto gps with a large color screen and voice directions...much safer."
3,Not perfect.,"1. If you intend to use a serial/power cable with this bracket, the screw retainer used to hold the connector to the GPS is hard to get at due the the bracket's arm. Now, this may not be an issue if the bracket holds the GPS in securely enough against the connector pins - [edit] turns out this is a non-issue.2. Because it is mounted from the top (window) and hands down, the GPS moves around a lot and depending on where you locate it, it can vibrate against the dash. [edit] the vibration on the dash is a big issue. You need to put a piece of rubber or felt on the bottom of the bracket.I think if you have the surface space, the swivel mount is probably the better option. I am going to order one and try it out."
3,Bracket,"The item is good, except now and then one of the suction cups will loosen and the GPS receiver drops to the dashboard."
4,Games,"This is a great video game,it is a little hard but it is a great game,I would for sure reccomend this game and the seller that I bought the game from.Thank You."
4,good game and price.,"I'm not saying oh this game rocks! it's a very good game but unfortanetly too hard. I'm only on the third level in world two but can't get past it. That's not a big problem for me because I've got three other games and might get Metroid Prime Hunters also, that's not it I also like to beat the levels I already beat. I really can't say much else about it but the last thing is the cool moves the turtles do, they're more athletic in this game than the Ninja Turtles in Super Nintendo."
4,Help found in prayer ...,"I found this book looking for a personal way to participate in the Roman Catholic Liturgy begun with attendance of the Sunday's Eucharist. It is a condensed easily accessed Office similarily patterned to that found in ""The Book of Common Praayer"" though identified as being in the Catholic tradition.It's Office is organized around a seven day calendar, including both morning and evening prayer and a common night prayer, with additions for special times of the church year, ie. Advent, Easter, Lent, Pentecost. This Office is ordered in such a way that it could easily be used in a communal setting. Also it contains prayers for times of special need from authors such as Thomas Merton and Lucien Deiss.This is not a how-to-book but fills the need for those of us who are looking for a companion along the journey of private prayer."
4,Fit Full-Grown Pug Well,"The dress part of this costume fit my pug very well, but the elastic on the hat was a little to long for her small head so I had to tie a couple knots it the elastic to make it fit. Other than that, it was cute and everyone thought she was cute in it."
3,Dogge costume,"It's very pretty and looks extremely cute on a dog, but the material is very fragile. The bottom of the costume, made of tulle, ripped right off. The size chart is off. according to the size chart my dog's size should've been medium, so i did, turns out it was too big for her, she was a small. The hat won't stay on, and she steps on the tulle when she walks."
4,Fun but there are better games out there,"I had recieved this game for Christmas and I find it quite enjoyable. The concept of the game is very simple:You slide the box forward and then back again revealing two tiles. You must think of a word that begins with the first letter and ends with the second. ExampleLetters are:A LWord Possible: AnimalWho ever yells out a word first that works gets the tiles. When the tiles dispencer is empty, you count up your tiles and whoever has the most wins.If you are looking for a good travel game I do not suggest this one because the tiles can be lost easily. I do suggest this game for kids ages 7+ because you have to have a good vocabilary of words."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I'll be the first to admitt that I'm not a big word game person. However, I have friends that love the word games, so I make comprimises. I found this game was slow and boring.The game gives you a set of letters and the object is to shout out a word that starts and ends with the letters given for each round. I only played this game with 1 other person, and it may be more fun if you have a larger group. However, we were stumped on a lot of combinations and/or took quite a bit of time to anwser. This made the game very slow and not a barrel of laughs. I like to be entertained when playing a game, and especially a party game, and this to me was simply boring.Final Verdict: Probably a good teaching tool, but there are much better party games out there."
4,Good brain strain motivator,"Have been using this game as a kinesthetic approach to vocabulary study/enhancement. Very good brain stimulation. May be difficult for some students, however, for any possibility of dual beginning letters(sounds)and/or endings may appear. Yet once students get the hang of the game (which happens rather quickly), it is quite a learning tool. There are few parts, no multiple stimulating/distracting items (such as timers, dice, or beepers) so participants can learn to focus on the objective only. Great for a middle school or high school class."
5,Great Family Fun,This game is fun for the entire family and has several variations you can play so the game can be different every time you play.
5,Fantastic teaching tool!,My little group of reading-challenged kids absolutely love this game! It forces them to think and sound out words while having a great time. They can't wait until we play it again!
1,cracked bottle,Bottle was improperly packaged and arrived cracked on the top with shampoo oozing out. Part of the box was soaked.
4,IMPRESSIVE MODERN OPERA,"A very interesting example o modern music. But as is the rule today badly staged and direct. I hope we shall have in DVD soon LEAR, perhaps the best oper of Reimann."
2,"Disjointed, full of jargon, arrogant","Contrary to the editorial reviews, this book is full of jargon, it's disjointed and superficial (probably partly due to its breadth), the concepts are poorly explained, and Bronner gives no concrete examples to illustrate the concepts. I have read approximately 40 books on critical theory. This is the worst I have read so far. Kellner, Held, Jay, and Geuss are far more accessible -- they write as if they and their audience share the same language and expectations. The book does have one redeeming quality: Bronner critically evaluates the logical coherence and contributions of various critical theorists in a manner that is not likely to be found in other works. But even for this, be prepared to strongly disagree with Bronner on any critical theorists you happen to have read beforehand."
1,"wide ranging, yes, but ultimately the work of a dilettante","I found it rather odd that a work of real merit could spring from an author who has no familiarity with subject. He might as well have written about cold fusion for all he added, or didn't add to field.It seems he was attempting to span a wide array of topics, but with no direction or articulate point of view.In the end, the attempt was wholly lacking."
3,good if you like puzzles,"Purchased this item as a gift for my mom. She spent over two hours trying to untangle the strings. Finally gave up and cut some off. Not the experience I was hoping to give her. Mom still liked the butterflies and thought they were beautiful, this was the saving grace."
5,Personal Item,I have been wearing this panty for many years and it was no longer available at local department store. So pleased that I found it on Amazon. I received exactly what I ordered in a timely fashion and was very pleased with the price.
2,Very mislead,I have no issue with the brief as I have ordered them before directly from this same source however the briefs come in a package of 2 which is what I was expecting. The cost was a few dollars more than when I ordered them directly and not through Amazon. My complaint is that the company sent me only one brief that had been removed from the Bali package of two so I ended up paying more than double for one brief. I called the company and customer service agreed that one package containing 2 briefs should have been sent. The Bali briefs are no longer available. I returned the brief and got a refund however my shipping cost of $5.99 was not refunded. Needless to say I am not happy with this company that sells products through Amazon.
3,"I have no tactics,...","One has to think very quickly to apply and interpret the Art of War. It is not a book for the light reader. It is alot like numbers. When one searches for a number one will find it everywhere. The precepts and theme of this book is to number one's steps in warfare, to know that there is always a limit to how many victories one may have in battle just as one's days are limited in this life. The best way to understand this book is to read it at least one thousand and one times in ones life, then one will have mastered the Art of War."
2,Hmmm ...,"This is the translation I ordered, but wasn't the one I got, so I can't comment specifically on THIS version, which, I'm told, is excellent. I received a version by Gary Gagliardi.I'm not terribly happy with it - too much ""how to apply it to Corporate America and Defeat Your Competitors"" interpretation and too little translation. There's also a blatent appeal to the reader to purchase the authors corporate supplemental training seminars - before one gets 3 pages into the text. Really didnt' like that ...I'll try ordering it again - c'est la vie ..."
4,A good game,"I didn't love the transition from a 2D side scroller to 3D on the N64, and Castlevania has had trouble making that transition. This game is fun, but it has it's issues. Worth playing, though."
3,"A fan of Castlevania, but this one just OK","It has been long that we compare every Castlevania to Symthony of the night. This one is 3D view but the graphic is just OK. Forging demond pets are the bulk of the content but to me it seems not much fun there. THe maps are a bit boring since the rooms are quite similar to each other.After all although I am a big fan of the serie since 1987 but this one is just OK, acceptable but not a milestone for sure."
2,Waste of time and $$$,"I was expecting much more from this game based on the rep of castlevania. Unfortunately, this game did not even come close to my expectations. The enemies are replicated throughout the game, only they level up as you do. If they weren't hard in level 1, they won't be hard as a level 25 or 30. The replay value of this game is 0 because for the most part the storyline won't change based on certain actions you take."
2,"It starts out ok, but the last level is a whip to your face","Castlevania has long been one of my favorite games, the original, the third one, super castlevania 4 on the snes, and finally their sgt. peppers, symphony of the night. This game drove me gradually insane throughout. They keep using the tired metroid formula (using your newly found abilities to access new areas of the game) which was introduced in 1985(!!!!!!!). The end is an equally punishingly old-school romp where they make you not only fight every enemy again but also give you some 4 stage end boss that just keeps regenerating itself (ugggggggggg). Can't they move on from this 20 year old game convention? The N64 games were more fresh than this, and everyone hates them. But this is rated as a step up somehow. Overall, the antiquated design and slow pacing put this game securely in it's coffin."
3,Meh another cash in.,"Don't get me wrong its not a bad game but frankly Konami is following in Capcoms step of relaseing games that are a shadow of what they where and not really evolving the gameplay after that,Castlevania in 3D was always missing something this one is no different for a real gamer is on the menu but for someone whos not interested is fooling with the gimmicks shallow story and gameplay move on to another title.BTW Konami/Capcom put the darn Japaneses tracks in these games the US voice acting is horrid...."
2,"Okay, but not worth the money","The one major problem that I have with this game is that it seems very short and small. Compared with the other games in the series, Curse of Darkness doesn't have as many secrets or hidden items to find. For example, you could spend months trying to acquire all the extra stuff in Symphony of the Night. And Lament of Innocence had hundreds of hidden items. I don't think that the replay value of this game is very high, and the gameplay controls (especially the camera angles) were not very smooth. I got the feeling that Konami rushed this game to get it to market. The storyline wasn't as interesting as previous games. Even when it is considered independently of the other series games, it just isn't all that great. I think that the money could be better spent elsewhere."
5,There hasn't been a Castlevania like this before,"Excellent game. Bought mine, new from my local store, and have not been able to let go of it. This one is a very good game of the Castlevania series, can't compare to Lament of Innocence because of the type of hero (Belmont Vs Devil Forge Master). Can say though that now we have both the types of heroes in two of the best titles of the series, and on the PS2.The story is that classic to Castlevania, the gameplay has improved since LOI, the graphics are a little better too, and the best of all, is way longer than LOI, I haven't finish it 100% yet! not to mention Crazy Mode (mostly because some technical dificulties with my PS2 though).The new ""Devil Forge Master""ing, the new ""Item Creation"", the good ol' fashioned-better-graphic-infused familiars... there hasn't been a Castlevania like this one before.All in all, if you like Castlevania, and liked LOI, and SOTN you'll LOVE COD."
3,Augh! it happened again.,"Why does Konami keep putting out substandard, C- list Castlevania games?The word 'tedious' doesn't begin to describe the experience of playing this. Imagine moving a character around that can't walk any faster than a small dog, through the most bland, monotonous environments you could imagine, fighting the dullest enemies you could imagine- over, and over, and over, and over.It has some good cutscenes and decent voice acting, but you can really tell the overall production values were really low for this. That's a shame...Castlevania has always been one of my all-time favorites. They'd never release such a mediocre Zelda or Metal Gear game, for good reason. This deserves to be a top-tier franchise, but Konami refuses to give it the time/money it would take to really do it right."
3,AVERAGE CASTLEVANIA GAME,"If you are a Castlevania fan, you should get this game, if you're not, stay away, this is a very long repetitive game, the story is great, the carachters, some have depth, and others you just don't know what to make of them. In conclusion this game is not bad but it's not great.Play On!!!!"
2,good but not great!!!!,"this game is just like any other of the castlevania franchise....the plot is way to simple and not intriging at all...your girlfriend gets killed by the bad guys and you want revenge....WOW!!!!!!!!!! INTERESTING!!!!!!!! it took a genius to figure that one out!! anyways the controls are very confusing, the character just looks like alucard therefore not giving it originality as they said it has......grafics are not too crisp anyways......the soundscore its nice thou, but not as nice as synphony of the night....its not a bad game , but you wouldn't want to pay 50 on this one...wait until it goes down to at least 30.00...save 20 bucks and buy a greatest or platinum hit........thats my honest advice..."
2,Not as good as the ones on Nintendo 64,"I really did not like this game at all b/c it was nothing like the Nintendo 64 Castlevanias. It was mach more fun on Nintendo. When I bought this game I expected it to be like the old ones I played, but it was not as near as fun as the 64 Games. The playstation 2 castlevania games have no direction at all. You just are lost and walk around forever. Theres nothing great about it. Pretty much what Im trying to say is it does not have a very good story line. It is wack. All out of order. I love hard statagey games where you have to find things and put them in order and all that stuff, but this one sucked:("
5,Dreamin Out Loud,"This is a great cd, the ballads are songs people can relate to. I enjoyed listening to this cd as you see another side of Trace's great voice."
4,A good CD to people who likes country music,"This is a really good CD, Trace Adkins is a cool Country artist, if you like country music, or if you are not sure if you like it, buy this CD."
3,Served my needs,"I don't really feel qualified to rate or even comment on this product. I wanted music to accompany a presentation I made with many pictures I took on a trip to St. Louis. I used two tracks because the city's name was in the titles. The music in this album reminds me of the merry-go-round scene in the movie, ""The Sting,"" as all the tracks carry the ""oompa,"" big-band sounds captured in circus-like organs. The mood is upbeat, 1890s, strawberry-blond girl in a swing type of thing."
1,A real disappointment,"I am hesitant to write a really bad review, but some books deserve it.The point of a book like this is to teach you how to use a tool. The problem is that this book doesn't do it. The authors do not fully explain the examples. For example, on page 45 they display a dialog box, but never tell you how to get to it. The examples don't work; on another page we are told that if you double click on a combo box that certain code will be generated. JDev doesn't generate the code. The book is also based on a beta release of JDev!!! I am not sure why anyone would base a book on beta software.After struggling with the book for hours I gave up. This was really a disappointment for me."
3,"Prophetic, but...","This work was based on an earlier, beta I guess, version of 10g. When working through the examples on the REAL 10g I was severely challenged to figure out what the author was talking about versus what Oracle had actually included in the final version. In one area even the downloaded routines didn't work.The good thing I can say is that this author seems to be the only one to produce a book of this kind! I'm still waiting for my (pre-publication order) copy of the official Oracle Handbook."
1,An Overview book in general J2EE,"Reading some five star recommendations on this page I recommended this book to my client. Now I regret and will return ask for refund. This is more like a collection of White Papers on Jdedevloper and J2EE. Hey, if this is writing a book it is a good business. I really doubt the authors ever used Jdeveloper."
1,a very simple introduction to jdeveloper,I think that this book is just a simple sumary of things you can find online at OTN. I dont think it was helpul at all. Does not provide good examples. If you really want to program dont think that this book is going to help you develop real applications.
1,"Very disappointing, missing pages","The book I bought from Amazon ends abruptly on page 230 of chapter 9. The table of contents lists chapter 10, 11 and Index, which are missing. I'll demand a refund for this incompetence! Wait for the Oracle Press release of Jdeveloper 10G (very detailed for the 9i Jdeveloper)."
5,FINALLY!!!!,"I HATED cartoons as a kid, wanting to watch soap operas and game shows instead... EXCEPT for ""Josie & The Pussycats""!!! Love the songs (find the bootleg CD on ebay if you can), the characters (Alexandra and Melody most of all), and yes, even as an adult, I laugh out loud at some of the campy '70s lingo and jokes...What is REALLY shocking is that I remember almost all of the episodes verbatim except for the last 4 (Disc 2, Side 2)... I'm almost thinking that these weren't shown as part of the syndication package or something when I watched it in the late '70s or on Cartoon Network in the '90s... What a joy to see some ""Josie"" episodes I didn't actually remember!!!While the tribute to Dan DeCarlo certainly was nostalgic and enjoyable, it sure would've been nice to see some ""Where are they now?"" interviews with the ladies (including, of course, Cheryl Ladd) who sang the Pusscats' songs...Now let's hope the ""Pussycats in Outer Space"" gets its due release!!!"
2,No effort whatsoever,"What is the opposite of excelling yourself? Whatever it is, that's what Warners have managed to do with this DVD release. The episode prints are terrible, full of scratches, which I probably wouldn't mind so much if they'd even bothered to keep the correct Hanna Barbera logo at the end of them. The ""extras"" are hardly worthy of the name, and to top it all, the DVD case is very cheap and flimsy. If you're a die-hard fan and it's on sale at a huge discount, then sure, buy it. Otherwise - avoid."
3,"Watchable, but don't expect too much","Josie and the Pussycats is one of the cartoons from my childhood.The wife bought it for me, and it is worth getting. Especially at $14, the price when we got it.However, don't be expecting too much.Josie, for a main character, is amazingly vanilla. Alan is a big lump. Why does Alexandra want him? Speaking of Alexandra, why does everyone else put up with her? I get the brother, but the rest?Fortunately, there are two characters that save the day for me. Melody and Sebastian. Yeah it's the same scene every time, but I just like watching her drum and her comments actually make me laugh. Sebastian is the brains of the outfit and I have never seen a character combine helpfulness and malice so well.The villains are just embarrassing. Midas and Nemo? Seriously? I suspect most of the viewers could have come up with better villains."
3,"good, could be better...","they should have listed the songs for each episode on the inside case, like the Archies dvd.but here is what I could gather of the song listings:1.""The Nemo's a no no affair""song:Roadrunner2.""A greenthumb is not a goldfinger""song:Voodoo3.""The secret six secret""song:Lie, lie, lie4.""Swap plot flop""song:Hand clapping song5.""The Midas mix up""song:Time to Love6.""X marks the spot""song:Stop, look and listen7.""Chili today and hot tamale""song:It's alright with me8.""Never mind a master mind""song:Clock on the wall9.""Plateau of the apes plot""song:I love you too much10.""Strangemoon over Miami""song:Inside Outside upside down11.""All wong in Hong Kong""song:You've come a long way baby12.""Melody memory mix up""song:Roadrunner13.""The great Pussycat chase""song: ??14.""Spy school spoof""song:It's alright with me15.""The jumpin' Jupiter affair""song:You've come a long way baby16.""don't count on a Countess""song:With every beat of my heart"
2,The Pussycats Never Sounded Worse,"Very disappointed in the quality of the audio track, and the video dirt. The bonus feature about Dan DeCarlo was nice but more features could have been added about the singers Cathy Dougher, Cherie Moor (AKA Cheryl Ladd) and Patrice Holloway. If you were looking to replace your taped episodes off the TV with this set, don't toss them out just yet. Maybe the'll get it right next DVD set but not here."
3,Cooler,"The cooler is nice. The power pack went out three min. after I plug it in. The Addi company is of no help, they don't carry parts, so I had to return the whole unit for a replacement, when only the power unit was out."
2,The ADDI 3 in 1 water cooler/ice maker /counter washer,I bought this water cooler for xmas. It worker great for a couple weeks. Then you go to get water and its not giving water. Look inside and theres a chunk of ice the size of a softball. You turn it off to let it melt and the unit drips water all over the place. I won't buy anything else for that company.
2,Frost: don't confuse him with Foyle,"Was looking for another UK show that would be of the quality of Foyles War. Read reviews from other purchasers, and noted that the show is in something like its 15 season, so it has obviously attracted a loyal audience. It's a nice show, but nothing to approach the quality of Foyles War. We won't be buying any more episodes past this one."
2,Dvd purchase,"I love Amazon, and for the most part, all of their businesses delivery service has been excellent, except for this company! It took them 3 weeks to deliver one set of Dvd's. I had stuff I ordered a week or two later, arrive before these did! Not happy with delivery, but Dvd's are brand new and in good condition."
5,One of my favorite series,"The entire series is among my favorites and the initial season really sets the tone for the complete (and lengthy) series. The casts are excellent, the acting is first rate, the scripts are top notch, and the overall effect is as good as it gets. Some day I hope to have a good many more DVD's in this series."
4,remarkably prescient,"Considering when it was written, the author of this book should be credit for foresight in taking this supposedly ""fringe"" stuff seriously. Now that we've got ""Wired"" into the debate, one might pooh-pooh that, but this was written before the fall of the Soviet Union, much less the rise of the WWW and the dot-com bubble.I read it in high school, so I don't recall details, but I do remember that it was very entertaining."
5,I LOVE Carol Finch Books!!,This was a great book. I am never disappointed reading C. Finch. She always gives a great story and lots of steam between the two main characters. Right from the first I was on Moriah's side. If I would have had to deal with what all she went thru I would want to become a hermit too. Devlin falls in love while teaching the independant Moriah how to take care of herself in the wild mountains. Then the story gets upped a notch when Moriah looses her sight. That is when all the confusion and misconstrued feelings all take place. The thing is -when I am reading this book I can understand and feel everything that the main character is going thru. I laughed a few times too. Overall this is a great read. If you have a chance I think you will enjoy it.
4,Vintage Collections by Tex Ritter,"Fun to listen to,happy country songs. Good to play when gramps is around."
1,Garbage,"I honestly didn't even want to give it the one star. Piece of garbage. The ball broke right off the base while I was putting it on. Bought it as a replacement for my Mazda OEM mirror, which had started to delaminate. Off to the Mazda dealer I go."
4,Machiavelli Misunderstood?,"I read this book while researching the ""Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion."" Clearly ""Protocols"" was heavily plagiarized from this work and was a forgery to boot. In any event, this is a captivating tale of a conversation between Machiavelli (counselor to despots) and Montesquieu (philosophical and political father of the U.S. Constitution.) Machiavelli claims to be misunderstood but as the dialogue progresses it seems painfully evident that he is generally not.While Machiavelli and Montesquieu both claim to be followers of Christ, it becomes clear to everyone but Machiavelli that he operates out of self-interest rather than the good of society. His self-delusion is phenomenal and is readily seen in politics today. The book is obscure, true, but I found it to be a page-turner. Do not pass judgment on this book because someone later used it for anti-Semitic purposes. There is nothing anti-Semitic in this original tale."
2,wanna buy a Keiser stationary bike?,"The book is pretty basic and does a great job of pushing Keiser products. If I would have glanced through it in a bookstore instead of ordering it on-line, I would have had the jist of the material in less than 3 minutes and left the book on the shelf. There not enough focus on actual workout programs (I only count 7 in the book, 2-25 min, 3-40 min, and 2-1 hour plans) and a lot more focus on weight use ON the stationary bike. The title says ""complete workout programs for high-level fitness"" however my light/typical workouts are about 1 hour. Since there are only 2 programs for this duration, indoor training will get very dull, very quick. In short, look elsewhere for training programs.M. McCormick5-time ironman finishercycling instructorcollegiate cyclist"
2,Overpriced & poor quality,"I got this thing cause it was really cool looking and I've heard all these rave reviews about silicon cookware. It would've been a better deal if the craftmanship was better. The inner ring which holds the silicon sieve in place is plastic with poor retainment notches, thus, if you try to drain something heavy, the whole thing plummets out and you're holding this oversized bubble-wand looking collander. Weak."
5,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"A boy named Charlie and his mother and four grandparents are very poor. Willy Wonka has put five golden tickets in his candy bars they are sold all over the world. Whoever gets the the tickets gets to tour Willie Wonka's chocolate facory. Charlie's birthday is coming up and when Charlie finds out he really wants a chocolate bar with a golden ticket. Then one day when Charlie is walking home he finds 2 quarters and a dime. He goes to the store and buys a chocolate bar and gets the last golden ticket. Charlie takes Grampa Joe to the chocolate factory. If you want to find out about their adventures through the factory, you should read this book. I liked it because it was very exciting."
5,"Great, great Kern songs!!","Love Jerome Kern. Didn't know all these songs were his. Love, love, love it. Would recommend it anyone who loves Kern or that period of songs."
3,Enjoyable listening,"I saw the movie about the life of Jerome Kern, and wanted the CD. The artist that are singing are from the movie. I would have liked it better if they were artist of today."
2,Jetz trouble,"This game has a lot of potential for entertaining kids. However, I've had the same trouble as the other listings. We can never move on to another mission because the system always fails and I have to physically reboot time and time again! It's very frustrating for my 5 year old son who just loves the game. Too bad that THQ doesn't have much of a customer support program. Maybe they know the troubles and don't wish to accept responsibility."
4,"Fly, fire, fun!","This game rocks. After a very simple installation, it ran quite well. Best when used with a Joystick, it takes a bit of getting used to as far as control goes, but once you have it down, it's a lot of fun! There could be more levels, but the free-fly mode lets you wander around shooting little army men, and you can go through the levels again and again. At the price, it's well worth the money, and I'm sure I'll keep coming back to play it again and again! (If you like Toy Commander, this is an exceptional game to satisfy your 'needs' on the PC!)"
5,Leviton... who else?,"Well, not much to say other than there isn't a whole lot of competition out there. I remodeled my home with Leviton switches, plugs, wall plates, CAT5e quick ports, etc. I did use more expensive stainless steel wall plates from the Expo in my kitchen to match the appliances. In hindsight, I should of settled for the cheapest."
1,Does not fit Cat6 keystones,"I needed this to fit Cat6 keystones, and every brand I tried would not fit because the horizontal spacing between the keystone ports was too small."
4,It made me want to read more about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,"Not only was it a fascinating ""whodunnit"" but it was also an interesting historical account of a remarkable individual who made many varied contributions--besides literary--to society during his lifetime."
4,behind sherlock holmes,Interesting historical fiction account of Arthur Conan Doyle with emphasis on his actions to solve real mysteries. Julian Barnes does a fine job with this book.
5,First and definitely not last Julian Barnes book,Great book! Wonderful plot with great characters and plot twists. Loved the juxtaposition and then intersection of two very different turn of the century lives. Can't wait to read more works by this author!
2,"Very intriguing start, but then....","This novel could have gone anywhere, and I was sure that after the presentation of George's situation, there was more interesting observations coming. I hadn't read the jacket fly and didn't know who Arthur was until I got to it. Here was another intriguing twist, but I quickly became aware that what at first appeared to be a character-driven story became a quite ordinary plot-driven mystery, but an unsatisfying one, despite the author's obvious writing skills. There just wasn't a satisfying ending to be had, and it came to a clunking end after page after page of mundane detail."
4,Interesting,"This book was quite good. I certainly learned a lot about Arthur Conan Doyle and his interest in spiritualism, and about his feeelings toward his greatest creation. He resented being defined by his Sherlock Holmes series, and hated feeling patronized by both the police and general public. It was a little redundant in places, but overall an eye opening commentary on what can happen when society makes judgements based on race and class."
2,Disappointing,I found this story tedious and confusing. It was really difficult to feel commitment to either character. It felt pompous and awkward. Birdcage
3,"Interesting concept, boring execution","Julian Barnes keeps things interesting from the childhoods of the two men leading up to their adult lives. During that time I could barely put the book down. But then the writing starts to drag. Arthur's details become insignificant. George's story continues to intrigue, but by then everything is a bit predictable. Barnes rushes through the what should have been the best part of the book - when Arthur finally clears George's name. After getting past that, I could barely bring myself to finish the book. In fact, I don't think I did."
3,Elegant but. . .,"I wanted to like this book--but after about 120 pages realised I didn't care enough about the characters or the story to continue (except for maybe George's poor father). Julian Barnes is an elegent stylist but style came to stifle the progress of the narrative for me--it achieved archness, which is death to historical fiction. I did turn to the end to confirm guilt or innocence. Maybe I missed some good courtroom dialogue. . ."
3,mystery and prejudice,"Interesting book with Arthur Conan Doyle, inventor of Sherlock Holmes, as the protaganist. George is unjustly imprisoned, released with a blemish on his record which Doyle tries to remove."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I have less than 100 pages to go and am not going to finish it. Took me many weeks to get this far. I give up. If you must read it, borrow it from the library!"
4,Barnes fully back in form,"Here goes somewhat lazy advice to potential readers of ""Arthur and George"":1) If you know nothing about the book, don't read any reviews, the backflaps etc... the gradual revelations are fantastic and certainly one of the beauties of this novel2) If you don't know Julian Barnes, and are in doubt whether you should read this book, read ""History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters"". Just the first story will be enough to remove any doubt he is a writer worth reading3)If you've read Barnes' ""England England"" and couldn't finish it, as I couldn't, don't worry - Barnes is back in excellent form.4)If none of the above apply, please refer to some of the at times touching reviews that follow just below."
4,"Show me the way to go, Holmes","Yes, this book is based on facts (ARTHUR Conan Doyle and GEORGE Edalji) and touches on the Holmsian aspect of ACD's life. And yet.Mr. Barnes uses prose that makes one sit up, notice, and revel in the words and the meaning and the pictures they draw. The plot is interesting, but the manner in which Mr. Barnes introduces us to the characters, then slowly draws out the strands of the story is a marvel. His use of language is - as always - brilliant.I was disappointed in some aspects of the plot, but - then again - I wasn't reading it for what happened so much as I was reading it for the joy of surrounding myself in a well-written paragraph.Truly a wonderful book!"
4,Arthur and George: synchronicity and idiosyncracy,"I enjoyed this book. The technique chosen by Julian Barnes seems particularly appropriate: we view forms of justice through the perspective of prejudice while at the same time seeing how adherence to a belief in justice impedes the attainment of it.Both Arthur and George are very much men of their times and respective classes. Importantly, for the authenticity of the story, this is portrayed without offending more modern equalitarian sensibilities.Highly recommended."
1,No Sense of an Ending,"I selected this book because I loved The Sense of an Ending. Arthur and George needed major editing. It plods on forever. Finally at about 70% it started to pick up. It goes over and overthe same case. I'm going to finish it because after investing so much time, I would like to know how it plays out."
2,ARTHUR AND GEORGE,"TO MUCH DETAILS TO MAKE THE POINT. NOT WRITTEN SMOOTHLY, FELT LIKE IT WAS TRANSLATED FROM AN OTHER LANGUAGE. NOT FINISHED, ARTHUR AND GEORGE ARE JUST NOW MEETING."
3,Only George comes to life,"""Arthur and George"" is a novelist's reconstruction of the lives of two Victorian era individuals whose lives interesected: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and a man he helped prove innocent of the crime for which he was in prison: GeorgeEdalji. Had Julian Barnes been assigned this subject as an exercise, I would have given his effort more credit than I do. Barnes does a wonderful job with George, but I found his Arthur interesting, but lifeless: perhaps Barnes was too constrained by what is known about the real world figure. As a detective story - the investigation of the crime George was alleged to have committed - the novel definitely has its moments, and the social history is a plus. Still, the novel too often plods along. For a much richer novel, which also provides a slice of Victorian era social history, I recommend ""English Passengers"" by Matthew Kneale"
4,What you did not know about Sherlock Holmes,"When working on a jigsaw puzzle have you noticed how hard it is at the beginning of construction, it is unclear what the actual picture will turn into and as you approach the end the pieces fall into place quickly and clearly. This book is like that. Julian Barnes feeds you information on a ""need to know"" basis. All of sudden, you are illuminated!! Author is Sir Author Conan Dole, George is east indian...and little by little the pieces begin to fit and you are hitting yourself on the head thinking, ""I should have known this...""Yes this is a book that resulted in ""googling"" for background information on the story and characters and I learned that it is the story of Sir Author and George Edalji told in increments.I did not read any reviews prior to reading this book--it was a Booker Prize winner and that was why I had downloaded a sample. The sample had me hooked.This is the second book I have read by Julian Barnes and so far he has not disappointed!!"
4,"An enjoyable read, maybe a bit lopsided","I enjoyed this book quite a bit, my first foray into Julian Barnes' territory. I must agree though with some earlier comments which suggest that George is the more interesting character, given short shrift by the author in favor of the larger, more blustery and more famous figure. I didn't always find the character of Arthur convincing and felt at time that Barnes was weighing the chapters too heavily with factual researched information of the period and the man. I also was left unmoved by the love affair, which I just didn't really give a hoot about -- I would have much rather Barnes delved more deeply into George's literal-minded and curious ways of behaving. Still, a pleasant and involving read. I could have happily read another hundred pages."
3,Great sleeping aid.,"I fell asleep everytime I tried to read this book. I got about 120 pages into it before I finally forgot to pick it up again (it's gathering dust on my nightstand).Too much detail for me, especially of the legal preceedings and horse murders. I think Barnes did so much research he was loathe not to use every bit of it.Still, if you have stamina and such things are of particular interest, you may like it very well. It is authentic and you may learn things about Arthur Conan Doyle that you did not know before."
3,Disappointing,"Arthur and George is by turns brilliant and excruciatingly boring. The first one third of the book, where we get to know the two main characters, is fabulous. Unfortunately, it sets a high bar for the rest of the book, which in my opinion, didn't deliver.The writing was absolutely beautiful, the characterization is superb, but the plot itself is stretched thin- by the time Arthur and George actually meet, you feel like the book could be over. Towards the end I found myself wanting to finish it just for the sake of finishing it, not because I really cared about what happened next."
4,Christian funk? What an idea!,"Christian music is not strictly Southern Gospel and pop rock, that's for sure. But 70s funk music? Who would have thought? This CD is fresh groove with basslines that make you move. You have GOT to hear these guys!"
2,i'm a disapointed fan,"i've seen soulfood live as many times as i've been to the dentist. let's face it, they rock with funkalicious domination. BUT. their CD is garbage in comparison. it is very poorly made and because of that doesn't show the real talent that God has given those guys. it just doesn't cut it."
1,Soulfood is Spoiled!,"The music bores me and the grooves are weak. Come on people, go listen to Sly Stone if you want to get your groove on. Vocals? None here."
5,Mounted on Motorcycle,"I have this mount on my motorcycle (cruiser). Quick to mount, rubber gasket to protect the handlebars, easy to snap the GPS in and out so that the Megellan does not get stolen. Easy to read the GPS when in the mount. Simple, clean, easy, secure - does exactly what you want it to do. What more could you ask for in a product!"
4,"Simple design, yet stylish","This is a good strap for a beginner. Someone who doesn't need the finest leather and most comfort available out of a strap. Not too many options for size adjustments, but overall a good strap."
3,Works For The Most Part,"I was using a thin plastic strap that really cut into my neck, so I ordered this one. It seems to be made well, and fits flat and smooth around the neck. I have an F-Style Mandolin, so one end slides right over the curl and the other end just ""buttons on"" the the peg at the end. My only problem is the length. It really needs to have 1-2 more slots. The strap would work great for a man, were he could hold it flat to his chest, but for a woman, there is no extra room. You either have to hold it flat (over your breast - which is very uncomfortable), or hope that you're small-busted enough to have it fit directly under the breast. (Just a note of caution for the more endowded ladies). Other than that, it mostly serves the purpose. I may still look for one that is a little longer."
4,Epic Samurai Adventure,Ron Martz and Bart Sears have constructed a cinematic tale abouta monk who becomes a reluctant warrior. Sears gritty art style fits the story's timeframe and locale. There are grand battle scenes and interseting characterizations in this tale mixed with samurai action and fantasy . A great way to jump on this ongoing title from the Crossgen Universe.
4,Whats YOUR Poison?,"I love this,so does my husband.I bought the entire kit which comes in a lovely satin mini duffel-like purse with a handle.it includes body creme,body wash,perfume.it has a bit of a strong introduction.it doesnt smell like pine-sol like others have said.Its like a re-vamping of the original POISON in the purple bottle.except this one has a sweeter and crisper tone.it becomes light and stays fresh with time.id say its a bit fruity/floral.Good for everyday or a special night out."
5,Pure sexy,"I have no idea what the others are talking about.This one smells NOTHING like pine and to me that's a very good thing cause i hate pine in my perfume.I own Hypnotic Poison and it's amazing.Soft,sexy,seductive.One of my friends owned Pure Poison and when i smelt it,like 2-3 years ago,i was hooked for life.The only way i can describe it it's innocently sexy.I tried this out again and the smell stayed on for hours.It smells like something soft,like powder,vanilla,white flowers,night air.It's a perfume for young girls,18 to 30,smells so much like sexy youth!No oldlady-ish smell here.I own the 3.a oz. perfume and i'm so glad i bought it!I've had it with all the candy scented perfumes that turn sickenly sweet after a few hours.This is a perfume that worths trying it even just for once.And to think i hate flowery and feminine scents,but this is it ladies.Only one piece of advice:try before you buy.Something that to me it's godsend to you it may be horrid!"
3,sneeze central,"I bought this because I liked the way it smelled in a magazine, but after you apply it, it starts to turn into a different scent...something that's very strong, makes you want to sneeze, and I would agree that the smell it turns into reminds me of something cheap...."
2,Good at first...boring later,"I loved the smell in the magazines so I decided to get it. Well...it was good at first...and then I got tired. It smells a little cheap and sort of like pine. I sometiems use it, but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits (that's what I use it for).I think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long."
3,Is it worth the money?,im a student and more or less emptied my debit card to pay for one of these and when it arrived i was really excited and felt great in it and when i wore a dress with it i felt really condident however i looked at myself in it today and my tummy doesnt seem flatter at all and my legs and waist dont feel smaller and when i measured myself before and after with the garment there was only a 2-3 cm difference in my waist size and no difference in my hip or leg size and when i put a dress on and took before and after picture i looked vertually the same i could see no difference and nor could my friends who also looked at the picture so im now asking myself was it worth the money and what should i do?
1,It cost less,This item does not cost $195.00 new it cost $168.00 from Ardyss distributors. Don't get your money taken we are in a recession find a distributor in your area.
4,Good Product,"I bought this product from one of the market place sellers called ArdyssSystem and received good service. Its a decent discount (paid about $100 with shipping) compared to how much it retails elsewhere. This is my second Body Magic product as I started with size 30 and then purchased size 28 from this retailer. I promise, the garment is tough to get into the first time but remarkably easier from the second time onwards, because its made to expland to fit your figure. Once you get used to it, its quite comfortable. I also got a hang of how to undo it and put it back on (through the hooks in the crotch area) when I need to go to the bathroom. Interestingly, based on the provided size chart, I should be using size 34, but my friend who sold the first garment to me, said to start with size 30 which I did."
3,review,"When you have to use the bathroom, it is hard to get off. There are no snap/hooks for the groin area for easy access. You have to unhook the whole thigh area all the way around which could take sometime, not to mention hooking it back up when you are finished using the restroom. Consequently, it would be difficult to where out somewhere for any extended period of time."
3,Scum Sucker Sucks Scum,"I've used this a couple of times in my 4' x 4' fountain base. It works well, but since it also stirs up the water, it's hard to get all the scum at one time. So, I'm trying to use it once a week. But, yes, it does eliminate some of the scum on the bottom."
1,Not so great,"I'm considering returning this item. Although it did suck up a little bit of waste, the way it stirred up the water and make it murky, plus added a lot of other water to the pond wasn't worth it. Atleast it didn't cost a fortune."
3,Should be renewed although I know they've killed it,"It's engaging even if somewhat far fetched.I'm a former submarine sailor and most people I know who served on submarines hate the show because the writers are completely clueless about submarine life and culture. For example, a submarine is a boat, not a ship, to submariners.I'm willing to let that pass because they could improve that over time. JAG was totally out in left field when it began, using Army lingo for much of it. Heck NCIS still gets that wrong using words like tour for a deployment."
1,"Great premiere, but now going downhill fast","Like most other reviews here I loved the premiere, but every episode since has just gotten worse.This last episode ""Another Fine Navy Day"" was the worst yet. Seemed to me it was more like a stalling tactic - that the writers didn't know where to take the show - so they just drugged everyone and we have to sit through 45 minutes of stupid hallucinations that simply annoyed me. I found myself fast forewarding through parts I was so disappointed.The writers had better get on the ball with the next episode or risk losing more and more viewers."
3,Lost all over again,often times it bordered on the unrealistic. the story wandered too much. The island chief was over the top for a minor war lord and way too many people came to the island.
4,"i say thee ""nay!""",i worked on subs and spent 20 years in the navy. this show does not deserve to be cancelled. it is well written and has multiple angles and plot twists. a show does not have to be 100 percent accurate to be entertaining and thought provoking. i'm just amazed at the people who get on that band wagon. what part about fiction don't they understand? mostly accurate will do for me. next people will want to see active duty personnel in the show. the cancellation of this show is an indicator for the decline of the american television industry.
5,Original and suspenseful,"Each week, I am on the edge of my seat the entire show. It is a mix of military and political maneuvering. When you think I have it figured out, they present another option I had considered and it blows me away how complicated the situation really would be (if it were real life)."
3,A little bit cheesy but overall pretty good,"A good story line well paced and worth watching. The only drawback is they seem to pick most actors in the secondary roles (and that is a large part of this show) based on looks vs talent. Yes, the pretty girl working for the defense contractor is nice to look at. Yes nice underwear scene, but just stick her picture on the screen for 15 seconds or something. Her playing a role and us believing it or even enjoying it, not so enjoyable. Many other examples as well are present. The story is good though and the fact that the MSM is actually putting out a show that questions our role in the world as it's strongest military power is an encouraging thing itself. The events are somewhat believable as they are presented to us and the show may turn out to have a great season."
1,"Decent series, horrible streaming experience","I think the series is decent and worth a watch. Some of the acting is quite good and the story line keeps you interested. I have purchased three from Amazon, but the feed for each was interrupted 4-5 times each and it took some time to resume where I had left off."
2,Show's getting a little constipated ...,"Uh ... the ""stuff"" is not moving along very fast .... I am getting a little bored at all these stalling tactics, get on with it."
5,awesome,"This show is great !! Acting is great, story line very compelling. Have to restrain from watch all episodes at once."
4,Interesting show,If you into drama with action this is a nice one with some twists and mystery. Though something in the story seem a little off from what military would do. Its fun to watch if you into military conspiracies and twists.
5,"Amazing. Fresh, and original.","I am really suprised after watching the first episode. I feel I am going to be hooked. I don't want to give away anything, but the acting is great, and the overall story seems like something I could really get into."
3,Great story line,My husband and I really have enjoyed the series. There are only two seasons and it ended abruptly... probably when they got cancelled.
2,So much hope for this one.... I am bummed out :(,"It is really difficult to make a military themed show. As a veteran you expect a certain look and feel when you watch a movie or show that is about people in the military. If you don't get that atmosphere right it just comes off as fake. The story concept is interesting, but acting and dialog leave it feeling a little unsophisticated."
4,Looks like a real winner,"I was surprised to find the Pilot for this series so enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of special effects and some action but not the depth of storyline that was developed.After wathcing the free Pilot on Amazon I immediately scheduled it to record every episode on my dvr. This series is a great combination of action, intrigue and suspense. It is a well developed story and keeps me coming back for the next episode. Both my wife and i are enjoying the show."
5,Keeping my fingers crossed and TV tuned!,"This show is one of my FAVES this season! I love Andre Braugher (Get on the Bus, Glory, Homicide: Life on the Street, Men of a Certain Age, etc.), anyway, so I'm always holding out hope for another opportunity to watch him in action. The Last Resort doesn't disappoint. Given the circumstances of the plot, I'm curious to see how the writers will keep the conflict and excitement going for future seasons. I'm still keeping my fingers crossed that other viewers will check in and get hooked. Just say YES!"
5,BLAST RESORT,"Last Resort is technically and tactically entertaining and makes you think about ""what if,"" while considering the grass roots of our political system and perhaps it's future."
2,Unaware,"I didn't,t realize I bought it. If I did it was quite awhile agoI no I had it in my wish list. So in other words. I haven't watched. It"
4,It was okay.,"This is not one of the most remarkable books I've ever read but it wasn't bad either. I was pretty surprised, though, that Jessica can run so fast when I don't recall it being mentioned in Sweet Valley Twins."
4,Need for change,"I am the author of this book. It was written after the Toronto Blessing cult devastated thousands of churches worldwide and ruined many Christian lives. The cult continues as the charismatic movement, and so the book was needed. I have rated it as four stars because though it is unique, it needs even more work done to it. Charismatics claim many new members...but they fail to admit to the many more who leave them! New members are easy to get - but harder to keep from leaving, or from being kicked out. Many leave because they know their churches are false, or are being unscriptural. It is about time Christians stood up for the truth and stopped allowing fake pastors and movements from ruining lives."
1,Amateur,"Don't waste your money on this...there a couple of good bands and couple decent tracks on this collection, but pretty terrible overall. There is no flow at all and the musical styles are all over the spectrum, whatever theme they were going for they didn't achieve with this release."
2,2 Out Of 3 Ain't Bad,"I purchased this DVD at Wal-Mart for $5 dollars -- not a bad price for 3 movies.However, to clarify, THE TED BUNDY STORY is the only ""movie"" in the set. The other features are a 2-hour documentary on the Manson Family murders (VERY detailed and very entertaining), as well as a 2-hour segment of the A&E; series, THE PROSECUTERS titled THE BONEYARD, which was nothing more than re-enactments of the actual case. I found this 3rd feature to be the least entertaining and most cumbersome to watch.But overall, not bad for a $5 price tag."
2,Little pom pom,"My first impression of this lure is it made of the same material as a Pom Pom. It also looks like one. I was impressed by the nosie maker and thought initially it would do well.After trolling the lure for roughly an hour, we pulled it in to take a look and noticed almost all of the plastic material had come off. I trolled it a little more with no hits. Sure it could have been the day, but I at least expect the lure to withstand a normal trolling session. Should be a $7 lure max!"
3,Where is the DVD/CD-RW Combo and the TouchPad?,"I would have bought this laptop the first time I saw it, except that it does not have a DVD/CD-RW combo. I just didn't want to pay extra for a separate CD-RW drive.Another big minus is that it does not have a touch-pad, which over the long run doesn't put strain on your finger as a pointing-stick does.Oh well, I hope Toshiba starts putting touchpads on its upper-end notebooks in the near future."
2,Very good... until it stopped working,"This was a nice addition to my key chain. Yes, the thermometer was about 5-10 degrees off, but I learned how to deal with that. However, the compass stopped working after about 3 months. No matter which direction you turn, the needle always points north of you, not north of the earth. Not cool."
3,Way more useful than expected,"Temperature is great to adjust heaters, compass saves gas around town. Keyring a major plus. My lifetime partner.Update- its a divorce as the thermometerstopped working. For the price its ok. Maybe there is a fix as the mercury kind of split in 2 additional parts and are stuck at the higher temperatures. Mercury is very cohesive so maybe it just needs to touch the rest.???."
2,Very poor reception,"Good battery life, nice caller ID features, but I've had such difficulty with the reception I couldn't possibly reccommend this phone. As some the other reviews have mentioned, I get constant static almost everywhere in my home. Maybe you'll have better luck in your home, but beware."
3,Great book but don't read in a day,Theological points dealing with repentance were good but repetitive. Interesting to see his prediction on how the modern era would fall.
2,BETTER THAN FLOWERS,"GREAT ADDITION TO YARD FOR COLORING THINGS UP. IF WIND IS OVER 30 MPH, TAKE THEM IN OR GO LOOKING FOR THEM LATER. I BOUGHT 10 OF THEM AND THEY ALL CAME IN A SEPERATE BOX SO POSTAGE COST MORE THAN WIND WHEELS. THEY WOULDN'T COMBINE SHIPMENT AND 30 OF THEM WOULD OF FIT IN ONE BOX. THE WHEELS ON SOME ARE WOOBBELY AND YOU NEED TO PUT THE SMALL WHEEL IN THE BETWEEN THE 2 LARGER ONES SO THEY DON'T HIT TOGETHER."
5,Norpro Stainless Steel Mozzarella Slicer,"(02/22/2012 Update). I purchased and received a new Norpro Stainless Steel Mozzarella Slicer today (again, from Amazon, having previously returned my first unit), This second unit arrived in excellent condition, and works just fine --- therefore, I have upgraded my previous one-star rating on Jan 07 2012, to a full 5-Stars Rating on today 02/22/2012."
3,haven't bought it...why???,because the WRONG dimensions are on listed for the item. How can they be the same as the smaller sleeve?!?!?! It would be nice if you could let amazon know but apparenlty they do not have contact info like a normal compnay at the bottom of the page. Not even for the webmaster. Nice.
1,"Explain how an Interior Size: 15.4 x 10.2 x 1.8 (W x H x D) will fit a 17"" SCREEN","Nah it ain't THAT stretchy. I wish I would have seen these reviews before I bought this!! I thought a 17"" screen would need 17"" of space. Not in the land of Body Glove, you only need 15.4"" right?? NOPE! It ain't a workin!! Sending mine back.It's too big for my 15"" screen too!"
4,Basic and Does the Job,"I bought this mainly so I could carry my laptop to and from class, and generally just as a way to protect it from getting scratched or getting things lodged into USB/Ethernet plugs.The case is really basic. Although it's for 17"" notebooks it really fits 15.4"" notebooks, it is just slightly (about 1-2cm extra) larger than a snug fit. Some reviewers complained about the logo on the front of the case ruining their laptops but it looks pretty solid to me. Fellowes may have changed the design to make it more secure and prevent future damages.I bought this on Amazon when it was only ten bucks, which was a real bargain. I don't know if I would buy it at the price it is currently listed (about five bucks more).EDIT: I guess I should mention that I have a 15.4"" Macbook Pro, which is a widescreen laptop."
3,Rusqred,"Looks and feels good, but unfortunately, it does not fit most 17"" and even some 15.4"" laptops on the market today. I took mine to the local Best Buy to see how many 17"" laptops could fit in it and we only found one. We even found one of the 15.4"" laptops that didn't fit.Fellowes/Body Glove should go back to the manufacturers and get the current measurements for the laptops that are on the market today and reclassify this one as a 15.4"" model."
1,HP laptop does not fit,"I ordered this sleeve after carefully measuring my hp laptop and realizing that I needed a sleeve larger than the 15 inch one. When the 17 inch sleeve came, it was wide enough but too short and would not zip shut. The enclosed paperwork did give me a return address but no information about the purchase price. I mailed the sleeve back but have heard nothing from the sender and received no refund."
2,not the right size,this cover doen's tfit a 17 inch computer. it is too small. it is of nice quality for smaller computers i do recommend however not for 15-17 in monitor laptops
3,Too small,"Got the 17"" for my Dell 6400 (15"") just to be safe. But even this is too small for the laptop - the other dimension is 12"" which is not enough."
3,"Won't fit all 17"" LapTops","Great quality & product BUT... While the width was fine, it is not deep enough to cover the HP Pavillion 9000 series laptops. This is the perfect sleeve for additional protection from dust, shock, etc. for your laptop. I needed it so I could carry my laptop in my leather briefcase that has no padding and was not designed for laptops. It would have been perfect if it had only been deeper. It was shallow by about 3-4 inches. Just Damn. If anyone knows of a Neoprene sleeve that will fit the HP-9000 series 17"" post a note."
3,"This barely fits my 15.4"" notebook","I bought this disregarding the reviews because my laptop is 15.4"", but this barely fits even that. It also doesn't look or feel as if it offers much protection. If I were to do this over again, I would've splurged on the nicer $30.00 case. I gave it 3 stars because I knew it would be small, with no extra pockets or even a shoulder strap, and I went ahead with the purchase. Anyhoo,I hope someone learns from my mistake."
2,"Body Glove 17"" Neoprene Notebook Sleeve","It's nice but it doesn't fit a 17"" notebook so I gave it to a friend who had a 15"" notebook and it fit perfectly and she loves it."
2,"Doesn't fit 17"" widescreen","I ordered it after I bought notebook, but doesn't fit my widescreen notebook. I returned it."
1,"Not For 17"" Notebooks","This turned out to be of no use to me. It doesn't come close to accommodating my 17"" widescreen Toshiba notebook pc."
3,Does not Fit HP dv9035nr Laptop!!,"I did not have any delays in the shipping. It was on time but disappointed that it did not fit the new HP Pavillion Notebooks dv9035nr. The Laptop was too long to insert into the sleeve. I was looking forward to using this as additional padding for my Targus laptop back pack. Now I have to search somewhere else to find the right one for my laptop. They have to be specific now when they are saying it will fit a 17inch laptop, because it does not fit all them."
3,Measure your computer first.,"This is a nice product, but my 17"" laptop does not fit. Should learn to read reviews before I buy."
1,Misrepresentation,"Although it is called a 17"" notebook sleeve, it did not fit my laptop.I bought it online for my new DELL Inspiron 940017 "" laptop, however the 17"" Notebook Sleeve is shorter by over an inch both in length and width dimensions.The Online Company ANT did not include in their product description the dimensions and therefore led you to believe it will fit all 17"" portable computers which is obviously not the case!!!They offered me to return it at my expense and additionally charge me a ""restocking fee"" even though they mislead me."
3,"17"" Sleeve","This sleeve was a bit too snug for my 17"" HP Laptop. In fact it has a tear at one corner."
3,"well made, didn't fit","I like fellows products in general. Have looked for a while for a good 17"" sleeve. This one looks like what I wanted & is definitely well made. However, It is too small from top to bottom...won't zip up. Perhaps my machine is outsized for a 17""...it is an emachine..."
3,Better than nothing...,"Not a lot of protection by itself - good for additional protection inside your laptop case, and priced accordingly."
4,Another great album by The Kry!,"'What About Now' is another inspiring album from The Kry that does not compromise, in any way, about its message of the cross but at the same time is up among any band that plays today, secular or Christian. The music and the lyrics are awesome and I believe people from all walks of life will identify with it. This album includes the hits 'Paradise', 'Over and Over again', and 'Jason'. There's a remix of the alltime favorite 'By the Rivers of Babylon' too. So if you're looking for some good music get to the nearest store and grab it as I highly recommend this album."
3,Odd but compulsively readable,"Richardson takes as his starting point a guy, Josh, he knew who hung out in Soho in the 50s and met all the famous painters, writers, deadbeats and drunks. The book is partly the author's search for Josh, meeting his old friends, visiting his old haunts and being haunted by old visitors, and partly a novelisation of Josh's life. The novelised bits are surprisingly good, and the ""real"" bits are excellent but a bit weird. We're told that old friends made revelations which we'll come back to later - this never happens. The author's life begins to follow the Soho model - or is it all made up? Was he ever a property journalist with a mouse-infested country cottage and a crush on a girl called Louise? Is there really anyone called ""Nigel Richardson""? It's a funny and well-written take on the ""look at me I'm a writer writing"" genre."
4,Great Reference Book,"I ordered this book as an aid in helping me with my fledgling free-lance costume design business. I found it to be extremely inspirational and informative. I felt like was on the production team of this fabulous musical, learning all the tricks of the trade. I'm very happy to add this book to my collection of art and fashion design books. The pictures are wonderful!"
5,My all time favorite Arabesque Book,"This romance novel makes me feel feel so good inside, I read this novel over and over and over."
4,Good reference,"With the movie Gladiator now out I was very pleased to find acopy of this book ............ Mr. Grant is a superb Roman historian, but this book is under 200 pages and is more of a handbook than anything else, but it's a very good handbook. Full of pictures, illustrations and a very readable text Mr. Grant gives the reader a look into the life of the Gladiators and the society which loved to watch them fight and die. For either the general reader or the more involved Roman history buff this book is worth the money."
3,A brief description of the Gladiator profession in Rome.,"Michael Grant has written some wonderful books about the ancient world. Although this book is informative and very readable, the depth of this book is not great. It is mostly a summary of the life of the gladiator, and how these brutal games evolved. Many pictures in this 128 page book. If the reader is looking for something more substanial, they best look elsewhere. For those looking for a brief explanation, this is the book."
3,inconsistency of product,"First time I ordered this product it was an excellent purchase! But the second time I ordered the same product it came out to be different? The first time one side said ""Italy"" and the other side said ""Italia"" the next time I went to purchase more, both sides just said Italy and they weren't in as good as condition as the first one.. I wish I could have the same expectation during the second buy, but you get what you pay for I guess."
2,An unconvincing claim of a code within the bible.,"Drosnin has made an astounding claim and if indeed there is a bible code it would have a profound effect on my religious beliefs.The author claims that the code ""has been confirmed by world famous mathematicians at Harvard,Yale,and Hebrew University,that the code has been replicated by a senior code-breaker at the department of defense and that it has passed three levels of secular peer review at a leading U.S. math journal.""Do all of the individuals above in fact,verify the existance of a bible code?"
3,A interesting book,"I've read the book,and i'm shocked by what i discovered in it,although i'm not much of a believer,the book does raise some very interesting points to ponder"
1,Insulting,"I bought this book when the issue started becoming a hot topic just to see what the Bible Code was supposed to be. I was unimpressed then and less impressed now. The author uses Biblical Hebrew to try and prdict the future, and well, because the text did not have vowels, he can make it say just about anything. The only reason to buy this book is for a good laugh, otherwise, don't insult yourself."
1,Absolute fluff,"Drosnin fervently believes in the ""Mathematical improbability"" of the Bible code; in fact he uses the eccentricities of the Hebrew language to his advantage. The Hebrew language contains vowels only when punctuation is used; by eliminating punctuation and therefore all vowels, Drosnin increases his chances of finding random words. Also, there are many times in Hebrew where words can be shortened or letters ommitted. Absolute fluff and a waste of time!"
3,Ignorance is bliss,"Drosnin's account of Rips research was not as scientific as one would like, but he does provide a fair introduction to the codes in the Torah. The predictions he found were flawed and he certainly seemed to bring out the polarized side of this issue. This is not a book to base your belief (or disbelief) on, however it provides a simplistic view of the ancient belief that God provided man with sacred information in the form of the Torah. For those who are seeking knowledge, it will inspire you to continue researching. For those who don't wish to think beyond Happy Hour, it will give you more insults to hurl at that pesky religious community. All around good fun for everybody."
1,how easily we are deceived...,"You can look at the stars in the sky and come up with numerous ""codes"". You can look at grains of sand on a beach and come up with numerous ""codes"". You can look at blades of grass in a field and come up with numerous ""codes"". You can look at the text of the ""Bible"" and come up with the ""Bible Code"". You can look at ""War and Peace"" and probably come with an alternative ""Bible Code"", or even it's opposite. Such occurrences of ""codes"" are inevitable, given a minimum set of criteria - in this case long passages of text. The ""Bible Code"" is a manifestation of this, nothing more. It's alarming that so many people believe it."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Statistical probability, plus hindsight = randomness that appears as meaningful pattern. Absolute rubbish; a big waste time and money."
1,He Believes Now,"I watched The Bible Code I and II tonight on cable. (Sunday March 20, 2005). Drosnin has changed his mind and now states he does believe in God. I guess his lack of faith expressed on NPR hurt book sales.Personally, I can take it or leave it. I would wait till I could get a good used book at less than half-price though."
4,"good book, but not good/detailed enough (good marketing too)","This book is well-written, organized, and very easy to understand. Aside from its good marketing. This is a good book for people (especially for those who don't believe in the Bible) who are just begin to explore this subject. The author focused on more things interests himself and the common people but didn't mention much about the bibilical things which the Bible believers might want to know about. It leaves me unfilled because there wasn't enough details but led to further interest in this subject. This books is a good start, but you'll need to buy another book on this subject for further understanding and more details."
1,A waste of time and money,"Does the Bible contain secret codes that only a computer can find and translate? After reading this book I would have to say no. The author gives many examples in the Bible and tries to relate the translations to the modern world. However, the author does a very poor job in arguing his point throughout the novel. The argument is so poor that it makes me wonder if the novel was just a scam to get money from Christians who were paying close attention to the year 2000. I would recommend spending your money on another novel."
1,yea right,"this book is a total complete waste of time, the author makes it so hard to belive that he didn't make this crap up. He sounds like a crazy person doing everything possible to back up his ideas. its so stupid, thats its hilarious."
2,I'd prefer to be surprised,"This book evoked vivid imagery for me. Unfortunately, the image was of the salesman at an electronics superstore using all the persuasiveness he could muster to convince me that a 3 year extended warranty was essential for my new DVD player.Simply stated, the matrixes required to identify encrypted code in the text of the Hebrew versions of the bible were just a little to convenient for me. The theoretical basis seemed to be continue to search random passages until you hit a set of symbols that could be interpreted as a predicted event. I saw too much exhortation and far too little definitive, and applicable empirical evidence.And, to seal the deal, although the book is a breeze to read, it is extremely repetitious and fundamentally boring."
1,Science fiction at it's best!,"I knew I was in trouble when the author wrote in the forward, ""I do not believe in God."" Then what's he doing writing a book about the Bible?I know I was in even more trouble when he started showing things in the Bible but not putting a reference, i.e. John 3:16, Gen. 3:15, etc. etc. Anybody can write a code in Hebrew and make it say anything they want.Finally, I knew I was reading a poor attempt at science fiction when the authos said God is an alien.Wasted my money on this one. Please do NOT buy!"
2,Figures prove ANYTHING - but don't make it true,"I found this book too abstruse to be convincing. If figures can be used to prove anything, then I think it follows that a computer can find a hidden code in the Bible. A far more compelling biblical epic has to be ""THE Autobiography of Jesus....."" by Richard G. Patton in which the facts we CAN accept, are presented in an open and less 'theatric' manner to create a FAR more convincing whole. If you are going to take accepted knowledge and turn it on its head, you will need the skill of a great writer like Patton. The idea of the BIble Code is sound, but the delivery lacks conviction"
1,Economical with the truth,"Drosnin neglects to mention that the same kind of coincidental crossings can be found in any sufficiently long text, even in English (where there is much less room for interpretation/imagination than in Hebrew). Also, Drosnin should have paid some attention during high school math, perhaps he would have learnt something about statistics."
2,Sacriligious,"Michael Drosnin has insulted the Bible by turning it into one of those puzzle books where you try to find the hidden words along diagonals, rows and columns. He gets an A+ for cleverness, a B for writing ability and an F- for content. The only book that does a good job of combining religion and science is The Bible According to Einstein."
3,Go to the library...,"This was an interesting book, but was less than expected. It does not deserve a TEN as some people have put. My recommendation would be to go to the library and read it...but don't waste your money on it!I agree that by ""munipulating"" text, you can find anything in a book or document that is as long as the Bible if you try hard enough."
2,"Figures can prove ANYTHING, but doesn't make it true","I found this book too abstruse to be convincing. If figures can be used to prove anything, then I think it follows that a computer can find a hidden code in the Bible. A far more compelling biblical epic has to be ""THE Autobiography of Jesus....."" by Richard G. Patton in which the facts we CAN accept, are presented in an open and less 'theatric' manner to create a FAR more convincing whole. If you are going to take accepted knowledge and turn it on its head, you will need the skill of a great writer like Patton. The idea of the BIble Code is sound, but the delivery lacks conviction."
4,very interesting,"Isn't it amazing that people writing theirreviews either love it or hate it. I bought thebook and read it through and found it very interesting. I am amazed that there is no mentionmade however, of the author's search of Jesus Christ. (I mean - look for Shakespeare, but notJesus??) If any of you out there who have bought the program would like to let me know I would appreciate an e-mail message. I might add that I am a believer of Jesus and in no way can a book like this prove or disprove what I believe in, just that same as one's faith cannot be built upon a shroud."
3,"Interesting Ideas, Bad Writing","The author's selection subject matter is inspired, but his writing abilities suggest keeping the day job. Given a willingness to slog through the morass of minutia the author felt compelled to include, several provocative ideas emerge. The author seems to feel that computers were used to produce holy scripture, and that computers are needed to thoroughly understand it. This seems to be an original concept, and it raises the question of whether some alien intelligience played a role in the production of spiritual tomes. The most intriguing thing about the decrypted 'prophesies' is their resemblance to an online conversation between widely separated entities. I have not bothered to pursue the analysis necessary to find out whether the decryption techniques employed by the author are genuine, so I viewed the material in this book quite skeptically, but I did find some interesting things in it"
1,A Few Questions for the Reader to Ponder,"What about the validity of the wealth of text-critical information located in the Masoritic text of the Hebrew Scriptures and in any of our Greek texts of both the New Testament and the LXX?How does this book help one to grow in the faith?Does not the fact that there have been human copyist errors over the centuries in the transmission of our present texts undermine the accuracy of Drosnin's algorithms?Is not the Bible to be read with faith and the presence of the Holy Spirit rather than the wisdom of people, as, by the way, ""The foolishness of God is wiser than men...""(I Cor. 1:25)?"
1,The Bible Code is absolute nonsense.,"Any person who believes this nonsense is both mathematically illiterate and credulous to the point of dysfunction. A search algorithm can be designed and applied to any body of words to get whatever result one wishes. In fact, this has been done to War and Peace. I recommend purchasing War and Peace over The Bible Code. War and Peace is great literature and may actually teach you something. Save your money on this one."
4,Drosnin delivers and informative yet redundant synopsis....,"I read this book mostly out of a fascination of the possibility that the code could in fact exist. I enjoyed reading it, although it seemed like Drosnin spent more time reiterating his prediction of the Rabin assassination whenever he felt his arguement was in jeopardy. This code could be used not to predict apocalyptic vision,but rather to focus on positive aspects of our past...and our future. Drosnin spent most of the book giving redundant examples and fear-based visions of the future. This is not the only future as Drosnin himself admitted...so why all this focus on doom and gloom?"
2,Interesting But Disingenuous,"It's an interesting read, and you'll be done with it in about 2 days (lots of graphs).To the open minded, you will see beyond the simple fact that all texts will come up with ELS, but that the Torah has incidents of ELS that are hard to explain via simple statistics.The problem I have with this book is that the author fails to convey clearly that his major source of the ELS incidents disagrees with his conclusions (although he does to an extent, he does not explain thoroughly). A simple web search will find his source contends that he is completely wrong in his conclusions.A great bathroom book. Neat for trivial knowledge. Can't buy the future prediction feature though..."
5,"Bible Code can be understood if you know ""The Unified Theory","The Bible Codes and the ""Fifth Dimension"" can be understood if one knows the solution to Albert Einstein's ""The Unified Theory.""You might like to view this web site:http://www.unified-theory.com"
3,nice story told with the wrong attitude and banal conclusion,"I think that the lack of general understanding of Torah, judaism and the world itself does not allowed the author to take the right approach to this amaizing findings.The descriptive part of the book, when he explaines the Rips' experiments and the history of codes is very good. It's also very interesting to hear the opinions of professional people. Unfortunately author's own opinion and thoughts are not that valuable. He often repeats facts with ""new"" detailes and tries to philisophize on the basis of ""words matching"".I believe all his ""experiments"" and future predictions are silly.It's clear even to the author that everything (literally!) is coded. Because of that all his ""codes"" may really means that ""M.Drosnin will try to make a book of this"". And I am afraid that its not that important for the mankind.His apocaliptic ideas are really a millenium feaver symptoms.So try to read the book critically. But take valuable facts from it."
1,A Nice Little Math Trick,"Any validity which Drosnin seems to have is nothing but math tricks. The book is 200 pages of pure, no nonsense fluff. The only reason Drosnin can get dates for the events in the book is because Hebrew uses letters to also stand for numerals - an advantage English does not have. And yet other important world events for found in ""Moby Dick"" using the same (DLS) method. But I'm sure alot of folks will be terrified and everybody will make lots of money on this garbage. Congradulations."
1,A waste of time and money.,"I came away very disappointed after reading this book. Christians reading this book will not find any insight leading to a deeper relationship with God and Jesus is never mentioned. The author admits he is a non-believer and attributes the code to a ""higher intelligence"" other than God (ET's perhaps?) The author repeatedly doubts the reliability of the code all through the book and finally vows to ""get out of the fortune-telling business."" (A recent study which used the ELS system Drosnin writes about and the novel, ""Moby Dick"", was able to find the death of Princess Diana. Also a group of some 50 world-class mathematicians signed a letter disclaiming the validity of the ELS code.) All in all, a very disappointing read. It promises much, delivers very little. Remember ""Chairots of the Gods"" several years ago? Save your money."
1,This book has been debunked a multitude of times...,... and only those that are grasping at straws in an attempt to bolster their flagging Christian faith will enjoy it.
1,How Stupid Can People Get?,"This waste of perfectly good trees is a crock. Drosnin arrogantly challenged someone to disprove his thesis by finding assassinations in the text of Moby Dick. Well, a mathemetician did just that. Just do a web search for assassinations foretold in moby dick, and see for yourself."
2,Too much repetition,The author goes over the same material over and over and over. This book could have been condensed to 50 pages and it would still have had repetition.I stopped at page 108 after becoming tired of re-reading the same stories reworded.As for the code itself. It's very intriguing.
1,Give Me Something To Believe In,"""I'm a total skeptic,"" Drosnin states near the end of The Bible Code. But if anything, he seems in need of a healthy dose of skepticism. He's often guilty of forcing the puzzle to make it fit. In fact, Drosnin--a self-proclaimed atheist--appears to be formulating his own secular religion.It's often been noted that our beliefs tend to reflect our technology. Where once we believed in angels, we now believe in aliens. Where we once believed in divinely-inspired scriptures, now Drosnin gives us the Bible code, prophesies penned by helpful extraterrestrials, accessible only by computer. Not to put too fine a point on it: the ""code"" is pseudo-intellectual twaddle. Even an amatuer statistician could discover that, and some have, proving that you can find the same sort of ""predictions"" in any book you care to pick up.If you must read this book I urge you to read some of the criticism of it, too, since its basic premise is all too easily dismissed."
2,"Interesting, but not unique","The same methods and principles used in the Bible to predict the future have also been repeated successfully in the book Moby Dick, which basically disproves the central message of The Bible Code. Look it up on the internet (the Moby Dick experiment)."
2,"Sure, why not, go ahead and read it","As the ""thumb"" on the scrollbar of my Netscape window grows smaller and smaller, I realize this is a book which has aroused some emotions. However, after reading the original paper, the work by Harold Gans and Brendan McKay, and others, I can only come to one conclusion: Drosnin's aim was to portray himself as the central figure in a timeless drama, nothing more. You'll have to look elsewhere for reasoned debate.Are the Codes true? I have no idea. But the truth lies somewhere between the agenda of mainstream science (who think truth is what they prove is true), and the agenda of religious zealots (who think truth is what they say is true). The book by Satinover is a better, more reasoned introduction.I give it a three."
1,Offensive abuse of statistics,"As a mathematician and cryptographer I find the methods used simplistic and unconvicing. With the great liberties taken you could equally ""show"" many other predictions of events in the past.People would be better off practicing what is preached in the Bible, than looking for secret codes.Like McCarthism, if you look hard enough for something, you can generally find vague allusions to anything. I wonder how many sexually explicit messages might be found with the same technique.Let Faith be based upon faith in the words of the Bible, not in ""secret codes.""If you want true stories about secret codes, I highly recommend David Kahn's _The Codebreakers; The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet_ (2nd ed 1996). In fact if I recall correctly, there is even mention of others looking for secret codes in reglious texts."
1,tabloid-esque,"I was disappointed in the quality of writing from an author with a journalistic reputation. I find it hard to believe he writes for such an intellectual paper as the Wall Street Journal. His ""persuasive arguments"" sounded similar to those one can read in the tabloids at your local grocery store checkout line. They had the same emotional, non-intellectual appeal. The writing was entirely too much repetitive, too. The diagrams were worthless, put there to appear convincing, while not actually explaining anything. The scientific paper printed in the appendix was the only worthwhile part to the entire book. The only thing I was convinced of was that the quality of writing was poor, and the persuasion lacking."
2,As troubling as the Book of Revelations,"Could the ancient scriptures contain messages for modern man that computers can only now decode?The author believes its possible -- and finds hidden reference to past historic events and future catastrophies such as earthquakes and nuclear wars. Each one has a year attached to it, and the past events were right on the money. These are not vague, Nostradamous-like puzzles that could have various interpretations, but brief, to-the-point, clearly defined phrases that include actual names.While Drosnin is not religious, he examines the evidence in a dispassionate, scientific manner and describes his efforts to warn Middle Eastern leaders of upcoming dangers.Can we ward off these calamities or is our fate already sealed? I was intrigued, and a bit shaken, by this fascinating subject."
1,Snake Oil & Tonic Water,"These are two things that have a lot in common with the suppositions in this book. There's one GIANT premise at work here, and a false one I might add. And that is that the ancient Hebrews were a chosen people by the designing creator and that these selected members of his creation were asked to write down his thoughts. (An outstanding tribal, survival scheme)Reams and reams of archeological evidence, manuscript evidence, historical evidence, etc., fail to support that supposition in any small way. Quite the contrary, in fact.Needless to say, then, that the concept of a hidden mathematical code, placed there by our creator, hiding within ancient Hebrew manuscripts which, incidentally, borrowed greatly from the preexisting religeous texts in their region, is without basis in fact.Dream on, a fantasy will work for you as well as the bible code."
3,An interesting case of random sequencing in society,"Michael Drosnin's THE BIBLE CODE illustrates well a real-life application of a mathematical idea which is at once simple and complex. The central notion presented is that the Torah (Old Testament) is riddled with predictions of the future encoded as equidistant letter sequences. Approximately 100 examples of this are given in the book.Unfortunately, the mathematical problem upon which the book depends is given short shrift. Drosnin quotes a Harvard mathematician, an NSA cryptanalyst, among others, who seem to think that the phenomenon observed is unique and inexplicable. But this is clearly wrong. The same phenomenon *can* and has been observed in other works, such as Melville's MOBY DICK. The more words you string together, the greater the likelihood of finding words that match or describe events.The book works well as non-fiction/fiction, is easy to read and quite compelling in it's way."
3,could be condensed by not being redundant,"I'm sure the author wanted to get his point across,however the mention of Rabin was too overstated. He could have said what he wanted to in half the time.I was dissapointed in the fact, that I was unable to locate the author in a people search. Do you have any idea how I may be able to correspond with Mr. Drosnin?"
2,Breaking the code?,"...The book is largely discredited now, but pops up now and again by people who find it on the remainder table and are mesmerised--the same kind of people who buy astrology charts and Nostradamus prophecies. I'm not saying there is nothing here. I'm not saying, either, that astrology is meaningless (I check my horoscope every day for some reason) or that Nostradamus didn't have a gift--but I think the Bible Code is, in fact, a human invention, yet one more way for humans to get excited over a remarkable text, not realising the mathematical principles which are more to the point in this `amazing discovery'.Read it with skepticism."
2,not too bad...a good read,"I was given this book by a friend and was quite intrigued after reading it. It was only after, when I sat down and really thought about it, that I began to realize that finding any word or phrase is too great, no matter what text you are reading from.Actually, Dr. Eliyahu Rips, one of the focal points of the book, made a public statement, noting that future predictions of global events is statistically impossible. ... Don't take my word for it, just look at the other criticisms of this book. Read David Haggith's review titled ""Absolute Crock"". He gives a fair assessment of why the book should not be taken literally. If you are a believer, read a few of the online reports done by some high-ranking mathematicians. It is very interesting..."
3,I can predict the Future... after it happens,"Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book based off the subject matter and the idea behind the Bible Code. There was a tremendous amount of work that went in to the development of the idea software and correlations. I just kept getting the feeling that we are a day late on everything we look at in the bible code. I actually think that is more interesting, almost as if the text itself can grow to fit what ever happens even though we have the free will to change possible futures. It is a short read and is interesting, I think the author can get a little dramatic and preachy into changing the future."
3,"Good starting on the Bible Code, but shallow and repetitive","This book opened up a new field at my mind about the Bible and its author (God). I found it fascinating and that encouraged me to find out more. To my surprise, there is even more about this theme than it is written in this book. Rather than simplistic matrixes (as shown in this book), there are works that comprise matrixes that consist on many more words. The author rounds and rounds the topic many times as if his main goal were to convince the reader; sometimes it's plainly boring. If you want broad information on the Bible Code, buy another book. But if you want to know just what is the Bible Code and how it was discovered, then this book will do well."
5,Proof from the Hard Sciences,"As predicted by the Corinthians the words of God are bound to fall on deaf ears. Without knowing it, these skeptics are fulfilling the words of God. And don't be skeptical of the claims in this book - the people at Harvard and Yale weren't."
2,An important subject dealt in a sensationalistic way,"This book is sensationalistic and highly misleading. The codes in the Bible is a phenomenon that has intrigued mathematicians and statisticians for a long time. The debate continues because the implications are of so much importance to all of us and yet are so difficult to believe. However, the structure of the codes is far more subtle and difficult to understand than the author implies. His book is simplistic and meant to feed the public's thirst for drama by implying that the codes can be used to forecast the future and thereby does a disservice to a subject that deserves our attention. For a far better book which takes a more serious look at the matter, please read instead ""Cracking the Bible Code""."
4,I thought it was a fairly good book(with some reservations).,"I thought it was a fairly good and thought- provoking book with lots of interesting info. However, Drosnin seems to assume that the reader has a working knowledge of Hebrew. Also, Drosnin seems overly and unjustifiably focused on using the code in order to predict the future. These tendencies make an other- wise excelent book that helps one see what a magnificent book the Bible truly is into fodder for sensationalistic elements in society. Those readers who do not have a good knowledge of the Bible, the Hebrew language, and computers could easily be overwhelmed by this book and misunderstand the Bible. The Bible is hard enough to understand without factoring in any codes. Otherwise, it is an excelent book for those willing to do their homework.norton"
2,"an interesting read for a novice, but no great enlightenment","Although I found some of historical predictions facinating, on balance this was not a very good book.The author also tried his hand at predicting the future, but he fell flat because he did not know what questions to ask. For the curious I thought the book was okay."
3,I'm reading it. Surprising. Chicken skinning. But...,I have recommended it to other people and it always causes the same effect. After the great shock it gaves the reader the remaining sensation is that it is a bit difficult to test it and at the end you stay with the thought that it's a matter of faith ( personally each one would decide if it's true or not).
3,Scholarly work ... on an intriguing premise!,"I found Mr. Drosnin's writing to be both intriguing and redundant. What amazes me more than his prose is the furor that it seems to have provoked. It seems ironic to me that even people who profess belief in the ""divine authorship"" of the Bible miss much of its central teaching ... that being that the future is of your own creation. I wonder if part of the encoded information includes the fact that so many people right now are attacking each other for differences in belief about the accuracy and ""definitive"" conclusions of this literary work - having little room for more expansive thinking. Mr. Drosnin ... we apologize for turning your work into justification for another religious ""war of the words"". Then again, if part of your intent was to get people talking ... your success reaches much higher than just being 3rd on the top seller list"
2,More Questions -- Where is more info available?,"This book was very interesting in its theory of a biblicalcode. However, the publisher should have left the codes for theappendix and edited the book for its repeats of thoughts and predictions. Although I would like to believe the bible code exists, it would help to have more information about predictions and past events that have happened. The author was very vague about what the next steps should be to determine what we can do to ensure that negative predictions do not come true or how to change the future for the benefit of mankind."
2,Statistics lacking,"As someone who reads and understands Hebrew, this modernexposition allied with Gematria (which is finding numericalrelationships between words (e.g. the hebrew word for life, Chai is 18, so 18 is a lucky number)) lacks plausability. Most of the examples utilize foreign words, such as English, transliterated into the hebrew. Because there is no fixed rule for such transliterations, these codes are complete garbage. By adjusting the Hebrew spelling to suit, one could find a code. The Rabin will be murdered code (the word Rezach means murder) is entirely in hebrew, but I didn't see any statistical or other mathematical treatments to demonstrate that this is not the result of chance. (Remember that the Torah is a very long work). I would be interested in reading the work of the mathmaticians who showed the codes using the names (I believe) of famous scholars."
2,Codes...,I wonder what would Drosnin find decoding the Enciclopedya Britannica using the same principles.If the result is similar to that in The Bible it would prove him right... or wrong!
1,This book is a total crock. Let me explain why.,"This book is a total crock, my reasoning being (1.) I am sick and tired of the author of books like these being non-religious and forced into believeing there is a God and there is a message in the Bible. (2.) In the book, words kept on suddenly popping up after something didn't come true, or wasn't different. (3.) The guy is a reporter supposedly. He is constantly flying out to the Middle East and finding messages in the Bible, so when is he ever reporting? (maybe he works for one of those tabloids...?). This is like the old 'When is Jesse Jackson ever at a church?' question. I gave this book 1 star, only because I can't go lower. Don't waste your money on it."
1,Careful!,"This is an extremely dangerous idea to adopt. Although well written, the whole idea that a computer can ""crack"" the mind of God is scary to say the least. Too much like TBN's Omega Code, which can very easily be disproven an a credible theory. Before you read this book, please read Christianity in Crisis by Hank Hanegraaff."
5,Fantastic,I thought this book would be just a pyramid type book wherebye the author just fits bits in to make a sensational account of human history The Bible Is nothing like i expected i cant see how anyone mathmatician to preist will fail to at least be moved if it isnt a code why havnt anyone come forward can you imagine the fame a mathmatition would get if they could prove it wrong. it left me feeling very moved and a bit scared the only thing is now we are going to get lots of books on this some will be good others ?????
5,Must reading for Jewish and Christian believers,"I found The Bible Code to be one of those life changing books for people of faith. You read books like this because you know the Bible is the Word of God or because you want proof that it is. After reading this book, you will have no doubt. No one other than God could have hidden such a complex code in the Bible thousands of years before the advent of computers. The million to one or greater odds that such codes could appear at random, and the astonishing predictions of the codes will convince you that God is the author of the Bible. Moreover, you will come away from this book having an even deeper awe of God. It is must reading for Jewish and Christian believers."
4,"He who has eyes will see, and ears will hear.","The Bible Code was not a fine or well polished piece of literature, but the subject matter was astounding! As I read along, I thought ""this couldn't be true""; to see so many historical items encoded in the Bible in a manner that could only be discovered by the use of a modern computer was absolutely amazing, and down-right frightening. I am a Christian, and although I believe that God communicates with all of his children in some way, it was hard for me to believe the code evidenced. Actually, I think everyone should read this book, and then spend some time thinking about it. God, the great ""I AM"", should we be face to face with him today, would probably make us feel a little like the rodent in Robert Burns' ""To A Mouse"". The Bible code points to a writer who knows the end from the beginning; who has perhaps written all of our reality, our existence, our world, life--which is far too much for most of us to comprehend."
1,The Bible crock,"Wouldn't be nice if there was some definitive proof that the Bible has some secret hidden knowledge within it? Man, that would be profound. Wouldn't it be equally awesome if in the book they say they tried using other books with the same code system they used for the Bible and no other book had any secret info? That would be far out man.Sadly none of the above is true. When you read it you get blown away by how profound it all is. Sadly, they have found another book that the code works for and it can pick up strange messages of a prophetic nature. Also, unless you look for a certain phrase nothing comes up. I think the whole thing is wishful thinking folks. If you want secret messages from the Torah, check out Kabalah."
3,Cracking The Code,"While Drosnin presents a useful idea interpreting the ""Bible Code"", his argument is difficult to follow. The main problem lies in the fact that if you don't speak Hebrew, then you can't really understand what is going on. Sure, Drosnin tells the readers the translations and illustrates his findings in the text, but you can't really verify anything. The idea itself is very interesting and probably worthy of further investigation, but until you add speaking Hebrew to your resume, it's pretty tough to know if he's really full of it or not."
2,Filled With False Promises,"The book is full of false promises of things that wont happen. It predicts that WWIII would have started in 1996 yet i see no war happening. Yet it is entertaining , thats the reason it got a 2."
1,Bible Codes don't measure up,"The so-called Bible Code, which uses Equidistant Letter Sequences, has been shown to be a natural phenomenon that exists in all pieces of literature. Other researchers have found derogatory remarks about God ""hidden"" in the Bible - were these inspired?"
4,I liked it. I went on to do my own searches.,"I was facinated by the book, and I couldn't believe it without trying it myself.I don't know much about Hebrew, but with some patience and effort I was able to do my own codes searches.I bought the codes program along with 'Bible Scholar'. The 'Bible Scholar' program gave me theEnglish Translation of the text I was searching.To do my own searches I bought a simple paperback English-Hebrewdictionary from a local bookstore.Yes, the Torah Codes program runs on DOS, but it does the job!I am very happy I boughtthe programs, and I spent a little time doing the searches, after a short while I got the system down.I want to note that ittakes patience. The codes are in Hebrew, and Hebrew has zero relationship to English. It is definately not like doing searchesin say Spanish, where at least they share a common alphabet. If you are adventurous, you liked the book, and you want to do searches: I wouldhighly recommend the products I use."
1,"This book isn't just fraud, it's blasphemy!","This book is a nothing but a complete hoax. All the same prophecys can be found in any other book of the same size! just read the ""moby dick code&quot. Why should any god-fearing christian believe this drivel?"
1,A#1 Falacy of the Year!,"The concept of a hidden code defys all of God's purpose and intention in communicating to humanity through the Bible. The heart of the written revelation is expressed in 2 Cor. 1:13 ""For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand."""
1,Silly Conjecture...,"How can you say that there is a bible code when it gets things wrong? Drosnin says Netanyahu would get assinated while still in office. the fact that ""Benny"" is still alive and kicking should be your first clue that this is not the word of God. What did Jeremiah say? The true test of a prophet is if his words come to pass. Drosnin's did not so there you have it!"
1,Assasinations foretold in MOBY DICK,"Hola, im just spreading the word about assasinations foretold in MOBY DICK : (...). See for yourself and I'm glad I did a little research before jumping in and buying this book."
1,Garbage,"There is always someone coming along with a book that says they have all the answers to every mystery in the Bible. That's why the have people who call themselves Branch Davidians and Heaven's Gate. When will we not become so gulliable to everyone who calls himself an ""expert"" and turns out Laughable stuff such as this. If you want to hear about secret codes. Go to your local supermarket and pick up the Globe. It Has a new story on the Bible every week and I'm more inclined to believe it"
4,Interesting...,"The evidence presented in the book appears to be credible and scientifically sound. The question I came away with is: If it's true, if Drosnin found as many secrets as he implies, where are the rest of them? Why aren't they in this book? Why aren't they in a follow-up book? Granted, there are some amazing things reported in this volume, but it feels like bait, like just a tantalizing first look. The author even admits as much in his introduction. So where's the rest of the story?"
1,Strong Delusions,"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 2 Thesslonians 2:10-12"
1,serving this to the nation is like serving dog doo.,How can you serve these lies to a confused and searching public? Bible codes can be anything you want them to be if it lines your pockets with green.
1,Dumber than dumb,Anyone who knows the first thing about the history of the Bible would know that this idea is stupid. It is possible to create any pattern you want from any book of the bible's size. But you need an IQ in single figures to believe this nonsense.
2,Methinks I've been had.,"Mr. Drosnin as a self proclaimed atheist certainly studies the Bible plenty and manages to extract the maximum hype on a few so called codes for a few events. The stastical probability is weakened to meaninglessness by his coy ""holding back"" and claims of ""delayed"" responses. Hindsight plays a huge role and is a reasonably exact science. Further we are asked to believe that aliens are responsible for the code. Give me a break! The sensationalism and emotional terrorism this guy practices is irresponsible and he offers nothing the reader can do. Any decent Christian, Jew or Moslem who knows their stuff can beat this guy any day. Save your money."
2,The challenge by M. Drosnin met,"M. Drosnin has challenged anybody to find a prediction of Prime Minister Rabin's assassination in Moby Dick. I assume that by Moby Dick he meant any book other than the Bible. I chose randomly a book titled (in Hebrew) Ziunim Ze Lo Hakol (which means Screwing Is Not Everything) by an Israeli novelist Dahn Ben-Amotz, published in Tel-Aviv in 1979 by Metziut Publishers. Without any computer program, and without rearranging the text, I very easily discovered in that book, on page 33, the following ELS, forming a chain of words with small skips, which read: Amir Will Kill Prime Minister Hero Rabin, all of this contained within just two paragarphs of about 600 characters. Hence, the challenge by M. Drosnin has been met. I am interested in a reply from M. Drosnin."
1,Skeptical,"I don't doubt the possibility that there is a code in the Bible about human history. I just don't think he's cracked it yet. The things he said would happen by the year 2000 have not happened. He gave no specific date for an economic collapse, either. Anyone could predict that. THis man also does not believe in God after so much ""evidence"". Why not? Because it's not true. The only thing this book does is cast more doubt on the Bible and people who believe it. Oh, well, I'll be a fool for God because I believe the Bible and Jesus Christ's virgin birth, crucified, death and resurrection."
1,Boring!!,"Read all three books and it gets too repetitive. Mr. Drosnin keeps emphasizing he is not a religious person and that he does not believe in God, I honestly feel sorry for him that after all his research and all the evidence he is still saying that he does not believe in God. It is very annoying how he keeps repeating the same thing over and over again. I hope he opens his eyes and his heart before is too late!!!!"
3,Fascinating but could be better,"The possibility that a code exists in the Bible intrigued me from the beginning. As a person who is not very religious at all, I viewed the work with great skepticism initially; however, the evidence contained therein is persuasive. Unfortunately, Drosnin is very repetitive and consequently does a poor job of expressing himself. There were many times that I just wanted him to ""move on."" Despite the relatively poor writing, I still give the work three stars, primarily because it kept me so interested I finished the entire book in one sitting."
2,Interesting,It's fascinating how something written thousands of years ago can predict events well into the future by changing the skip sequence. I wonder if any of the other religious texts also have hidden messages.
5,enlightening wake-up call to the world of christians,"I find Michaels appraoch to this fascinating and refreshing. Rather than coming from a theologian who has a tendencey to bog you down with their interpretation of scripture, he has no clue as to what the Bible says and therefore, no opinion! It is a must for every believer wanting the truth!"
1,i have not received the book,"This vendor is horrible. I purchased the book almost two months ago, and i have not received it. I am very upset and disappointed with this vendor. I definitely would not recommend ANYONE to purchase anything from this vendor."
1,"Total balderdash, and badly written to boot","Before buying this book, or making up your mind about its validity, run a search on ""Bible Code Skeptic"" and read some of the articles that come up--everything from statistical refutations of the original experiments done to the work of a group of scholars who found JFK's death ""foretold"" in Moby Dick. The fact of the matter is that in any text of such considerable length, ""significant"" results will be found to be ""encoded"". Any book whose ""review"" requires this many ""quotation marks"" can't be too good..."
2,"Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive","How many times do the predictions discovered have to be mentioned? How many times do I have to read about predictions of Rabin's assasination? By the middle of the book, I just kept thinking, ""you made your point, get on with it"". I won't pass judgement on the arguments presented in the book but I will on the writing and the writing stinks."
3,"Interesting, but there is little proof and lack of info","I remember watching a program on this book and reading the book also. In this book the author has uncovered a whole bunch of codes which lead to predictions. Some have come true, others have not. Knowing that some of these events have come true creeps you out especailly when you read about a future event that is being predicted and that day hasn't come yet.But this book lacks the details. Some of the predictions have no back-up and others give a great stretch of time and is not very specific. Although it is a good book and it has proved somethings to be true, it still needs to be more detailed."
2,"Interesting read, but I'm still not convinced.","My mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into Christianity.I tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. It was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. In my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the ""Bible Code"" does in fact, exist.Not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in God or prophecies.' This gets very tiring. Drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. The author kills his credibility on repeated occasions.Overall, I found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me."
3,Not a new idea,"Okay, I didn't actually read it, but the idea behind this book has been around for a long time, and several authors have written recently on this topic. Be wary of trying to make more out of the Bible than there is; There is already plenty of prophecy (2000+) fulfilled and God's message of love and atonement through Christ is already abundantly clear. Don't base your faith on this without further investigation -- be discerning. Both the Christian Research Institute (Hank Haanegraff) and Reasons to Believe have written articles on this topic. Check them out before you make your decision. ;-)"
1,Bible Code Challenge,"I've previously reviewed this book (see 9/2 review). Now I issue a challenge for the Bible Code to identify the real killer of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman! My modest proposal is to eliminate the criminal justice system and just use the code to answer all future questions of guilt or innocence. I am amazed at how many reviewers do not realize how easily ""messages"" can be read into any text, sacred or otherwise. I see that Princess Diana's death is now documented on the web from both the Bible and Moby Dick! Shouldn't that alert you to how easily texts can be manipulated and contrived? P. T. Barnum would love it"
3,Time will test out whether or not it is true.,"In reading this kind of works, what we should be well preapred as our attitude is always being thoughtful as much extent as we doubt. Time will test it out, as was, and has been so far for this 2 milleniums as of Cristianity. We only can watch it either getting passed away or believed to be true.Because God, who allegedly is believed to have left us these important messages, surely knows what is right and true.Kazuaki Oshim"
4,A Must Read,"Anyone interested in Bible Prophecy, and these days who isn't, should read this book. It does not push religion in any way, it just states there is a code, here it is, and it proceeds to give examples. I found it enlightening and plan on buying the next one. Thanks Michael Drosnin, from a grateful reader."
1,Nonsense,"After reading ""The Isaiah Effect"" I became interested in finding out more about the Bible Code so I read the Bible Code by Michael Drosnin and after some research came to the conclusion that this book is nonsense. Drosnin's claims can be disproved rather easily. Several mathematician's have done so. This book is worthless!"
1,First Alert Motion Sensing Light Socket #PIR720RN,I installed this First Alert Motion Sensing Light Socket in my garage. It worked intermittently for a couple of days and then would not turn off. I turned it off manually and tested again for several days and still would not turn off on its own. I'll try to return this obviously defective product. I'm very dissatistied with this product.
2,I so want to like this sensor........,...but it seems to be a tad fragile.I had three of four of these literally stop working after a seemingly routine power outage last week. They were in service for over a year and did a great job while they were alive. Last year one gave up the ghost for no apparent reason.So what is it about the design that makes these things go flat-line?I'd like to replace the three dead ones but I'm getting a little nervous about laying out this kind of $$$ on more of the same reliability.Thanks for reading!
3,faulty,"when I received the motion sensor it worked 3 times and quit, had to return it to the manufacturer for a replacement, the 2nd one seems to be working"
5,"very good , so far","Had this light control for over a month, no problems, works fine. I installed it in my basement. Comes on as soon as I walk through the door!"
1,Doesn't work with CFL bulbs,"This product does not work with Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL) [the low energy bulb]. The troubleshooting guide says the minimum supported wattage is 25 watts. CFL bulbs give off light similar to a 60 or 100 watt bulb, but burn much less energy.This would have been good to know before I bought the product."
1,I should have read more reviews,"If I had read more reviews, I would have realized this doesn't work with compact flourescents. All it does is flash on and off, even if the CFs are above the recommended wattage rating. This bit of information should really be in the product description. With incandescent lights quickly going the way of the dinosaurs, this is a bad design and a bad buy."
5,warrior,"very good item used it in my celler, no need to worry about, did i turn the light out , sensor could be a little stronger - on motion -but the best out there that i have found"
4,Motion Sensor Light Socket,"This simple solution keeps getting harder and harder to find. All the home stores are carrying light sensors that turn on and off at dusk, but they really don't have a cost effective way for homeowners who want safety when entering the garage, lighting stairs to the basement, or stairs to the attic. This screw-in fixture works with any incandescent bulb, and is great when you need to open a door and walk through a dark area perhaps even with your arms full. Nice safety feature to use around the home."
4,First Alert Motion Sensing Light Socket,I have owned this product for a long time. I use it in my garage. It works very well at turning off the light. It does not work well with the new energy saving types of bulbs.
5,Great product,Great product. Works as stated. Would defintitely recommend. Wish it were a little cheaper.
2,Stopped working,"This was a great purchase... for 6 months. Then it just stopped working. I may be silly to do this, but I'm going to buy a replacement unit, and hope that the first one was just a fluke. Other reviews seem to be good, so for $25, I'll take a chance.Other than the fact that it stopped working... it was great. I put it in my basement where I have a pull-chain light in the middle of the room. It was a pain to stumble around in the dark searching for the chain, or grab a flashlight every time I went down. With the motion sensor, as soon as I opened the door to go in, the light came on right away. Perfect solution! I'm hoping the second unit lasts."
4,Motion Sense,"I looked high and low for this product and I found it on Amazon. Great product, works just like it says on the label"
5,First Alert Delivers on Promise,"The First Alert Motion Sensing Light Socket could not be easier to use. It does exactly what the package says it will do. Screw it into a light socket, then screw a light bulb into the First Alert Socket. Voila'! Works great. I have 2 in my garage. When arriving home at night and pulling into the garage, instant lighting! I love these things. Highly recommend them. One caveat, though: you cannot use the motion sensing light socket inside any type of lighting that is enclosed--such as a porch light--even if it is enclosed in clear glass. This product must be used in a bare, open-air light socket."
3,Convenient but did not last,"I bought four of these about a year ago. Only two of them are still working. They detect motion well, but don't work with fluorescents."
5,Fabulous Light Technician,"""Aziz, light! ... Thank You Aziz."" is the line from The Fifth Element I'm reminded of when I open my basement door after parking in my garage, and the lights automatically go on. Now I just head upstairs without having to switch anything on or off! I had thought of wiring a 2 way switch, but would have had to run extra wiring etc.. This is so much easier.The big plus is that now I don't even have to flip a switch, which is SO CONVENIENT if you have things in both hands and are already struggling with the door. Yes it does stay on for 4 minutes before turning itself off; surely we have, at times, unintentionally left lights on for much longer, so it's still a plus. Excellent product!!!"
4,No electrician needed,"My wife has been wanting me to remove the pull string switch from our closet light for years, and install a wall switch. Not so easy when you have to go up in the attic to do the work. This is the perfect product. I've removed the pull string, screwed in the the motion sensor, and now we're both happy. The light comes on when we open the closet door, and it goes out in four minutes after we close the door to the closet. I'd like it to go out in 1 minute, but that's a minor complaint."
5,Great Product!,I LOVE this product. It is exactly as it is described. I have it in my walk-in closet. It works every time. I just open the door & the light goes on.
2,Not worth the money,"Long delay time before turning the light on. Not sensitive enough. Doesn't work well with non-incandescent bulbs. No adjustment of the ""time ON"" (with no motion). It does look good though. Cannot use it where I wanted because of the long delay time."
2,disappointed,Not as sensitive to movement as I expected. Sometimes one would have to move around for a while in the dark before the light would come on.
3,Never use a spiral bulb or over 100W,"I know it tells you not to use either of these bulbs, but we are human, and technology usually allows some leeway. But not this item. Even a 100 W bulb can be enough to literally melt this thing. I would never use more than 75 W and even than it may not last more than a year. I've gone through three of these already."
2,SHORT CIRCUIT,"This product started off like a dream! It worked well. Now, however, it's a nightmare. I have all but thrown it out! I only purchased this in December (about two months ago - and i've actually had it for less than this). When i first installed it, the light would just come on when motion was detected (as it should). Now. the light bulb blinks furiously before it actually comes on. I can't imagine that this can be good for the lifespan of your bulb. And it has got progressively worse, where the bulb flutters like a defective ballast. I don't even bother turning it on anymore. I chalk this one up to a complete waste of my money!"
3,Has problems with CFL bulbs,"Works well with standard bulbs, but CFL bulbs either will not work at all, or will flicker."
2,Does not work through glass,"It does not work through glass, which is the only way it would work in my case. I returned it."
3,Brighter future with use,This device will only work on standard light bulbs and not the energy efficient type. Electricity saved from not leaving on light will off set using traditional light bulbs.
1,Sensor Fails When Bulb Burns Out,"Like the previous reviewer, the sensor on all three of my motion lights failed when the bulb burned out. I was using the correct type and wattage bulbs as instructed by the manufacturer."
2,it was working for a while,"It was working for a few weeks in my laundry room, until my wife and I found it was on all the time. now I have to turn it on and off like regular light."
4,Turn ons/Turn offs,"This motion sensing light socket works pretty well. You may need to experiment a little with the area you want the motion to be detected. Once on, the light stays on for four minutes. I would prefer it if the light went off no more than a minute after it stops sensing motion."
2,Not so hot for a small closet,"We put one in a smallish walk-in closet, and the eye is too close to the ceiling to detect the motion of the opening door. You have to jump and wave at it. I've had a better product before, with an adjustable eye which can be aimed at the door. This works better in an open space, like a basement, or with a lower-hanging light fixture."
4,"Nice hands free for our garage, SOMETIMES it isn't perfect.","Nice hands free for our garage, SOMETIMES it isn't perfect. But overall I like it."
5,Simple and Effective,"Everything about this device's description is accurate. It comes on with motion from any angle like it says it will, and turns off like it says, after 4 minutes. Pretty straight-forward. Nothing poor to report."
2,This one did not work,I bought one years ago same exact model - works like a dream. This one does not work at all.
5,Excellent Purchase!,This is great. My daughter leaves lights on all over the house. This works wonders. I will be purchasing more.
3,"Not so bad, Not so good","I put it in the laundry room (as suggested). It senses pretty well in opposite directions. My socket is on the ceiling (just like the suggestion). Unfortunately, when I screw it in, those two directions are at right angles to the direction of the two doors in our laundry room. There doesn't appear to be a way to adjust this. If I could figure out how to make those two directions be in the direction of the doors it would be perfect."
4,Motion-rific,The First Alert motion sensors work very well and help a great deal from the monotony of turning on the garage lights every time I walk out. The only reason I didn't give it full stars is because you can't use them with the newer energy saving lights which is a bummer. Since most stores are selling these type of bulbs its going to be eventually hard to find the ones it works with.
4,Works Well In My Garage,"Got thisFirst Alert PIR720RN Motion Sensing Light Socketfor my garage and it works great.The garage door opens and I walk to the car the light comes on. The garage door opens and as the car enters the garage the light comes on. If I'm walking around in the garage with the garage door closed the light still comes on. That's all I want it to do and it does it well.Side note, the light is a bare keyless socket on a side wall midpoint between the back wall and the garage door -- not the ceiling -- so the motion sensing ""cone"" emanates from the middle of the left wall hitting the garage door about midpoint.Works to my satisfaction but your mileage may vary depending on the configuration of your room/space."
1,Worst Light Sensor,This is one of the worse light sensor that I have ever bought. The sensor worked for 2 hrs and now the light stays on. The only way to get it to go off is to cut the power. Do not buy....
1,Misleading,"The Amazon information about the First Alert Motion Sensing Light isinsufficient for what one needs to know when buying it, e.g. that it is onlyfor an ceiling fixture with a bare bulb, that it turns on even in daylight."
1,Motion Sensor Socket,"""The bulb does not work. I would not have bought this bulb if I knew that you could only use in a naked slot without any shaded. Even the hall light where the globe is open on the bottom it would not work. I don't think this design is practical for most our homes today that have globes or shades over their light bulbs. I would send it back but I don't have time to package it up."""
5,motion sensor light socket,a truly remarkable item ! i have several and your price and service cannot be beat!!
1,problems,I had problems with this light socket two times you chose not to send it to me a third time.
3,Sure beats groping for the string!,"Perfect for closets with a pull-chain or string but not really happy with compact florescent lights, and even with a standard incandescent bulb, has an odd flicker that could get annoying after a while. The light stays on for couple of minutes after being triggered, then shuts off with on fanfare. Nothing has burned out in the few months two of these have been installed; they work as advertised."
1,should not be on the market yet,"This device has died twice on me, both times within a month of installation. The first one I bought from [...]. Thinking maybe I just had a bad deal, I took it to the local hardware store, which volunteered to give me a replacement for FREE, even though I told him I hadn't bought the item there. When that one also failed within a month, I returned to the store to ask what the return rate was. The employee said, ""Very high. First Alert hasn't gotten the bugs out of this device yet."" So... why is it on the market?"
1,"Never really worked, and then completely stopped working","We put this into a pantry, which was about 12 feet deep and 7 feet wide. The montion sensing part never really worked, even after we adjusted the ""eyes"" several times. Initially (about 2 days) the timer did work and shut off the light, but then this feature also stopped working. We tried several different types of bulbs and changed the location of the eyes over the course of a week.Maybe we got a lemon, as I have seen others comment about the unit failing in the first year of use."
1,"Bought two, one failed in less than a week",First Alert PIR720RN Motion Sensing Light SocketI purchased two of these and one of them failed in less than a week. Went to the First Alert web site and there is no link for warranty service. There is also no email for contacting First Alert in the US. Only a phone number with limited hours of service. Still trying to contact to see how they will remedy my newly purchased defective product.
1,Does not work with CFLs,"Blinked on and off when used with a CFL. Made the unit unusable, returned for refund. Also the delay seems to long (4 minutes before turning off) for most uses. Kind of defeats the energy savings if you have to use it with an incandescent bulb."
1,Terrible flicker ruins otherwise solid product,"This product works exactly as advertised but it flickers the light so badly that I'll be returning it - my first Amazon return. I tried a 40 watt, a 75 watt and even a 15 watt CF bulb, they all flickered. Instead I'll look for a dedicated fixture with built-in motion sensor."
3,motion socket,"It does not work with energy saving light bulbs but with incandescents work just fine, useful for places that you normally have to walk in the dark, for longer periods of time with the lights on, i recommend the timer switch, you can give yourself more or less the amount of time you need and then it will turn it self off."
5,Great item,This socket works great in my laundry room. It allows the light to turn on as soon as I open the door to the room and it turns off within a couple of minutes after closing the door. It's a time and energy saver which is very important with the price of electricity these days.
3,Not a strong motion detector,"This is a basic motion sensing device.Two things you need to know about this product before purchase:1- it can not be used behind a glass, it simply will not detect motion if it is behind a glass even clean clear glass. I had to remove the glass from the outside wall light before it can be used.2-if the room is dark it will not detect the motion unless you really come very close to it.Overall I give it 2-3 stars"
2,Care about this model First Alert PIR720RN,"This is good product works well with incandescent light and the sensor detects motion at a considerable distance but fluorescence light does not work does not recognize the fluorescent bulb, care is just this model PIR720RN"
2,Very mono-directional,"It does turn the bulb on and off, but only in 2 specific and fairly narrow directions. I needed a 360 degree sensor and this looked like the right one, but it is not."
3,great when they work,"i use these in my basement where my kitty litter boxes are kept. when these work they are awesome, problem is that out of 3, only one is still working after 2 years."
2,Read the fine print... this REALLY won't work with CFLs,"... even compact florescent bulbs of the recommended wattage don't work.So, I went back and re-read the instructions and re-read the box. And, sure enough, they indicate compatibility with incandescent bulbs but don't mention CFLs.Live and learn.Other than that, the product works fine."
3,"4 minutes, too long.","Excellent product. But, there is a 4 minutes wait until it turn off after you leave the room. That is the only thing that I dislike that the company done. Also, the base is too wide to fit a glass cover on it."
1,Not worth the money,"I put one of these in the garage- doesn't work at all! The light stays on tall the time, regardless of bulb wattage. This hangs in the middle of the garage, so no impediments to operation."
1,Great idea if it worked,"I was looking forward to using this in the laundry room. However, when I finally took it out of the box and put it in the lamp it worked only for about three hours. Then, it started to blink on and off, and now it does not work at all."
1,Money loser,"This product defeats the purpose on ""ENERGY SAVING"". This device doe's not support ""Energy Saver "" bulbs."
1,light does not turn off any more,"The motion sensing should automatically turns light on when you enter the room - but this does not happen - you need to wave hands, and wave it again, so the light turns on.Now just after few month of use, the light does not turn off any more - it is always on."
2,hit or miss,"order extras, they have a high failure rate, meaning the light just stays on and the unit is worthless. 3/8 have failed so far."
1,Dead after 2 Months,"I bought this for the bathrooms at my son's little league to help save on power and lower their electric bill. First I tried a Florescent bulb. This bulb died in a day. Then I put in a regular incandescent bulb, which worked for about a month, then the Motion Sensor died.This product is a great idea perhaps someday the manufacture will actually make one that lasts longer than my bill from my credit card."
2,It didn't work for me,"The light just stays on. It's more than 1 foot away from either wall so not sure what they problem is. I put black tape over the sensors facing the wall and that still didn't work.Sucks, because I really wanted this to work. I own a building and I'd rather have the lights turn on and off when people enter the building.I read the instructions completely and not way to deal with it."
5,Ingenious product!,"I have and use several of these units which fill a special need and are very convenient, particularly in basement and garage areas. There is nothing else like this available on the market. Home Depot used to carry them, but doesn't anymore. It turns out with the price of gas that dealing through Amazon was cheaper and more convenient."
1,Utter Garbage Don't Buy,"This gadget is just plain unreliable. Like a few of the other reviewers have noted, it basically works when it wants to work. I installed it in my basement washroom. It is not near a wall or anything, out in the open hanging from the ceiling free and clear of obstruction. The first day or two it worked OK. Then it stopped working until I went and pulled the chain to turn the light back on. It worked maybe a few more times correctly then I was back pulling the chain again to get the light on. Rubbish. I got this on Amazon during a lightning deal so I only lost $18 not sure if I am going to bother to return it. save your money. For the record, I give it ZERO stars."
1,First alert Motion Sensing light socket,"Does not work well. When it does work, long delay. Replaced it with a remote light switch."
2,Not so good,"Bought two, only one worked. The one that works does it anytime, day or night, it's hypersensitive."
2,not so good...,short range. doesnt work in most sockets or even with some bulbs. not worth 20 dollars. look elsewhere.
2,Did not work with CFL's,"When used with a Compact Flourescent bulb, the lamp began to flicker after a few seconds. Not every time, but enough to piss you off. Seemed to work with standard incandescent and LED lamps, however incandescents are going away and any useful LED's are still stupid money to buy."
1,"Died after a few days, DOES NOT work with CFLs","The product was problematic at first because it doesn't work with Compact Flourescent Lights, which is all I have in my home. But the one star review is because when I did put a regular bulb in it, it died after just 2 days and I had to return it. For the two days it did work it was fine - a slight delay before it would recognize the motion but was useable."
5,Highly Recommended: First Alert Motion Sensing Light Socket,I bought the First Alert Motion Sensing Light Socket for my basement laundry room and it's working perfectly. It turns on just as I enter the room and turns itself off a few minutes after I've left. We like it so much that we're planning on getting more for our garage and closets as well.
1,It does not work,It does not work and not even worth my time to return it. I am dissapointed with this manufacturer and will avoid it going forward.
5,A great adventure continues,"The sequel draws you further into the lives of Rafe and Askana with even more character appeal, drama and action than the original. Truly a world, characters and writing that could go on and on. Tee is an author who has plenty of imagination and writing flair to carry this series for many more chapters. I, for one, can't wait."
3,beautiful Violin,"The Violin was ship in a timely matter, and at a very decent price. I brought it for my 9 yrs old daughter who is learning how to play. I was surprise to see the quality of the violin, it was made of wood not plastic, the bow was crooked, I purchase a new one. It's nicely crafted and solid. I recommend the product for beginners."
3,Not bad.,"For a beginner, this violin will work ok. It has a nice finish and a fairly good tone. The case is very light, yet sturdy. The bow is way too soft. It won't get proper tension on the hair without reversing the curve on the wood, so if you get this violin, plan on purchasing a decent replacement bow. The violin I got has the end peg and tailpiece slightly off-center, but not enough to cause a problem. One of the fine tuners was misaligned and wouldn't stay on the screw, but I was able to disassemble and make an adjustment sufficient to keep it on the screw now."
1,Doesn't stay tuned,"I am very disppointed with the violin because it's the main thing my daughter asked for from Santa. I took it to the music store to get tuned and they said it was very cheaply made and only to be used as a toy not for lessons. They tuned it as well as they could but it doesn't stay tuned... have to keep tightening the strings over and ove. It doesn't sound good at all....Also, the case busted open at the seams on the bottom when we zipped it up! I will be returning it."
2,Its ok,"I bought this violin for my daughter for her class, but the bridge needed to be carved and shortened. another money i have to spend. otherwise its fine."
4,Great Socks too!,Love these socks because they fit a women's foot so well. Use to be able to buy in shoe store now have to buy online. Order was orderly and on time.
3,Needed a firmware upgrade out of the box,"The good: it plays ogg format recordings, it kinda works with Linux, no software required on PC, compact.The bad: only one GB - needs four, impossible to upgrade firmware using Linux or Vista - I had to use a XP PC elsewhere, seems a bit over priced - but that could be because of the weak dollar."
4,Very Good Teach Yourself book,"The layouting can be improved. The binding can be rethought so the book can be easily handled and read. The fonts can be changed to include the nikkud in the font instead of being handwritten. Images can replace the drawings. There should be indicators for the recordings so the student can figure out where they start in the text.I give the method 4 stars because the lessons are very systematic. I learnt how to read Hebrew on my own. The approach is grammatical with a lot of drills and exercises. After finishing 100 pages, it made it so easy for me to use and study the other Modern Hebrew methods using the situational functional approach."
4,Genuinely Imaginative,"In this Mexican film that tells three interlocking stories of violence, crime, and coincidence, a la PULP FICTION, director Alejandro Inarritu seems to have Quentin Terantino's sense of furtiveness--however, he's hardly as wildly funny. The tales are all fun, campfire-style yarns; the whole thing is a shaggy-dog movie with real dogs. Inarritu deals with a variety of subjects and themes, and they feel unpreachy and free-spirited. He realizes that a lot of it is cliché, and treats it with an off-the-cuff, comic-book informality. The film still feels about a half-hour too long, though, and the pacing is labored at times. The best story is about a beautiful model disfigured in a car accident; it's completely bizarre, and totally suspenseful. We feel tremendously uneasy as the tension mounts. It's a miniature masterpiece, and the best thing about the film."
5,Harrowing but excellent,"I rented this movie, on VHS, knowing very little about it. At the beginning of the tape, there was mention of a short documentary, following the movie, which explains how the dog fights were produced. I mention this because, after 15 minutes or so, I felt I couldn't continue watching - I'm a dog lover and the scenes are quite harrowing.I fast forwarded to the back end of the tape and watched the 10 minute documentary. I'm glad I did this because, once I saw how the dog fights were produced, I was able to continue watching the movie.The movie ? ... excellent. I really did find myself thinking about the characters for a couple of days after watching it; especially the old man with the dogs."
5,oh my god,"When I came out of the cinema after the screening of Amores Perros, I was in shock. This is one, if not THE hardest hitting film of 2001. It is cinematicaly brilliant, beautifully filmed and created. Although many scenes are qute horrific, this all adds to the gritty realism of the film.The story lines are captivating & invoke many emotional reactions, the soundtrack is superb as well - a must see!"
1,miss this one,I was shocked to see prolonged violence and mutilation of animals used in the beginning of this film as the apparent theme it chose to introduce. I have better ways to use my money then to be shocked by someone who doesn't follow the common approach to depicting someone's poor taste. There is nothing on the plastic box to warn of animal fighting as a theme in the film.
2,Walked Out,"I went to see this at the movies and walked out before the half point. Maybe I'm to conservative, but this movie is not to far off from a porno flick. Adding on to that it was just to bloody for me. I know people who loved it but for me it just showed way to much sexuality. This is a Rate R film that you shouldnt let kids see for sure."
3,is it just me. . .?,"maybe i'm the stupid one. i've seen so many great reviews of this movie and i loved the director's new movie, 21 grams, so i decided it would make sense to see this one. i was a bit dissapointed. maybe there is something big that i am missing in the point of the movie, or maybe the point itself is just a letdown. it seems to me that there was this nasty car crash and through it, the movie tells 3 different stories about the people involved. there is a lot about familial relations, namely between brothers and maybe the dogs are metaphores for brothers. it is also about how (...) happens to different people. otherwise, the first story is entertaining and my favorite, the 3rd is the best in terms of theme, and the 2nd just seems boring and irrelevent. they are 3 different storeis which are loosely but forcedly connected and i don't understand why everyone says this is the best movie ever."
2,The CD was Damaged I had to return it.,I couldn't make the DVD to work either in my DVD appliance or my computer. I had to return it.
4,Very exciting movie,I thought this was a pretty good movie. It seems pretty realistic but kinda traumatic and sad.
4,Perhaps the best Mexican movie,Violent yet deep and engaging. Mexican society presented through different perspectives. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for some clichés it presents.
5,Shocking cinema,"Regardless of previous bad reviews here at Amazon.com, this film is one of the most shockingly best movies since Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. The reviewers are probably expecting a hollywood ending; fake and happy. All through out, the music, art direction, costuming, cinematography, writing, and directing were all instrumental in making this film believable. High praises for director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu for an excellent debut film. One of the best films foreign, independent, or otherwise to come out in some time."
4,"Great Movie, New Mexico Cinema","This movie puts Mexico back on the map, film wise. Its nice to see so many people are getting the chance to see another Mexico. This is definitely worth the rental, or purchase. Also a great way to practice your spanish...especially with the DVD. ..."
5,Very Real,"Yes, this movie acuratly depicts how life is in Mex city. I am so happy to say that finally there are excellent movies coming from Mexico again, it's been 50 years. The acting in this is great, and the car crash scenes were intense. Also the DVD includes 3 great videos from Julieta Venegas, Control Machete and Cafe Tacuba. This movie will stick in your head for a while. WARNING, this is not for kids, this has more swearing than I've ever heard, and it is rather violent."
3,"Bleeding, dying or dead dogs","This movie is not for the faint hearted. If you are OK with bleeding, dying dogs then you will like this movie. The film is gritty, shocking and at times, brutal. The movie reaches in and grabs you, slaps you around and then leaves you feeling violated. The movie's entire message is that love for anything or anyone will cause you horrendous pain and suffering."
5,La vida como es...en la ciudad de México,"All right, you've read the comments from the U.S. guys, (or what I suppose are U.S. citizens) now it is time for you to check a Mexican point of view.The movie is amazingly well written and directed, photography can't get better than this, but the real thing...is the plot. It is all an all, what Mexico's city many different ways of living are about; it doesn't matter if you are a homeless bumb, a poor public school student or a hot shot business millionare. In this city they'll all meet sooner or later to find out that their lives are similar at one level...the suffering. And that's what the movie is all about. A series of events that collide on a big crash where all characters get to the lower point they ever expected to be in their lives. Love, hate, passion, pain and all the emotions you can think of are presented on this movie by the character's dogs, whom are driven unmercyfully to the same fate as their owner's."
4,Human Savagness,"Amores Perros connects the stories of three people with shocking vividness. Each story involves dogs as well. The 1st tale concerns of a teenager who decides to make some money by entering his pet in dog fights. The 2nd involes a test as to whether an affair is only skin deep. The 3rd, and most memorable,is about a myserious homeless man who goes accompanied by dogs. The film has been categorized as Tarantino-esque. And it may be, but only in structure. The film is a powerful one. It gives a brutal, unflinching look at human nature, as well as the harsh realities of life. 3 1/2 stars (out of four, of course.)"
5,Great Movie. A must see film.,This is a great movie that will hook you. It is in Spanish but you can have the subtitles. It is worth reading the subtitles (I normally hate to) I have watched it in just Spanish too(knowing limited Spanish) with no problems. MUST SEE FILM!!!!
3,A DOG'S FICTION,"this is a good movie, period... if you see Tarantino's Pulp Fiction right before this one you will see there's a lot of similarities and the Iñarritu efforts of to take blur them [unsuccesfully], BUT i'm not talking about the plot [totally different] but the way all the stories' interplay.to me is the most over-valued mexican movie.this is a good movie, period."
2,Amores Perros,Although the underlining plot of this movie is intriguing. The movie is extremely violent and uses language that is beyond inappropriate. I just don't see any reason to expose myself to something this cruel and had to leave before the movie was over.
3,"Great film, but very graphic animal violence!","I feel the other reviews have said how great this film is, so I feel no need to reiterate. Watch out for the graphic animal violence! About one third of the movie concerns dog fighting, and the scenes are very graphic. Several times, it looks as if they use dead dogs (I've never seen a dog ""play dead"" quite like that), which I find highly disturbing. I can't read Spanish, but I question whether they have any ASPCA-type guidelines in place like we do in the U.S. As a hard-core animal lover, this was very difficult to watch. If you have no problem watching graphic animal violence, than you will love this movie; it's well acted and interesting."
2,No English audio track,"Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me."
3,"good acting, boring story","I mean...people seem to LOVE this movie. It's not bad, but it gets repetitive and obvious by the end...I don't know...it just didn't ""do it"" for me."
5,stunning! this film realy portrays its name well.,"After seeing Amores Perros win best international film at the Baftas, I had to see the film. I ordered it over the net and when it arrived, I managed to watch it 3 times in one day. Magnificent - Congratulations Mexico on producing a truely amazing film. The film layout could not be any better, with a catestrophic car crash at the start, blending into action, arthouse and romance. In my eyes this is the best film i've ever seen, i'm not lying- AMORES PERROS-a must see!!"
5,great flick,Amores Perros is a really great movie following the path of movies like go and pulp fiction with several different interwoven stories taking place in a fairly short period of time. Each story somehow involves a dog of some sort as a central feature of its theme. It involves people from different walks of life like people involved in the dog fighting crowd to famous models. It's definetely something worth watching.
4,"Remarkably boring, highly informative","This book is as dull as dull can be, but it's almost impossible to make CRM interesting. This is an essential guide for CRM archaeologist, and it does what it should, which is informing the reader. you're probably looking at this book because you need it for a class, and your prof is a wise one, because this has all the info you need. Just don't expect a thrill-a-minute page turner."
4,A Weekend Read,A great book to read on a rainy weekend stuck inside. The storyline for the most part was a good one. I just was a little disappointed that Max & Jamie was not included in this one like the rest of the FULL series. And what Happened with Dee Dee and her nutty assistant.Still worth reading
3,Maybe not quite so full,"I have enjoyed Evanovich & Hughes's Full series. The books are filled with the antics of the inhabitants of Beaumont, South Carolina. I was somewhat disappointed with this addition to the series though. Previous characters make appearances merely for the sake of making an appearance which is a shame because in the past these characters have really added to the stories. There aren't as many laughs in this one, but it was still a fun, familiar read. The love story between the two main characters, Dr. Maggie Davenport and FBI guy Zach Madden takes off pretty fast, but that's not completely unheard of in a Full story - and this particular love story perhaps has some ""cosmic help."" The audio version is read by the smooth voice of Loreli King, who narrates many of Evanovich's books."
1,Completely unbelievable,"If you are reading this book as an individual book, then it's okay I guess. If you are reading this book because it's supposedly in the series about Max and Jamie Holt, then don't waste your time. This book was absolutely ridiculous and completely unbelievable. I mean, really, two people who meet because a killer is coming to harm his old girlfriend fall in love, have sex and decide to get married in the span of 2 or 3 days? Come on now! And where the heck are Max and Jamie????? Isn't this series supposed to be about them?!?! They are trying to have a baby, but there is next to nothing in this book about them. I am VERY disappointed in the 5th and 6th books in this series. Full Bloom had little to do with Jamie and Max. Full Scoop has nothing to do with them. If Evanovich doesn't bring back the true characters in this series, then I'll not continue reading it.Overall, this book was silly and ridiculous. Completely unbelievable!"
5,Great Service,"I received the book in less than 1 week along with 3 other ones. I am reading this particular book now and am enjoing it thoroughly. Thanks for the great service and look forward to dealing with you in the future.Thanks, AW"
4,Entertaining,Gave this four stars because I had trouble getting into the story until about halfway through the book. The skipping back and forth between the good guys storyline and the bad guys storyline was sometimes confusing. The humorous parts made me chuckle out loud.
1,Never purchased these books,I have no idea who and what mixed me up but I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK NOR THE OTHER THREE.
4,Enjoyed,"This book was so light, funny and easy to read. It was a great breather from some of the dark paranormal stuff i usually real. This is a great series, start from the begining, you will enjoy it...."
4,AN ENJOYABLE SERIES ... cute title!,"A good book to read to get you out of the doldrums. Light, easy reading ... funny and interesting.Not Evanovich at her best ... but I'm probably spoiled because I adore Stephanie Plum and nothing would come up to her ... in Evanovich's other series.However, it's well-written with likable characters and a very enjoyable way to pass a few hours. You can't go wrong with this author."
2,Did Janet write this?,"I really enjoy book series' -- that familiarity of characters and such. However, this book seemed a little disjointed and there were times I had to reread a few paragraphs because the flow was just not there. I have to say after reading nearly all of Janet Evanovich's books (including her romance titles from years past), this book did not seem consistent with her work."
1,Definitely One Star,"I listened to the audiobook of Full Scoop and was bored within the first 20 minutes. It was very predictable and the main characters did not have any chemistry. I have enjoyed some of her other romance books, including her Stephanie Plum series, but this one was a dud."
2,Disappointing,"I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations. This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book."
2,Not a Full Scoop,This recording is rather dull which means the book is dull. Would someone please tell Lorelei to get a new range of voice overs for her black characters.
2,Avoid this partnership if you are an Evanovich fan,This is the third book by this partnership I've skimmed. They are not worth the time even to do that. The characters are cartoonish and idiotic; the slapstick galling rather than amusing. Avoid.
2,Very disappointed!,"I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her."
3,Just not my favorite Janet Evanovich Book,I found that I lost interest in the characters. The book was light and was early Evanovich style. I wouldn't run out and buy pick it up at the Library.
1,So NOT worth price,"Was very disappointed and can't return because package was opened. Screen is too small,it has no light to see screen and when you push the roll dice button,you can't see where or what the numbers you rolled are,"
1,This Game Is useless,"Cannot see the screen at all, Its so tiny, not like the picture. The instructions are a waste as well. You couldnt GIVE me this game."
1,Excalibur backgammon,"The product info lies. There is really only one level, and that is very basic. If you are an experienced player, you will bore of this game in 10 minutes. Save your money!"
1,Electronic Backgammon Game....ExCaliber,"This product really sucks..........the LCD window is way too small to really see and play the game. And the instructions are horrible.....must be translated in China.....misspelled words, words left out, no diagram to explain which buttons to use to proceed throught the game......will be sending it back soon. Cannot recommend this item at all!"
4,Captured by the blend of melody and intensity,"I don't know if anyone remembers a band called Trapeze from way back... they put out an album called Medusa and this album at times reminds me of the title track. The track Helicopter has a brooding intensity that grabs me without having the tired nihilistic flair that characterizes so much new music. I always look for listenability in an album, followed by the ability to stand up to repeated listening. For example, My Bloody Valentine's ""Loveless"" has both qualities in spades and constitutes an end point on this kind of scale (with, say, anything by Peter Frampton occupying the other end). This album rates about an 8 as far as I'm concerned. Catchy without being simplistic."
5,Kitty loves this!,My cat absolutely adores this toy. I am on my third one now because he keeps losing them but it's worth replacing.
