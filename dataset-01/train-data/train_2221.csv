1,Not reliable and bad sound quality,"This is surely one of the worst buy I have made in recent years. The sound is not great and, above all, it keeps cutting people before they finish their message, sometimes without even recording it! This is not clever if you want to keep your friends around! It is now in the trash can..."
1,Blank spaces in message,"I bought one of these from the local hardware store. When I tested it with a short message it seemed ok. But when I played back a message someone left on it, I heard one word, then silence, then another word, then silence, then the message was over. I returned the answering machine for a refund."
4,Good buy,"I have only had this product for a few weeks now, but so far I am very pleased. It was one of the least expensive answering machines I priced, and yet it meets my needs very well. It was easy to set up and the sound quality is actually very good--better than expected. It is too early to vouch for durability, but so far I would definitely recommended it to anyone for a home answering machine."
2,GE EZ Play,The price is attractive but I had to put caller ID in this week so I could tell what phone number they were leaving. It records sound but they are not words I understand.
2,No Battery Backup,"We have this machine and I would never recommend it to anyone. There is NO battery backup. Everytime the electricity so much as flickers, the time and date settings are erased and you have to reset the whole machine. Keep shopping. There's got to be a better choice out there!"
2,Poor Documentation on items,"The on-line document claims 2-8 rings. I bought for my 91 year old grandmother, as she needs 8 rings. The actual product only allows 2-5 rings or tollsaver."
3,An OK machine,"I have had this machine for several years. For the most part it works well, but it randomly doesn't record messages. It seems like once a month or so my husband and I have left messages on the machine that aren't there when the other one gets home and checks for messages. These are not short ""Call Me"" messages but ones that tend to be a minute or so in length.Other than that the machine has worked well. I am looking to replace the machine because I'm concerned that one of these times a missing message will have been important."
1,Horrible machine!,I have one of these machines and couldn't be more displeased. The messages left vary in volume and usually cut off long before the message is finished even with message length set at 4 minutes. Sound quality is awful and it is unreliable. Do not buy this machine.
2,sound quality poor,"This didn't get a good review from me because of poor sound quality. People's voices sound ""quivering"" and digitalized. If you just want something that's inexpensive and does what it's supposed to do then this is for you, but in this day and age of technology, there are much better ones out there!"
5,Answering machine - problemfree product,I have been using the machine for several months now and it is easy to set up and problem free.
5,This has been an EXCELLENT machine for 10 years !!!,"I've had this machine for 10 years and it has been EXCELLENT. The many buttons make it error-free, unlike menu-driven ones I've seen, where messagesGE 29875GE2 Digital Messaging System with Voice Time and Day Stamp - Blackare accidentally erased, or they're automatically erased if you don't press a button within a few seconds. With this one, I can keep or erase whatever I want, and I can replay a message error-free. It still works fine and I'm ordering a spare, so if this one quits, I'll have no interruption in my voice-mail recordings. God bless America and GE also,which was founded by Thomas Edison as Edison Electric in 1896."
4,Great System for Little Money,"I was very pleased to see how easy this messaging system was to set up and I have not found the ""tinniness"" mentioned in some other reviews to be the case. It is a great price for a digital messaging system. For me, it replaced one with two tapes that I bought about 15 years ago for the same price ($19.99) that did not have the voice time and date stamp. It does not, however, offer the eight rings described ... but the five it does offer are an improvement over the four offered by my last machine. Also, whenever the phone is answered anywhere in the house, the machine stops taping, so it doesn't fill up your inbox with the sound of your voice. I love it!"
3,"Fine for everyday use,","but when you really need quality, like when the caller is speaking fast, in a foreign accent, telling you an unusual name, or leaving a phone number from a speakerphone from what sounds like the other side of his office - you won't be happy with this, you're taking chances with it.Other than that, good-enough features, etc etc. One thing, whether it's the microphone or the sampling, myself and my roommate sound the same on our outgoing message. But that's not that big a deal."
2,none,Received as promised. Much larger than anticipated. Cheesy necklace. Will wait 'til opened at Christmas. May be returning this one.
2,Love the pendent,"The pendent is really neat and the perfect size, however the cord is not good quality. I will resume wearing the pendant as soon as I find a chain for it. The cord looked ragged after wearing it once and snapped, breaking completely when I adjusted the size to take the necklace off."
5,"Super Cute, and Durable.","This necklace is cute and long lasting. It won't break anytime soon, and the package arrived on time. Only problem I have is 1. I don't know if its sterling silver so I'm extra careful, and 2. I'm not a fan of the chain that came with it (long, black, thick string like chain) that is knotted on it. But other than that its a wonderful necklace and I love how many compliments it gets. Overall: Yes!"
1,Pass it up if you know what's good for you...,Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. The next time I touch that disc will be to throw it away....and I generally like almost every movie I watch. Wouldn't even use it as a pooper scooper.
3,Nice purse - poor quality for the price,"Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas, but the stitching on the bottom of the purse started to come out within two weeks. Great looking purse, but returned due to the poor build quality."
3,Good Buy/Odd Shoe,"I recently received my taupe colored shoes and they were nice and comfy. The shoes have a nice shine to them and the stitching is well done. However, even though you can get a clear picture of what you're buying the shoe is odd in shape. I had to put on some boot cut pants to tone down the length of the shoe. I had someone scream out that it resembled and elf's shoe. Great buy just find some pants that you can sport them nicely with."
1,Invisible Boots,Ordered my boots on December 15th of last year. Still haven't received them yet. One star for the boots looking so good on the Amazon web. Minus 4 stars for not being on my feet.
1,Would not recommend,"We received our Startech rack a few weeks after ordering via Dell. The frame of the rack was bowed in the middle just enough so that no equipment would fit in the middle third of the rack. The equipment were standard Cisco switches and Dell servers which fit in every other Dell and IBM rack we have. It was also missing a couple pieces of one of the feet.After several weeks of Startech support requesting pictures and finally agreeing to issue an RMA, the person that agreed to the RMA went on vacation without processing it. We are 2 months behind on a project because Startech will not stand behind their product. I would not recommend buying anything from them. It is not worth the cost savings if you ever need to contact their support."
2,the pigman,The Pigman is a good book it has 3 main characters john loraine and Mr.pignati John and lorain are sophmores and mr.pignati is a lonely old man with a beer belly and has a twinkling smile and has a big secret. John and lorain were solisiting on the phone and met Mr.Pignati and they wanteed him to donate money he did not donate money he took them to the zoo they really like mr.pignati and become good friends with him and then they find out everything.
4,The Pigman in Havelock NC.,"WE'RE A GROUP OF STUDENTS FROM HAVELOCK HIGH SCHOOL, NORTH CAROLINA. ALTHOUGH WE WEREN'T VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT READING THE PIGMAN IN OUR ENGLISH CLASS, IT PROVED TO BE REFRESHING. WE WERE GLAD TO SEE A BOOK THAT WALLY EXPLORS THE COPLEXITY OF LIFE THAT TEENAGERS, AND EVEN THE ELDERLY, CONVEY, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO."
2,It's Dull !,This book is kind of dull to me.I had to take a test on it at school and it was complicated. The whole concept was odd. The idea of kids who drink and smoke was rude. I read this in seventh grade. I was confused by it. I wouldn't recommend it at all! {:<(
3,The Pigman Natalie P.,"I thought the Pigman was an entertaining novel. I know the book was supposed to be relatable to teenagers, but I really didn't relate. I don't smoke or drink. I definetly wouldn't be that trusting towards strangers. I didn't think that those pranks were funny. I thought they were mean spirited."
1,If you read this book it will take years off of your life!!,"This book was the absolute worse book that I have ever read in my entire 13 years.I didn't like it because it had no sparks of interest...to me anyway.The way the book was written was bad in so many ways because for one it was outdated and for another it had no interesting things in it. If you asked for me to give you a recommendation of this book then I would have to tell you the truth,you would not want to read this book.But that is just my personal opinion. You could read the book and say what you think of it.But that is completely up to you."
1,The worst book of the world !!...,"""The Pigman"" by Paul Zindel is one of the most boring books I've ever read.There's no action ,only a description of interpersonal relations.At the beginning of the book the reader gets to know the end ,this causes ,that you are not suprised about the tragic destiny of one of the main characters - Mr Pignati. Two youngsters try to become adults , to find their own way in life and in society , although they come from families , in which there are lots of problems . The writer doesn't succeed in presenting this in an interesting manner , you almost fall asleep while reading ""The Pigman"" . This book is a typical one for teenagers . It deals with problems of youngsters , friendship , love and loneliness . Te book tries to give you advice for your life . The only advice I give you : NEVER BUY THIS BOOK , IT'S A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY !..."
1,the pigman,I read a book caled the pigman.I dident like the book because I thought the book was dumb.The begining was ok but the ending I dident like mainly because I lost intrest in the book. I liked the charecters like the bathroom bomber. About the chapter 12. I would recemend this book to someone who likes misteryes.If you dont like mysterys then you probabley wouldent like it. Matt brady
4,The Pigman,"This book,The Pigman was a good book,but I wouldnt say a very good book.If you have'nt read it you are missing something really good,at the ending this book will touch your heart,I think if it wasnt for the ending then the book well be ruined.So,please read it,again its,The Pigman."
4,The Pigman,"I find this book to be very well written. I also think The Pigman is a very sad book that could bring out strong emotion from any reader. This is not one of the books I would normally read but it did impress me. Even though I liked the book, I would not consider The Pigman to be one of my all time favorite books. This book started out slowly, and I had to keep my eyes from drifting off the page, but by the time the major conflicts had been revealed, I could not put the book down."
2,Depressing,"This book was slightly interesting, but not really. These two annoying higshoolers manipulate an old man, acting fake throughout the whole book. The teens go through his stuff and ruin his house, and all the while, they are disrespectful to their parent and dont have the common decency to actually help the Pigman instead of just taking pity on him. The should have stopped the party as soon as it got that bad, it just makes me sick!!! The book ending was stupid!!! yea, what a good idea!!! leave off with a man dying, that will really attract readers!!"
2,The Pigman,"The pigman was a very confusing becauseit goes back and forth between John and Lorraine.You never can tell whose telling the story. John is a bad boy,he drinks under age and he steals money from Mr. Pignati (how wrong is that?). This book #@$?*,it is soooo @#&*.I would not recomend this book to anyone. They will have to be *#@$ if they like this book.It was very hard to understand,and it made it hard to keep reading without getting lost. A.Harris"
2,Zindel at His Weakest,"I don't understand why this particular book has become a regular part of high school and middle school curricuae. I read it years ago (more years than I wish to reveal!), and thought it was a real downer about two reprehensible, thoughtless characters whose combined insensitivity leads to tragedy. It seems kind of extreme that a character should have to die in order to drive home a simple point about respect to these kids. Mr. Pignati is turned into a victim for the sake of making a heavy-handed point, and I hate that sort of thing.Zindel, however, is a unique writer, and I wish kids and teachers would focus on ""Pardon Me, You're Stepping On My Eyeball"" instead."
3,It was OK,"I read this book because my teacher made me-tell you the true, I thought the name for this book is just stupid. But after I finished reading this book, I thought it was OK although it was kinda boring. I've also readed the Pigman's Legacy, which in my opinion, better than the Pigman."
3,the pigman,"I thought the book was ok.It was kinda boring in the beginning. Mostly because the author introduced too many characters at one time.But when it starts to get closer to the end,it gets better. The book is about two sophmores in high school that finds out the pigmans secret. The reason I gave this book three stars is because its not good ,but its not bad either."
3,THOUGHTS OF THE PIGMAN,I recomend you read the book THE PIGMAN because it's a great book for all ages. I liked it the most because it is almost like a mystery. The book is about an old ionely man and two kid's a boy and a girl. I think that you will like this book and I hope it is one of your favorites. The ending is the best part. I encourage you to read it and finish it.BY MATTHEW DURBIN
2,the pigman,The book the pigman is not to bad of a book.I liked it & I did not like it but if you want to read it you can you might like it you never know I did not care for it . Imight read it agento see if I like it better .You can read it you might like it better than me it might be best book you have ever read so read it you might like it you never know.
2,Poorly Made,"I purchased this book for my daughter's Honors English class. The book itself is a wonderful read, HOWEVER the quality of the book is awful. After only four hours the book began to fall apart! Pages and chunks of pages began to fall out! Very unhappy."
4,this was an intresting story,I've read better books then this. But it was actually not a bad story it was really sad though the book is sort of slow but it's like I said the whole entire story line is good.It is a great book for teenagers. It really describes the realistic life of two different teenagers.
2,I think it was a good book for people around the age of 13,It was a good book and I encourage young people to read it
3,It isn't the best book but isn't totally boring either,I've read better books then this. But it was actually not a bad story it was really sad though the book is sort of slow but it's like I said the whole entire story line is good. I think it really shows what some teens that have parents that care but just don't understand need a person to play around with and a person that is forgiving and that cares. The book is alright if your looking for sort of a slow mellow book this is the book for you.
4,I liked this book because it made me think of the real life.,"When I read this book about a week ago, I thought that it was a very good one. It made me think of how most elderly people think in there head. It made an impact in my life and I am going to recamend this book to all/many of my friends.-Katie Torres"
5,"""It was a beautiful story""","""I've read exciting books before ,but I have never been more excited to finish a book that fast. I recommened it to all my friends and I'm working on another one of his books right now."
4,"An odd, yet interesting book","At first i was hesitant about this book, mostly because of the fact that it was required for school... we all know how that usually turns out:-) anyway, i grew very attached to both John and Lorraine. i love the way their relation grows works out. the unique and different views of friendship and on mental stability are actually quite fun!! you should definately give this book a try. it's filled with wit and is definately entertaining!! feel free to drop me a line if you would like to discuss this book, or anything else!!!!! luvya:-)"
5,I loved this book.,"I read this book when I was in the fifth grade. It was fantastic! What makes it great is that the author writes in authentic kid voices-- for example, the kids (in the first person_ admit they don't like school too much, and have trouble with their parents. The book is also very funny. I also like how the book alternates between chapters told by John and chapters told by Lorraine -- you get the boy/girl distinctions. Love this book-- so glad we read it in class. I read the sequel and liked that one, too."
4,The Pigman by zach,"This books title is The Pigman by Paul Zindel. In the beginning Lorraine and John, two high school students, tell about themselves and the people around them. They also tell about the things they like to do such as make prank phone calls and hang around the cemetery with friends and drink. This book is about how the Pigman makes them realize that people they like will not always be around. In one part they are looking around the Pigman's house and they find the Pigman's wife's funeral bill.The beginning of the book was very explanative but slow. In the middle it was still a little slow but the further I went the more it intensified. In between the middle and end the most exciting thing happened. I think the end wrapped it up very nicely. I would recommend it for 5th grade to 8th grade."
3,My Review,"The Pigman by Paul Zindel is not a thriller, but it is an okay book. It is about an old guy, Angelo Pignati, who is a retired electrician. He inherits a ceramic pig collection from his late wife, and goes to the zoo to feed Bobo, the monkey.A group of young kids randomly prank call people from the phone book to see who can keep a person on the phone the longest. One day Lorraine calls Pignati and says she's taking donations for an organization. Pignati agrees to meet her and John to donate ten dollars. They arrive at Pignati's place and he shows them his pig collection.The kids learn some lessons about friendship as they become closer to the old man.THEND"
2,"Review to ""The Pigman"" by Paul zindel","The book ""The Pigman"" by Paul Zindel is a book for teenagers. There you learn something about the problems which the main characters have. The main characters are the teenagers John and Loraine and the old men Mr. Pignati which is also called the "" The Pigman"". This novel is based on a true event. Paul Zindel talks about his specific moments in his life.When I have the chance to choose this book and another book I will choose the another book, because ""The Pigman"" have no action, but the characters are good choose. There are some exciting moments but the most time the book is very boring. So when I were you I don't choose this book."
3,thoughts of the Pigman,"The book Pigman is about these two kids John and Lorraine. How they met this man named Mr. Pignati but they call him Pigman. Any way how they met him was, they were silisiting on the phone to people .They called him and asked if he would donate 10.00 to charity Not!. Pigman said yes. Being alegal and all ,they met him on a street corner . Lorraine was feeling bad about stealing from what looked like a poor man . But Instead of giving them 10 dollars he took them to the zoo .Pigman was nice and bought candy for them . Lorraine and John ended up being friends with him .He taught some riddles and jokes. You have to read this book if you want to find out more."
2,the pigman,It starts out with a guy named John.He is a big trouble maker.He knows a man named Mr Pignati but everyone calls him pigman.No I did not really like the book beause that isn't my kind of book. I don't really have a book type.The only books that I do like to read is sports books.I just didn't think that the book was interesting.That is most of the reasons that i did not like the book.
3,the pigman,It starts when some kids start playing this game they call up people and see how long they can stay on the phone with thim.Finaly one of the kids peaks down the list of phone numbers and picks out Mr pignati this phone call starts everything.Mr Pignati answers and they stay on the phone for a long time man it must have been the record.
1,The Pigman: Worst book I have ever read,"The Pigman was despicable. It was horribly written, had the most unrealistic characters and if that was not enough, the story had no closure to it. It ended with no type of resolution, leaving you hanging, just like that.The Pigman definitely did not deserve one star and the only thing I am sorry about, is that I am sorry that wasted my time reading it. I should known better just by reading the title."
1,Since Columbine book should be banned from public schools,"I am so disgusted by this book for several reasons: two nineth grade loners that think it's funny to blow up bathrooms with homemade bombs, lie, get drunk, swear. Give me a break. This book was brought home by my daughter to read and I read it. I told the principle of the school about the directions to make a bomb in the first chapter. He hit the roof and said he's taking action to remove the book. After Columbine and all the school violence, NO RESPONSIBLE TEACHER SHOULD BE USING THIS BOOK FOR ""GOOD LITERATURE""> It's also terribly written and immoral."
1,A One Star Book- If That,"The Pigman was an unsatisfactory book for me. I found the plot dull and repetitive. The author, Paul Zindel, creates the book around two teenagers who take turns writing chapters. The context is boring and not stimulating, and the common references to psychology can become annoying. Also, in my opinion, the plot is also boring. It is about two teens who visit an old man almost every day. I can't tell what this book is supposed to be. A suspense story? No, not hardly. A mystery? Nope. Action/Adventure? Yeah, right. And pinmen fly. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless you like a book to put you to sleep. The plot seems like something the author could have thought up in a couple of minutes. It is not worth your time or money."
3,the pigman,I thought the book was well written and decriptive. The overall book was enteresting and fun to read. The best part of the book was when they were shoping and they were scating throught the mall. Well another cool part of the book was when they were scating in the pigmans house. There were some sad parts in the book but most of the book was fun to read. So if you now wantto read the book now dont thank me thank the auther.
3,My Pigman Review,"I think the book The Pigman is a little on the boring side. I like books that have action and make you want to keep reading and not put the book down. I did not like this book because it didn't have any action or suspence to it. I think the characters in this book were a little dull. I don't think its a cool book when the same people sit there day after day playing phone games. In this book nobody ever got into any trouble. I like books were people get into trouble. on a scale from 1-3 I would give it a 3. I would have given it higher than a 3, but it never really got my attention."
2,The Pigman,"I didnt like this book, because it was just like real life. It was boring because most of the stuff that happened I already knew about and it didnt realy interest me. I think that if this book would have gone into some thing more drastic, that no one would have ever thought of the I would have liked it better."
3,Fairly good book,"In Paul Zindel's book, The Pigman, two young teens, John Conlan and Lorraine Jensen seem to have some what troubled lives, both of their parents don't seem to care to much about them which I think causes John and Lorraine to feel somewhat lonely and confused, and ends up causing a big problem in the story.Both John and Lorraine had no idea what they were getting themselves into by playing one simple game and it lead to big problems and mixed emotions.This all takes place In Stanton Island, the main characters include John,Lorraine,Mr.Angelo Pignati,and Bobo.This Book starts off some what slow but in the end turns out to be a pretty good book with a few good surprises, Its a book you have to look beyond just the main plot to find out the true message. I do reccomend it."
3,The Pigman review,"I thought The Pigman by Paul Zindel was an alright book. I liked the whole book until the end because it was exciting but the end was just terrible. I like how the book shows how the friendship of John, Lorraine and the Pigman grew throughout the book. The near end is a shock, but overall the book is an alright book, but I suggest that you don't read if you don't have to. If you have to read this book all I have to say is HAVE FUN."
3,"THE PIGMAN was an okay book, but I admit i liked it.","THE PIGMAN was a book that my mom made me read she told me it was really good, and it was."
3,Right Mixture,"The Pigman"" is a very strange book about friendship and love. Even the ending is not the one, the reader would suppose such a book to have. But I think the characters are well-chosen. Lorraine and John, the main characters, have many differences, but that is the one thing, that made them such a good team. The story these pupils are telling is also easy to understand. It is not interesting indeed, but also not boring. It has the right mixture.It is a nice teenage book, well written and easy to understand. But it is nothing for somebody, who expects action. It is just for someone, who wants to read a book and doesn't want to think."
4,The Pigman,"I enjoyed this book, mainly because it was easy to read and easier to understand. Also because it was not drawn out like some stories, it was fast pace so you don't have to get sidetracked. What I liked most about the book was the difference in the characters, but brought together by common goals. For example Lorraine is shy, self-conscious, likes to write and analyze the situation before acting on it. John is good looking and knows he his, seizes the moment, lie's frequently and want to be an actor. Mr. Zindel did a wonderful job in bringing these two characters together. Mr. Pignati is the last major character, he is a very lonely old man. His wife died so he made friends with a baboon, named Boo Boo, this shows how desperate he was. John and Lorraine meet him through a joke. They take advantage of him at first and well that's when the story gets really good. I would recommend this to anyone that went through or is going through there teenage years."
4,the pigman review,"The reason why I think Paul Zindel wrote this book was to tell all teens that you never really appreciate things till there gone.In this case, it was Mr.Pignati. The literary element he handles the best is the characters because he describes them well. He enjoys characterizing the characters in the novel as far as appearance and personality in the book. The event I learned the most from is when Lorraine called Mr. pignati and got into a conversation with Mr.pignati and he told lorraine things about his personal life, as far as him being lonely and him missing his wife. I think the book was perfect but I don't think Mr. Pignati should have died. Other than that, the book was great."
4,BOOK REVIEW,I think the authors purpose for writing this book was to let teenagers know about responsibility. I agree because I think it is good to be responsible. I think Zindel handled the style very well because he was very down to earth. I learned to be responsible and respectful from the scene when they have a party over Mr. Pignati's house without his permission. I think the book was perfectly done and I think it was wonderful.
2,The Pigman,"I am going to tell you if I liked or disliked the book. I guess if you asked me how I liked the book I would say that the book was alright. There was somethings in the book I didn't much care for, but for the most part I enjoyed it. The parts that I did not much care for was when they were smoking, drinking,and slapping each other. I think instead of them hitting and smoking each other the author could have done something else. The reason why I am thinking that way is because there are littler kids then me that will read this book and they might think that somking is good for them so in turn they might try and do that. Another thing I did not like was when they were cursing. I do kmow that they were not bad words but I now that most people don't want there kids to read books like that."
2,70's teenage angst and Salinger ripoff,"Zindel seems to think that if you write about juvenille existentialism through the voice of a teenager, and use a lot of pseudo-realistic dialogue, you'll come up with something that's as good as J.D. Salinger. Nope, not even close. Proof of this is the fact that ""Catcher"" still is fresh and relevant, while ""The Pigman"", although more recent, seems far more dated, even quaint."
2,Not Very interesting the the better readers.,"If you like reading about characters that prank phone call people then this is the story for you. If you enjoy a more intense read like I do, then you'd be happier reading a different book.The Pigman kept my interest for a few chapters, only because I was curious as to the type of read it would be. I noticed that after a few paragraphs the story got tiring and quite boring. You want a book that you would like to read and you cannot put down. This read for me was difficult, as it was a book that I did not enjoy reading and I didn't wish to continue.So, if you're like me then The Pigman is not the book for you especially if you are trying to enhance the level of your reading. This book seems to me like it was supposed to be on an elementary school level of reading and that I did not enjoy at all."
3,A good book to read,"In ""The Pigman"" written by Paul Zindel, there are two kids, John and Lorraine, who play tricks on other people. They phone them and say something absurd. They meet Mr. Pignati, also known as ""The Pigman"". They do many things, until John and Lorraine tell Mr.Pignati the truth.At first it is boring and difficult to read because there are two different narrators, who tell the story. Later on it is interesting and easy to read. I think this book is good and I would recommend it to teachers for their lessons."
5,Richard's view of The Pigman,"The Pigman is a good book for anyone. It is very easy to read with simple vocabulary, and an interesting plot. Mr. Zindel did not focus on a single incident for to long, he jumped to a new seen to keep you interested. That makes it easier to follow. The style he wrote the book in was fantastic, he had it coming from two different perspectives. That made it a fun book to read. Another thing I liked about the book is all the variety of characters. He has a very confident good-looking male, a very self-conscience female and a lonely old man. I would recommend this book to anyone, it is good for beginners to understand and fun for everyone else."
4,The Sore Thumb,"The book, the Pigman, isn't an eye-catching book. Although, after I read the first few pages, I knew it was going a very, very good book and would be one of the few really well written books that I would ever read. The Pigman is about two teenagers, John and Lorraine. John and Lorraine meet the Pigman, Mr. Angelo Pignati, after prank phone calling him. After a while, they see that this old man isn't just the Pigman, it's their new best friend. The chapters were altered between John speaking and Lorraine speaking. It was really interesting how they both interpreted things, and to see how different their personalities really were. The book made me go from laughing out loud to having a tear roll down my cheek in seconds. With good parts, exciting parts, heart wrenching parts, this book is definitely a sore thumb, and sticks out above other books because it is such a great book and is a must read."
3,Very superficial Debth(RJ Jackson),"I think that this book was well written with an inner meaning that only real readers will get. Paul Zindels use of words and comedy make this book appealing to both old and young. It's inner meaning is very valuable to teenagers who are forming realationships. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read books with an deeper understanding. I only reated it 3 stars because once you get to the middle of the book in sort of drags on, but, its well worth the read. I would also recommend the sequel to this book called ""The Pigmans Legacy"" in which I would give 4 stars."
3,The Pigman,I thought that the pigman was a very boring book all together but the book had sertant chapters that were very good.I did not like this book because it aws not the type of book that I usually read also the book got really boring at times.
4,A Book For Sappy Book Lovers...,"This book was great-Morgan...This book is a great novel for teens. If you have ever felt like your parents have ignored you, this book tells your story. It was a good novel to read once, but i would not read it again. -JenIt was sad towards the end but it was good, you could really see the change in the characters from beginning to end. The monkey was cool..and he really reflected Mr.Pignati (the Pigman) it was kinda creepy (Bobo the monkey) and the man seemed a little crazy...but other than that I would recomend this book to 12-13 year olds who are trying to deal with all the teenage dramas...-Morgan..HAVE FUN READING THE BOOK!-Morgan and Jen"
1,Pigman,Please do me a favour and do not read this book. I could hardly stand how BAD this book was. PLEASE for your own safty stay away from this book. It is also a bad influence on toddlers becuase t hey talk about getting drunk and smoking PLEASE FOR YOUR OWN SAFTY DONT READ THIS BOOK
1,More serious literature?,"The Amazon article entitled ""kicking the horror habit"" by one Patty Cambell lists this garbage as an introduction to more ""serious"" literature. How foolish of us to think that Edgar Allan Poe & Bram Stoker & Stephen King were not serious compared to this womans choices.Patty Campbell is the young adult columnist for Horn Book magazine and the editor of Twayne's Young Adult Author Series and Scarecrow's Studies in YA Lit."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"This book was assigned reading this past summer. My 12 year old read it, followed by me. It's nothing more than an extended short story and involves two of the most uninspired and wasteful kids you'd ever want to meet; neither one has an attractive bone in their body, and the reader couldn't really care less if they themselves just left the story altogether. My daughter understood that the main characters (John and Lorraine) felt guilty about causing the Pigman's death, but that's all there is to the story. Don't waste your time on this one. There are many, better stories out there."
1,>.< I hate this book!,"This book was so incredibly stupid! I hated it, I had to read it 4 years ago in my 7th grade Honors English class. It was VERY tedious. If you are going to buy a book, try a classic like Oliver Twist. ^_~"
1,"Waste of time, negative portrayal of parents.","Waste of time, this book was a total waste of my time to read. I found it absolutely useless.This book portrays parents in a negative light. The alcoholic dad shares alcohol with his underage son and the son wastes his time drinking."
2,pigman rating,"I think this book was very confusing and it is a very real life story. I think it just told us things we had already known. If this story went on to something that people would never have guessed to happened, than I think I would have liked this book much better!"
4,The Pigman @ Havelock High,"WE'RE A GROUP OF STUDENTS FROM HAVELOCK HIGH SCHOOL, NORTH CAROLINA. ALTHOUGH WE WEREN'T VETY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT READING THE PIGMAN IN OUR ENGLISH CLASS, IT PROVED TO BE REFRESHING. WE WERE GLAD TO SEE A BOOK THAT WALLY EXPLORSES THE COMPLEXITY OF LIFE THAT TEENAGERS, AND THE ELDERLY, CONVEY, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO."
3,Interesting but disturbing,"This was my 8th grader's summer reading book. I read it too. Very funny and interesting style of writing with every other chapter from one of the two main characters. However I was disturbed by the things the kids did like bombs in the boys bathroom, drinking, smoking, etc. since the characters were tenth grade but it was assigned to 7th grade."
2,The Pigman,"fictionThis book is about two friends. They get to know Mr Pignati by playing a game to see how long they could keep a stranger talking on the phone. When they called Mr. Pignati they became good friends. On the phone he invited them to his house. In this book many amazing, yet mysterious things happaned, in result terrible things could happan.I really didn't like this book book because I found it boring just to listen to everyone's personal life. I wouldnt recommend it. I'm not really into the party and band crashing books. I think its really, kind of boring.The favorite part of the book that I read was the part when Mr. Pignati dies with his second heart attack. His heart attach happened because of all the stress that was put on him when the partiers messed up his home."
2,The Pigman,Items listed as hard cover were old paperback copies. misleading information listed. items acceptable
3,The Pigman Review,"This book is kinna dry by quite relatable.It shows reality in a teenagers life and the sadness of becoming old.The so called ""harsh"" language and intelligent writing was mediocre and not very advanced.The inevitable ""friends or more-than-friends"" scenario comes into play and is even acted on later on in the book.I think this book overall was OK and deserves 3 stars."
4,A strange but good tale!,"This book first set me off. The beginning is a little strange. It's gets a little confusing when the main characters, Lorraine and John, take turn writing the book. The book is based on their experiences with the Pigman or Mr. Pignati. They refer to him as the Pigman because of his last name of course. They meet the Pigman when they're playing phone races with a few of their friends. At first is was just a game, but then they decided to be friends with the Pigman. The Pigman need the kids because he's a lonely old man who recently suffered a loss. I loved this book. It's a wonderful book about two kids and how an old man helped them grow up."
4,The Pigman,"The Pigman is a really good book. John and Lorraine tell the story of their experiences with ""The Pigman"". One day they're prank calling with some friends, when they call a random number. After they go visit and pick up their ""donation for charity,"" they become friends with the pigman. Together, they learn about each other and have life-lasting experiences, until one day, John and Lorraine make a mistake they will regret for a lifetime. The Pigman is narrated by John and Lorraine, and together they tell the unforgetable story of the pigman, combined with their own troubles with their families and friends. Please read this book!!!"
4,The Pigman - nice book for teenagers and pig-collecters,"We read the book for our english lesson and we must say, our english teacher made a good choice! The book was really interesting. The beginning was very boring, but it became more and more enticing. Very special about the story is that the two teenagers John and Lorraine gain maturity. (no time)We recomend this book to tenagers (14-17) and to teachers.Have fun, nice book!"
3,Great Little Book,Zindel explores the relationship between youth and aging in this splendid little book. It is a very quick read and the dynamic between the teenagers and the old man is memorable.
2,Just another book in the bookstore,I expected this book to be crzy and interesting but insted it just a book about a weird man mixed in with a love story. Like a few months previous I read a book CROOKED that was very simaler to this. Two of the main characters fell in love and other people were mixed in. Basicly the same..... EVERY BOOK I READ!!!
2,"The Bad book ""The Pigman""","The Pigman , in my opinion, was not a very good book. The book starts in a town in the 70's. The story continues as Lorraine, a new unpopular, paranoid girl meets John, a mean, kind of popular kid who smokes and drinks. Every Wednesday, they have a telephone marathon, where they prank call different people from the phone book (this was about the best part of the story). Lorraine called ""the Pigman"". Acting as a charity group, Lorraine and John go to Mr. Pignanti's house, and they pursaude him to give them a ""donation"". They find out that Mr.Pignati's wife is dead, although he says she is ""away"". They felt sorry for the old man, and try to help him feel better about his dead wife. Altogether, I give this book 2 stars for it's corny jokes, and great pranks."

4,Tell the Truth to Friends,"In The Pigman not one of the characters was honest with each other. When they finally begin to tell each other the truth, a marvelous friendship develops. All the characters realize one thing, if they had just been honest from the start they would have avoided a lot of problems.This book was easy to follow and taught me what being a friend really means and a lot about being honest. I liked how it was about adolescents my age. I didn't really like how the book started out, because it didn't really grab my attention. Once I started to get into the book, I couldn't put it down. Paul Zindel is a magnificent author. I would recommend The Pigman to anyone."
1,The Pigman Review,"This book, in my opinion, was boring.The repitition was obvios in this book.The Pigman had little action. The book was boring for me. I wanted more action and adventure.If you want action and adventure this probably isn't the book for you. I would rate this book a one if that.Boringness was dominant.The book lacked much including action.I don't recommend that you read this book unless you need some sleep."
1,A waste of paper,"This was a badly written, stupid book. The point it tries to make about being nice to people who are different is completely overshadowed by all the drinking, stealing, smoking, etc. that the author condones in the characters. I had to read this book for English class or I would have stopped after the first chapter. Don't waste your time."
3,The Pigman,"The Pigman by Paul Zindel was a book that I will never forget. It is about two high school students John, Larraine. John and Larraine did not come from such a great back round, they got into trouble a lot and they parents did not really know them at all. They needed someone to look up to and someone that cared about them. That would be Mr. Pignati (The Pigman). They met The Pigman by a silly prank call that there friends dared them to make. That call may have bin the best call they ever made. John and Larraine started to build a relationship with The Pigman that they never had before with anyone. He was a father figure to them, that they never had before. He treaded John and Lerraine like his own children. The Pigman bought things and did activities that their parent never did with them such as going to the zoo and buy roller skates. The Pigman changed John and Larriane life around. The Pigman was an amazing book the I enjoyed. I recommend this book to everyone."
2,Boring,"I was forced to read this for school, and if you're planning to read this, please, I urge you, do not read it. Before you begin reading the ""Pigman'', let me give you a summary of it.The concerns two [teenagers], Lorraine and John, who've just visited an old man, Mr. Pignati, the Pigman, after his collection of pigs. They've discovered through a prank (pretending to be charity workers), and unknowingly to them, they've become friends, after many adventures.But the old man gets sick, and while in the hospital, the two teenagers deceide to have a party at his house, and soon, the wild party turns into a disaster. Then, when the Pigman gets well, they deceide to take him to the zoo to make up for their misdeed. But finding out that his favorite monkey, Bobo, died, he grows heartbroken and dies.So what's the lesson here? Nothing but life and death, and just how serious life can be.The End, that's the story!"
4,The Pigm,"Although some of the content of this book is wonderful, some of it outdated. I like the book, but my students do not always stay interested."
4,The Pigman,"There are many reasons why I give this book a rating of four stars. I loved this book! The Pigman is a heartwarming story about two teenagers, John and Lorraine, who have trouble ""fitting in"" at school. They don't have many friends, and they both have bad parents. They come to befriend and love an old, balding man named Mr. Pignati who provides them with an environment where they can talk about their problems and have fun. The thing that I least liked about the book was the details Zindel gave about John, how he cussed, smoked, and drank. I guess I didn't like that because I can't relate. For those who are looking for a good book to read, who appreciate sadness as well as humor, I highly recommend this book."
2,It can use some more exitment.,"This book has too much of the worst things in life, and I just like a book that gets you away from reality, not one that shows you the worst of it."
4,this was a good book,"Hi, i had to read this book for english class. I thought it was going to be horrible. But, as it turned out I thought it was a very good book. It had similar situations that some people could go through."
2,disapointing,"When I started reading this book, I was astounded that this level of reading level would be accepted for the grade nine curriculum. It would be useful for encouraging young children to read, but certainly should not be used in teaching young adults about good english litterature. I, personally, did not enjoy it, and found it to be rather pathetic for my standards."
4,Merilee's Review,"This book effectivly illustrates our fragile humanity. It also demonstrates the importance of allowing people freedom. Although Lorraine and John take advantage Mr. Pignati in excercising their freedom, it reminds me of an older woman I knew whose overbearing husband died. She became positively radiant with joy as she rediscovered her life and herself. How horrible it would be to know that you were suffocating someone that way, and that you were stopping them from ""living."" Lorraine and John take advantage, but also allow Mr. Pagnati to come alive. It makes me want to put on a pair of skates and race through the livingroom. I highly recommend this book."
2,The WORST in the series! DX,"This volume is moronic. The action comes in late in the game, and while it is decent, the rest is awful! The ""humor"" is irritating, the love between Figure Four and Alita is so out of the blue; at first they hate each other, but then he's saving her and visa-versa, it's just so random.I couldn't even read it through the first time, it was that bad! I finally finished it, knowing the good action is usually at the end of the books, but if I read Alita starting here, i would have never read again.Oh, and the Tuned equipment being like little bugs is so stupid!"
4,Alita joins an elite Tipharian force.,"Angel of Death - Alita is forced to enlist as a member of the ""Tuned"", an elite force of Tiphares. Her first assignment: protect a nuclear powered train from the infamous brigands known as Barjack!"
5,Everworld #1,"When I bought Everworld it was because my friend said it was his favorite series. So I was excited to read it. I had no idea who the author was, so when I found out it was K. A. I thought it would be the tipical animorph type book. It wasn't. It had a suprise every chapter, and was interesting and exciting at the same time. The most shocking part of the book for me was when he woke up in different place, but at the same time was asleep."
5,Weird,"This was a very weird book. It was pretty good, but every page just made it weirder. It was very easy reading, so I read it in a few days. I liked it more than some of her Animorphs books. I just love anything with Norse gods in it, and the fact that there were other gods there too made it very interesting. I also recommend ""The Long, Dark Teatime of the Soul"" by Douglas Adams, which is also about Norse gods and is very funny."
1,Did not get quality that paid for.,"Ordered and paid for a new copy of book for a Christmas present and had it shipped directly to the recipient. When they received it, it was a used copy and the pages were tattered. Will not buy from this vendor again."
5,good book,YO! this book is da bomb I thought I was da only person who liked theis kind of books. But I wanted to check it out.
1,"A major disappointment, gives Animorphs a bad name","I was very disappointed in the language used in ""Search for Senna. In fact, I only got to chapter 8 and then quit. I'm a major animorphs fan. Read every one from 1-32 and all others and I say, anyone who reads everworld before animorphs won't read animorphs if they don't like language. If you don't like swaring, this IS NOT YOUR BOOK. Sheesh. I don't plan on reading any more everworld."
4,A Good Start,"I really wasn't expecting much from this book. I just needed a quick read before I read The Stand. I was suprised by this book. It was thrilling, with fun characters. It is a good book for those who want to gt into fantasy.I can't wait to read the next installment."
3,Entertainment reading,"All of reading need not be the deep and meaningful. There is a place for a series like EverWorld. I read Y.A. & genre novels as another person would watch T.V. The EverWorld series is a bit like an adventure series. The continuing characters keep continuing. Any character growth is painfully slow. But, there is character growth & the books are entertaining.I chiefly read them in the tub or other high risk locations (bus stop on rainy days).They are an excellent value, at the price. Cheaper then a comic book and as satisfying. Better then a movie because the action is in my head."
5,everworld,it is a wonderful book for the ages from 13-14 years old i liked it and it was a book that seemed like it was my reading level
3,A little more research please,"I love K.A. Applegate. I think she's great. That being said, I can't really rave about this book. First and Most important Loki is the Norse god of mischief, not only distruction. He was the trickster, rather like Hermes in Greek Mythology. Now, granted, Loki is not the kind of god I'd want mad at me, but research a little more before you make him into the Christian devil. Loki was chaotic, according to my mom, but chaotic doesn't mean evil.Otherwise it was ok."
4,Exciting Story but Simple Writing Style,"The mix of sci-fi and fantasy is great work. The story line is exciting and the characters are developed well. However, the writing style is too simple for young adult readers. Some of the content makes it questionable reading for young readers but the style should be more challenging for young adult readers."
3,Pretty Good Book,I thought that this book had a little too much of the same as animorphs. Christopher is alot like Marco and David is kindof like Jake. I also think that it is unreliztic that they all seem to not run around and go crazy after what has happened to them. All in all it was a pretty good book.
3,Disapointed.,"I am quite disapointed in this book. I have read all of the Animorphs series, which I loved, so when I saw this book I figured it would be okay. Boy, was I wrong! For any of you readers out there that don't like swearing, this is NOT your book. And it has quite a bit of content not meant for anyone under 15-16. I know that it is in the Young Adult section, but when they advertise it in the backs of Animorph books, and Animorph website, children will automatically want to read it. It's by their favorite auther! This would be a good series if K.A. would just tone down the swearing and improper subjects."
3,Not for kids,"Yeah, it has characters and plot, but it also has a h*** of a lot of swearing. At risk of being thought wimpy, I don't swear every other sentence and it turns me off when people in the books I read do.--Definitely, definitely NOT (repeat, NOT) for pre-high school kids.--"
4,Cool easy handling from K.A.,"A refreshing switch from Animorphs, the smashing sci-fi/adventure series that hit kid culture hard. K.A. shows that she can write in-depth and serious, and also displays her love for mythology. Myself, I thought when I first read it, Finally! Something about the Viking gods!"
4,Weird but Awsome,This book was awsome but it was weird you go back and forth between the ever world and our world looking for Senna.
4,Great book by KA! Read Animorphs!,"If you loved Animorphs, you'll love this. It's a mystical-type book, so read it... it was pretty corny at times, so I took a star away. Also, be careful, it has mild language."
5,Everworld,"Have you ever had a dream that felt so real,you thought mabey you were not dreaming at all? David, Jalil, Christopher, and April all go to the same school, but hardly know eachother. One morning they all find themselves down at the lake,but don't really know why. The only other person there is Senna.Suddenly they all wake up in a place called Everworld, hanging from the mythological god Loki's castle. To avoid being killed they escape, leaving them in a strange knew world full of Unbelieveable creatures and beings. The wierd part is when they fall asleep in Everworld, they wake up at home, but only for a while. They always return to a nightmare. Are there two of each of them? Is it a dream?After reading this book, I was definately glad to be home.An original fast paced plot, full of suspense and mythological beings,I would recomend this book to any science fiction lover."
4,brendan gray,i think this book was good i give it 4 stars... the only thing i did not like about it was that in the next few books the characters change. i for one do not like books that change their main character. its just not right for me i havent even finnished the second book because of it.
5,Best Book Ever,I love the book. For a while I never was able to read a book because I was allways distracted by EVERYTHING! But this book was so great it got me hooked on to fanitasy books. FIVE STAR RATING. I would recommened this book to anyone!
3,A lot of cussing!,"This book had an interesting plot, but it was to full of cussing. It was also a bit depressing. But the actual story was good enough. It was about five teenagers who aresucked into the world of everworld. They all want to go back to Earth (exept perhaps Senna), but they can't."
2,"nice looking, but...",the show ran way too small-like a whole size. So it was returned. Bummer because they were nice looking shoes.
4,good little book,i got this when i got how to grill and they both have good recipes and tips to help you have juicy n not dry meats on the grill.
2,Pretty ridiculous. Talk about OVERRRATED...,"It seems to me that this author is getting great reviews for this pretentious book based on her Academy Award for ""Girl, Interrupted."" What a terrible novel full of racial assumptions, bad Bostonian behavior, & all this wretched talk about Brooks Brothers, cufflinks, and trustfunds. I never write negative reviews - I finish the books I dislike and put them back on the shelf. This time, I felt compelled to vent about the stupidity of this book because of all the great reviews this book has recieved. Susanna Kaysen - Grow up and look at the world in a real way."
1,Worst study guide EVER,"do not buy this study guide, it is a joke. I can't believe that McGraw Hill let this be published. It does not help at all with anything."
5,Works great on Natural Hair,Bought this to use as an essential oil on my natural hair. I absolutely love it. There is no product build up and I can actually feel the softness of my hair. I also purchased the protein styling gel. Love it. When the gel has dried my hair is not hard at all. These products are a bit expensive but I think they are great. I do recommend that any natural sisters give these a try
2,Not what I expected.,This hair oil came packaged totally differently than pictured. When I opened the bottle to smell the oil I noticed white things floating inside of the bottle and oil. I will not be trying this product on my hair.
2,Nothing Special,Decent basic skirt if you like a little bit dowdy with shiny fabric. True to size is about the best I can say.
2,Too much skirt!,"After reading so many rave reviews, I decided I couldn't pass up a skirt that could double as a dress. Unfortunately, once I got it, I instantly disliked the stiff, synthetic feel of the material. I decided to try it on in the event that the material might relax over time and was surprised by how much skirt there was. In the pictures, the skirt appears to have a flattering drape, but I don't see how they achieved that look when the skirt had 50% more material than it needed to cover you and provide ease of movement. I generally like Patagonia products, but this one didn't live up to its hype."
1,VW Beetle Restoration,WASTE OF MONEY!!! I was under the impression that the book would help me restore by bug back to original. But instead it showed me how to install power windows and other basic stuff. I do not recommend this book.
1,"Restomod, maybe. But not restoration","Just like the other reviewers have stated, this book has nothing to do with the restoration of a Beetle. The subtitle, ""How to Restore 1949-1967 VW Beetles to Original Factory Condition"", is not just misleading, it's a bold-faced lie. Complete waste of time and money. HPBooks and VW Trends should hang their heads in shame. Booo. Hiss. If I didn't love anything and everything VW Beetle, this book would be getting returned."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Restoration handbook?? Not even close!! Reading the title, I thought that the book would show you a step by step process to restore your beetle. From tear down to re-assembly. Power windows and locks?? Who in the hell wants power options on a vintage beetle! I have a 57 oval... and the book was useless and a waste of money. I was very surprised that VW Trends (with their knowlegde and experience)would allow such a title to be published under their name. Shame on you VW Trends!!!"
2,I DIDN'T LIKE,"THE BEST OF THIS BOOK YOU HAVE ALL READY SEEN, IS THE NICE PICTURE IN THE COVER AND THE AMBISIOS TITLE OF THE BOOK. THE CONTENTS IS NOT TO MUCH IN ACCORDANCE WHITH THE TITLE. IT HAS A COLLECTION OF PROYECTS (NOT ALL OF THEM ARE BAD)TO MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR CAR, BUT NOT REALLY TO RESTORE. WHEN I ASKED FOR THIS BOOK I DIDN'T READ THE CUSTOMERS REVIEW SECTION, THE NEXT TIME I ASK FOR A BOOK I WILL FIRST READ THIS SECTION."
1,Title is very misleading,"I bought this on clearence for just a few dollars and am very glad I didn't pay more for it.As the other reviews state, this book is simply a compilation of VW Trends articles put together by the editors to try and make a buck. There is no continuity and the articles are not detailed. If someone is already a mechanic, it may be help a little by showing how it's specific to VW, but do NOT expect to be able to accomplish any of the tasks simply by reading the articles and looking at pictures.Furthermore, each task is frequently for a specific model year, so the title ""1949-1967"" means there are articles pertaining to those years but not that each procedure discusses how to make perform the task for all years.I am extremely disappointed with this book."
1,"I""ll keep it short","If your Beetle is in as good a condition as it was when it rolled off the line, then this book is for you. However, if you have a Beetle that you're actually trying to restore back to the condition it was when it was at the dealer, then this book isn't for you. It was a waste of money, and only provides you with information that would be needed to improve your already restored Beetle or maintain."
4,reliable safe charger and sync,I used this charger for about one year. Just plugged the USB to my laptop docking station. It worked great. My phone battery never lost charge.
3,Pretty basic,Was hoping for more detailed information. Good for beginner. Will add to my collection of how to books but wasn't that thrilled.
1,Get an original name,This band is NOT the original Pale Divine out of Saint Louis. The real Pale Divine had to change their name from 'The Eyes' way back when. This newer wannabe band should change theirs and stop ripping off the originals.
2,Not worth it,"Bad audio, bad editing, just all around a lackluster package. A shame, considering that I find some of the individual comedians on this compilation quite funny."
1,It's okay.,"The footage of this video is very amateur, it was alrite, but I really didn't think it was very funny. I would not purchase this again."
5,If you like pot and laughing...,"All the comedians are really funny in this special, including Doug Benson from Super High Me. The production value is so so, but when it comes to comedy who cares? The dvd made me laugh. I also enjoy seeing multiple stand-up comedians because it kept things fresh. I would definitely recommend if you want a laugh."
3,great tunes....,"This cd has its moments and its non-moments...some of the lyrics are a little corny but he still SOUNDS great. Some of these songs must be really difficult (technically) to sing. I love ""Crystal Silence"" on this album."
3,The webcam/Skype dilemma for a Mac user,"I purchased the Logitech Quickcam IM w/HDST (961361-0403) intending to use it for SKYPE. As an iBookG4 user (without a built-in camera), I was unaware that Skype + external webcam + Mac don't mix. After a helpful conversation with Logitech's technical support personnel I had to admit defeat and return the camera."
4,Good camera - poor support,"Once I was able to finally get the camera installed, it works fine. The installation CD that came with the camera would not run at all. Other CD's worked fine and the CD would not work in any other computers either. A call to Logitech support resulted in being on hold for 20 minutes and still no support person picked up. I tried the email support option and 3 times was directed to the incorrect drivers. I finally found the correct drivers after consulting a Logitech webcam forum.After installing the correct drivers, the camera install went without a hitch. Setup was easy and using the camera with IM was also quite simple. The resolution and clarity are quite good but it must be noted that you need bright lighting in order to really have a good picture.Overall I would purchase this camera again."
3,good,the web cam is very good but the head set is not good at all. there is no control over the sound and cant hear properly. that is only the draw back. i dont know about the pictures taken from it as i only use the web cam for chatting purpose.
2,not what it seems,well I bought this cam to match my logitech keyboard and mouse...well it looked real cool and logitech gave a great description saying how it's got clear picture and watever.Well the camera has an xxxxtremely grainy picture and to be real the camera isn;t worth it... BEWARE
5,"This webcam is awesome, and the price is good too!","I just brought this webcam today and I was really impressed with it. The picture is very clear. I let my friends view it and they were like ""nice webcam"". Its a great product with a decent price."
5,Instant Bestseller,"Less than a week after publication date, Gina Nahai's ""Moonlight on the Avenue of Faith"" is #6 on the Los Angeles Times Bestseller list."
1,I didn't waste my money on this one!,"I have heard Ms. Nahai's interview on National Public Radio, and have read part of her book. I find her inarticulate and misinformed. I am sure there is money to be made in going along with the current propaganda, and adding fuel to the Iran-bashing that is going on. Shame on her for propagating such insulting distortions of a counrty she calls her home! She reminds me of Betty Mahmoodi, the author of Not Without My Daughter. Furthermore, I take exception to the comments on her book jacket comparing her prose to that of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. She flatters herself if she thinks that magical wings, levetations and clumsy names put her in the same category as such a master writer. The book doesn't fly as reality or magical realism. I did not buy this book, nor would I recommend it to any serious reader."
4,Durable string for kandis!,"Although the string isn't clear so it is more noticeable, it is very durable and great for making beaded bracelets. i love it and will continue to buy this brand."
4,Tummy control?,"These pants fit great, are true to their sizes, comfortable and stylish. However, I dont know why they are called Tummy control, because they are not slimming, and do not do anything different in the mid-range area than any other pants."
2,Kursk Compilation,"I have been interested in the battle of Kursk for many years. I try to pick up anything I can about the battle hoping to glean some new facts. I ran into this title, Images of Kursk and decided to purchase it due to the interesting photos from the Russian perspective. After reading through the dry text which is really just a rehash or compilation of other books on the subject, I was not impressed. If you really want pictures from the Russian perspective, then this is a book you would want. If you are looking for new photos from the German perspective, dont get it. And if you are looking for interesting facts on Kursk, and dont already have reference material, then this is also a good summary book. But I found most of the text was a quotation from some other source I already had!"
2,"Well, the pictures are nice","The book gives a good introduction too Russian and German artillery and tanks. After that it simply tells you that some corps attacked another with x amount of casualties on so and so day. Without any maps, (the book only has two), this long narrative is quite useless to the reader. Furthermore most of the authors conversions from kilometers to miles and meters to yards are incorrect, I found this quite disconcerting. I still found the book an easy read though, however this is probably because I don't mind reading about one attack after another written in laundry list fashion. Without maps though the reader will never remember any of the tactical situations described in the narrative. It is for these reasons that I gave the book only two stars."
5,AFRICAN REGGAE IS BACK,"C'est le retour du reggae de la cote d'ivoire. Apres Alpha Blondy, Tiken Jah Fokoly est a découvrir absolument."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"Once again LuAn has hit the bullseye on the target!! A unique and welcome format to inspire and motivate. The interview and anecdotal style is refreshing and has so much to pull from, I love it! ""Eye of the tiger"" is the prize for navigating through the jungle out there, and it's good to know we're not alone!! Thanks LuAn"
4,Very Good For The Price,"I just received this Monitor and I am very happy with it. I had the classic CRT Sony 17"" Trinitron Monitor which was still a good monitor, but I wanted space and LCD. It's kind of different to have space on my desk. This is perfect for what I needed, it has a great picture and works well with games. I even checked CNET for reveiws on this and they had no Cons and said you would usually pay more for a model like this. I have Windows XP for a operating system so it was easy to set up. According to the manual any Windows or Mac would be easy. I adjusted the brightness to 50% since it was originaly to bright for me and it looks good. Worth the price"
2,Great until the capacitor blows,"I bought this monitor in order to have a matching set (I have a dual screen set up and already had one 173S). I used the monitor without incident for about 6 months until just last week both monitors stopped working. They're both hooked up to a UPS with surge protection so I don't know why they both went at the same time, but I checked behind the back shroud on both units and the capacitors had leaked on both units. I hate having to give such a bad review, but this type of issue cannot be ignored."
5,DUDE - Steve Miller - Back from the 70s,"Dude - wtf, This is some mince-meat spicy myoosik....It like tickles my tounge when im wearin my lounge lizard suitas a warm up to takin my teenfun babes out for a swing under the crystal ball....Funkalicious....SmoochesBrentkins..."
2,Mostly Kid A,"I don't listen to a lot of Zepplin, but, aside from the 1st track, that band does not come to mind when I listen to this album. Pink Floyd, yes; Air, yes; Radiohead's Kid A -- most definitely. Like that album, this one maintains a somber mood throughout, adding sustained keyboard chords and echoey guitar to mostly murmured vocals. There are less electronic beats here than on Kid A, but they do appear on a couple of the instrumentals. Overall the album is a bit too sleepy for my tastes, with few strong melodies, and it certainly doesn't add much to what Radiohead already added to Pink Floyd."
5,more please,"This is a great show.Its been almost a year,could someone please tell me when box set 7 will be released?I loved this show as a child and have all 6 sets so far.It has everything todays television doesn't.It is timeless great western entertainment."
5,Rifleman Vol. 6,"Thought the episode ""The Vision' was very good and the acting was excellent. Also, the episode ""The Second Witness"" was good in the sense it also included Johnny Crawford's (Mark) brother, Robert Jr. which was nice to see the two of them together."
3,A Bit Funky,"Although this meets the advertised specs, I found the clips that hold the sections together to be a bit funky. It's ok for setting up once, but I have doubts about getting it apart and setting it up again. In addition, it's a bit pricey for a hunk of plastic. Would I buy it again? Probably not."
4,A Real Treat,"Jazz guitarist Steve Khan heads a trio consisting of Jack DeJohnette on drums and John Patitucci on bass, a trio occasionally augmented by some various percussionists on a few of the cuts. Talk about eclectic: the eight cuts on this CD come from eight different sources--Ornette Coleman, Wayne Shorter, Keith Jarrett, Khan, Sammy Cahn (Khan's father)/Jimmy Van Heusen, Eddie Harris, Rodgers & Hammerstein, and Lee Morgan. Not a bad lineup! The musicians play with taste and style, really seeming to enjoy the session. Not too straight-laced, not too far-out, and always enjoyable, Got My Mental is a real treat for those who love jazz guitar."
1,Disappointing,"Pompous, pretentious and expensive sums up this book for me in just a few words. As a member of AA and having read a number of histories of AA and Bill W I was really looking forward to reading something which I thought might throw a new light and tell me something new. In reality it was, with very few exceptions, simply a repetition of the same old stuff and written in an irritating style. Alluding to a biker at Founders' Day on the second page Mr Raphael writes ""The contrasting colors and textures emphasize the cut of the chaps, how they cradle his virilia, leaving him suggestively exposed."" proved to be warning enough that this was not going to be a book I would enjoy or find readable. Irritating prose, questionable and unsupported ideas and theories, and with allusions to being a poor man's ""Not God"" this is most definitely a book I would not commend to anyone. And not worth the quite substantial price either!"
1,A disappointment,"I picked up this book after finishing Francis Hartigan's fine biography of Bill Wilson. I simply could not finish this book. ""Raphael,"" the pseudonym of the author used in accordance with AA's 12th tradition, does a slip-shod job of reserching this subject, and mainly spends his time writing textual rifs based on his own interior monolog.This kind of writing seemed OK in the 70s, but now that Raphael and I have sobered up, it doesn't seem very interesting."
2,No CD-ROM,"I ordered a secondhand edition of this book on Amazonbut was disappointed to find it did not come with theCD-ROM. There was no mention in the seller's reviewabout the cd missing, so I assumed I was purchasing a complete edition."
3,beautiful jewelry,the jewelry was why i expected but it came with no chain which was not clear so christmas eve i had to run out to make the gift complete. I made a mistake and sent it to wrong address which i take blame for but trying to correct the mistake was impossible both amazon and the manufacturer told me they couldn't do anything. After stressing out over it and after ignoring the manufacturers advice to repurchase it the usps came through and delivered it to the correct address.
1,Disapointment,"I was very disappointed with this locket I purchased it for Christmas for my daughter. It is very odd looking and resembles a tea ball instead of a locket. I returned it after Christmas. It does not include a chain which I did not notice when I purchased it, but if the chain was as unattractive as the locket it wouldn't have made a difference."
1,Do you like cutting the neck of your loved one? Then this is for you!,"This locket is a jagged, neck cutting, menace. It's like a tiny morning star around your neck. My wife wore it for 10 minutes, and had blood dripping from her neck area.It seems the hinges, and general metal work, needs to be filed down a bit.I repeat. This item will cut you."
2,not worth it,Literally broke the third day I had it. Chain didn't break it was the locket. Also opened on its own all my pictures fell out before I lost it. Also no way to keep photos dry if you sweat or get rained on or shower or do anything with any kind of moisture.
2,lock issue,I loved the thought of this item. I have 5 kids so a general locket wouldn't work for me. Within 20 min of me having this locket in my possession the lock messed up. It also tarnishes very easy and is hard to polish. It didn't state that it didn't come with a chain so I had to purchase one. Picture are difficult to put in.
4,cool gift.,"I was satisfied with the quality of this item, however I had a hard time getting the pictures in. You will need double sided tape, and small pics as with any locket!"
4,"Not Anne Tyler, but...","I enjoyed this book greatly, more for the writing than for the tale, which does work quite well, actually. The premise is solid, and the characterizations of Eva and Burl are fleshed out with craft and credibility. I don't know any beekeepers personally, but I am well-acquainted with reclusive and shut-off men in their 40s who would respond to an eleven year old bundle of energy with similar conviction.The pain evident in the lives of the characters, from Miriam's deep wounding from her husband's mental illness, to Burl's empty, drifting ache from Alice's decision to move on, propels the novel without becoming maudlin or trivial."
1,skip it...,"I really wanted to love this one and fell right in with the wonderful prose and interesting characters. I thought the initial writing was elegant and didn't mind the slow pace of the book, due to the laid-back setting of upstate New York farm country.However, after about fifty pages or so I got bored and the story didn't go in the direction I would have liked. The writing became too detailed and literally nothing happened. There was to much emphasis on the past and the interrelationships between some of the characters felt weird to me (i.e., Eva's parents). I would have liked the story to be told in the present, in Eva's voice entirely, and to learn about her transition from NYC to rural farm country.I do not recommend this book. Perhaps I was looking for something more like ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" which I highly recommend. (Not that bees and honey are my typical go-to topics when selecting a novel.) This one just wasn't as sweet."
2,murky at best,"plodded through this book. struggled to finish it. kept waiting for something to happen, something to engage my interest. but i was half-way through the book before i realized i should have put it down long ago, yet i'd invested too much time to cast it aside. the imagery is nebulous. the diaglogue is stiffled. explicatory timing is way off. i am a fan of chronology. flip-flopping through time did not work well with this novel, though I truly enjoyed Graver's previous novel, ""Unravelling;"" one of the better books I've read."
4,A journey into the complex world of relationships and bees,"I thought this was a wonderful book. Graver has an amazing ability to articulate the confusion, pain and joy of early adolescence. She creates believable and touching characters, who you come to care about in spite of their shortcomings. With these characters, she creates a series of complex human relationships with no simple conclusions, and a story that is a pleasure to read."
2,Where's the story??!!,"I was hoping this book would be good. It wasn't. It was so completely anti-climactic it was ridiculous. I thought it was going to pick up the pace when the story about Eva's father unfolded, but no- it just went through the events and moved on to another pointless chapter. What a let down.PS: This book has the SAME cover as another book called Three Ages of Women. Weird"
4,An enjoyable read,"The book was well written, drawing the reader into the inner lives of its complex and endearing characters. The story captured the essence of how the forgotten losses of early childhood can create a lonliness and un-named longing as the years go by. Graver's portrayal of the mother/daughter relationship rings rich and true. The only 'fault' in the story, was that Graver seemed to 'sell us short' at the ending....I think she could have gone a bit further toward resolution of some of the issues. Mind you, I wouldn't like a neat and tidy ending, but this one was a bit too ambiguous. But graver's writing makes up for any shortcomings at the end. I enjoyed every page...just wish there were more of them!"
5,A Hauntingly complex and moving novel,"I found this novel completely engrossing and incredibly moving. The story of Eva and the effect her past has on her present seemed so real to me. The characters are all trying so hard to manage their lives but have all kinds of human frailties. And I loved all the details about bees and beekeeping, which add a whole other layer to the book. As someone in the mental health profession, I also thought the depiction of mental illness and its effect on families was both accurate and wrenching. All-told,this is one of the best novels I've read in the last few years."
5,The honey thief stole my heart,"Best line in the book: ""Again the thunder clapped. Still Eva stood in the field. Maybe, she thought, a girl struck by lightning would split down the middle and become two girls, and then she'd have a friend.""I had to take a breath after that one--very powerful image. The longing Eva feels to fill a void, to have a friend to assuage her grief is palpable.Yet, one can sympathize with Miriam's frustration over trying so hard to make ends meet and meet Eva's needs while balancing the child's ""itchy palms"" wanting to steal things to fulfill some missing ingredient with her own attempts at a life. The intertwining of the mother and the daughter is done beautifully by Graver. In a summer when honey seemed to be the main topic (Secret Life of Bees) I was inundated with the symbolism of the bees and their hives and their honey. I just happened upon the books back-to-back. Both were great but as a whole, I was more moved and entranced by Graver's work."
2,Weak characters in an underdeveloped plot,"Is it fair to review a book I didn't finish reading? Well, why not? This book included long chapters in flashback form, the characters were not believable and their relationships were too frustrating for the reader. No one told anyone anything. The mother moves out of New York City with her daughter to find a better life in rural America. Instead of moving to a small town, she rents a house in the country, dumps her kid with a ridiculous babysitter so she's basically alone all day, then commutes to town to work. I kept thinking about what would happen to her commute in the winter in New York state on dirt roads. Ridiculous! This was supposed to be an improvement over the warm protective downstairs neighbor in NY? Too dumb to believe. I had to quit reading it. The plot was as slow as honey and not anywhere near as sweet. For a really poignant young girl story read Elizabeth Berg's Durable Goods and Joy School. Those are truly wonderful."
2,A lot of potential ruined,"This could have been a truly wonderful story about a troubled little girl and how the reclusive bee-keeper changes her life. Instead, what you get is a semi-developed plot with a lot of gratuitous and extremely foul language with a perverted and shocking sex scene thrown into the mix. This book is an excellent example of how to debase a wonderful story. Next time I want to experience that kind of language I'll visit my nearby tavern where all the afternoon alcoholics hang out and imagine instead that the filth is coming out of an eleven-year-old's mouth. Sorry, but that is not entertaining to me."
2,Chass smart alarm,"I bought this item because it has a ""smart lite"" that stays on all night - problem is that you must have the alarm ON to use this feature.Other compalaint:the function switch for setting time and alarm is too small, stiff, and difficult to get into the correct postiton."
2,Mason Jenning's Boneclouds,"I am a huge Mason fan. I have seen him in concert six times and even met him for an extended period of time. I had so much anticipation for this album, and it was somewhat disappointing compared to his earlier albums. Thats not to say do not buy this cd. Boneclouds just shouldn't be the first Mason album that you buy. I still enyoy listening to the album, and look forward to seeing these songs live. This album is no where near as powerful as others. But i still love Mason and this album doesn't change that."
2,NOT DESIRABLE,"Having read NJ's first two books of this trilogy (?), I had to purchase DESIRE. Mistake. Couldn't even finish this one. Everything just happened too fast in this book as far as our couple meeting and wedding, and then the story went downhill from there. Marital problems showed up right after their ""I do's."" They really didn't even know each other long enough to get married! What was the rush NJ? Poor plot. All in all, this was not a well thought out book. Pass."
1,You Can Do Better Nicole!,"The Seduction is one of my all time fav books, but Desire fizzles from page one. Yes, lots of sex, but it lacks the warmth of her previous books, so the sex seems gratutious, not a natural progression of intimate passion. Neither the hero nor the heroine have any redeaming qualities that make us, the reader, relate to either one of them. I know Nicole Jordan can do better, as Lord Sin and Vanessa's story is my favourite re-read on my shelves. If you are new to Nicole Jordan, read the Seduction. You will not regret it."
2,Tis..... Tis...,"You guys can not possibly be serious, right? If Lucian said ""Young Bucks"" one more time I was gonna scream! I love love love NJ. Most of her books are amazing, but Desire was far from it. A retarded curse and a spy who EVERYONE knows is a spy. I did not find myself invested in a single character of this book. It normally takes me a few days to complete a novel, but this book took me nearly a week! I honestly did not want to go on. Oh, the torture! Although it is not a complete bomb, it is no firework. Save your time and read The Seduction by NJ..... much better!"
4,The Title Says It All,"Desire is a story about a spy master Lucian Earl of Wycliff. Lucian never considered getting married until he almost dies. Now all he can think about is getting married and having a child to carry on his name.Brynn lives on the Cornish coast and while on a beach she runs into Lucian. Lucian is determined that Brynn will be his. Brynn is convinced that the only reason Lucian wants to be with her is due to a curse that has been put on all the women of her family. Lucian does not believe in the old curse and circumstances lead both of these two strong willed people to marriage.Of course the path of true love is never without bumps along the way and this story is no different. Full of suspense, intrigue, and sensuality you won't be let down with this book."
3,"Average Content, But Nice Pictures","Being a Doctor of Cephalopods, I found this book to be relatively informative, although I think it really excelled itself in the magnificant photography included in the book. I've got a joke about an octopus, but that's for another time.Well Done!Dr Stevens"
5,I'm lovin' it!,"Still in the process of reading - but decided not to wait to review it. This book isn't a 'how to' in the typical sense, but it does give you much food for thought on 'how to' do it. It's an extremely helpful and personal approach to what life is like when you have an art business along with just getting through life in general. - - I feel as though I know Gloria Page personally - would love to meet her, she sounds lovely! - If you're looking for inspiration to make that 'leap of faith' this one will give you the 'push'!"
2,The Cover is the best part!!,I have owned this book for a long time....I am just starting to read it. After the cover the lay out of the book is so difficult that I have been unable to read more than a few pages at a time. The lines are so long that you cannot read them comfortably. All of the pages are so dense that there is no breathing or white space.I fully anticipated photos and/or illustrations since the book is indeed about design and the business of art cards and similar products. I agree that designing the book in a new format and adding a few illustrations could certainly improve the impact of such a meaningful story. Keep your dough and look elsewhere for inspiration.
5,"Conceive it, believe it, achieve it.","Like Julia Cameron and Natalie Goldberg, Gloria Page is an inspiration. A practical guide for aspiring artists, Holy Moly Mackeroly is also a fun read. I laughed, cringed, and cried with the author as she recounted her many trials and tribulations in developing her successful business. If you've always wondered whether it's possible to market your arts and crafts, read this book and see how it can be done."
4,Holy Moly - what a great book!,"If you have ever wanted to carve your own rubber stamps and/or start your own business, this book is a must read. It is very down to earth - no fancy publishing here, but it gets to the heart of what crafters want and need to know about moving from a hobby to a successful national business."
4,"Powerful, but I wish it did crosscuts","I got this one to replace another about 5 years old. They do wear out.The SB-80 is very powerful and takes 17 pages at a gulp, just as promised. The pull-out bin is very nice too--we don't need any bags, just take out the bin and reverse it into a big lawn trash bag.Negatives:It's very noisyIt doesn't cross-cut, so it spews out long strips of 1/4"" wide paper. This has two drawbacks: the bin fills up faster, as the strips turn into big springs pushing up from the bottom, and of course there's not as much security as there would be with a crosscut machine that creates little chads. I wish I had noticed this drawback, as I probably would have paid a bit more to get a machine that did crosscuts."
4,Fellowes Powershred SB-80 Shredder Review,"Product was purchased in November 2009 for a small office. Shredder has worked very well. Shredder is quite. Very capable of taking 14-16 sheets 20 lb paper at time. No problem cutting standard staples, CD's, or plastic cards. At shredding capacity of 18 sheets per pass it will give twenty minutes of continuous use before stopping to cool the motor. I have had and shopped around for shredders and Fellowes is worth the extra the $$$ for capability and durability."
5,Just what we needed!,"We have a small business in our home. Our local recyle company only accpets strip shredding, all other types of shredding must go in the garbage. We were unable to find a strip shredder at any of the local office supply stores. This shredder meets all of our needs and the Fellowes brand is a trusted brand we have used before. I like that the unit is on wheels and easily movable to where we want to use it and then can be moved out of the way when not in use."
5,great Value for small business/Home office,Shredder is perfect for small business office or home office. Works very quietly and quickly.
4,Pill Bottle,Easy to use - a bit smaller than I expected. Had to divide up the pills for each day - does not hold as many as my other container.
2,Pretty but crappy,"This pill organizer is cool looking but that's about it. None of the parts screw on right, it squeaks and grinds as you try to close it. Buy something else."
2,Frustrating to close,"I started looking online today for a new pill container. I wish I had read the comments for this set before I bought it at the drug store. It seemed like a good idea. I like that it stands up in the cabinet so I can clearly see it, and it takes only a tiny amount of space horizontally. HOWEVER, the pieces are so difficult to screw together, because they want to align crookedly, and they squeak so much they give me goosebumps! I just saw a review from someone who said they made it a bit better by using bees wax on them, so I will try that before I toss them. It seems so simple, but it is quite frustrating to have to make several attempts just to get the thing closed correctly."
4,"Very pretty and handy, but slightly annoying to screw back together","I definitely second the comments of the previous reviewers that this is a lovely pill organizer whose compartments are spacious and convenient, however it is a bit of a pain to screw the compartments together due to the threading. In addition, when filling it each week it takes much more time to disassemble and reassemble than more traditional pill cases.I would still recommend it, though--stack them up in Roy G. Biv order and you've got yourself both a pill organizer and a lovely decorative item!"
3,Adequate but disappointing,"About 5 years ago I purchased an Eze Dose set at Walmart Pharmacy and was very pleased with it. Over the years we've traveled & I lost one segment and the 2nd lid. No longer available at our Walmart I found it here and was thankful to find them here. Although reviews were mixed, I'd used them before and felt confident in buying them again. However, the rainbow colors were a turn-off, but I figured the new set could be interchanged with my old one so most of the new set would be in stand-by. Upon opening the package and handling the new Eze Dose I was very disappointed. The materials used are different - not as thick or durable, and the segments do not screw together as readily as the older ones (although applying bees wax to the screws helped). The containers are also 1/8"" smaller in diameter and taller in height than my old ones so they're not interchangeable. I've kept them as a back-up for travel, but for regular use I continue to use what remains of my old set."
4,Convenient!,I like the fact if I go away for a weekend I can just take a couple of days worth of pills with me instead of the bulky 1 week pill box. I would have gave it 5 stars but the stickers that were supposed to come with it were not included.
3,not thrilled,"These are hard and brittle. The result is that the pills get pulverized over time and break down into power. Plus after awhile the cases themselves start to crack. I bought two sets and three of the cases are now unusable due to small cracks that make it too hard to thread them together. Threading them together even when they are new is not the easiest, and they rattle around. In short, something made out of clear plastic (or translucent) but isn't so hard would probably work better, although probably couldn't be done in this form. this was my second attempt at finding a good group of pill boxes taht aren't organized by day or week. I need to keep looking."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Don't let the pretty colors sway you! While the concept may seem good, the product is of poor quality. Doesn't screw together smoothly, which makes using this item more bother than it's worth. The cheap, self adhesive labels don't adhere well and lift off while sitting on the shelf. The extra cap cannot be attached, when not in use, and can easily become misplaced. The old fashioned ""Locking Pill Reminder"" is definitely a better choice."
5,pill holder small size,"I've been using mine for a number of months now. I open and close each section 5 times a day, using a different section for each day of the week, and despite some reviews to the contrary, it works great. The longer I use it the more smoothly they open and close."
3,"Not that bad, not that great","I got this toolbox to store spare cables and small computer components rather than tools. The box is smaller and more expensive than some toolboxes that are just as sturdy and have more features. As you can see in the stock photo, the lid is not hollow inside like most toolboxes, it has weird structural patterns in it. It looks tough, but it keeps you from putting anything in the removable tray that is bigger than the tray is deep, which is only about half the length of a standard cotton-swab, so you can toss in some loose screwdrivers, but not much else.Not a bad toolbox, but there are others bigger, with more features, cheaper and better."
3,an OK tool box,like a previous reviewer stated..the lid is not hollow so you are limited in what you can put in the tray.. Its an OK tool box but for what I paid..I think it is not worth the money after seeing some tool boxes at a local famous store that is known for it's tools..
4,Good tool,Watched a couple youtube videos on how to use this and in ten minutes cut a piece of my fish tank glass to fit a filter.
2,May be better if you know what you're doing,"I had a bunch of left over glass and mirrors from a recent remodel. I had originally intended to reuse some of them by cutting and re-framing them. Well, it definitely takes skill... I have yet to get a clean cut from this yet."
1,Incorrect listing for 2000 Audi A4 Quattro (1.8T- ATW engine),"When you search for a fuel filter in Amazon's database, this item comes up as compatible, but in fact it is not the correct filter. I assume the quality is just as good as any BOSCH product, but I was not able to test, since i had to return it. Though the shipping was prompt, and packaging was perfect, I decided to give it a single star to warn the buyers about the incorrect listing. The correct fuel filter for the 2000 Audi A4 with a 1.8T ATW engine would be the BOSCH 71060 filter."
4,Works perfectly well; MediaCheap ships superfast,"I saved a good chunk of change buying a promaster cord instead of the Canon. I simply need a way to get my flash off-access w/o having to set up Pocket Wizards, etc. MediaCheap got it to me very fast."
3,"Mark 8:36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the CD, and lose his own soul? KJV","In a nutshell, I was very disappointed not to have received the ""originals"" of these songs - especially for the money that I paid for this CD! Instead, it's more like Christian ""musak"" - elevator music! I hope this helps you make up your mind about purchasing this CD for yourself."
2,I've read it all before,"This book is a compolation of every story we've ever heard. The fans have a tendency to blame everyone for Elvis' downfalls and the Colonel is villified for letting Elvis be a drug addict as if he or anyone had any say. The nature of their relationship was established right off. Elvis had the million dollars worth of talent and the Colonel had the ability to cash it in. Elvis went from making $18 a night on the Louisiana Hayride to making $100,000.00 for TV appearances in less than a year. He got Elvis a big money movie contract with an unheard of backend royalty. Elvis had the talent to pull it off; Parker couldn't have done it with Hank Snow. But Elvis was just as talented when he met Parker and was scraping along in the lower strata of middle class. In this book once again the chatracters are stick figures; they're one dimensional in their interaction and the story is worn."
3,Ok when paired with the XT2 speakers,I purchased this subwoofer to accompany the XT2 usb speakers I purchased at Amazon. I was expecting deeper bass from the sub when I took it out of the packaging but with some manipulation of the settings in iTunes and a few other programs I have managed to get a nice bass sound out of the speakers. Aesthetically the sub looks really well and blends in with the colors in my office. They work well with the XT2 speakers and if I choose to purchase another set I would definitely buy the sub to go with them. The only downside is it is quite difficult to get in the right audible range. It can easily overwelm the XT2's if your bass settings are elevated.
4,Nice addition to my ipod player,"1. Based on the various reviews, I purchased this subwoofer as an adjunct to my Altec Lansing ipod player.2. Bottomline--> relatively compact, easy to set up, good enough sound--> I'm happy with it (and at a decent price). Definitely recommended."
5,Great Little Sub Woofer,"I have this attached to my inMotion Treo 650 speaker/cradle at work and everybody says they can't believe the sound is coming from such a small system. For the price, you can't go wrong. It ROCKS!!!"
5,There's something special about this band-,"These guys are very talented. They write pop songs of their own brand, new and different, but familiar and accessible. One of the best bands you've never heard of, I promise."
5,Spin it on,I have purchased this from many other sources for my import car. It has a 6K life and my car has 5k maintenance intervals. The rough bottom helps me to properly tighten and loosen the filter without tools that would require me to remove undercarriage panels in order to use.
5,Required reading for rational truth-seekers,"This is a solid, well-supported work by the scientist who did much of the supporting research himself. For the atheist, agnostic, or skeptic, it provides a thorough, rational explanation for universal religious experiences, which transcends denominations and applies to all faiths.For the theist, it challenges their faith by suggesting a biological/psychological explanation of religious experiences. Regardless of how subjectively real and compelling these experiences may seem, they can easily be reproduced by electrically stimulating a specific part of the brain, causing the exact same symptoms. I challenge any religious person who is confident in their faith to read this book with an open mind."
1,yuck,"This book was really awful. I don't cae what you believe, this isn't scientific. You can be a materialist, but Persinger's evidence is horrible. And this book is unbelievably overpriced. I also wonder how anyone could give it five stars - even if you buy it, it's obviously not a classic. People obviously rate this stuff based on how much they agree, rregardless of how good the evidence is, regardless of the quality of writing."
3,3 inch Blade,"Pricey but worked, did I say pricey. The same item coma if it was available else where would have been 1/2 price."
3,Ghost With The Most!,"It was so hard to forget Beetlejuice growing up. I was obsessed when I was a kid, and I've recently become obsessed again. These episodes were goodies, especially ""Prince of the Neitherworld.""My only complaint, through no fault of anyone but time, is the quality. A lot of the eps still available to watch seem to be fading. It would be nice to see them released on DVD and digitally remastered so fans can watch them in their original glory."
2,Similar products are better and cheaper,"I recently purchased the Traveling Toddler and the Tote-A-Tot Car Seat Travel Accessories. After test driving both in the house, I returned the Tote-A-Tot as it felt less secure than the Traveling Toddler, mainly because of the use of plastic buckles on the Tote-A-Tot versus metal rings on the Traveling Toddler. The Traveling Toddler is also less expensive than the Tote-A-Tot.When I put my daughter in the carseat with the Tote-a-Tot, the straps strained when I pushed her around. I was afraid they would pop open at some point.I was happy with my decision as the Traveling Toddler worked wonderfully on my trip -- see separate review under that product."
3,Not Impressed...,"I am giving this item 3 stars because it did get the job done in that we were able to attach it to my carry-on luggage. Thankfully we also brought a stroller because I would not have been comfortable toteing my daughter in the carseat as I was never able to get it totally secure. The ToteaTot is extremely hard to adjust and must be perfectly adjusted before attaching to luggage. It is cumbersome to reattach at each connection and going through security. We have used it for one two way flight and the mesh pockets on the diaper bag are all ripped up. Despite my complaints, it would have been incredibly difficult to not have had it. I will be in search of something of better quality and design for our next trip."
4,Thanks to the folks at ToteaTot,"This product was a lifesaver when traveling with our 35 pound, 2-year old. It worked great! I took other's advice of ""practicing"" with the hook up and making all the adjustments before going to the airport. It took very little time to unhook and re-hook the carseat. Saved me the hassle of needing a stroller and my son was happy as could be in his own carseat. I had several people stop me in the airport to check it out and ask questions. Though my family had doubts when I showed them what I had ordered, they were believers by the time we go home from vacation! Thanks again! By the way, there are some similar products that we saw in the airport that looked wonderful as well...but they cost well over $100.00, some even over $200. My less than $30 purchase was BY FAR the best for the money!!!!"
1,Did not work.,"I tried this and it would not keep my carseat off the ground. The carseat was too heavy or I could not get it cinched tight enough. After fiddling with it for 20 mins with my toddler standing and waiting for me, I just dragged my carseat through the airport strapped to the suitcase with everyone staring at me. No way would I put my kid in it. Waste of money."
4,Did the job,"This product worked great, did the job, we didn't put the baby in the seat, just used it to pull the car seat around, it was quick and very easy to use"
1,Not What I was Looking For,"Wow, was this a disappointment! It's nothing more than a poorly-made storage compartment with a strap. I would have like to have something useful for travel, but this is not it. I sent it back!"
2,Works well but has many cons,I bought this for travel by myself with two kids. I had one in a backpack and the 2+ year old in the TOTEaTOT. It works well but you need a certain size handle and a strong suit case. I did not have problems with the buckles opening up though! It worked okay but it can be hard to pull with a 30+ lbs on board. Also a HUGE draw back is that you cannot roll it all the way to your seat as the car seat does not fit down the ail. Something I had not thought of and was crucial to traveling alone.
3,Only Tested So Far,"I have only used this product in practice, but it seemed to work fine. My son thought it was pretty cool. We'll see how it works in the real world later."
4,Works great but....no WPA,"I bought this Print Server mainly due to the fact that it supports Wireless G and Canon printers (I have the i860). Initially had some problems with the Canon Status Monitor giving me a BSOD but soon as I turned it off, no more BSOD. The only complaint I have with this is that it doesn't support WPA, at least for now. It only supports 64/128 bit WEP but my network is WPA. It also support my printers function to turn on/off automatically so I don't have to remember to turn on the printer if someone on my network needs to print a document. Hopefully Belkin will have a firmware upgrade to support WPA soon. Right now I'm using it on ethernet and it works great."
4,"A Great Device, but not for Newbies","I was able to get this product working on my WEP wireless network using a static IP with minimal difficulty by following the directions. However, it is still not what I would call an ""easy"" process.One caveat: when there is something wrong with the printer, the only indicator is a red light on the box. You better hope that the printer itself is more forthcomming with information, or else you may have a long process of debugging the problem ahead of you. (ie, is it out of ink? out of paper? paper jam? something else? etc.)"
5,"Jim from Springfield, OR",An exact fit for a 1973 CZ 250cc Vintage Motorcycle. The threaded hole below the removable top logo button threads easily to the stud in the air box. Thanks K&N;!!I always go to Amazon first for my needs for online buying. Their free freight offers are a nice incentive for any purchase.
3,Good but not great read. Interesting none the less.,"The Covert War Against Rock explores the unanswered questions and disinformation surrounding the deaths of several rock stars. This was good, but not great. Lots of interesting stuff in this but I think in most of these cases Constantine tries way too hard to connect the dots and show government and/or organized crime complicity in some of these deaths. Just because the FBI had a file on them or they associated with gangsters in the music business doesn't mean they were murdered. That being said, although there is no definitive proof, I lean heavily toward there being government or criminal involvement in the deaths of John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix and Brian Jones. All you people that think Jim Morrison faked his death should just forget about it. I think he just got into his girlfriends heroin stash and overdosed."
1,I really really wanted to like this book...,"but could not get past the author's hysterical and unsupported, yet strangely enough, boring, hypotheses. I feel it would have been far better if he had only concentrated on one or two instead of the all the rock stars to whom he gave three or four pages. Sadly disappointing."
2,Get An Editor!,"With a writing style vaguely reminescent of Francis E. Deck, Alex Constantine has produced what is surely one of the most badly written books in publication today. I actually found myself howling with laughter at the sheer inelegance of it. There are many interesting allegations in this book, but most of the footnotes reference other books rather than actual source documents. Get an editor, Alex!!!!"
2,"Sorry Alex, Not One of Your Better Efforts","Although he does cover a few of the musicians, he spends alot of time on Robert Kennedy, Sirhan Sirhan. When's the last time they cut a record?"
1,Dopey people on dope.,"You'll get no congratulations here on your book: This is just another paranoid attempt to slam the U.S. government, for the deaths of some dopey rockers on dope. Wake up"" there should be no big mystery as to why these people died. They all lived lives of excess filled with drugs and alcohol, a bunch of fallen stars who burned out way before their time, except for lennon and topac who were shot to death, the others died the way they lived FAST"" You see there's no big mystery to their deaths after all, just a few star struck americans who refuse to see their rock and roll idols, for what they really were."
5,"A thorough, brilliant study of rock assassinations","I have never picked up a book on rock n' roll deaths quite like this one. Each chapter is a gold mine of information, teeming with fresh insights on the deaths of John Lennon, Tupac Shakur, etc. There are many who would like to silence Constantine, and so some reviews will no doubt appear here criticizing the book erroneously. David Goldberg's review, for instance (above) makes false claims. This IS Alex Constantine's best work to date, and that is saying a great deal, because he is the most articulate anti-fascist researcher around. This book is long overdue, and yet it is far ahead of its time. Bravo, Alex, on an excellent read."
4,They are all dead. That is why there is no proof.,"""the covert war against rock,"" raises more questions than it answers. Nevertheless, they are important questions to ask, and hopefully, in time, we will find the answers. It is difficult to find proof to substantiate some of the things he says because those in power are very good at covering up what they do. Nevertheless, it is the patterns in place that make the case, a consistent tendency to ""disappear"" those who have the most to offer in terms of information about what is really going on out there. They are all dead. That is why there is no proof. In addition to patterns of behavior, it is also wise to look to motive. Who benefits? Follow the money. Constantine knows what he is doing. I have great respect for his work. If you are of the opinion that something is not quite right in the land of the free and the home of the brave, read this book. Read them all. And then read some more."
3,Avatrol Alternative Hemorrhoid Treatment - 1 Month Supply Avatrol...,"Not sure this product is helping me in any way. I prefer ointments for the hemorrhoids. They seem to be more effective than oral capsules.I'll keep taking it, but I don't believe in the miracle much!"
3,Helped some,"It did help some, but did not cure it completely. maybe needed to use for longer period. Not sure if I would buy again."
1,This is NOT a panasonic Battery!,This is an expensive knock-off. Their customer service acknowledges that this is a knock-off. Buy a cheaper knock-off or buy a real Panasonic battery from another company. They take no responsibility for their product not being what they claim. Avoid this company.
4,the legend of the wolf continues...,"FF is back with a vengeance. this time it's even better! with a new fighter in the group and a better story line, who could ask for more? anyway, the story started with a battle between Terry Bogard and Krauser. Terry lost and he could not believe it and he started to be a drunkard. poor guy. meanwhile, Andy Bogard was practising his martial art when his so-call-fiancee Mai Shiranui shows up. She was pretty and 'bouncy' too. Joe Higashi, the Thai Kick boxer also appear to join Andy and Mai to defeat Krauser. Krauser is a very tough and powerful man, even Joe could not stopped him. that leave Andy and Terry to defeat Krauser. In attempt to defeat Krauser, Terry create a new technique called 'Power Geyser' and defeated Andy. so with a new technique and determination, Terry skillfully defeated Krauser."
3,Not satisfied,The metal used in these push points is not as heavy/sturdy as I had expected. They tend to bend on harder wood frames.
1,Are you kidding me,Tried to save some money by buying these online. Amazon sent me 2 sets of passenger side brake pads and none for the drivers side. Dont buy these pads.
2,Only works for a day or two.,"We have used this twice in our home and still have a pretty bad flea infestation. We first vacuumed like crazy, bleached the tile floors, then used the spray. I was pretty happy when we came home and there seemed to be next to no fleas, but about two days later, they were back full force. We decided to give it one more try about a week later and got the same result. This spray is definitely not a permenant solution."
4,Great anthology series,"This is one of the finer antholgies to come along in a long time (since the hey day of Dark Horse Presents). Like any anthology, you usually hope that, say, 60% of the stories will fit what you like; Students of the Unusual delivers way more than that. These stories are fun, compelling and just a bit twisted. And I absolutely love the artwork. It's so nice to see some fresh, new artists on the scene. J. Chris Campbell's work on the downright funny ""Recalcitrant Jones and the Dead Beats"" is worth the price of admission alone. Then you get Ply Bernatene's art in ""Moko Mokai"", perfectly suited for Terry Cronin's story. And I haven't even talked about the issues of Students of the Unusual after this one (you need to check out the art on issue #4's ""Nikook and the Tupilak""). Give this series a try!"
1,I cannot believe the gall,"I ordered this TV (model 32DF46 as listed here) on 11/8/06. Amazon TWICE delivered the older model (model # 32D46), which I refused (took a total of 3 says off from work to accept delivery, have the wrong model picked up, then await delivery again but refused it on the spot). Then they sent me an email stating that the problem was not going to be resolved easily, but when I checked the website, the model I ordered was still available but at a significantly higher price (can you say ""Bait & Switch""???) As of today (1/9/2007) I have heard nothing from Amazon since the 1st email, still don't have the TV I ordered on 11/8/06 BUT today they sent me a request to come here and review it. So I obliged."
5,"Once it got here, great","Quite pleased with the TV, good picture, no problems, except for shipping.Shipping company had wrong address, so did not receive TV as soon as possible. Finaly straightened out, received TV. They delivered the TV,unpacked it and set it on my stand and they woould have hauled the box away, but thought I had better keep it a while.Could not find another TV of this size with all the features for the price. Yes, a good buy and well satisfied. Richard L., Texas"
1,A Ridiculous Premise,"In 2004, the Boston Red Sox finished four games behind the New York Yankees at the conclusion of a 162-game regular season. In the playoffs, after losing three games to the Yankees, the Red Sox -- using the momentum from the fourth game victory, if one believes in such things -- got red hot for seven games. That's it -- an eight-game hot streak. Period. Then, it was over. Boston still couldn't beat the Yankees in the 2005 regular season, and got swept out of the '05 playoffs. Anyone who attempts to draw any great conclusions from the above scenario ... who makes the Red Sox ""plan"" a model because of an eight-game hot streak, has absolutely no concept of baseball. That renders this book useless."
5,incredible!!,"Its very compact,it offers an exquisite sound. i cant think of any thing to say... its just great!! its definetly something you'll drool over to own!!!"
3,More for the artist than beginner,"This book is instructive but more from a artistic viewpoint than for a beginner. While all the necessary information is there, the photos are more a showcase for the author rather than providing additional instruction or explanation of the techniques. Not recommended for a complete beginner"
3,Not what I was expecting but good,It might be that I missed something in the reviews I read earlier but this was -- in affect -- a book length poem! So it took a while to into the swing of reading it but the reward is worth the effort. The whole thing is just a little flowery for us these days but still a beautiful story of love and fantasy -- I'd recommend it.
4,Like it - but not without a few annoyances,"Gave as a Christmas gift - never opened out of the box and there was a chip on the top of the frame.The recipient decided to keep it anyway as they were excited to set it up.The picture quality is very good. The remote works from about 7 feet away (which is pretty good).Overall this product looks nicer than most.Aside from the chip on the top of the frame, the worse part was the protective cover over the LCD. It did not come off in 1 piece and STILL has pieces stuck around the edges of the LCD/frame area - just impossible to remove it without invalidating the warranty or risk nicking the LCD.Still like the product and would recommend it however."
1,Picture Is Not Accurate,"If you like the way the frame looks in the picture you will be sadly disappointed when it arrives. The picture they shows that there is not matte around the screen. when you receive yours it is large, bulky, has a 3/4 inch matte around the frame that looks cheap, plus the frame appears to be put together buy someone with poor craftsmanship. I purchased one of these frames [...] and they screwed me over on the deal. I just want everyone to be aware that your item will not look like this picture."
5,Excellent Book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The character development was well thought out, the plot was superiour, and the entire book held my attention from beginning to end! It's also nice to see a lesbian main character go through ""real life""."
5,PERFECT!,"This book is perfect to me. Every actor seems to be alive. And if you know L.A., you know the Nightwood Bar and every place in this book."
5,The Bone,"Awesome docu and update for one of the most underrated bands ever. Fishbone's path hasnt been an easy one and that is shown in the documentary, but their powerful influence on the industry is well verified. Great live show and pure."
4,Truly interesting fan or not,"I am a fan of many genres of music, I am not a musician, but love and respect though who create music. I have always enjoyed fishbone's music - although I actually don't even own any of their albums. But I was very interested in this documentary knowing how out there their music was.Visually a very cool documentary - cool graphics, Laurence Fishburne narrates. I came away from this thinking how dedicated these artist are. To stick with it so long without the financial reward.If you are in a band, wish you were in a band, or know musicians, or just like music - no matter the type of music - this is one documentary you should not miss."
4,"A great look at one of the most talented, and under appreciated bands ever","This is an honest look at a great band, who is oozing with talent, yet still struggles to pay their rent each month. Fishbone is a live band, their albums fail in comparison to their live shows. To be honest, I can't name one Fishbone song- but I do remember their shows. Those of you who like GWAR will know what I'm talking about. The documentary is worth watching, even for the music fan who has never heard of them."
4,Eye-opening Account of Espionage,"This book will open your eyes to the real world of espionage, carried out over many years during the height of the Cold War. This time, the spying is about nerve gas, and provides a sobering realization of the games being played without the public knowing about it. This book also shows how politics can destroy the best efforts of catching spies in the U.S."
5,Frighteningly well done!,"Ms. Temmerman has provided the reader with a glimpse into the madness that is central Africa. Joseph Kony and his LRA are still in the mix, although they rely more on Islam these days than Christianity to justify their savagery. This book is highly recommended for those with an interest in Central Africa and the challenges that remain. Highly recommended."
1,disppointed,"I was very excited to see that there was a work-out video recommended by Dr Oz. His no nonsense attitude towards being a healty person made me realize that I have no excuse to not be exercizing or eating right. I could hardly wait to get the dvd once I ordered it. Well the video seems made for people who are already in good shape, and have no physical limitations. I could hardly do the warm-ups, and once the instructor decided to spend a massive amount of time having you put your weight on your knees, I was done. I can't kneel on the ground due to surgery, and his suggestion of putting a towel underneath to cushion you was not helpful. If you know these excercizes will not be comfortable (or possible) for a large number of people, how about modifying them so we can do them?"
4,"""YOU"" Staying Young DVD","This DVD is excellent. It's particularly good for the average person who has had a long break from exercises. The presentation is non-threatening...no rock hard bodies, no sexy outfits, just a comfy ""at home"" exercise program. For the revised edition it might be a good idea to consider a pre-level 1 for persons who are obese and/or suffering fom back problems. The hip raises and one of the abdominals in level 1 could be painful and challenging for those persons. Overall,I love this product!"
5,great workouts,these short less then 20 minute workouts are fantastic easy to follow and a great day starter.
2,A workout for beginners or older folks,"I was excited about using this workout DVD since the doctors who endorse it are on Oprah and we all know Oprah's got good taste! However, after viewing and working out to the entire DVD, I was surprised at how easy it was-- too easy. I think that it is a good start for people who are new to exercise and for say, my 80 year old grandparents, but not much more than that."
1,Very disappointing,"As a senior, I wasted my money on this DVD. There's a lot of rolling on the floor. I didn't need a DVD to do crunches and donkey kicks. Not appropriate for older folks."
4,You Staying Young Workout,What few times I have excercised with the DVD I have enjoyed it and and felt the results. I actually look forward working in time to do it.
4,"Nice and Easy, but not too easy","The two workouts are really decent. The first one gets you into working out if you haven't or it's a good workout for someone who has limited abilities (or age). The second workout pumps you up a little harder. I think both of the exercise routines are less than 20 minutes. The moves are easy to remember and for some of the warmout moves or stretches I find myself doing them when I have a few minutes on my hands or I'm waiting somewhere.The chi gong routine is great. I would have liked more of it. It really does boost your energy and I feel extremely at peace and joyful when I finish it.With all workouts and basically anything in life - you get out of it, what you put into it."
3,You Staying Young Workout,"I suppose this could be a pretty good workout. I'm not sure what age group it is intended to reach. I fatigued easily in some spots. Infortunately the Qi-gong part was disappointing ( not real sure, I moved any chi)"
3,"Interesting, but not new information",The book by Dr. Oz is all the same information he shares on Oprah and in his other books.
3,Staying Young Workout,"I will have to let you know in a few years. The book looks great and sounds wonderful, but the jury is still out since I just got the book a month ago."
5,great read and gift of health give this book to evryone you know,"looking for a gift for that fat sloppy uncle or that person who needs a wake up call on health but you just don't know how to tell them well this is the perfect book to give along with the workout dvd, they will thank you later"
3,Not the greatest,I have the You on a Diet Workout also and thought that was much better and more effective.
4,A Pretty Good CD,"This is a good CD to dance to, but the beats that were chosen are lacking a little bit. I thought the ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" song on this album would be a dance remix, but it's actually a slow version of the hit song, which was surprising and a little disappointing because the slow beat gives a romantic feel to a very unromantic song. But if you think ""Shake Your Bon Bon"" is already a great dance song (as I do), then you'll LOVE this CD (and you may not be able to stop dancing!) Hopefully this was helpful!"
1,"This book is a ""for real"" phenomenon...","It's an entertaining read: from his denial of the wave nature of light to his insistence that gravitational waves are ""the ether,"" Walker boldly defies the prevailing theories about space, time and cosmology, re-invents General Relativity to make new and different predictions about the motion of the planets around our Sun, and presents the shocking conclusion that only charged neutrinos can travel at the speed of light.If you prefer the mainstream approach (I suppose Walker would call it ""False Gravity""), read Sean M. Carroll's textbook:Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity."
1,True comedy,This book is teh best comedy evar!!!1one1! Anyone else working towards their PhD in Physics knows that things can get stressful. Sometimes you just need a good laugh. This is also a great book to put in each grad student and professor departmental mailbox on April Fool's Day.
5,One Of The Best !,"This Cd was one of my favorite BSB singles. It included Larger Than Life (album version as well as the instrumental)and a great song that Aj helped co-write, ""If you knew what i knew"". That was a great song and the vocals are beautiful. I highly reccommend it !"
2,"great use of language, sub-par storyline","When I first picked up the book and read the DJ summary, it seemed interesting and original. While Lasdun has great use of the English language, truelly poetic, the storyline is disappointing however.The mystery can be guessed from the first few pages. It starts off being complicated, and strengthens in complexity, until everything comes together at the end. Great, except the ending is NOT surprising at all. Plus, the story gets TOO complicated, and TOO thick with names, events and symbolism that the joy of reading Lasdun's beautiful writing is hampered.I think you should read this book purely for Lasdun's writing, not his story telling. I personally think he should stick to writing poetry, where he excels."
4,AT LEAST IT'S DIFFERENT,"With authors putting out the same garbage and using the same formula, it's refreshing to finally read a story that's a little bit off the wall. The ""oddness"" of the novel held my interest throughout and kept me wondering what was next. The descent into madness, by the main character, was very disturbing."
2,"Might give him another chance, but not impressed...","I agree with the previous reviewer, in that I rated this book a 2 rather than a 1 due to the fine writing that kept my interest despite the fact that I could predict the outcome from the very first page. I kept waiting for the author to prove my theory wrong. He did not.In addition, call me detail-obsessed, but I found the author's description of the ""small city"" of Corinth extremely distracting--this very small town does in fact exist about 150 miles north of NYC, and bears no resemblance whatsoever to the place he describes in his narrative (I grew up there). I could excuse the fact that there is no bus station in the town, but there is not a [...] or [...] for miles around, let alone ""dilapidated mansions."" I understand that the name is symbolic, but perhaps he might have either done some research or placed it in Pennsylvania???"
1,Write this only for the justice of some good author,"Poor plot if there is any real effort in it,poor content, nothing new!"
1,Worst Book I've Read In Years,"Mr. Lasdun teaches creative writing. Sometimes that old adage, ""Those who can, do; Those who cannot, teach."" is true. In the case of The Horned Man, as I read the end, I felt sorry for his students.Although the author has a nice command of adjectives, and actually had a fairly original plot, what was his publisher thinking?Please don't spend your next [$$$] on this book."
1,Unicorn?,"I was left with several waisted hours. What happened and why am I to understand what a Unicorn has to do with reading Shakespeare, murder, and a broken marriage. It seems to me that each paragraph reads well but has nothing to do with the story."
3,somewhat disappointed,"a book that gets me to its finish gets an automatic two stars; if it's well written, that's a third star. but it's got to be pretty compelling to get more from me, and ""the horned man,"" to my mind, just didn't deliver on its great, early promise. the first half of the book was pretty chilling and hypnotic; i felt i was submerged in a riveting novel, transported by the ominous narrative voice. But the second half of the book loses steam; the author's cleverness, intellect, and virtuostic language get in the way, derailing the story. the paranoia grows cloying and less interesting, the plot grows cumbersome. i finished the book without much trouble, but also missing the thrill I felt in the novel's opening sections."
3,"An Auster, Please, but Hold the Heart","The use of language and imagery is top-notch in this novel, which comes as no surprise, as Lasdun is also an excellent poet. This Lasdun novel reminds me of the works of Paul Auster - it's sharply written and has weird/wacky plot points that wake you up from the trance of the wonderful prose - but unlike the best works of Auster, this book doesn't have much heart. There's no doubt it's a smart work, but I just could never feel much of anything for the main character.Still, it's an interesting work. It did lose me a little as the novel got progressively stranger, but the first 3/4 is pretty mysterious stuff and worth checking out."
2,Going nowhere fast,"Has its moments, and the prose is good (what one would expect from a poet). But the bright little fragments of the mosaic never coalesce into a larger picture. Confusing, episodic, rambiling and disconnected. The ending disappoints. Hardly the page-turner others have made it out to be."
5,Awesome calendar,I just received for my birthday this GOF calendar and the new ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence. The calendar has great visuals and the trivia book was loaded with new information on the GOF Movie 4 that every HP fan will love. Highly recommend.
1,Delivery is a problem,"Good luck actually getting this item. Delivery is a severe problem. I have been back-ordered three times. Latest estimate is 7 weeks after the order was placed. Recommend you call your local bookstores for stock instead of relying on false delivery promises, especially if this is a gift."
1,Boo Hoo,I never freakin got this calendar cause they don't have anymore in stock or something. And I get Harry Potter movie calendars every year. It sucks.
4,Jillann Ann puts out some really good avant pop...,"Jillann Ann puts out some really good avant pop...My fave tracks are ""Fragile"", ""Vapour"", ""Precious""...If I had to compare her to someone, she comes closes to Tori Amos in her style/presentation of her music...Jillian Ann is also an artist, model + much more...I would definitely recommend you pick this cd up..."

2,Not as thick as I had hoped.,"The stair treds I purchased were not very thick, only 1/4"" thickness. Also, they were smooth and flat, which makes them incapable of taking any snow or ice off your shoes when walking on them. I will have to wait until winter to see how effective they are.I liked the design in them, and they cover more than half the with of my steps. It would have been nice if they were longer.The adeasive that is to stick them to the steps is inadequate to stick them to concrete steps. Mine move around slightly because the sticky stuff only works in random places. They would most likely would work on wood or latex floors better."
2,Product Changed - Disregard previous reviews!,"Purchased mats for their ""easy peel and stick backing"". After peeling paper off, noticed there was no ""sticky"" backing whatsoever. Called seller who told me to buy double sided tape to secure them to stairs. Told them this was ridiculous, since the description clearly states they have a sticky backing. Was told by seller the manufacturer changed the backing and they are no longer sticky. These mats look nice and sturdy, but if you are looking for a sticky back, these are not for you. Had to fight for a shipping refund due to false description. Amazon should make seller revise description."
2,disappointing,The treds looked good. the very thin piece of stickiness on the back was not sufficient to keep the pads stuck to the steps.
4,great stair mats - little adhesive on the back,First it took over a month for me to receive these. There are very thin strips of adhesive on the back of these that all have to be peeled off. I have 6 steps so it takes a little while to get the strips off - and sometimes the adhesive will not stay. I did not expect these mats to stick - but actually they have and are exactly what I needed to keep the steps from being so slippery.
4,thickness,i bought these for my parents to help alittle with slippery stepsthey do help but would be better if they were alittle thicker
2,pretty but slips on wood,"really don't want to nail holes in my steps so can't use these since they slip on wood. in the picture, they're on brick, so I'm assuming those people lucky enough to have brick stairs will have no problems with these"
2,these are cheap and I'm not impressed at all.,"The seller was great, everything arrived on time. Except there was a label on the packing box that said ""keep refridgerated"", I have no idea what that was all about. These mats are cheap though, I got these to match the doormat outside the front door of my house. They don't stick and they surely cannot be to avoid slipping, they have no texture/anti slip sealant..nothing. Just cheap thin pieces of rubber, next time I'll pay more for something of higher quality. They look ok. I'm just not impressed at all. The only thing I can say that's positive, is that from a distance the design looks pretty."
1,Not what I thought,"These mats have adhesive on the back. I did not see that in the description or would not have purchased them.In the extreme heat in Tucson, they would soon be a mess on the steps of our deck.They were sold by a vendor and I would never deal with them again.The only thing I will order in the future will be the Free books for my Kindle.I am going to donate the mats to a charity."
1,Installation is problem,"The design of this product is attractive and functional, however the glue strips used to install it are cheap and do not work. The glue actually sticks better to the slick paper that covers it in the package than to the rubber mat, which makes removing the paper almost impossible and the glue useless. I finally used 3M brand spray glue to install them. Since they are installed out in the elements, anything less would have been inadequate as well."
3,a lightweight,"After reading the previous review, I purchased this carrier. However, within 20 minutes of being inside, my cat had broken out! Sharp claws made short work of the netting at the opening. However, if you are buying this for a small dog, it would probably be just fine. I like the way it unzips so can be rolled up and put away. I thought maybe I could at least make use of the nice fleece bottom but this carrier is so sturdy, other than the netting, that I couldn't even cut it apart. Neither could I cut off the straps for a possible alternate purpose. It may be just what you need."
2,One Serious Flaw,"This carrier would have been great except for one serious flaw. The 2 metal ""stabilizing bars"" across the top poked through the inside fabric at BOTH ends, creating a dangerous situation, as the bare metal bars stuck out when I unzipped the carrier. The fabric was just too thin and easily punctured by the unprotected ends of the bars. Too bad, because everything else about the bag was fine: size, ease of use, easy to carry. And unfolding into a mat for home use was nice. Manufacturer needs to use a more tightly woven, stronger fabric, AND cover the ends of the bars so there are no cut off edges to poke through fabric. I returned the item and had to go out and purchase a different carrier. (The seller was very cooperative and helpful!)"
2,police officer child siuit,the accessories were missing and my grandson was very disappointed.Tried to resolve problem but was toldit wasn't their problem. Not satisfied at all
4,Stickers on the Binder,"Great Binders.I bought two.BUT, the big 'binder information stickers' on the front of these binders were VERY hard to get off..."
5,awesome!,Great quality. My son felt like a real police man. It exceeded my expectations. Love the accessories and that it was very light weight fabric.
5,FAUX LEATHER 3-RING BINDER,These leather binders are amazing quality. Great binder to store archival photos or data; I am using to preserve Family Tree photos and research data. I would definitely recommend to others.
1,Poor Quality Rivet!,"I ordered two of these photo binders. Both rivets fall out within 2 days, with only 1 inch of photo pages."
5,Perfect,I purchased these binders for the office. They are very stylish! They are much nicer than the usual office store products. I have had more than one person ask where I got them!
1,Missing pieces,"This was my second time buying this police costume for my son. The first time I returned it because it didn't include everything it says it's suppose to; it was missing the cap, plastic baton, handcuffs, radio, badge, and get real gear. Basically all it included was the police jumpsuit and belt. I had hoped it was a mistake and purchased it a second time but I received the same thing. my son was extremely disappointed, I would not recommend buying this product.Jr. Police Officer Kids Costume"
2,Poor product packaging,"I just spent 45 minutes gingerly scraping pieces of the product label from the front of the binder. The glue was much too strong to hold on a temporary label. Otherwise, the binder looks like it is decent quality."
5,Faux Leather 3 Ring Binder,"This is a solidly constructed 3 ring binder. The cover is finished inside and outside, with color-matched overstitching and brass tone metal supports at the corners. The rings close securely and line up properly. We bought this to use where it would be visible to visitors on the open shelving in a multi-use home office/sitting room where office-supply plastic/vinyl binders detracted from the look. This binder looks good next to the books. Exceeds expectations!"
1,Confused,"I am not reviewing the product, but I am commenting on the page. I wanted to learn more about the We R Memory Keepers binder, but the product description is for a child's police costume! Amazon has responded to my email about this, but has yet to resolve the problem after more than a week. Please fix this, so I can be sure of what I may end up buying!"
2,"""Cloud 9"" is offensive if not seen with an open mind.","""Cloud 9"" presents problems and situations that are often not discussed. Such situations are gays, incest, and women's rights. Churchill does a wonderful job at presenting the situations in a non-bias manner. However, many readers do not care about these issues, reguardless of how they are presented."
3,"""Cloud Nine"" an okay book.","Caryl Churchill's ""Cloud Nine"" is an okay book. It has some parts that are a little bit offensive, but most of the stuff I have heard before. It is apparent that the book was written in a different style than most plays. I would not have necessarily read this book unless I had to for a class, but once I read it I found out it was okay."
3,"Shocking, yet a source of great humor","Caryl Churchill's Cloud Nine, explicitly addresses issues that have been a part of our society for years. In ActI, the sexual elements come as a surprise to the reader, due to the misconception that homosexuality, pedophelia, and other such topics did not exist until the 19th century. ActII address the same issues only in a different time period. The same issues are discussed.I felt that the work was worthwhile and that the topics brought to light in it were definataly worth discussing."
4,Real Writing,"Caryl Churchill's play bends the rules of playwriting to come up with something new and fresh. Churchill understands language and characterization and redefines the usage of both in this play. Churchill is a feminist, but her work should be read by men and women. It is perhaps because she is a women that she is able to dispense with(male) playwriting protocol and reinvent the play format. Well done Churchill!"
4,Can a book with an orgy be that bad?,"I have just finished reading Caryl Churchill's infamous play ""Cloud Nine"". I found the book to be an amazing tool to present to the reader those social issues which we have so desperately tried to sweep under the bed. The book is actually a play through which her use of a Brechtian style of theater keeps the reader in a sort of shocked confusion and not very comfortable. At first glance you might say it is vulgar and rude, yet a deeper evaluation proves that this play is an effective tool to dredge up what society has sunk to the bottom of the river."
3,"Brechtian Theater at its' finest, if that is what you like!","This a play that was written to make people feel uncomfortable, and conote one's feelings on issues of sexual orientation. The play was writen to follow Brechtian style of theater. That is, it was written not to entertain, but to force an audience to focus on a political and sociol conflict. The first half of the play was very well done. It rolls, and is moderatly entertaining. But, then it hits the second act, when everything comes to a grinding halt. One must force themselves to read the on to finish. This is the effect of the Brechtian theater."
3,Shin support,"I bought these because they're blue (vs. flesh colored or white). It's one size fits all and they feel a bit loose. But there is no way to adjust them as there are no straps. They also don't breathe at all (made of neoprene I think). On the plus side, they do work."
5,Not a review...,"This is the story.. I saw a copy of this book in my grandmother's possession when I was a wee lad. She told me it was about my great Aunt, I believe, who was a witch and burned at the stake. I'm still trying to find the copy, because they're all out of print. However, I can attest that it is a true story."
5,an intercultural wonder,"Incredible piece of avant garde musical theatre. Best when seen, but great to read and listen to the cd too! Seldom produced, it combines the techniques of Kabuki Theatre with Western Musical Theatre in a way that only Sondheim could conceive."
2,Opens on the end!,"Be sure that you know what you're getting! This is a military style duffel that upens on the end and ties closed rather than having a zipper. It is also 24"" around the circumfance, not from side to side. I was very disapointed in it, I guess that sometimes it's what they don't say that matters most."
5,Sensory Secrets: A Map to Understanding Yourself,"In a perfect world, by the time we reach adulthood, we would have mastered all of the foundational skills described in Sensory Secrets. But the world is not perfect, nor are we. So, while you may read Sensory Secrets to better understand children, by the time you finish the book, you will also better understand yourself. This book will change your perspective on day to day experiences, and offer you solutions to problems you barely realized were there."
5,Grandmother's point of view,I was glad to read what Catherine writes about what we can do to help children to be happy and healthy and learn better. I will use the ideas that she presented and I will share the information with my family and friends.
5,Sensory explained,This is an amazing book. Step by step it walks you through all the senses in all their forms. It tells you about what deficits look like and how to correct them. I got extra copies for my friends at school. If you work with children that have any sort of sensory integration problems this is the definitive book to have.
1,Sensory Secrets is a Dud,"This book was not at all helpful if you have a baseline knowledge of Disorder of Sensory Integration (DSI), and are trying to learn more about it.I was very disappointed with this book, it added nothing to my knowledge base of DSI.If you have read the out-of-sync child, this book will add nothing to your knowledge base. If you have not read Out-of-sync, than this book *might* be a good starting point. If you have a special needs child, skip this book and go directly to the Out-of-sync child book."
3,Good for students,"This little booklet says for children, but the content is more for teens who might be offended by the ""for children"" in the title."
4,Cute,"My Heart - Christ's Home: Retold for Children by Robert Boyd Munger is a beautiful children's book. It explains quite easily to a younger person what it means to have Christ in your life. The illustrations are great and help to tell the story. I think it was a little mature for Callan, but he enjoyed it because it was Mama & Callan Time together. I will save this book and read it to the kids when they are older, and I am sure it will open up the door for some discussions. Great book."
5,On Target for Children,"This booklet was perfect for using in our prayer room at church. We conducted a 4-day prayer vigil for students returning to school and had stations throughout the room offering opportunities of prayer for many age groups. ""My Heart, Christ's Home: Retold for Children"" was used on our salvation station which portrayed Jesus knocking on the door of our heart. It fit perfectly for a clear understanding by children of this process of receiving Jesus into their heart.We will probably order more copies for later uses."
5,"Spike ""ROXs""","We thing Spike In The City is a very good book for kids because all kids like adventures and this book is one big one. Ms. Bogan put a lot of detail in to this book and she put a lot of time into her pictures. Spike In The City is written so well that it makes you want to read on and on. So, check out your local library and read this and the rest of the series."
3,Poor Spike,"This book's cartoon illustrations of a country dog's mishaps in the big city are funny, but I found this one to be a less satisfying story overall than the first ""Spike"" book by Bogan. Spike and his owner Shannon spend a day in the city, where Spike is roundly ignored by snooty dogs and cats, steps in gum, gets splashed by passing trucks, and generally gets in a mess. However, the love of his owner recalls Spike to good humor. I found this ending a little contrived and lacking the power that a similar message dealt when delivered in ""Spike."" Structurally, I get the feeling that the book is kind of rambling, and it repeats the gag of Spike being ignored by other creatures unnecessarily. There's not much story here except a dog bumbling around, which is good for some giggles at any rate."
3,Feel,"The strings have good feel. That's what I've liked the Gamma strings for. They last long, too, but then, I am a huge topspinner."
4,'the Real' title: An Introduction to Zizek,"I didn't give this book five stars because I didn't feel I knew Lacan much better after reading it. Granted, there were a few memorable moments of Lacanian interpretation, but now that I look back on it, they were only enlightening because of background information I had from better introductory texts. Fink's 'Clinical Introduction,' and 'Lacanian Subject,' are better for a base understanding of Lacan. Overall, I felt the book was worth the read, because it was Zizek after all.. I enjoyed a lot of the literature interpretations he included, as well as film analysis. Like other reviewers have commented, this is more Zizek in here than Lacan, and this was part of the reason I decided to read this. However, I felt the overall format of the book- divided by Lacanian theoretical points- did not help the reader's already difficult task of trying to keep track of Zizek's often scattered arguments."
2,It broke,Well my daughter and myself used it and we were having a lot of fun but without touching it. It broke from the bottom the base wholes a lot of water and it just could not hold anymore. So it leaked. The base should be a lot stronger but we did have a good time using even though it was for a short period of time...
4,Hours of water filled fun,"My kids are 2, 4 and 5 and they LOVE this. They have had it for about a month and spend hours of fun playing with it each time we turn it on. If you only fill the bottom as much as it reasonably can hold, and it does a great job keeping the tower upright, even when it is boxed, punched, knocked over as they tried to ""jump"" it. I had to refill the air a touch each time we used it, but I blame the California sun for that as much as anything."
2,I don't understand all the glowing reviews,"I found this book to be at the most a 2.5 star read.*** SPOILER ***The plot is predictable as can be, right down to the 'you almost died, so now I need to confess my love for you' final chapter. The characters seem like nice people, but they stay stuck in the same antagonistic phase of their relationship for way too much of the book. And in between bouts of their hot/cold/hot/cold emotional roller coaster ride, the physical side of their interaction is awkward, crass, and not a very convincing sell."
3,A different take on the mail-order bride,"Actually closer to 3.5 stars, this is a pleasant historical romance about redeeming love. Abby Smyth made the mistake of her life eight years before. She'd fallen in love with a young lawyer she met through her uncle. Douglas Edmondson, had a poet's heart and a gift for words that made her knees go weak, but love had not been what he was after. Abby learned of his shallow heart too late and in the end he made a fool out of her.Matthias Barrington moved to Montana with his one true love and wife, Elise. While giving birth to their third child she and the baby died. Heavy of heart, he thought there was no way he could open his life again to another.Unaware, several townsfolk decide to play matchmaker and write letters to Abby pretending to be Matthias. ""He"" asks to marry her and sends her money to come to his homestead. Misunderstandings aside, she slowly breaks the prison that surrounds his heart."
4,Pleasant surprise,I bought this book on a whim and it surprised me how much I liked it. The female lead had gumption and wasn't afraid to go after what she wanted. The story had a nice pace without being long and drawn out.
3,"Great story, but too many dead ends","I truly did enjoy the places and people and all the time and trouble building the characters. They were all quite nicely developed. But there's almost always a but, and here comes mine. The book was much shorter than I had expected after paying what I consider ""top dollar"" for this type of read, so not a very good value. There also seemed to be a lot of missed opportunities. Why spend time teaching someone to shoot a gun if nothing exciting is going to happen? Why not have the haters do something hateful? I was expecting more from this author and from the amazing beginning of the story. The ending was a rather bland, uneventful let down for me. Many will enjoy this book, however I would not recommend to my friends."
4,great book,"i find that most jewelry books dont have enough pictures, this is an exception, great photographs and detais for the experienced to the beginner"
5,Best ever!,"I am an American who cooks for my Indian husband, and I've tried several cookbooks. This is the best--easy, and uses the same basic 10 spices so you don't have to go out and buy all sorts of spices you've never heard of.I wore out my first copy, and I seriously had to buy another!"
5,Great taste w/out the extra calories,"New Indian Home Cooking is a winner!!! Have prepared at least half of the recipes and there is not a bad one in the bunch. I was fortunate enough to take a cooking class from Madhu Gadia - well after I had purchased her book - and she was delightful. Once you purchase the spices, which are very inexpensive, you are in business. Cannot go wrong with this purchase!!"
5,Fabulous!!!!,"This is an great cookbook that combines fabulous recipes with easy to follow directions. Every recipe I have tried has been amazingly good. I love Indian food, and although I have other Indian food cookbooks, this is the one I return to again and again. I can find most of the spices I need in Maine at local organic food co-ops (where the prices are considerably less than the grocery stores), but have also gotten some in New York City at Sinha Trading Co, 121 Lexington Ave (212) 683-4419. They will ship."
4,"Great book for big families, not great for singles","I purchased this book because of the rave reviews and I do like it. I liked reading about the history of Indian cooking, even though 55 pages seemed a bit much.The only negative is that I am cooking for myself, and all the recepies seem layed out for big families. Three pounds of chicken? I would have to eat the same thing for a month! If I was a more experienced Indian cook, maybe I could figure out how to reduce the amount, but as a beginner I like to stick to the recipe at the beginning.If you are single, buy a book that maybe cooks for smaller portions, not to serve 6."
2,Not worth much,"The earrings are small little peace for everyday wear.I bought the earrings when I saw discount of 98 %,I thought they will be good piece of jewellery, in fact they do not worth more than 500 $."
5,Awesome,"Awesome. Great guitar, vocals and well, all of it is good. Leave Me with Something has a video on youtube...nice. I Don't mind livin alone neither."
3,"One of the best books ever, but","I would of given this book a five star rating. The incest disgusted me. It was also completely pointless. I have no problems hating a character (Felix) but at the end, I don't find it at all believable, when they share their little laugh. If this really happened, (what Felix did to Mildmay) that person would of been pissed out of his mind."
1,Poor quality,"This futon had 12 holes not drilled, glue on it, a big blue stamp on the wood that said seconds, and a lumpy mattress that was not nearly nine inches. If I did not have company coming I would return it, but unfortunately Im in a pinch. It took hours to put together and sawdust was everywhere from all the drilling that someone forgot to do and oh... i had to be sure the big blue seconds lumber stamp was on the back. Dont waste your money on this piece."
5,Love this book!,"Wonderful books, filled with great historical detail and texture. But aside from historical accuracy, the emotionally authentic portrayal of the post-traumatic stress consequences of war is profound."
5,Perfect...,"There are a few recordings that I like to refer to as my ""cigar"" music, this is indeed one of them, perfect for late night sitting on my balcony with a good cigar. Tune after tune, a homerun!! I like to load them in the player and program them in a random order."
4,informative,"My kindergarten granddaughter wanted to know more about light. I just happened to be doing a unit on night/day at school We read this togther and she was interested. definitely has to be a read aloud for kindergarteners. But, it introduces light sources well."
2,Does not work well with Mac,"I bought this HD for my iMac. I am a little disappointed. It was easy enough to setup and partition but, it fails 90% of the time when using ""Time Machine"". I have to manually back up. I called Seagate and they said they do not support their products when partitioned for PC and Mac and that this was the reason for the failure. However, I had the same issue before adding the PC partition. Do you homework before buying this item, I think there are much better drives out there for the money."
3,so far so good,the setup was a round-about. the inadequate booklet does not describe that you need to set up the hard drive in the macs' disc utility and i had to utilize the online trouble shooting in order to get the hard drive to work on the mac. The mac will not be able to utilize the drive until you do this. the manual should assume little to no computer maintenance experience and explain this. do your research in advance and do not expect to have it up and running quickly if you are not familiar with the inner workings. doable for the average user but takes some work.
1,Failed two hours out of the box,"Very disappointed with this purchase(return).Setup was a snap, but it quit on me while backing up 120 gigs of data. I tried a smaller backup (1.2 gigs) and the drive failed on 99% of the backup... then it just quit all together and was not recognized by my Mac.Disk verification and repair (on my Mac) both showed errors on the Seagate drive that were unfixable."
4,It's so freaking bright,"I haven't had much of a chance to test it out yet. A hard drive is a hard drive. My biggest issue is with the light they decided this hard drive needed. I have an older Seagate external that I've been happy with, so I decided to buy a new Seagate. The old one had a bright blue LED indicator on the power button and that was it. I covered it with some electrical tape, problem solved. This new one lights up on the front, back, and the top. And not just a little LED indicator.. it's a nightlight, casting a dim light on everything in my room. Why do I need such a bright indicator that my external hard drive is turned on? I'd rather just check in Finder.So the nice metallic case is now covered in duct tape to block out the light. Seagate, maybe next time, just go with a dim LED? Or some sort of switch for us people who don't care."
1,Defective power switch and poor customer service,"I have three Seagate 200GB pushbutton backup drives and wanted to add more storage. They had cancelled the stackable series that I already had to make way for the Freeagent Pro series. I bought the 500GB Freeagent Pro to hook up to my mac by Firewire 400. When it arrived the ""on"" switch didn't work. I troubleshooted it and sent it back to Amazon for replacement(they were great about the return). The second one arrived with the same problem. I emailed and left problem tickets with Seagate. It took them 7 days to generate a human response. It wasn't even helpful or accurate. I called Seagate and they weren't able to help over two phone calls from their ""offshore"" customer service. The third call got pushed up to the US. They told me that it was a hardware problem and assured me that the ""third would be the charm."" I think that after 10+ years, I may be done with Seagate alltogether. Too bad!"
2,Defective,"Looks great on paper--triple interface, respectable response time--if only is wasn't defective. FreeAgent Utility IDs it as defective--with RMA info, without any further explanation of why this is so. 1st hard drive I've owned--internal or external--that's defective out of the box.HD Tach reports absurdly slow stats--eSATA, Firewire (OK, 1394 in Windows-land)--no significant difference. So buyer beware, this ""premium"" priced external drive is only worth considering if it actually works. It doesn't, and to say I hate returning defective merchandise is an understatement."
1,OK drive but eSATA is a joke .,"I bought this drive mainly due to the eSATA connection option.What a joke.3mbs transfer rate when connected eSATA.USB was much better @ 23mbs & Firewire clocked in @ 34mbs !Not awesome but at least reaching about 60% of internal speed.The backup software works... 12.5 hours to back up 50mb of data !This was my second Freeagent Pro drive. The first had to be returned because both eSATA & Firewire failed within the first several minutes.I first contacted Seagate support. They responded about 3 days later that they would gladly replace my brand new drive, with a refurb unit ! Add to that the cost shipping both ways and up to 3 months processing time,,, forget it...I then contacted the company I purchased it from, they paid shipping both ways & I recieved a brand new replacement drive withing 2 weeks.So far the new drive is working OK.Conclusion:I would not recommend this drive to anyone, especially if you intend to use eSATA ."
1,Don't purchase this drive,This drive stalled on me in under 6 months. I had to return it to the company and they didn't save it just sent it back.
2,Flakey with Mac G5,This drive is very unstable with my G5. There were problems with file transfers and it would constantly disappear from my desktop. I've had no problems with Lacie or OWC.
1,Horrible,"The firewire port stopped working after one day. Won't even turn on, just terrible. The power switch is cool if it would work. Just say no to the free agent pro"
1,Terrible Product,"I bought this product following a friend's recommendation who had read a glowing review in one of the PC magazines. I had installed it a month ago and now Windows (Vista Premium) does not recognize the drive. It used to recognize the drive when it was first installed, but for some reason it has now ceased to. I have been using the USB connection. Contrary to the claims, the back up process is neither user friendly nor intuitive as claimed on the packaging. And to worsen matters, I did not even realize that there was on an on/off switch on this device - blame it on the very sparse documentation. When I did finally discover the on/off switch, (that switch is embedded in the metal casing) I found out that it requires considerable pressure to be turned on or off.In retrospect, I would have been better off just buying an external hard disk and using Windows' in-built back-up software rather than plunking down $200.00 for this poorly designed but creatively marketed device"
2,eSata is broken,"The USB interface works great. However, if I use the eSATA interface it will completely lock up my system. It locks it up so badly that I can't even Ctl+Alt+Delete. When I unplug it, it immediately fixes the system freeze up. In Googling this, it seems to be a rather wide spread problem. Unfortunately, Seagate just doesn't seem to care. They are consistently removing postings on their own forums when people complain about this issue."
5,Unique Auto Backup,"The Seagate FreeAgent Pro 500 is very easy to setup. The most exciting aspect of its operation is the Auto Backup feature of the software. After the initial complete backup of whatever files you designate, individual files are backed-up when they are modified. There are no ""scheduled"" backups."
1,Can't believe this still has a decent rating... it shouldn't!,"Nobody wants to have a backup device they can't trust. The issues people are reporting are real. Avoid this product. The static switch stops working. The eSata is a nice feature, but they need to document the trade-offs to using it. You really need to have AHCI or RAID, the Intel Matrix Storage Manager, installed BEFORE you install the OS. You will have to re-install the OS if you want this device to work using eSata. This is due to the fact that eSata doesn't support hot-swapping (or unplugging) like a USB external hard drive does. If you want to turn the device on and use it, turn it off and then unplug it using eSata, you MUST reinstall the OS with the AHCI or RAID option (in your BIOS) turned on. Otherwise the unit is ""always on"" and cannot be turned off (it refuses to be be turned off by the switch). It gets really hot!"
2,POG - Good as long as it lasted,"And it lasted a little less than 5 months. It was working fine yesterday, today my computer(s) don't recognize the drive. A lot of researching and solutions on the net hasn't worked so far. While it has a 5 year warranty, it might be replaced with a refurbished one with a 90 day warranty, beware! Yes, it looks cool, has lot of storage at a reasonable price - that's what I thought when I bought it. I read these drives have had a lot of problems, might be the reason why I got them at a hundred bucks months ago! When you loose hundreds of gigabytes of data, there is no point in listing it's pros. For me it is a POG - piece of garbage, right now."
3,Sesgate External Hard Drive,"Works great after I figured out how to use it, the only thing is you have to it turn off before turning off your computer or you lose your new backups.The more I use it the better I like it."
4,Not bad,"Works well, and looks nice. I wish you didn't have to swap the interface on the bottom for USB and Firewire, but that's a minor gripe. The only thing that I really don't like is the power switch. Looks cool, but is a PITA to use."
2,Not as happy as I should be,"Good product, well reviewed, good price, runs quiet..........howevermy drive would power up and shut down repeatedly. Never got my computer to recognize the device because it wouldn't stay powered up. After an hour on the phone with tech support they told me to mail it back with a website to give me a pre- printed return address label. That's all cool, but in the fine print, your mailing cost to send it back is on the buyer and the returned unit will still have the 5 yr warranty but may be factory reconditioned. Hard to feel good about paying an extra $10 to ship and getting a less than new device!"
2,So Not Reliable!,"I've had this hard drive since November 2008. It ran very well up until a month ago. It's very quirky and unreliable as to if your data is in tact. It has a tendency to not respond to deleting or adding files, it gives errors for no reason. Sometimes it doesn't even mount or recognize ANY files on it!And now that I see it sells for only $90 now versus the $130 I paid just 4 months ago really frustrates me.I would stick with Maxtor products even though I had one die on me...which I know any will do after time.I would NOT recommend buying this product no matter how little you pay for it. Why risk data loss?"
2,Very sleek and seems easy to use; stopped working in two months,"I bought this external hard drive to back up my Mac laptop. It is sleek looking and seemed very easy to set up and use. However, after a couple months, it could no longer ""mount"" on the computer. We followed all the troubleshooting instructions on the Seagate Web site and have determined that it is physically defective. I am now trying to work with Seagate to exchange it - a very inconvenient process. I suggest looking elsewhere for an external hard drive."
5,Seagate FreeAgent,This thing works amazingly well. It's just what I needed to store all my pictures and videos.
4,Great Old School Kung Fu Movie,The movie also known as the Strike of the Mantis. It stars Lung Fei as the main villian. A young man who is accident prone works as a servant for a Big Boss who is evil. The young man falls for a noodle girl who along with her father are Mantis fist experts and also know Eagle Claw style. The young man is a favorite of the Evil Big Boss and starts learning the Big Boss's dreaded Chicken Fist. The noodle girl and her father alert the young man of the evils that the Big Boss has committed. The young man then turns against the Big Boss and trains in the Mantis Fist with the noodle girl and her father and all three must in the end face the Big Boss in combat. A great movie again a definate must for those who like animal style kung fu movies.
4,A gripping read,"This book was comforting to read as I was dealing my own manic family member. It's hard to be around someone you love when they are not themselves anymore and for the most part, the author was spared that nightmare. Her husband took off on his own and she saw him sporadically.This book is the true story of everything going wrong with deadly results, and the lessons that the survivors took away from it. Everyone's situation is unique and the story is certainly not a how-to guide for families with a bipolar in their clan. I recommend this book as supplemental reading but not as the ONLY book you read about manic episodes."
5,Good Read,"This book helped me to understand, and how to cope with a best friend's manic episode. Very insightful. It talked about many situations that have occurred with my friend. It helped me to see the other side of darkness in my otherwise bright world."
1,Unwatchable,"Im writing this review as this movie is playing infront of me right now, my wife wants to see how it ends, but i lost interest after only 10 minutes.I was put off immediately by it's low budget, which is obvious from the moment the movie starts, bad actors, bad lighting, bad direction, bad everything.Horror ? really ? not even a bit scary.the plot might have been interesting, i mean it seemed like a good idea, but the excusion was terrible.i just can't watch this, and i can't believe so many actually liked it in here.im going to convince my wife to turn it off and watch something else, i advice all of you who are reading this to also watch something else, I don't recommend this at all.some good Horror i would recommend :28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition),28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition),The Descent (Original Unrated Cut) [Widescreen Edition] andThe Fourth Kind"
2,Just too silly and predictable.,"I love horror films, but I'm weary of formulas. Use your heads give us true suspense and originality."
4,Hits the nooks & crannies.,"This reader looked thru oodles of travel books for information for the ""remote"" places of England vs. the typical visiting grounds like London & Bath. Key elements looked for were: concise transportation prices/options (especially on the railways & bus) , detailed regional maps, and alternate information places to contact (e.g. Dept. of transportation in Brighton, or Tourist info. on the Isle of Wight). This reader was not interested in finding the best place to stay -- but would respond in saying that this information was ""broad"" compared to a Frommers or Michelan vesions of text. This book's material filled in several holes that other travel books with pretty pictures and fluffy text could not. Bully for that!"
4,"Decent, but Joe is better these days","Ive been a fan of Rogan and his comedy for years. This show was filmed in Austin Texas in early 2001. Joe is funny in this but the sound/camera quality are soso (sorry Kevin Booth, I love your films but you were slackin here).If youre a big Joe Rogan fan pick this up, but if youre new to his standup start off getting his specials ""Joe Rogan Live"" and ""Talking Monkeys In Space"". And if you STILL can't get enough of Joe Rogan be sure to check out his podcast at joerogan.net and itunes, its very funny stuff.JOEY DIAZ FOR PRESIDENT 2012! :)Peace Biznatches!"
2,Caution: Mistake,"I got this CD specifically for the song ""I'm Going Upside Your Head"", which is listed as track #15 on CD 2. This song by Jimmy Reed is hard to find except on multi-disc boxes, which are generally more JR than anyone needs, since JR's sound and songs really do become quite repetitive from one track to another. Only problem is that track #15 on CD 2 is NOT ""I'm Going Upside Your Head"" -- it's something else, not very good. A major disappointment! The rest of the 2 CDs are as listed, and do include most of JR's best known numbers. So if you don't particularly mind not having ""I'm Going Upside Your Head"", this collection is really pretty good (4 stars). Again, if you don't mind not having the song mentioned here, the single disc collection on Rhino (""Blues Masters: The Very Best of Jimmy Reed"") is really your best bet (5 stars)."
2,intriguing... but difficult to believe,"Realms creates an intriguing visions of the future of warfare... cybernauts raised from infancy in a virtual world designed specifically to breed uber-tacticians. Believable enough, but from there on the suspension of disbelief becomes a little more challenging. For example, despite somewhat limited use of their muscles throughout their lives - and having only lived in a very controled & sterile environment, on emergence into the real world they're much stronger and faster than your average highly trained commando who was born and raised in the harshness of our reality. Uh huh, I not so sure about that."
1,Where's the specs.,"I'd be interested in this lamp if I could find out something about it like:How tall is it?What kind of light bulb does it take?Wattage?Is it variable, 3 way, What?How can you expect somebody to buy it without knowing anything about it?"
2,Books,"I bought this book because I was collecting Hayley Mills memorabilia....big mistake! No problem with thebook, the shipper, or the shipper just was not was I was looking for. ha!"
1,Doesn't compare to the book!,"If you loved the book, then you'll probably hate the movie. They changed pretty much all the details and the acting sucked."
1,"Read the Book, Skip the Movie","How could you take such an excellent book and rewrite the entire thing, changing the moods, relationships and basically, the entire plot, save the imaginery friend? Who would take such wonderful dialogue and narration of the book and replace it with a Hallmark Channel chick flick? This should've had the feel of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" about a halfway frumpy girl who lives in the shadow of her mother, then reaffirms who she really is with the help of her best friend from childhood. And it was supposed to be a romantic comedy. This has little to no comedy and the lead character is at times creepy. She was supposed to welcome him, not think he's stalking her and threaten to mace him. The movie is ho-hum. Read the book and enjoy at for what it was supposed to be."
5,Like a candy bar,"This movie is not the most realistic, but it is like a great candy bar, soft and sweet and you just devour it. I really really enjoyed it. Lots of beautiful people in heart tugging scenarios, more than decent acting, and pure enjoyment delivered."
2,Didn't do the book justice,"I liked the book a lot. The story was beautiful. But this movie didn't do the book justice. Not only the story about the imaginary friend was wrong (he stays at a constant age), and the actress who portrays the mom character was a bad choice... The character in the book was much better!"
5,I Love It,I love this movie. So I already saw it before I downloaded it to my Kindle. A Must See. Yes.
3,"A sweet, but slightly creepy take on love","This movie is cute, but my main issue with it is that it's kind of creepy. When Michael comes back as a human adult, and he can't let go of the little girl he knew, it comes across as weird instead of endearing. And when the leads finally get together, there is chemistry but there is still this nagging part that says that this is really weird. Not a terrible movie, but by no means great, and kind of offputting."
4,Strong Cover and Too Many Mixes,"If you liked Erin's version of THE FLAME get ready to love her new version of the rock classic DREAM WEAVER. There are ten remixes of the song on this CD, which seems a little excessive since none of them differ dramatically enough from each other that we NEED all of them. Still, it's a very nice song and a great dance tune."
1,Why does this cost 6 dollars?,"I don't understand why this costs six dollars. It's not the full book; it's just some information about the organization and making of the book. This should be available for free, or 25 cents at the most."
3,Walt Disney trip a Success,"This was nice but we had the full guide ,it had rated the food places perfect.it was better to use the full guide."
5,Birnbaum's Walt Disney World Dining Guide 2006,Great book to purchase. Outlines all of the resturants. A most have if planning a trip to Disney.
5,Almost like being there,"I thought this DVD was a great one. It was almost like being there in person. I like being able to watch my favorites sing, so this fit just right. Worth the money!"
3,this dvd is a disappointment,"I was anticipating the energy and charisma of a Live Journey concert. I couldn't find it anywhere on the DVD. Every song on the DVD was performed at what seems 1 1/2 speed. It seems the band was trying to quickly get through the hits that the fans came to see. There is little to enjoy as the band seems to not be having a good time performing their songs together. Play Stone In Love or Who's Crying Now and see for yourself how quickly they go from the intro to the end. This DVD is disappointing. Although Steve Perry produced this DVD, in no way is this a 5 star DVD."
3,Good Group,"The concert is very old, so the sound isn't good. Lights and special effects on stage almost doesn't exist. Of course the songs are excellent and Journey is one of the best 80's group."
1,Boring and Poorly Done,"I have been an avid fan of Journey since way back, but I expected more than a compilation nothing short of a bunch of YouTube videos that had been placed on a DVD and put up for sale. If I were given this DVD by someone as a gift, I wouldn't even feel right giving to someone else I disliked it that much. Very poor quality and not worth buying at any price!"
5,As advertised in the Journey Back Talk Forums...,Here it is. The Journey Houston 1981 DVD from the MTV coverage of the Escape Tour. It is the long awaited holy grail of Journey concerts on DVD. And it has been enhanced with a new stereo mix and 5.1 channel sound by Steve Perry and Allen Sides. Not only did we receive a great new DVD from these masters but we also get a great CD for the car. It is awesome. It is the concert DVD and CD that I have been counting down the days to on the Journey Back Talk Forums [...] since the beginning of the month. It is awesome. If you are a Journey fan you will not be disappointed. If you are not a big Journey fan we might convert you with this DVD. ~ JourneyRocks/ThisMusicRocks - Ken ~
4,satisfiying and fun,"this dvd i bought to give as a present. and i am happy to tell you that we thoroughly enjoyed watching this concert dvd. this band has wonderful stage presence and really aims to please their fans, they sang songs we were familiar with and liked. And, the sound was great. The show looked like something we would have liked to go see in person."
4,Journey DVD,My husband and I have a wide collection of Live concerts. Journey DVD was tha last we ordered and fullfilled our expectations.
2,VBHS??,"I love Journey, and this was my favorite album. The album is awesome but this ""DVD"" is of terrible quality. Felt like I was watching VHS!"
4,Brought back memories,"Though the technology was not as spectacular back then as it is today, it was a very enjoyable, nostalgic concert that reinforces there is no one that can replace Steve Perry!!!!!"
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable - WOW,"This is a joy to watch for any Journey fan. I never had the privilege to see them perform live in concert. This is the next best thing - it is excellent. Steve Perry has, in my opinion, one of the best voices ever in rock and it was wonderful to watch him sing and work the stage along with the rest of the group. The sound is great. Take a trip back to 1981 and enjoy the show."
5,A FUN JOURNEY,"The quality of this DVD is exceptional. This concert, filmed in 1981, is a timeless classic. The surprise was to find it brand new at a very low price. Listening to the music and vocals, along with excellent video, is like a second chance to be there in person, in Houston in 1981.Some of Journey's best songs are included, sung by Steve Perry, such as: Who's Cryin'Now, Don't Stop Believin' and Anyway You Want It."
4,"Journey - Live in Houston 1981, The Escape Tour",This DVD clearly shows why Journey was one of the top arena bands during this time period. The music from The Escape Album was pretty inovative for its time. The band tore the roof off the arena in Houston. Too bad Steve Perry still isn't with the group as he made Journey.
5,Unbelievable,"This DVD+CD set of Journey live in Houston 1981 is simple the most unbelievable concert DVD ever!!! This is the band as Journey was meant to be experienced in 5.1 Dolby Stereo Surround Sound. What can I say about this group that has not already been said. Steve Perry is the BEST vocal performer and there is NONE that compare to him, he is The Voice. Neal is a total master of the guitar. Smitty is the ""Machine Gun"" like no other. Ross is great bass player. Jon is the keyboard master. The production on the DVD and CD is set top notch. You will enjoy listening to this again and again of the greatest band ever."
4,Journey - Live In Houston 1981 Review,If you like Journey especially the Escape album you will enjoy this concert DVD. Sound and visual good.
5,Journey Rocks....Steve is at his BEST!,Steve was at the top of his GAME on this video.....I love Steve Perry's singing and the group rocked the Summit....I play Journey ALL the Time at my apt.....Steve Perry's soaring voice WAS and ALWAYS will be Journey's swan song....
5,"Well, it's about freakin time!!!!!!","I too had this on video and wore the tape out! This is by far the best example of how great Journey was! I went to the Dallas concert which was 2 days after this particular concert and it was great as well! All of you are right, Journey is not journey without the great Steve Perry! I think he might have kicked up a stir when he appeared at the Chicago White Sox World series game! Hopefully, he will make up with his former bandmates and do a ""real"" reunion tour."
4,Fabulous performance!!!! Excellent quality.,"What can I say, this is awesome. Steve and the boys are in their prime, and their performances are flawless, especially the solos by Smith and Cain. Steve looks hot and I am pleased with the extras, which includes interviews with the band members. Wish the slideshow would have shown more behind the scenes, and that is the only thing that prevents me from giving it a full 5 stars, but other than that, this is a must-have for Journey fans."
2,Why nothing from the series?????,"My heart leapt when I followed a link from an Amazon email to this product. I thought the TV series had F-I-N-A-L-L-y been released. Instead I found this movie, which I remember watching when it aired: thinking it rather lame and wondering where some of the most-loved characters were.Any word on when the series will be released? THAT will be worth buying!"
3,Where is the Box Set?,"When, if ever, are we going to see a Box Set of all thetelevision episodes?What do we have to do to get or encourage one?I want one, and I want it now!"
2,"I'm not a fan of this ""Very Special Reunion""","As other reviewers have previously stated, this wasn't anything special. Like them I really want to see the series released on DVD in a one-time buy package. The issue with this movie is that while it was nice to see Grace and Michael duke it out (which was pretty lame now that I think about it), this movie lacks several cast omissions, especially Jimmy Smits and the entire ommission of Michelle Greene (Abby Perkins), who was always a personal favorite of mine. Reunion specials are fine, but do it for the actual fans of the show who watched it, not to lure new viewers who MAY get they chance to see back episodes and piece it all together. Bochco needs to come off this series as well as Hill Street Blues and let us buy it once and for all."
2,Lame story,"This movie is as bad as the series last 3 seasons. A reunion-movie without Diana Muldaur, Amanda Donohoe, John Spencer and Jimmy Smits - please!"
3,A gift for my mom,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom, as she loved the series and watched re-runs all the time, but had never seen this movie. While we weren't too terribly impressed by the plot, it was nice to be able to revisit the characters."
5,AWESOME LOOKING SET,"Inspired no doubt by Dungeons and Dragons is this magnificent set in Fisher Price's Imaginext line. Dragon keeper Dungeon is home to the terrible fire-breathing, Red Dragon and his Goblin henchman. The set allows you to a variety of different looks to the dungeon with pieces that are interchangeable to get the look you want. Also makes it easier for little ones. The set features various gates and trapdoors that can be opened and closed. The dragon figure is well articulated for posing atop or inside of the dungeon. The dragon can also shoot out fireballs to make him more menacing. Of course the set is compatible witt the other Imaginext sets as well. Contrary to the other reviewer, I've found the set to be quite sturdy and well constructed. Great looking piece!"
2,Stick with Lego or Playmobil,"The pictures and concept are very enticing, but stick to Lego and Playmobil for durability. The Imaginext set we purchased was hard for a 6yr old to assemble. The pieces don't stay together easily, so right now it is in pieces all over the floor. Not much fun for the 6-yr old in the long run and not fun for Mom!!"
2,A little bit of junk,"Maybe in a few years, you'll be able to find ""Mambo #5"" in a CD collection that will include such immortal novelty hits like ""Little Nash Rambler"", ""Alley Oop"", ""Please Mr. Custer"", and ""Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polkadot Bikini"". Right now, I don't see paying premium prices for a song in the same caliber as the ones previously mentioned. This one's going to fall back in the discount rack in no time."
1,"it is all hype, in 2 weeks everyones going to hate this cd","trust me, this is all hype. You going to get pisted everytime you here ""mambo #5"" on the radio in 2 weeks."
5,This CD is da bomb digity. Mambo Number Five.,"A little bit of Monica..... Sorry i just cannot get that song out of my head. This is the best dance CD out there right now. Once you here it once you will be singing it all of the time. Jump up and down. And move it all around. Put your hands to the sky, put your hands to the ground. Take one step left and one step right, one to the front, and one to the side. Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice. If it looks like this then your doing it write. Mambo # 5"
5,Mambo Number 5 BIG HIT!!!!!!,"I love the song Mumbo Number 5. A break out hit for Lou Bega and another I think will be popular is ""I got a Girl"". This hit Mumbo Number 5 will be out on the radio for a long time. I recommend that everyone go out and by this CD because it is worth it. The Mumbo, dance, and hip hop all together make it a smashing hit!! Mumbo Number 5!!!!!"
3,"MAMBO #5 ROCKS, havana club re-mix is terrible!!!","I am the DJ at the Crazy Horse Saloon, in Nevada City, CA. Every time the Mambo #5 in played, the entire place goes into a frenzy. I am not as impressed by the rest of the album, however.WARNING: AVOID THE DANCE REMIX of the Mambo #5 (Havana Club Mix), it is nothing at all like the ""regular"" version: all the great vocals are removed, just a funky beat with the Perez Prado melody line, and an occasional word or two from the song sprinkled in. A huge dissappointment as I was looking forward to having a re-mix to play in the club..."
4,The Entire CD is awesome,This entire CD is filled with fast paced tracks. Each track has the traditional mambo sound buit with a 90's twist courtesy of Lou Bega. If you like to party to music this is a must have.
2,It's nothing but the Mambo,"I don't deny that Mambo #5 has a great beat, but its the only song that has any future. The lyrics could have been written by a 5 year old!""You are my, my, my, my, my number one. You are not my, my, my, my, my number five.""""Baby show me one plus one is two. Show me all the things that you can do!""And I Got A Girl- practially the same as Mambo Number 5, but it starts out ""6, 7, 8, 9, 10....."" same beat on everything!Lou Bega has one great song, but the rest is absolutely hysterical in that he thinks that anyone will listen to this!"
5,mumbo number 5,this cds of lou bega is funny and hip too the max I like mumbo number 5 and tricky tricky.
1,The Trend Is Dead!!,"I can almost forgive this guy for creating an album's worth of brainless novelty numbers, but I'm not too sure that I'll ever be able to forgive him for the damage done by ""Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit of...)"". This dopey song burrowed its way into my brain (and probably yours, too) and drove me crazy for almost two months. Thank God, the rest of the CD is nowhere near as infectious, but just as stupid. Now I guess we'll have to put up with hearing this song at weddings for the rest of our lives. C+ Tom Ryan"
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD. I love the Mambo-sound. Its got a great beat. My favs are Mambo#5, I got a Girl, and 1+1=2. If the whole CD were like those three songs, it would be the best CD I have in my set."
2,So absurd I like it,"This is one of the most absurd albums I've ever laid ears on. A full 3 tracks on this thing sound so much like mambo #5 that you can sing mambo #5 along to them. It's like they whipped up this album so they could release the song. Which is usually a bad thing. But in this case, it's so over the top I think it's funny to listen to! It's absurd-- it's like a joke! Artistically, the album is weak, but it's funny and bouncy and catchy."
1,I did not like this CD.,I thought this CD was awful! The only decent song on the entire CD was Mambo No. 5. I wouldn't buy this CD before listening to it first or else you will end up regreting buying it like I did.
1,Move over Ricky Martin!,"SNIFF... SNIFF... This one smells like ""one hit wonder"" all the way! Better reduce the payroll on your posse and sell the race horses, because next year this time there will be another Lou Bega in your place exploiting today's children's ""buy my love, Daddy"" attitude.Say Hi to Hammer when you see him in the welfare line..."
5,Lou Bega Rocks!,"I love Mambo #5 by Lou Bega! A little bit of Monica in my life, A little bit Erica by my side, A little bit of Rita all I need, A little bit of Tina what see, A little bit of Sandra in the sun, A little bit of Mary all night long, A little bit of Jessica here I am, A little bit of you makes me your man. My other favorite part- Jump up and down and move it all around , shake your head to the side put your hands on the ground, take one step left, one step right,and one to the front and one to the side, clap your hands once, clap your hands twice, and if it looks like this than your doing it right! Thanks for reading!"
4,Pretty good,This cd was good. Most of the songs are good but some of the songs could use a little help. Mambo no.5 is a great song. But track 2 is not very good. I think this is a good cd.
2,Only one good song,"Mambo No. 5 is the only good song. The rest of them are terrible! They're all about how he has tons of girlfriends, and how much of a womanizer he is!"
1,Trash,"This is throw-away, trashy pop of the worst variety. If you're a pre-teen, consider picking it up - it'll be on your level. Anyone else should avoid this like the plague."
2,just MP3 this junk if you want it,"because THE DEATHSQUAD'S HWANG BLACK SAYS THIS JUST ANOTHER MUSICAL FAD CREATED BY SOME TOP RECORD EXECUTIVES TRYING TO CASH IN ON A PERIOD PIECE WHERE MAMBO-LATIN-DANCE MUSIC IS SELLING MORE THAN EVER. IT'S LOU BEGA THAT'S THE PROBLEM, IT'S JUST REPETITIVE AND AT TIMES NAUESATING DELIVERY ABOUT HIS WOMAN. YEAH, IT CAN BE FUN TO DANCE TO, BUT IF IT'S JUST YOU AND YOUR STEREO, YOU PROBABLY WON'T FIND IT AS FUN. THERE'S A FORMULA FOR THE LOU BEGA'S OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY: 1 BIG HIT, 2 BIG YEARS, AND BYE. BUT, ON A NICER POINT, ""MAMBO MAMBO"" AND ""CAN I TICO TICO YOU"" ARE LOADS OF FUN ON THE DANCEFLOOR WITH YOUR RITA AND ERICA, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS ""MAMBO NO. 5"" WITH A DIFFERENT TITLE. PLEASE SEND DEATHSQUAD FEEDBACK TO tommyfresh@webtv.net."
2,it's ok,"I personally like only number 1, Mambo No. 5. It has a good beat, but the rest I think is pretty boring! If you plan on buying any of Lou Bega's cd's, I recomend the single Mambo No. 5."
2,it's ok,"I personally like only number 1, Mambo No. 5. It has a good beat, but the rest I think is pretty boaring! If you plan on buying any of Lou Bega's cd's, I recomend the single Mambo No. 5."
4,MaMbO sTrIkEs BaCk,"Mambo still lives! When I bought this cd last year I thought it was going to be just another run of the mill pop album. I was suprised to see that it wasn't a pop album but a mambo album. My favorite songs are Mambo #5(A Little Bit Of Mambo), Can I Tico Tico You, Tricky Tricky, and Mambo Mambo. If you ever want to have a good time or throw a party then this is the album to get."
4,A lot of Mambo!,"If you liked Mambo #5,then you will probably like this cd. Almost every song on this Album,sounds like Mambo #5. Thats not really a bad thing,but it gets old quick. 1+1=2,I gotta girl,and The Most expensive girl,all are pretty good,but in someparts they sound so alike,its almost impossible to tell them apart. A Little bit of Mambo,is a descent effort,and at least deserves a listen to."
4,Gets your feet tapping,"Lou Bega really knows how to get the crowd kicking. Though it's true that all the songs have almost the same beat, it's refreshing & one doesn't get tired of listening to them. It's got a pleasant beat & none of the songs are ballads.(that's what i like most about this album)'I got a girl' is a kind of continuation of Mambo no.5. while mambo no.5 starts off like '1..2..3..4..5', I gotta gal goes like '6..7..8..9..10' Can I tico tico you was good too, but as they say they all had almost the same beat. The trumpet was different. It was totally cool. I usually don't like listening just to music, I need lyrics too. But the trumpet was really good. Icecream, was not upto the mark. The others were ok. Not bad. All in all it was a good album. Prospective buyers won't be disappointed."
5,Mambo Some More,"This CD is very fun and exciting. The music envokes fun, movement and laughs. What a feel good way to get into Mambo."
1,Whaste of Money,"I feel sorry for everybody who bought this CD. First of all it has bad lyrics. I mean does anybody care about what his ""girlfirends"" are and what they do? I don't think so. And it is overplayed all the time......don't buy it if you want a good CD."
3,A Little Bit of Mambo Review,Lou bega makes you want to sing and dance along with all of his songs on this cd. Mambo #5 and Tricky Tricky are the best! I recomend this to anyone.
2,"good for kids, I guess","The music is way too ""synthy"" for me. In many cases the ""band"" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box. Many of the lyrics are inane. Lou's voice seems ok. My 8 year old likes it a lot.The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there. I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo. I certeinly wish that I was as studly as he is."
3,I dunno...,"This is 4-star quality but whenever the songs sound the same it ruins it. Mambo No. 5, I Got A Girl, and 1+1=2 all sound the same. Well the other two were much better than Mambo No. 5. The only song I didn't like was Beauty on The TV Screen. It was very slow and he cannot do good at high notes.You should buy it for the positives if so: It's fast. The Most Expensive Girl In The World is the only one not about himself or a girl. It talks about a guy actually. A weird song. You should give credit for having originality. I don't even like Mambo No 5 anymore. Tricky Tricky's also on here, another positive about this album.Maybe when he comes back songs won't sound similar throughout the album."
1,Mambo no. 5 is a No. 1 hit wonder!,"Oh common, can a song have more copies than this! How many times can you here Mambo no. 5? This cd goes on for 13 tracks repeating the same song! I'm warning you: Don't get this cd!"
3,Disappointing...But Not A Disaster,"The catchy song ""Mambo #5"", which some of my friends call ""The Bill Clinton Song"" (quite fittingly) is the best song on this album. That said, this is not a total disaster. I liked ""The Most Expensive Girl In The World"" (as I can imagine many girls at my university like that), and ""Tricky Tricky"" was okay, but ""I Got A Girl"" is a direct rip-off of ""Mambo #5"" and none of the other tracks are all that memorable. This album is a decent, but unspectacular listen."
1,pure torture,"If you want to torture me or anyone with proper taste in music, tie me up and play Mambo no. 5 over and over again. This song and the rest of the material in the cd are trying to take advantage of people who wanted to hear something ""different"" from what's being played nowadays. Reviewers who gave this record five stars are pretty hard up for some real good and fun music."
2,Better if You Have Seen the Videos!,Mambo #5 and I've Got a Girl are the hits. The rest with maybe one or two exceptions are pretty ordinary. Listen to the couple good ones and skip over the rest.
1,Insulting,"Apparently we can expect that every summer we'll be exposed to some lame , semi-ethnic song with shallow lyrics. The sad part is that this is the best song on the record. Does anybody else think that Corona might be putting pressure on radio stations to play this bogus ""summer"" music?"
5,"At last, some class and some back boned beat!!!","Refreshing, hot, a real throw back to a time when music meant to be mood enhancing and to have a BEAT!!!! A good album to add to your "" I Love"" collection. You will always have it in or near your CD player!!!"
1,Terrible,"A cd full of unsatisfactory and empty music. The ""hit"" Mambo no. 5 is especially distasteful."
1,very weak,Lou Bega is a one hit wonder.he seems like a cool dude.but his music and voice are just filler for some behind the scenes Producer trying to ride on the Pop Latin cross-over success.really dinky but typical of the business.
3,Hmmmmmmm!,"This album is overall average. But hell I'd get it for no other reason than MAMBO #5! And I listen to Korn, Beasties, Limp Bizkit, Green Day, Rob Zombie, Sublime, etc! I think the reason we all love Mambo #5 so much is cause its so damn catchy!"
1,misogynist songs,"This cd stinks. It's trite and sexist. I can handle a LITTLE bit of sexism if there's SOMETHING musically to back it up, but there's not here"
2,Only good song is Mambo Number Five,"I like Lou Bega's song Mambo Number Five. It's a great song, so I bought the CD. It starts off well with his #1 pop hit, but after that it took a plunge. All the songs after that are highly annoying pop-dance tunes with basically one line of lyrics that he repeats over and over and over again. I couldn't stand it, even after the second song, ""Baby Keep Smiling."" Ugh. And all the songs are practically about the same thing, some guy who goes out and gets any girl he can for one night. He's a player. If you like Mambo Number Five, get the CD single. Don't buy this album. I regret that I did . . ."
4,this cd is so cool!,"I think this cd is so cool, lou bega's music is very catchy, the rythm, and the lyrics, my favourite song is mambo no. 5, I think it is the best one of his cd, and if you haven't heard it yet, I recommend you to listen to it, because you will love it! , after listening this song for a long time, you can get a little tired of listening to it, and dancing it, but you will love it! =0)"
1,The same rythm and beats throughout the entire cd.,"If you stop and think a little before buying this album, most probably you won't. The entire album sounds the same, very slight differences between Mambo No. 5 and the rest of the songs, and after listening to a song for about 5 times, you actually get pretty sick of it. If you like Mambo No.5, just buy one of the compilation cd's, you will spare listening to a horrible album, and preview some songs of other, probably better, performers."
1,"Original, I think not",I'll give it one star for the one hit (Mambo #5) on this album. I agree with the other reviewer that predicts a one hit wonder. Track number 4 sounds very much like Mambo #5...was Lou running out of ideas already?
3,"Immature, but it will get you moving","Lou Bega's cd is everything it is said-it is sexist and demeaning to women, and it is immature. But, when you get past all that, there is a cool sound behind it that will make you dance, a little at least. If you don't take his lyrics too seriously, you'll enjoy the cd."
4,Bouncy and Fun,"Who cares if this is great music or not or if Lou Bega has a good voice or not? This is playful, fun, bouncy music. It even makes those of us who don't dance feel like shaking it up. I bought this on a whim for one song that I heard in a commercial for a large telecommunications company (1+1=2) and was hoping that wasn't the only good song on the album, as so often happens. It wasn't. The whole album is great fun to listen to. This is music that most everyone can enjoy, with a touch of naughty pleasures. Several songs are about romancing many women at once (specifically Mambo No. 5 and I Got a Girl), so if you have strong moral codes, you might want to steer clear. No filthy lyrics or violence here, so if you teens want to buy this one, I would let them. Just keep in mind, it's not squeeky clean stuff and one or two lines in a couple of songs migh make you blush. Tame in comparison to a lot of the stuff out there."
4,David Blair of North Carolina,"This was a great CD, I really enjoyed it. I first heard it on the radio on sept. 4, it is now sept. 6"
3,"3 AWESOME songs, but that's it","I didn't have high expectations for this album, I bought it because I LOVE ""Mambo #5"", but there are 2 future hits on this album. ""I got a girl"" and ""1+1=2"" are just as HOT as ""#5"". I love the combination of Hip-Hop, Swing, and Mambo, I hope radio plays more of this kind of music."
2,Inept Mambo Music set to brainless scratching,"I can't believe I gave this cd to my girlfriend. What was I thinking? I guess it was ""Mambo No. 5"" that made me get it for her, but now 10 years after I feel I wasted the money. ""Mambo No.5"" is pretty good, but you get tired of it after awhile. I've heard both versions the original, and the one he did for Disney. The rest of this was rather lame with the exception of a couple of tracks. ""I've Got A Girl"", ""The Most Expensive Girl In The World"", and ""Tricky Tricky"" were passible, but the rest of it is junk. I mean he's so unoriginal that he cops the ""Mambo No. 5"" beat for ""1+1=2"". This was good for only one hit, and he had it, so get down to business, and do some real mambo music, or look for another line of work; because this simply won't do."
3,"Fun & Original, but he's very full of himself!","Lou Bega sings pretty good, and every one of these songs has a creative, different, easy-to-dance-to beat. But listen to the lyrics and you'll hear one conceited guy! I mean, he thinks he's got ""a girlfriend everywhere,"" which I seriously doubt, and then there's the other song that makes him sound like a total two-timer when it names all those girls he apparently dates (Erica, Rita, Tina, Sandra, Jessica, YOU! It's like, oh pleeeze! Come ON!) There's another song, too, where he says something like ""the fans are all around me."" Is Lou Bega really obsessed with himself or what? Still, I recommend it because the songs really are fun and original. It's the lyrics that leave something to be desired."
2,Can you say monotony?,"Unreal. A big scam. A one star if it wasn't for the song ""Mambo number 5"" sticking in my head and fermenting. Get out your synthisyzer. Press the mambo button. Let the beat play a few bars, and make up a song about how you get all the girls in bed, and you just saved yourself from buying Lou Bega's album! Many songs on this album have the same beat in the background as the catchy ""Mambo number #5."" Only some have even more elementary lyrics than "" a littl' bit o Monica in my life."" If it's Mambo Number 5 you like, may I suggest the imported single. It's got about 5 versions of Mambo Number 5 on it, so you can quickly learn the lyrics and not feel left out when your friends are singing along when it invades the radio again."
4,Feminists leave this guy alone,"This is a great party CD and a refreshing break from the techno and europop dance music that's been saturating the airwaves in recent years. I'm glad some of the older dance music is becoming popular again. And it's NOT sexist, he just likes women. Would you rather him choose male dance partners?"
5,"Exellant, The Best",You will never find a muisic like this with such rytheme in all his traks is is the best buy if you like these kinds of music
4,Mambo Time.,"I gave this CD 4 stars. Mainly because of Mambo #5, which I personally really like. The rest of the songs are nice, and fun to listen too. Nothing too catchy or amazing. Mambo #5 fans should buy this CD because his style shows throughout the entire album. A good addition to mostly anyones collection. A nice buy."
1,"Enjoy your 15 minutes of Mambo fame, Lou!","About every three or four years, some novelty tune or dance craze bubbles to the surface. (Anyone remember all the Acky-Breaky dance videos? I didn't think so.) Though he seems like a nice enough guy, Lou Bega is just the latest in the long line of soon-to-be-trivia-questions sweepstakes. Enjoy the money and the girls, Lou, because if this Mambo-Lite is the best you can do, there's not much future in the music biz."
2,Repetitive,"The first time I heard Mambo No. 5, I fell in love with it. It was catchy, addictive and made me go out and buy the single. The album came out and I really didn't think it was possible.Just as I thought, the songs all sound pretty much the same, eg. the synthesised tamborines and that little yell he uses as his backbeat which is possibly the most repetitive factor of this album.The lyrics of the songs are all the same too, with the lists of women's names and countries just as an example. I'd better end the review here because the word 'repetitive' is getting a wee bit repetitive.Mambo No. 5 was enough."
1,Simply abominable,"Calling this ""the Macarena of 1999"" does a disservice to the Macarena. This is totally devoid of soul and substance, bears no resemblance to anything that could even charitably be called ""mambo"", and is quite possibly the worst record I've heard all year. Buy Beny More' instead- you'll be happy you did."
5,The Soundtrack Of Our Lives!!!!!,"holla!!! this happens to be the greatest cd of all time (sorry bizzkit). everybody knows the mambo song (grartest lyric since every breath you take by p. diddy!!!), but the rest of the cd is off the chain. i haven't heard all of the other songs yet because the mambo (or as we call it at home, ""mo-mo"") is so fantizzle. the other day (saturday) my wife and i were cruisin around the o.c. and our phones went off at the same time. since we both have the mo-mo ringtone, everyone was starin' hard. so to represent, i lifted off my shirt and exposed my ""lil bit o mo-mo"" tattoo located around my pelvic region (like the two t's tommy lee and 2pac). anywayz, everyone started to sing it!!! it was so rad!!! some guy even started beatboxin' to it. for sure!!! so that shows how awesome the mo-mo is. dare i say it-modern day classical music!!!"
2,don't buy the cd,"OKay, first of all he has only 2 good songs of the whole cd, that's why i gave it 2 stars. He has all of his songs sounding the same. They're awful........... So if you listen to these samples you'll see what I mean. Don't waste your money on this cd. Buying singles would be a lot better use of your money......"
2,"Can U Say ""1-Hit Wonder?""","I h8 to admit it, but this album is not good at all. Yeah, Mambo No. 5 was a great song, but it got old fast. The only 2 songs that even attempt 2 save this album r ""Mambo No. 5"" and maybe ""Tricky, Tricky."" So don't be dumb like me and waste your dough on this album. It's mediocre at best."
4,"Latin beats, kikky lyrics and a number 1 single","A very good collection of the mambo king. Mambo no.5 samples a Prez Pardo song, Baby keep smili'n starts off like a 50's 45, Can I tico, tico you is a latino-ish number, I got a girl is simaler to track 1... A very good LP"
3,It's cool,The cd is really cool when you here it a couple time's in a row but when you listen to it after and after you get pretty sick of it and don't want to here it anymore. that is what i think about the cd.tabitha
4,A LITTLE BIT OF...,THIS IS A GOOD CD. THE ONLY GOOD SONG THOUGH IS MAMBO #5. THE REST OF THE SONGS :p (STINK) SO I WOULD RECOMEND JUST GETTING THE SINGLE OF MAMBO #5.
4,LOVE IT!,"If you want to hear a song that makes you want to dance, this one's it! The main reason I bought this CD was that I FINALLY had a song with my name in it! Everyone needs a ""little bit of Monica in your life"" And no, NOT MONICA LEWINSKI! She has given the rest of us a BAD RAP!"
3,"Mambo #5 is a good song, but the others are not","Mambo #5 is a great song, but all the other song titles are not mentionale. The CD has a hit single with a bunch of lame songs to take up space on a CD."
2,too old of music,Actually I was disappointed. Guess I ignored the description and just thought the Neville Bros. actually put out th album in 2011. It was made from old songs from someone who compiled them. Didn't like it.
5,Fantastic,"I love the magazine, and I love the option to get the year's recipes in a hardcover edition... I've never eaten better!"
3,Excalibur King Arthur Electronic chess,"I was a bit disappointed with it. However, my grandchildren seem to like it. I felt given the state of electronics today it is lacking. The LCD screen is very small and hard to read. It is missing voice prompts to tell the moves."
4,Been seen been admired,I thought that this product would be a good fix at work in the cubicle world especially where on-line programs were off-limits by big brother. It gives me a release to be able to play at my intervals and be able to pick the game up where I left off. HIGH FIVE!
4,found treasure,"Jeremy Brett is so wonderful to watch. I addition, I am a huge Ciaran Hinds fan. I bought this series to get an episode he was in. His touching portrail of a wronged sailor In ""the cardboard box"" left me breathless. Sherlock Holms is timeless and I am glad to have this in my library."
4,For the Brett completist,"I've enjoyed many portrayals of Sherlock Holmes. None has delighted me quite as much as Jeremy Brett's. This collection of the final six hour-long episodes from the Granada series are a mixed lot, and they may only be for those of us who MUST own the complete Holmes/Brett DVD library. But there is one absolute gem here, ""The Cardboard Box."" This clever adaptation resets Doyle's classic story during Christmas, and the result is macabre enough to put a grin on the faces of even the gloomiest Sherlockians."
4,Whodunit?,I purchased The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes-No one will ever come close to being the real Sherlock Holmes except Jeremy Brett. Not even Basil Rathbone. What I want to know is how did Jeremy Brett really die? He was only 57 yrs. Come on now. What's the real rest of the story?
3,Had problems in delivery.,"Post office said that it was delivered on saturday, while our office is totally closed on Weekends. So there was no question that it was delivered. When I tried to find out I got no help from postal department. I probed a lot and found out that they delivered it to some other place so I had to workout a bit to get it. So I am a bit scred to purchase from your site now."
1,NOT written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,These are NOT originally written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. These are vague and poor adaptations of the original which come across as cheap plots. These are meant for Jermey Brett fans and not Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fans.
2,Acting Too Extreme,"I just didn't like the portrayal of Holmes in this version. None of the characters came alive for me. I know some really like this one, but I didn't."
5,Jeremy Brett makes it happen ... again,"Even with having had a mental breakdown between the first and second series, Jeremy Brett still portrays the best Sherlock Holmes I have ever seen. As with all the other Jeremy as Holmes collections, this collection is excellent. It has not been that long ago that my wife introduced me to Sherlock Holmes portrayed by Jeremy. I am and have been a fan of the stage. Most popular actors never spend any time on the stage and the lack thereof is evident. It is evident that Jeremy spent a great deal of time on the stage which he successfully brought to the camera."
5,cute cards!,These cards are perfect for any age. Gives you something cute to look at when playing games! I do recommend.
5,Cute!,"These playing cards are so cute. I use them in my work and the children I work with just love them. Makes any card game more fun. Came when they were supposed to with no issues. Really, the most fun playing cards I've ever had."
5,If you love dogs . . .,"These are so cute. My grandson LOVED them, and I have to say that I had fun going through the deck. I don't think you would consider playing bridge, or serious cards with them. They are great for kid's games."
4,Great,This is a great series. The ova's are good too but they are alot different from the anime. It doesn't really feel like Tsubasa at times. It becomes very dark and bloody. Which is alot different from the anime. It's still very good. But I'm still disappointed that it doesn't finish the story. Definitely worth watching because it explains alot.
4,Tsubasa: The Ova Collection was amazing!,"Let the Review Begin I won't spoil anything about it ova how ever I'll give you my opinion I have watch Tsubasa Season 1 If you have bought it And haven't finish season 2 it's ova movie give most a recap of season 2 If you have Tsubasa Season 1&2I recommend it if your a true fan of the series.Also it feel like I was watching a movie if your new to the series.And If your new to the series buy season 1!Why did I Choose this rating? I enjoy the ova I'll watch it ova more then once! Music was great! Awesome Voice Over!What did I like or dislike? I like the story, The advantages all the characters went to I love it! There wasn't any thing to dislikewho would I recommend this product? Fans of the series will enjoy it like I did but Remember Finish Season1 & 2if you didn't you won't understand what happening in the story you'll be very confuse & lost also disappointing"
4,Quick Ship,"This bike is super cute. It's for my 3 year old ""adopted"" daughter who hasn't learned to ride a bike with training wheels yet. I ordered it for Christmas and Amazon was very kind to let me know that Disney's shipping schedule would most likely NOT allow the bike to arrive before Christmas. I thought I would chance it and sure enough the bike shipped within 3 days! Great service from Amazon as always."
1,I give this a B for 'bad product',"I thought it was cute when I seen it online last year. However, this bike is way too hard to paddle for my daughter. Also, the chain pops all the time. Man.... DO NOT GET THIS THING. Let the buyer beware."
5,dynamite guitarist,If you like jazz guitar you will love this. Mr. Bruno may step aside and let the sax and organ solo to much for a video that bares his name but his work here is magic.the set list:Blues WalkOn a Clear DayAngel EyesHave You met Miss JonesSatin DollMy Shining HourDolphin DanceCherokeeAs an extra you get an interview that is aimed at players more than fans.
5,"9 to 90, a hit for all ages","There is something for everyone on this wonderful video. Nostalgia and great music for those of us who grew up in the 60s, yet at the same time good clean entertainment for children, presented in a very positive, thoughtful, loving way. PP and M have aged gracefully and their kind and soft qualities make them great communicators with children, and what's more, while Mary Travers' voice is a bit harsh now, they can still sing and harmonize very very well indeed."
5,Exactly what kids should be watching,"I was just a teenager when this program aired on PBS in 1993. Even at that age I truly enjoyed the music and wonderful performance given by P, P & M. As I was pondering what music from my childhood I wanted to share with my young child, I couldn't help but remember this performance. He is 19 months old and is captivated by the music and childlike emotion of the group. I feel so good about the message sent by this show that I allow him to watch a little almost every day. I know the message sent by their music will inspire and entertain him now and for years to come."
3,Monsieur P. Investigates,"I love the lightness of these little tales; what a refreshing escape. The French setting,the cuisine, Monsieur himself and the intrepid hound Pomme Frites are all delicious."
2,Huge disappointment!,"I read (and loved the halfbreed by bobbi smith) and had greatexpectations from this sequel. It was an enormous let down.Stone and Annie don't grab the reader in and of themselves. The story itself is one continual nothing........waiting for ""pa"" to die...and watching the evil stepmother do her thing. There's no depth to the characters.The ending is anit-climatic and I couldn't wait for the book to end. Enjoy halfbreed but leave this series there. I haven't read Evelyn Rogers much but the writing doesn't , at least in this, match up to the other 3 writers doing this series of books. sorry ms rogers."
2,...,"I wanted to like this book, being the ending to a great series and all, and it was so not worth the money. Like a few other reviewers said, this book was a disappointment.I didn't like Annabelle in the other books, and I didn't like her in this one either. Also, there really wasn't enough information about her or her and Stone's relationship. I felt like it was too rushed and it just didn't feel real or good or worth reading. The scene that is most long-awaited sucked. She suddenly wanted to sleep with him and so she just sneaked into his bed? And was she a virgin or not?This is why I've never liked Evelyn Rogers because she always leaves questions unanswered.By the second half of the book, I was more interested in reading about Clare's comeuppance. But still, it wasn't worth the time."
3,SOMETHING OF A LETDOWN,"I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS SERIES, EACH AUTHOR BROUGHT A DIFFERENT EDGE TO EACH BOOK, BUT STAYED CONSISTANT WITH THE CENTRAL STORY. I COULD NOT WAIT FOR THE FINALE. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I FOUND THE ENDING ANTI-CLIMACTIC. THE STORY OF STONE AND ANNABELLE JUST DIDN'T MATCH UP TO THE PREVIOUS COUPLES, EVEN THOUGH THE PREMISE WAS COMPELLING. IT SEEMED THAT MS. ROGERS WAS IN A HURRY TO FINISH UP THE SERIES. I HOPE TO SEE MORE SERIES LIKE THIS ONE IN THE FUTURE, THOUGH"
4,"Some truth, some fiction","Ms. Singhi's book really does seem to carry a bit of prophecy, as more than 10 years after she completed it, people are jumping from weather balloons for Red Bull, having babies on YouTube, and didn't some woman auction off the right to name her baby via eBay? It's a look at a dystopian future, and one woman's attempt to escape. Now that was the truth.The fiction? Sarina-dear, Deena didn't finish her Ph.D. after you left, because just as Homer Venters and you did, she figured out she could get out and save the world quicker if she left too. Take care of yourself, hon.Four stars because there should be a Kindle (or even a Smashwords) version."
5,Intelligent - makes painting with a toddler tolerable!,"The paint is in the the handle of the brush. No water needed. You squeeze the handle to get some paint to come out (have you seen the white out pens? same thing). The brush is fairly think and the handle is as well. The best thing is that they are refillable. The paints wash out of clothes really well. The only negative is that my two year old has some difficulty squeezing the paint out. And, she still manages to paint more on herself than the paper. But - no spills at least."
4,External Storage for Your Data,"I've had this eSATA drive for a month, it works well, but only after installing a BIOS upgrade from Seagate. I had to email Seagate support to get access to the upgrade. Prior to installing the upgrade, it would lose DMA and revert to PIO with decrease in transfer rates to 2-3 MB/s. The USB 2.0 port worked well, but with the BIOS upgrade and using the eSATA port, transfer rates are near 60 MB/s. That is about double the transfer rate for the USB 2.0 port, and approximately the same as a Seagate 750 GB internal SATA drive that is used in the same computer this drive is attached to.I didn't like the back up software and removed it from the drive. The ""free"" internet storage is also only a trial offer, and free for a short period of time. I prefer the free backup software available in Karen's Tools."
1,Died - Not recognized in Vista or XP,"For some reason, the Seagate drive is not seen on my computer. The light comes on and stays on regardless if the computer is on or off, but that's about it. When I plug in the power source, I hear it and feel it working, but after that, it just stops."
1,Extreme Heat Issues. Avoid at all costs.,"Didn't get this from amazon, but wanted to add my review of this. This unit has no fan that i can see and after 30 mins or so, the case got blazing hot, almost burnt my hand. Had the drive for about 1 week before it died. I don't know what Seagate what thinking when they designed this, but wow, talk about total failure. I'm taking this back to the big box store for a refund and will never buy another seagate external hard drive.There is also no on/off switch, another major failure. How are you suppose to know it's safe to unplug it? Will pickup the Thermaltake N0012US aluminum external enclosure with a 120mm fan and a separate hard drive. This thing is a absolute joke for $289.99 and a total failure of a product. External hard drives are suppose to backup your data and keep it safe, not overheat, crash and burn."
1,A horrible Failure,"I bought this hard drive and notice that it was very temperamental. If I touched it while it was in use it would freeze the hard drive and my computer. After several weeks the hard drive died, I sent it back to Seagate. I figured it was just a bad drive. Although when I got my replacement it was dead on a arrival, so I had to call up Seagate for yet another replacement. My third hard drive worked, but showed the same problems as the first one. Customer service was extremely helpful and in the end I received a $50 credit towards a new hard drive."
1,Complete garbage,"Bought new from Fry's. Set it up, connected it to 3 different computers and the piece of **** won't even turn on.Stay away from this product."
1,CRASHED,HD crashed after 6 months of use. Same issues as others have reported. I only hope I can get the data back. Wish me luck...but in the mean time don't buy this HD!
1,DO NOT BUY,I bought this Hard Drive to back up a older Hard Drive. All I have to say is that this is the biggest waist of money that I have ever spent money on. Fist off the accrual piece of equipment is not bad. It worked for about 30 days then the USB port broke!! I cant use it I even bought eSATA cords and adapter for my computer! second the customer service at Seagate is by far the worst that I have ever dealt with. they have no way of fixing this it is not covered in the warranty and if they were smart obviously they are not they would sell the little adapter that comes of separately so people can buy them. I have read other reviews about the same problem. it seems that this happens more then just once so be warned. Go with a WD or something else.
1,P.O.S.,"I have to wonder what Seagate is paying Amazon to keep the really bad reviews from making it here (this is my second attempt at a review). And for those who don't know the meaning of my title, the first two words are ""piece of"". This POS failed on me 4 months after I bought it. I thought Seagate was the leader in drive builders...NOT! Never again will I buy a Seagate product. This drive could spell the end for Seagate, because there's too many other good drives out there that WORKand don't cost as much!"
1,Seagate FreeAgent External 750 GB Hard Drive and Vista 64 Bit,"Seagate FreeAgent External 750 GB Hard Drive and Vista 64 BitI like my FreeAgent drive, I just wish the software would work with my 64 bit Vista.The Seagate software will not save selective backup plans that are accessible by the backup software. I talked to the Seagate's help desk and they told me the current backup software does not work on 64 bit Vista and they are not planning on creating a 64 bit version of the program any time in the future.There is nothing on the box to indicate that the Seagate software does not work with 64 bit Vista.So my recommendation is, if you have 64 bit Vista, find a drive where the backup software works, because the Seagate FreeAgent doesn't work as a backup solution on 64 bit Vista.PS: I had to give this one star because Amazon would not let me give a zero star rating."
2,Problems with this item,I had to return this item because it was running hot and seemed to cause my system to have problems.
5,Great HDD for expanding my DirecTV HD DVR,"Combined with a ESATA cable, this 750 GB HDD effectively replaces the DirecTV HD DVR's internal HDD (250 GB) in terms of memory usage. Triples the original recording capacity on my DVR; can't beat that."
1,Drive failure,"Even though Seagate says the drive can be reformatted to Mac OS, it failed no matter what I tried. I talked to Seagate support and they said the drive failed and needs to be replaced. I have had the most success with Maxtor drives and that is what I will be replacing the FreeAgent Pro with!"
3,"Good drive, bad backup software","I bought this USB hard drive in November 2007. The drive is stylish and fast.While the included backup software has a nice front end, once activated it continually runs in the background chewing up CPU resources and causing my machine (relatively new machine 1 year old) to run slowly. I tried numerous settings and had the latest software. I later switched to norton ghost, which does a great job of backing up when and how I want.If the backup software that came with the drive was usable, then this would have been 4 stars. If the internet sharing feature was not limited to 6 months and/or was more accessible then + 1 star."
4,"Great drive, tad slow","Great drive, very reliable. Sleeps well with Mac OS X, USB 2.0 is still a bit slow for me as I am used to Firewire 800. A great drive for the money. I love the orange glow!!"
1,Amnazon Shows In Stock Had on order over a week now say 6 + weeks,"Dont beleive Amazon when they say this is in stock. I ordered 2 of them over a week ago and they said they would send today.Today get an Email that they dont have it and it will be six more weeks do I want to cancel.You Bet!Go Buy your stuff from somewhere other than Amazon. They wasted my time and Im sure they would like to waste yours. I actually needed the drives, not the lie that they had it in stock."
4,In Response to Carol...,"In response to Carol's posting, who wrote:""You get only a short trial period, then the only utility that you can use is the diagnostic utility. ""Actually, the activation code for the software is included with the FreeAgent Pro, so it's the full software. It's in the startup manual that came with the drive."
2,Poor eSATA interfaces on the FreeAgent Pro drives,"The FreeAgent Pro hard drives appear to have poor eSATA interface implementations. Seagate has released a firmware update with fixes some of the problems, but people still seem to have problems even after applying it.There is a link to the firmware update on the page where I blogged about this topic here: http://blog.noegruts.com/2007/12/seagate-freeagent-pro-esata-problems.htmlHope that's of help to some people."
4,"nice drive, trial software","This is a nice drive with plenty of storage and fast data access. I now have 2 of these connected via eSATA and I am very pleased with data access time. The data write speed is good as well. It comes with some backup software that is very nice, but unfortunately it is a 30-day trial. It would have been nice to have a fully functional version after shelling out $240 for the drive.If you have no need for the backup software, don't install the Seagate software package when you hookup the drive. It has a couple apps that, once installed, run as background processes on your PC (of course!). You don't need to install any drivers or software to use the drive. It is ready to go out-of-the-box. Cool orange light too!"
1,Many problems,"I had this for several years. The annoying orange light defaults to being on. I found out how to turn it off, but after a while it just started glowing again on its own. There were delayed write errors every week. Many times, the computer would not recognize the drive. This would happen regularly, and I would have to power down the drive and reconnect it. Since I was using this drive for backups, I did not access it often, and there was no visible indication that it was not connected. I had to start checking in Windows Explorer that it was connected. Finally, one day the orange light started blinking. The flashing light seemed to indicate that it finally died, and there was no way to get the computer to recognize it."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Simply one of the worst piece of electronics that I dealt with, comapring to my WD 500 GB drive. It works on and off, doing better with my Mac than my Windows PC. Take a look at this blog to see a multitude of issues.[...]The write speed is also worse than the WD 500 gb, not sure if it has to do with the extra size. Though it claims 750 gb, there is really 650 gb free space; ditto with WD. These specs games are a sham in this industry. This HDD runs very hot, vis-a-vis the WD.BTW, WD also has its issues with their other stuff, like the Live HD media box, but not their HDD."
1,Large files or folders scare this drive.,"If you like ""Delayed Write Failure"" to crash the drive every time you try to open or use a large file then this outdated drive is for you. In simple words, every time the drive over heats every 15 min it crashes and loses your files."
4,"Two complaints, but otherwise so far so good","First, the CONS: 1) Everyone seems to mention how easy it is to turn the drive off with the touch-sensitive power button. But when I turn the drive off, I can't get the drive to turn back on again unless I unplug (and replug) BOTH the power cord and usb cable. What gives??2) No fan or vent holes that I can see - how heat management works on this system (or doesn't?) is beyond me.Now, the PROS: 1) Five-year warranty always makes a consumer feel warm and fuzzy (but as others have mentioned, there's a catch. They apparently charge a grip to help you recover your data)2) It is very quiet, and looks very cool on your desk.3) It comes with FreeAgent Pro software which helps back up your computer with ease, but is probably superfluous if you use Vista's (or Thinkpad's) backup software."
5,"Huge storage space, tiny freeware","This drive has an insane amount of storage space, however it also has a 2mb freeware program on it too, but that can be zipped to an easy 1.5!!!"
3,Disappointing Purchase,"The previous reviewer effectively and accurately criticized this book but still awarded it four stars. Excuse my impoliteness, but my three stars is probably too generous. A few close-up photos of fabric designs, chair legs, picture fragments, etc. do not justify entitling a book The Paris Interior. Most of these close-ups might have been made right down the street no matter where you live. The furniture fragment photo shown on the cover typifies the approach taken inside the book."
5,HIGH QUALITY APRON at a NICE PRICE!,"My fiance and I just ordered our first BBQ grill and I wanted to surprise him with an apron to celebrate his imminent role as chief GrillMaster. When I found this apron, I knew it was PERFECT for a few reasons ... (1) Black color (to hide a multitude of BBQ related stains as well as being a ""manly"" color), (2) EXCELLENT reviews regarding product quality, (3) a HILARIOUS slogan embroidered on the front, and (4) a VERY reasonable price! I am VERY pleased with the item and I look forward to making future apron purchases from this seller. Thanks!"
5,Wonderful Gift,"I bought this as a Gag Gift, and when it came I was very surprised at the amazing quality of the apron. I thought it would just be one of those things they would open and laugh at and it would never be seen again. NOT SO! The quality of the apron is better than most any apron I own, probably chef quality, and even the lettering is really nice! She wears it all the time, and absolutely loves it - but it did the trick and gets a laugh from everyone. It was a great gift, but better than I had expected!"
3,Where have I seen this video before?,"I ordered this video based on information provided by Amazon and the one previous customer review. While it's a fine program, prospective buyers should note that all this materialhas been taken from the 6-part series, Legendary Lighthouses, available on DVD. If you have that DVD box-set this will beduplicate material and a big disappointment. Buy this video if you are interested only in accomodation at a lighthouse, and not in the whole story."
3,Makes a nice gift but...,This book makes a nice gift for horse lovers but is a bit small for the price. It could be a few more pages for the price or lower the price by a few dollars. My daughter really liked the book so all-in-all it's not a bad deal. I bought the other 2 books in the English Exercises series and my daughter also enjoyed them as well.
3,Okay,"This was basically another biography of Dominique Moceanu, but most of the information was from the other two books about her which are American Champion and Gymnastics Sensation, since the author got most of her sources from those two books. It was pretty good, but not for a die-hard Dominique fan. Something cool about this book was that it told about Dominique's life after the '96 Olympics. The pictures were nice too, but I wish they were in color. I guess anyone who has never read anything about Dominique would find it interesting."
5,A GREAT LOVE ALBUM,"Although I am not a fan, I admit that Patricia Kaas has the best lyrics and slow music to offer on this album - especially considering that they were written by the best French songwriters and musicians : 10 songs written by Pascal Obispo and 2 by Jean-Jacques Goldman. Both being my favorite French singers, I had to get my hands on ""Le Mot de Passe."" Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Only 4 songs have a real beat to them, all others being slow yet beautiful to listen to, lyrically and musically speaking. My own favorite song of this album is ""Mon chercheur d'or."""
4,Excellent,"This new album by Patricia is well balanced between ballads and rhythmed songs which are all meaningful. ""Une fille de l'Est"", ""une femme comme une autre"" are among my favourite. Moneyworth!"
4,Great album,"Should we expect anything less from this top French singer? The new album is a bit more 'down-tempo' then her previous work. More chansons, more 'french'. That's a nice new step in Patricia's work."
3,Likeable but not over the top!,"An Irresistible Bachelor by Jessica Bird is a likeable story but not over the top. I liked Ms. Bird's last few stories a lot better. Even so, this is still a good book and worth reading, it's just not what I call a ""keeper."""
4,Pretty Good,Just finished reading this. I am now looking for the 2 earlier ones. Had stuff to do but put everything on hold until I finished.
4,bjkGA Peach,"Excellent author. Great service from Comapany. I really enjoyed the book. I am use to reading her BDB books, but this was a great storyline."
5,Shabby Chic Decorating Guide,"It is a lovely book, full of ideas and the photos are the best. I loved it!"
2,It's an autobiography of Rachel.,"The book does have some nice pictures, but all in all, it's mainly about Rachel Ashwell's childhood stories and about the few things that she picked up from the flea markets. The things she wrote were repetitive and concentrated only on her narrow range of colors. The book doesn't inspire you for new ideas that you can create when you do go out on your own to flea markets, but only about the selected items that she bought from the markets. The book would probably be better if it's a all-picture book.I don't know how she can live with only used clothes...I guess it's just not my kinda thing. I don't mind a few used items, but ALL? ick!One thing, though, I really liked about the book is the ""how-to"" pages on how to clean various materials, and that comebined is about 4 pages of the entire book. I wish she didn't use the handwritings as some areas are hard to read.I am glad that I got to read it as a library book; that I did not buy it."
1,Boring.,"The text is boring and uninspiring. I don't want everything in my house to look old and beat up and label it as charming. The book does include some helpful tips on how to clean and restore, other than that it's useless. I'm glad I only paid $5 for it."
1,"Egotistical writing, almost no useful information.","Want to read a diary of a self-centered, self-congratulatory snob? Buy this book. Want some real information? Buy a Martha Stewart book. It is rare that I want to return a book immediately, or give it to someone I don't like. This book qualifies."
1,You think the book is bad... you should see her stores!,"She's more full of herself than Martha Stewart! Most of this book is redundant and common sense. You should see her stores! These things she buys for $40 at flea markets, she sells for $700! With that profit margin, she doesn't need to waste her time pushing books."
2,"Nice photos, boring and self-serving text","In a few years or less, people will look back on the Shabby Chic trend and on Rachel and laugh. Flea market decorating has always been fun and it will remain so as long as shoppers relax, buy what THEY love, and be creative in reusing secondhand objects. Ms. Ashwell's narrow definition of what's cool and what isn't puts a damper on that fun. Already, her beloved faded fabrics and sloppy slipcovers are becoming dated."
4,A visually exciting resource!,Rachel Ashwell does an excellent job of communicating her aesthetic and discussing how to achieve it. She captures the excitment and challenge of transforming the less-than-lovely into the truly beautiful. Ms. Ashwell should be congratulated for her zeal of saving pieces of our past and making such a welcome home for them.
3,"Handsome but narrow,style-wise","Gives a good look at one style related to decorative treasure hunting. If you want more options, my favorite new book of the spring season is Flea Market Decorating, which for me captures the fun of finding flea market treasures and then using to create highly personal rooms that range from cottage to contemporary."
5,Breathtaking photography - provacative possibilities!,"I was afraid this might be redundant with the original Shabby Chic but its not. This is a super book. If you like this look, this may be the best book on the market to teach a decorating style. And what style - the book is fun fun fun! It teaches you to appreciate the beauty in old things and helps you enjoy and even celebrate the flaws. It will get you out in the flea markets and junk stores looking for treasure - you'll delight in the process as well as the result. I'm glad I bought it."
5,Fab Fab Fab!!!!,Rachel did a wonderful job with this book. It is right up my alley with intersresting ideas that add charm to everything. It is incredibly inspiring. It is beautiful and totally teaches you how to let your inner light shine thru in all that you do.
5,A State-of-the-Art Design Book,"You start by taking an interest in the subject matter of this brilliantly conceived book--how to pillage any of the thousands of flea markets and swap meets in this country and turn sow's ears into silk purses.But the impeccable execution of the book itself--particularly Wynn Miller and Cathy Mogull's seductive photography, make this a keepsake in itself. Can't wait to see what Shabby Chic comes up with next--first they revolutionized home furnishing and decor, and now they've shown the publishing world a thing or two as well."
4,Sturdy and well made.,Previously i purchased two similar shelves at kmart. One made out of plastic and the other made w/ a vinyl coating. Both sagged in the middle and just did not work for my purposes. This item is strong and sturdy. Just great. But the shipping cost to Hawaii was very high.
4,"Strong rack, price hit or miss","This rack is now in my pantry, so I can see what I have in stock better. It's a good strong rack, and I have put things like bottles of vegetable oil, boxes of cake mix, cans, etc. on it, no problem, no sag. It's also high enough that standard sized cans fit underneat just fine, as well as large Bush beans cans, and standard sized bottles of pasta sauce. It's long enough that it fits almost the entire width of my pantry, so I'd suggest measuring your pantry before you buy.The only downside to this product might be the cost + shipping, especially if you're getting a few of them. I noticed my local walmart carrying racks now. However, if you believe in paying for a good product, this is a good, strong pantry rack. Don't know if I can say that about the cheaper ones in stores."
5,"intelligent,original and soulful",As a musician it is rare that I hear a new artist that makes me fall in love with MUSIC again. Renee Snyder's new CD did just that. Her voice is warm and beautiful and her songs are written and performed with an intelligence and soulfulness that appeals to all my senses.
5,A Soulful Success!,"You can just tell that writing and creating this music was such a personal and emotional journey for Snyder, and it's so perfectly shared and conveyed through the music and lyrics. I love playing this CD during long drives in the car or romantic dinners for two. I'm thrilled when I find great new talent on Amazon and Snyder is definately a Talent!"
5,"This book is also available as an audio book, two cassettes","This contemporary translation of a small inspirational work by Swedenborg is also available as an audiobook on two cassettes. It is copublished by the Swedenborg Foundation, West Chester, PA, and the Swedenborg Enquiry Centre and Lending Library, Sydney, Australia."
4,Great but where's the handle?,Just the tool I wanted but I wanted it with a handle or pole extension. The head diameter did not fit conventional hardware store rod and was not threaded. Don't consider this karping -- Amazon could make it easier to put the two parts together.
2,Bad design.,"I have a very large house with numerous windows - cleaning them has never been easy. A friend mentioned the Ettore Pro Window Cleaner - it's great! I'll never go back to Windex. As for the Ettore Backflip I found it difficult to use as originally designed. The scrubber when wet felt extremely cumbersome although I would try to squeeze out most of the water so it wasn't dripping all over the place when I flipped it to use the squeegee. A friend recommended using a bath Gauze Sponge - it got off bird droppings, dirt, etc. without scratching the windows, perfect and cheap! Cleaning the windows went quickly once I gave up the scrubber. In short the design of this item doesn't work well, I regret purchasing it. I should have just purchased the squeegee and saved some money."
4,Works good,This cleaning tool works well but I wish it were a couple inches smaller as my house has a couple windows that this tool does not fit into well. I was able to rig up a universal extension pole by drilling a hole though this tool and through the pole and then bolting them together. Would have been nice to just buy an extension pole that fit this tool but I don't think one exists.
3,Ok for some windows,I tried to use with a sixteen foot telescopic arm and had so-so results. Seems the blade is to close to the wash pad for my taste.
2,Hard to Believe - STILL DOES NOT FIT ETTORE POLES,"Hard to believe this problem has not been fixed. Now does this head fit easily available extension poles sold locally! Get a grip, literally speaking, folks, and fix this problem!"
1,Extremely dissapointing & ineffective,"The product description reads ""No-sting formula.Waterproof.Ideal for larger scrapes and abrasions.""I disagree with all three of those claims. This spray on bandage stings a fair amount, takes forever to dry (and then washes off in your first shower), thereby making it far from ideal for large scrapes & abrasions. My biggest problem with this product is that it remains sticky even after it has dried. I recommend you skip this spray on shortcut and stick with the brush on NewSkin. It works *so* much better."
5,Book about the Glass Houses of the mid 18th Century,"This is a great book about a boy who goes to work in one of the early glass houses in New England.It is written for a youngster, but the historical references and accuracy are great for a glass lover!"
5,Day by Day,"I read the book out loud to my significant other. We really enjoyed it, and he never reads so he was extremely captivated by the wait. He also guessed the story wrong and was angry when it made him cry."
3,Not Premium Og,"Although I enjoyed this story, It wasn't as powerful as any of the ""Greatest"" series were. I found it to be too predictable. If you aren't familiar with this author and really want to get a taste of his brilliance start with ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" I actually think this book would be great to introduce young readers (13 & up) to the wonderful and profound messages that Og teaches, especialy boys because of the subject matter (a lot of info about boys little league baseball) Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book, just not up to par for Og, in my opinion."
4,"Fun, but follow these steps","1) Don't set it up on carpet.2) Gently tape track supports to table/hard floor.This car gets going fast and the force around the turns can make the track contort which then derails the car. Use on hard floor/table and gently tape down the rail the track snaps into in a couple of places.It's pretty neat if you follow these steps. Was slightly disappointed in the charge the car kept, but I realize it's hard to expect much when it's being charged by AAs.Also hard to tell a 2 1/2 year old that you can't ""do again, do again"" until the battery charges! That said...I put it away for 6 months and plan to get it out when the toddler ""get's it"" a bit more. [...]"
4,Entertaining,My son received this as a christmas gift and loves it. Took a little bit for him to understand how to work it. Only down fall is that it won't run on carpet. Requires hard floor or table to sit on.Goes really fast!
3,Retrospect Journey,"Aside from Wheel in the Sky and a couple other songs, this 1981 live disc doesn't do much for me, though Christian metal music is my favorite kind of music now that I'm born again."
1,Journey?,"Who, in 2006, listens to Journey? These guys are has-beens who record strictly for the money. Anyway, you can do better than this. Get the new Pussycat Dolls instead."
5,"Beautiful Jewelry, Fast Shipping and Great Service",The jewelry was absolutely beautiful. My items arrived in no later than a day or two. Service was prompt and highly recommended.
2,Great bracelet but broke fast,The bracelet arrived in a timely manner and I loved it! But two of the eyes broke off within a week of owning the bracelet. I also bought the turquoise color from the same seller and that one broke as well. I love the bracelets but I'm hoping to find someone to buy from who makes them of better quality.
4,MolyMod is Great.,"I really like the Molymod Molecular Set for Organic Chemistry. I love that the pieces are big enough to easily work with and that the bonds can be bendable or stiff. The only thing I don't really like about it is that there aren't a lot of bendable bonds in the set to make larger molecules other than cyclooctane. The was about the only disappointment, but if you are a visual person, this product will most surely get you through Organic I and possibly Organic II (currently taking that). Good luck with your studies though regardless of what product you decide on. It's all about personal preference in the end."
4,Dear season?,This is a true crime book by Dave and lynn Distel about Bruce Moilanen who killed his 35 year old wife Judy Blake Moilanen. Bruce almost got away with the murder and would have if it hadn't been for Sergeant Ball painstakingly gathering evidence against Bruce. This is an interesting read.
3,Useful information but too detailed,I felt this book was too pedantic and somewhat difficult to read. I believe there are better texts on the market.
5,Excellent!,"This book is an excellent selfhelp book. Was delivered in excellent condition and very fast. Everybody should buy this book. It could help many, many people with there relationships..... and saves lots of money with Therapy :)"
1,this author is off base,I just got out of an abusive relationship and this women treats the subject as some small problem that can be solved with therapy. Lundy Bancroft understands this author does not. Moreover the information in this book could keep women in abusive relationships by hoping the abuser will get better.
5,Wonderful,This is a great book for those who are willing to identify and heal abusive patterns in relationships (which includes yours and theirs) Highly recommend!!!
1,Hated It,Didn't realize when I purchased it what to expect. I hated this book and wasted my money. Would not suggest anyone buy this book
4,"Good book, quick read","This book is a good book to help you gauge how abusive your relationship is. In the first part I thought I was too far gone to salvage my relationship, but after reading some of the case studies, I learned that we were doing alright. It has helped me change the behaviors I knew weren't effective. It has also been a good book to prompt me to delve further into my life. Abusive relationships are most often the symptom of a different more personal problem. In my case that was true and I have begun to address that and now my relationship is doing much better."
1,Save your money for Lundy Bancroft,"This is like a ""dummy's"" or a ""McDonald's"" guide to emotional abuse. Doesn't compare to Lundy Bancroft's work. It provided no clarity at all. Because Engle tries so hard to make it balanced, the book left me more confused about my role in an abusive relationship---that's not a good place to be. Abusers are constantly telling the victim ""you're the problem"" ""if only you could fix yourself."" It preys right into an abuser's tendency to claim that he is himself is the victim. Save your money for Lundy Bancroft."
4,Great,"The product arrived very quickly. The balls were more used than other companies. For the price, the quality was expected, but I would definitely buy again."
2,Disappointed,"I have ordered recycled golf balls from Amazon before and this time I was not happy with the overall condition of these ""NXT"" balls. 30% were ""very good"", 35% were ""good"" and 35% were ""crap"" (faded with nicks).I can buy ""crap"" recycle balls at our local Ace Hardware for .25 cents each. I might have just got a bad lot of balls (36) but I would not use this seller again mainly for the same price that includes (shipping & handling) you can buy NXT ""TOURS"" with a different Amazon dealer and they were 90% ""very good"" and 10% ""good"". I have had great success with Amazon so hopeful this was just a one time dud for me."
3,"Poor packaging, but decent golf balls","Some of the balls were in pristine condition, while a few had more blemishes and scuff marks than I was expecting (I'll hit those when there's a chance I'll just hit them right into the water). The packaging was really terrible, though. Flimsy boxes that don't stay shut. Heck, they weren't even taped down, so when I opened the package, the balls were all over the place. But there was an extra ball in the package, so I actually got 37 balls. For less than $1 a ball, I'm pretty satisfied, although I wouldn't give them all AAAAA grades that they gave them."
5,Great Balls!!,"Some of the balls look new, a few look like they may have been hit once or twice and have minute remnants of golfers sharpie marks, and a few are logo overruns. Just what the doctor ordered for someone looking to play golf with a good ball on a budget."
3,XOUT ball,"Received my order for 36 pack ""Titleist NXT Tour Recycled golf balls"" in two boxes; one was a 12 pack and one was a 24 pack. I used the 12 pack first and for the most part the ball were at a three or four star level. Then I started to play the next two dozen balls. The box contained balls of 2 to 3 star level, four balls that were only ""NXT"" not ""NXT TOUR"", and 1 was a XOUT balls. I will not buy from this seller again."
1,Poor Condition NXT Tour Golf Balls,I received the recycled NXT Tour Golf Balls and they are terrible. More than 1/2 of then are so worn that the numbers on the ball are missing. Your description is not clear enough. I would never have purchased if they were described correctly. These are the kind of balls I throw in the pond for the fishes. I'm ashamed of you for selling them.
2,Class c golf balls. This is not what is being advertised.,"I have been buying ""BRAND NEW"" Nxt logo balls from the PGA Tour Super Store for 14.95 a doz. Then i came across this ad which led me to belive that these were like new balls for less money and free shipping. They are no where close to new, some of them have a yellow/brown cast to them like they have been sitting in water. They have been hit many times and some of them even have ""Practice"" stamped on them, in other words it looks like i have purchased RANGE balls. The ad said they were in stock but when i ordered them on the 5th of march they came up back ordered and i finally recieve them on the 22nd of March. Do yourself a favor and DONT BUY THESE."
1,Bait and switch?,I can't believe this. The description is clear Titleist NXT Tour so tell me why I received TaylorMade golf balls? Nowhere does it say or ask about alternatives so how does this happen?
4,Oops!,"First of all, let me start by saying that nothing/noone is perfect. I am a HUGE Amazon fan but despite my long history of flawless transactions,into each life a little rain must fall. I ordered Titleist NXT Tour recycled balls and received Nike Tour balls. In defense of Amazon's otherwise stellar track record, the barcode sticker used for inventory pulling was incorrect. Sticker said Titleist, contents were Nike. Mix-up resolved IMMEDIATELY upon reporting and Amazon shipped correct product in no time even before I returned the incorrect product. Oh yeah, I use this seller for my refurbed NXT Tour balls all the time and have never been disappointed. Great ball for an even better price. Look forward to using this seller again."
3,Used golf balls are what they are,"You walk into the rough and find a ball....fish one out of the pond...both used....play with them or not?....if that doesn't bother you, then go for these.... they still say Titleist"
4,"Some misses, but overall great value.",I'm about an 18 handicapper so I will lose a ball from time to time. Looking for a more economical way to purchase quality balls I tried these.ConsNot all for the balls were NXT tour 3 of them were regular NXT.2 had scuffs that were noticeable.After those two cons the other balls were great and very playable. All the while paying a fraction of the cost for a ball that there was a strong possibility of losing within two rounds anyway.
4,THIRTY OVER 36,RECEIVED YOUR SHIPMENT TODAY AS PROMISED. I EXAMINED EACH BALL AFTER WHICH I ELIMINATED SIX BALLS EITHER FOR ABRASIONS OR SOME DISCOLORATION FROM WATER.THE SIX I REJECTED IM SURE WILL GIVE MANY ROUNDS OF ENJOYMENT. BOTTOM LINE IS THIRTY BALLS FOR THIRTY DOLLARS IS A GREAT BUY I MIGHT BE JUST A BIT MORE PICKY THAN MOST.
4,Very good value,Received these balls in good time and I'm very pleased. I do notice some slight discoloration on a few of the balls but most appear to me in close to mint condition. Will probably reorder in the future.
5,Relaxing Celtic instrumentals,"I have 2 of Laura's vocal CDs and this is a nice addition to my collection--for times when background music (in-laws over for dinner liked it!) is called for. The music flows together without stopping and these are beautiful Celtic folk/pop instrumentals. As you might expect this is not a one-chord ""zoning"" type of CD, as it is quite melodic and the orchestration is more involved than some massage-type CDs, but his will fit a mood and I find myself reaching for it time and again--great for weekends and unwinding!"
5,A remarkable book if you are an avaition history buff,I also met Walter at a confederate air force showing at Oakland Int. Airport. What an interesting guy. This book is a great read if you want a first hand account of what it was like from the first day of training to coming home from Europe after 35 misswions.Thank God we had this guys when Hitler and Tojo came to power.Larry Williams
2,Better product on the market than this one,"Dot its are ok, but don't raelly direct the light source well, too diffuse. I prefer the Pop Up Microlite, tiny LED that has much more focused beam. IT was designed to illuminate the surface it sticks to. I buy them online at microlitetech.comTry it."
4,Deluxe vesion of LED light,"I can buy cheaper versions that work just as well 3/$5 at a local hardware store, BUT, as I use them for trade shows, these units are more rugged and have a nicer finish."
5,Nice,Holds that Lantern and my extra mantles and mantchs very well. Which makes it nice to keep everything in one place.
5,Navarre Bible for the serious or pleasure student of the God's Word,"Get this Bible--get it quick.This Bible sold by the book or collections of books offers access to early churchdocuments, saints and great Christian leaders, early world history and insight intothe life of the, early Christians as well as RSV Bible and the New Latin Vulgate.The reader has access to resources via citation and commentary that would likelyrequire years and years of formal Bible study.I am thrilled.I really didn't want to buy another Bible. I have many bibles. I kept coming back toNavarre Bible.Finally I couldn't say 'no!' No other Bible gives me the depth of study, the beauty ofearly Christian writings, and insightful organization--all in the same volume.This Bible has invited me to an even deeper faith journey.Do yourself a favor and search 'Navarre Bible'. Buy at least one book and make upyour own mind!May God bless you and inform you as you study his word."
5,Very happy with product!,The quality is excellent and idea that it becomes a table when not being use for a footstool is great! I am definitely considering buying another one.
2,Incomplete sentences,"This book had potential, but frankly, I can't believe it is still for sale. Amazon, or someone, should pull this book! There were major editing problems, such as incomplete sentences ending on one page and a new subject on the following page. Not great for kids learning to read!"
4,Good pictures and information,"An excellent book for a child who is exploring the world of horses. Good pictures, descriptions, Suitable for a precocious child to explore on their own and great for bedtime too."
4,educational,"good book for basic information. It covers a wide range, eevery thing from types of horses to the history of horses."
3,Information book for grandchild,Wasn't quite the quality I was looking for but the information was very good. I ordered it for a young grandson newly interested in horses.
3,Simple yet nice,The earrings are very simple and small but at the same time elegant and nice. The black onyx stone is matte in color but still compliments the silver hook and bottom bead elegantly.
2,LOW BUDGET,"I have to hand it to the people who made this video. They tried, and since I have never made a video myself, I can't be too critical. It goes to show that you can't judge a ""movie"" by it's cover. The house that is pictured on the cover is what attracted me. This is not the house that is in the video. The makers of the video appear to have borrowed a plantation museum to use as the location for most of the video. The dialogue is long and drawn out and there isn't much of a plot. I don't know if it was because I watched it on my laptop or if the video has a glitch, but the audio doesn't line up with the video.Again, it was an attempt, but that's about it."
1,"Dreadful, not even worth the rental price",Simply a dreadful movie in every respect. Sitting through it's entirety was one of the hardest things I have ever done.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I feel ripped off and I just paid chump change for an Amazon rental to view the thing. AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!
3,MIstake,I bought this by mistake so I didn't and won't finish watching it. i don't like this type of movie so I don't have a fair comment for it.
5,Relaxing and enjoyable,This is a New Age CD in which they blend Natures sounds with synthetic keyboards. It is a peaceful and relaxing incorporating the soulful sounds of Pachelbel to the background of oceans peaceful waves. It incorporates moody and joyful soft instrumental music set to the sounds of nature for a very relaxing and enjoyable sound of nature. If you close your eyes you can almost imagine yourself sitting on a beach listening. Very relaxing and enjoyable.
2,iGo Power Xtender,"I must say the seller did everything right with shipping the extender. This review is for the product itself.When I saw the extender I was so excited because I was going to Hawaii and I knew my battery life on my Kindle Fire would not last the 5 plus hours. I ordered the extender but in the description I didn't notice I would have to buy a tip too. So after going to Radio Shack to buy the recharger tip where I found out that the model I bought has been discontinued. Off to Hawaii, what I found it is very hard to keep the tip in the Kindle while still using the device.I think for my next long trip I will be buying another product that hopefully works better."
3,IGO Battery charger,This charger is too heavy the case keep opening and the batteries fall out. I think it could be smaller
2,delicate,product is very delicate. if it does not fit in all the way and you hold the phone right then it will not work. had to set phone down and put it in a certain position for it to charge up
2,"Great idea, but disappointing","I gave this two stars because I am hoping my experience is due to a faulty device that is not representative of all produced.I got it for my Samsung Infuse (don't forget to buy the proper tip separately - it won't work otherwise). It sticks out and is difficult to pocket and awkward to hold while charging; but it does provide some juice to finish a task.Mine keeps shutting off before even partially charging my phone. To get it to come back on, I have to remove the bottom case & batteries & reassemble it. I suspect there is not enough tension on the battery holder to maintain proper electrical contact.I have tried it with 2 different sets of batteries and cleaned the contacts with a pencil eraser with the same unacceptable results.I'll keep it because it is small and portable and may help in a pinch. However, I'll carry my larger iGo Charge Anywhere for a reliable phone back-up battery."
3,"Good Idea, But........","Great idea, and it works, but it's the worst design I've ever seen for such a device. If you don't buy the extender to go with it, you've got this relatively heavy brick hanging directly off your device. Not very slick. And every time I try to use it,I have to hunt down the parts and re-assemble it. It refuses to stay together. But there are very few devices of this type available and none that have the ability to power so many different devices, so it wins the race, if only by default. But I have a similar device made by Palm for the TX and Treo devices. It never comes apart, and it has a long lead on it so it's not hanging directly off the device. Now, if it could only accept the iGo tips. If you need one of these, by all means get one. It will do the job. But consider getting the extender to go with it and find some kind of case to carry it in...so the parts will be easy to find."
3,IGO does emergency power,"This is a good device with several flaws.PROS:First it works with most devices.Second it does charge devices as promised.Third it used convenient AA batteries.Fourth it is light and fairly small.Cons:First Connection to device is a very poor design.Second this device is very inefficient, my phone battery is a 1500 MA battery thus two double AA with 2000 MA each should be able to charge my phone at least twice. My phone only charges about 10% in an hour and the batteries are dead. My solar charger has a 1500 MA battery and it fully charges my phone before it dies.Third the case has a cheap plastic rod to hold it closed, this rod breaks after a period of use.Fourth it is fairly expensive, you have to buy each tip, the extender cables and the case.This charger is good for Emergency use or where you do not have access to a plug but should not be used as a convenient external battery."
3,Good and bad,"It worked as intended until the battery cover suddenly broke prematurely. Although I was able to keep it working by holding it together with 2 rubber bands, it is quite annoying. There aren't many devices like this available on the market and it significantly extended the battery life of my GPS. One star is taken off by the broken battery cover and the other by having to buy the extra mini USB tip (making it more expensive and less convenient)."
1,Not what is pictured,"Be warned the picture looks like it comes with a usb tip and the colors look all nice and clean but the one they will send you in fact looks nothing like the picture. They need to post more up to date photos or more photos, so that you can clearly see the tip. Plus when you go to return it you are out the shipping, cause they won't cover it. Beware, you may think you are getting a good deal but you have to also purchase the tip to whatever device you are hooking this up too."
4,Life Saver,"I've been looking for a product like this for years and have been told it doesn't exist - I guess I was just looking in the wrong place! This little iGo is a life saver for anyone who has to travel with an iPod or other gadget. I will say that the batteries don't last long - I tend to only get a couple or few charges out of one set - but it is worth it. There's nothing worse than being stranded with a dead iPod. Even more, having a dead cell phone can potentially be dangerous, so this little credit card-sized charger is great. Plus, with the interchangeable heads, it works with almost any device. Great Product!"
1,Battery Extender???,"In theory this product is a good idea, but the execution is horrible. I wanted to use it to charge my BlackBerry, but it shuts itself off after 10 minutes and there's no noticeable difference in the battery power on the phone. I would recommend that you stick with wired chargers or use another brand that will work better than this one. I have used other iGo products before and didn't have a problem. Perhaps it's just the design of this product."
2,"Yes, it is a portable recharger, but...","I've used this as backup, because my smart phone can't even last a day. However, I'm not happy with it (actually just threw it out.)Pros: you can purchase an adapter for most electronic devices. I've used the same device for 2 different phones, but had to purchase a different adapter.Cons: Very awkward (difficult) battery accessCan't charge item in purse - awkward, bulky setupMine suddenly died, and it's not the batteries.When it's on, it is draining its own batteries, regardless of the charge status of the item being charged.I'm currently on Amazon to purchase a different backup charger. I won't go back to the iGo after it left me stranded!"
1,Don't waste your money...,"I know it's only $4.50, but this is a piece of garbage that is so outdated (made in 2007) that it should be in a museum. First, it comes with no tips. When I ordered it, I thought it would have something other than the base unit. I haven't used it because I refuse to invest more money in this...it is so old that it probably won't work with my Galaxy S3 and if it does, it would probably not be able to power it much.I bought it out of desperation when Hurricane Sandy hit. I regret buying this and wasting my money..... P U R E -- G A R B A G E!"
2,SUCATASSH,IN A DISPLAY OF EXCEPTIONAL RETARDATION IN THE FIELD OF MUSICAL STREAM COMES A TINY BOAT OF COMIC ERRORS... MUSICNOTMUSIC
3,Does the job... but not perfectly.,"Works perfectly when set at 48V. No discernible background noise or hum. However, at 12V a rather loud hum appears. The mic I'm using it on is rated to accept 11-52V phantom power and no hum appears when I hook it up to a different mixer that has 15V phantom power built-in. Therefore, it's probably a defect in the Behringer unit. Since I can use it just fine at 48V, I probably won't bother returning it, but others might want to steer clear if you can."
3,Didn't come with a powercord,"Now, I get it, it's small but it didn't come with a power cord....disappointed in paying that much for it and no power cord!"
5,Works well,"I'm using this with a Marshall MXL V67 condenser mic, works fine. not much else to say - it provides DC power as it should."
3,i bearly use it.,the mic for some reason is too low. they are both from the same company. i trade it twice and still. i have to be very close to it. a lot of white noise too. i have been using my blue snowflake.
3,quality,one thing about this product that i didnt like was the size since they were talking about large jars....well..when i think large i think 26 oz but it was about half the size i expected
4,nice workbook,These workbooks are great... I started doing one or two pages a day with my daughter at age 3 and we continue to do them frequently. The phonics blends workbook has been helpful in introducing and reinforcing phonics concepts.
3,obselete,"This book has good evaluations of the shows that were on at the time it was published. Unfortunately, none of these shows are on anymore. Bring back Taxi dammit"
3,Not ever close,"This is not a cut on Chaka Khan, who is fantastic. It is just that this album has too many non-hits and not enough of Ms. Khan's chart toppers. I mean how can you have a Chaka Khan greatest hits album and not have ""Sweet Thing"" on it. Come on now!"
5,Awesome!,"My son uses these paint markers at playgroup and they are awesome!! They wipe off VERY easily, MUCH easier then washable markers. They are easy for him to squeeze and he loves playing with them. He is almost 2 and they are a big hit with most of the 1, 2 and 3 year olds at playgroup."
4,"its good,but hard","this games good, i just got it today, and it seems a little teenie bit boring. i would get this game. also the game is hard."
5,Don't be FOOLED....,"by people who say they know techno, then tell you this is not a good CD!!!This is ONE OF THE BEST CDs ever made!!!!! PERIOD!"
1,no quality at all,"ive heard some preety lame jungle djs but this one takes the ""most lame dj"" award... man, this dj has anything BUT style and after reading customer reviews i went ahead and bought this cd, thinking it was worth the $$ but man! THE WORST CD I OWN.. if youre thinking of getting some dark jungle and if u like ur beats fast, dont look here.."
5,In dreamland once more......,"THIS is an incredible return to form for Bob Dylan's favourite singer-songwriter - and made more incredible because of the great man's recent health problems. This album is full of classic Lightfoot - if you love songs like I'm Not Supposed To Care, Dreamland and even the early stuff like Early Morning Rain - then you will be in seventh heaven here. The title track is beautiful but it is the live recording of Shellfish that takes the honours, a masterpeice of crafted beauty that can easily sit alongside classics such as If You Could Read My Mind, Endless Wire and East of Midnight. He may be getting old, he may have sounded frail on previous album A Painter Passing Through.. but here he is back on form in great voice, sounding good and singing the kind of lyrics we all love and cherish... long may he reign..."
2,The Rich Voice is Not There,"I recently purchased about six Gordon Lightfoot CD's. All of them are prior to 1983. It seems about that time frame that his voice started to change. While he is still a fine song writer, his beautiful voice is simply not there anymore. That said, I do like the song ""Inspiration Lady"". Even though it is not the voice of the younger Gordon Lightfoot, it is a beautiful song nonetheless. It certainly expresses a beautiful sentiment, which, is what so many of Gordon Lightfoot's songs do."
5,Gordon At His Best,"This is the long awaited ""Waiting For You"" follow up. Play both CD's in random order, and you've got ""Classic Lightfoot - part 2"". Just buy this CD and enjoy!!"
4,Still amazing after all these years,"I was first introduced to Gordon's work in 1967 by a friend whose family summered not very far from Orillia. I have listened and loved the man and his work all this time. When I first heard Harmony, I thought it was a good album considering how it was put together. The more I have listened, the more I have been amazed. His lyrics still send chills and speak to the heart and mind. The music goes hand in hand with those well-crafted words. In many ways, I think this is one of the best albums he has given us. It truly is a gift. Thank you, Gordon."
4,"Sweet, lovely, poignant","I've been a Lightfoot fan for over 35 years and have seen him perform over a dozen times; in fact, we saw him perform just months before he was striken in 2001.Gordon performed ""Shellfish"" and ""No Hotel"" in his set, along with a great selection of old favorites. The decline in his voice was apparent then...the range and clarity are not what they once were...but the heart and soul of his beautiful songs remain and the evening was magical! I feel the same way about this album. My favorite songs are ""Clouds of Loneliness"" and ""Sometimes I Wish"" (and I think his voice seems stronger for these). The songwriting is Lightfoot at his best. For the longtime fans, it's a wonderful gift to have this gifted performer back!"
5,Well Worth The Waiting For You,Order this CD right now. No question about it Mr. Lightfoot has done it again and come up with a classic. 5 stars mininmum.
3,My favorite singer/songwriter is aging but still going,"Let's be honest, if this was Gordon's first CD no studio would have released this disc. However, since I have lived more years than I have left and am no longer the physical specimen I once was I can related to this CD. His voice is ok at best but the song writing and music are as good as ever. So if you are a fan and are on the plus side of 40 you will get your money's worth. If you are under 40 spend your money on other CDs."
5,"Though old, Lightfoot hasn't lost his touch","While it's apparent he has aged since his golden years, Lightfoot can still put out some notes. His voice is still strong and he hasn't lost his ability to write very meaningful music. I bought this CD out of sheer support for Gordo, but I find myself listening to it and enjoying it more than I expected."
5,Gordon Lightfoot,"Gordon has done it again! His first cd after nearly dying is an amazing look into his life. Once again, he captured my heart with his tender and real life lyrics. His voice is still touching, even without the richness of his younger days...the feeling is there, as always. He is a legend and one of a kind. He has it all...a writer, arranger, singer and musician. Also, his band has been with him for many years. Together, or alone, they continue to bring magic...a one of a kind simple yet intricate blend of lyrics and music that has stood on its own for decades and continues to bring joy to my days! God Bless you, Gordon, and of course, all ""the guys""."
4,Getting better again,"While a vast improvement over ""A Painter Passing Through"", and in the same vein as ""Waiting for You"", this is one of the better albums of late, reminicient in overall quality of ""Cold on the shoulder"" - a few fantastic tracks, several good ones, and a couple of ones that will have to grow on me for a while. While Lightfoot does not match his old standard (think 1970-1990) of mass appeal, the classical overtones in the chord progression feel more contemporary and comfortably dated (in a good way) at the same time. Shellfish is a masterpiece that I will never tire of. This album is well worth the cost and time to listen, and gives me hope after his last release that things are looking up. And to think, this was pieced together out of demos and experimentation! Given the time and motivation to really get intellectually creative with the lyrics, Lightfoot could offer us what we all fell in love with in the first place. ""Harmony"" will more than suffice for the present."
4,"nice collection, but....","First, I have been a GL fan since the early 70's, and in my view he is a musical genius and vastly underappreciated, at least in the U.S. ""Harmony"" is a good CD, and it is a minor miracle it even exists, given his critical health issues. But after several listenings I have concluded it does not rank with his very best. While the recordings are of high quality (especially given the circumstances), there are a few weak links here in the material (Flying Blind and Couchiching come to mind).That said, it's great to still have GL with us, and I hope he recovers to where he can publically sing and tour again. And I'd love for him to release a ""live"" CD of more Massey Hall recordings. The two live tracks on ""Harmony"" are top notch."
2,Skip It,"What a disappointment. A few good songs but the engineering is poor, way too much echo to make it enjoyable. Don't buy this one. Get his older CDs, much better."
2,Ouch.,"Sorry to disagree. I don't find much on this cd to get excited about. The voice is long gone and the band members have lost their edge, maybe because they have been together for so long they've lost the ability to bring fresh ideas to the table. It's no wonder this cd is 66,382 on the amazon music ranking. Don't get me wrong, I've loved this guy for years, but enough is enough. My opinion is that he should concentrate on writing and drop the singing."
2,"Wow, no wonder this is # 108,080 on amazon.com","Sorry, the musical part is tolerable but his voice died years ago. This is not the Gord I have come to love and enjoy. Nothing new in the way of classical Gord songwriting, so I was sorry to add this to my collection. He needs to give it up."
2,"Good Monte, Just Okay Recording","This is a thin sounding recording that does not have the punch and verve to fully showcase Monte. An entertaining performer live, this album does not do the guitar man justice. Too bad because he is a good lyricist and player and that gets lost in the tinny recording.Monte's other CD At WorkPlay is excellent all around and a much better representation of him especially as a live performer."
5,In one word.......Wow,"Had the pleasure of hearing his music for the first time last night at a gig he was playing. This dude is amazing. Immediately bought this live cd at the little table they had set up. He played for almost 3 solid hours,just him and his drummer.For those of us who hadn't yet had the pleasure............ all were absolutely drop-jawed. My only con to this cd is that it doesn't include everything I heard him play last night. Somebody needs to wake up the ""music industry"" and introduce this man to the world.He is a freak of nature,nobody should be this talented!!! It just aint natural............a newfound ""Montiac"" in Texas"
3,Not so great!!,"listen people i appreciate texas country and good guitarists as much as anyone. don't get me wrong, monte has talent with the guitar, but he's not at the point where he can cover stevie ray and make him proud. he should stick to his own stuff. his chords are not perfect, sometimes he seems out of tune, and to be perfectly honest i don't know how anyone can say he has a good voice, good guitar player, good live show, but maybe he should step back and let someone else to the heavy singing, he's just not cut out for it."
4,Works but expensive,"The extension cable does the trick and it securely attaches to both ends. I used it for my security cam, and web cams and was able to receive the same picture up to 70 feet. The only thing is the price. It is over prriced i think. But if it is necessary these extensions are helpful."
3,Does not work with Web Cameras,"This USB extender did not work for us and we ended up returning it for a refund. It's a 1.1 speed, not USB 2.0, and that prevented us from using it connected to a web camera. The speed was simply not enough. I recommend not using this because most of the world is now at least USB 2.0 speed. But, iot was very inexpensive and was a quality-made product."
1,AWFUL!,"I bought this hose ""used"". I have bought many things ""used"" and they have all been just fine...until THIS CAME!I was simply mortified.1) Box was poorly secured with scotch-type tape and VERY badly executed.2) When I opened the box and pulled the hose out WATER ACTUALLY POURED OUT from the hose.3) There was a quarter-size HOLE in the hose!Unbelievable in just about every way.Amazon returned and refunded quickly - but that doesn't excuse sending this piece of junk out in the first place.The one start is there - but I would have LOVE to be able to give a NEGATIVE 5 STARS!I am going to hope that this was a very big mistake and not one to be repeated.A BIG waste of everyone's time.I don't see the point of conducting business like this unless they thought that if they just keep sending it - someone will pay for it and take it.Not me!"
5,Snazzy Ho'se,"Tis a hose. I'm happy with it. Had it for about a month. I've been using it for my balcony garden and no problems. I would be weary of heavy duty backyard use, but for a balcony garden and watering plants it works fine."
3,warning on label of this hose,"Did anyone read the warning on the label of this item?? It states that the state of California has declared this item harmful, may cause cancer, etc.???"
2,"Ok, but sprung a leak after a short time","I live in the city where a trip to the car wash is about $14 ... plus I drive a vintage BMW convertible. Since there's a hose attachment in front of my apartment building, this seemed like the perfect solution. The hose worked great for the first two times I used it. But somehow it sprung a leak at the nozzle connection. On a warm day, when I don't mind getting sprayed, while cleaning my car, the hose is fine. In reality, this should not have happened, so I'll have to advise others against this product."
1,Hose Diameter Too Small,"The first thing to be aware of is that the diameter of this hose is extremely small. This makes it impossible to use with most sprinklers or watering systems. I'm guessing it's 1/4 to 3/8 inch in diameter. Note it doesn't list the diameter size here which is the most important thing to consider when buying a watering hose. Other retailers list the diameter as 3/8 inch which is to small for most watering sprinklers to work properly, which I discovered by trial. Average size hoses run from 5/8, 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter. The second thing is that the coiling wears out very quickly."
2,All hoses are not alike - quality not great here,"The gasket leaked from the moment I bought it, and the cheap reeding on the outside of the attachment makes it very hard to tighten and loosen. I have other curvy hoses and they have big facets to them that make it easy to tighten and loosen; not so here. Also, the pressure seemed lower with this hose, I'm not sure why (maybe gasket leaked so much, or the diameter of the hose is larger than other coiled hoses)? Blue color is an oddity, sort of draws attention to itself in the yard/garden when you'd rather have it blend in."
1,"Said shipping, then received refund","I received an email saying this product was being shipped, then a while after received another saying they went to ship and realized they were out of the product and that I've been refunded. It was nice that they contacted me but I really need those bearings for my stepson. I emailed them asking if they would be back in stock soon and received no reply. Maybe Amazon didn't deliver the mail but I received no reply. Now I'm still stuck without bearings and my stepson uses his bike to get to work. For that reason, I give this 1 star."
5,Oi! all the way!,Punk rock the way it should be done. I recommend listening to this album before going to a show. You will be very riled up.
1,Keyspan USB Twin Serial Adapter,Didn't work with MTP AV and Mac OSX.6. Motu said it wouldn't either. I wasted my time and money. Might be a great buy for someone who has an older operating system. bah!
5,Redskin Mug,"Item was recieved in a timely manner, and the seller expedited for me when asked. I needed it before we left out of town, and the seller made it happen. This was an awesome online purchase. I highly recommend dealing with this seller."
1,Damaged without replacement,The shoes are extremely cute but they came missing gems. I asked for a replacement but only was offered my money back. I kept the shoes and am currently seeking on how to fix them. For $50. I would have expected better quality. I really wanted the shoes. If I wanted the money I never would have ordered the shoes in the first place. I will not be shopping here again.
5,Know the power of The Living God through prayer,I chose this rating because it reflects the power of God's character.There is nothing outside of his boundaries; nothing too small; nothing too great.He is because he was and always will be.We see this in the power of Jesus Christ; he who is my LORD and Savior.Peace to all who come to know the Savior of the World.
2,It focuses primarily on the personal life of the designer.,This book was a disappointment. It is more an autobiography of the designer than a detailed account of Diana's designs.
5,"John Broaddus' Laocoon ""Immersion""","He also put out a CD called ""Immersion"" under the moniker Laocoon. It gives the feeling of being underwater. Look for it on amazon.com~!"
5,Hot Wheels Skateboard,"I purchased this for my 7 year old son. He LOVES Hot Wheels and is just now getting the ""itch"" to try his hand at skateboarding. I looked at skateboards everywhere but some were just trashy with skulls and stuff and others too expensive. This was a great price. The board is a little shorter than the ones I had seen in the stores, which I liked, given his age. But it is a ""big"" boy board so he doesn't look out of place when we take it out to the park. For the price, you can't beat it and he really does love it. Would certainly recommend to anyone with a younger child just starting to skateboard."
4,Reminds me a great deal of Television,"It's not easy to categorize what I think are the influences on ""Destination 2000,"" but on the best tracks here the band reminds me a great deal of Television (and that is a good thing) with some touches of Ten Years After and lots of indie bands thrown in.Sometimes Love as Laughter seems to be playing against convention just for the sake of seeing what sort of sounds it can crank out, but mostly the band delivers through sheer energy and innovation.I hope to hear more from this outfit."
1,worst sci-fi flick ever!,"i've seen scarecrow gone wild,I had no problem wid it.but this is the fakest most stupidest,dummest,clummsiest piece of filth eva!its about an alien parasite/specimen it brakes loose kills its captors and goes out on a killing spree...on teens?! you have gots to be kiddin me!it dices and slices the director must have been an alien/teen movie slpiced together kinda wannabe.get it its half teen/slasher half alien flick,stupid!its more of a slasher flick than a sci-fi flick!plus the actress is ugly,ugliest i've eva seen bro!"

5,who is that cleo creature.. phoebe falconer.. where is she?,I'm all about 'cleo'. This movie looks great with epic scenic color washes in great locations that more than make up for the obvious lack of budget.. the only faltering point is the alien looks a little like a paper mache puppet by numbers... However; 'cleo' - the leading lady scientist makes lara croft look 'all about eve'... cleo is played by beautiful new bad girl in hollywood 'phobe falconer' who in this reviewers humble opinion is the future saving grace of action eye candy & definitely the only reason i give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.. I am enamoured.. What else is she in; what other cult 'B' movies can she save & where can i buy the figurine...?
3,not bad but not great either,"How do you combine science fiction with erotica? Ok, now how do you do it well? Erickson's ""Slave Academy"" does better than most but not as well as he could have. The introductory first chapter was a bit too short to give us a full feel for the society in which his story happens. And why do many of these sci fi erotica stories end up reversing the society? Can't there be a story where it may not be great but it can be fixed? And why is being submissive or a bottom often negative? What is good about the book is the character of Den; whose fall from grace is felt via rapid pacing and first-person accounts -- if it had stayed this way the story would have been much better. If you like rough gay sex and can tolerate a negative view of power relationships at times, you might like this book."
4,Better than stupid ol' No scrubs,"this song is reminicent of ""Waterfalls"" and smacks of a maturity than No Scrubs. I Still think TLC need to mature more as the are now three albums into they're career."
5,TLC,TLC IS TIGHT .PLEASE BUY ANY AND EVERYTHING MADE BY TLC. REST IN PEACE LEFT EYE. CHILLI AND T-BOZ KEEP YPUR HEAD UP WHICH I AM SURE YOU ARE BECAUSE ITS TLC FOREVER.
4,An excellent intro,"I find that Introduction to Christian Theology is particularly helpul and thorough for an intro into the subject matter. The beginning of each chapter has an outline of objectives discussed, summary, study questions and chapter outline. I like the fact that Erickson includes various world views, theories and philosophies, then compares and contrasts to the Christian/Biblical view and presents a cohesive conclusion. A must for any student, lay person, and/or pastor."
3,"Sound, stolid, sometimes simplistic","This is a highly regarded summary of Christian Doctrine, and I am using it in this year's introductory theology course. It's fair enough, but some of the implications of doctrine don't seem to have been thought through. In subsequent years, I'll be searching for a better replacement.I'm using the Kindle edition through the Cloud reader. This is dismal for my teaching, since the Cloud doesn't show page numbers. My students use the print edition, and I can't give them useful references."
4,Textbook,This a standard textbook on the topic covering all of the basics. It presents the most common theological views even if they conflict. I found it fairly easy to understand. This is a good beginning textbook.
3,NOT THE BEST QUALITY,"One of the pockets was ripped inside. It runs big, by one size. This is definitely a European size and for very tall people. I am 5'5"" and still the fitting doesn't look right. I returned this item."
3,"John doing covers, I'm waiting for the Real Thing","I have every John Prine album from Diamonds in the Rough to this one (and even the Falling From Grace soundtrack). I discovered him 25 or 30 years ago on some local low budget TV music show singing ""Paradise"" and something else I can't remember now, maybe ""Sam Stone"" or ""Hello in There."" Not sure. But I was hooked then and there. The charm of John is only partly in his delivery; it's mostly in his songwriting. Who can forget the really incredible songs he has crafted (the list is extensive), and his two previous album efforts are truly outstanding - better production, great songs, great John Prine. This album is okay, but it's just covers. Yes, there are some good songs here, and some of the duets are interesting (others annoying) but I can't wait for the next real JP. Just like Lyle Lovett's last album of covers, it doesn't really satisfy like the real thing. John and Lyle: WRITE SOME NEW SONGS!"
2,"Disappointing, Only one new Prine Song","I'm a huge John Prine fan. I buy anything he puts out without so much as glancing at the price (because who cares how much it costs, its new John Prine). I guess it is that sort of hero worship that lead to one of my most disappointing CD purchases in years. This CD really shows you how much influence producer Howie Epstein has had on John Prine's recent success (because Epstein isn't involved with this project). Things look bleak the minute you discover that John Prine only wrote one song (the title track) on the entire CD. To his credit, that one song shines light years above the rest of the tired, mediocre, bare-footed yahoo country songs that fill out the rest of this CD. If you rediscovered Prine with `The Missing Years' and `Lost Dogs & Mixed Blessings', do yourself a favor and check this CD out on a listening station before you buy it (I sure wish I had). This is a very different John Prine CD."
4,Crosses generations,"Fantastic collection of old songs performed with music legends. My mother enjoyed listening to this CD with me. She was delighted to hear some of the old songs she grew up with, performed by many of the singers she use to listen to on the radio. That young John fellow sang pretty good too."
2,How about a song called Disappointment?,"I love music and I have ever since I received my first 45 record, Long Tall Sally(despite my mother's strident objection). Over the years my musical collection has expanded in proportion to my musical tastes and in inverse proportion to the size of my wallet. I want my children to appreciate all types of music and as a result I provide Sunday dinner music selections. All of this brings me to John Prine. He has been played at Sunday dinners often enough that he is nearly a member of the family. Unfortunately, his latest effort will be in the light rotation mode. The guest artists appear to be pasted into the arrangements and none of the Prine wry humor comes through. If you are a loyal fan then you should spring for the disc but if you are new to John then stick with ""Sweet Revenge"" or the terrific ""Missing Years"""
1,In Spite of Ourselves,"Great musicians. Disgusting, unintended, parody of all that is stupid in country western themes. Not a redeemable song on the disc. Does not even deserve one star."
1,HORRENDOUS,"I've been playing and listening to country for more than twenty years and this collection of outtakes is/was the worst ever. I say was, because I threw the CD in the garbage. The list of duets on this recording looked great but in no way lived up to my expectations!"
4,Worth Buying for the title track alone,"The title track, which is the only new song by Prine on this CD, is the most hilarious duet by a male/female duo that's come out of Nashville since Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn's ""You're The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly"". The duets with Iris Dement work best, the song choices are good, and Prine seems to be enjoying the company."
3,Interesting....,This book is wonderful. It gives a reader a look into Japanese culture in all its splendor. All in all a lovely book.
5,My dogs love this product!,"I have three dogs and have used Missing Link for over 10 years. I could tell a difference in my animals within two weeks - brighter eyes, nices coates, more energetic and happier tails. I highly recommend this product... you're dogs will love it."
4,Very Fun,A friend of mine received one of these for christmas last year from his Mom. Just seeing the box is funny but be prepared to laugh when you read the instructions. Before we ever got through even 1/4 of the instructions we were laughing so hard we were crying. This product is very inventive and fun not to mention it tastes good too! I have just placed an order for several to give out to some of my friends a family as gifts to make them smile. Take my advice get a few for yourself and others they're a great pick me up when you need a little sillyness in your life.Sharon
1,request to cancel item IGNORED,I CANCELLED THIS ITEM WITHIN A DAY OF PLACING THE ORDER. I RECEIVED A CONFIRMATION OF THE CANCELLATION BUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER MY ACCOUNT WAS CHARGED AND THE ITEM WAS DELIVERED TO MY HOME. I'M LESS THAN PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE ESPECIALLY AFTER I WAS NOTIFIED THAT MY ORDER WAS CANCELLED.
3,$23 Shipping?,"Well, it looks like a great product... but I'm not going to pay $23 for shipping. Sorry."
4,Their last resort !,Very well put together with an exceptional reference section.Easy to read and follow.Worth the price and I reccomend it.
1,Bad customer service and product,The description of the item was false and it was a hassel to get part of my refund back.
1,The worst kind of melodrama.,"I started reading this book confidently expecting a well crafted book in the mould of Gallico's other works and at the end of it I was shocked.Not only was the story melodramatic and apparently not reaaly going anywhere but it seemed only an excuse to insert something of the seamy side of life .There seemed to be no point to this story and when I discovered a particularly distasteful sexual situation implied at the end I threw this book out .One of the finest pieces of real trash that I have ever read ,this only served to disgust me.Gallico's unfailingly beautiful language is the saving grace but its only a wrapping for a sordid tale that never rises to the emotional heights he achieved in earlier books.I am surprised that anyone would even publish it."
4,Informative Soap Opera!,"This wonderful old read reminded me of the religious twin of Maugham's OF HUMAN BONDAGE: a historical soap opera which keeps you hooked chapter after chapter. Not only does the reader stay engaged by the Peyton Place roster of characters and situations, one also gets an insight into world Catholicism in the first half of the 20th Century. As interesting as it is entertaining! Makes me want to go back and take a look at the campy Otto Preminger movie version starring Tom Tryon and Carol Lynley!"
4,SOLOSMITH,"Joe Perry Project was good for the music, if nothing else. Collecting songs from his 3 albums its a decent way to get all the Joe Perry you'll ever need without collecting all 3 albums. 1 of which is out-of-print."
3,VERY Disappointing,"It may be Perry's Best Of, but that's not the point. The album is disappointing and proves conclusively that Perry without Aerosmith is just another Rock and Roll band. (I guess history showed us that Aerosmith without Perry was just another Rock and Roll band too).This is listenable, it's OK, but it doesn't stand out from the pack - there's nothing that is any different from thousands of other bands. Thank goodness Perry made up with Tyler and went back to Aerosmith ... at least with the Perry/Tyler Aerosmith we have a band that does stand out from the rest."
2,What happened?,"Whoever put this together needs to find a new job........ Never have I ever been so annoyed in watching a DVD where you are sent back to the main menu after every song... very frustrating and takes away from the performance.Since I wanted to add the Commadores to my DVD music collection, this was the only one I could find. I will say the music was fun to listen to and they did put on a good concert, but what a pain to stop after every song.This must be the only Commadores concert out there?"
4,Anothe Commodores title found.,Trying to rebuild my LP collection has been difficult - but with the purchase of this CD I'm getting there. I love the CD and the Commodores.
4,muy bueno,"LA MUSICA DE COMMODORES, SIEMPRE HAN SIDO UNA DE MIS FAVORITAS, EL DVD ESTA BUENO, PERO HACE FALTA LA PRESENCIA DE LIONEL RICHIE"
4,Works Great,This product works great but I would suggest you know what you want to use it for. Watch out what you suck up to because if you suck up food or bugs they might get stuck at the tip of the device since you have to turn it upside down to charge. So I would suggest to empty it after every use.
4,vacuum,"I love this vacuum , my boyfriend loves it too. If you were looking for a quiet small vacuum this is not the little friend for you, this vacuum is actually quite loud. I do love the design and its functionality so it makes up for the loudness. I would definitely reccommend this to people, it lives up to its Dirt Devil name."
3,stylish disapointment,I bought to have in my dorm at college. This works really well on the tiled floor but it really struggles with the (small area) carpet. Over time it (4 months) it has decreased in strength (even with new filters!). I got it for the style (silly but really it is cute compared to the other vacuums). But this is one of its faults. The end is very tiny a bit bigger than a quarter and cant pick up anything bigger.So if you want a nice looking hand vacuum that will die in four months go for it!
2,basically useless,"This product lacks any sort of power and is cheap feeling. It is sometimes difficult to get the vacuum seated in the charging base correctly because it has a weird fit to it. The charging base is extremly light weight so sometimes when you're trying to remove the vacuum from it, the base comes with, due to the weird fit. This vacuum might be okay for picking up minor debris on a hard surface but in no way would I recommend it for carpet, its just not going to get the job done. The nozzle is pretty small as well."
2,homeschoolsusan,"Stylish - Yes! Powerfull yes, but exhaust is positioned in such a way that it interferes with effectiveness - dust and crumbs may be blown by the exhaust before they can be vacuumed by the vac. Since it doesn't have a handle (which helps it look stylish and not like a vacuum) your hand must hold onto the base of the vacuum which when operating vibrates - not an issue for very small clean-ups but may be an annoyance and even feel like your hand is going numb if used for more than a few minutes."
2,Nice looking Vac -,Pros:Great looking vacuumNice Design and nice designPowerful little motorCons:The vacuum end orifice is too small so just ash and bread crumbs can fit through there. Forget about vacuuming even a small rag or carpet.
4,Great dinner music for fuddy duddy's :),"Actually this is a very nice total collection. With mostly piano interpretations of one CD of the following titles:Music of Frank SinatraQuiet NightsMusic of Nat King ColeMusic of Barbar StreisandMusic of the BeatlesThe ClassicsMusic of Burt BacharachTogetherMusic of ChristmasEspresso GuitarPersonally, I like the last disc the best. After so many Piano CD's, it was nice to have a little guitar music.As most of the other reviews stated, this is nice for some stress relief or dinner music.The book portion has some brief content and nice b/w photos.This would make a very nice gift."
2,Not worth the money; ($20 + shipping). Only 30 minutes long. I thought it was boring.,Not worth the money; ($20 + shipping). Only 30 minutes long. I thought it was boring.
2,Easily my least favorite of the series,"Instead of using sound science, explaining it, and sometimes extending it like in the other fourteen books, this one stoops to one of the oldest premises of B-movie sci-fi - and it isn't even scientifically sound.Just because it's easy to shrink people on screen doesn't make it possible. Particularly the way it happens here - accidentally falling in the machine, getting dismantled, and waking up in a compressed duplicate (with the originals still in the machine) and then being able to reverse the process and coming out exactly the same size they were before! How did they even survive dismantling? Even if the process worked how were they able to walk?The whole premise just shakes me up, even twenty years after first reading it. (Might be all those movies and Hanna-Barbera cartoons.) The only reason why I give this two stars is the familiar, endearing characters."
4,Great for Titleist Golfers,"This was a gift to my golfing grandson who is beginning to appreciate having a great golf ball, but can't afford new ones. The balls were in good shape and when lost in the woods or creek, didn't make him feel nearly as bad as having paid full price for new ones."
5,one of the best games ive played ever,very fun game. i almost never play thru a game twice but this one 3x. i would have given 4.5 for fun but i didnt like some of the mini puzzles. i dont really care to think too hard with the right side of the brain when im gaming.
4,Not to bad . . . .,"Every now and then I like to pick up a fantasy book and this time around I read this one. It wasn't horrible by any means but it wasn't the greatest either. It kept me entertained for the most part and that's what counts. As with other books with short stories written by different authors some of the stories are better than others, but all in all it wasn't to bad."
1,better than a soporific....,"After trying two stories in this book (Nora Roberts and Jill Gregory's) and falling asleep through both several times every time I tried to read this I just gave up. The writing wasn't bad per se, just SO boring as to be pointless. Nothing new, exciting or original in any way. Hackneyed and formulaic. I disagree with the other reviewers-I HAVE seen Nora Roberts write better than this. Unless you are having trouble sleeping -then I'd suggest skipping this mundane book.1 star."
2,Struggle to finish....,"I have read almost everything Nora Roberts has read, and am a big fan. I have read and enjoyed all of her other anthologies in this series. This one, though, was a struggle to finish. The Nora Roberts story was good, because as someone wrote, I don't think she can write anything bad. The other stories were awful. The characters, the storylines, the dialogue--boring, unrealistic--ugh! I can usually read a good romance in a day or two at most--this one took me about two weeks to finish because I was so disinterested in the stories, I would put it down (in the middle of a story!) to read something else. I finished each one hoping the next would be better, but no such luck. If you are a Nora Roberts fan (and like me have to read everything she publishes), maybe you can get this book at the library, but otherwise, don't bother!"
5,very valuable for children of survivors,"How can you say this is ""nothing new""? I think the amazing contribution of this book is how it deals with the holocaust across generations. Most books I have seen dealing with survivors only talk about their time in the camps and not how it affected them when they were freed. This book tells the story of Helen's mother, but it also talks a lot about how children respond to their parents' experiences. I think this book is extremely valuable to understanding transgenerational effects of the Holocaust. I highly recommend this book to children of Holocaust survivors, or people who know children of survivors."
4,Haunting and unique,"Helen Epstein offers a unique perspective on this nightmarish aspect of our world history by weaving the stories of children of holocaust survivors into a tapestry you won't soon forget. In turns horrific and haunting, she introduces us to real people with all too real pasts, wrenching us with their tales or amazing us with their fortitude, but always doing so with simplicity and ease. Her prose reads almost like someone's diary that you stumbled onto in an old chest in the attic, and you find yourself unable to put it down as you wrap yourself up in all these lives. I promise you'll never look at the Holocaust the same way again"
5,The second generation ogf surviv,"I read this book many years ago. I was greatly moved by it, and through it understood the special burden children of survivors have to live with. Helen Epstein was the first to really explore the feelings and situation of the children of survivors. The secretness she writes about it, the things which were in the air but never spoken about play a large part in this.I do remember having one point in which I felt the author did not do enough. While she deals with the individual psychological of problems effectively she does not really consider the ' collective side' of the disaster.The imperative to keep the Jewish people alive after such a great disaster is not a subject she dwells on intensely."
4,A Pivotal Work,"As one of the first books which talked about what it was like being the child of Holocaust Survivors, Helen Epstein's book is truly pivotal but, as the child of survivors myself, I didn't find myself in this book. What I've found is that there were many kinds of Holocaust Survivor families - the types in which the parents didn't speak of their horrors and the types in which they spoke too much. In some families the children identified greatly with their parents' tragic pasts and in others, like my own, we ran from their stories.I think this is an important book, but not the final word on the subject. The experience of the Holocaust on a family might have been as individual as the Survivor and their children; to get an idea of what it was like to grow up with Survivor parents it's important to read many of these books.Looking Up: A Memoir of Sisters, Survivors and Skokie"
3,Children of the Holocaust - good but not great,"As a child of Holocaust survivors myself, I was very interested in comparing my experiences with those of the author and her interview subjects. While some parts are really very pertinent and of great interest to me, I found much of it boring and rather tedious."
3,i dont now,i havent read the ook yet but it looks like it is going to be a good book so go ahead an buy it
2,Puh-leeze!,"First of all, this run of the mill attempt on cashing in on the most marketable band in history doesn't even bother to get it's facts straight. For example, it says that Emma was born in 1978, which would mean she joined the band at age 17! Add that to the fact that it was written purely for brittans, and how it ended up in the states is a mystery. To add incompletion to the list of complaints, this book was published way back in 1996, before they even were released in the us! The only saving grace is that this magazine sized book has a lot of good full color photos, but once again, they're so old that any spiceaholic like me has seen them over and over."
4,It's OK,"This was an OK book. It had a ton of super pictures, and a shortened version of the Spice story."
4,YEA BABY!,"I HAVE/HAD THIS BOOK,AND IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.BUT,I DONT THINK THAT IT HAD ENOUGH STUFF ON EMMA,GERI, OR VICTORIA.(A.K.A. BABY,GINGER,POSH)I DONT KNOW WHY.LIKE IT DIDNT SAY THAT GERI WAS THE YOUNGEST.."
2,yawn,"It seems as if the whole book was just printed fromone or two spreadsheets, just generating randomsimple arithmetic questions. Save your money andfind something online."
2,I'll save you money...,"Do two pages of simple fourth grade mathematical equations once a day as fast as you can. That is the book. I thought there was going to be more theory invovled. I can not write of the benefits claimed, for I have not had the book for long enough."
2,much ado about nothing,This was a very disappointing book. It could have been condensed into a 2 page article.
1,Not recomend,"This is one of typical books published by Kumon. Kumon has many learning centers for kids in USA, and my son attended one of them. But I canot recomend the present method since they just rip off money from parents.Many assitants at such centers are not qualified for teaching at all. Students cannot ask any complicated questions for most of cases.I can find the similar pattern of the way of making money in this book.I know, this book might help some of people who have a really decaying brain. I think this is a book for at least 70 or 80 years old who start to show a sign of decrepit behaviors. Many people can make such contents by using PC by themselves."
5,WeatherTech 80367 Dark Smoke Front Side Window Deflector,Deflectors arrived on schedule and were as specified. Installation was easy and the low profile looks well on my truck. They fit right in the window channel so no tape is needed. They are a bit pricey but I think they are better than the stick on type. I plan to get another set for my next truck.
4,"Simple, fun, and gorgeously illustrated.","A very simple story of a bear who gives up his winter hibernation to make Christmas special for his friends. The rhymes are simple, if not especially memorable. The artwork is beautiful, though.""Bear Stays Up"" will remain in the bedtime reading rotation for the holiday season.My four-year-old tuned out after a while, but my two-year-old enjoyed this."
5,My daughter just loves these Bear books!,I highly recommend ALL the Bear books by Karma Wilson and Jane Chapman. All the books are SO CUTE and my 2.5 year old daughter just adores them! The Christmas one makes everyone in the house warm n fuzzy when reading it before bedtime!
5,Bear Stays Up For Christmas,"I purchased this book for my son after receiving the Bear Snores On as a gift. They are his absolute favorites. The pictures are beautiful and the words are lyrical and rhyming. I also like the way it subtly includes both the religious and secular sides of Christmas beneath the overall message of friendship and giving. He has MANY books, but wants me to read this one every night. It's so nice I din't mind."
3,Cute story but small sized book.,This is a cute story as all the 'bear' series books are. I was surprised by the smaller-than usual size of this book. It was up to me to read the size listed but I assumed that it was going to be the same size as the other books in the series. Still like the book but probably wouldn't have paid the price I paid for this smaller-size.
4,Good series,"This series is a fun read for both the reader and the little listener. Bright pictures and a good story. Nice to have a board book version a little one can play with. Two pages were stuck together at the corner so tore slightly when separating, Didn't have time to send back before Christmas."
5,Wonderful Book,"This book is just so sweet, and the illustrations are wonderful. My 2 1/2-yr-old daughter loves it, and so do I--it's my personal favorite--it's just a sweet and quiet Christmas story, nice before bedtime."
5,Great book! Great price! Great delivery!,"All good here, everything was as promised, and arrived within just a few days. Thanks! Will look for this seller again."
4,Grows on you,"I did not like this book the first time I read through it. But the first time I read it to my son, he liked it and I liked it better than I had the first time through. He's had me read it to him several times now, and the book has really grown on me.It's a quiet little holiday tale with some very good illustrations (of the animals--Santa Claus looks a little odd) and it evokes a warm Christmas spirit. There's nothing groundbreaking or new here, but that's okay--for Christmas, a traditional little tale works best.I may look up more of Karma Wilson's ""Bear"" books, if my son keeps asking me to read this one!"
5,One of the best books,I just love this author and artist. We read this book and the others in the series all the time. The pictures are phenomenal and the words just flow so well. My kids love this book but I do also. One of the few that I myself enjoy reading. I would highly recommend all the books by this author.
5,At my house we love Bear,"If your child loves Bear Snores On, you have to get this book. It follows along the same line as Bear Snores On, except this time Bear wants to stay awake and celebrate Christmas with his friends.On the day before Christmas all of his friends( mouse, badger, mole, raven and wren) come to his lair to wake him up.They all pitch in keeping bear awake and preparing for the holiday.Another wonderful Bear story. The text flows just as smoothly as Bear Snores On, and it has the same style of beautiful illustrations. This is sure to be a favorite of any fan of Bear."
4,"Cute, one could-be-religious mention","Our family is not Christian, but we do celebrate Christmas as a family holiday about togetherness, generosity, and giving back to your community. This year I wanted to start a countdown-to-Xmas book per day tradition. But as we don't teach about the Christian religion, I was looking for holiday-related books that weren't focused on the religious meaning behind Christmas. This book fits the bill. It's a cute continuation of the Bear Snores On characters, except the friends try to keep Bear up so he can celebrate with them. There is one mention of something of Christian origin - the line 'The hang up their stockings / by warm firelight / and hum Christmas songs / like ""O Holy Night"".4 stars because while it's cute I don't really think it'll become a holiday classic in our house, and its certainly not as good as the original. But for a cute holiday book, it fits the bill!"
4,Love Karma Wilson,Bear Snores On was the first Karma Wilson book I found and all the young ones I have gifted the book to loved it. I think this one will become a Christmas time favorite
4,"Great Art, Cute Story","Bear Stays Up For Christmas is a cute little book. the artwork is amazing, and my children agree. it was the best part of the book. It is worth purchasing The Bear Stays Up For Christmas for the art alone.The story is about a bear, and his friends, and their adventure one Christmas eve night. The rhyming is so-so, and at times doesn't flow as well as other kid's books, but that doesn't take away from the book's cuteness factor.This would make a perfect gift for younger children. I know we'll be reading it over and over again."
4,Hits the Spot,"Cute and touching Christmas story about a bear who forces himself to stay awake so he can participate in holiday festivities with his friends, even when his body is telling him it's time to hibernate. This is the second book featuring these characters that we've gotten, and my 4-year old daughter likes them."
4,Awwwww,"Colorful, comic illustrations are not the only thing this holiday story for kids ages 2-6 has going for it. An engaging cast of animal characters and a well-told story with a bit of a fun twist will catch their attention and captivate toddlers, beginning readers, maybe even a few older siblings. Little ones will be shouting along by the end of the story, and I bet they'll march around chanting the catchy lines of the rhyme. A comfy, cozy size for cuddling up and a relatively low price for the library bound Bear Stays Up should make it a popular gift this season."
3,An Ideal Very Short Bedtime Story:3.5 stars,"""Bear Stays Up For Christmas"" is designed for very young readers (the publisher recommends up to second grade). A child who has just learned to read would find this fairly easy with a few challenging words. It is a light story about a bear who wakes up (from assumed hibernation) in time to prepare for Christmas with his animal friends. He is still so sleepy, his friends try all sorts of things to keep him awake. Staying up for Christmas is something most children yearn to do, so they should identify with the theme. It is a very simple storyline with very simple rhyming verses. The artwork is okay but not memorable. There are better books out there, especially Christmas stories that have more depth, detail and superior art work. That is why I cannot give it a higher rating. What is winning about this one is its length and simplicity. It is an ideal bedtime story, very short and sweet. Perfect for a parent or grandparent bonding experience."
3,"Great book, with it's focus on Santa.","Love all the books about Bear and his friends. I do feel this book is lacking, because the focus is on Santa Claus and not one mention of the real meaning of the holiday. Just a cute story, but will not be reading my children this as a part of our Christmas tradition. Will stick with other titles that are just as adorable, but capture the true meaning of Christmas for the children.A great book: The Something Wonderful, by Karen Hill"
2,"didn't receive what was shown, but a generic","The product (battery) says FOR QU-3225/KY414, not KYO (kyocera). I believe this is a generic and should have been stated as so on the ad. I don't like misrepresentation."
5,Agatha Christie's Poirot: The complete series,"If a person likes high class and very well written mysteries, like Agatha Christie's books coming alive, then this is one series a person should invest in. David Suchet does a wonderful and sometimes very funny Poirot, who is always in control and consumate detective. The stories are intelligent, riveting, and interesting. I highly recommend anything Agatha Christie starring David Suchet."
5,good,"If you like the little Belgium, you will like this one. He is a great actor. We enjoyed it very much. It got our little grey cells working."
5,Best way to clean a pistol period.,Feeds in from the back of the gun and efficiently cleans without damaging the crown of the barrel. Takes about 5 to 10 seconds to complete.
4,"Customer picture is misleading, beware!!!","If you think you're getting a liquid cleaner with the rope, this is not the case. All you get is the rope, you have to buy the actual solvent separate. That's the only reason I'm giving 4 stars, amazon should delete the misleading pictures."
4,Hoppes Bore Snake,"Works great. At first when ordering you look at the pictures they show on the site, it seems that it come with the liquids. IT DOES NOT. These pictures should be removed. But great product anyways."
5,Perfect tool,"Allows you to clean the barrel efficiently without compromising integrity of the barrel. Highly recommended. For those who are new to cleaning your 9mm, will find this tool indispensable."
5,Great idea,"This is an unexpected shape, design and material for what I was looking for. Glad someone came up with this good idea."
5,I wish I could have thought of this!,"I wish I would have thought of this. Whoever did is making a fortune I'm sure. I am from the old school ways of gun cleaning. Like a ritual, you get out the gun cleaner, the Q-Tips, the oil, the brushes, the bore cleaner that has to be screwed together, and you make an hour of the process. Not any more! The bore snake works wonderfully. Feed the leading end through and pull, it's that easy. Out with the old and in with the new. I would highly recommend to anyone who is avid shooter."
5,Love the BoreSnake!!,"We've used these for our shotguns for years and they work just as well for the 9mm. We haven't used it for any other caliber, though, so I can't speak for those."
5,Bore snake cleaning system works!,"Fine gun cleaning tool. Works well and not too hard to use once one learns to lube the first foot as it enters the barrel. Leverage is the key to easy passes through the barrel. I pass through the ""slug"" then stand on the tag end and guide the larger end and lift the gun away from my foot. This works very well. Does a fantastic and fast job of barrel cleaning and conditioning!"
5,Time saver,"Clean your bore with one or two passes of a snake....or take a dozen or more patches. Your choice, the decision is clear."
5,Love the BoreSnake,"Love the BoreSnake. Bought more than one and will likely buy more.The best (actually the only) way to clean a bore for me.Great product/Great Price. Ron in Sanford, NC"
5,Exactly what I wanted,The order was shipped on time and all paperwork was included with proper packaging. Hard to find item near where I live so glad this was so easy.
3,Good for a quick bore cleaning at the range,"This is not a substitute for powder/lead/copper solvent, patches, a bore brush and elbow grease but it's a quick way to do a fair cleaning at the range. There's nothing magical about the Bore Snakes. They will remove loose particles from the bore and, maybe, loosen some of the carbon from an afternoon of shooting. But a really dirty gun will take more than a few swipes with the Bore Snake to get it really clean. It's a good product for its purpose but it will not perform miracles."
4,GREAT!,"Thought long and hard about getting either a boresnake or the ram rod kits.Glad I went with the boresnake!In one pull I cleaned,lubed and protected my bore.It doesnt get easier than that!I first sprayed some Breakfree CLP in the bore,let it sit for a minute and used the snake.The bore looked brand new on only one pass so I didnt do it again.Mind you I bought this gun used and it had been used by previous owner ALOT and had about a years worth of dirtiness inside.The ffl himself told me that the guy that sold it to the shop admitted he hadnt cleaned it in 2 years just to see how long it would go before acting up and he shot it EVERY weekend religiously...impressive.I now carry a boresnake for all my calibers in my rangebag.Can't beat it.....I HIGHLY recommend to anyone!"
5,BoreSnake,This item works very well and is well made. It is use for six bb rifles at a renaissance fair. It is used a lot and it cleans well.
5,Fast and easy clean!,What else do I need to say? It's the easiest way to clean a gun. Don't bother with the rod.
5,"Work smart, not HARD!","this Bore Snake is awesome... cuts the cleaning time in half! We use it on our .22 revolver from the 40's and I can clean that in less than 5 min... Some of the semi-autos take a little longer, but it is still significantly quicker than the old way! A must have!"
5,Awesome product....,Don't know how I cleaned my pistol(s) before buying this. Makes cleaning the barrel and cylinders of my revolver a breeze. I've since bought another one for my .45 auto. This accessory belongs in everyone's range bag or cleaning kit!
5,Better than a patch and jag,"Extra quick, extra efficient. Not much else to say. I recommend you get one for every caliber and every gun"
3,It does work,"I used the boresnake to clean a 357, 38, and a 9mm. I ran the snake through each barrel or cylinder several times. Looking down the barrels it appeared nice and clean but a run through of a traditional patch and oil combo resulted in a still dirty patch. This will get the heavy dirt but can not replace a thorough cleaning with patches and cleaner/oil. I usually clean my guns after every shooting session but I might switch to every other time and use these in between since they do get a majority of the build up and are much quicker."
5,Excellent product,I was surprised by how quickly and thoroughly this product cleans. I wish there was something that would make cleaning the rest of the gun as easy.
3,works ok,"the bore snake is good for quick cleaning, but if you have any real fouling build-up still need the old cleaning rod and patches."
4,Buick GN,This is a great model car. It is very detailed in many ways. I would highly recommend this model car kit as a must have collectalbe.
3,"Not bad, but not great","When I first purchased this CD I was disappointed with the choice of puzzles. Although they are fun, only two of them are actually challenging (Line up & Finty Flush). After a while I got very bored with ""Jewel Thief"" and ""Rat Porker"". However, after a hard day at work the games are good stress relievers because of their simplicity. Because of this factor I give the package 3 stars."
3,"A nice time killer, but lacking in real depth","After having this game for several months, I regularly play only one of the games. Several of them are quite confusing, even with the pop-up hints. Some are just too cute for their own good.If you're looking for simple, short games, this software will do fine. If you're a serious puzzle person, get Pandora's box instead."
2,Not packed full of entertainment,There were only onw or two games I found to keep my attention. It lacks a bit of excitment and I'm not hard to excite.
4,Seagat FreeAgent Go 120GB is good because,"it works right out of the box. Software is installed in the product.Simply put, it is a real plug and play. I was impressed. It worked first time and every time.Only negative: I saw the price at Fry's a week later was $10 or $15 lower.If you need backup, buy Seagate."
2,Never judge a book...,"At first I was thrilled by the price and size since 120GB hard drives are difficult to come by but upon delivery, boy was I dissappointed. First off the product had several scrapes and dents which is something a hard drive, as sensative as it is, should not have. Then upon connection to several computers, Macs and one PS3 all consoles failed to detect it while making an annoying beeping noise. And lastly the connection itself, on the hard drive side, was very loose and had to be held manually just to get power into the hard drive.... very frustrating!!"
4,Nice external hard drive,Nice compact drive. I had trouble getting the bundled backup software to recognize documents from all user profiles on the laptop. I downloaded a third party backup program and it works perfectly. Its great to finally have the peace of mind that our pictures and music are safe from a hard drive failure.
4,FreeAgent Go is Good!,"I feel much better prepared for my next hard drive crash now! But, for those like me who at least slightly techno-challenged, more instruction would have been good. My goal with this purchase was to back-up my entire hard drive. I thought I could do this all at one time, but I couldn't make that happen. Instead, I had to transfer files piece by piece. I'm hoping that if I should need to recover from a crash, that my registry and everything else is maintained.It was fairly easy to download the software from the FreeAgent and then the programs and files from my C-drive. - I had an initial problem, but solved it quickly.A little ease in the transfer would make this an easy 5!Beckie"
1,False Advertisement,"You have to buy their special software to put your programs on it. This is curiously left out of their statements on the package. Even with this software, it is a 50/50 chance the application will run correctly. Basically, it is an external hard drive cluttered with the remnants of a failed attempt at a portable desktop application. Very disappointing."
3,Condition of book,"I was disappointed in the condition of the book ""Maine Charm String"". I don't recall the stated condition but it is very worn at best."
4,A good laugh à la FMP!,"Don't expect an actual rerun of the original FMP manga (or novel for that matter). This one emphasize more of the comic aspects of FMP! than the one done by Tetsu Tateo. The graphics are more comic-like and the plot not as complicated (think FMP: fumoffu). But don't get me wrong, it is still a good laugh. Sousuke is as much of a war-maniac as he can be (or maybe even more) while Kaname gets even more exasperated as ever and that's what really shines up in this new take of this popular serie. Don't miss it if you're a fan of FMP! (or not) and you liked the funny side of FMP!."
3,WOW IT'S A PANIC AND A OVERLOAD WATCH OUT!!!!,I thick this one was alright it had no point thow. Just alot of bombs!!!!! I thick kids will like it thow i gese
5,Some of Lou Rawls' Finest Work ...,I've been a Lou Rawls fan since he sang with Sam Cooke and this album is amoung his best work. Buy it.
5,Took a great album and made it excellent!!!,"I am gald that they FINALLY released this LIVE! album as a CD. It took years, and it was almost worth the wait. They to a classic piece of musical history and not only made it new, but made it better by including some new dialogue, but a little; enough to make it worthwhile to buy the CD, even if you already have the album. Also the mastering of this CD is excellent too, of course. Enjoy!!"
4,Beautiful but strange,"The eerie illustrations are strangely appealing. However, I found the end to be anti-climatic."
3,eeh,"This isn't the worst game I ever played, but it isn't the best either. in short its slow paced, simple, the story is good, and the voices for the characters suck. This game is the best I've played outside of the Final Fantasy, Star Ocean, and the Xeno series games, I give it that."
4,"Can't beat the original, but this comes close","I bought this game for a friend and ended up playing it with him. I loved the original Brave Fencer, but this game brought a new dimension to the whole thing. Not as cool of a story line as the original but still fun."
4,fun,"musashi: samurai legend was square enix's best game yet. which has tons of action, and the graphics is mad gangsta. so get this game if you love cel shading games."
4,Relaxing,Massages sore muscles on the spot! It arrived very quickly after ordering. Works great! Perfect after a hard day of work.
1,very disappointing,I did not receive this cd and this is the third time that i have order something from amazon.com and did not receive it. I will not be using this site again.
1,Skin attack,"Developed maddening rash from a very small amount. The cologne smells great, but watch out if you think you have any susceptibility at all to what I imagine was an allergic reaction."
2,Not his masterpiece,"If you have read Murakami before, you will find that Dance Dance Dance is not his masterpiece. The story is long and boring, the main character is pathetic and full of self pity and the plot is a mixture of previous books. If you have never read Murakami I suggest you start with A Wild Sheep Chase, which is by far his best book."
1,"This is not a translation, but almost another book!","""Dance, dance, dance"" is one of my preferite book and I like to collect it in different languages.Unfortunately the book in this version has been so heavily and bad cut(several pages) that is making me wondering:- did the author really approve this version?- can be still considered a translation of the original book?While I still love this novel, I suggest to whoever interested in it to looking for another translation."
2,Lamest Murakami I have read,"I read Sputnik Sweetheart and loved it.I read South of Border and it was ok.First 200 pages of Dance Dance Dance were interesting, and I read last 100 just to see ending, which is disapointing .I don't recommend book to anyone."
3,dance...to what music ?,"Technically this is my first book by a Japanese author and Japanese culture has always fascinated me. The book starts on a promising premise...and has an intriguing and intriguingly simple protagonist. He seems like a loner, has spartan habits and long philosphical discourses with himself. Where the book loses me is the entire science fiction/surreality of the story, the premise. Some ghoulish Sheep Man, some wierd 13 year psychic girl...towards the end, I was flipping pages just to see if Mr Protagonist will solve the riddles he presents, in some very insightful ways, and interesting interpretations of his reality."
1,Flaccid.,"No plot or direction in the slightest. An absolutely flaccid dribble of a story that neither leads, nor eventually goes anywhere, don't hold your breath for a climax or you might ""disappear"" like the indecipherable characters and their never explained connections to each other. An absolutely horrible, dribble, of a book."
3,Return to the Dolphin Hotel,"I would probably have been more impressed by ""Dance, Dance, Dance"" if I hadn't read several books by Murakami before. I felt that this was a mediocre book by his ususal standards, which of course doesn't mean that it was bad - far from it.The book is a contintuation of ""A Wild Sheep Chase"". The nameless narrator returns to the Dolphin Hotel in Sapporo and a series of events, including murder, ensues. The usual Murakami mannerisms (e.g., food, brand names) are there, and the conclusion is, as always, open-ended and ambiguous.My main objection is that the mid-section of the novel, especially the trip to Hawaii, didn't do much for the story."
5,The story lives up to the title,"A Wild Sheep Chase had me out the door on my way to pick up this sequel before I had even finished, causing much worry among those sharing the road with me as I read and drove. Murakami's tightly woven loose story continues to descend and ascend through the shadows of everyday life and explore the ambiguities and absurdities of the world. This is an incredible blend of comedy, metaphysics, detective stories, and horror, with plenty of other spcies added along the way.The story reminds me of ball lighning or swamp gas--a bizarre anomoly you cannot explain and may not fully fathom, but are endlessly delighted by."
4,Just nice!,"Well it's more than nice, sometimes Dance Dance Dance can be a little overwhelming on the fantasies, but i like it. Bizzare but still normal. I especially like how Murakami makes all the connections connect. He's got some nice sense of humor. And it leaves you with just the nice pleasant feeling."
4,A beginners view of Murakami,"This was my first Murakami novel. It took me some time to get the hang of his style. I found it strange and compelling, full of atmosphere, a nice surprise. It has been a long time since that last happened to me."
3,"Slow at first, but a good twist of the mystery formula.","Murakami takes the hard-boiled mystery and gives it a post-modern, jokey twist. The first half of the novel is almost unbearably slow, as it takes too many pages to set up the story. But the characters are fascinating and the story becomes compelling in the second half. It is very hip and sly; it mocks the genre gently."
1,"Boring--Compared to the ""Sputnik Sweetheart""","The book starts out boring. Plan on it: the entire first third of the book is nonsense. When the action does start, it brings up the following concepts: we will all die; young people's lives are crumpled by the society and their parents; like any other living organism, we--the humans--have to dance to the life's tune to survive. If you are interested in Murakami, this is not the right book-; you can read the ""Sputnik Sweetheart,"" or the ""South of the Border..."" The latter is actually my favorite, as it seems to be talking about real people's lives and feelings."
5,So far so good!,"This is the third Murakami novel I have read and they just keep getting better and better. This book is full of interesting twists and turns, but with a mix of fantasy that keeps you on your toes. I haven't finished it just yet, but I am sure I won't be disappointed."
4,Nice sequel...,"Well, what can I say? It's Murakami.... I love Murakami, but I have to admit having a sequel, to me, is somewhat anti- Murakami (but of course I had to read it anyways).It's a good book, written in a way that you don't have to have read Wild Sheep Chase to understand it, but I would recommend it so you have more background story (and I liked Wild Sheep Chase way more). This is probably the most literal Murakami book I've read... it has an actual ""ending"" (but not a cool one like Hardboiled Wonderland) and you're mind isn't spinning with questions afterwards, which is somewhat disappointing. Or maybe it's because I've read so many of his books that I'm starting to get bored of it...Someone once said that the first Murakami book you read (the one that got you hooked) will always be your favorite one, and it's true because my favorite is still Kafka on the Shore, so of course I would recommend that one instead :P"
3,"Good, but a bit ""samey""","Not a bad book but it is a bit like an amalgam of some of his earlier and more accomplished works. Most of it feels reashed from other novels or ended up being used used to better effect in later works such as ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"" (which I read before reading ""Dance, Danc, Dance""): the same lost and unmaterialistic narrator out of touch with his surrounding enviroment that likes to cook, had a cat and a wife but not so anymore, the befriending of a female teenager with an unsual sensitivity to the world around her, the intrusion of the surreal in the mundane through a specific cathaliser, etc etc. If you read 5 of his books there is nothing new for you on this one. I still think ""Hardboiled Wonderland And The End Of The World"" to be his best and still stands as his most original when compared with the rest of his body of work."
4,Very satisfying,"I have finished four of Murakami's works and I found this to be the most compelling and rewarding. I did not know that this was a sequel to A Wild Sheep Chase when I started it, but it soon became obvious. I found the resolution at the end of this novel much better than Hard Boiled or Wind Up Bird. This book ended with hope for me, but Wind Up Bird really started to drag a bit half way through and I didn't like the surrender to darkness that ended Hard Boiled - although it was a brilliantly executed work. Read a Wild Sheep Chase first."
5,The Perfect Dream,"5 stars doesn't do justice to this novel. It has been some six months since I put the book down and it shall be many, many years before I pick up another book that will catch my imagination so. Despite what other reviewers have written, I say that this is the finest of Murakami's works. No questions. That's all.Never before have I felt so enveloped by a written work. It kept me warm during the cold weeks of a Japanese January and the very mention of this novel or it's author sends me scurrying back to my blankets, on my futon, inside my futon closet (of all places). Emerging from this novel was like emerging from the most perfect of dreams. A worthwhile meal. A delicious Christmas."
4,enjoyable surreal weirdness; amongst Murakami's best,"Haruki Murakami mostly writes books that fall into two categories: either the 'confused but in love' bucket, or the 'confused young man finds himself totally weirded-out' bucket. The first category has Murakami classics such as 'Norwegian Wood' and 'South of the Border, West of Sun', and the latter has 'A Wild Sheep Chase' and 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle'. 'Dance, Dance, Dance', being a sequel to 'A Wild Sheep Chase', is about as weird as anything published by Murakami. And it is about as good, ... which is to say it is very good indeed.It is very hard to explain the novel since the story is so .. strange, convoluted, surreal, etc. We have altered realities, a 13 year old spoilt girl with precognition powers, and a befuddled young Japanese man caught in the middle. It all works, sort of. Believable? Not even close.Bottom line: a book best enjoyed by seasoned Murakami readers. Fans will love it."
4,"Great Book , so so translation","After I read Dance, Dance, Dance from cover to cover and over and over in Japanese. I find that it is exciting the translation version is available. First of all, I must gave the credit to the translator, who did its best to translate the ""thinking"" of the writer, not just word-to-word conversion. However, it is hard and often impossible to translate the culture and racial mind-set into different language. For the English version, it lack of excitement and sadness of what I proceeded from the original version."
3,What Youth Ministry is at all?,"I thought this book worths for a Youth Ministry conference, in my expanding ideas about youth ministry, it raised up the greater issues to think in a very complete youth ministry. As this is a compendium, some essayers tried to put their own areas in the first thing to worry in a Youth Ministry as other writers simplified very much their ideas as far as they had not enough space to put all he would tell. This is what we usually find in Youth Ministry conferences isn't it? But after reading it I have a clear vision of what to achieve in short, medium and long terms"
1,The Worst,"OMG! I bought this book because I was bored at the airport, and it just made my flight that much worse. This book was absolutely horrible and i had to force my self read every page of it."
1,bad conclusion,"The story was all over the place. The character development was very weak. The new characters that were introduced in this book just didn't draw you in, so you felt indifferent about them. Even Belladonna's love interest was kind of blah. I'm a big fan of Anne Bishop but this ending fell so flat and was disappointing. I found myself rushing to finish just to get it over with. It's a shame the series ended so poorly, it had such great potential."
3,Easy read,"I loved Anne Bishop's Black Jewels trilogy, so I was hoping for another great set. I probably would have really liked this had I not already read the Black Jewels trilogy. Having said that, it was OK. A lot of similarities to both the Black Jewels and the other set she's written, but I didn't think the characters were thought out as well. The world was a bit confusing, and hte plot was a bit predictable. But it was still entertaining, which is why I bought it. Not great, but I'm not sorry I bought it."
5,Loved it.,"Really enjoyable read. Not as good Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy, but, I've never read anything that was! As always, Anne Bishop creates a unique and unexpected world with strong, conflicted characters.I wish it had been expanded into a three book series. I really thought there was more to the story than two books allowed. The end (no spoiler here, folks) was a interesting twist on the evil Eater of the World... clever and strange."
3,a little disappointed,"The first book in this series was excellent, I couldn't put it down. This one was confusing and no where near as good as the first book. I hope the next book in this series is back up to her usual standards."
1,Disappointed,"I'm a fan of Anne Bishop, especially her Black Jewels 'verse. Sebastian - the first book in this set - was lukewarm, but I've noticed that about the first book in a Bishop series. The book tends to be lots of explication, without much in the way of action, with main characters having only cameos or minor characters trying to carry the plot.I was looking forward to Belladonna....and to be honest, I'm still waiting. The plot was as thin as mist, the characters were static and didn't react well with one another, almost like they were in the same book only by happenstance.The ending came out of nowhere. The story trudged along for a while, then WHAM and the reader is left asking 'did you get the number of that bus that just hit me?'I love the Black Jewels 'verse, and the second and third books in the Tir Alain series, but Belladonna and Sebastian should definetly have been sent back for re-writes."
3,Kinda Confusing but Good Book,Let me start out by saying that I absolutely love Anne Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy. But this book just left something to be desired. I do not feel the connection to these characters as I did to others in her books. Even Sebastian had characters that I remember and relate too. I don't know if Belladonna is too cold or if the world is just too confusing but I just cannot give this book high marks. The ending was not as well wrapped up as I could have hoped and I just think there are to many unresolved characters. I am waiting with bated breath for the next Black Jewels books...I hope she brings back the familiar character feeling that seems to be lacking in this book.
4,"Same Series, Different Title","Well, I enjoyed this sequel toSebastian (Ephemera, Book 1)- again, Bishop displays her consistently wonderful writing. Although the sensuality here has been toned down from her other novels.My only real problem with this book is that it's the same story as theThe Black Jewels: Trilogy: Daughter of the Blood / Heir to the Shadows / Queen of the Darkness. Well, with less interesting characters, unfortunately. The conflict is a little different from the other series, but the resolution is exactly the same. Which worked so well the first time I read it in the Black Jewels trilogy, but a second time around... it is... somewhat lacking now. it Although one real benefit is that it definitely solved the problem of what to read next - there is a reason Bishop's first series is her most successful and it has been some time since I last re-read it, so that's what I'll read - and heartily enjoy - next!"
2,Lackluster at best,"While the first book (Sebastian) held some promise for this story, Belladonna was lacking. The mighty Eater of the World was pretty impotent. The world itself consisted of a couple islands and a few small towns."
3,Read Sebastian First,"I love Anne Bishop's work. Once I discovered the Dark Jewels I decided to read every novel she's written. Although I enjoyed ""Belladonna"", I found it confusing. I can not imagine anyone being able to follow the story line and characters of ""Belladonna"" without first reading Sebastian, which was a terrific book with wonderful characters."
2,Full of errors,"I know this has already been said, but this book is TERRIBLY riddled with errors, at least one per page. Many are easy to spot if you are a relatively conversant spanish-speaker just looking for a refresher, but it would be horrible for someone new to the language who doesn't know to be wary.The grammar explanations are okay, I wouldn't go farther than that though. Also, the vocabulary section in the back (which, admittedly, isn't the focus of the book) uses a lot of regional terms without saying which region uses those terms, rendering it all but useless.Honestly, I'd be a bit embarrassed if I were the publisher, editor or author for putting out a book that looks like it has never been edited. Overall, it is just NOT a good resource."
5,Sweeping Ambient Music,"Spare without being empty, electronic without being cold, this is an excellent collection of ambient music by Kourosh Dini. Its 15 songs look at the human life cycle from conception to death. This is the perfect CD to put on late at night while relaxing and contemplating after a long day. The songs, and the album, progress and evolve and unfold gradually in sweeping and expansive tones reminiscent of Brian Eno's best work.In the interests of full disclosure, I'll mention that Kourosh is a friend of mine--but he's only a friend because I heard him performing at an open mic night, and because I enjoyed his music so much that I wanted to introduce myself and buy a copy of his work. He's an immensely talented musician, I've greatly enjoyed listening to his music, and I look forward to his future releases."
4,Pleasantly spicy!,"I had earlier enjoyed Harissa Olive flavored oil. It added a nice, albeit rather gentle, heat when I used it with cheese for a delightful little snack. Heartened by that experiwence, when I saw this tube of Harissa hot sauce in a tube, I ordered the product.It adds a nice edge to food onto which I squeeze some of the sauce. I normally prefer more heat than this, but the end result is pleasant enough.So, I report that my investment in this product has paid off. A little milder heat than I prefer, but still a tasty add on."
1,Never again,"I've been into harissa for the last 2 years after reading about it in a recipe and been hooked since. Recently purchased this one because of the great price but that should've told me something. After receiving it I used in on a rice dish and I was disappointed in the flavor, oiliness and paste like constancy. I looked at the ingredients and the first thing listed was VEGETABLES???? I've learned that the main ingredient in harissa should be 'red chili peppers' not vegetables! I learned vegetables are used as a filler to make more product. Not buying this product ever again."
4,love it must have,great product always better to have and not need than to need and not have. a little smaller than I thought
5,The best thing for outdoor cooking or emergency preparedness,"I love the Volcano. The Volcano is unmatched in its ability to use propane, charcoal or wood. Its miserly too.. as few as 12 briquettes will cook a meal less if you use the optional lid. I love the fact that it collapses..and can be easily stashed in my jeep for anytime use. Easy to set up. Easy to use. Easy to clean up. I think it is terrific.Volcano II Collapsible Cook Stove with Propane"
5,Perfect,"Just got it, already love it! One thing I have learned and did not find online before purchase, the propane burner is designed for a 5 gallon tank, not a 1 pound tank. You can purchase separately an adapter for that. Also the propane difuser rack can have a pot placed directly on top of it, negating the need for the also add on sale item another grill rack."
3,MEDIOCRE AT BEST,"this sticker book is inexpensive, i realize that, so i was not expecting tons of stickers, but only 4 pages?? and the stickers are big, like 2"" x 2"" big so that's not very many stickers for the money. i would not recommend this sticker book."
4,Creative Fun,"My 10 year old daughter loves getting the Ultimate Sticker books. They are nice because they not only have several stickers to place throughout the book, they also have information about the subject."
3,Not what you'd expect.,Not very many pages. Not much for the price. I've found much better for less cost. But okay.
1,disappointed,Product was very expensive and had very few stickers.The description had charecters that were not even in the book.Book is extremely small and only 2 pages of stickers.For the price it was not worth it!
2,Get the Dictionary,"Perhaps it's due to the fact this book was translated from French to English, but it's impossible to read. Somewhere, either something was lost in the translation, or else the author just wants to torture the reader with words and references that can only make you feel dumb. Get the dictionary and a good reference to obscure literature, you'll need them.There is some pretty good info in here, but I don't think this book is geared towards the typical Halloween reader. There's lots of info on pre-Christian pagan practices, which is Markale's strong point, but I found that he often got sidetracked into talking about pagan lifestyles instead of staying focused on the subject at hand... Halloween.Being that it takes the average person (me being average, I guess lol) 2+ minutes to digest one page, I can't suggest trying to read this book. Try the infintely more reader-friendly ""Halloween, An American Holiday, An American History"" by Lesley Pratt-Bannatyne."
1,Does not cover the expected circuits as expect by its title.,"This book doe not cover the expected circuits such as transmitters, bugs and such devices as one would expect from the title. The citruits it reveals are uninteresting and bland and are more interested to a hobbiest than for surveylance."
1,Don't bother !!!,"Once again, our friend at Paladin Press have done it again. They have produced / published a very substanded book, and then attempt to flog-it to the public with all the enthusiasm and zeal of a politician up for re-election. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. There are plenty of good books on this subject, this book is most certainly not one of them !"
2,Crumbling Edges!,"Ok I got these tools through my school book store, and they seemed pretty nice. In defence of these tools I do like the U gouge and i havn't yet had problems with the strait edged ones. BUT...The v gouge is terrible! It comes with a terrible angle for cutting ( your hand has to be pretty much verticle) and while reshaping and sharpening it just started to crumble away! Now I know this was not something I did because I had my teacher ( college professor/Practicing print maker) sharpen them for me! She said the temper on the steel must be bad. I have also noticed what seems to be cracks or deep scratches along the sides of the steel on my u gouge and v gouge. I think this may be part of the reason my v gouge crumbled away to uselessnes. The u gouge is still hanging in there but i don't know how long that will last. So now you have been warned!"
1,Disappointed,The metal on one of the gouges broke in half on a basswood carving. This should never happen with this type of soft wood. I was doing regular removal of wood when it snapped. Disappointed because I was planning to use it a lot during my vacation carving sessions.
2,wood carving set,"I was disappointed with the fact that I could only use three of the cutting tools because two of them had broken tips. I really wish that I would have ordered this set from a professional supply site--I even paid a few bucks more for the convenience of one payment for another item. I won't do that again. They might be o.k. for linoleum, but not for wood like I needed them for."
1,OMG!,"This is one if the worst books I have ever read, no kidding. The plot is boring, the characters are the epitome of un-pleasant and dis-likeable, I rooted for the vilians to win (giant uber-nasty magic space bug thingies). Oh, and the whole world, no universe, no creation, NO MAGIC IT SELF is threatened! (Gasp) If you are masochistic, this books for you!"
4,Stories for the soul,"If you are a fan of the Chicken soup books, You'll love Black-eyed peas for the soul, a collection of inspirationl, and stories of hope from african americans of every wake of life."
3,Works in a pinch.,"Jell-O Butterscotch Puddin' is good and works in a pinch. I highly recommend buying it in the Puddin' Packs. Believe me, I am a Butterscotch Puddin' Connoisseur. When you buy it in the packs, it is soooo smooth. When I buy the instant and make it, it usually turns out a little grainy.-Offgar"
1,Its not a 6 pack,The product page is very misleading. Its not 6 pack. I ordered it and got only one in the shipment.
5,quick delivery,Can't find this in the stores locally anymore so was happy to find it on the internet.Order came quick. Thanks
2,High Tide,"I liked the story line and decided not to wait for the paperback. The story was a bit incomplete. Things were left out, sort of like parts of chapters were missing. People were not thought out. If you read Taggart story line you will more than likey read the book but wait you won't be missing anything."
2,MYSTIFIED,"What is it about Jude Deveraux's books that leave me cold - I mean other than poor writing and inane dialogue? This is the third book I've read by JD (over several years) and once again I feel I've wasted my money. Granted this ""High Tide"" didn't get too many glowing reviews (and I haven't checked the reviews of the other two books I read), but I think from now on I will pass on her books. There are too many great authors writing now whose work demand respect and their stories deliver, if not every time, almost every time. Buyer beware."
2,Not a Keeper,"I read this book a few years ago. Now I am clearing off my shelves preparing for a move. The reviews are extreme, but I know I did not enjoy this book. So, to the donation pile it goes!! I do like other books by JD, though."
2,High Tide,"I usually love Jude Deveraux's books, but this one was NOT one of her best. Although the love story between Fiona and Ace was good, the whole plot was a little sketchy. It didn't reveal enough of the story to draw me in. This was no ""Knight In Shining Armor"", that's for sure."
1,I'm very disappointed.,"There are only a few writers whose new books I wait for with eagerness and Jude Deveraux is one of those writers. I have always enjoyed the way her books flow, the romance involved, and the wonderful plots (A Knight In Shining Armor and Sweet Liar spring immediately to mind). I couldn't find any of those attributes in this book, however. I've never been so confused about the characters in a book, and in this one I did a lot of wondering which character was which and who did what to whom. The story line jumped from place to place so fast that my head was spinning. I thought perhaps I had read it too fast the first time and slogged my way through a second reading, but came away with the same sense of disappointment as I did after the first reading. This is not a book I'm going to keep or read again. I'll be selling it at my next garage sale."
3,The Alligator scene was promising but...,"Who's Kimberly? Kimberly is...a pain in the arse!Since about 40 pages are spent on her you'd think she was the main character. Considering that, she really does have more depth in her glassy eyes then Fiona has in her entire 6'0 frame as she flounces and pouts through page after page. Ace is no ace with me. I like my heroes somewhat smart and considering he was engaged to a dim witted blond who anyone could tell he wasn't really in love with (since hot potatoe style he ditched her for an equally whiny heroine, Fiona) makes me question his intelligence. Both of his girls'(Fiona and Lisa) also seem to dislike the swamp-a world Ace adores, which makes me wonder how much of his attraction to Fiona is just lust rather then love.I suggest The Taming and The Conquest by Jude Deveraux instead. Or may I suggest Judith McNaught and Karen Marie Moning."
2,Poor example of Jude's work,"This book was a big disappointment to me as well. I am a big fan of Jude's, and dont mind paying full price for her books if I have to...but this was not worth the money in paperback and certainly not in hardback(if it came that way.)...Confusing and convoluted mystery, minor romance, minor humor(where she usually shines)unresolved dilemmas, no continuity. I would almost say this was written by somebody else!! I certainly hope the next one will be back to her old form."
2,Not her best,"Somehow this book did not catch my fancy. I can ignore some large plot holes, but this story had huge canyons in it. I loved the various stories of the Montgomerys and the Taggerts, but this one is not up to her usual interesting style."
4,Not as bad as everyone says...,"I've read most of JDs books and I feel that some of them (especially the contemporary ones) are reviewed unfairly. High tide is one of them. Yes the secondary characters were unnecessary but the dialog between Fiona and Ace was witty and humorous. True, there isn't that much romance until towards the end, but I personally like to see how the relationship grows rather than just jumping into it."
1,Not up to Jude's usual standards!,"I have read nearly every book written by Jude Deveraux...some, like A Knight in Shining Armor and Highland Velvet, are among my very favorite books of all time. Although I have not loved everything she has written, I have always enjoyed reading a new release from Jude. Until High Tide. The story, at its most basic level, had potential but the execution of said story was abysmal. Ridiculous plot twists, trite and uninspired dialog and an insultingly mindless storyline...in short, don't waste your time!"
3,Not a keeper......,"Funny, frothy, predictable, light-hearted fare. No remiscences of classics like Knight In Shining Armor. Wait! That's wrong- the same kind of humour is in both books. Ace and Fiona are the stereotypical, bickering H & H but they are endearing. And their dialogue back and forth has lots of zip and crackle. Try High Tide - you'll like it today - but you won't remember it tomorrow."
2,2.5 stars - in terest ing,"this book was interesting, only because it was crafted by jude deveraux's magnificent wit. fiona seemed a little full of herself. ace was your typical romantic hero. if you want a good jude deveraux read, pick up ""THE DUCHESS"" and you will NOT be disappointed."
1,Fans of Jude Deveraux - Don't Read!,"I have every one of Jude Deveraux's books that are out on bookstands so far... Except this one. Probably like many other Jude Deveraux fans, I want anxiously for a new book to come out and I was excited to read this one when it came to the local library. I wondered why a new Deveraux book was still on library shelves, but I didn't think much of it. I knew why when I read it... This book was horrible! I felt no connection betweent the main characters (Fiona & Ace), infact I felt disgust by them... Reading the other reviews made me realize I'm not the only one who thinks this book was not written by Jude. I'm going to add it to my collection--just to have it though--I doubt I'll ever waste the three hours again to read it. This book was trash, it should have been thrown away when being edited."
2,Better than Blessing!,"OK, OK--so this wasn't one of Jude's best books, but I have to admit that I liked it much better than the Blessing! I personally like hearing about those too perfect, too rich, too handsome, too lovely and too loving Montgomerys and Taggerts! I was glad to see the family return. I felt that I learned a bit about both Fiona and Ace, and could see how their relationship grew. I like my ends tightly knit though, and wondered if Ace's family had felt rejected by him or if he felt estranged from them because of his unusual choice of lifestyle. (I am talking about his parents here, not his cousins.) Of course, the outcome was obvious, but I want my romances to end happily. All in all though, I think that Historical romance is the genre in which Jude excells, and I wish she would return to that. (I am glad to see her leave that goofy time travel/reincarnation stuff behind!)"
4,high tide review,i loved ace montgomery but then there hasn't been a montgomery man i havent loved since the black lyon...anyway...i enjoyed this book BUT i was disappointed with the last half of it...it felt as if ms devereaux lost interest...finished the book but what could have been one of her all time best just didnt happen....i say read it you will enjoy it just dont expect a 'knight in shining armor' effort
2,"What a poor job, from such a great writter!","After hours & hours of reading pleasure, I found my self wondering if I was really reading a Jude Deveraux book. Romance/mystery/suspends is not her cup of tea, she needs to go back to what she knows. Deveraux has a Montgomery interacting with Taggerts, without another Montgomery in sight. Be for real, this family just does not roll that way. There are too many holes in this story, and no answers. Who the heck was Rose? Why would the main characters trust Susie right out of the blue? Why would four childhood friends sit in New York and wait while their friend was being hunted down for murder, and not one of them try to reach her? I have read everything Ms. Deveraux has written, but I will not buy another of her books just because she wrote it. She has been going down hill since An Angel for Emily & The Blessing."
2,Where was Jude Deveraux?,"I just want to know where Jude Deveraux was while this book was being written. If it hadn't had her name on it, not only would I have not recognized her, but I wouldn't have read past the first page. The lead characters were unlikable at best.They both had the temperament of three year olds, were uncontrollably violent, (sorry, I don't find shoving each other in anger acceptable, much less sexy), and who would have a dead person lying on top of them and wonder if they are looking sexy? The plot jumps around and contradicts. It was as if the author,(whoever that was), got tired of the whole thing and decided to end it suddenly.And, it couldn't have ended soon enough for me. C'mon Jude, we want you back! I hope this isn't the first Deveraux book someone reads, because she is usually an extraordinary author. Read my favorite, ""Wishes"", or ""Knight in shining armor"". Those are classics in the romance genre."
2,HIGH TIDE,I LOVE JUDE DEVERAUX AND THE MONTGOMERY/TAGGERT SERIES BUT FELT THAT THIS BOOK WAS NOT UP TO JUDE DEVERAUX'S NORMAL INTENSE STORYTELLING. THE CHARATERS WERE GOOD BUT THE STORY CAME TO AN ABRUPT END JUST AS WE WERE GETTING INTO THE STORY. IT NEEDED A FEW MORE CHAPTERS TO WRAP IT UP.
3,Terror in the Tropics?,"High Tide, though enjoyable, would not be my first recommendation for a Deveraux book. The characters in this book are less well-defined than they are in her other novels I've had the pleasure to read. Her ""Montgomery"" heroes are normally ""to-die-for"" types with a great sense of humor. The humor in ""Ace"", the leading male character, is lacking as well as the three dimensional qualities normally present in Deveraux's other work. The plot, while interesting, is also less in depth than I am used to seeing in her novels. High Tide would be a pleasure to read, however, if you're looking for a nice way to spend an afternoon or a day at the beach reading. If you are looking for a better example of Deveraux's writing, I may suggest A Kight in Shining Armor. That book is a gem."
2,Who is the ghostwriter?,"I have read all of Jude Devereaux' books and I can't believe she wrote this one by herself. Careful readers will see exactly the spot where she took over a good mystery story and stuck in a little bit of poorly thought out romance so she could put her name on it. It seems almost as if she collaborated with Linda Howard. I am sorry to say I not only bought this book for me, but I also gave it as a Christmas present. Never again!"
3,Not her Best by far,"This was definitely a Deveraux, had her style but not quite her flair. It was somewhat of a disappointment to wait for her new book than this be it. Good by itself but doesn't compare to other stories of hers."
2,Disappointing,"This book is definitely not up to Jude Deveraux's usual standard. The characters are contrived - almost unlikable - and the story is confusing. Deveraux attempts to write a mystery novel but leaves out many important details, causing the story line to fall apart. I suggest that the writer leave mystery tales to the adept mystery writers in the future and return to the fun and feisty romps that made her famous."
4,An Adventurous Love Story,"The High Tide by Jude Deveraux is an amazing and distinquised love story. I never really likled reading, but as I started reading this story it made me want to know more about what happened next. The novel is about a woman named Fiona who was sent to Florida by her boss to meet with a rich client. Fiona wasn't so thrilled about going on this trip because she had never left her home town of New York. But, little did she know what was in store for her. Fiona is accused of the murder of her client, her only ally is a man named Ace Mongomery, and they both fined themselves falling in love with each other while trying to solve the dangerous mystery behind the murder. Overall, this is a great book to read, and I recommend it."
3,Had Potentials,"I have every book Jude Deveraux has ever written. I always enjoy reading about the Montgomery's and the Taggert's, but this story could have been much better. I felt alot of infomation could have been added and detailed more. In the last chapters I wanted to know what happened with her brother, and the old man that was with them on the hunt for the lions.What I missed in this book was the fire, passion, funnierness, and indeptness of her past work. Also I would like to Ms. Deveraux to go back to the writings she did when she wrote the Velvet series, when she wrote about the Raider, and Twin of Ice and Fire, and the River Trilogy."
4,another great montgomery-taggert story.,"ms.deveraux does it again! i absolutely love the montgomery-taggert stories. the minute i read the preface, i knew this was a must read..."
2,Predictable and corny,"Well, my title sums it up. As I was reading it, I could predict who was going to say what next. It reminded me of a Doris Day/Rock Hudson comedy which lacked the endearing kitsch factor. It's the only book I read by the author and it turned me off for good."
3,Not her best but still enjoyable,I was very excited that Jude was writing another contemporary book. Sweet Liar was my favorite Jude Deveraux book. I enjoyed reading High Tide but it wasn't her best. I felt like she was told to cut 50 pages from the book and she took one page out of every 20. I kept looking back a page to see if I turned more than one page.If you love the Montgomeries and Jude's books you will still find High Tide an enjoyable read but you might want to wait for the paperback.
3,"Ok, but NOT one of Deveraux's best!","High Tide is ok, better than the last two books. But there were still some inconsistencies that were found in others. In the first chapter the heroines' eyes are referred to as green, yet towards the end of the book, they are referred to as 'dark'. However, to be fair, it kept me occupied for a day, while home sick. Also, I think it is unrealistic of people to demand a great story from an author every book, this one is certainly better than the last two. But it is no Knight in Shining Armor!"
1,High Tide is a Total Washout!,"I had great difficulty believing that Jude Deveraux even wrote this book. I have been an avid fan of her wonderful stories for years and have never been so thoroughly let down before. High Tide totally lacks veracity, interest, romance and the usual great storytelling that I have come to expect from Jude."
2,High Tide,"I am a huge Jude Deveraux fan, I have read all of her novels; most exceptional, some good, and a few not-so-good. Unfortunately, this falls into the not-so-good category.It was as if there were pages that were torn from the book. I would have rather read another 100 pages to get the full story than have to be satisfied with this version.I would definitely bypass this and read Sweet Liar for a second time!"
2,Disappointed Again,"Years ago I read THE DUCHESS by Jude Deveraux and enjoyed it; subsequently I have read several of her other novels and have finally decided that it is THE DUCHESS that is the fluke! HIGH TIDE is another idiotic, shallow, contrived story written for maybe a fifth grader. You have the kick a** Fiona who spends the entire novel slapping Montgomery, screaming at him, or trying to run away. Then you have the handsome Ace who (with a limitless amount of money and resources) somehow falls in love with this witchy Fiona (totally unbelievable). If you want to read something with a strong heroine, a perfect hero and a great story, turn to anything by Gabaldon (start with OUTLANDER)."
4,Not bad,"Wow, harsh words from everyone.I give this book 4 stars for two reasons:1) it made me laugh hysterically at some parts2) i'm madly in love with the Montgomerys ;)"
3,High Tide - The book did not go out when the tide came in.,"High Tide was a good book. I love the Montgomerys and the Taggerts, although they were not the main focus of this book, with the exception of Ace Montgomery and brief mentions of the Montgomerys and the Taggerts.High Tide had a lot of suspense in it. Fiona Burkenhalter, a doll designer, was a doll herself and made for Ace Montgomery. I was glad they both washed up their respective fiances' or dates and settled for each other. The suspense was throughout the book and lasted until the end. Hide Tide definitely surfed the wave and survived the tide.Deveraux fans do not give up on Jude. Keep the faith and keep on buying and reading Ms. Deveraux's books. You will not be disappointed!"
1,Very Disappointing,"Being a long time Deveraux fan, I found this book to be very disappointing. I had to keep referring to the cover to make sure it was really a Deveraux book! The story was good but the writing was disjointed. It was just not up to Jude's usual standard, historical or modern day. If this is someone's first time reading a Deveraux book and you were less than satisfied, please try again. She has written many excellant romance novels that will be worth your time."
2,Disappointed,"I have loved Jude Deveraux' books since I first picked up ""A Knight In Shining Armor"" and every book she has written about the Montgomery/Taggert clan is great and satisfying. This however, was not.The plot started off well, with Fiona as a tough-as-nails New York doll designer? And Ace Montgomery as a gorgeous swamp man? It already is tough to swallow, but I give it a try. It goes downhill from there. The plot and characters were constantly changing, with no reason and in the end, the whole thing made no sense. I was so disappointed and frustrated, that I nearly threw it out the window. I will still gladly anticipated the next novel, but I hope it's more worthy of her talent and name."
5,Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Antione Inch Thomas is a great writer.I read your book Flower's Bed and all I can say is Wow! that was a very good book I was so into it I couldn't stop reading it. The book made me Happy !!!!! sad and Mad. It is a must read !!!
2,SMH,"I guess I didn't get wht I thot I was going 2 get from this novel...the ending with Shawn was soo corny 2 me, smh.I jus don't know wht 2 say..."
4,Beautiful Cover,"The writer tugged at your heart strings with this one, he talked about something that is ill in our society and ever so present in many household across the counrty, (molestation). The things that Flower went through made you wonder would she ever recover but the luck of a friend, a caring mother and a love she never known helped build her into the strong black woman she was destined to be, you have to read this touching novel set with an urban back drop."
3,Flowers Bed Drama,"It was an ok read. I felt that they could've focused more on what was suppose to be the main topic, which was incest. The author was pretty choppy, and it seemed as if she tried to rush us through the story, to get all of her points across in such short time. I gave it a 3 because there could be more work and much ore story. I liked the ending I'm a sucker for good endings"
5,My favorite new book of 2002,"Once again, Peter Rock has fashioned a story that will haunt you long after you close the book. The writing is beautiful, as usual, for Rock. And the narrative takes such unexpected twists. A delight to read. It's like a Bunuel film set in inner city Philly. Highly recommended."
5,Another November has GREAT KARMA,"This is an awesome CD, I cannot say enough about it.The music and the lyrics blew me away. I cannot pick a favorite. All the tracks are great. This band has a TON of talent and I hope to hear them on the radio soon!"
3,Not as funny,Rodney Carrington: Live at the MajesticRead the reviews and I was disappointed. I expected funnier routine and more songs. I love Rodney Carrington just not this DVD. Sorry Rodney!
5,Rodney at his best !,"If you have not been able to watch Rodney in person, this DVD is a must.You will laugh until you cry."
5,A funny man who's not afraid to state the obvious,"Rodney is a very funny man that always puts on a great show. One reviewer noted that this is more like Rodney-light, but take note, it's still explicit in a very funny way. Keep the little kids ears far-far away!"
1,Will not play in Sony Blu Ray,I purchased this DVD to play in my Sony Blu Ray and it got thru the FBI thingy to 15 seconds and that is it. I returned it and ordered another. Same thing happened. I tried it my friends Sony Blu Ray and the result was the same. We put it into a friend's DVD player (which I do not have) and it worked.I saw clips of this show and really was looking forward to viewing on my big screen HDTV.
3,50% funny / 50% offensive,"Some of the jokes were amusing, some (concerning prejudice, etc.) were not amusing. I was also VERY offended that some women (and I use this term very politely, as another word was really more appropriate) in the audience decided to actually stand up and lift their tops and reveal bare breasts. The camera lingered on them several times. If I wanted to view that sort of thing, I would have bought a porno and not a stand-up comedy special. They should have edited that trash out. I can't even believe there are some classless trashy people that would do something so inappropriate like that in a public place. It was SO absurd! Needless to say, this is one DVD that will end up in the trash. I wouldn't watch it again."
4,rodney carrington,"this guy was so funny he needs to make more dvds, next I will have to try the cds great DVD"
4,Loved it !!,Rodney Carrington made me laugh. I would love to see him in person but this was almost as good. I have followed him for many years starting on the Bob and Tom show and he just keeps getting better.
4,Adults only,"This is the best adult humor I have found without being just dirty.Full of sexual jokles, this is one very funny guy. We watched this as a family (3 kids 18,18,19 grandma 70+ and my wife and I late 40s)and even the most sexual topics we all laughed at together. The music was the best. Only guy I know that could write a song to get women to show him their boobs. This was great fun!"
5,"Excellent, but Be Prepared for Rodney ""Lite""","We were at the venue for the filming of this DVD, and I've got to say, he put on one heck of a show. The best thing about Rodney is that he's always fresh. He very rarely uses his old bit, so each time you see him, you're in for surprises, and this one was no exception.But it seems that he has taken a bit more of a conservative path since his show on ABC. If you've heard his old albums (Laugh You [...] and Morning Wood), you will probably agree that this is a bit on the ""light"" side.Just about anything that comes out of Rodney's mouth is hilarious, but I personally came to love the guy for his complete lack of respect for anyone or anything. While ""Live at the Majestic"" and ""King of the Mountains"" (they are both from the same show) are both well-produced and extremely entertaining, they lack the level of insult that made him famous."
5,Great comedian,"Rodney Carrington is funny just to hear on cd, but to see him on this dvd I dare say was funnier. The expressions that he gives and how he carries himself adds greatly to his routine. Great for anyone over 18."
5,Rodney Carrington Live at the Majestic,"I showed this to a group of 15 friends, we all laughed so hard we cried!!! HILARIOUS!!!!!!!"
2,Definitely adult material,"Purchased this DVD after hearing Rodney on Satellite radio. Parts are funny, but the DVD is very vulgar and includes brief nudity. Definitely should be viewed by adults only."
2,Disappointment,Huge disappointment. Wasn't near as good as he is on the radio. Too much F.... words.
1,very unhappy,I really cant give you a review because I never received this movie. I ordered it back in feb. Today is March 30 and I still do not have the movie. They charged me already for it though.
2,"Great design, but poor manufacturing and poor choice of material","The design of this mousepad is very nice and stylish. The mouse area is large, and it is embedded in a plastic frame with curved edges that feel smooth on the wrist. When new, the material from which the actual, silver-colored mousing plate exerts only little friction on the mouse and yet provides good control of the mouse position. However, the material is too sensitive against scratching. This is particularly bad since the manufacturer is apparently not capable of making the surface sufficiently flat. The surface features faults -- like a curtain. While the mouse doesn't touch the valleys, it excessively wears the ridges, which then become dull and ugly-looking patches already after one day of use. I have returned my first mousepad because of this problem, but the second one has the same problem."
3,"""MacBeth"" reduced to one soliloquy?","While perhaps humorous, to say that this CD contains a translation of ""MacBeth"" into Bislama (a.k.a. south pacific Pidgin) is misleading and disappointing. The only translation is of the soliloquy ""Tomorrow""."
3,handle issues,The plastic on the handle of the fryingpan is hard and fragile. I ordered the product online and when it arrived thier was a small piece of the plastic rattling around in the box. Could be coated with the high Temperature silicone concerned that if the handle gets hot from cooking over a fire that plastic will melt. Also the handle on the Fryingpan could use some form of lock when it is open and closed. Just a notch cut out and tention from the handle would do. The pot seems to be construsted well. Fix the handle issues and it would be 5 star... I guess I got what I paid for.
2,Poor Quality,I was disappointed by the size of this combo. It also didn't seem to be of the best quality.
3,A little disappointed,"I have to admit with the high reviews I was expecting a really great cookbook. I was disappointed. Some of the recipes were extremely basic and many relied on convenience and processed foods. I prefer other Tex-Mex cookbooks, such as The Tex-Mex Cookbook: A History in Recipes and Photos by Robb Walsh."
3,"Close, but no cigar","These are cute little sponges infused with soap. At first they are like trying to wash with a rock, because there is so much soap in them. By the time they soften up, the smell and soap is gone. Actually I prefer them after they are ""empty"". Nice bath sponge, but a plain one without the soap is what I prefer."
4,brotzman's writing,"is concise enough to be understood and does lend something to the neat field of OT Text Criticism. it isnt exactly written for the expert in the field of hebrew knowledge (this is only my 4th semester of it), but the title says it all, ""a practical introduction""."
2,Very detailed,"I personally enjoyed this book but unless you absolutely love to read about textual criticism, you will probably be bored by it. There is some extremely interesting information about the Old Testament text that many are unaware of. You may want to consider this book as a resource for your theological library. It will certainly help you understand how the Old Testament came into existence."
1,Can't get rid of rut,"Oh My Goddess! was a respected comic all over the world. Beautiful cartoon, attractive character and SKULD! I was attracted cozy goddesses nonetheless fanciful situation. But at present Goddess became stereotyped. I was so fed with colorless iteration and childish story. Mr.Fujishima retired at the wrong time. furthermore I don't anticipate Goddess Movie that will be released this summer in Japan too. By the way, surprisingly goddess and New Character will appear in arcade in Japan with 3-D image! It's the end of world."
1,Might have been funny but...............,"Bad experince with this DVD. Bought this one and Rodneys Family Business DVD from this site on the same day. HOWEVER while it appearded this was a different dvd from the box cover (numbers and date produced) to the printing on the dvd I started it and it was the same exact show as Family Business. I was like WTF!!?? I wrote the seller asking for the correct one, they did not answer for 2 days and then just refunded the money paid. I was like ok got the money but you could not even try to correct it when I asked for another one? Not sure if this was just a manufacturing error or what."
2,Confused,"I am a football fan of many years and enjoy the annual magazines and books that are prevalent as early as July now. This new Pro Football Prospectus is a slick looking production, but I was surprised at the ""same old, same old"" inside its covers. There is nothing in this book I have seen I cannot find through either my own logic or in countless other magazines on the market. In truth, this book is really just another of those magazines.Coming from the FootballOutsiders, I did expect something marvelous, but unfortnately this is watered-down, typical writing with countless errors. How can a book like this be published with so many spelling errors? I am sure the players whose names are mangled throughout this book are not amused."
1,Huge Letdown,"When I saw this book on the shelves at Border's, I was excited. Having read the previous three editions, I was very much looking forward to another volume. What I did not notice is the authors had changed. Sadly, with that change comes an almost amateurish approach to what they call analysis, but I call pseudo-science.I am not sure what the motivation was for letting a two-bit dot com take over what was a fine football annual, but I sure wish I had known. Yeah, the cover is a little slicker than the previous books...but the content, in a word, sucks. Revolutionary formula? Show me one example of a formula that (a) is revolutionary, (b) makes sense, and (c) is not the worst kind of pseudo-science."
2,Not nearly as good as the Baseball or Basketball versions,"In spite of its militaristic nature, pro football is sorely lacking in publicly available statistics - especially from a historical perspective. Baseball is king in stat land, but even basketball is doing a better job - and thinkers like Dean Oliver and John Hollinger are providing philosophical breakthroughs. Sadly, Football Prospectus fails where its baseball and basketball versions succeed; in providing us new insight into evaluating individual players and teams. The book is not a pure failure, but one would think that the authors would come up with more original data (and fresher perspectives) than they have. As an alternative, I recommend the timeless HIDDEN GAME OF FOOTBALL."
3,Beautiful but crowded,The book is beautiful however I did not realize that it has pop up pictures in it. The pages for the years and Christmases are shared so you have seven years divided on two pages. It does not leave much room for pictures just a written description. I am planning on just using it as a first year book since the pages are shared and covering the other page with pictures and keepsakes. This is my third child and this is the least of my favorite Baby books. The illustrations are beautiful though or else I would return it.
2,So disappointed,"I loved the illustrations, the popups, and the vintage feel. I didn't love that there were so few categories, so little space to include things that might have been fun and interesting, and so much space dedicated to things that I felt would have been very dry and impersonal to look back on.It was so beautiful and lovely to look at. I wanted to find ways to frame some of the pictures, but as a baby memory book, it was, well, boring. I wish I could have combined the inclusion of categories like 'what was going on in the world the year you were born', 'what things cost when you were born', 'what were baby's first games/words' and such like modern books have with the lovely aesthetic of this classic looking album. I didn't end up using mine, unfortunately."
2,old-fashioned,"This baby book is a bit out of date. It has cute pop ups but it doesn't ahve a lot of different suggestions for interesting things to comment on about the new baby. I found better at Babies R Us. Also waxy pages a litte difficult to write on. If you are looking for a baby book that is just like the one you had in the 60s, this is it."
2,poorly organized,"This book is pretty, and old-fashioned looking, but the space is horribly laid out. One could fit possibly two pictures on a page, due to the illustrations and pop-ups. The Christmas/birthday pages do not give enough room to fit a standard sized photograph. The ""firsts"" page does not give ample room for more than a date and a phrase for description. Finally, a large portion of the book is relevant to only children who have a doctor for the birth, attend out-of-the-home school, and only have one page of ""memories"". I expect some of these conventional things to be in these books, but this takes up a large amount of the book, as the book is not very many pages long. The paper, as others have mentioned, is glossy and therefore writing is difficult."
1,Baby Pop-Up Book,"This book is unique in that most pages have pop-ups right at the top of the page. This makes it hard to open the book and if your child goes through it when they are older, it is likely to get ruined. It is also quite a distraction on the pages and a lot of them tend to fold over and land on the page itself. Also the pages are shiny and have a coating that if you use certain kinds of pens it smears all over the page-like the new acid free pens. Also, there is trouble mounting photo's because of the coating. It seems that photo corners do not stick very well and there really is little room for photo's anyway.That being said, the pictures are beautiful, but I found that it really wasn't very functional in terms of getting down your baby's firsts, keeping memento's and photo's in. I would have rated it 2.5 stars but it wouldn't let me change it after I had already rated it one star."
3,it's ok,"Its a beautiful looking book, i just wish it had more pages, more information. it only has about 10 pages, very general, i would have like more detailed questions, feeding.. sleeping... and so one. other then thats its very pretty"
2,not easy to use,"im a very crafty person and had a verrrry hard time using this, it made a mess and was just a pain in the ass, you def get what you pay for with this. It doesnt not look like a good fix youd be better off coloring duct tape."
3,"Forgettable 12"" Figure","I have come to loathe all things ""Prequel,"" but when the hype surrounding the (then) upcoming Episode I was at its peak, I enthusiastically bought all of Kenner's 12"" figures in the Episode I line, including this Battle Droid figure.Pros - It's detailed and has a good head sculpt and articulation.Cons - It's pretty flimsy, and doesn't pose or stand well.Despite my feelings about the movie, I have to admit these are some of Kenner's better 12"" Star Wars figures. The Battle Droid isn't an essential figure, but if you're collecting the Episode I line it's a necessary purchase."
5,BUY THESE!,these are GREAT for identifying your luggage in a very busy airport. And the grippers make it more comfortable to carry your bag. It has a space for an ID card inside for that added security and it slips through the band so it won't fall off your bag without much tampering. Love these tage!
2,Too many stories not enough hunting tecnique,"A nice book, although I found it to contain too many stories [that were entertaining] but not enough material on the hunting tecnique, which was the reason I purchased it.I liked the fact that there were a lot of Pa. local reference, although I was dissapointed that, I did not gain any new hunting knowledge. I am going to take advantage of AMAZON's satisfaction or return policy."
4,An anarcho-syndicalist view of Stirner,"Clark is strongest when he is attacking the structure of Stirner's argumentation and logic, and weakest when he injects his own syndicalist socialism (which is, to Clark, the only example of ""true"" anarchism) into the discussion. Paradoxically, however, Clark's unique perspective adds significantly to the overall value of the book as a means for understanding both the philosophy of Stirner and anarchist thought in general."
5,A critical but thoroughly competent treatment of Stirner's philosophy,"This is perhaps the best secondary source on Max Stirner currently available in book form. I learned more about Stirner in these 100 pages than anywhere else thus far. The author's treatment of Stirner is fair and incredibly enlightening. And because the author is critical of Stirner's philosophy, the sympathetic reader can proceed with the confidence that he will be able to anticipate in advance any criticism that will be levelled against Stirner, whether it be in metaphysics or ethics.I would suggest that the interested reader begin here. Next, I would recommend Mackay's biography of Stirner, followed then by another book entitled ""Individuality and the Social Organism."" James L. Walker's book ""The Philosophy of Egoism"" is also highly recommended (the book which introduced me to egoism)."
3,Time to ride = Okay game,I think time to ride is pretty fun! The graphics are okay but one thing that I can't stand are the way the horses move! When you back up the horse it looks really weird....but that most likely doesn't matter anyway. It's fun trying to solve the mystery and I really liked following Christorob or whatever his name is in the middle of the night! But I find the game immposible to complete! You have to use a wheel with different numbers and card suits and turn it to the correct combonation but I can't find ANY clues to find the correct combo! Overall it's pretty fun.
4,Very readable and informative,"Hazrat Babajan was a female qalandar, an attained Sufi who functioned outside the usual structure of a Sufi 'Order' and formal Islamic religious practice. She lived to a very advanced age (possibly in excess of 120 years) and was instrumental in the spiritual elevation of the renowned Hazrat Inayat Khan and of Meher Baba.This account of her life by Kevin Shepherd is readable, obviously informed by his personal involvement with the living tradition of Sufism (Tasawwuf), and is useful to serious students of the Way. The narrative is marred somewhat in the Introduction by the author's rant-and-rail against the materialism and profanity of postmodern society; I can't say that, on balance, I don't agree with him -- but the same thing could have been said with less ink and a more thoughtful tone.If you can get this book, it is otherwise quite worthwhile."
4,Great Live Collection-- Great Tour,"Its good to see these guys have released a collection of songs in live pure form, proving they are today's mainstream metal gods. Corey Taylor's voice though sounds like crap in a few of the songs- probably because he's singing behind a mask. The guitars sound ripe and ready, and Joey's drumming is very intense indeed. Nice job on including ""Get This"", ""Skin Ticket"", ""purity"", and of course the crowd favorite: ""Eeyore"".Choice cuts:""The Blister Exists""""Disasterpiece""""Before I Forget""""Vermillion""""Purity""""Three Nil""""The Nameless""""Skin Ticket""""Duality""""Wait and Bleed""Great CD- great collection of Slipknot.This tour was awesome as well"
3,Roadside accident : Car on Fire,"I think the reason I enjoy Slipknot is the same as why I always look at the five car pile-up accident on the freeway. For some reason, they have the same entertainment value for me. They wear fright masks and wield their instruments like chainsaws, and I can't NOT look.Their new live album is a good value for their fans. What it lacks in production value it makes up for in sheer energy. The percussion is about the best I have ever heard on a live album. The vocals, however, suffer due to the fact that Corey sounds like, ...ummm... he is singing while wearing a MASK!Gee, I wonder why the studio vocals don't sound that way? Hmmmm."
2,Stop impossing your religous views on people!,"You know, it is interesting that many good hardcore bands like Demon Hunter get outcasted and rejected from mainstream metal because of their faith; while other groups with opposing religous ideas get away with singing about it. To me, that shows who is really hardcore.Slipknot sings about the same old religous views that many of the people in this country believe, yet they are not lumped into the religous music section next to Amy Grant. Why is that?Well, I'm not joining your religion, it seems as though you have enough followers and the same religous views as Brittany Spears."
1,There really should be an option of zero stars,"Someone should tell the sissy who sings that wearing a mask muffles your voice. On second thought, that maybe is a good idea. Also, didn't the whole ""turntable scratching/metal"" thing go out years ago. I mean, that is so 1999!"
1,Not great live.,"I was told by Slipknot fans I knew that this was not a good live disc. I tried it anyway back when I used to like this band before cory taylor went ass pussy. Anyway they were right this is not a strong live band, they seem to go more on the stage show."
1,Live Slipknot,"Ever wanted to listen to Slipknot live?No, neither have I.But judging by the cover of this album, at least 6 people have.No, no. In all seriousness Slipknot aren't THAT bad. They just don't deserve anymore than 1 star. Their music is that perfect blend of metal that appears edgy and cult, yet is supremely accessible and predictable. I hear people say the band is misunderstood, or misdirected or mis-whatever. But the message ""People=SH**"" seems about as direct and understandable as can be.They do have a very good drummer though."
5,It grows on you.,"When I first popped this cd in the player, I thought ""boy this sounds crappy"". The sound wasn't as refined as studio album and Corey's voice sounded a little road worn.What this live album gives you might not be the refined perfected sound you get from a studio album but it makes up for it with loads of energy. This album gives you a different slipknot experience.Also, it get's even better if you can see that energy. I recommend watching Disasterpieces to get the whole package."
5,Delightful and Charming!,"Carnival of Saints is a story set in Renassance Italy in the year 1502. This story tracks the people in the band of Wayward Saints, a group of ragtag misfits drawn in for various reasons. Now, on to the review. This book is amazing, and I'm very upset to see that it's out of print. It has the most priceless moments... the humor is rolling on the ground-breaking your ribs type stuff. Hilarious. There are some sexual suggestions, but nothing too bad. This book is wonderful, and definatly worth getting."
1,Look elsewhere,"I got suckered in by the low price, but this tool would not be worth owning even if it was free. The back plate doesn't line up with the hole punches, which makes it more or less useless. Made in Taiwan piece of garbage."
1,behind the title,"The star is for the title, which remains the best thing about the book.From cornball to overblown hype, the information is far from savvy. This is a rip-off of previously published and more helpful guides."
5,Fabulous,since I enjoy old cars-watching this dvd was the best-I will purchase other dvd's in the near future-Thanks
2,ONE OF THE WORST,"ONE OF THE WORST disaster movies of all-time! 149 minutes of mostly crappy sap opera! the last 45 minutes is the only thing that saves this! The special effects are so bad U can actually see the toy model trains and choppers!The Killer Bees play 2nd string to the bad acting and pathetic script! Katherine Ross is the only bright spot in this awful excuse for a movie!The ALL-TIME Greatest action disaster director Irwin Allen (Poseidon Adv, Towering Inferno, Fire, Flood, and many other classics) is allowed one bad movie and this is it!The Swarm joins the list of the ALL-TIME TOP 10 FLOPS LEMON LICKER AWARDSalong with other duds :The Big Bus, Junior, Raising Arizona, Earthquake....."
5,The Swarm is Better than ever!!,The Swarm may be one of those disaster movies from the late 70's but it is by far my favorite in the Killer Bee movie genre. From the first time I saw this when I was a kid until now I love this movie. From the opening helicopter attack to the family picnic attack all the way through to the closing credits this one ranks high with me. My favorite part would have to be the burning of Houston and the building attack at the very end.I can hardly wait for the dvd to be released!
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible",How can an all star cast participate in such a bad movie??? What Slop? Henry Fonda is terrible! Caine is awful! Buy this movie for laughs!!!!
3,"Okay, but not worth the price","Tights are an essential in my wardrobe, but I am very picky about them in terms of sheerness. I hate having tights that are too sheer, but I also don't want a pair that is completely opaque. I got these in ""Le jet black"" and the sheerness was PERFECT.Quality-wise however, I don't think these are worth the price. They really aren't that soft at all... I have tights from Forever 21, Target, etc. that are much softer. I also already saw a few small holes starting after one night of wear (quick tip: coat those with a spot of clear nail polish to keep them from getting any bigger). The tights themselves are kind of odd... Instead of looking like thin socks that stretch over your legs, they are two thick, short, baggy things that fit as they lengthen over your legs. This doesn't affect the way they wear, I just never had tights with that shape before haha.Overall, there are better tights you can get for $10, but I do like the level of sheerness!"
3,Some Good Stuff if Your Patience is Strong Enough,As a student of change and one who writes and consults on the subject I found this pretty academic and full of theory. These folks get connected at the top of companies and then feedback to everyone what they observe from the mountaintop. What they dont seem to consider is whats happening along the way up - since they fly with the executives. There are a few scraps in here if you have time to find them. Average at best.
4,All that was advertised,"This item was everything that was advertised, though a bit snug in the midriff (and I am by no means a large man). Make sure you order a size larger than what you normally would, just to be on the safe side."
5,Great for Shell Dweller cichlids,"I bought these for my Shell Dweller cichlids and they love them. Have a nice wide opening which is great for the bigger Shellies too. Thanks, Eric"
1,Not what I ordered.,Not only did the company send the wrong product but they then said the error was not theirs and wanted me to pay to have it returned to them!!!! The product I received looks nothing like the one pictured. AMazon offers both issues. They advertised under the one you see above that I collect but sent an older one. UGH! I collect only certain editions of this author and am very careful to order only after seeing what the product looks like. Was very disappointed.
2,Cheesy Chick-Lit,"This book was very easy to read, predictable and soooo unrealistic and cheesy. Even at times of 'trauma' this book came across unbelievably upbeat and happy clappy.I carried on reading it as it wasn't awful to the point of throwing it against the wall. It would make perfect reading for a long journey or whilst sunbathing on holiday."
3,sour,this is not like the lemon pie filling you buy in the can. i actually thought it tasted a little on the sour side. will not be buying these again after we go through this case.
4,Pretty Nice,It looks gorgeous on me like I expected. The size is just right and the silver rings fall in place nicely and glowing vividly. I really like it. I have worn it more than I thought after I got it. My only tiny complaint is that the large silver lock in the back is a bit uncomfortable on my skin.
2,Thing change,"The author contends that the Harvard final clubs are an important part of the university's social life these days. Fity years ago, when I was there the Final Clubs were virtually unknown to all but a tine minority. They were an anachronistic curiosity. Could it be that things must have changed that radically ?"
5,Great Game,"THis game is so cool, you can ride around down town Chicago, smashing cars and doing lots of other damage, or you can drive safely and see all the things you can do on the streets of Chicago. MIdtown Madness is a great game and I recommend to anyone who likes fun games."
4,It's like Carmageddon 2 without the violence.,"It's a game which you could just keep coming back to just because it's fun. The graphics are excellent, and the AI is great. I think it would have been better though if Microsoft had included some more tracks. Other than that a wonderful game."
4,Just driving around without racing is pretty fun,"I've been playing this game for months, and despite the several different race modes I still like ""Cruise"" mode best. You can just wander around the city, cause accidents, and get chased around by cops. After a long day at work or classes, its great to start up the game, get the Freightliner, and go ramming through crowded intersections :) There are some very fun single-player cheat codes out there for it, worth looking up on the net after you've played for a while. The only thing that seems kind of annoying is how difficult it is to get the Panoz GTR-1. I broke down and hex-edited the save file to qualify for it. It was worth the effort ;-)"
4,Fun,"i think this game is really fun. There are alot of cars to choose from, and u can also download some from the internet. The only reason i gave it a 4 is because you only drive around 1 city. Midtown madness2 has 2 cities and they are much bigger and better."
4,A Very Good Game,"""Midtown Madness"" is a very good game. It's fun. Well, let me tell you - if there weren't a few drawbacks the game would have been a classic. The graphics are good. It is cool to see your car getting slowly turned into a piece of an old metal. However, everything looks a bit blocky. And the water is very badly made. Gameplay is cool, multiplayer is AWESOME (I love the 'Cops and Robbers' option). Overall, the game is good, but it could have been better."
3,Boring,I just bought this game 2 weeks ago and I'm already bored with it. If you are going to buy this game I sugest that you dont becaust MM2 is coming out and you should but MM2 instead!
3,OK IF YOU LIVE IN CHICAGO,"VERY NICE GRAPHICS. UNFORTUNAETLY IT FEELS LIKE YOUR TAKING A DRIVE AROUND THE BLOCK, THATS ALL. IF YOU LIVE IN CHICAGO OR KNOW IT, YOU'D PROBABLY LIKE IT A BIT MORE SINCE ITS WHERE YOUR DRIVING IN THE GAME. DOWNTOWN TO BE EXACT. NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS NEED FOR SPEED III, BUT CUTE."
3,"We come in peace, but we want to crash cars.","Midtown Madness will not be for all tastes. Anyone expecting a realistic driving sim will be disappointed. The car physics and dynamics are awful. They all handle like radio control cars. But you soon realise that racing to finish first is not the objective - all the other competitors are slow, think snail-like. When you learn that crashing into the other cars and generally trying to screw everybody else on the road up, is the true objective, you will have countless hours of fun and keep coming back for more. Think demolition derby on an accurately modelled and beautifully drawn city."
4,Drive like a maniac,"I've downloaded the trial version of MM and I certainly want the full version! I love being able to cruise around the city in whatever fashion (read: fast and reckless) as I see fit. You can't do this in real life; MM lets to pull of risky driving stunts like sidewalk passing, autobahn speeds on side streets, building crashing, cop racing, and bus slamming. Fun, fun for the agressive driver in all of us!Although some may complain about the steep PC requirements, MM runs without complaint on my P166/Voodoo2 setup, even at 800x600 with medium detail settings. Frame rates are pretty poor (of course), but the game is still playable. An Athlon system should be able to pull 1024x768 and high graphic settings without a problem."
4,Great game but missing something ........ like HALF THE CITY,"this game is great if you've gotten bored of driving in a circle all day. there are tuns of hidden places. i can spend hours just cruising around trying to get to places that seem impossible. HOWEVER, for those 3 million or so of us that live in Chicago, the game is almost insulting for its placement of buildings. They are missing about 60% of the city. I know that to include the whole thing would take a while and be tough, but they are missing roads and intersections that would make the game more fun, not to mention the miles of lower level streets by the river. Just by adding that would give you nearly 2 cities instead of just one.I applaud Microsoft for buying the idea off who ever came up with it, but they could have done a more thorough job before releasing it."
2,I hate to say this but....,"Well, what can I say. They had a great idea over at Microsoft. But, I think they rushed this game into the stores to fast.The concept is awesome...no tracks, just cruising the city streets. Go anywhere you want !But, the cars drive like, well, let's just say they're real bad. Such a limited selection too. Although, on an up note, they look really good. But, the AI (computer cars) are stupid.Congrats to MS for the idea. Rats for the outcome. For driving sims, look elsewhere...(like to Need for Speed 3/4)."
2,Disappointing on many levels,"First let me say this: the game will be wonderful fun for about 2 hours after that you may never play it again. Once youve crashed your car ever way, explored every near identical street, and won as many races as you have the tolerance for you may never play this game again. Not only does it have only 10 or so cars (compared to the hundreds of cars offered by other games) but they are modeled unrealistically and unconvincingly. As well as that the city of Chicago itself is modelled poorly especially considering they could have done it so well with the disc space alloted. Think of it as Chicago on a 1/4 scale, both in size and authenticity. The could have done so much with this game but it ended up as so little."
2,Fun! At first......,"When I had just bought this game , I loved it! But then , day by day , it got boring . i really don't suggest you buy this game"
5,Great from birth and up!,"My boss gave my daughter this book when she was born. It is about in tatters because of her and her younger brother's heavy use. When they're little they love the bright pictures and later they like pointing to things and words they know. It's a great tool for letter, word, shape, color, number, animal and etc recognition. I now give it as a baby gift to my friends and relatives."
4,Good Dictionary for a 5yr old,"I was after a dictionary for my 5yr old. I looked at lots but chose this one because it is in alphabetical order. My daughter often knows what the word should start with but just needs help on the spelling. Other children's picture dictionaries have the words in common groups i.e the face or in the garden, which might be nice to look at the pictures but for using it as a reference book to learn to spell this book works better for my daughter."
2,Ok if only to use as a book to read and not as a dictionary,This dictionary did not have any words that my son (when he was 5) wanted to look up. It was beautifully done and worked fine as a book to read. If it is just used to get your child used to the concept it is ok.
3,not for a six year old,"I purchased this dictionary for my six year old daughter. Upon opening the dictionary, i relized that my daughter already know all the words in it. Thus, going to purchase somethingelse. If you have a three or four year old, then this dictionary may be ok for you."
3,This book is for small children.,"1,000 words are no enough for my daughter.(5 years old) She is still asking me how to spell this one(not in this book.difficult one) I,m gonna find the another book have more words and picture."
5,My First Dictionary,this is a wonderful book for children i bought this book for my own 2 daughters when they were little and must have given it away over the years so when i saw it i had to buy it for my 2 yr old grandson the pictures are beautiful the book is a wonderful guide to help young children learn to read.
3,In Loving Memory -- 20 Nov 2009,"Sidney R. Bolick, the author of ""To Soar With The Eagles"", passed away this week. He will be laid to rest on 20 Nov 2009. I knew Sidney through my wife's friendship. He was a great guy who was very humble and nice. Interesting to talk to and he loved books and poetry.This book is a great story about his time in service in WW2. He lied about his age in order to get into the Royal Canadian Air Force. After 4 years of flying and teaching flying, he ended the war as a young 22-year old. It is hard for me to imagine going through what he did at that young age.Salute to a great airman and friend.Steve"
4,Good gift,I bought this for my niece. I read it and it was pretty good. She loved it. I also liked it. good start for someone getting into mangas.
5,Good edition of the Wealth of Nations - one of the few complete editions!,"I am not going to comment on the actual content of the Wealth of Nations, but instead on this particular edition of it. This edition by the University of Chicago Press is one of the few complete editions on the market today (and, its completeness shows, as it is quite hefty). It is essentially a facsimile of the 1904 edition by Edwin Cannan, with Cannan's original introduction. It also includes a new preface by the economist George J. Stigler. Both the preface and the introduction are fairly useful in laying out the main ideas that influenced Adam Smith in the writing of the Wealth of Nations. For its size and completeness, this edition is also quite cheap. It is perfect for anyone wishing to have the Wealth of Nations in its totality. Students (like me!) will also find it quite useful in their studies."
3,Maybe not necessary for you.,"This product would have been great if I had needed it. I saw that it was frequently purchased with the stereo wiring harness so I assumed that I needed it in order to correctly install my new stereo, but it is not necessary. I know I should have looked into it more myself, but it would have been easier if they included anything in the description of the product.So, to fill in that blank: only buy this if you need to install a single din pocket adjacent to a single din head in a double din slot. If your car has two pockets already, then you will not need this."
3,"Funny in places, just not all of them","I love Tim Wilson. The Tim Wilson that I found listening to the Bob and Tom show. That guy is hilarious and puts a unique spin on several concepts. That Tim Wilson is here during parts of this DVD. However, he isn't here for the whole thing. Some of the bits here are way to trite and overused by just about every wannabe during open mike night in every dive in America. Don't get me wrong, I still like Tim Wilson and would even probably spend money to go see him live. But, I wouldn't stay if this was the act hat he was doing."
5,"I laughed, I cried, I played it again!","Kevin's music is fun and makes you want to dance at the same time that it makes you really think and relate his thoughts to your own journey through life. He is the most exciting new artist I have heard in so long! I am enjoying the message of each song and look forward to his next c.d. My favorites are: ""Will you Follow?"" and ""Melting Time"" Barbara in Arizona"
3,"Not bad for what it is, but...","This isn't a bad pinball package at all, but it's definitely not the best available (for that, refer to the Pro Pinball series).The games are faithfully rendered on-screen, and look and sound just like the originals. The gameplay itself, on the other hand, can be a bit choppy in places compared to the Pro Pinball engine. Cue Ball Wizard, in particular, is very difficult to play -- the sharp angle at which you view the table doesn't help. (If only they'd allowed you to view the tables from different angles...)The earlier games provide a nifty sense of history for the pinball genre -- but are often not that much fun to play. The novelty may wear off relatively quickly for those used to today's tables.Well worth a look -- and...it's not a bad value just for the nostalgia factor. If you want a great game as well as a history lesson, however, look to the Pro Pinball games."
5,The Ultimate Pinball Game!,"Let's see... A real pinball table cost anywhere from [$$$$] to [$$$$]. So, I would say that you are getting your moneys worth with Microsoft Pinball Arcade wich has seven classic Gottlieb pinball machines.I have had this game for over a year now, and my family and I play it several times a week. I can honestly say that this game offers the best artwork, realistic sounds effects, ramps, multiball and traps of any other pinball game out on the market. There is a high score section for each of the seven tables, you can costomize your keyboard, joystick and game pad controls, and you can also control the volume of the background theme music or the tables sound effects.No, they are not real pinball machines... But Microsoft got as close as they could to the real thing. A must buy for anyone who enjoys pinball and wants a more realistic feel."
1,Save Your Money,"Honestly, the only real interesting game on it is ""Haunted House"", but it's hard to really enjoy it because the field of view is SO LOW! Also, the Ball is VERY Bouncy, making shooting VERY Difficult. It's really a shame because the game had So Much Potential... if only Microsoft had done it right, but they blew it. :("
1,Boring,Boring! Not worth the price of the CD it is on. Only a nostalgic pin-ball junkie might appreciate this.
1,Boring pinball game,"I am really surprised how boring this game is. The older pinball games are extremely boring. I played it once and it hasn't been played since. No one in my family liked this game and I would urge caution before buying this game. If you are looking for an exciting edge of your seat pinball game, I wouldn't recommend this one. I only wish I hadn't wasted my money, and that I could return it. Thank you."
4,Great games!,I love all the games but for some reason when i get a high score i can`t see them----like they`re all blacked out.
2,Not what you would expect or is it?,"The graphics for the game are amazing. If you like the old style pinball machines, you'll like it. You don't have a lot of flashing lights or bumpers, there is not much control. Frankly, if I wanted to play the old style machine, I would rather locate an arcade with these machines. With a plethora of pinball games out and most of them using more modern style games, I would recommend something more in tune with them. It is definately for the pinball fanatic, if they don't want to play on a real machine. Go figure."
1,Very disappointing!,"I was very surprised to to find that the pinball game that came with my computer is far better that this. Did not have ""the feel"" of real pinball. This is compared to the other game. I expect much, much more from Microsoft. I do not recommend it."
3,Great Graphics-- Not Much Fun,"This pin ball game has wonderful graphics and sounds, but it is missing an important piece: FUN! There is not much going on and not a lot to do. If you are looking for an addicting game that will entertain you for hours, this is not the game for you!"
4,5 outta 7 aint bad,"First off understand this, if you are looking for flash which most of the people who wrote negative reviews here were, skip this. However, if you want a really good trip into retro pinball land then this package is a sure winner and a great value. Lets face it, I can't go down to my corner drugstore and play Knockout or Slick Chick or any of the other oldies. What is wonderful about this package is I can sit home in my underwear in front of my PC and experience pinball the way 2 generations before me did. On my first few plays on Humpty Dumpty I was like, ""this is dumb"", the ball just drains, no flippers at the bottom. But spend some real time with this game and you see why Microsoft choose to include it in the package. My thoughts are that the 1st five games are totally retro and I enjoyed them immensely, however, the last 2, Haunted House and Cue Ball could of been left out and I wouldn't of cared, hence the 4 stars."
4,MS Pinball Arcade,"I agree with David Wolf about the animation and ball control. However,as one who was a leg-kicking, glass-pounding wizard wanna-be, I must say that all the little design quirks you loved to hate on the original machines are built into these also. I especially love to hate Slick Chick and Spirit Of '76. (That dates me). All in all, Arcade ain't bad but its a shame it isn't a lot better."
5,Just Like I Rembered It,"When I was a kid, my Dad bought my brother a slightly used pinball machine for us to play. Who would have known ""Humpty Dumpty"" would be a classic?Starting from age 6 through high school I logged literally thousands of hours playing Humpty Dumpty. So I would consider myself somewhat of an expert on the look and feel of playing that game.Microsoft nailed it right down to the sound of the buzzers and how the balls behave (including being able to sneak the ball backwards up one of the chutes just like the real thing). It is spooky.OK. Its annoying that I can't nudge the way I want to, I keep trying to push on my keyboard. Instead you nudge with keys. But I've been able to tilt the game pretty much the way I used to :-)For a real pinball wizards this might not be the real thing, but it sure feels close to me. And I have a lot of fun playing it."
2,Disappointed,"Although these pinball games can be a lot of fun, they lack the realism and feel of real play. I was looking for high performance pinball games similar to Microsoft's 3D Space Cadet."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"The box looks exciting, but the looks are decieving in my opinion. If you expect flashy arcade fun, pass this one by. The older games are no classics in my book, and if I had found a demo to download I would have NEVER bought this one. I expected more from Microsoft, but was left very dissatisfied. As an avid pinball player, I would have never feed quarters to these games. I had much more fun with others, this one was uninstalled after seeing it the first time."
4,Thunderhead,Most accurate fixed blade I have tried. Shoots within an inch of my field points at 30 yards. I am planning on using these for Elk and Whitetails.
1,Reformulated and repackaged,"Glytone used to be a great product line (silver jars). This is a ""new and improved"" product (white jars). It rolls off the skin and cracks it insted of smoothing it. I will be switching to another line."
2,"Good quantity, Bad quality","Lots of great songs, but some of them have this irritating electronic voice ""singing"" the lyrics which is really offputting, especially on ""My Way"" - couldn't work out how to switch it off on a regular DVD player. For $45, or even $36, I'd expect better quality."
5,artful literature,"The Archers Flight is an extra-ordinary book, a fast paced, thrilling, fantasy novel. Mark Keavney has come at a time when fantasy is stagnating, where all the books in the genre are so similar once you've read one you've read them all but Mark manages to breathe life into the genre with his amazingly orriginal ideas and characters.if you enjoy reading at all this book is a MUST HAVE no matter what genre you enjoy"
1,Wretched tape,"This tape is NOT gentle. The dispenser tear-off place is a joke. The tape is TOO stretchy and once it's on there, it HURTS to take it off. A total sadistic joke by the medical industry."
2,too much money and doesn't come with alot!,"I love SSC, but this is just a huge disapointment! for $29.99 no way is it worth the price! It hardly comes with ANYTHING and the quality is sooooo cheap! I am returning mine!!"
2,The Mosaic Idea Book,"After a few pages of ""How To"" basics, the remaining pages are mostly filled with small isolated images documented in clever ""artsy"" dialect. From the title: ""Ideas,"" I expected to see large completed conceptions where I could examine the total effect of a whole composition, especially how the color, shape and size of the border influenced the overall result of an end product."
