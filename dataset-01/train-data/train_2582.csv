4,extremely loud and incredibly close,"fascinating book, about child dealing with grief.child was very inteligent, very imaginative. he was notordinary in any way . . the book is not too short . it is a perfect length. the book is not for someone who is not imaginative, cannot believe how a child can deal with loss. the seach for an answer."
3,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,I saw the movie first and enjoyed it more. I found the book hard to follow. I did not like the flow of the book. It seem to jump around. There some pages that were written very small and i could not get the words bigger so i could not read.
1,A total waste of time,"This book is one of the worst I have read in years. It is just an endless collection of drivel. The entire story is confusing, boring, and a complete waste of time. I suffered until I reached the half way point and just gave up on it. Can't believe they would make a movie about this garbage."
3,"good story, poorly told.","The story of a young boy whose father died on 9/11. The child finds a mysterious key in his dad's belongings and is determined to find out what the key is for. The film combines his search for the lock with depictions of the boy's difficulty in dealing with the loss of his father. The boy is rather difficult for adults to deal with, and also difficult for the audience to watch. His acting-out is frustrating at times, and makes him more annoying than likeable. I found the movie a bit overlong, although the final minutes of the film are more rewarding than the middle. I would say that this film has a good story to tell, but I am not so sure this one tells it."
1,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,I thought this book was extremely strange and hard to follow. I actually did not finish the book which is unusual for me. Did not see the movie but can't image making a good movie from this book.
2,so far all it is doing for me is putting me to bed,I downloaded this book about a month ago. I think I have gotten through 3 chapters and I am bored. So bored it is putting me to sleep. I usually do not abandon books but I might have to with this one. I want to like it so I am going to give it a bit more time. I haven't seen the movie. The writing is a bit disjointed. I am going to see where this goes.
1,Like trying to have a conversation with ADD child,"I couldn't follow this book, subjects and timelines jumped around more than the Easter rabbit! I didn't like this style of writing and didn't finish the book (a rare occurrence)."
3,Forget expectations,"If you're considering this book expecting a ""fairy-tale"" depiction of New York, prepare to be disappointed. Furthermore, the people he meets play a surprisingly small role in the story and don't really contribute to the theme or resolution of the story. In fact, half the book is devoted to another story thread concerning a different character that rarely interacts or influence the ""key quest."" I admit that it is a bit unfair to penalize a book for its failure to match expectations, but the synopsis do lend itself to expect a New York rooted in child-like innocence rather than one more grounded in reality."
1,Needs formatting for kindle. Couldn't finish the book. Thoughts jumbled and can't follow,1. The formatting is way off on kindle version.2. Jumps around too much to follow.3. Some thoughts are just thrown together. It was too hard to follow.4. I don't see how someone thought this book was good enough to make a movie. I've read hundreds of books that would be better screenplay.5. Don't waste your time or money.
1,"Wow, I wish I had purchased something else",I was so excited to purchase and read this book. It was the most dissappointing book I ever suffered through. I can't even believe I read all of the book. Please don't waste precious time and money. I do hope the movie was better.
5,One of the best books ever written,"If you love Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club, then this book provides a similar magic. I could not put it down. I just ordered Everything's Illuminated, and I can't wait to read it. Foer is masterful. This writer is a genius and makes everything else published today read like utter garbage."
3,Take It or Leave It,"I read this book over the summer for school and I thought it was alright. Some parts were emotionally and very sad. A lot of people sad they cried while reading it but, I didn't find it that emotional. It's a quick, entertaining read. However, so parts are confusing and I had to re-read them completely to understand what was going on, especially with Oskar's grandparents. Also, some parts were very long, drawn out and boring. Overall, I would read it again, but not as a first choice."
3,Now I have to go read it!,"My book club is reading this for our meeting in two weeks and I just finished it in audible form. Wrong format! With the flip part of falling man and the other bits like blank pages and things written in red, I now see that I should have bought the book, and if I want to fully participate in the discussion I am going to have to go out and purchase the book anyway. I think the story is OK. I did not like Oskar's voice...he's just waaaay too precocious. I understand that his life was ruined by his father going to the WTC on 9/11 (the father doesn't typically go there..but on that day he did) and that Oskar thinks that his father left him a clue...but in the end the book disappoints and nothing is really resolved. And the grandparents stories distract rather than add to the overall plot."
3,"I thought this novel was ok, however it did not interest me that much.","This was the first 9/11 related book I have read. The main character is a nine year old boy named Oscar who finds a key in his dad's closet and want to find the lock it opens in order to learn more about his father. His father had a meeting in the world trade center the day of 9/11 and died because of it. I think Oscar is very mature for his age and meets a lot of strangers and walks around NYC by himself. He eventually finds what the lock belongs to. I just wasn't really into the book and was looking forward to a better ending, but it was an okay read."
2,Quirk Piled Upon Quirk,"I liked the idea for this book. The first few pages gave me hope I was reading something unique. I liked the multi-generation layers of letters and points of view. And then it sank. The let-down was slow. I tried to hang with Oskar, through all the implausibilities and his intersting questions and his letters to Stephen Hawking. I like quirky characters. I loved Owen Meany, as an example. The odd collection of people Oskar meets added seemed like Foer was piling on. The virtually blank pages made me feel manipulated. Another quirk. The odd photos were even more distracting, and annoying. More quirks. The writing, in spots, was dyanmite and sharp. In others, almost purposely blah and choppy. I recommend that potential readers sample from multiple parts of the book before trying -- trying -- to settle in."
4,Woven threads to tell the complete story,"This story tells the tale of Oskar Schell, a young boy dealing with the aftermath of his father's death on Sept. 11, 2001. After this tragedy, the boy's family (his mother and paternal grandmother) try to put their lives back together, while trying to do what's best for this incredible little boy.But this is not a straightforward tale. The author changes perspective on you, and the big picture is told through many points of view and from many different times and places.The story is also somewhat told through photographs taken by Oskar's camera, a gift that used to belong to his grandfather, who left his grandmother.In all, this was a moving story, with twists and turns that followed Oskar's search for his father."
1,extremely loud and incredibly close,the emperor has no clothes. terrible read. difficult to follow. shallow character development. waste of money and time.
1,Can't read on Kindle,"I truly enjoyed the story, but unfortunately, I bought it on the Kindle and there are parts of the book you can't read on the Kindle. I had to borrow a hard copy to finish the book."
1,hard to say...,"I'm torn --which of his books is the worst.??..its a real poser, a conundrum, an enigma, if you will (insert 3 blank pages here ) ....hmm I'm gonna have to go with this one...Everything is Illuminated is justthismuch better, what a sad sad world we live in when dreck like this gets praised."
1,Extremely loud & incredibly close,"I found this book very hard to read. It jumps around in time and I'm not always sure who is speaking. Could not get into it at all, hope the movie is 100% better!"
4,"""You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness.""","""So many people enter and leave your life! Hundreds of thousands of people! you have to keep the door open so they can come in! But it also means you have to let them go!""What a wonderful and touching book! Pick up a copy and go on a memorable journey with young Oskar, a boy on a quest for the lock that fits the key he believes his father left for him before he died at the World Trade Center on 9/11. The key unlocks so many unexpected things for Oskar and the people he encounters along the way.I read this book in 48 hours, and I have two young kids and a full-time job. Read it; you'll be glad you did."
1,Wish I Had Trusted My Instincts,I had a sneaking suspicion that this one would not be for me and I wish I had not ignored my intuition. I am about to quit this book...the characters are just too implausable and ridiculous. I agree with another critic who said that you will either love or hate it. I hate it.
1,"A Terrible Read, Absolute Blather","The story started out annoying and went rapidly downhill. Pure drivel. How ridiculous to use the names of real people and news events and call it fiction. After the struggling through sixty or seventy pages, just gave up. Will not bother to see the film. This story belongs in the trash."
1,Scattered,"I could not finish this book. I can't believe they have made it into a movie. I have no idea how that could be done. I found it ridiculous, in a post 9/11 world, a young boy would be turned loose to roam NYC, meeting total strangers. I found his switching out of the answering machine to be cruel and selfish. BUT! as a parent myself, the hardest thing for me to comprehend was the lack of adult supervision in this child's life. The story just did not line up...very frustrating read."
2,Exploitative,You can't just slap some weepy text up and call it profound. This is an exploitative book that isn't considerate toward victims. I object to the premise behind this book and the extreme execution (disaster porn at its worse) did not convince me otherwise.
3,Like the concept of the story line.......,"but didn't love the book. I found it extremly difficult to follow, found the characters not believable. Over half the book focused on the grandparents instead of the child and his mother. Oskar was suffering and I understand that, but I felt like I was following him through Magic Quest instead of how the loss of his father affected him."
2,Kindle version has major issues,"This is a review of the Kindle presentation of the book, not the book itself.There is one chapter which is presented in the form of a letter which has been marked up in pen by one of the characters. This chapter is presented as scanned full size pages. The font size on a Kindle 3 is minuscule, and the text is rendered in light grey rather than black. Due to these two issues, this important chapter is all but utterly illegible.The reading experience is truly unacceptable.I set the book aside and spent a week wondering about the fate of the protagonist before I finally forced myself to squint through the tiny grey text and on to the next chapter.There are numerous other minor formatting gaffs and hic-ups. These I don't mind, but they're surprising in such a popular book.All in all, I would suggest avoiding the Kindle version of this book. Read it on paper."
1,Can you give negative stars?,"This is probably one of THE WORST books I've ever read. It got such great reviews, so I kept reading in hopes that it would get better. It did not. And I was angry for wasting the time (not to mention $) on it. It never really made much sense due to the fact that it never had real separation from when the person speaking in conversations changed to another person. You never really knew who was saying what. Maybe that's the fault of the electronic version, but I didn't like that. I never felt much connection with the mother and the boy seemed forced. I was completely disappointed and probably won't read anything else by this author. There are too many better books out there to waste time with this."
4,"Touching, albeit sometimes a difficult read","Based on the reviews, I took a flyer on this book - and I am very glad I did so. Although at times the story is a little fractured and difficult to gain your bearings, in total, it is a beautiful and touching story. The characters are intriguing and unique. I enjoyed that the primary story is told through the eyes of an odd little nine year old boy struggling to come to terms with the tragic death of his father. Foer is particularly clever in his execution, using color, photographs and varying typesets to lend context to the characters. The closing series of photographs were of particular impact. As the book drew to an end, I found myself with tears in my eyes. It has been a long time since a book has touched me in such a way. I will admit not everyone will enjoy Extremely Loud, but if you tend to lean towards the non-conventional, you will be drawn into this book."
2,"TOO CLEVER, TOO PLEASED WITH ITSELF","Extremely erudite and incredibly clever, at first, then too clever for its own good. I loved it for 18 pages, then the meta-fictional elements started to turn me off. Oh, it is sooooo so sooooo clever. A brilliant 10-year-old who speaks French and turns everything into an intellectual game tries to deal with his grief. The series of pages with just a phrase on each one breaks the ""fourth-wall"" illusion that is necessary to fiction. The photo of the doorknob is so banal. Yes, this novel is clever, in a way, but it's so pleased with its own cleverness that it becomes boring and stupid. Sorry, Mr. Foer, wrong number. I lasted about 75 pages. It got to be a chore to read, not a pleasure, which is what fiction is all about. I'm not the right reader for this kind of book. You need a left-brain person who is tickled to be in on the joke. I get it, but I don't want it."
4,Imaginative!,"Very amusing. Quite similar to his wife's book, ""History of love"" but not as good. Parts of it got a wee bit boring. But loved the way he's played around with text, fonts and pages. It is very inspiring for amateur writers to read a book that imaginatively explores beyond plots, characters and sequence. I really want to read his ""Everything is Illuminated"" soon."
2,"Good concept, less-than-impressive writing","Though the story in general has a touching point behind it, this book became quite difficult to follow at certain points. There is a lot of jumping around, causing the reader to waste time trying to figure out what is going on, who is speaking, and so on. Occasionally, this would not be an issue, but it becomes highly annoying when it happens consistently through a book. Also, (and I realize it was most likely done for an authentic feel in some of the letters) the grammar was horrible. Run-ons drive me nuts. At times, I enjoyed this book, but more often than not, I just got very bored and annoyed. Not the book for me, but it may be more of someone else's style!"
3,Parental Caution,"I thought this would be a great book for my teen to read for a book report since it is about a young boy trying to find his way after losing his father. It is not. There is graphic sexual content told by the grandparents that was inappropriate for my child. I should have investigated better - my fault. Each parent has to decide what is best.I recommend for adults, but not for young teens."
1,"Too ""Jumpy""","This story just jumps back and forth too much, I only made it halfway through the book and gave up. There were times I lost track of which character I was reading about."
1,extremely loud and incredibly close,"extremely boring and nauseous. Only thing i have to say that the movie was worse. Great acting , horrible subject.Did not enjoy the story."
2,Extermely loud and Incredibly close,"I love to read, but I had to make myself finish this book. It was so disjointed, and abrupt, it seemed. Ending one chapter with Oskar, then the next, going back in time to his grandparents. I didn't like it at all."
2,Always finish,I really enjoy reading and rarely find a book that I cannot finish. This one was the exception. Did not enjoy it at all.
4,Book,"Arrival on time, was it great shape. Bought it for my daughter to read for her English project. The story is a amazing! If you haven't read it.....read it"
4,Interesting,I enjoyed the book but it took me a while to get into it. I really didn't like the perspective from the child at the beginning.
2,Dissapointed in the end,"I can't write a full explanation for scoring this a two without giving something way. But in the end, some of the wonder of the story is destroyed by a revelation ..."
2,Weird and annoying,"Frustrating to read on a Kindle due to illustrations and handwritten, marked up letters. Beyond that, I forced myself o finish it - weird writing style was quite off putting."
3,Too quirky for me,"When I was reading, I kept getting the feeling that the author was trying too hard to be quirky and unique. This was a big turn off for me, and I found it very hard to get through the book. I gave it three stars because I did absolutely LOVE the main character; I loved the way he narrated the story and his own little quirks (""heavy boots""). During the first few chapters, I couldn't put the book down because I fell in love with this little boy. But when the interjecting stories came in (the letters, the not speaking, etc), the book quickly lost me.Overall- a FANTASTIC main character, but a story that couldn't keep its grip on me."
2,Not my cup of tea!,"I really didn't care for the book. A very sad story about some very sad people. Most of the main characters, in my opinion, are mentally ill. Their illness is a result of horrendous events in their lives. I think it shows how mental illness can carry down through generations as well.I never got to a point in this book that I didn't want to put it down. That is my test of a good book. I read it for a book club, if not for that I probably would not have finished the book."
4,"Memorable, unforgettable","I was acquainted with Jonathan Foer's work after watching ""Everything Is Illuminated"". I won't try and top or add to the many thoughtful reviews here. It's an astounding and complex piece of creative writing and thinking. For my taste it dragged on with the grandfather's tales but everything, ultimately, had a place. At the very least it refocuses my attention on the 9-11 attacks and personalizes them as no news report could. It reminds me that we don't want to forget."
2,Not too good and easy to put down,"Typically, I prefer any book to the movie but not in this case. I had seen the movie as it was up for best picture at the Oscars (it did not deserve to be there)and I was even more disappointed in the book. I thought the story being told by a child would deeply involve me in the situation, but I found the writing to be disjointed and the pictures throughout to be mere filler for a book that did not get me to feel attached to the characters in any way...."
1,Great Expectations,I knew nothing about the book ahead of time so I didn't know what to expect. It was a strange book for me. Some of the chapters on the feelings of a particular character were difficult to follow. I had to wait for certain information within the chapter before knowing who was talking. The feelings are hard to hear and to deal with such loss is unfathomable to me. Sometimes I get to a certain place in other books and start liking it much better but that never happened for me with this one. Sorry!
4,Review,Very distinctive style. Nicely written but a little confusing at the beginning. The switch between Oscar and his grandfather's story is a bit abrupt.
2,Extremely sappy,"I had a difficult time making it through this book. It was a convoluted, torturous narrative with bizarre and unlikeable characters. Once I finally got to the end, I was rewarded for my labor by a ridiculously sappy ending. I would not recommend this book."
3,I don't know...,"I wanted to like this book...and it was okay, but I don't think I'll ever read it again.The bulk of the book was written from the point of view of 9-year-old Oskar, who's extremely precocious and has the vocabulary of a 20-year-old. But okay, I got past that, because Oskar's parts were fairly entertaining and easy to read. For the most part, he kept me interested.The rest of the book was written from several other points of view, and perhaps my mind is just not sophisticated enough to see how it all fits together, but I don't. The non-Oskar sections of the book were sometimes okay, but more often weird, hard to follow, and (in the case of the Kindle version) almost impossible to see at all.Summary - I finished it, I didn't have to force myself, I was fine with the ending (which is not to say I loved it). But...eh."
3,See the movie 1st,"Wow. There are 750 reviews on this book already!! I understand the few complaints I have seen about pace or being boring, but let me say this for anyone considering the audiobook who has NOT read the book before. I recently watched the movie version and my first thought was -- this would also work well as a book on tape, in a ""Curious Dog in the Nighttime"" kinda way. I am just beginning but the audiobook is voiced very well, very inline with the movie characters. The best thing for me listening to this now, is that the audio is filling in much more of the backstories left out of the movie (as all books do), which if there is TOO much detail, can be boring or upsetting. Knowing the book is based around the horrible, horrible tragedy of 9/11, but it also gives us hope through the eyes of a child trying to understand how to go on, forever changed. Well worth listening to, to remind us of all the little things that make us who we are together and apart."
2,Confusing,I found this book to be EXTREMELY confusing. I just couldn't follow it at all. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone.
3,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"I didn't see the movie, although I wanted to because of the actors. So, I was really looking forward to reading the book, but it was definitely disappointing. It is very strange and it takes a little while to get used to the way the author writes. By the time you finish reading it, the book makes sense. I am glad I read it, but it is not one that I would ever want to re-read. Hesitant to really recommend it to anyone."
2,Extremely Navel Gazing and Ridiculously Depressing,"The 9/11 tragedy, autism, manic depression, the Holocaust, the bombing of Germany, AND the nuking of Hiroshima. Wow! If Foer had added a deathbed scene with a cancer patient he would have effectively covered every single cheap ploy for getting tears from his audience.Foer has a talent with words (enough to get two stars), but, other than some much needed humor in the narration from the view of the young boy, this novel is a morose, tedious mess. What could have been, with a lot more restraint, focus, and maturity, a brooding meditation on loss, is instead a pity party for a bunch of navel gazing Debbie Downers."
2,Not a great kindle read,"This review is based only on the kindle edition of the book. There were several passages that absolutely could not be read on the kindle bc the font became too small. Even with the font maximized on the kindle, it was too tiny to read."
5,Brilliant,"That's probably the best book I read recently. Although I am not a huge 9/11 fan, this book really helped me to see the loss of a father from a child's point of view. As a person with a psyc degree, I can say that Foer captured the trauma experienced by a mature 9-years old so correctly. It reminded me that how a child loves parents unconditionally, and the way he builds his life around them. If one of them dies, all his life will be shattered and it's not easy to built a new one. I reminded me all the children whose fathers (and mothers) die in wars everyday. Oscar, such a precious child: pacifist, vegan, sensitive about the inequality that capitalism brings. Probably, that's who Foer really is. That's why I loved him, and his book very much."
5,"Extremely moving, incredibly touching","I found the first few pages rather hard going, but soldiered on. It became one of the most fascinating modern novels I've read---a post Sept. 11 story, likely to become a cult item"
3,"Lovely Book, Might Drag for Some","I've seen the movie Everything is Illuminated {also by Foer} and really liked it, so I was excited to try this book out. Just having read Room, I was skeptical of Foer's ability to capture the voice of a quirky kid. Oskar tends to have wandering thoughts and does go off on some tangets throughout the story, but believably. He doesn't seem as ""precious"" or contrived as Jack in Room. The story does jump around from Oskar's perspective to his grandma to his grandpa, but I think if you pay close attention, all the jumping around does pay off. I wish we go to know a little bit more about what the key goes to though. The ending is a little anticlimactic!"
2,Patchy,Disjointed and unnecessarily complicated. The characters were annoying and I just wanted them to communicate! A few convrsations could have solved many of their problems. It was also difficult to read on a kindle because the photos popped up in a patchy manner. The hand written letters could not be enlarged on the kindle screen making them difficult to view. Entirely unsatisfying.
2,OK read,"I read this book for my bookclub. I have to say it was not a favorite among us. Out of 8 women only one really liked it. I thought it did exploit 9/11 a bit since I don't believe I would have continued reading it if not for the sympathy I felt for the boy losing his father to that specific event. A very different writer but I felt tried too hard to be different that it was slightly annoying. Did not enjoy it that much...read ""Water for Elephants"" instead!"
5,Endless questions and some answers for Oskar Schell,ELIC was one of those books that I picked up and put down a zillion times on my Amazon.com visits. I finally picked it up from my local library. I will pass on the plot of this unusual and haunting book; some reviewers find Oskar's precociousness contrived. Anyone who has spent time with kids can easily find themselves on the ground with him looking for that four leaf clover...and follow his quest for the lock that matches the key. Why can't life be like it was before that Day? Why did my Dad have to die? Why do we make love? Why anything?
1,A Waste Of Time,"What a waste of time to read. The story is pointless, if it didn't have anything to do with 9/11 there wouldn't be single person talking about this book and a movie would have never been made. The story goes nowhere, it ends with nothing resolved. The characters are all depressing and quirky for quirkiness's sake. The only thing good I can say about it was at least it was short."
2,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"I did not finish this novel because the language was obnoxious to me. I don't speak that way, so why should I read it?"
1,Disappointing,"I can't imagine how hard it is to write a book about the aftermath of 9/11. And then weave it with the horrors of WWII. But I didn't like ANYBODY. Oskar's quirks were unnecessary and distracting. HIs grandfather was poorly developed beyond his inability (refusal?) to talk and his obsession with Anna. The premise was for Oskar's mission was... unnecessary? It was an ambitious attempt to confront how lives were torn apart by the terrorist attacks in NYC, but the lack of focus (pick one, Oskar or his grandfather!) caused the story to fall apart and tumble into an ending with no resolution despite the successful end of Oskar's quest. The feeble connection Oskar re-forges with his mother (oh, she knew all along that he was traipsing all across New York City! Well thank goodness!) seems forced and false. Perhaps the right author to tell the story of this tragedy has not come along yet. This one falls short."
2,Just not interested.,"Didn't read the whole book. I was waiting for the plot to thicken, but it never did. Maybe I should have read the whole book."
3,"Save a tree, please","The excellent writing and inventive story line of this novel are marred to some extent by the senseless gimmicks of the printed product.As someone who believes strongly in conservation, I was horrified by the many pages which were left blank or underpopulated by text. Safran Foer should feel confident enough in his story-telling that he should refrain from adding cheap performance art to his wonderful literary creation."
2,Uneven....,"Touching in parts, but I thought only character that was close to being well done was the little boy/protagonist; others were too sketchy or incomplete, although author tried but just didn't get there. You knew people were in pain, but it was like you could only observe them through a window, not reach out and touch them...Perhaps not my cup of tea. Any 9/11 novel deserves a better effort than this..."
5,Awesome Book,"Recommended to me earlier this summer, when I started reading this book I couldn't stop. It's an unorthodox narrative, actually meta-narrative, that utilizes non-traditional methods to develop the characters and conflicts. Oskar, the main character, is an interesting boy who embarks on a wonderful quest to discover answers to questions about his father's death in the World Trade Center on 9/11. Great book, highly recommended."
3,Hard to believe it's fiction.,"9 year old Oskar struggles almost every moment with the loss of his father on 9/11. That's what this book boils down to. Beyond keys, grandparents, and the other plots in this book...we're reading about a little boy who had to grow up very fast. I loved reading about Oskar. His thoughts, feelings and how he went about trying to survive his heartbreak. The other parts of the book I could've done without."
2,hard to get into,I felt this book was very difficult to get into! I read it for quite a while and just had to keep going back because it was a bit confusing. I would no recommend this
1,must have made a better movie,"I really thought I would enjoy this book. However, it must have made a better movie. I did not see the movie as I would generally rather read but I found the book to be.. for lack of a better way to say it.. Hard to read. It seemed like just rambling to me from the very start. Keeping up with the conversation which seemed at times to include others but yet not really ??? .. to be like a family holiday gathering.Not much point but a lot of talk.Anyway, I personally did not enjoy it and could not get myself to get even halfway into the book. Perhaps the best was yet to come and I just didn't get to the good stuff.Just my opinion."
5,Extremely Awesome and Incredibly Amazing,"This book is told from three different view points, Oskar, his paternal grandparents. It's full of twists and turns, and the author makes it so easy to relate the Oskar. Your heart truly goes out to this small boy. The ending will leave you suprised, and wishing that the book had been longer. The characters are odd, but in an everyday way, but in a way that the reader can relate with. This is a great book for anyone and everyone who's looking for a good read."
4,issues with reading on kindle,"I'm actually only just about half way through, but thoroughly enjoying this book except for one thing that I have just come across. Let me back up first by saying that at least part of why I chose to purchase a Kindle is because my eyesight is not that great and so I take full advantage being able to size the text according to my needs. (And I usually have it set on the third largest font setting). That being said, I have just come to a part of the book where I guess in the actual hard copy it is printed as if it is an actual copy of a letter from the dad...but this has made the type to be absolutely miniscule, and beyond my ability to read... I tried to resize but to no avail. Not having a magnifier handy anywhere I am stuck waitiing until I can get out somewhere to purchase one I guess... This is terribly frustrating."
4,Foer is an extremely good and incredibly gifted writer!,"Admittedly, it was the title and flashy cover of this book that drew me to give it a gander--SO glad that I did. This was such an incredible and inventive book from a promising young author. His creativity is refreshing and is consistently infused throughout this book. We have all been touched by the events of 911, and this book helps us immensely in our ongoing grieving and reconciliation process. Foer gives us the precocious young Oskar (who is on a mission through the boroughs of New York to find the lock that fits a key he found in his now deceased father's closet) and a cast of no less colorful supporting characters. An abundance of humorous and tender moments and chronicles of each person's journey to healing, this book cannot be missed!"
3,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"I found the author of this book difficult to follow. He was all over the place. I know its a popolar movie and book, I just had a hard time with the boy ""main character"" and his activities and thoughts."
1,Bummer - so contrived,"The four-star aggregate rating sold me, as did the description. Since I have only abandoned two books in my life, I slogged through it. Through the random pictures, endlessly repeated. Through the ridiculous grandma/grandpa narrative nonsense. Through the impossible-to-read-on-Kindle typographical contrivances (they're pictures of text, non-zoomable, and are too tiny to read... proving just how much value they actually add to the story). Oskar is a heartbreaking and delightfully quirky character who didn't need so many cheap tricks. I ended up wishing his story had been told by someone else."
3,A mixed review,"I liked the main character, and he was presented in a very sympathetic manner. I wanted to see more character development of his mother, who was hardly present. The flash-backs were interesting in a way, but it seemed that the author were maybe drawing an analogy between the bombing of Dresden in WWII and the events of 9/11/2001. I don't think the 2 situations are at all analogous, but maybe I missed the point, or maybe she was not trying to say that anyway. I was disappointed in the end and felt like the plot sort of trailed off and stopped somewhere rather than leading to a meaningful conclusion. It seemed to be an idea that could have been developed more effectively."
4,"Quick ending, but overall a good read","I wanted to read this because I saw a movie was coming out about this book. I liked that it had to do with September 11th, mainly because my bf was in Afghanistan at the time I read this. The main character is a young boy, who is brave and an exciting character. You want to keep reading to go on the journey with him. I thought the ending seem a little rushed, but overall I was very pleased with the book. It is a page turner and you will be wanting to see how it turns out. I just wish more time would have been given for the ending."
2,Extreme Loud,"I was very disappointed with the book. The writing hinted at a grand ending with a nice twist and it failed to deliver. I thought the boy's character was very unrealistic for his age. For the boy to be running around NYC with complete strangers just didn't make sense, where was the child's mom?"
3,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,Good book but at times a bit confusing. Doesn't explain the characters as well as it could. I was lost at times as to who was who.
5,love this book,"I love this book. I've read it three times and have given it to many friends. I've also listened to it on audio and gleaned even more of the connections that way. I'm using it as a book club book. A few people I've recommended it to have not liked it as well as I have, but most of my friends have loved it."
1,Incredibly Annoying,"It was unbelievable that a nine year old boy could have the vocabulary that the author spews out. I was not happy with this book. My English teacher would have given this book an F. I did not like this book. I wish I could have liked it, I really tried to like it, but no dice."
2,another stupid review,this book was delivered wirelessly to my kindle it came through jus fine however the content of the book was disturbing and Idid not like it
2,Extremely annoying and incredibly twee,"This read to me like a writing course exercise. Take a grab-bag of whimsical behaviours, scatter them across the cast, put it in an emotional setting and wait for the royalties to flow. The characters manage to be cliches, even with their oh-so-endearing idiosyncracies and it all struck me as a very cynical and disappointing exercise."
2,Doesn't work for me,"I thought I would read this book after hearing about the movie but it just is too confusing. All the jumping around in time doesn't seem to have a purpose. The boy isn't a convincing narrator.The language he uses and his thought processes are not those of a child his age. Roaming around New York seems like a very unrealistic thing for a child to do.Only when the book focuses on 9-11 does it seem ""real"". I don't think a child would have hidden the answering machine the way Oschar did. Most of the book is just not believable. The reviews seem overly positive. I find myself skipping sections to move the story along. Not sure I'll even finish the book.The pictures linked to the book do not come across well in the Kindle version.Very disappointing overall. Just too unbelievable."
5,extremely incredible.,This book changed my life. I couldn't put it down. It's unique and well-written and extraordinary.
3,1/3 of it is great,"Oskar Schell is a precocious 9-year-old who is struggling to come to terms with the death of his father in the World Trade Center on 9/11 and the wrenching secret about what he did on that day. Author Jonathan Safran Foer has created a remarkable character with a distinctive voice. Oskar is a sad kid with a lively mind, and through him, Foer makes us laugh even while he is tugging at our heartstrings.The novel's downfall comes in the parallel story of Oskar's grandparents, who also faced a catastrophic attack, the burning of Dresden during WWII. This section is full of clunky symbolism and my heart sank whenever they picked up the narrative. It was Oskar who kept me engaged until the end."
4,Oldies,"I like music from the 50s and early 60s, before the Beatles ruined everything and this album fits that area fine."
3,It seems all too possible,"Margaret Truman's Capital Crimes mysteries are always fun to read. With this one it is amazing how many current issues she squeezes into the plot: campaign spending, relations with Mexico, corrupt police and politicians, drug traffic and other crime, and even a vice-president friend who does not have firm footing. Mac and Annabel Smith do their stuff again. A good read. You care about the characters and are kept guessing until almost the end. Not her best, but very good."
1,Disappointed,"I've read a few of the Margaret Truman mystery series, and was disappointed in this book. Too many characters; almost wishing to continue to add characters to throw the reader off-balance for the real killer. Very interesting history of Watergate complex and the politics with Mexico, but I ended up skimming to the end of the book. My favorite was Murder at the Library of Congress..more intrigue."
3,An interesting read,"I love mysteries. I love suspense as well. And this book didn't fail in that respect. However, I am spoiled, I like really good writing when I am reading a mystery ~~ this book doesn't qualify.Mac Smith is appointed by the Vice-President Angrile to go to Mexico to oversee the elections there. There have been a series of murders lately ~~ and it all points to the ruling class in Mexico ~~ as they fought to keep the political powers in their grasp. Stories and rumors fly about in Washington and Mac Smith is right in the middle of it. His wife joins him on the trip to Mexico and they're in the midst of all the excitement.It is a fast read ~~ an interesting one. But if you're looking for a book with some substance to it ~~ this book would not be it. It is just a fast mystery read that you don't have to think about the characters much. It's a perfect read for a lying-in on a blanket while enjoying the fall colors.9-22-03"
3,Makes U.S. Mexican Policy first priority,All of M. Truman's books are entertaining. However this one doesn't live up to expectations. The main theme seems to editorialize about her opinions concerning U.S. policies re' Mexico. The mystery plot is late arriving and almost incidental.Hope the next one returns to her former standard.
3,"Truman still in form, and still fun to read","While Murder at the Watergate will not be listed at the top of Margaret Truman's Capitol Crimes mysteries, it won't be anywhere near the bottom. Since Ms. Truman found her characters, Mac Smith and Annabel Reed, her mysteries have become more fun, her comments and asides about Washington DC more spirited and pointed and her writing breezier. While not every plot is a winner--the murders at the National Gallery, the National Cathedral and the Kennedy Center were hits, while the Potomac, the Pentagon and particularly the FBI were misses, each new entry in the series is eagerly anticipated. Keep the mysteries coming, along with the barbs, the insider references and the pointed comments. Each one makes for an easy and pleasant summer read."
4,Good summer reading--Truman weaves more intrigue,"Delightfully fun to read. Anabel and Mac are once again at their best. Do we know people like Chris, Straight Arrow and Elfie? Maybe we do! Keep the mysteries coming..."
1,"very simplistic writing ,too long a wait for the murder","Some of the descriptions such as""she formed her lips to make a kiss and made a smacking sound! were very child-like"". The plot took too long to develop and almost no character development took place. Not having read any other of Ms. Truman's books, this one leaves me with no desire to do so. Her descriptions of The Watergate Complex were detailed and descriptive, but that's the most I can say about it"
1,Weak main frame leads to big problems,THe main frame is a flexible plastic which does not help keep the rear in alignment at 90 degrees. One hit to the tail rotor blades and the main frame will snap in two. The gyro was not pre set from the factory another problem with this product. I paid the extra money and purcased a quality helicopter with an aluminum frame that had been test flown before it was boxed to ship out to the dealers.
2,Look Elsewhere,"I have owned this helicopter for two months and have just crashed it breaking a part. The helicopter is extremely hard to fly. It is very unstable. It has a mind of its own. Forget about flying it indoors. It won't last if you do that. I always flew mine in a large grass field in low (1 - 3 MPH) or no wind conditions. No matter how hard I tried to be careful, I smacked it in numerous times. Just one of these crashes on concrete or asphalt would have ruined the helicopter. Since you can't really control it for more than 30 seconds, I recommend dead calm conditions for all flights. This is my first RC helicopter. I hope I can find another one that actually gives full control to the user. I don't recommend buying this helicopter."
4,Pretty neat,"Unlike the previous reviewers I have had no such problems with breakage. I have, however come close to landing the machine on the roof of my house. Caution must be taken to ensure that the air is dead calm when flying this machine. ANY wind will cause a problem. Also, it does take a fair amount of practice to master the controls. It is a good 1st step but definetly not for young children. I've had to duck more than once when flying it. I have always made certain to land it on grass and have had many landings without damage."
3,Pretty neat. A little hard to control.,"My husband really likes the heli. Though I must say a piece did break off with in a day of getting it. So it is a little too fragile for my taste. It is fun to watch the dogs run around barking at it. Only other issue I have is that no matter what adjustments you make, it always spins. The instructions say you can adjust to straighten it out. Spins in one directions no matter the setting."
2,basic,For what it's worth since I'm new to RC helicopters I hope there is something better out there!
5,Awesome helicopter,"Its a really good helicopter, really powerful. For $20, its a real value for money. It needs open space to tap the real potential of thechopper. I can fly indoors by keeping the direction always tothe right and chopper flies in a circle without taking too mucharea. Its a fun chopper !"
2,UNSTABLE,"This device is unstable. The 'copter spins clockwise without touching the tail-rotor control. The manual instructs that a 'trimmer' potentiometer can be adjusted to correct spinning. Even with the trimmer pegged the thing spins like a top. I tried using the rotor control too; holding it counter-clockwise, to no avail. Now, I am looking to find a decent RC chopper that will simply hover when the main rotor is powered up. If anyone has any suggestions on either fixing this one or a different model, feel free to post!"
3,Avoid Hobbytron,Hobbytron is terrible. The helicopter is not as easy to fly as the ad states but it is alright. The helicopter works but that's not the problem. Hobbytron is just plain rotten to deal with. I've purchased three items in the last two months from them including one of these copters and all of the items showed up broken. I fixed two of them. This one was easy but I sent a $169.00 heli back that was defective from the factory and now I am stuck with a store credit. Run from Hobbytron and don't look back.
1,dissapointed,"greapt chopper, other than 5 mins outta the box the roters broke, i reccomend getting at least 10 extra sets"
5,LOVE IT!,"I love how the different trails are rated... children ok, adults, horses, 4 wheel drive,etc. So far it's been accurate and fun! Excellent idea for day trippers!"
5,Precioso,Es un sueño hecho realidad. Ricardo Montaner con una orquesta! Su bella voz y su orquestación valen la pena. La escogencia de las canciones es excelente. Me encantó!
3,"Needs to be completely overhauled, a good buy nevertheless.","One gets the feeling when reading this book that any revisions to a particular chapter were tacked on rather than the whole chapter rewritten. The diagrams contained in the book have a definite amateur feel to them and would be better suited explicitly labelled. Nevertheless, the book fairly accomplishes its aim of teaching you how to bulid a ""Multimedia PC"" from scratch or upgrading from an old 286"
3,Bird Songs,"This can work if you are trying to find out what bird is making what call. However, you have to have an idea of what the bird is you are trying to identify. If not, you just have to go through all the songs and listen until you find what you want.Would have been better if categorized by the bird name, not the area you might find them in."
1,Questions and Answers,"The reason that this book has not come out yet and may never come out is because it was published by iBooks. iBooks filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy earlier this year after the death of Byron Priess, the owner and driving force behind the company. Don't hold your breath waiting for this book, you may just turn blue. I hope the author can find another publisher or what is left of the iBooks company will allow this book to be released by another company. Who knows?"
1,Vampire Beach,How can you review a book when you can't even find it for OVER a year. I have been waiting for this book since it was suppose to come out last summer(2005). WHERE IS THIS BOOK? Their is a lot of vampire fans out there that are asking the same question.
5,A Comedy to Delight All Ages,"If you are looking for a film to help a pre-teen begin his (or her) adventure in sub-titled films, may I recommend this sweet comedy. An old Polish soldier is barred from entering heaven until he can pass his military sword down to his grandson. A complication...his son isn't even married! (That son, by the way, seems more interested in cross-breeding fruits, then girls.) I delighted in the satire of the scene at the gate of heaven...it's pure genius.Several factors make this a wonderful film. First, the friendship of thesoldier with three of his comrades is a joy to behold. Second, the film introduces us to some lovely folk music of Poland. Third, the scene of village life in Poland recreates an idyllic pastoral setting. And fourth, I really liked the ending. (No, I'm not telling). Enjoy."
3,no complaints,"There is very little flavor, let alone fennel, but it certainly doesn't taste bad, like many toothpastes. I haven't had any bad effects, like the Dr Collins Restore that I had to stop using.I did receive a 6.25 oz, not the 7 oz advertised (I don't know if Desert Essence even carries a 7 oz) but that is inconsequential."
4,I thought the taste would be hard to handle...,"I'd used melaleuca toothpaste years ago while spending the summer with a friend and her family and was beyond amazed at how white and clean feeling it got our teeth, but it tasted awful! Fast forward 20 years and while considering a professional whitening, I remembered Melaleuca! I found this product and ordered it right away. While sharing my excitement for it's arrival, I warned everyone of the flavor and assured them the results were worth it. I can't tell you how pleased I am with the pleasant flavor and fantastic performance of Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil Toothpaste. Well, maybe I can...this will be a stocking stuffer for friends and family this coming Christmas. (grin) I'm completely serious."
3,Great for natural source of toothpaste,If you are into natural health this is great. Although I know quite a bit about herbal products this wouldn't be my first choice for toothpaste due to taste and lack of felling clean afterwards. I use an electric toothbrush and they still felt gritty using this product.
5,Wish I could purchase this in the local stores,"I'm pleased with the Dessert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil Toothpaste. I wish that I did not have to purchase it online. I tried this product with blind faith and I was prepared to ditch it in the trash can. This has a very good taste, its mellow and no lingering after taste."
2,yellow smile,well it freshens your breath but it doesnt keep your teeth white. mine turned yellow in a matter of a week.
2,Product lacks,"I have long been a proponent of using tea tree oil for it's natural medicinal properties. I sold Melaleuca for a while, but I had too much inventory and not enough money.I decided to use Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil Toothpaste. It was a bad decision. There isn't any flouride in the toothpaste and the taste is more bitter than using tea tree oil directly. More importantly, I haven't experienced any canker sores or dental issues over the past 5 years. I use this toothpaste for two months and I'm in the emergency room for a massive toothache.My recommendation: Don't buy. I'm going to pay a LOT more and order from Melaleuca. That stinks but I'll end up paying the dentist more money than I would ever pay for toothpaste."
5,Natural & Delicious,"This is my absolute, all-time favorite toothpaste. Not only is it natural and good for you, but it leaves a wonderful taste of fennel in your mouth. I can't seem to find this flavor in the stores in my area. A little pricier than other name brands, but it is so worth it. Other toothpaste brands make me gag when I first wake up, but I look forward to this one. I usually buy several at a time to reduce shipping costs."
5,Our new favorite toothpaste,"We still use Tom's spearmint and our daughter uses Tom's Silly Strawberry, but this is our new favorite toothpaste. It has a great wintergreen flavor. It cleans really well and leaves a clean feeling for a long while. I'm not sure what neem tastes like (if anything), but I do have tea tree soap and toothpicks so I know it, but this tastes pretty much just like a crisp wintergreen. Very refreshing."
5,Engaging ...,"Like telephone poles along a back country road on a Sunday drive, the pages of this book slip effortlessly by .... and you quickly find yourself anticipating what lies beyond the next hill or around the next curve of the story. We're lucky to be along for the ride as the author takes us on the journey of his life.Mr. Basnar creates vivid word pictures that blend into flowing murals for our mind's eye to watch. Each page is fast moving, full of texture and adventure and fun. This book is so engaging that in the end we, too, wish the story could go on and on.If you buy this book, prepare to be intrigued - and delighted."
2,more like a childrens book,only has 1 or 2 sentences on each page. took me 3 minutes to read he entire book. not worth the money.
5,Get a gift ... give a gift,I received this as a gift along time ago and thought it was great. So much so that now I give it as a gift to anyone I know who loses someone special. It can never replace that person or fill the void left behind but it can help us keep the memories alive.
2,"Juvenile book, not for adults!","I purchased for my husband who just lost both parents in the last three months. Inside book cover says, Juvenile Fiction/Picture Book. I did not see that mentioned in Amazon's description of product . I would not purchase this book for adults, definitely for kids!"
4,Memory book,This is a very beautiful book and worked well as a gift for what I intended. It was set up for a child to be able to read and follow along but the message works for adults as well.
5,For those who weep.,For anyone who has lost a loved one this book will be a lasting treasure to help with the grief. It brings help for the sorrowful heart and reassurance for the tearful soul.
3,They are at it again,"If you liked the Lost Skeleton, you'll like this - but it does have a very different feel. It pulls from many old movies (old Vincent Price and His Girl Friday), but well worth it. The end crazy-lady scene is priceless."
5,Dark And Stormy Night ~ A Swell Picture!,"The greatest thing about Larry Blamire's films is that they have an infinite shelf life. Each is packed with SO many subtleties, such great actors, and SO many strokes of inspired brilliance that I simply cannot bear the thought of never seeing them again. My profound thanks to Larry for not only thinking them up, but for bringing his ideas to life. Seriously, life is a lot funnier with DARK AND STORMY NIGHT on my DVD shelf."
3,It's OK,"This is probably my second favorite movie from this ensemble, with ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" being my favorite. This movie is also much better than the ""Lost Skeleton"" sequel, which I didn't care for at all. Overall, the movie is watchable and made me smile a couple times. There were a couple parts that seem really too silly in tone compared to the rest of the movie, but I thought the cast did a good job."
5,A most brilliant send-up,"Having laughed ourselves silly at The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavera dozens of times now, the anticipation for more of Larry Blamire's genius has been running high in our household. This one does NOT disappoint. What Blamire & crew did with 50's lo-fi monster movies meets its match with this treatment of the ""murderer in the big scary house in a storm"" genre. We were floored seeing this brilliant ensemble cast come back and take such a different turn with this wickedly funny treatment, nailing/butchering every accent and leaving no hoary chestnut unturned. This is one movie that will live in the player as much as it's in the case. Extremely recommended."
2,More like 5 yawns for the average movie-watcher,"For the average movie-watcher, this is more like 5 yawns and I'm disappointed that the average rating on this flick is so skewed to 5 stars. Even for low-budget movies, this is poor. I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it and I stopped it after viewing 20 minutes and not getting one opportunity to crack a smile, much less a chuckle. If you want to see a real send-up of old-style murder mysteries, then see ""Murder By Death"" or even ""Clue"".The concept seems good going in, but the script and timing are poor. The dialog and delivery could not make me laugh. Yes, I recognized some of the cast from TV-land, but there's a reason these people aren't regulars on hit shows."
4,Spooooky dark house... EEEEEKKKK,"I'm a big Larry Blamire fan and ordered this as soon as it was available. My kids and I waited with bated breath until it came. Then we watched and laughed and mocked this genre of film that was so popular back in the 1930. All the characters that you love in old dark house movies are portrayed, and brilliantly by Larry's cast from The Lost Skeleton series.The only point I have against this film, and my kids agree with me, is that one of the characters really ""pushes the envelope"" if you will, past the point of acceptable ridiculousness. Larry and the producers have always struggled with where the line is when making fun of a genre film. I'd say they got it 97%. The 4 stars are because I can't give 4.5 stars.For those of you that haven't' seen them.... watch The Lost Skeleton of Cadavera and The Lost Skeleton Returns Again. Both brilliant and wonderfully funny, also by Larry Blamire and company."
5,New teeth for a venerable old genre...,"Splendid haunted house murder mystery spoof, featuring a talented cast and some extremely witty dialog and situations concocted by writer-director Larry Blamire. If mystery send-ups, film-noir spoofs or quirky-character cleverness push the right buttons for you, add DARK AND STORMY NIGHT to your future-viewing queue. Very nicely done."
3,Dark and Stormy Night,Very funny take on the murder mystery genre with homages to the films they are parodying. Can't wait to see what they do next.
4,Great homage to classic spook movies.,"If you enjoy the old dark house movies, or even the comedy versions, like Ghostbreakers or Haunted Honeymoon, this is right up your alley. it takes the atmosphere, over the top acting and snappy dialogue of the thirties movies and turns it on its ear. You get sucked in by the silly exchanges between nervous ""guests"" at a will reading. then thing get really wacky. I took me a second viewing to appreciate this gem, but most of my favorite films, I didnt care for on first viewing. If you're a fan of spooky movies or madcap comedy, give this one a shot!"
5,"Dark and Stormy Night, Lots of laughs!","This one is easy to review, in a word, funny. I read reviews, and saw the one that said either you get it or you don't, and I definitely get it! Filled with fun characters set in a dark old mansion. The laughs are abundant when listening to the dialogue of funny lines poking more fun at the genre. Chock full of respectable smart remarks, and lines like, ""I said no, are you deaf?"", to the hooded killer make this film fun to watch. It's not a question of if it is a good watch, it is more like when. So if you are in the mood for something simple and very funny, this one easily fits the bill. Five stars!"
1,Didn't live up to expectations,"This product was highlighted in Oprah Magazine, which is why I bought it. The highlighter did not go on smoothly under the eye and was too shiny. I was very disappointed and will not use it."
2,Unhappy,I got this product was so excited to use it however I have to agree with some of the other reviews with my experience The end is like a dagger and I cant get anything to come out of the sponge end so what did I resort to white shadow of all things. considering all the hoopla about this product it wasnt worth 25.00
4,"Good for dampening noise, but won't block it completely","I bought these for use in a small computer server room. They effectively dampen most frequencies, but don't completely block out the noise. You can hear human voices very clearly when using these, which may or may not be desirable, depending on your situation. They are very lightweight and seem reasonably comfortable, although I haven't worn them for longer than 30 minutes at a time."
1,Uncomfortable!,"I found these hearing protectors to be uncomfortable, even for short term use. I would put the manufacturer's claim that they ""make all day use a breeze"" in the category of blowing wind.I returned this item and purchased two others in their stead. Comparing apples to apples, the Pro Ears Ultra 26 provides a comparable level of noise attenuation and is more comfortable. Comparing apples to oranges, the Pro Ears Ultra 33 is much more comfortable than the Pro Ears Ultra 26 - even though it is slightly heavier, its superior construction actually makes it feel lighter - and provides a much higher level of noise attenuation."
4,Great NRR and Comfortable,"Taken these to the range a few times now and I really like them. They are comfortable and were priced very reasonably.I've been at the range a few times with guys firing off 5.56 rounds and 12 gauge slugs in very close proximity to me and had no issues with sound. They were more than adequate for both situations.They are a little bulky but I knew that going into the purchase, I don't do much rifle shooting so they don't get in the way. However, I have fired an M4 with them on and they were definitely in the way. If you plan on shooting a rifle I wouldn't purchase this pair of ""ears."" Maybe something a little slimmer is in order for you."
1,women's watch #PEL0008,I do not wear this daily and have only had it over a month and it is no longer working and I can't get a refund or exchange.
3,Nice but rather bland and boring...,"This book is solely a compilation of short testimonies of LBGT individuals and their faith journey within the Episcopal Church. I was hoping that this book would be inspirational (it wasn't) and/or a teaching tool that I could use (I doubt it). Some personal accounts were moving, but for the most part, as a Generation X'er, I felt that it was out of touch with the communities that I associate with. This book MIGHT be useful for the general 'late-bloomer' whom is older and just coming into his/her sexuality and is questioning how to integrate their spirituality and faith....and some of the vignettes were quite moving. Overall, just an OK book with an OK rating."
4,Napkin holder and salt and pepper shakers.,"It came fast, I had to use a screwdriver to put it together. But even though I do not use a screwdriver on a regular basis, I was proud that I did not have to ask my husband to put it together. My only complaint was online the color appears to be a brownish-cherrywood color, when it came it was acutally closer to bright red, a little brown color. That is the only reason it did not get 5 stars."
1,Don't waste your money,I opened the package and wasn't disappointed by the looks of the item. I went to assemble the holder and the holes don't match up. Not even close. I had to make new holes and ended up splitting the wood. Now I'm left with a $10 piece of fire wood. I would of been better buying some wood and paint and doing it myself. Cheap Chinese crap. If we weren't so cheap we would still be buying American made. Moral of story get off the buck. !!!!
3,"works as intended, BUT ..","you have to assemble it,and the holes that are drilled in the pieces didn't line up .its not a big issue , i just drilled new holes. someone that don't have a drill and bit that small may have issues with this item. other then that little hiccup it looks nice, and does what its supposed to do."
4,new fan of Radio Theatre,"I was amazed at the believability this audio had! The sounds create images in your mind that make you feel as though you are almost watching it happen. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the story is not complete. I understand that introducing too many characters would be confusing. They used nephew Peter for many more roles than he had in the real story of the Ten Booms. But this slight change does not change the story line at all. I am now reading the book while I wait for my tapes to come back from a dear friend, it is hard to wait!"
4,Good basic info for homeschoolers or anyone who wants to keep up...,"Good basic subjects to keep up on grade level. Don't expect to have this book help your child excel, it's really more for making sure you don't miss anything obvious so it's good for homeschoolers."
1,Not about costumes - summaries of plays instead,This book really does a much better job of giving you the plot of the many plays it touches on rather than what the costumes should look like. The actual costume information could be contained in 10 pages. Some of the information regarding what the characters should wear is questionable. No substance.
1,Review of Jewish Book of Etiquette,"I ordered this book used. It was to be a Chanukah gift. When I recieved the book, I started peeling the library stickers off and the cover started falling apart. I tried to be more careful but the phone rang. Distracted, I kept peeling.... before I knew it, the book was mutilated. Then I lost the book in my own home! I couldn't find it for the holidays! ""Baruch Hashem!"" Sure enough, when the book surfaced, it turned out to be completely useless. This book was filled with philosophical common sense and some interpretation of Torah. If you are looking for modern day advice on tricky social situations, dress codes, appropriate gifts, use of names & titles, etc. look elsewhere."
4,Interesting Selection of Old Church Slavonic Music,"Of the 16th & 17th Centuries Russian & Ukrainian Chants CD is mostly solid music. The listener may not be aware that all such chants originally come from Ukraine and the old Kyivan (Kievan) Rus (old Ukraine), even though they are presented here as ""Russian"". One cut, entitled ""On the Unification of Russia and Ukraine"" is a typical Russian chauvinist interpretation of Ukrainian history. The Russian-Ukrainian unification is a pure fantasy of both the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian government. Enthusiasts of the genre will enjoy this CD, regardless of politics. Today's independent Ukraine and its cultural revival speaks for itself."
3,pretty good,The product was nice and was shipped quickly and arrived two days later. The skirt part is really short so if you are tall it might be a problem...I would give this product 3 stars.
5,Perfect!,I used it for part of a gag gift for the mom-to-be for a French themed baby shower. It was perfect!
3,pedestrian architecture book,"This book covers a great deal of his works in Australia. There were a few mention of his works in European & Asian countries but his root firmly planted in his host country, Autralia. The harsh landscape & the sunny nature of Australia's climate (NSW) provide him with opportunities to tackle various aspects of light & volume (strongly hinting to the International Style) that he's unable to do in European countries. The book reveals the architect's versatility in residential & high-rise developments. A rather informative reference book but paper & picture quality could be better. Suffice to say that this book doesn't break any new ground but it successfully illustrates the accomplishment of a wholesome architect."
1,Please do not waste time reading this book.,"Title of the book is great and that's what I expected in the book. Unfortunately the book is below standards and if you are serious ASP.NET programmer this book is not for you. I have done extensive ASP and ASP.NET programming and so I am aware of most of the problems that occur nearly everyday when developing large enterprise level applications and I tried to finding these issues and best ways to detect them in this book , sadly it has no mention of the problems nor best suggestion for debugging ASP.NET. Additionally in order to make it a book they have topics highly irrelevant to the actual title which should have been the first chapters of some beginner books"
5,Once again another blockbuster!,"This is one of the best quality assurance books in a while... Thinner than Automated Software Testing, but as informative! If you are doing any kind of web testing, this one's a must have for your library. Talks about all aspects of software testing on the web. I give it 5 stars hands down!"
1,Disappointed,I love porches. I want one on my home. I was ready to read about porches. I couldn't get through the introduction of this book. The obvious liberal slant and the use of vulgarity just turned me off. I bet there is some really great information in this book but if I have to be bombarded by the above mentioned I will find my information elsewhere.The pictures were above average. If I could rate the book on the pictures.... give it a 5.
2,"OK toy, less good for serious learning","I'm still learning. The 10 blow needed extra effort to sound; bending other notes takes some work. It's OK if you're honking through ""Oh Susanna"".You can take it apart and adjust the reed gaps, but one cover screw was stripped & needed replacement.If you really want to learn to play, you probably want to spend more & get something like a Hohner Special 20 or a Lee Oskar Major Diatonic."
3,Make Sure to Have Wraps,"The bag isn't a good as I thought it was...very rough on the hands. The last bag I used I could easy use it without wraps...this one is much harder and rougher. It is a step up from the last bag, but you may want to look at other options."
2,Worked well until the balloon leak,"My 100lbs girlfriend hit this thing for 3 months and then it went flat from a leak. I'm not sure if this is the normal timespan or not, since it's the first and only one I've ever had one."
3,Good product,"works for a year or two, but keeps loosing air which you will need to pump up every week or two"
2,speed bag boxing,"did not last much outdoors, even though patio is covered but air comes out easily, had to plug holes couple of times"
1,Does not Last.,"I've been working out on speedbags for 20 years, and never had a bag not hold air until this one. With about ten hours of use it stopped holding air. Not cool. Very disappointing. I do not recommend based on my experience."
2,"Should be the best, but isn't.","Everlast is a well known name for sports equipment....especially boxing, but they fell short on this one. I should have returned it, but waited too long.This bag ( when it holds air ) is not bad....but mine doesn't hold air, constantly have to add air. I'll probably buy another brand speedbag.Had an older version of this bag that wasn't shaped correctly...it was not elliptical, and kept rebounding in different directions, guess I should have known better than to buy another one."
2,Poor worksmanship.,"I found while assembling the dump cart that 4 of the holes on the 2 tow bars were so far off from where they should have been that I ended up filing about 1/4"" of steel to elongate the holes so that the bolts would actually go through both holes. Once I finished putting it together I noticed that the slot on the dump lever was so far off, it would not catch and I ended up also having to take off quite a bit of material from the slot to make it work properly. The dump cart now works fine, but I was extremely disappointed in the lack of care that went into machining the parts for this product."
3,Good look at an important founding father,"Gentleman Revolutionary is not one of those weighty biographies that tells you every minutia related to its subject's life. Since I myself do not enjoy those often-massive tomes, I was pleased with that. Brookhiser's book about Constitutional Convention Delegate Gouvernour Morris is easy to read, covers the important events in Morris' life and leaves the reader much more informed about this Founding Father.I'm a bit surprised it didn't go more into depth about the Constiutional Convention, since the book's subtitle is 'The Rake Who Wrote the Constitution.' Anyone interested in this true American character would do well to start with this very book. It offers a good look at Morris' life without inundating you with every detail from birth to death"
2,A minor character in his own biography,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I am a nut for anything to do with the American Revolution. I'd read Brookhiser's short, concise bio on George Washington and enjoyed it very much.I was so disappointed with this book. Just looking at the cover and reading the blurbs made me expect too much I guess.Morris was known for 3 things: losing his leg, writing the Constitution, and scoring with the ladies. How could his life be turned into a snoozefest?Maybe it's the writing...I just finished reading Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton bigoraphy, which is 3 times longer than this Morris bio. It was absolutely riveting. I was sorry when I finished it; I just did not want it to end. I could not finish the Morris book fast enough; I ended up skipping pages here and there to get to Morris; he seems to be missing in his own biography. Brookhiser gave me no sense as to the kind of man Gouverneur Morris really was.Very disappointing!"
3,"GOOD, BUT . . .","I like the pens pretty well. However . . . they leave behind on the paper a small glob of ink about every 10th word and toward the end of their ""life"" they don't click in and out very well. Sometimes they get stuck in the out position. The ink used on your clear plastic pens that only have a blue or black cover over the ball point don't leave any ink globs behind. Put that ink or that ball in these pens and you'll have a winner."
1,I was disappointed...,"I watched the companion DVD ""Unlocking the Mysteries of Life,"" first, and found it very enlightening. So much so that I was compelled to order Icons of Evolution."" Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I have a hunger for knowledge on the subject of Intelligent Design, and ""Mysteries"" fed that hunger. ""Icons"" did not. It played out like an unbiased but detailed news article where both sides were allowed to sling mud at each other. I've seen enough news articles on the subject, even written one myself for the local newspaper. I understand the controversy, and I don't want to hear about it over and over. I am interested in the science behind ID and Darwinian Evolution.In all fairness, the DVD does live up to its title, if not the hopes inspired by the companion video. :)"
1,Evidence against evolution but for Creation,Gods word hasn't changed but evolution theories continue to evolve as presuppositions about the origin of life baffles those who do not want God in their lives. The fool says in his heart there is no God.
1,BE CAREFUL,"Mr. Johnson is an antievolution thinker, but he's a Lawyer too. That's why he use the words very well, and you can be converted to his way of think. He don't know nothing about Biology or Evolution, nor like Behe, other antievolutionst, but with a some Biology backround, but wrong orientation. See the picture, but see the PBS series ""Evolution"" too, and judge yourself."
1,I wish there was a rating for zero stars!,"This DVD has to be the most insulting piece of garbage I have ever purchased. I normally don't write reviews, but this DVD was so bad I felt compelled to prevent anyone else from making the same mistake I did. There is no scientific basis for this opinion--I refuse to call it a ""theory."" In fact, the piece is full of incorrect and misleading information. I fear that young or uneducated people will be exposed to this, resulting in a perpetuation of the ignorance presented in the video. True scientists do not make claims just to support their own views and or opinions. As to the absence of fossils in certain strata...I believe it was Carl Sagan who said, ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" Don't make the same mistake I did by being fooled into buying this trash, thinking you are buying a scientific piece of work. There is nothing scientific about this trash. Church of Scientology, maybe. I'm sure Tom Cruise has a copy."
3,The book is much better,"After reading the book by the same title, I was not impressed with the DVD. Unlike the book, the DVD relied on evoking an emotional response regarding the high school teacher and Darwin critic who had his teaching suppressed. While that is certainly lamentable, I was hoping for detailed illustration on the more cogent details of the book. The book, unlike the DVD, is fantastic, providing rigorous scientific evidence refuting neo-Darwinism. I am neither a creationist nor a Christian fundamentalist, but I love science and had believed evolution to generally be true. However, after reading Jonathan Wells' book, I was disappointed at how scientists are essentially dismissing dissenting viewpoints to undergird what has become scientific dogma in the face of contradictory evidence. The DVD, however, touches on this theme, and is a good initial exposure."
4,"A moderate success depending on how you look @ it; not as good as the book, but still more beleivable than Establishment ape2man","crap. I am a Christian and do beleive inCreation since it makes more sense thanthe old canard about 'billions of years,""From the goo to the zoo to you"", or 'Fromclods to mods to gods', that the Establish-ment has pushed on three generations of A-mericans now. See also Mr. Kent Hovind Cre-ation Sciences (though I disagree with hiseschotological beliefs), et, al. Also: checkout atlanticbullionandcoindotcom site fortheir Evolution expose!"
2,Dissapointed,"This movie was a disappointment to me. I was expecting more argumentation against evolution. Especially with relation to evolving from Ape-like ancestors. Much could have been said on this topic, but was left untouched. The cover gives the impression that this will be addressed, and it is not. However, there was some good information and anything that promotes a designer is a step in the right direction."
1,science versus a vague feeling of anti-science,"It is unfortunate that there is a market for those who would like to say that the Biology and Geology departments of all of the Universities of the nation are simply wrong, a bunch of blind fools, basically so they can promote a simpler but baseless like like Icons of Evolution. It is sadder still that the fundamentalist religion movement of the 1920s persists today in trying to keep a small religion, rather than broaden their sense of awe accept the real magnificance of the evolution of life and the natural world. The writers try hard to pretend that they opposition to science in general and to evolutionary science in particular is not based on the misconception that have about religion."
5,BEST GIFT EVER!,"I wanted something special to present to my son's BSA outgoing committee chair, she had served for years, and this really fit the bill. She loves it!! The scent is wonderful, and so soothing. It is perfect. I'm dropping hints to my husband so that he buys me one. I will definitely buy this one again, and again."
3,Spa Bath and Body Gift Set,"A birthday gift for my wife, this nicely arrangedbasket containing bath care products was deliveredto our home only four days after the order wasplaced at Amazon.com. She's delighted with theselection of items, thank you.Frederick S."
1,Kidney rescue,Everyone is different but my numbers dropped drastically in the last 4 months and they had held pretty steady over the last 5 years. There was not much change during that time.I am in stage 4 kidney failure and my son got these for me to try. I hope I haven't done myself harm by taking this product for three months. Like I say everyone is different but I was so disappointed when my blood tests came back. :(It could have just been my time to spiral downward. The service was good but because my numbers drastically dropped I am giving it one star.
1,A snake oil salesman,Swoboda was nothing more than a con man. The AMA medical journal exposed him for the huckster that he was. His disciples were made to believe that they could regenerate lost limbs through sheer NERVE FORCE. He has a small cult like following today from a mentally weak group. Don't waste your time or money on this hocus pocus nonsense.
1,Disappointing,"The claims made on behalf of Swoboda fall apart under scrutiny, and yes; the AMA called him a ""quack."" One exercise forum claims Swoboda was an important influence on Houdini, yet he's never mentioned in any of Houdini's biographies, and apparently the curator of the Houdini museum said he'd never heard of Alois P. Swoboda. Swoboda claimed to be able to re-grow lost limbs? Hmmm..."
3,The Real Number System DVD,This DVD was very informative and filled with the details of the real number system. It was narrated by the writer as if you were listening to a lecture with graphics. Very dry and boring; nothing flashy about it.
1,Where does this work?,Its not a CD-G as claims and will not play in my karokee machine that plays my CD'S. I wonder if this was just mislabeled. It may be a great product but it won't play so I wouldn't know.
3,Some good ideas,"Build Your Child's Self Esteem offers 365 ways to affirm and encourage a child. Some of the ideas are good but others seem simplistic and idealistic such as ""Put positive mottoes up in your child's room and he can learn them by heart."""
1,Painful !!!,"This product does not work for me! The band portion of the splint goes right across the sore part of my knuckle causing me a great deal of discomfort. It does immobilize, but this is only of value to you if you are having no issues with pain. I cannot return this item because this seller does not accept returns after 30 days AND they charge a restocking fee! Really? A fee to restock an item that weighs nothing and is the size of a quarter? I'm 56 years old and I still live and learn! Unbelieveable."
1,dont buy,they dont accually send you the one in the photo. dont get!! it is not compatible with the handhelds!!!
5,Every recipe I've tried is a winner,I can't wait to try more recipes from this book. Everything I've made so far has been great. No need to experiment or modify these recipes at all as with some other cookbooks; just follow the instructions and enjoy a delicious meal. There are many out of the ordinary recipes with bold flavor combinations. Great when you want to make something new and different without any risk.
4,Simple and delicious,"I love this book too. Most of the recipes are terrific. The endive, pear and roquefort salad is a staple for company, and I love the interesting footnotes ""the clever cook could add....."". Lets you be creative. A nice book, with nice photos. I just ordered her other book on Summer entertaining. Highly recommend this one!"
5,Seriously Easy,"My sister bought this book for me, knowing that with two small children I don't have much time to prepare gourmet meals. This book gives some great ideas on how to prepare fabulous meals easily and with little time required. I especially love how the author includes ""the clever cook could"" section to most of the recipes which gives ideas on how one could serve any leftovers or jazz up the meal. The photographs are beautiful as well. I think this book would make a wonderful gift to anyone who loves to cook or just wants a change from what they usually prepare at mealtime."
1,Not All That Enjoyable,This book was WAY too analytical and not at all enjoyable to read. It drew conclusions which weren't at all substantiated by the shows writing nor the acting in this series. The writer should stick to academia and leave the enjoyment of just watching shows like this to the rest of us!
3,Minnie Pear the Queen of Comedy,This was a pretty good cd if you are looking for the good old family entertainment without having to worry about being offended. This was a great investment as she was and always will be the Queen of Comedy. I have never heard these stories before so that was a breath of fresh entertainment.
5,My favorite new book!,"This is my new favorite book. I couldn't put it down and when I finished it, I wanted it to go on. It was very excititing."
2,The cable is enough,I only bought the cradle because of the S video out. But so far I am still not able to make it work.
4,A difinitive work.,"Agnes Michels was the foremost expert in the Roman calendar. This book is now out-of-print and hard to find at a reasonable price. I expect that it is a little dated by now, but have yet to find a newer book of such academic caliber; most calendar books today I would call 'paperback academic.'"
1,Does not work as advertised,"Just to clarify- while this product advertises as being compatible with PS3, it is NOT. It's designed for PC."
3,Works for controllers but not Guitars,The Adaptor I found will work on any standard analog PS2 controller but I had problems with it working for the guitars used in Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Mostly the orange button wasnt functioning but if your playing on easy or medium its not that big of a problem. Also getting the guitar to go into star power was practically impossible. So In conclusion great for controllers not so good for guitars.
1,Not work!,"Yeh once again another convrter that semi works, it will hit buttons but wont hit buttons in combination so not work for gh2 or ddr style pads... shame because you would think they wouldn't be so cruel as to sell a product that half works but looks like they do."
1,Did not work for GH 2 or 3 For Me.,"Despite the other review I was unable to make this adapter work with Guitar Hero II controllers. Maybe there is some magic I missed but the adapter comes with no documentation so I don't know what else try.On occasion, after some fiddling I was able to get two of the fret buttons to work but that was it. There is no way I can see to force the PS3 into analog mode for the guitar since there is no PS button on this adapter.Avoid this adapter if you want to use GH controllers. Find one specifically designed for the purpose."
2,Really disappointing,"I usually like swedish children's books, but this one really disappoints. It's boring and mostly consists of Sam refusing to sit on the potty and putting his dog on the pottyMy three year old was not impressed at all."
1,Good effort - but not quite there,"These translated Swedish books have a simple text with picture format. The pages are hard to turn for me let alone the little one, and the pictures are rough and unengaging. I am staying away from all of the Sam's titles."
1,Not worth my money,I understand that silver is a fine metal yet I am very disgusted that I have this product under a month and it is not worth throwing over the hill...had I only paid $5 it may have been worth it.
2,"Fun, but some problems","For die-hard fans (like myself) this book is good, I did like the Arms and Armor section, and the games and stuff are cool. What really bothers me is some loss of continuity with the rest of the Dragonlance world. The most glaring example comes as a footnote in the aformentioned Arms and Armor section where Laurana was supposedly standing next to Sturm Brightblade while shooting a dark knight, I assume that means knights of Takhisis/Neraka which did not exist until 20 yr after Sturm died. Also, elves getting married at 20 yrs old or something, I thought they weren't even adults until the age of 80. If you can get past these few problems, though, it really can be an enjoyable read, but for the best filler information pick up one of the Leaves From the Inn of the Last Home titles."
1,Piece of Crap!!!,"This shirt ""Brand New"" had the Mavericks logo alredy worn off. Looked like a 10 year old worn shirt."
1,Don't by from Deals on Call,"The company listing this, Deals on Call, does not have any contact information in its ad. If you have damage in transit as I do, you go to the link where you purchased the item and see it was supplied by Taylor Markets. However they won't replace damaged items because they're not the direct sellers. A big run around. Avoid Deals on Call."
3,Not Many Hits,"Anything Dolly sings, she sings well but this album is really a no hitter. It's nice background music on a long road trip and has some stories to tell."
1,Still waiting for hardware,"Ordered (1) chair (1) Loveseat and (2) ottoman. Recived in 4 seperate shipments at 4 different dates. Chair was first to arrive but did not have hardware or instructions to put it together. Been 3 weeks now and I have called several times. You have to contact the manufacturer directly. At least they have an 800# so as I call EVERY day it's not costing me anything. Loveseat came with a little damage, that I can touch up myself. Overall for the price I paid for all this den furniture, I would have rather seen it in a store and taken delivery myself."
1,milano mocha chair,"This has been a nightmare. When I received the chair I couldn't wait to put it together. However the holes for the screws were too big and therefore I was unable to secure the pieces. I called and asked if the the right size screws could be sent. I was told that there were no provisions for that, but they would be happy to send me another one. (I could return the faulty one in that box.) Very nice I thought. Well I got the second one. THE SCREWS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE HOLES! Now I am stuck with chair parts all over the house and no chair to sit on! I don't recommend this item."
2,Could be sturdier.,"We had this chair for 14 months... I sat down and it broke. I'm under 200 lbs. The front end of the chair gave way. It turns out there isn't a lot support around the edges that hold the cushion up. When I sat down, screws that held the cushion up ripped from the frame. The screws were only about 1/4 inch from edge of frame, if that.If you want inexpensive. This chair may be for you. Just don't expect long life.Update 9/27/08went to home depot and got a 1/4 inch thick piece of plywood cut to fit chair. Cushion back on top... an inexpensive fix! Good as new!"
4,"Good value, comfortable chair","This chair looks nice, is reasonably comfortable, and is a good value. We bought two just to ""fill in"" a room so we'd have more seating capacity. The seat is firm and comfortable, great for reading, though I don't choose it for relaxing to watch TV or so. The seat is a little too firm for me to sit in more than an hour or so (as if I every really get to sit that long), but the firmness and shape are perfect for a short read, or sitting and chatting for a while. Ours was easy to put together and did not have major flaws. It looks like it costs more than it did."
3,Great Disposable Furniture,"I know... disposable furniture. I hate to say it as much as you hate hearing it (especially at this price) but its true. I have this chair and the sofa and I really like it. But after about a month of light use with the sofa I already know i will have to be careful if I want it to look as nice as when I bought it. Construction is good. Fabric quality is good as well but dont expect to get 4 or 5 years out of it if you actually do any living in your living room.Also, its not as comfortable as one would like. The padding is thick but stiff. Maybe i have to break it in but how do I do that without making a big dent in the cushion?Price wise, you will be smart to check and see if these items are available at local furniture stores. If I had to do it over again I would still buy this collection of furniture but would have waited for the price to drop for it to be a sure bet. And I would also opt for the Rust and Black which looks pretty hot."
5,"They look very expensive, I love them","I love these chairs. <br />They were not as difficult to put together as others have said. I get great compliments. They look like I bought them at one of the more expensive furniture stores. I have an antique wood table that I put in the middle and it looks great. People can't believe that I bought them from Target! I was lucky, I got them when they were on sale so it was a great deal. But the price is still good. My mother-in-law saw them and now I am online to buy her two for her little apt! Target has come a long way with their collection. <br />"
3,"Not bad, but...","The book is well written and logical. However, the online test simulations leave much to be desired. Many of the questions are not multiple choice, but require the student to type in an explanation which the software almost invaribly marks wrong (even true and false questions require the user to type in ""true"" or ""false""). In fact, some of the ""correct"" answers provided by the application are not correct at all (HSRP does not stand for Heirarchical Standard Routing Protocol!) If you're looking for an accurate simulation of the exam, look elsewhere."
3,Good content -- but terrible editing/proofreading,"I am a beginner to technical certs -- CCDA will be my first one. That being the case, this book often confuses more than educates, because of poor editing/proofreading. Some sentences are incomplete, conflict with other text, or are just outright mistakes. This also applies to the practice test -- some of the test's ""correct"" answers are simply WRONG, when compared to the text in the book.If you are like me, and would rather learn without the distraction of grammar, spelling, and other errors, KEEP SHOPPING. I wish I had."
3,Better products out there,I bought this humidifier in 2004 from the now defunct Sharper Image store. It WORKS WELL but the noise is troublesome at the highest setting. We set it the lowest level so it doesn't bother us while we sleep and it lasts us a little more than 2 days. The only other problem I have with it is that it doesn't have a water guage to remind me to fill the tank. I would only recommend this humidifier for people who are hard of hearing or people who live by the highway so you want to drown out the ambient noise.
1,Tampered Products,"A wonderful set, but let me get straight to the point.TWICE, not once, but TWICE my family ordered this product, presuming that it would arrive intact. Unfortunately, TWICE we discovered that the body lotion in the first shipment had been punctured andan 1/4 of the product ALREADY USED.In the second shipment, the body lotion AND the shower gel had been punctured and 1/4 used.This not only is a huge disappointment in quality control, but a hygienic issue. Frankly, it is disgusting to think that someone had dipped their fingers into body lotion and shower gel previously, and then nicely wrapped up the package as if nothing was wrong.I am extremely disappointed at 'Art of Appreciation's complete lack of Quality Control. I am NEVER buying from them again."
4,Nice gift,"This was purchased as a gift for my mom. She was quite impressed with it... said it smelled wonderful and was really pretty. There was, however, no gift card or notice anywhere on the box telling her who it was from."
5,"Read & listen carefully, and then take them to heart!","I too, heard the song first and it's another beautiful and soul touching song by Lee Ann Womack! I think we all want to leave something worth leaving behind, and unfortunately when most people think of what people will remember them by when they are gone from this earth, is that they had to do big thing like in art, or that they had to write music, something big.Well, no... the something you leave behind... is being the best parent you can be to your child, and it's something we all can do! This is a wonderful book for all parents, both new and old! And if you have never heard the song before, have a tissue within reach! This book comes with the cd."
1,WORST EVER,"Ended up getting these for free plus sales tax after using Mfg coupon.Their motto should be: ""For those who hate life! Easy suicide method!""At free plus sales tax on $3.99 which is approx $0.32 cents for 4 or 3 (I tried both the pink 3 blade and the purple 4 blade) I paid too much.I am writing the company for some real complaining."
1,Good for vampires,"I bought two packages of these because they were a great deal. I opened them and tried one for the first time yesterday. I have been shaving my legs for 25 years so I am not exactly a novice. I shaved my legs like I always do and didn't notice any problems. Then as I started to rinse my legs, they started bleeding. All over. My legs bled on and off for the next 3 hours. My shins have deep little cuts, not shaving nicks all up them. I have never had a worse shaving experience. My legs hurt and look awful. Thanks to this awesome product, I have to wear pants on the 4th of July. Having a hamburger is a fun way to spend the holiday. Looking like hamburger really isn't. I cannot believe this product is being sold."
1,Disappointed,"I tried these razors as an alternative to another brand of disposable razors I had been using as they were a bit less expensive. I guess you get what you pay for.I am a careful shaver and have 10 years experience under my belt, but these with these razors I nicked myself ever time I shaved (mostly around ankles and knees).Also, the shave was never close! I would get out of the shower and feel a slight hint of stubble resulting from a poor shave. I only ever used one razor for a max of two times before I had to replace it (I usually like to use them more than that and usually can!!) and even then it still wasn't good. I'm happy I'm through the pack now and will go back to my old brand!!!"
1,boooooo. noxema should stick with cold creme.,"boooooo. noxema should stick with cold creme. What a disappointment. I didn't choose to buy these razors. It wasn't until I was home unpacking bags that I realized I was charged for them. I had a $300 grocery load and don't even remember what I paid for them. Rather than be hassled by returning them, I thought, I'll just use them. What a mistake. I don't have time for them. It would take several swipes, and still leave hairs. I had a couple problems with cuts, not like the other reviews. I would buy the most generic single blade 10 pack of disposables before I would ever consider buying these. And if it happens again (that they make it into my bag with out me knowing) you better believe they're going back to the store!"
1,Painful and Doesn't Work,"I purchased these razors because they seemed like a great deal. I paid $3.00 for a 6 pack (4 + 2 bonus) and they're made by Noxzema, so I thought they would be pretty decent. I thought wrong! I had to go over a patch of skin several times for the razor to even remove any hair. When it did finally get a some of the hair the razor would just become clogged. I was constantly having to stop to rinse it under a sharp stream of water. Worst of all, in spite of using shaving cream, after I finished I was left with nasty razor burn up and down my legs and underarms. Noxzema definitely needs to rethink this product. I'm not sure how they can sell these in good conscience."
1,"These are awful, worse than the pink one blade cheapo razors!","I bought these razors on sale, thinking that Noxzema was a trusted brand. I could not have been more wrong. They somehow manage to both remove all your skin, leaving you legs raw while NOT removing the hair. I suspect I'd get better results with those pink Daisy razors. Avoid at all costs, even if they are on sale."
1,Worst Disposable Razors. Ever.,"I purchased these razors because they were on sale and came in cute colors and since I am not brand loyal to any particular disposable razor, figured what the hell. I've purchased cheap-o disposable razors that will nick my skin or even sting my skin, but never have I ever used razors that don't even really shave. Don't let the ""4 blade"" name fool you. You will have to shave over the same spot about 10-15 times to really get the hair shaved. Even then you don't get a clean, smooth shave. I thought that perhaps it was only the one razor in the pack so I quickly disposed of it and went for a new razor. I had the same problem with all the razors in the pack. It makes me wonder if Noxzema does any QA in its manufacturing. Do not waste any money on these razors!!!"
1,Worst razor I've ever used,I had to re examine the package and make sure I hadnt picked up Noxzema Butter knives. What a waste of plastic.
4,SabreLite 2000,"I bought the SabreLite 2000 because I wanted a flashlight that was small enough to put in a glove compartment or throw in a suitcase. I also wanted one that ran on C-size batteries. When I received the SabreLite 2000, I was very impressed with its rugged, high quality design and construction, and, more than satisfied with the brightness of its light. The flashlight has extra features I was not especially aware of when I bought it, such as safety certifications, luminescent shroud, and the fact that it is submersible. The only drawback I have experienced is that the flashlight is turned on and off by tightening or loosening the shrouded end of the flashlight and I am more accustomed to using a switch. I would definitely purchase the SabreLite 2000 again, but, I expect this one will last for many years."
2,In Old Arizona,"The 1st film shot on location using Fox's sound-on-film ""Movietone"" process. It had a huge novelty effect when released late in 1928; the contemporary critics all wax rhapsodic. They were especially wowed by a close-up of ham and eggs cooking with synchronous sizzling sounds! It is worth seeing for historical interest, but it's really quite bad. The Cisco Kid's initial holdup is basically the only action scene, the rest is a very, *very* talky talkie shot on soundstages with a Rock of Gibraltar camera. Warner Baxter & Dorothy Burgess are risible as ""Latinos"", & Edmund Lowe i...s hardly better affecting a New Yawk accent & ending every single line with ""Geez"". Gains 1 point for a cold-blooded twist ending that the 1934 code would have nixed & the aforementioned historical interest. 4/10"
3,Historic Movie Firsts for In Old Arizona,"This Fox Film was the first feature talking film making use sound-on-film as opposed to the Vitaphone system which used synchronized recorded disks. This was also the first talkie shot outdoors, and outdoors it was with location shoots all over the southwest deserts from Arizona to Zion National Park to Joshua Tree and the Grand Canyon. The film reflects its early sound origins and hopefully the film video will be digitally restored and cleaned up. The original director, Raoul Walsh, sidelined during filming by an auto accident, gained experience in sound recording on location which he put to good use on his next Fox Film The Big Trail."
3,OK but radials are fragile,I have this antenna mounted on a motorhome roof with a swivel mount to lay it down while driving. Even laid down I've broken several radials on overhanging tree branches then they have to be drilled out and you can't buy just one radial you have to buy 6 so I ended up soldering a heavy copper wire into the radial hole. Aside from that it's an ok antenna.The plastic housing is for a coil inside and unneeded. Be careful drilling out the broken radials as it's easy to nick the coax.
4,A definite game for those Spidey fans!!,"CHEAT CODES:CLUBNOIR, MME WEB, SM LVIII, MRWATSON, KICK ME, XILRTRNS, SYNOPTIC, TRISNTNL, MIGUELOH, SECRTWAR, RULUR, ADMNTIUM, LEANEST, WEAKNESS, GLANDSWith the following cheat codes you will be the master of this game in no time!!!! My five year old cousin can play this game, but has a little trouble because of his young age. There is no blood."
1,Poorly Written Software-PATHETIC SUPPORT,"First off, it is a fun, simple game. But when you cannot fight one of the main bosses in the game, Scorpion, becuase of a bug, and when you contact Activision's support they will only offer you a cheat code to skip that level. WHY are you buying a game in the first place?! Don't you want to play ALL the levels, and EARN them wihtout cheat codes?!I'll never buy another piece of software from Activision until they get a patch for this. I have the same problem on THREE different pc's (1 win98 and 2 XP's)."
1,3D,"Overall the game is great! I had some problems with some of the levels [game wouldn't let me play that level] other than that it's great. The cheet codes are admntium, glands, leanest, mme web, and uatusees. I would by this game IT ROCKS!!"
2,I want my money back,"IT LOOKED REALLY COOL BECAUSE IT WAS 3D. I WAS SO EXSITED TO WIN THE GAME, BUT WHEN I GET TO THE 2nd level it didn't let me finish . IT WOULDN'T LLET ME GET PAST THE LEVLE, IT KEPT REPEATING THE INTRO OVER AND OVER AND OVER. I WOULDN'T BUY IT BUT I HOPE THEY MAKE A GAME SIMMILAR TO IT [ONE THAT IS BETTER]."
4,spider-man,"I like the game, but I am having problems with the game, Can someone help me with the missle game. I bought this hints&solutions book guide,I thought would help me, No! it doen'ts help. If someone can email me on where to find the right book for the mac version."
1,You don't just play it.... you sleep through it.,"In this game, you can shoot webs, swing across the sky and fight evil through many levels. Sound like fun? think again. This game was one of the worst I've ever played. Each level is tightly scripted, and offers little exploration and freedom. The bosses, freak-specimens, criminals and other evil dwellers that you come across are so similar it's boreing. Though they look different, they fight the same. A punch here...A shot there, it gets dull fast. The levels are repetitive, and it becomes a real chore to play through the game. The graphics arn't the best and the sound sucks. Don't wast your money on this game."
5,Good for transition out of pull ups!,"Just as described. Works well as long as your little one doesn't roll off of it! I might try the kind with the tuck under wings from the same manufacturer as these sometimes end up getting bunched up under my boys, letting the sheets get wet. We have this on top of a waterproof mattress protector to keep the laundry washing to a minimum, but I would not rely on one of these alone to keep your mattress from getting wet. These have held up to almost daily washing over the last few months. They may be a little hot once summer comes as they have a plastic inner layer for the waterproofing, but I am hoping we won't need them any more by then.I would recommend having about 3-4 of these to keep in rotation so you don't have to scramble to wash them every morning and so that there is a backup for wet nights! Would recommend to others."
3,Good Product for the Price but There was a Broken screw,"I loved the item for the price it was worth it. However, the screw on the bracket was broken in half. It still could be put together but it took several efforts to get it up. Its an attractive item and I got a good deal. I figured something was going to be wrong for such a reduction in price."
1,This is a RIP OFF!!,It's hard to believe that a glass shelf would originally cost so much and even at the discounted price it's still twice the cost of the exact same item when purchased from the manufacturer via Walmart online. Even though the shipping cost with Walmart adds just under $6 it's still a better deal than this.
4,An Excellent Sequel!,"Silent Warrior continues Gerswin's quest to restore and rebuild a nuclear war ravaged Earth in the face of opposition from a powerful galactic empire. In this, the second part of the trilogy, Modesitt examines both the political and economic labyrinths that Gerswin has to navigate through to to gain the leverage he needs to accomplish his massive undertaking. The book's also not short on action, as Gerswin has to battle and outwit the assasins guild, commerical rivals and the galactic intelligence service, while trying to keep his agenda and the fact that he's immortal hidden."
5,Trans lines!!!,Worked great!! Perfect match .All lines bent just as factory lines and come with all brackets needed to secure lines to factory locations.No leaks present after replacement.
2,Wait till you try to get the lables off of this bowl.,"The bowl itself is of good quality but you will spend more time then anyone should have to removing the labels. Hot water, goo be gone, lighter fluid with lots of scraping all used to remove them."
2,False description,"This product is simply not as advertised, as described; ""25' Length"". I ordered 4 lengths of 25 feet because that is what I needed. There were cheaper options that could not be guaranteed 25 foot lengths. Some reviews of the 50 foot reels pointed out that the lengths were intermittently cut. This was true of all four lengths I ordered. The longest was probably 20 feet, the shortest perhaps 17 feet. Each 25' length purchased was actually two pieces each with seemingly random cuts. For $175 it's nice to receive what you pay for. Not a good first experience with Amazon."
3,"decent, but could be cheaper",The actual latex is just what I expected--same thing as what would be found at a hardware store...Only problem is... its a bit expensive no matter where i go...three stars for price
5,Playing out of your mind,This is a very good book but for high school age and up. Younger kids will not appreciate it as much.
4,Recommended...,This book is great!! At first it was a bit overwhelming for me to read at a younger age with all of the information being spat out at you but I quickly got used to it and started using the techniques it talked about in the book...I would definitely recommend it to any soccer players who are serious about their game.
1,"A lot of info, but not for me",I felt this book's information was way beyond me. Guess you have to be more advanced in color design than I am.
3,Not suited for the toddler set,"My daughter loves reading the Madeline series and I bought this to stoke her interest further. That said it is really more for older children, the quality is not the best but it is an older cartoon. I am hoping she will enjoy this in a few years."
5,a great book,"I have been teaching the Odyssey for many years, but The Wrath of Athena has further enlightened what I would say about the whole epic poem but particularly what I would impart to my students about the study of Odysseus' confronting Polyphemus. I'm delighted a colleague of mine recommended this as an aid to my studies.The freshmen at my upper school have always enjoyed reading all of this epic poem, but this added information will make it more so for them--and for me."
4,The Best of Mozart Vol. 2,"Mozart is one of my favorite classical composers. I have both Vol. 1 and Vol. II in a 2 cd set. Volume 1 has Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, The Marriage of Figaro Overture, and Symphony No. 29 in A-Major.VOL. II1. Turkish March (Rondo Alla Turca) 3:322. Fantasy, D-Minor 4:563. The Magic Flute 8:594.

2,Millions,"The accents were too heavy for my kids to really catch most of the words, and it was a little wierd for my kids to understand. I have a 10 and 12 year old. The sound was very bad, words and dialogue too soft and music way way too loud."
1,Would give it a big fat zero if I could,"This is NOT a movie for the kids. Adult situations include the police telling the boys that their home in likely to be burglarized in the near future due to the affluence of the neighborhood, the boys using the internet to view women in their underwear, a ridiculously buxom blonde with cleavage to her navel speaking in an advertisement for changing over from the pound sterling to the euro, and a creepy stranger approaching the boys near the railroad tracks. We got it to watch with our kids based in reviews here and on [...], but both missed the mark. The is NOT a kids' movie. In addition, the dialog is very hard to understand due to heavy British accents (and I mean heavy; this is not Harry Potter),and the cinematography is often downright weird. Unusual can be good, but here it's just weird. A big fat zero from us."
2,"Wholesome, weird, and dull","This picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick. A rather pointless attempt to remake Brewster's Millions with an altruistic slant. It wasn't a ""bad"" movie it simply wasn't a ""good"" one. Boooooooring...zzzz..zzzz..zzzz"
1,"Mind-numbing, insulting pap","The film, in a nutshell: believe in everything and everybody, and all your dreams will come true, even if your dreams are totally self-centered.This love song to naive altruism and religion is relentless in its Disney cotton-candy ending. Make it stop! No matter how much you want it to stop, it will not stop. You'll find yourself rooting for the Satanic, 5-o'clock shadowed bearded guy.But if you hate reason and love blind belief and the government, you'll probably love this movie. You can have it."
1,crap pure crap so much crap you cant even flush the toliet,"this movie had such an english accent to it, it took me like the first 20 mins to figureout what the crap they were saying! now the whole saint thing i didnt get why thats in there also the nipple thing i mean you could see the nipple that was okward so dont watch this movie."
3,Magical,"Millions is a magical family movie. It has something many movies lack - moral. The plot is simple and yet beautiful. Even if the English accents are hard to understand, the movie is still a joy to way. A mix of magic, imagination and morals."
3,Almost Good - Definitely Original,"Delightful story of a boy who thinks a million pounds thrown from a train is a gift from God. All he wants to do is give the money away to the poor, but his financially astute older brother has other ideas. The boys periodic chats with long-dead saints adds a nice touch of history and fantasy. Two things spoil the movie, however. There is some embarrassingly obvious product-placement ads and there is a scene of a near-naked lingerie model that turns an otherwise family-friendly movie into something that can cause parents to blush."
3,"DANNY BOYLE, OPUS 6","*** 2004. Directed by Danny Boyle. How to spend two hundred thousands pounds in a week when you are a child ? This British comedy is fun to watch, well filmed and it says two or three important things about money. Give it a chance."
4,"a sweet, tender, inspiring film","Before Danny Boyle changed the world with his portrayal of the Indian slums inSlumdog Millionaire, he made this comedy/fantasy film that strives to pinpoint the important things in life. The film is truly refreshing and there are parts of it that seem real. The poignant parts are truly uplifting. At the end of the day, Millions is a movie about learning to let go off preconceived notions and adjusting to loss and letting go of those we love."
4,"""Millions""","Wanted to give it to a friend, who is very religious, to read to her grandchildren. She approved. I also like it very much, and think Danny Boyle""s work is great."
3,"Sweet, but still winning","Takes a while, but ultimately you're hooked by this fable. The kids are real finds, they do a great job. Saints preserve us."
3,Not a family movie,"I kept hearing how great this movie was, and it was marketed for families. I was really disappointed from that aspect, and feel that many of the themes would be confusing to children under age twelve or thirteen. There is a ""saint"" that smokes, another that explains how Jesus' miracle of feeding the five thousand was not a miracle at all (the people actually had their own food but were too selfish to share it at first), and a scene where the youngest son walks in on his father in bed with a woman they barely knew. I did not find any of this to family fare. For adults, the movie is intriguing, and the acting, especially by the young boys, is terrific. Just don't watch it with your kids."
2,Interesting but...,"The story had promise and the production is good quality. Money, love, childhood dreams, death of a parent, right and wrong...all these elements are present as the story unfolds. But in the end, I was left wondering if I missed something. Not a bad movie, but certainly not a great one."
5,Sweet but not Sickly,"My wife and I loved this little film. The Amazon critic and others have pretty much summed up the plot and story so I'm not going to rehash those points. I'll just add that it is beautifully shot and all of the kids in this film know how to act without being corny. Quite honestly, this film left me wishing I could be young and unblemished by the world again. It reminded me of who I once was before I reached middle age with all of its accompanying disappointments and cynicism. This film is sweet without being ""goopy"" or sickly. I believe it will leave you thinking about who you could be once again. Buy it or at the very least put it on your Netflix list."
5,What a wonderful film!,"I can't say enough about how warm and inspiring little film this is. If it doesn't leave you a little misty eyed but feeling good, then go to your doctor because there is something wrong with you.I'm not sure what all this nonsense is about soft porn and not being a family movie.I mean, perhaps I missed something, but I don't recall having seen any nudity at all in this film. There was one scene in which the boys were having a discussion about what nipples were for, but they were looking at a bra-clad breast.And what's with the European jabs?"
3,A Diamond in the Rough,"People looking for pleasant background music to relax to might enjoy this album.Charlene Lockwood has a lot of potential. This album has its weaknesses, but the music itself appeals to me deeply. It suffers mainly from threadbare production, weak vocalists, and a certain inhibition of the nascent passion locked within. However, I think that the right producer could really bring out all of the hidden facets in her talent, and let her real light shine through.The music's strengths lie in its lyrical authority, its sweetness, and especially its feeling. She has done a nice job. She could do better. With proper encouragement and backing, she will."
3,"A decent mug, but with concerns","I should have listened to the one review that mentioned it was not the color shown - but I thought I would take a chance and see for myself. I also ordered Eggplant but it is black and I don't see any hint of purple in my mug. Also, I would suggest to the company that they make the seal on the open/close tab for sipping a little stronger and tighter. The mug will leak quite a lot if it is tipped or josteled in the car. Overall, it is a decent mug for keeping your drink hot and it is easy to clean - I just wish the color would be truer and the open/close seal tab on top would be stronger."
5,Great travel mug,Keeps coffee hot and doesn't leak. All pluses when it comes to buying a travel mug.
1,What are you talking about ? My coffee was NOT HOT!,I purchased this based on the great reviews. REALLY??? This didn't my coffee hot for 10 minutes. I even put boiling hot water into the mug with the lid on and let it sit for about 15 minutes to make it hot before I poured the coffee into it.Still searching for a mug to keep my coffee hot for about 2 hours.
2,Good insulation but lid doesn't seal,"I bought 2 of these from Amazon a few months ago. They look great and keep coffee hot for hours. The problem is that the lids leak. They barely resist splashing while I'm walking around but if I tip the mug the contents just pours out. The little plastic slide just isn't designed to do much of anything. It's not a seal, at best it reduces splashing a bit.With all of the positive reviews here, I decided to email customer service. I never received a response.It's a decent office mug but doesn't really work for a travel mug."
1,Awful!,"The lid does not screw on, nor does it have enough suction to adhere it securely to the tumbler. Hence, when placed in my tote bag, lid came off (twice) and tote got soaked. Neither does it keep liquids hot for any amount of time."
4,KTisahusker,"Great item. Works well. I ordered the Eggplant color and it looks more of a dark grey/blue, definitely NOT purple."
2,50/50,"Heavy and what we thought good quailty. Then, we realized the thermometer does not work. The company was great, initially. I sent an e-mail with the problem & they sent me a new one right away. However, the new one has the same problem. I e-mailed back about the new one and I have yet to get a response! It would be a 5 star if the thermometer worked."
5,Simply Amazing,"Through an insightful counterpoint of describing the Afghan or Pashtun's womens' plight and the womens' poetic responses, this volume of Afghan womens' poetry brings a new understanding to a culture that is little comprehended in the Western world. Many Western women might ask how the Pashtun women survive the life they've been given, but these landays answer that question and more. Defiant, rebellious, poignant and heart wrenching, these two line poems allow a view into a world that is little known or understood. An amazing book and highly recommended!"
2,Not good enough for college,"This book may give you the ""meat and potatoes"" of sociology but unfortunetly it doesn't give you more than that. If your goal is to put some of your curiosity into perspective this is propably the book. But if you want to understand the field of sociology as an academic discipline this suffers from not focusing on theories but on themes. It will spark the ""sociological imagination"" but I will not read the book again and again.This book may be helpful in high school but for college and up you need to supplement (or replace) it with one which focus on theories and theorists like ""Classical & Modern Social Theory"" by Heine Andersen and Lars Bo Kaspersen which is the best introduction to theorists from Marx to Giddens IMO. THIS is the book that will follow me always."
4,Not so bad worth it for the price,I thought it would be a flimsy skinny book. In reality its pretty big and its worth for what i had gotten it for. I do recommend it to anyone thats doubting buying a book because they feel unsure.
1,Too long!,"I ordered this book along with two others, I received the others in a reasonable amount of time, a little over a week, I ordered them so I would get them in time for school, unfortunately I still have not received this one. It has now been almost three weeks."
1,Intro to Soc,"I ordered the book by author, title and edition. But this book is extremly old and useless to me. I should have ordered it by the ISBN. My prof. used this when HE was in college back in the 70's. It's in GREAT shape though!"
3,a rebuttal to the first review,Onesimus was a brother because he became a christian not because Paul adopted him. Paul was speaking spritually. Thats why Paul was sending Onesimus back to his master or Paul would have kept him with himself if he was an adopted child. Onesimus was a runaway slave and had to go back to his master but Paul didn't want his master to be mean to him so he said accept him as you would me. I just wanted to correct the first review on this issue. Thank you for your time.
1,Causing the weak to stumble,"Peter Marshall is on a mission -- to reinterpret American history from a ""Christian"" perspective. Since the end is known to him (""God planned it all out"") then his job is simply one of finding facts that support his thesis and ignoring those that don't. Marshall is better able to do this due to his lack of training as a historian. Books such as Marshall (along with Manuel's) provide fodder for intellectually honest people to look at all Christians as suckers for any moving story, regardless of its inauthenticity."
1,BEWARE - THEY ARE VERY WIDE!!!,"These are fine gates, technically speaking, and they work well, but they are incredibly wide and don't fit ANY of our doorways!! Silly me, I didn't think to measure before ordering because I assumed that no one would sell a gate that was wider than the average doorway/hallway/stair, and so now I have to deal with shipping them back. So measure very carefully before ordering these!!!"
5,Dreambaby gate with extensions,The product arrived in a timely manner. It was easy to put together and functions as described.
5,Best gate in the market. PERIOD.,I have two of these for my 13 month old walking twins. They have been pressure mounted. Nothing they do can move or open these. The gates and extensions are expensive but worth every cent. My kitchen and bedroom are no kids zone :) Make sure you measure the openings well and get appropriate extensions. The only slight negative is that the plastic latch feels cheap and breakable but it has not broken yet after 2 months of constant use...
5,Great product,"We have an extra wide doorway we needed to gate off. This gate works great and is very sturdy, despite having several extensions on each side of the gate door."
2,"Difficult to Install for a ""Pressure-Mounted"" Gate","I purchased this gate largely based on positive reviews and on the need for a gate to fit a wide opening. I wanted a pressure-mounted gate so that I would not have to mount hardware on my doorframes. This gate was much harder to install than what I would have expected for something advertised as a pressure-mounted gate. In order to be installed properly, it required mounting cups on the door frame, either with screws or with double-sided tape, which defeated the purpose of getting a gate that did not require modification of the door frame. Trying to install the whole thing tightly enough to get the gate portion to align properly without the cups would have gouged the doorframe. I returned this item and purchased a First Years gate that was much easier to install and with which I am extremely happy."
3,Meh...it's just OK...,"It does the trick for now but as my daughter gets older (currently 13 months) and stronger, I think she'll be able to push it open/over. Pressure mount gates will never be great, period. BUT...it's nice to have something that doesn't require permanent drilling and holes."
2,Top Part Of Latch Quit Working,I was very pleased when we first installed this gate. It has been up for only 4 months and the top part of the latch wont hold anymore. You can just push or pull it and it comes loose. There is a bottom catch that is still holding but it wont be long before my son is strong enough to push it open. (He has already figured out that the top doesnt hold) I will have to buy another gate in the next 6 months.
2,works but needs constant adjustment,"I got this gate for the top of our stairs. It fit well and by using the gate adapters, I didn't need the extensions at all. So measure carefully if you don't want to pay for more than you need. The gate works fine, but needs constant adjustment on the side screws to keep the gate closed properly. And we hardly ever have the gate closed, only when my daughter is allowed to roam the landing. I can't imagine how much worse it would be if we were opening and closing the gate constantly. The hands free gates are so much better. We use them constantly and so far have not required adjustment (unfortunately, they wouldn't work on the stairs) so I'd recommend them over this gate."
1,"Missing size between 49""-59""","The gate states it can fit between sizes 38-53"" and uses extensions. Unfortunately you open the gate and find it does not fit the gap between 49""-59"" with extensions which my measurement was 53"" leaving me high and dry. This was a common problem on some of the other baby gates / pet gates. Also the end pieces were missing the rubber stopper on 3 of the 4 ends and the frame was bent inwards so the door was having issues which was more of a shipping issue then the product itself."
1,Ugh!,Read all the customer reviews and decided that this was going to be an excellent gate. It probably is except that when received the gate it had no latch to keep gate closed! Would return it but it is so big and bulky! Plus the box came beaten up so badly that there is no way it would survive a return trip back. I usually trust amazon.com but the ball was dropped here! Truly disappointed!
5,Love it!,"I have several baby gates in my home. I have two older children and a baby that is out to encounter every danger he can find!!! I needed a gate to keep him out of the opening leading to the garage and laundry room. I bought this one after reading reviews from several makers. I think I picked this one because the majority of feedback was 4's and 5's. I too like this gate. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish there was a little bit bigger gap between at least one set of the bars. The reason is because my bold cat just leaps over it but my timid cat sits there forlorn. The laundry room is where the cat box and food is. If one of the slats was just slightly bigger the cats could squeeze through and yet provide maximum security for the baby! It fits my 48"" opening fantastically and it is very easy to use yet very secure! I would recommend this gate without hesitation!"
3,"Great Gate, Clear a Few Hours to Install","PositivesLooks GreatDoesn't Need to be MountedHard for Baby to Open, Easy for ParentsNegativesWith larger extensions, IMPOSSIBLE to installI got the 39"" extension for a rather large space I needed a gate in. I spent 2.5 hours trying to install it correctly, and the gate still does not latch. I think this needs to be a two-four person job where everyone can unscrew the sides at the same time, because if it is slightly off, it doesn't work.BUT, I am still happy I bought this gate (if I can get it to work). We got the black gates, and they look beautiful in our home and did not ruin our brick when installed."
5,Love it!,I read many reviews and finally selected this gate. I have 14 month old twins and needed a way to put one baby down while chasing another one. I have a 58 inch opening and I was worried because a previous review said that they need to do some modifications. I got the 170 with the extensions and then had to also purchase the 10.5 inch extender. The combo fit perfectly. I loved this gate so much that I bought another one and am planning on a third. One of the reviews mentioned pinching fingers. I don't know how a baby would pinch their fingers. The gate is super easy to setup once you know how to do it. I would highly recommend this gate.
4,Good gate,Good gate. Sturdy and well built. Purchased this gate about a month ago and have not had any issues thus far.
5,super gate,After researching and trying other brands i have to say this one is the best. Although not cheap...(we need 5 gates in our house) it is well worth the money. It is very sturdy and easy to use opening and closing mechanism. I absolutely love these gates.
3,Okay,"The gate works as described. I prefer the Safety First Hands Free gate that I have in another area of the house, but it isn't long enough for the space we bought this gate for. Guests can never figure out how to open it (the lifting part isn't intuitive). I don't like that it automatically closes. Some people probably like that in a baby gate, but I like being able to leave it open when the baby isn't around.On the positive side, the gate is very secure and attractive."
2,Not very childproof,"I run a small home child care, and every child who is able to stand is also able to open this gate. The gate can become a hazard if it is unlatched by a child and then leaned upon by another, causing the child to fall.I climb over it most of the time!"
3,Worked great at first,"We absolutely loved this gate at first. It really latched well and was easy for us to open and close. We've had it for about 3 years but now we need to replace it. It has completely lost it's grip. It no longer stays put. It slides off of the wall. Also it does not latch anymore. My 17 month old is able to open the gate by shaking it. She shakes it and the door pops right open. For the price you pay for this gate, I would've expected it to last a little longer."
3,"High quality, couldn't get it to fully adjust properly","This item appeared to be made very well. It fit the space perfect and the door automatically closed and latched. The one issue is that the top latch never properly aligned and locked. Pressure mounted gates require you to tighten the gate in order for the door to line up and appear off before pressure is applied (this wasn't the first pressure gate I've installed). This one did partially lock but the top latch never aligned to fully lock, so I wasn't comfortable leaving the gate in place. The item has since been returned to Amazon and I'm not sure whether to try another or not. I do prefer the The First Years Hands Free Gate instead but will have to purchase extensions in order to use this. I also like the fact that the First Years gate doesn't automatically close the door in case I want to leave the area opened (I'll probably change my tune on this when my daughter is older)."
2,Great if you like glitter on everything!,The dress has loose glitter detailing that gets on everything! It's always on my daughter's face and got in her eye. Terrible and cheap. Find some sparkle fabric mattel.
1,Lock to keep bike safe from grandma,"Seriously, this lock won't stop a person and a pair of pliers... I'd give your bike no more than 10 seconds. On the other hand it might slow your kid brother from borrowing it. Zero stars, buy a real lock."
5,Delta Bound,"I was happily led to this CD by a review in The New York Times (12/31/2007, Ben Ratliff). Evan Christopher ranks with Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw as an artist who has created his own sound with the clarinet. His original compositions on this recording merge perfectly with the more traditional pieces, each of which is presented in a fresh way. I agree with the late Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records, that Mr. Christopher is ""the best clarinetist in the world"" today (2005 Montreaux Jazz Festival)."
3,good but not great,"these weights don't hold too tight on my wrist, but overall they do their job well enough."
2,Doesn't fit '99 Forester,"Although this site says the seal fits the '99 Forester, it is in fact too large. This is the outside seal, the two inner ones I ordered did fit. I've returned the item."
1,Defective,"I ordered this CD for my husband for Christmas. It could not be played past the fifth track because of a defect on the disc. Amazon kindly replaced it, but the second disc had the same defect. We returned the second disc also and got a refund."
1,Incredibly lame.....,"This song may be incredibly popular amongst some people, for example it has had something like 21 million views on youtube and tons of radio airplay. For the life of me I can't understand why, this song practically defines the term Emo with some of the most self-absorbed lyrics I think I've ever heard, even the likes of Cat Stevens and Peter Frampton sound profound by comparison."
3,CD Purchase Bleep Bleep Bleep,"I purchased the cd ""Hey There Delilah"" by The Plain White Ts. It was shipped to me quickly. The transaction was flawless. When I went to play the CD, I found that some of the words were bleeped out. I think this is a great thing when purchasing music that will be played around children. I have no young children and am not happy with the fact that my cd sounds like it is skipping because words are bleeped out. I would not have purchased this cd if I knew it would be like that.Thank YouBsandij"
2,great song but extra tracks were defective on CD,"Great song but extra tracks were not working:Amazon sent me a defective CD, but I decided that it's not worth while the effort for the extra tracks to get the CD exchanged.Amazon should visually inspect CD's before shipment and if there's a big scratch already visible on the back of the CD then they should replace or test the CD before packing."
5,This is a great song!,Hey There Delilah is a great song. That is probably why it's popular. duh.All thses people saying it's for the easily manipulatedOr they instantly dislike people who like this song.My god where did you loose your soul. I can see you pouting therelike your sucking on some lemon.This is one of the nicest songs I've heard in ages. Liked by nice people.
1,unsatisfied with quality of the cd,"i couldnt even play the last two songs on the cd, the quality is poor and im very unsatisfied, i wouldnt recommend anyone buy this product."
2,not as good as we hoped,It did not hold up although it was less messy initially than caulk in a tube. The bottom line is if it will do the job intended and it did not.
1,This stuff is no good,"After recaulking our tub we thought as an extra measure of protection we would use this caulk strip. Do not waste your money on this product. It does NOT have adhesiveness when wet. It looked great when first applied but after two showers it partly seperated from the wall. When we went to remove it, it pulled the caulk right out. A good part of the caulk job had to be completely redone. This stuff is garbage. Improved adhesion? I don't think so. We should have just left it alone with just redoing the caulking. Do a good job caulking your tub and leave it at that, do not use this product."
5,Murder Two,"A great book with many stories, as well as explinations of meanings and how they work (blood spatter.) It's a very fast and easy read, it kept me very interested because I didn't feel like I was ever ""stuck"" on one story. I can't wait to get the first book now!"
4,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"This is a fun new twist on the classic style of trivia games. Teams constantly shift and switch throughout the game, so you'll never be stuck with the worst player or forced to play against the trivia hound for long. The different categories and question styles keep it interesting and, while the rules take a bit longer to learn than those of Trivial Pursuit, it's very much worth it. It's particularly nice in that no one is stuck waiting for someone else to take their turn for very long; since the teams are constantly switching, any given player spends the majority of the game actually playing instead of waiting."
3,Party Disapointment,"After reading the description on the box, my husband and I told all of our gaming friends about it and we were very anxious to try it out. We played a full game once and since then it has been relagated to the ""read some cards and see who can shout out the answer"" pile of games that only appears after many drinks and other entertainment options are winding down. The rules are very complex, and I think most of us hoped for more ability for ""backstabbing"" and more challenging questions."
5,This game was a hit with our family,Our family played three games the very first night we opened up the box. We really enjoyed the variety with the five trivia games and with the teams changing each round. It made for some very interesting play and strategies. We found playing in these teams to be more enjoyable and interactive than other trivia games we have played. The game also has great trivia questions!
5,Poised to Strike,"Let's forgo the atomic fuzz-cloth shag carpets, unframed White Snake posters, and bottle-cap coffee tables for good. In fact, we'll leave behind the tasteless TV dinner stands and hypocritical, drapeless windowpanes, too, and give ourselves up to the ineluctable Gods of Modernity for once in our lives. I speak to all man. Never before has such a gloriously impish mind expressed its inner design so bloody well (and with such economy!). Michael Payne's first book is an astonishing array of decorating dilemnas, and to read it is to experience not just the utter re-imagination of the American household, but also the unraveling of a distinct conscienceness of style. Where do we live in the 21st century? In our minds and in our homes, and Payne hits the bullseye with this masterful take on the way we want to live, and the way we want to inhabit our most precious surroundings."
4,Let's Ask Michael : 100 Practical Solutions for Interior Design,Michael Payne is one of the many wonderful and helpful Interior Designers that HGTV had on their Decorator staff. He wrote a book for all of us homemakers to study and figure out what makes good design when it comes to furnishing your home. AMAZON never lets me down when it comes to instructive booksl for the home decorator.
2,Not Impressed,"I was very dissapointed with this book. It had a few good decorating ideas. I love Michael's show and rarely miss and episode but I thought this book was not up to snuff. After going through the book and looking at all of the pictures carefully, I noticed that most of the before and afters were directly from his show. Considering the price tag of the book, I would recommend to just keep watching his show. Definitely not worth the money."
3,WIsh it had more examples,"I love to watch Michael Payne on ""Designing for the Sexes"" so I looked forward to reading this book. I was a bit disappointed in the format in that I had a pretty good idea of what Michael's responses to e-mails would be from watching his show. There was some useful advice but the book would benefit from more visual examples. Budget concerns were hardly addressed so it's hard to know how practical some of the answers would be to the average homeowner. It's a light and enjoyable read and might offer readers a bit of inspiration, but the book doesn't serve as a how-to for serious remodelers."
2,Disappointed,"Having lived in Montana for a number of years, I was expecting a made in Montana product. The description states Montana salad bowl and the bowl is stamped on bottom with Mountain Woods logo but also had a made in Viet Nam sticker on the bottom. PLUS, there was a flawed seam where two pieces of wood joined, not flush and obvioiusly not smoothly finished at this joint. The bowl is very pretty and beautifully finished otherwise. Feel it is falsely represented as a Made in Montana by MountainWoods in North Glacier, MT"
2,this wont keep you dry or warm,these coveralls are supposed to keep you warm and dry when riding a motorcycle. they do neither. they do not keep you warm and you will be soaking wet if you wear them in the rain while riding.
2,"Snow, ski, and rescue suit","I bought a pair of these coveralls and have found that they are very poor quality. they have excess material in the pockets, they have no back pocket for your wallet. I also found out that the hood is not made to fit the head properly. The manufacturer did not make them very well.. II would not recommend these to anyone"
2,Not impressed,This suit is very disappointing. It doesn't have much insulation so is not very warm. The crotch is too low but not too bad after the belt is hooked. The hook on the belt twists because the belt is not adjustable. Other than that it is usable.
4,nice looking,"I got the insulated suit mainly for fishing in the cold windy river. I wear large and I ordered large. It fits fine over my jeans and shirt. However, I have not had chance to try it outdoors, as it has been too warm!"
1,"Not Waterproof, Not Warm Enough","I expected this to be waterproof and a lot warmer, so I have been very disappointed in it. I got soaked through every layer wearing it in rain, and it isn't as warm as I need for riding a motorcycle on a 40 degree day. I can't imagine riding a snowmobile is dryer than riding a motorcycle, and snowmobiling would be in even colder temperatures! It's not adequate at all for my needs.Very disappointing."
3,Its Ok,"The suit looks great lots of room, the only thing missing is I feel the pocket should have zipper but so far the suit performs ok with zero problems"
4,"No snow yet in Michigan to try out this insulated suit, but it fits great!","I haven't had the opportunity yet to try this insulated suit in the outdoor elements here in Michigan; no snow yet and here it is almost the middle of January! (very unusual) However, I did try the insulated suit on after it was delivered and it fits great! I stand 5'6"", 175 lbs. and purchased the LARGE. I don't think any other size for my height and weight would have been better. I can only give it a 4 star rating because it fits and feels great, but haven't been able to test it in any adverse winter weather. It feels like it would hold up to a 5 star rating in the cold winter months, but only time will tell."
1,I was COLD!,"I bought this for a ski trip last weekend and was not pleased. I was cold the entire weekend... even with long underwear, t-shirt, sweatshirt, and scarf. Also, when I sat on the ski lift I ended up with snow melting and my sweat pants getting wet. I was not happy at all. I expected this to be water resistant and to keep me warm."
3,Can't beat it for the price... but,"The sleeves do not have a velcro or cord to tighten against the wind, and the elastic cuff inside does not seal against a 60+mph commute on my motorcycle. Still it keeps my chest and legs warm enough, an overkill in Central Florida, but when it is below 45 in the morning, I enjoy the warmth of this suit."
5,Great buy,"I bought this for my all year Harley riding, I have two and have only tested on one. We've had lots of rain down here. Anyway back to the suit I got it last Friday night and couldn't wait to use it rain was coming in so I put the suit on sweatshirt,jeans,and boots. OH ya my glow in the dark skull mask temp was 36 deg w/10-15 mph wind. I rode for about an hour (we have alot of deer here so I limit my night rides.) But the suit worked great,no air seeping, never got cold at all seem to be very wind resistant. The one thing I wish it had was a velcro hook-up on the neck then I wouldn't have to use a baklava. We've got colder weather coming in so I'm looking forward to more testing.I've told some of the other guys I ride with so maybe you'll get a spike in sales."
3,wind in the legs,Black Snow Ski & Rescue Insulated SuitThis is a great snow suit compared to the price. It is warn except for the leg part. Air does come up the open leg because it is not tight around the bottom.Over wise it is a great suit.
2,Too big and not shaped for a woman,"I thought this suit was good for the price, but once I received it, I realized why. I am a woman and the suit was probably made for a man! The suit had no shape at all, therefore, I didn't even return it in order to try the smaller size. Not good for a woman, but would probably work perfectly for a man."
1,Not recommended!!!,"Just received this yesterday and tried it on.On initial inspection, I noticed that the legs seemed odd.Upon trying it on, I noticed that the crotch on this suit is located @ my knees!?I'd have to have an inseam of @ 24"" long to fit this suit! I look so ridiculous wearing it with my body appearing to be 3~4 times longer than my legs!Look to me like this was made a size small by cutting off the legs on a size medium or a large suit!Sitting down, the legs ride up high above my ankles for a fashionable ""high water"" look that's trendy in China???And the crotch area is half way down to my knees and makes it difficult to sit comfortably on a couch.This was bought to be used for riding a motorcycle with my husband and I CAN NOT see me wearing it on a bike!To be able to ride and sit comfortably, I'll need to pull up the legs so that I can straddle the seat, which makes the legs go up higher for ""deeper high water"" look that go up 1/2 way between my ankles and my knees!"
3,Not impressed,Wasn't as heavy as I hoped it would be for a Ski & Rescue Suit.Also would have been better if zipper went all the way up leg.
4,More good Uncle Scrooge stories,"This comic includes two long Uncle Scrooge stories with a one page short at the end and another one page short in the middle. In the first story Uncle Scrooge purchases the world's only supply of bombastium at an auction. While his scientists search for a use for the substance, Scrooge and his nephews rush off to Antarctica to put the Bombastium in guaranteed safe keeping, since the substance will evaporate if not constantly kept frozen. While on their journey, Scrooge and his nephews are pursued by sinister agents from the country of Brutopia, who want the Bombastium too. The second story is about Scrooge and his nephews trying to get a large payment of gold back from Bantu while trying to avoid the pursuing Beagle Boys. If you like any of the Disney ducks or Disney comics, you should enjoy this one."
1,Surprise ending,"The end of this movie is a total surprise. To me anyway. There was no way I could watch this movie through.If you feel you must see this movie save some moeny and rent NOT buy or better yet when you see it just go ""BYE"""
2,Immoral Stories,"This is a film involving three stories about three women over three different periods in history.The first, with Marina Pierro is set in the Renaissance in Rome where she is the baker's daughter who sleeps with an artist. She double-crosses men in order to rake in some of the money that's flowing into the Papal coffers.The second story is about a girl who has an un-natural relationship with her rabbit, and then looses her virginity to a black man as he has her pressed up against a number of sheep in a pen in a slaughter-house. Not very tasteful.The third story hints at a woman having a close relationship with a dog that protects her from a number of men. Also distasteful."
1,Another Very Disappointed Customer,"The book is awful. The color pictures are awful; so much for professional photography. Poorly-written text. ""I have to wonder if the author and his partner have set the prices to reflect their current inventory as they are also dealers of Stangl & Fulper potteries,"" said it best. Don't waste your money on this or any other Runge book that may be promoted. In it for themselves."
4,Loved it!,Diana Palmer is always a good read. I like the fact that I always know that regardless of what happens in the story the girl always gets her guy!
2,Is this even Diana Palmer?,"I was so excited to get this trilogy. To say I was disappointed is a gross understatement. I've heard that sometime publishers will publish books written by other authors under a well-known writer's name to generate sales. After reading this lastest effort by Ms. Palmer, I believe it may be true. Where are the rough, arrogant, hard-as-nails, angst-ridden, passionate cowboys I've come to expect from the Long, Tall Texan series?? When those guys fell, they fought tooth and nail, and they fell hard. There was no passion, which is very untypical of Diana Palmer, no depth to the stories, and the character development was weak. If I truly believed Ms. Palmer wrote this trilogy, I would never say these things because she really is a fabulous writer and the only one whom I will even read in the genre.Ms. Palmer, if you did write these stories, and the change is so dramatic because someone told you this is what women want in men these days, don't believe it. I want the men back"
4,Good Stories,Good stories. All interlinked or have returing characters from other stories. Lets you know what is going on from one story to the other.
2,Good but not Diana Palmer's best.,Each story in Long Tall Texan Summer was a little too short to reach the full potential that Ms. Palmer usually reaches. The romantic tension between the characters barely starts before it is over. Most Diana Palmer's novels are fantastic but I would reccomend passing on this book and choosing another by her.
2,Diana Palmer....not her best writing,I was disappointed with these books. They were cut and left no room to grow the characters and plots. This is the one Diana Palmer book that I would not recommend to others
5,tie in of long tall texan series,a book of 3 stories relating to jacobsvillea great read for any diana fan!
4,Small Book,"Very nice inspiring book with interesting pictures and quotes, but also very short. Bought it as a bargain book for under $5. Good deal."
2,Not A Enjoyable Book..,"I do not recomen anybody to read this book. It is hooribale. There is nothing realy to this book at all. It's boring. Thats all. I do have to say that Tim McGraw is a Tariffic singer, and thats what he should stick with.If you liked this book, then check out all of Tim McGraw's Cds"
4,"Great Gift, CD Not So Great",This book was a great gift for several important people in my life. I was a little disappointed to find that the song was different than what you hear on the radio. It's not as dramatic as the radio version. I still listen to my copy quite a bit and the people I gave them to like them as well.
5,Live Like You Were Dying,I found this book to be touching and inspirational. It was well written and nicely presented. It impressed me so much that I bought extra copies to pass along to my daughter and 2 of my best friends. The CD that was included was and added bonus.
1,Poor Memorial,"The audio quality of this CD is very poor. It sounds like it derived from a pirated taping of a Burl Ives college sing along. While the audience participation is clearly recorded, Mr. Ives singing and guitar playing are mushy and seem to be the results of poor microphone placement. The only redeeming factors are the unavailability of some of this material on other Ives collections and the ability to hear Mr. Ives work an audience. Buy this only if you are a Burl Ives groupee and simply must have anything ever done by Mr. Ives. Even as a Burl Ives fan, I am constantly tempted to simply discard this disc."
2,"It was ""OK"" but only for cricket lovers","""Rain men"" is an book about Marcus Berkmann's terrible village cricket team. Although some witty humour this book is quite dull with a simple storyline and only focusing on cricket all the time!.I think Marcus Berkmann is a very comical writer and has potential but sorry this book wasn't quite good enough"
5,An excellent history of mountain people!,Hillbilly: The Real Story (The History Channel)I bought it because I wish to understand how my family got from Northumberland in England to the United States and the history since that time of the Applachian people. I know2 a lot more now having watched the DVD.
3,Skips the Civil War?,"I could have missed it, but I believe this documentary skips over the Civil War entirely. Could it be perhaps because the C.S.A. lost? I find it pretty insulting that the secession of the southern states was left out of this otherwise interesting and enlightening documentary."
4,Informative documentory from amazon.com,This is a good video for the whole family to watch together. It is not only informative but also very entertaining.
4,fairly entertaining,They didn't do too bad with the stereotyping but it is just that kind of movie so you have to accept it.
4,Good book for children going through divorce,"My divorce lawyer recommended this book to me after I expressed concern about how my kids might be handling my divorce. To be honest, it struck me as somewhat childish, but both of my sons took to it and claimed that it made them understand what was happening... and that it made them feel better to know they were not the only ones who've experienced this. And that was good enough for me!"
4,Good starting place,This is a good book for starting the discussion of divorce. Some of the pages can be confusing for kids or can be an opportunity to open discussion. Specifically the page showing the MOther Dino drinking with spilled meds on the table behind her....
2,Dinosaurs Drinking??,"I was appalled when I turned the page and saw a picture of the 'mom' dinosaur drinking a martini with wine and liquor bottles on the table behind her, along with a bottle of pills spilled open! I just don't think that was appropriate for children.In addition, I think the book should have been geared to DIVORCE and not dating and getting remarried. Those topics should have been addressed in a separate book. It is hard enough helping a child cope with divorce, let alone adding new step parents and step siblings in the mix much too prematurely.Still searching for a good book for children on divorce. I was very dissapointed in this."
1,Awful awful book why would you read this to a child?,"Seriously, this book has depictions of ex wives pounding back martinis and empty pill bottles, ir depicts new girlfriends as a witch, why in the world would someone think this is good material for a child of ANY age. Common sense here people."
4,If you're ready...,this is the book for you to use with your child(ren). Thorough and thoughtful. Great book.
2,Dated and biased,"I found this book disappointing and dated. The usual info about anger, displacement,etc was portrayed, but most of the images were biased toward the Mommy displaying the negitive aspects of what the child may incounter. It was published around 1984, and I think its time for a new, more modern vision of divorce."
1,absolutely inappropriate!,"As a teacher and child from a divorce, I found this to be a horrible book. It put resposibility on the child for dealing with their parents inappropriate behaviors."
2,Dinosaurs divorce,"I think this might be a good book for people with contentious divorces. Mine is very amicable and a lot of the pages/pictures are not applicable to our situation and therefore somewhat confusing to my son. After reading it a couple of times to him, I chose not to read it to him anymore as it wasn't helpful. He also didn't like the book so much. However, he loved ""Two Homes to Live In"", which is a book that is out of print but you can still find some copies out there."
4,Helpful resource,I am a social worker in private practice and I have read this book to many of my clients. It covers important issues/topics related to divorce and normalizes feelings. It is a non-threatening tool to help children begin to discuss the divorce.Other helpful books for mental health professionals working with children of divorce include:Creative Interventions for Children of DivorceWas It the Chocolate Pudding?: A Story For Little Kids About DivorceWhere am I Sleeping Tonight? (A Story of Divorce)
1,Horrible book with negative spin,"In trying to explain divorce, I read this to my son and paraphrased what the book said because I found myself surprised at the way it was written (especially since it was written by Arthur's creator, Marc Brown.) The book is negative in tone, language and illustrations. I'm not a parent trying to candy-coat divorce, but there have to be better books out there than this!Check it out in a bookstore first (B&N; allows you to order and look at the book in store before purchasing) so see if it is something you would feel comfortable reading to your own child.As for me, this book is going in the recycle box; too negative for my home and family."
2,"Suffering through a Bitter, Divisive Divorce?","If you are suffering through a bitter, divisive divorce with children involved this book may be appropriate for you. It mainly tried to put parents' bad behavior in context for children via simple explanations and photos. This book could be therapeutic for both parents and children going through this kind of experience, however I wouldn't recommend it for people going through an amicable divorce.I bought it on the advice of a therapist who immediately apologized for recommending it after I brought the book to her. My children would only have become more upset and had larger, more confusing questions had they read this book as my divorce is amicable and there has been no fighting, angry words exchanged in front of children, or inappropriate comments made from parents to children. So, chose wisely. This book is well written and has its place. Match your experience and needs carefully before buying is my advice."
1,Where's the chord?,I am not sure if the product works as it did not come with a power chord or user manual. This was a Christmas gift that is now useless! I have ordered these items directly from the manufacturer at an additional cost of $40.00! I will never do this again!!!
3,good performance but overpriced and huge,"it does outperform most of the competition but in this age of smaller better cheaper it's a big expensive dinosaur.It's huge and very conspicuous no matter where you mount it. I'm sorry but the days of the $300+ radar detectors are passed, especially one the size of a brick"
2,Not worth the money.,Took it on a 700 mile road trip and doesn't work any better than my $40 Whistler. Range is average at best. Disappointed.
3,Great until out of Warranty,"Its a great detector for sure and I like the progamability, but sure enough 16 months it displayed the service warning and no longer works. It almost seems like its programed to go home after a certain amount of time kind of like E.T. I dont know if I am going to fix it or get something else. I had the valentine one but it bugged the crap out of me with the false x band warnings. I guess $60 bucks isnt too bad for a repair but it should last longer than this. On the bright side it did pay for itself finding those traps. 3 stars for reliability / quality issues."
1,Defective & overpriced,"I got a 8500 x50 blue in 2006. First one was defective.... it kept showing ""Service Required"" messages. The replacement just died in July 2008 -- it won't turn on. It seems to have this trouble on/off for some time but a simple unplug/plug would fix it. Not this time. I read it seems 2006 was a bad year for Escort. My prior Bel's were just as good and lasted many years.Also the clip for visor it too tight and the rear sensor is blocked by the cushion visor"
1,Borrow one before you buy.,Escort X50 is plagued by false alarms on the Laser and Pop channels. Please borrow a friends and test in your car first. I have tested in 4 different cars and everything from the horn to the turbo charging spooling up will cause this thing to go wild. I tried working with Escort to resolve problem but they wanted 65 dollars to place foil over the sensor to (Dumb down my detector). I've already given to much money to escort.
4,So far so good,Have not found the unit to be any better or worse than any other detector that I have owned. It works but still produces as many false alarms as the last Radio Shack unit I had for half the money.
4,Excellent Radar Protection,"I have had this radar detector for two years and it saved me at least 5 or 6 tickets. I would give it a 5 star rating except for the constant difficulty I have in keeping it mounted on my windshield, especially in cold weather."
1,"Good detector, but bad quality","I bought my X50 Blue a couple years ago and it worked fine for about a year. Then the ""self cal"" alarm kept going off. Finally, it got to the point where it said ""service required"". I called Escort and it was of course out of warranty. They did however tell me that for $60.00 that they would repair it. I sent it in and it worked for about 6 months. Now it falses saying ""laser"" constantly. The first time, the service report said it had a bad antenna. Now, who knows what is wrong. In short, I wish I would have spent a little more and bought the valentine 1 and not had these problems. Escort has obviously saved money by buying sub par components that don't last. My detector has never been dropped or abused and still looks brand new. I strongly advise anyone considering this detector to look elsewhere. If you already bought one, keep in mind that you can call Escort and get it repaired for $60.00."
1,Buy Extended Warrantee,"This thing will do a self diagnostic - fail it - and leave you mailing it back every 14 mos or so at fifty bucks a pop. ""you get what you pay for"" does not apply to this piece of crap."
1,Terrible customer service,"BUYER BEWARE! DONT BUY FROM ESCORT DIRECTLY!This company has the most arrogant and rude customer service i have ever experienced.This alone was so bad i am returning their product. Stay far far away.the problem seems widespread in the company, i spoke to many reps and they all basically called me a liar.i placed a order and was promised free overnight shipping. yet i was charged $10.00They completely refuse to credit it. They keep saying we NEVER give free overnight shipping.They just say return the unit or pay the $10. Well the unit is going back"
3,Good distance performance but poor filtering,"The Escort 8500 performs very well picking up distant signals, but does not filter out K band alarm systems in the City at all. I had a less expensive Whistler Pro 78 SE before that was stolen from my car. I decided to move ""up"" to the Escort, but the Whistler filtered false detects in the city MUCH better. I have not had as much experience with the Escort on the highway (which is the main reason I have a detector)... so I will have to update this review some time later."
3,This will help,"This unit wil tell me of every local cop or county in my area but will not help at all with State police. If you are 5-10 or so over and get a reading and slow quickly no problem, however fast erby the time it goes off your to late and will be caught. State Police forget about it, I've had them shootig the radar gun out the window as I drove by and didn't even get a beep.It might save a few local tickets and that could pay for itself."
1,Escort Customer Service Sucks,After having this unit for 5 years the volume control nob got too hot in the sun and melted. I called Escort and they said they can't sell me just that part for replacement. They said I had to pay $59 to get it fix from them. To pay $59 to get a $3 control nob fix is a crazy price to pay. Stay away from all the Escort radar. Valentine 1 is my next purchase.
5,Great product,"Works great. Has already saved me from a ticket in the first two days. Great range, especially over my previous unit. Very few false signals."
5,Has never failed me yet,"We now own two of these Escort Passports and think they are excellent. I know for a fact this unit is worth the money. A friend was driving next to me on a toll road, no cars around so our speed increased. My Escort began to show a weak Ka signal. I slowed down but my friend, who had a Whistler, kept accelerating. Then my signal peaked out. I couldn't see any police car and my friend was way ahead of me now. Suddenly, he slammed on his brakes at the top of an overpass and there was the State Trooper - sitting in the on ramp, well hidden. My Escort saw him 3-4 miles ahead...amazing!"
4,Passport 8500 X50,"My first time radar detecor purchase/user. Did a lot of research on theweb and the 8500 X50 was highly recomended above most others. Since I amnew to using detectors, I can not compare it to any others. The unit doesalert me of a radar in the area. The range of detection varies greatly.Sometimes it will warn me over a mile away and other times it goes offjust as soon as I spot them. I drive 80 miles one way to work and haveabout 3000 miles of testing with no tickets."
3,To many false alarms,For the money i expected more. To many false alarms no way to update the software on the detector. I didnt care for it at all i sent it back!
3,LOUD AND STARTS MALFUNCTIONING...,"THIS RADAR WORKED QUITE WELL THE FIRST YEAR WE HAD IT, BUT THEN IT STARTED TO CHANGE ON US.BEEPS FOR NO REASON, AND IT IS NOT EVEN THE DETECTOR DOING IT'S THING, IT SIMPLY MALFUNCTIONS.THE BUTTON ON THE POWER CONNECTOR STOPPED WORKING, SO WE HAD TO HOLD IT DOWN WITH A TAPE. SO SAD."
3,PASSPORT 8500 X50,Yeah the thing worked great for about a year and now the laser tone goes off every five minutes or so and it is instant on and loud. Needless to say it is very annoying and made the detector unusable. I have always been a fan of escort but like others say for 3 bills it puts a sour taste in my mouth.
1,Find another detector,"SERVICE WARNINGS again.... Anotyher $70 for the factory to reset the warning. This happens every year & this is no longer acceptable to me. I've read all the reviews & post from Passport, all saying that the heat will damage these...Duh ...and the post about leaving this powered up when starting the vehicle causes all kinds of voltage fluctuations that can harm it.Look I pay this kind of money I want a product that is trouble free and I dont have to keep paying Passport for service. I have never seen or heard of this about any other Detector. I will say the last time I sent this back for service they replaced the outer cover, which is nice.I'm just tired of this happening almost every year. Im sure there could be a way for them to allow us to reset this our selves. Its worse than the BMW service warnings but you can code around them."
3,Purchase of Item,"Seller advertised this item as NEW. When received, the item was USED. Contacted seller and he stated it was NEW but not Brand New. Amazon should closely monitor Sellers better. This is a seller working out of his basement of his house. I will investigate the Seller of advertised items from Amazon before ever purchasing again."
1,Won't last,"Well after a year or so, especially if it's exposed to any kind of heat, the capacitors wear out and you're gonna start to get a slew of ""false laser"" alerts. The customer service folks will politely explain that you can send it back for $60 and hope they will fix it ... :-("
4,Good product,I have been using the same model for the few years now and very happy with the product. Very reliable and saved me a lot of money. Just bought another one for my spouse and it works as good as the old one.
4,Escort Passport 8500 x 50,This is my second Escort Passport. I have used many other brands and wish I cough up the extra $ long ago. I did like the Passport 8500x 50 blue better. (So did the thief)
5,Very satisfied,I am not an expert on the topic of Radar Detectors. This unit was recommended to me. I looked at the reviews and was glad to see how highly rated it was. I am satisfied with it's performance and recommend it.
4,Radar,Escort Passport 8500 X50 Radar and Laser Detector (Blue Display)Very pleased with product. Easy to operate and Works extremely well. Would highly recommend.
2,Not what I expected,Did not keep it because its sound volume is too low. Not impressed about it accuracy and sensitivity. this is not what I expected. It does not work in Europe because different radio frequencies are in use. The vendor had difficulties tracing the receipt of my returned package. Luckely I had all the evidence from the UPS.
1,BAD QUALITY,"I buy this detector 3 or 4 years ago. it's only works fine in frist year; i put it on windshield. every summer, it'll display ""manufacture recall"" and not working when the weather going to hot. i sent it back to manufacture for repairing this problem 2 times, but there still has this problem in summer time. by the way,i have some friends order very cheaper detector ($40-50 bucks); it works fine in the whole season. ""Escort Passport 8500 X50 Radar and Laser Detector "" just has a good brand name. it's not cost the value.the cheaper radar detector is used same technology. maybe same chip insude."
2,Hardly works,This would never pick up any K band. Never picked up cops. And i just got pulled over doing 122 and the thing never went off. WTF.
1,Just follow the speed limit,If everyone who bought this would jut follow the speed limit they could save a ton of money. Stop using this to drive irresponsibly. I you get caught use pay the fine.
3,Poor quality control vs. planned obsolence,"I own three Escort X-50s and one of the Betronics RX-65 series detectors. These are both excellent radar detectors when they are working. I favor the Escort for having fewer false alarms but both have nice features and excellent range. However, all three of my Escort X-50's have been back for repair at least once and two have been back at least twice for service. I sent them in for service because the message on the detector screen said,""Service Required"". The odd thing is that there seems to be a pattern in this ""service required"" message; it seems that it appears apx every 18 or so months; and that would be to the tune of $59.95 a pop. My Beltronics is less than a month old and already being shipped back to the manufacturer for service. Since Bel and Escort are now one in the same company I am concerned that a less competitive market has meant less attention to producing a reliable product."
5,Well worth the money,"First off, I never write reviews, but felt compelled to write one because I am so satisfied with my purchase.I was a little bit hesitant to buy this at first because it seemed so pricey, but with my last ticket costing me over $200, I figured it would pay for itself fairly quickly. Boy, was I right. This has saved me from many tickets, and is extremely easy to use right out of the box. Again, its a little pricey for this model, but you MUST think of it more along the lines of an ""investment"" that will pay for itself.To some, it might seem stupid to get a blue one, when the red is $40 cheaper, but I am very happy with the blue one. This has to be one of the best purchases i've made."
4,Good but use common sense with it,I've owned this detector for over a year now and find it very good on the highway as it detects most police who use radar very far away. It gives me a warning in advance of at least 10 seconds which is plenty of time to slow down. However you must use it with caution as it is not as good on smaller roads with not too much open straight roads. This is not the radar detectors fault as suburban roads with many twists don't allow the radar to travel far enough for the detector to detect it. On the highway it works very well but you still must use common sense as on the highway it cannot protect you against undercover cruising next to you or laser that is directly aimed at you and you do not have enough time to slow down. Hope my review helped.
5,Awesome,"No tickets since getting the escort. I drive a lot of highway miles and the sensitivity, range on this radar detector is impressive. No gripes here! It isn't meant to be a laser detector, so watch out for speeding within large cities that use laser."
1,IMPORTANT!!!! Don't buy from Accessory Genie,"Accessory Genie is listed on Escort's website as an Unauthorized Reseller of this product and you will, therefore, have no warranty through Escort for this product (8500 X50). See for yourself on Escort's website."
1,Escort passport 8500 X50 Radar Detector,"This product was advertised as new, when I received this item it was not complete. The unit was shipped in an envolpe with a small amount of bubble wrap. There was no power cord,cup or case. I requested a refund and have not heard from this individual. He did state that he listed the missing items in the comments section. My question to him was it new or an open unit. I do not check the comments for missing part on a new item. This buyer should be ban from your site for false advertisment. I would never purchase an item from bestbuys again."
2,"Not the x50 version, good shipping, condition was not good","The item was not the correct version, the condition was listed as good, when the item has several scratches, and does not work in any heat above room temp. After the seven day return period, the seller stopped responding to my emails. Would not recommend seller. The best thing was the on-time delivery."
4,Escort 8500 x50 Radar Detector,"Excellent Radar detector for the money. Gives you ample lead time before seeing any cop car. Very few false warnings, mostly from bigger shopping centers. Definitely a worthy unit."
2,Unreliable and faulty,"I bought this radar detector unit one year back. It worked fine for first few months as it picked up LASER, POP, and Ka bands properly. However, after 6 months, it started displaying a message: ""Self Calibrating"" and finally displayed: ""Service Required."" After that this unit was unreliable. I passed several cop cars with LASER gun pointed on the highway. This unit never alerted me (POP is turned on). After several of such incidents, I returned the unit for servicing. The unit came back with a note saying that they replaced antenna and updated the software.Be sure to send the unit back if it displays ""Service Required"" message. If you ignore it, like I did, you might be travelling with a dummy unit.Be sure to get extended warranty. These units does seem to have quality problems. Considering $300 I paid, I am giving it a ** rating because of the quality problems."
5,Excellent product,"I don't write many reviews but I felt this one was worth the time to invest. This product saved me from a ticket the day I received it! It is simple to use for those who do not want a highly technical configuration but also provides advanced features which can be changed if you desire. In short, if you are looking for a good solid reliable product, you can't go wrong with this one.I would definitely buy another one."
4,Best radar detector I have ever had,"Best radar detector I have ever had. That said--is there really a radar detector that can 100% protect you?I think not.The issue is that the detector never goes off because law enforcement in my area keep their radars off. They only trigger their radar when they can instantly get you. Then it is too late to slow down after this detector goes off. In some cases, though, it has saved me on the interstate and major roads.I think if you live in high traffic areas with other vehicles that speed, this detector works well.This detector did everything I expected except suction to the windshield. On hot days it will fall off--thus I deducted 1 star for lousy suction cups."
2,Didn't work at all. Was not impressed.,I purchased this for a good chunk of money and expected to get something half decent. I was driving right towards a Police car with the radar gun pointed my car more then one occasion and it never made a sound. Although!! It goes off every single time I go past the grocery store and the golf course! That is so helpful! NOT!. Worthless product!
2,After owning several...,"...I can say that they have all failed, most sooner than later. They all give me the ""service required'message, often accompanied by a false laser radar alarm, which is the most alarming to the user (pun intended). That's annoying when it's a false alarm.I do have to say, when it's working, I'm very, very pleased with its performance. It has saved me some tickets, I'm sure. I never used it to drive like a maniac, but just to keep me less likely to get a ticket when I'm not as consciously aware as I should be of the speed limit.I have to try another brand, after this, my fifth 8500, has failed. Some lasted a year, most did not."
3,If you have the money it's ok. Butt....,"I also own the Beltronics Vector 895 that works just as well or better. I cant believe I paid three bills for the Escort Passport 8500 x50. It does not even have voice over like my 895 has. Announcing the band and then sounding off. I should have just sent the Escort back. Also if your a little hard of hearing, The tones are not as sharp as the Beltronic 895. As far as the tests I read about, I do not find the Escort to be any better than what I was using, And I have owned 4 radar detectors in the last 3 years. Save your $$$ and go for the Beltronics Vector 895.."

1,I Fell Using This Bath Mat,"These mats are very large and have a great thick rubber feel. But the ""suction cups"" on these mats can be problematic. The second time I used my mat, I moved to turn around in the shower and instead of the ""suction cups"" gripping the tub and keeping the mat in place, the mat suddenly slid down toward the drain. The thick rubber surface of the mat kept my feet in place, so my feet slid with the mat. I tried to catch myself, but it happened so fast that I couldn't. I fell very hard and landed squarely on my rump in the tub. I was sore for 3 days following this incident, but otherwise I was okay. This was a frightful experience and the one good thing that came of it was that I got to stop my 83 year old Mother from using the mat I had purchased for her. My Mother is very frail and had she slipped on the mat and fallen as hard as I did, I have no doubt that she'd have fractured bones."
2,"Fall on your [...] with this stinky, curly bath mat","Here are my problems with this mat.1. The mat was packaged and curled so tightly it doesn't lay flat in the tub. Both ends of the mat try to curl up.2. The suction cups don't grip the tub hardly at all.3. The mat smells bad when it's wet. I hope this issue will improve after numerous uses.4. Water doesn't drain off of the mat well. For practical purposes, you'll need to pull the mat up and drape it over the tub so it can dry properly after use."
1,Does not work,"I tried and tried but could not get this bath mat to afix to the bottom of the tub. I followed the directions carefully, and even tried a few other things to get it to say. It would barely afix to the tub, and then come off during a bath, makeing it even slippier than if I had nothing. I don't know if it the non mildew and easy cleaning feature worked since we could never really never use it."
2,"Great Singer, Bad Song Selection","Of seven of Paul Robeson's CD's in my collection, this is the worst by far. In fact, it's the only one I don't like at all. I am comforted by the feeling that Paul Robeson did not make this selection."
5,"very nice price ,good quality , fast shiping ..","very good price for good tools, proof that you don't have to pay a lot to have good tools ,plus you get metric sizes and standard sizes ,love it .."
3,Needs better instructions,"Overall it of good quality. A few issues putting it together (the instructions aren't very good). The door bell installation isn't even mentioned in the instructions! Needless to say we still have problem with it. First it was so tight to press and actually get it to ring (impossible for our 4yo to do!) We decided to widen the hole just a bit with sand paper...BIG MISTAKE! Now if you press it it just keeps on ringing! The instruction booklet/pages tells you to be carufull unpacking...well is at the botton of the box and you find it after you've unpacked (we broke a couple of little pieces that hold the curtain rods, not a big deal."
3,Could have been so much better,"The lead characters, Dora and Zical, are really good, especially Dora, the computer made human. The story line is excellent. There are real mysteries, dangers, and frustrations. In many ways, I liked it better than The Challenge (the training by sexual frustration in that one bothered me). But this book repeated too much of the first one, especially in the sex scenes; I could have interchanged the names and noticed no difference. Also, the resolution came too swiftly for all that went before. Otherwise, this book might have surpassed its predecessor. Certainly Zical's despair over Dora's climactic action was superbly written; I cried for several pages. But it was all resolved too abruptly, so allow the proper emotional responses to occur in the reader or even in the characters. All the elements were there; they just weren't handled as well as they could have been, leaving this reader unsatisfied with the result."
3,Predictable but enjoyable,"A sentient computer named Dora, a secondary character from The Challenge, wants a body so she can make love with Zical, a hot-shot Ryastani warrior. The idea of a computer creating a fully-functioning body is well-thought out and intriguing and she is a rather endearing character. I found the love scenes repetitive of the first story - and rather one dimensional, a variation on the ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" theme. One thing about this entire plot line, though, that bothers me is this cultures reliance on shrink-to-fit suits that link to a person's psychic ability and provide - literally - everything the person needs. Nobody exists without wearing one, from birth to death and these suits provide an artificial manipulation of existence - rather like medication does today. When their suits don't operate and ""fall off"", they don't even know how to take a shower or use the toilet. I found the idea of a grown person needing to be toilet trained rather intrusive."
3,Sci-fi romance,"It's ok. As with all her books in this series, there is alot of character thoughts, not character dialogue. That can be alittle boring. I still recommend it."
1,!!!!! Choking Hazard !!!!,"We just received this Melissa & Doug Abacus for our baby. Upon taking out of it's package, the bottom three bars easily slipped out of the drilled holes. They slide out far too easily. The holes are drilled too deep for the other bars above too, which means it's only a matter of time & effort for those to come loose too.Sure it says it is for ages 3+ but if you have other younger children in the house, this is a choking hazard. The beads are just the right size to get lodged in the throat. Even if you just have ages 3yrs and up, no one wants beads and thin blunt metal sticks laying around. Please be aware!"
2,good technique info but the recipes are inaccurate,"I was excited about this book at first glance, with all the wonderful painting techniques and very simple easy to follow instructions. However, I've tried 2 projects following the paint recipes with precision and the color of the paint is not at all like it appears in the book. For instance, I tried to get the look of dry brushing with her ultramarine blue. The paint recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of ultramarine blue artists' acrylic paint and instead I had to use about 3 cups. I hoped my second project would be better but I eventually gave up after spending a fortune trying to add enough of the artists paint to get the right shade."
2,Acquired taste?,"I bought this CD because I'd heard Andreas Scholl sing Arirang and it was lovely; I wanted to see if there were similarly enchanting tunes to be found in other Korean music and got this CD because it has Arirang on it. But when I played it, I didn't even recognize the ""tune."" Or anything that my western ears could recognize as a tune, really. If you already like Korean music, then I have no idea how you'd feel about this example of it. It didn't do anything for me."
2,Unfinished,"I'm a huge fan of James Patterson but this one was disappointing. The plot was good and well developed as most of his books. I was interested and challenged throughout but it ended abruptly and with no ""aha"" moment. It was as if he just got tired of writing this one and wanted to finish it for a deadline. I think the ending was unfinished."
5,Very clear image,"I am happy with my product, it helps me with my smaller pictures. And it's light weight. It is also very easy to use."
4,Good beginner skates,"Good beginner skates, they are comfortable, true to fit, have good ankle support. I took off one star because the pair Amazon sent me did not match the picture online. I don't know if they have updated it yet but the picture online is for a pair of silver and black skates and the ones sent were a brown and black pair. If you don't care what color they are, then this is a good pair beginner / recreational skates."
3,Soft wheels.,"I bought these as a gift. The boot fits fine and performs well, but the wheels are soft. The wheels wore out very quickly and were also sluggish to skate on. Once the wheels were replaced (using the original bearings), the skates were a joy to skate on."
2,"Better than nothing, I guess","Been a Coreldraw user since v8. Used v9 for years - not a bad product. In fact I still use the screen capture from v9 as the X3 version is garbage. X3 has broke me from ever buying another Corel product. Poorly designed command structure and limited ability to customize. Corel also removed some features that were in v9. Basically hate using it and am contemplating re-saving ALL my documents back to v9 and reusing v9 until I upgrade to Adobe. It's a pain to do this as I have a lot of documents, but it's less painful than continuing to use X3. Have sent numerous emails to Corel about the bugs and the only help they offer is to re-install. Well, I'm tired of re-installing ... it's time to delete."
2,mickey mouse,"I've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in Corel Draw, the file was saved several times without error, the finished piece is 2.6 GB. I exported it as a PDF that is 4.5 GB. Never any errors in Corel Draw.Acrobat won't open the PDF. Says it's corrupted.Now when I open the CDR all I get is a single page, and when I right click on the file and look at the properties it says it's 0 pages.I'm really upset, and now I've wasted an entire day with COREL's software, if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures COREL should WARN people on the package.It looks like I'm SOL and I'm guessing Corel will never bother with a reply.Hint: I think I'll switch to Adobe.Sincerely,Waitman Gobble"
3,Illustrations a disappointment - need to be in color,"It took me over 2 months to get this book, and it was somewhat of a disappointment. It appeared to have been photocopied from an original that may have had color illustrations, because the author kept referring to the color shading. These did not show as well in this b/w copy. It was poorly edited, and poorly assembled. The techniques might be useful for a book that looks like my neighbor copied it in b/w, and is only 18 pages in lenghth, was disheartening. If the writer or publisher reads this, I will trade my copy for a new edition with color illustrations!"
2,Disappointed,"I almost hate to say anything bad about this. The author is clearly knowledgeable and I'm sure I could learn a lot from her. The quality of the book (pamphlet?) is very poor. I've seen mimeographed school projects that were easier to read. The illustrations are impossible to discern. It's not worth the wait, and it's not worth the price. Save your money."
2,Disapointing...,"Hi,I'm a serious amatuer photographer and had heard a lot about this book. This is not a ""how-to"" book. I knew that going in. All the photographs have a black background or a white background. They are all approximately square. The author says he does this so we focus on the photos and not the background. After a few pages I got bored of the white and black backgrounds. If you read Shaw's books he'll tell you that black backgrounds in particular are very un-natural looking. In our world with a Sun a black background seldom occurs. Some of the white background shots look like a cheap Photoshop knockout. Although the author claims he uses only a lighted white backdrop to produce the effect. All in all, just not as moving as many have described it. You'd be much, much better off buying Shaw's book ""Close-ups in Nature"". I ended up sending mine back."
3,so far so good...Full of so many details u may feel like ur choking on them,Reading this for crime justice class...hope its good...Prof had it on reading list so thought id give it a try...well author does try to give feeling to the families pain...so many details of the appeals process left me cold tho...it is an important story to be told tho...good social commentary of the imbalances of justice that can occur in the crime just system....worth the read all in all
4,"Good read, interesting and stirring",The story is stirring in itself. The author writes very well. Some parts are graphic and I would not recommend to a young reader. Overall = like.
3,What year is it again?,"Another purchase back in the '80s. At the time I was happy to find anything I didn't have, however the sound quality sounded then and now like someone just hooked up their record player and hit play/record on their tape deck, and didn't bother to clean the record first.No special mixes, just straight songs.As with most compilations it starts with the TV show theme song. Some songs are I knew from the show and the other albums I had purchased at the time. First side is happy songs, and then it switches to some of the stranger songs fromInstant Replay,The Monkees Present,Head,The Birds, the Bees & the Monkees.Also, D.W. Washburn was only released as a single apparently. Though it has made it onto several compilations since then.If you want their odder and later songs, this is a good album to have. Total Trip.While it's called Hit Factory, I'm not sure half of these even charted.[...]"
4,Like 'em all,I enjoyed all the books in this series because of the characters and the time period. I find them just plain fun to read. All of them are page turners.
3,Overpackaged but Serviceable,"As always, never judge a book by its cover. The cover art and the packaging suggest that this book is a work of literature, a monument to the times it depicts, both provocative and evocative. And the endorsement from O'Brien (whom I haven't read) encourages the hope of a literary masterpiece.Alas, The Guardship is none of these things. It's a potboiler; nothing more, nothing less. It is an entertaining if formulaic adventure story, with plenty of battles and sex. The writing is pedestrian, which would not even be worth commenting on except for O'Brien's endorsement. I found The Guardship to be a Saturday-matinee type book; fun to watch but not likely to make any significant impact."
4,hmmm...,"Not quite sure why Eggplant's discs didn't work... I have never had trouble with these. They work fine for me. I do wish they come in more than just gold or silver though (a reason for the 1-star drop). Oh well...Burning away,Andy"
4,Coverartist,"I received this pkg. of Vinyl CD-R's a couple of weeks ago and really likethe way Verbatim has created the ""vinyl-look"" to each cd. They should haveused more yellow dye when making the gold one as it has a bit of an orange look to it as the Platinum one seems to be a favorite amount most of my friends. Either way, the discs are a great way to show off my cd comilations which I plan on having for many years to come. I can't write a performance review on them yet as I haven't had a chance to burn tracks on them yet, so only time will tell.."
2,Fit for a skeet shoot.,"I bought these CD-R's because I had bought Verbatims before and they worked, and plus, damn did these CD's look cool! I picked up this very 10-pack and got right to burning.Well, there goes about 5 of my 8 dollars down the tubes.Out of 10 CD's, only four worked (the gold ones tended to work, while the silver ones did not). One of the CD's I burned was for my uncle, so out of 10 of these things, I got three CD's out of them. Whoop whoop whoop.I really wanted to like these, because they DO look cool (hence the two-star rating), but the fact is that they are defective, and I do not recommend for anything but cool-looking coasters. Stick to regular brands such as Maxell, Fujifilm, et cetera.On the other hand, if burning an Ashleeeeeee Simpson CD, make sure to use one of these, on the off chance it may not work."
2,NOt really Gold but orange albums,"I was Dissapointed in the ""gold"" CD Album. It was more orange like than gold. I would have much better spent the money on a the platinum cds they look way cooler."
2,Still fit for a skeet shoot,"I had a review up for these earlier, but then one of my Maxells malfunctioned, so I figured it was my CD Burner, and deleted the review until I found out for sure which one was causing the problem.Definitely the Verbatims.I bought these CD-R's because they were cool-looking (they are, you gotta give 'em that), and I had used a couple of Verbatims in the past and they worked fine. I figured I couldn't go wrong.Well, out of the 10-pack, 5 worked (and one of those won't play on my stereo, although it does play in my discman). The rest, simply would not burn. So, yeah, they're defective. Do not buy; stick to Maxell/Memorex/Fujifilm/TDK/Imation/etc.Two stars because half of them did work (the gold ones tended to work; the silver ones did not), and they do look cool. But they're defective. Not recommended."
4,Girl Power!,"Just like the show - girl power! If you enjoyed Charmed, it's a must have to, especially if you want the whole collection like I do/have."
4,The best always come last...,"This is THE soundtrack for the show they should have made from the begining.I already knew the entire CD but bought it and was very glad to see that some of the songs of the CD had different versions from the ones i already had.Even if the choice of a couple of songs seem a bit odd (baby got going by liz phair is a huge song but didn't fit very well the spirit of the show as book,bell and candle by eddie reader totally does).Anyway almost all the songs of the CD were actually heard on the show,exept the one by rose MC gowan and BT which is a very good choice by the way,and if fans should have only one,this is the ONE they must posess.I only have one complain,it's the fact that the song selection is a little bit to known,they should have put a couple of unknown songs like shameless by Idol,which isn't available on any CD.A bewitching mix as a conclusion of 8 years of magic."
3,A BOOK ABOUT FAMILIES FOR SURE!!,"""""BUT I NEVER ENCOUNTER THAT ENTIRE CONSTELLATION, MADE UP OFMYRIAD SATELLITES, THAT WE USED TO MEAN BY FAMILY""""""""THE MOON SHONE NEAR THE FULL ON A CRYSTAL WORLD""""THESE TWO SENTENCES WERE WELL WORTH MY READING THIS BOOK---WOW!!!---WELL WRITTEN. IF I COULD WRITE LIKE THAT - - - -??AS FOR THE BOOK---1/2 OF IT WAS LOST ON ME BECAUSE I AM NOT OF ABIBLICAL BACKGROUND---SORRY. THE PARTS ABOUT HER EARTHLY FAMILYWERE TERRIFIC."

2,Might be good for a learned Physicist,"I am using this book as part of a physics course as an introduction to wave behavior. As a physics major at a school with a very rigorous program, I have already proven myself competent by surviving, and enjoying, my first year of physics courses. Like the student from Cornell said, though, this text is completely indecipherable to a student. I feel that to a physicist already familiar with the concepts that it might provide a nice, more mathematically rigorous review, but as a student just being introduced to this field, it is horrible. Don't expect to be able to learn a thing if you aren't already in the physics field and familiar with the mathematical leaps that he claims are ""obvious"" and that ""follow easily.""For a student: 1 starFor a physicist: I couldn't say.Because I can't review this from others' points of view, I will give it the benefit of the doubt, with the benefit being one star."
5,truly excellent,"Every year for the past 40 years I purchase at least one new Haggadah in preparation for the Seder. This is the first year I purchased an electronic Haggadah and I""m glad I did. It is beautifully laid out and illusrated and the commentary is equally beautiful...rather uplifting in the spirit of the holiday ..I'm not sure how I can use it during the seder, but I'm glad I had the chance to read it beforehand"
3,Not bad but not best,"This is a compact camera, handles well, spunky looking, but a few drawbacks. I like natural-light photography and this is the wrong digital camera for that. First, it has trouble focusing and the manual (LCD) focusing is pretty hopeless in dim light - can't see anything on the screen anyway! Second, the sensitivity is not good - certain other digital cameras have ISO/ASA ranges 100-400, but the Minolta's are just 100. I guess if I was just taking pictures of the Grand Canyon in daylight these wouldn't bother me. I'll be more careful of natural light capabilities in my next purchase. If you take many high-resolution pictures without downloading you'll want to invest in at least 1 16 or 32 mb flashcard ($50 or so.)"
3,Good for the average user,"This is a light weight camera that is easy to carry on hikes and other outings. The picture quality has been good and the controls easy to use. This camera has several draw backs: it will not focus in low light, very bright, or low contrast conditions. It is also impossible to manually focus in these conditions using the LCD screen. I also don't like the red-eye flash being the default. You can change the flash to another mode but when you turn the camera off the next time you turn it on it defaults back to the red-eye flash mode. This is my first digital camera and through this experience I have learned what to look for in my next one."
4,i like it a lot!,I have so far enjoyed shuffling through the pages of this book. I think it will be very useful and also entertaining :)
3,Like a Poetic Dream,"With only a few paragraph breaks in the entire book, this one reads like a poetic dream. Saturated with images, a bit cool and detached, it moves along in pictures more than plot. For this reason, it took me awhile to get captured by the story (for seemingly, there was none). Even then, I was driven more by the potential plots in my head than by any that Sebald had woven. So. If you love a good poem, dig in. In you prefer a good plot, move on."
2,Disappointment.,"As a person who will read anything within my reach, I find it shocking to find myself unable to get through a book. Austerlitz is stagnant, pedantic, and relentlessly dull; the entire work seems to be without affect. I cannot imagine that those who gave it such high regard actually read it. They probably just assume that anything too inaccessible to actually read and enjoy holds literary value. The book meanders aimlessly throughout the years and the cities, touching on what should be some of the most profoundly affecting issues of the human condition -- genocide, identity, family, abandonment-- and manages to make them all gray and emotionless."
5,Physicians Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs and Dietary Supplements 2005 (Physicians' Desk Reference (Pdr) for Nonprescr,great book for your library.
5,Great games,"I played most of these games when they came out. They are all classics. Castles 2, Battle Chess, Virtual Pool, and Fallout are standouts.Since it seems to be discontinued, I guess I'll have to wait for the Anniversary of the Anniversary edition. It's worth the effort to find it used, though."
4,Very nice boot,"This boot is very comfortable. They are strong and durable, and they have a really good fit. The only one thing bad with them is the soles in front have no tread, so be careful in wet conditions. The heal has some tread which does help a lot, all in all it is worth the purchase to try these boots."
5,"Beautiful, just wrong size! Was told they run large!!!! NOT! Not this pair anyway!!","Beautiful, awesome boots if you get them from a none junk shop! Watch out where you buy from!I'm 12 B, ordered 12D - seller said they run large. Nope, returned for damaged 13D and still tight but would have streched. Won't buy from them again on that.Sweet boots though! Just watch who you buy from!"
1,Geisha Music? I don't think so,"Three of the track on this CD are clearly not even Japanese. What's listed as Samurai song, Tancha Meh or Ruined Castle are A Ri Rang, which is traditional Korean folk song. It's also sang in Korean. Also, the song listed as A Ri Rang.. is NOT A Ri Rang. I guess this CD was haphazardly prepared that they didn't even know what they were putting in here. It's an insult to both cultures for promoting such an erroneous info. I wonder if they even asked for permission for putting these songs on there.."
3,misleading album name,"Track #14 - ""Nite Star"" is sung in Tagalog, so the album name is not accurate."
4,"A sensual, entertaining tale with a good dose of mystery.","I enjoyed this story very much. I felt for the heroine, who's been cheated out of her inheritance by her stepmother and lied to by the hero's brother. Morgan had to be the strong one in the family all his life, while his brother shirked responsibility. He marries the heroine to protect her good name, but discovers that he's having feelings for her that are not expected ... or welcome. I found the characters to be multi-dimensional and the author weaves a mystery into the story without slowing it down or interrupting the romantic flow. I think I'll be a Samantha James fan for a long time."
3,Couldn't Really Get if It was Real or Not,"First of all it was an enjoyable read. There were twists in the plot, etc. But Morgan's character was so unbelievably brooding and angry and every little thing that it's a wonder Elizabeth fell for him in the first place. The beginning was a tad bit jumbled. I felt like Nathaniel's character wasn't as developed as it should've been. It wasn't great but it's worth the read, I think. The writing style was eloquent. I think I'll definitely try some more Samantha James but this was a promised premise that didn't fall through as it should have. There was too much back and forth and no real feeling of love between the two main characters."
3,garbled sound on disc,I have played all of these years ago and decided to update to the CD version. I especially like the Notre Dame disc but the sound is garbled. I haven't tried the other discs so I am not sure if the sound is garbled on those.
3,3D puzzles,"Sadly enough I have not found a way to use the program as it does not play on the OS 10 platform. Trying to find an emulator for it, otherwise to send it back or any other solution."
1,The worst book I have ever read!,"Save your money. Do not buy this tripe. This is a book with not only wooden characters, a contrived plot, and no style, it is also filled with a ton of type-Os and grammatical errors.This isn't a REAL book published by a publishing house. The writer PAID for the book to be published from his own, uncorrected manuscript.Save your money and buy a REAL book."
5,exciting,I bought this novel only three days ago and finished reading it already. It was exciting what else can I say. I look forward to Ray Stokes's next novel.
4,Strong and interesting plot,"I personally found the novel quiet a good read. The plot was strong, novel and gave a really good feel for life in a rural English village.I have recently purchased this book and wonder why it appears out of print?"
1,Howard Stern,"Listened to this band today on Howard Stern - Hmmm, this Bernard fella is completely demented and has no sense of reality. He was pushy and demanding requesting his song to be played. Got personal when folk called in stating that the music sucked. Bottom line, this band sucks. Bernard sucks. And, he is one creepy fella from Detroit."
5,Great Book!,Every kid needs this book! This is collection of great people from Helen keller to Anne Frank to everyone in between of importance. This book needs to be in every collection! It is timeless and will be passed down forever.
1,Fruit hell,"The title and smell of ""fruit cocktail"" gave me fantasies of my hair in a tropical paradise. After a few uses of this ""thing""...I realized that my hair was worse than if I avoided it altogether. I gave away the remainder of the bottle. Perhaps it is good for someone's hair...but as I have a curly whirly mane...this honestly did nothing for my frizz and fly-aways...and the amount was so insufficient in the 5.64 bottle...maybe the use of 4 applications if you actually want to distribute it through the hair. I found my hair more frustrating after using this product."
2,stick with carlos,"unless you're a flamenco affecionado or just a guy who occasionally likes to listen to good flamenco, i would stick with carlos montoya personally i did not like this cd"
5,The Beauty of Flamenco,"This is mostly addressed to the frisbee lady.The guitar in flamenco is the least developed part of the music. The voice is what it's all about, it's what makes it most beautiful to the soul, it's what gives it its duende. The guitar and dancing only support it. So, if you so strongly dislike ""the voice"", then flamenco all in all isn't for you.I suggest you read some lectures and poetry by Federico Garcia Lorca, Spain's greatest poet. Maybe then you'll understand this music a bit better."
1,Not even worth $1.75,"Even for free, this book is useless. Leaves of NM, not trees. Couldn't tell them apart if I had to. All black-and-white cheap illustrations, lousy descriptions. Does ""Easy"" Field Guide = Cheap & Worthless Field Guide? It would appear so. Would have given it 0* if that had been possible."
1,don't bother,"Unfortunately, this booklet has no real information to provide. The sketches are only of leaves, which is no good for half of the year, and there's no information about tree form or height. Also, many trees are not listed. Thank goodness it was only $1.75!"
5,A Scrumptious Little Tale...,"This was by far my sister and my absolute favorite children's book. I remember my school librarian reading it to my class in First grade. I checked that book out every time it was available. I would love, love, love to have a copy for myself and to read to my 4 children. Please, reprint this book. It was/is such a loved story!!"
5,Pretty good,"This thing was very easy to mount, and adjust, as long as you have a way to mount a threaded pipe to your ceiling. We clamped ours down with a cheeseborough clamp to a pipe that was already running along the ceiling."
5,Nice Sake Set,"Purchased for boyfriend who hasn't actually used them. They sit around on a shelf and look pretty, which they are. All paintings are very precise and immaculate. No graphics are misshapen or obviously flawed. I'm not familiar with sake sets, so it surprised me when they were much smaller than I imagined."
5,Super cute,"I love this product. I don't drink a lot of sake, so I don't use that often, but even if you just wanted to use it for decoration to show how hip you are--it would be a great addition!"
4,A FILM THAT STRADDLES THE FENCE...,"This really isn`t a bad flick - as reviewer Michael stated, I have to agree with him on almost all points, but here`s the dilemma for potential buyers - It`s too classy to satisfy the sleazemeisters out there looking for mere pulchritude, and it`s not deep or high-brow enough for the Arthouse crowd. As someone who appreciates both, and who has a fairly high tolerance for 70`s pseudo-sleaze AND esoteric arthouse in all their forms, I enjoyed it. Fans of Laura Gemser MUST have it, fans of 60`s Asian Arthouse flix will love the second tale, and just about no one will enjoy Walerian Borowczyk`s half-written saga, which could have been the best story of the three, if he would`ve just given a s**t. The cover is deceptive, as it leads one to believe it is exploitation, but it`s anything but. Blame Severin for this, as they are known for releasing tons of exploitation movies."
3,not as photographed,"for the price, this towel bar is of good quality, however(!) the photo is deceiving. i almost returned it but decided it was not worth the hassle and would have to reorder the same item and most probably get the exact same bar in the mail... reason being, the bar does not come out at around 65degree(ish) angle from the wall. both bars are perpendicular, 90degrees. so if you are looking to add that certain edgy touch to a modern bathroom, this towel bar is nice, but doesn't necessarily push that design element."
5,The Only Book I Would Read,"I cannot believe I have finally found this book, or rather, someone from the website Loganberry Books (Stump the Bookseller) actually understood my description and was able to give me a title. It has literally been 20 years since I have read this book which, at the time, was the only book I had read in years. My high school teacher knew that I was much more into math and science and read Cliff's Notes (Spark Notes' uncle!) for any of the class books we'd be assigned to read. He was so tuned in that he knew I'd be into this book. I definitely was! A total page-turner! I absolutely cannot belive after all these years of searching and searching I can finally order this book and read it again. It's awesome!"
4,User of this saucepan,"I was perfectly happy with this saucepan when it arrived and put it into use. My only caveat is that this line does not always hold up under normal use and cleaning as you would expect from the 10-year warranty. I have had to have one such item (a fry pan) replaced by the manufacturer because of wear of the nonstick coating (which they cheerfully and promptly did). Other items in this line have functioned well for some years, so maybe it's the particular way one is used."
1,Calphalon is not so great,"The almighty Calphalon is not all it is cracked up to be. It is supposed to be nonstick but try cooking an egg in it. Even with a brand new pot it sticks. The pans seem to be too thin and tend to burn things. And I have only used this pot about 4 times, I have always hand washed it, and the lid is already tarnished. Big disappointment with Calphalon. I am having problems with their other pots also. I am switching to KitchenAid Nonstick and Circulon Elite after reading many reviews."
3,non stick,"good product, non stick, little over priced, make sure to get the right size. cover fits perfect, cleaning is easy,handle is sturdy with good grip."
5,Worth the money,Good quality and a good price. I would recommend his product it was a great value. I had compared it to department store deals and this one was the best
4,L.A. County Boy's Point of View,"This is a handy book to keep around to find the best surf spot given a day's conditions. I have surfed every spot in L.A. County and found things haven't changed much since th 70's. However, the POP Pier, State Beach and Marina Del Rey breaks no longer exist. The pictures will keep you longing for those days though. Also, Sunset no longer works in Winter unless there is a big swell, or a negative tide. Also, a picture of Rincon is really a spot further east, but big deal. This book is well worth the small investment and essential when travelling away from your surfing comfort zone. This book is well overdue for an update to address the now more important issues of crowds and localism."
4,locals hate it; travelers love it -- find the surf,"This book has been around a long time. Some of the pictures are outdated but it is still the best single source book on California's surfing beaches. It first came out during the severe ""localism"" surf wars of the 70s and created a terrific furor. Bank Wright traveled the entire coast for two years; saw all, took pictures and then published what he had found. It's one of the few true surf ""classics.&quot"
3,Good basic guide,The beauty of it is that it captures maybe 50% of the breaks on the CA coast - so it's not *too* detailed...
3,You won't go wrong (for the price) if you get one that isn't broken,"The pluses for this thing are the price, the length of hose, the price, the flow control switch, and the price.The minuses are that it's cheaply made (reasonable because it's cheap), it's a bit tough to maneuver because the hose is stiff, and min arrived with a crack that looked like a manufacturing issue and cause a small stream of water to spurt out the side.Seeing the defect drove me back into Amazon to search for a replacement. If you don't mind spending a bit more I think there are better values to be had."
3,Careful with this one...,"This disk contains just what it says, ""Themes"" from Bond movies. For example, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is not the Carly Simon favorite, it is the orchestral theme from the movie. It's a fine recording, but not what you're looking for if you're looking for the hit songs. Make sure you give it a listen before buying to make sure you get what you think you're getting."
1,Convinced to pre-order the DVD boxed set,"I agree with everyone here. I lived in Cincinnati during the time period the show was on in it's original form. I regret not taping any episodes. I had already moved away when it was reincarnated in the early 90's. I can't resist remembering my favorite episode and the gasping declaration by Mr. Carlson...""As God is my witness I thought Turkeys could fly!""Joe"
1,Another vote for WKRP DVDs,"A few days ago I purchased the first season of ""Murphy Brown"" on DVD. Since then I've been pondering what other TV shows I enjoyed enough to warrant buying episodes on DVD. ""WKRP"" tops the very short list (#2 is the ""Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,"" and the list ends there). Did someone here refer to Jan Smithers (Bailey Quarters) as ""truly lovely""? Amen, brother!I logged onto Amazon tonight specifically to see if a ""WKRP"" DVD is available and I had just missed it. No such luck. Interestingly, I see that ""Gilligan's Island"" IS out on disc...yeah, that makes sense.Thank you to the folks here who warned of the edits made on the VHS product. I'd have purchased them and been very disappointed. I anxiously await a quality DVD reissue. My credit card is ready. And to whatever entities might be dragging their heels on the project, these words seem fitting:OH MY GOD, THEY'RE TURKEYS!!"
2,A call to piracy,"For the most part I prefer to reward my favorite actors, directors, crew, publishers etc for their hard work and wonderful effort they put into their movies and television productions by paying for the DVD rather than pirate it. However, the WKRP Box set is a perfect argument in favor of piracy. For them to remove the original rock and roll music from the show because they didn't want to pay royalties to the artists for their music instills in me a desire not to want to pay them. It is almost deceptive because you are expecting to get the original classic work and not something that has been altered in a way that detracts it from its original value. Would it be right to sell a Picasso after painting over the signature? It is not a perfect analogy but close enough. Hence I will just have to Tivo it and burn it."
3,Why not WKRP???,"Just to further comment on the music licensing issues surely holding back the release of this brilliant show on DVD..I can think of a show that had practically no audience when it aired, had wall-to-wall classic rock tunes, and had a great deal of success on the DVD market. I'm talking about FREAKS AND GEEKS.Another brilliant show whose DVD success MORE than made up for it's costs to license the incredible soundtrack.Knowing that WKRP was considerably more successful during it's original tenure on CBS should be proof positive that this would be well worth the investment in releasing it with all original music intact."
4,"My favorite show, but.......","So glad to find WKRP on tape. I'm not sure about the episode selection, though. Who picked these? Where is THE CONSULTANT? Or, Herb's pink frog? Turkey Day? Jennifer's dead date? Venus teaching about the atom? These, and so many others, belong in our collection. Heck, why not the entire series? I know I'd collect them all.As others have said, the writing is superb, and the characters cast so well, that this series deserves to be preserved in it's entirety on tape. My big complaint is the dubbed music. That was a disappointment for me. But, on the whole, I enjoyed these shows very much. More please!"
1,Regrets,"I'm sure it has some good stuff, but without the Turkey Drop, it would be worthless to me. That was the funniest sitcom episode (well, besides MTM's funeral farce--""...a little seltzer in the pants. . .) I've ever seen on TV. They lost out when they didn't include the turkeys with Gordon Jumps great line, ""As God is my witness, I thought turkeys could fly!"""
1,Very sad.,"Pathetic injustice to a very creative classic is done by this video release. Even though it only lasted 3 seasons there has seldom been a sitcom to come along that so successfully satirized pop culture in such a believable manner.Real fans should start a letter writing campaign to whomever owns the release rights to WKRP and demand that it be released on DVD in its entirety as it aired originally, uncut."
4,NEED MORE EPISODES,"The ""Turkey"" Episode was one of the best -- also, the episode when Herb does the ""REAL PEOPLE"" thing -- and they come to his home to video his life!!WHEN Can these become available? ""THE CONSULTANT"" episode is a must, also! Enjoyed the episode when Jennifer moves into a house, and Herb gets stuck moving the Grand Piano!"
5,Great box-set of the best sit-com EVER !.,"This is a great box-set of some of the episodes of ""W.K.R.P. In Cincinnati"" - the best sit-com in T.V.-history !. You won't find a better written, more perfectly cast, gloriously acted, and funnier show anywhere. However, these 8 episodes are by no means the best ones. -They're all waiting to be released. Hopefully ""New Video"" will put the whole series out. No other sit-com deserves it more, I can assure you. So please, how about it ?. But in the meantime, get this box and wet your appetite. K.r.p. rules !."
3,WKRP deserves better treatment,"WKRP in Cincinnati on home video? A great idea, as this was a consistently well-written show, and one of the more intelligent ones from its era, but New Video has done the show an injustice by:A. Releasing only eight episodesB. Using masters with the original rock music used during the network run replaced by stock musicC. At times, resorting to substandard and/or edited copies.Now that 20th Century Fox Home Video owns the rights to this and the rest of the MTM Productions library, it is time to beg them for a DVD release of all 90 episodes unedited and with the original music restored!"
1,Very Sad,"Pathetic injustice to a very creative classic is done by this video release. Even though it only lasted 3 seasons there has seldom been a sitcom to come along that so successfully satirized pop culture in such a believable manner.Real fans should start a letter writing campaign to whomever owns the release rights to WKRP and demand that it be released on DVD in its entirety as it aired originally, uncut."
1,WKRP done wrong,"These videos don't feature my favorite episodes The Remote at a stereo store,Bomb threat,Turkey Drop,and the pilot from Andy's perspective but the show had very few duds.I got fed up with overly edited episodes and sought and found WKRP in Canada UNCUT. You can too."
1,WKRP Canada??,"To the reviewer from Trenton, NJ (Oct 17).... Where did you find WKRP in Canada, the UNCUT version??? Would LOVE to have it."
5,Still going strong!,Bought this for my nephew years ago and it is still going strong and now my 2 kids are using it!
3,View these episodes before boarding your next flight.,"Serling must have had a ball narrating and scripting these two classics, but he embraced them more than the average viewer will. Twilight Zone fans can't really say they are a fan until they've atleast watched these, but people who can't use their imaginations will be put off. Anyway fans, enjoy your flight!"
2,"Great seller, horrible cutter","We have ordered 4 of these for a small stationery business.Out of the 4, 1 has worked perfectly for us. The other 3 being completely not square,Making cutting extremely difficult, off, timely and costly.The shop owner has been reasonable, but we just want a square cutter for accurate cuts.Would recommend the seller, would not recommend these Carl cutters."
3,Made in China!,"I ordered this product for my e39 BMW. It is a bargain if one doesn't mind Made in China product. I can't gamble with my life or risk paying more premium insurance if I were liable when bad luck occurs. ""Stop on a dime"" is motto for brake performance. I returned the product because the shrink-wrapped was perforated when I opened the box."
3,"way too heavy, wrong selection","The book is ok, but it has too many pages and it is super heavy (hard cover version), the first 85 pages has some introduction about industrialization and some very horrible clasic works, wich was useless to me, then you got some nice works until page 337, not one of those mies mind you, then you got chapter 11: Hich tech, deconstruction, and the present day: 1972-1988 wich again is useless, I don't understand why the did not put mies works on this book being mies so carefull and rich about the detail, they miss on great architects, If i had the change to take a closer look at the book before buying I would'nt buy it..."
3,Nice background but not much plot,"The ideas in this book are interesting (but the whole gender-changing thing was done much better in Left Hand of Darkness), but that is all this book really has. I had to force myself to read the first 60%, knowing it would pick up and start to get interesting (her other books are like this too), and it did eventually switch into higher gear, but the twists and turns after that didn't make much sense, and the big dramatic idea that the main character has for ending the conflict left me asking, ""what was that again? ""On the postitive side, the character development of the aliens was really nice. I felt myself feeling a mixture of sympathy and frustration at the way they acted and could imagine being in the human's position and being torn between on one hand wanting to ""play god"" and impose my ideas of how these stupid barbarians should behave, and on the other just let them kill each other if they couldn't find a better way to survive."
3,Interesting plot but not as good as Fool's War,"This book was a good read, but I was disconcerted by the fact that Zettel would occasionally stop the action to describe what everyone was wearing in flowery and very descriptive terms. (She didn't say ""She was wearing a blue tunic,"" but ""a deep blue tunic with detailed trimming, blah blah blah.""The characters' clothing didn't seem central to the plot (as in, for example, Memoirs of a Geisha). So frankly, I don't give a darn what they are wearing, I'd like to get back to the plot please.I preferred Zettel's second book, Fool's War, although this one still moved along quite nicely (aside from the clothing descriptions)."
3,"predictable plot, wooden characters, but readable","The world building in this novel is a wonderful piece of work, including the interactions between human and alien. What I did not like, however, were the all too obvious plot and characters that while realistic, are uninspiring. I would wait for the paperback, unless I was dying of curiosity."
1,"A weak ""Left Hand"" - What a disappointment","A somewhat interesting premise doesn't carry this book. The plot is thin and the characters are superficial. Sci Fi is beyond the point where simply having female protagonists and a female based society, whether human or alien, supports the story, and I thought the story and writing needed lots of help. The conflicts are hackneyed (corporation vs acedemics etc) and not original. I bought this b/c I liked her earlier works, and this is nothing like them."
1,broken,I would have loved these bowls to give to my friend for her Birthday. I was so excited. They arrived broken and I did not have enough time to order more. I doubt I would have ordered them again anyway. They were obviously not packaged very well so they probably would have arrived damaged again.
3,It's okay,"Somewhat fast delivery, no problems with transaction. The product is great for its price, although the kurigata is definitely in the wrong location. A teacher told me that his students simply cut it off and attach the sageo directly to the plastic saya. I might have to do that too in order to do sayabiki and noto properly, but overall functional and a really good deal for the price."
1,Not for use with Cold Steel,"the seller delivered it promptly and they deserve a high rating. the product itself however is poor. The sheath arrived slightly bent and seems to be made of very poor plastic. Also other reviews not how well the sheath works with the cold steel bokken and how snugly it fits, the reason for that is the sheath and the bokken have different curvatures so the bokken will fit tightly, but that it because the bokken resisting getting deformed by the sheath. my cold steel bokken has been scratched and damaged by this product particularly on the back spine. also the hard edge on the inside of the mouth scratched the front of my bokken as well. overall I would not recommend this product especially for use with the cold steel bokken."
3,Not enough room to clean yourself.,"This product is good because it bolts onto the toilet itself and the toilet seat attaches on top of it for comfort and stability. However, there's not enough room to properly clean yourself and urine and cleanser gets caught in the space between the toilet bowl and riser. It was a horrible sight when I removed this riser and saw what was under it."
2,"Looks good, but not practical for long-term use","I purchased this product and wrote a review about it in another review page for the same item. In a nutshell: the bolts are round, but the bolt openings in the riser are wide and oval -- and after day-to-day usage this poor attachment design makes the riser shift out of place. Unlike a toilet seat, you will never be able to tighten this toilet seat riser enough to prevent it from moving."
4,One size does not all toilets,"I got this for my father while he was convalescing from back surgery. It fit our toilet (at my house) fine, but when he was well enough to return to his house it did not fit his toilet without modification. Luckily one of his friends is a very handy kind of guy and he took care of attaching it so that it was safe and sturdy for my dad. Before we bought this we had the seat that looks more like a walker that fits over the top of a toilet, but my dad did not like that one. He found it less sturdy and the drop from where he sat to the water in the bowl was too far. splashing would occur. Being able to go to the restroom by oneself is a very happy thing both for the patient and the caregiver. This seat made that possible. I am happy we purchased it. Just know you may need someone with some tools and plumbing expertise to get a good solid fit."
3,Lots of Prep Time,"This book requires quite a bit of preparation, thereby making it a challenge to dive right into it. I recommend reading all lessons prior to starting."
3,It was ok,Our daughters have English as a 2nd language and so sometimes struggle with school work. We thought this might be helpful to us to help them at home. Some of it is useful but what is in the book doesn't necessarily jive with what they are learning in school.I think it would be more helpful for homeschoolers who are doing their own curriculum. Bottom line is I wished I'd previewed it at the library first.
3,"Some helpful information, but not for my child","This book has general information about food allergies that was helpful. However, the ""cure"" for asthma pertains to a specific group of people who have a yeast in their system called ""candida."" Since that is not what my daughter has, this book turned out to be a waste of money for me."
2,Missing the point,"Another book that I felt had very little to offer that was not already out there. For the past fifteen years, I coughed every morning and night with disrupted sleeping and resulting fatigue. It was a breathing method called Buteyko that changed this.That is whre this book falls - it does not explore overbreathing which is a significant part of asthma.If you have allergies or asthma- look at Buteyko. Many books exist that offer self help. These are the only ones I feel will help asthma.My point is unless a book addresses breathing volume, it will never solve asthma.Do your own research.Jim Holland New York"
4,The Allergy and Asthma Cure,This book has alot of good information to do with elimination diets/antibiotic use and the development of candida albicans problems that cause food allergies. It is an excellent book to read and follow if you suffer from allergies or asthma.
1,"Essential Spanish for Policemen, Lawyers, and Judges","I was very disappointed with this book. It only included a few essential words and phrases, far from essential vocabulary needed for these three professions. One could do better looking up individual words in a Spanish/English dictionary. If I had been able to look at this book, I definitely would never have purchased the book."
1,"Essential Spanish for Policeman, Lawyers, and Judges",Do not waste your money on this so-called book. It is a pamphlet that has little if any value. Very dissapointing.
3,odd but oddly worth it,"I read this book by chance ages ago. It's a strange little book. Clans of people live traveling around the nation's highways. Traveling below 55mph is considered a great source of shame. Meanwhile, huge sections of the nation haver reverted to wilderness. The government works to make sure the clans stay on the road because they don't have anywhere to put them. It's all so strange thatI bought another copy just to try to remember what was going. Also, if I recall correctly, there is a cigarette ad (Kents?) in the middle of the book -- a true mark of quality."
3,It's alright.,"It's nothing to make you WANT to buy it, but maybe download a few songs. In my opinion, Gym Class Heroes really f'd up ""Under The Bridge"". I'd give that cover a 0/5. The rest of the songs are alright, I like most of the bands anyway, but thought the songs could have been done better. Scary Kids Scaring Kids covering ""Losing My Religion"" by REM is the better song on the album."
3,disappointing,"Punk goes Pop is my favorite album, so my expectations were way high for this one. It was such a disappointment. This music just didn't do it for me which is sad because 90s music is my favorite."
2,How the disease/illness attacking her body after all??,"After finished the whole book. I still have no ideal what exactly was her main topic. How the disease is attacking her? What exactly happened to her marriage or all other relationships?? I still have no clue ""WHAT HAPPENED"" after finish reading the book."
3,a double dose a dab too delightful,"Treuer's ""Dr Apelles"" is a powerful tour-de-force. The writer proves himself well-read and well-stocked with echoes from western literary tradition as well as Native American storytelling content and structures. The novel assembles all of the parts into a splendid love story--love of stories and storytelling, romantic love, and caustic love of self and of other. Brilliant as the writer proves himself I believe Treuer goes a bit too far. Clearly a reader's writer, the author overextends his hand with too much repetition. The doubling of character ideas, actions, gestures, and phrases are necessary to weave this complex tapestry through motifs and modalities. However, additional editing would have been helpful to move Teuer's brilliance forward. Lots of high notes in this novel, but more ideas through less words were needed."
2,disapointment,"Much of the CD has music along with the bird songs. The birds by themselves would have sounded much nicer. The CD does not mention that it has music, background trains etc..."
2,Much Room for Improvement,"This was a beautifully recorded CD of the bird songs, except..I d like to listen to the birds' solo without interruptions by some freelance music. If I could just listen to the birds alone it would have been a perfect CD."
5,What an amazing book!,"I seriously could not put this book down. There are so many different stories and legends in San Diegos history. I lived in San Diego for 30 years and had heard a few of these tales, but to have them all together. Wow!"
5,lord of the flies,i thought it was a good book....and would recommend this to any body who is into adventure
5,Outstanding !!!,Saw only episode 3 on PBS. Outstanding review of cognitive ethology. The deleted material alone is worth the price. A great introduction toThinking Without Words (Philosophy of Mind)
2,"Why, why?","Eeeergh! Ms. Stephenson's beautiful, poetic prose, ruined by a forced plot element. I was thoroughly enjoying the opening chapters. Then the heroine's deep dark secret walks up under the hero's nose--and he doesn't get it! Yo, thickhead! Dumb, dumb dumb. Sorry, Ms. Stephenson, I really wanted to love your book. But you lost me right there. However, I would still recommend checking this author out. Her lovely voice is similar to that of the ultra-talented Ruth Wind."
4,The Good and the Bad,"I was pleased to find the Oxford available for Kindle, because I have enjoyed a much earlier, print version for nearly 50 years. The navigation feature of the work is excellent, and bookmarking favorite poems and poets is an invaluable aid.My only complaint, and the one reason why I hesitated to purchase this modern edition, is I knew I would have to wander through the mine field of modern American poets trying to find those whose poetry is not defined by a compulsive use of four-letter words and their many derivatives. Based on a random sample so far of four poets, my misgivings were well-founded. An ideal Kindle feature would be the ability to delete poems and poets that I do not care to have in my house."
1,sooo greasy,"i have thin, frizzy hair. i sprayed one spray of this stuff into my dry hair, at a reasonable distance, and it just made my hair look disgusting. wet and greasy. maybe this would work if you have super thick, textured hair. but if you have thin to average hair, it will just make it look like you sprayed a ton of cooking oil on your head or haven't showered for a week."
2,Gets worse and worse every time I use it!,"I bought this, hoping it could give my hair a sleek, glossy look. Instead, it just made my hair look greasy, wet, and stringy all the time! Many people actually *asked* me why my hair was so wet, and my sister told me it looked like I had dandruff, because a few minutes after it's sprayed on, it leaves flakes. Very unattractive! I thought it might dry just a little after awhile, so it wouldn't look so wet, but it stays like that all day long. It looked more like I hadn't washed my hair in a few days! It's not worth it to have frizz-free hair at this price. Instead, I bought Garnier Fructis 2-in-1 Shampoo, and that worked wonders on my hair! Garnier Fructis actually made my frizzy, dry hair really FRIZZ-FREE, soft and silky smooth! I would highly recommend using that instead if you're having trouble with frizzy, dull, rough hair."
3,Item pictured is NOT what you get,"Product seems to be good but what is in the picture isn't what I received...I only got 2 steel washers and no steel sleeves. After some research from the company, I got what was supposed to be in this kit, So the picture is WRONG. Consumers please be aware of this....This link shows exactly what you get.[...]"
4,Useful Guide on how to implement an identity-theft protection program,"Based on research conducted at Michigan State University, this step-by-step, practitioner's guide shows you how to implement an identity-theft protection program. Author Judith M. Collins includes useful background information about the types and frequency of identity thefts and identity crimes. She emphasizes the steps your company can take to prevent and remediate identity theft. She also provides a chapter on ""best practices"" for customers and advises companies to include these best practices in their marketing materials. If your company is serious about dealing with identity theft, we recommend this book as an extremely useful guide."
2,Waaay overpriced!!,"Wow, this is so overpriced! The items inside the basket are about what you would find in a wal-mart gift basket."
2,Very underwhelmed,"I got this gift basket as a gift from my wishlist, and had to double check because I thought I got the wrong thing! This basket is nothing like the picture! Everything in the basket is cheap. I wouldn't eat the food that comes with it as it was all stale. Definitely not worth the high price!"
2,not that great,"1. the book itself sucks. after a couple of months, my book is ripped into 5 or 6 pieces. i didn't rip it i swear ;). it rips off very easily. 2. the content of it was ok. Introduction to C++ was ok too. introduction to c sucked. i dont think that anyone could have learned the language with this book. i recommand it to those who already know some C and preferably assembly becuz Shildts gets in depth with things that are not very important such as ""twos complement""'s concept and etc. 3. it did a decent job on introduction the C++ language, however, its not very in depth.it sucks as a tutorial if u ask me. but as a reference, its pretty good. i recommand it to those who has some experience in C or some other form of language"
4,I want to learn c++ deeply,i want to read this book. I love to explore c language thats why isearch for this site and for specially read this book
4,A good reference book for Borland C++,"If you have ever wondered what those crytic lines in the BC5 header files really do, then this book will most definitely help you figure it out. A definite must-have for those who compile with Borland."
1,Garbage,"After I played a quick game of ``spot the error'' on this book, it immediately Schildt struck me that Schildt knows even less about C++ than about C.Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of _The C++ Programming Language_ instead.This is a very good book, written by Bjarne Stroustrup---you know, the fellow that actually *invented* C++. Doh!Why would you buy some claptrap from a someone with long-standing history of cranking out awful books when you can have the genuine item?"
4,Going down hill.,"Shows about teenagers usually only have about 3 good years. This show was starting to wear thin. I agree, to much Patty and no enough Cathy. And I like Ross, to bad there wrent a few more episodes centered around him. It was a good thing it ended. I still love it and it's still far better then the crap on tv today, but most shows about teens that dont end after about year three, die a horrible death. Example. My Three Sons and Happy Days. Dragged out for far to long."
5,What is that?,"i love this show, Patty Duke in my own opinion is a very good actress. She was Excellent in this Show, especially when she had a Duel Role to Play."
4,Third Time Not as Lucky,"Apart from two episodes the third season is not as funny or entertaining. What happened to Cathy's and Patty's hair? And since when did the Lanes live in a McMansion? Cathy doesn't get much of a look-in in this series and Natalie's trying to be an aging sex symbol.Boring William Schallert gets to play his own identical cousin, and he plays it badly. Patty and Cathy deserved better scripts."
5,Buy for the Reunion Movie if nothing else,"Well, this had to the be the last season of Patty Duke, because there's no way she could have gone on playing a high school student, she's definitely looking like a full adult here. But I've never seen the Reunion Movie, and I have to say it's the best I've seen that reunites an old cast. Still Rockin' in Brooklyn Heights is superb--the whole cast captures the spirit and flavor of the original, and they used some interspersed old footage to good effect. I wouldn't rate the third season quite as high as the second, but it's still excellent, and as I said--the Reunion Movie makes the whole package worth the price of admission."
4,Patty's Finish,"I loved the Patty Duke Show and even though the third season I felt is a little less than the previous two seasons, I find that I am enjoying this show as well. I liked the fact that the first two shows were based in New York City and even though the third season purports this, it is in fact done in California with some generic New York scenes added. It is still a good show and I'm glad to own it."
4,My Logan Gathers Dust in a Corner...,"The design of the Olfa mat cutter is deceptively simple. However, after using it for several years I can honestly say that it is a marvel of engineering excellence. I own the much more expensive Logan cutting system but this is the tool I use routinely. I love it. For simple mat cutting it can't be beaten -- or at least it hasn't been yet. Keep a supply of sharp blades on hand and go for it! The blades are its Achilles heel -- hard to find but here they are."
2,"bubbles are nice, but loud","A little disappointed in this item. My primary want was to keep the water warm in the mani bowl. seems they sell this item with heat and without. didn't realize that, so i ended up with the unheated version, which defeats the entire purpose, as far as I am concerned. Aside from that, the bubble feature is very vigorous and it does feel great. but the bubbles cool the water off very quickly. do not put any kind of foaming solution into the well, you will have suds overflowing. The motor is loud. Too loud for a relaxing spa experience. Ergonomically the design lacks something too. The well is about 4.5"" off the table and is awkward to use for any length of time without arm support. all in all, i feel i wasted my money."
5,"Brilliant, eloquent translation of Rumi's mystical poems","Rumi's poetry, as brought to us by the brilliant and moving translations of Nicholson, represents one of the highest forms of mystical romantic outpourings. Like Fitzgerald/Khayyam, one is judging the poetic expression of Rumi through the translation of Nicholson. The end result is one of the most remarkable collection of poems, full of emotional impact, weighty with philosophical import. This book is not easy to find, so is a must-have for anyone interested in this subject."
4,If your a GAMER dont buy this machine,I purchased the computer about a year ago and am pleased with its processing speed and ablility do run differnt programs easily. I also love the fact that it comes with 6 months of norton so every six i back up everything and reboot the comp cause im to lazy to by a year package. I have been able to run games like Diablo 2 and other games but recently i tried to install Age of Empires 3 and it runs it but doesnt have the graphics to run it smoothly. If u enjoy your pc games dont buy it if u just want to search the internet and all those little things its a great comp.
3,A little disappointed....,"After two weeks of use I will say that this unit is probably worth the money and I've enjoyed the digital photo editing features. However, after deleting all of the superfluous junk that's always bundled into a new PC I still find the comp a little slow under multi task load. Also, the first game I installed was Sid Meier's Pirates. It will not run. The integrated motherboard graphics aren't up to the task. I'm looking for a new VGA card that won't overheat my system now. If you're a gamer, don't buy this unit. AS"
2,not what I expected,"This CD is not what I expected it to be. I was looking for a good bellydancing CD to dance to. It is not modern or have any drum beats. Unfortunately, this CD is VERY old world sounding. It would be good just to listen to relax or just enjoy classical music."
2,Not Useful.,This account is short on substance and long on speculation. Consciousness is a mystery to begin with and remains so here.
4,A good introduction,"I had studied neurscience in my medical curriculum about 30 years ago, and found this to be a good update. Yet I have also read John Searle, Damasio, Dennett, and I found that the ""hard problem"" (how can neuronal activity give rise to our subjective experience of consciousness) -that gets a functionalist answer in this book (following Dennett) i.e. that subjective consciousness is really an illusion- does not get enough arguments to be really convincing, probably because the format of the book is short. I love Ms. Blackmore' clear writing, so I've begun her other book ""Conversations on consciousness"". By the way this was the first book I've read on Kindle, and it turned out to be a good reading experience!"
2,I must be one lazy intellectual...because I could not get through this,"Either this is too dry and abstract (granted, we are taking on an abstract subject here) or I am one lazy-ass reader. Probably so. I hope to revisit this when I have more patience, but it was too dull after other reads on similar topics that were just so much more approachable."
4,A very short introduction,"An interesting read. Starts well and covers many aspects of consciousness. However I was not really able to bring the threads together. Maybe a glossary and a table (or tree) of theories would have helped.The most important sentences of the book come too late (""We can ask ourselves the question 'Am I conscious now ?'. Then, because we always get the answer 'yes', we leap to the erroneous conclusion that we are always conscious.""). The author gives her opinion at times, which is not a problem, despite not always agreeing with her."
1,Narrow-minded author,"It`s not about science. It`s only about religious point of view!If she writes ""there is much to explore"", she must not say at the end ""consciosness doesn`t exist""."
2,This book mostly ignores Roger Penrose's work,"According to Roger Penrose, consciousness is needed to *_understand_*. So a creature that understands, has to be conscious, and a creature that is not conscious cannot understand. His work is very convincing. He believes that consciousness is related to yet unknown Quantum laws and processes on the brain.My point being, I find it incredible that this author would not dedicate at least a short paragraph to explain his theories which are the most convincing ones I have ever read."
1,Does not fit!,"I purchased these mats for a 2012 Chrysler 300. When I ordered the mats, it stated that it would fit my vehicle. When I received the mats, I noticed that the box stated that it was for a 2010 Chrysler 300. Needless to say the mats didnt fit because the body style is different. I have since returned the item to Amazon and am waiting for a refund. The disappointing part is that I had to pay for the shipping upfront but Amazon stated that they would refund it."
1,what a let down,I purchased this book in hopes that it would help me with procratination. I was so bored reading this book that I kept falling to sleep. If you are honestly looking for a spark or some motivation in your creative dreams this book won't do it. This book didn't help me whatsoever. I am truly sorry I wasted my money. I am just being honest.
2,Simply Put... Black & White,"i usually love sark books. but this black and white one fell flat- where is the juicy colorful pen writing we have come to love? and what about the whimsy?i found this book hard to read, (having different type faces and font sizes,) difficult to follow, (information and ideas not coherent with one another,) and too long.i want to procrastinate finishing reading it.my suggestion would be to find a cheap used copy or borrow it from the library before you decide to purchase it.or perhaps get a copy of ""the artist's way"" instead."
1,Slow Drip Torture Device,"I read all the good reviews for NeilMed and thought it was worth trying to help relive my chronic congestion. I followed the directions exactly and when I started to gently squeeze the bottle of solution, instead of draining out of my other nostril, the saline solution went down my throat and also deep into my nasal cavaties. To be fair, a very small amount did come out of my other nostril. I used NeilMed around lunchtime and for the rest of the afternoon and into the evening, the solution leaked out of my nose in a very uncomfortable manner. I told my husband, ""I feel like I've been upside down in the ocean snorting salt water all day."" I'm happy for all the people that it's helped but my experience is testimony that NeilMed is NOT for everyone."
3,Don't Suck it Up!,"Don't suck it up to get the saline solution deep into your sinuses. I did this and it pushed the infection deep into my sinuses. Made the infection much worse! Follow the directions: Gentle pressure only. To get rid of the infection, gently blow your nose to get as much of the fluid out as possible.This is probably a good product, but you must not suck the fluid up into the deep recesses of your sinuses. Use it gently and gently blow your nose to get as much of the fluid out as possible."
5,Works Great!,"I have various allergies pretty much year round, coupled with chronic sinusitis. This simple little product has made a world of difference for me.I try to use the sinus rinse every morning and evening, and I go with the two-pack dosage. Before I started using this - or if I skip it a few days - when I wake up in the morning, my eyes will be puffy and swollen and my head will feel like it's full of cotton. As long as I use the rinse, this doesn't happen.An added bonus is, in the year's time I've been using this, I haven't had a single cold! That's unheard of for me.I highly recommend this product to everyone."
5,Relief for nasty sinus infection; should I use for seasonal hay fever??,"Last fall, a cold that would just not go away took a turn for the worse and I woke up with the most severe face/cheek and tooth/gum ache! After striking out at dentist (phew-not a cavity!) I tried my HMO and sure enough they gave me antibiotics and NeilMel Sinus Rinse for a ""severe sinus infection."" I have suffered from hay fever for decades, but NEVER anything this painful. I also never tried sinus rinsing, but the Indian doctor guy on the instructions gave me a sense of holistic hope. Wow, it was weird but felt GOOOOOOOD. And yes, the thrill of seeing the gunk draining out of your nose/mouth. My kids were initially thrilled to watch me do it, but as I got better, I stopped. Now.....I am wondering should I do this for my hay fever too? I am so stuffed! And I'm on prescription strength antihistamines!"
4,Good Saline Rinse,If you have sinus problems or just a drippy nose....this really helps. It's easy to use and I like the premixed packets.
5,Much easier to use than traditional Neti Pot,"I first bought a traditional ceramic neti pot and had so-so success using it. However, the fact that you squeeze the bottle and ""force"" the water into your nose, makes this device SO MUCH EASIER! My nose felt much more clear too. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural solution to clear their sinuses. The relief is instant!"
2,Useless for my allergic rhinitis,"Useless for my allergic rhinitis. The product may good for some customer. But for me, it is useless. I didn't feel any better for my allergic rhinitis."
2,Not that big a deal!,This product is full of empty promises. It is not worth it at all. It does not clean your nose thoroughly and the pressure on your ears is quite substantial. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
5,GIve your sinuses a head start,"I live in San Antonio. There's all sorts of pollen in the air, including the dreaded mountain cedar.Our sinuses are the first defence in filtering out pollen. That stuff has to go somewhere. The filtered stuff can be blown out into a Kleenex, can go down your throat, or (worse) puddle around in your swollen sinuses. That could lead to chronic and acute conditionsThe Neilmed rinse bottle is an easy and convenient way to rinse the gunk away. I like to rinse before going to bed, that way I know my body can rest rather than process and clean out a bunch of residual pollen and crud in my sinuses.And the best part is- the ladies think sinus irrigation is sexy!"
5,I dumped my cold in 24 hours.,"Woke up yesterday with a head cold. I rinsed my sinuses yesterday 3 times. Today the cold is gone. I used the rinse this morning again just to make sure. My head is now completely clear. My husband, who refuses to put water up his nose, is on antibiotics and has had his cold for 3 weeks now."
2,Burning Sensation... Poor Customer Support,"***Neilmed has already deleted one of my public posts for assistance: my family and I continue to hope NeilMed will be able to help us.My family and I have been using this product for two years now.It has worked wonderfully up until yesterday.We experienced a very sudden and severe burning sensation upon using the product as instructed.We tried eliminating possible variables (water, bottle, person, etc.) and would like further assistance in trying to source the problem.The said volume of solution has been saved in case it is needed for inspection.***Neilmed has already deleted one of my public posts for assistance: my family and I continue to hope NeilMed will be able to help us."
4,NeilMed Sinus runse,It is a bit handier than the nettypot. It gives a very thorough rinse and opens the sinuses which is very important
4,Rinse worked for me,"Neilmed Sinus Rinse, 1 kitI don't have any allergies and I don't have a cold, but I seem to have excess mucous (post nasal drip) that makes me clear my throat quite often. That's annoying. I use the Sinus Rinse once a day and it helps. It doesn't clear the problem completely, but I'm noticeably better"
5,Excellent product!,"I was given a NeilMed Sinus rinse by my allergist. I had used a Neti pot in the past and didn't really like it that much (messy, hard to mix and often burned my nose). I was a little wary of this product as well. I was totally wrong. The SinusRinse is much better than a Neti pot. It is easier to use, mix, and I love the premixed packets. I have never experienced any discomfort with this product except when I accidentally get the water too hot. I would recommend this to anyone with allergies or to anyone who feels a cold coming on."
1,De-caffeinated ELO misses the mark,"Very disappointed with this CD, which does NOT have Jeff Lynne. Evidently Bev Bevan went on tour (yes, this is a ""live"" CD)and while the audio quality is good, and music very good, the non-lynne vocals don't hit home...I couldn't finish the CD."
3,BSA BOOK,Honestly don't remember receiving nor reading the book. I will have to check my book stack to see if I have it.
4,Parody..again,"The Lost Skeleton is 2 for 2 now. The team is back or at least some of their Twins are! Moving back and forth from Jungle movie to 50's SciFi to the Cantaloupe Dance, the Love Affair with B Movies is still strong. and the most important thing is Animala is back!!"
4,The Lost Skeleton Returns Again,"Sequel to the original Larry Blamire ""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"". Familiar cast of characters and more of that great dialogue and screenplay. If you loved the original you will want to get this one!"
4,Hilarious,"Okay, it's not AS hilarious as the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, but then, what is? As sequels go, this one is pretty great. This time, they are spoofing those ""Land of the Lost"" type of films. There's a jungle, a mysterious tribe of ""natives,"" the Valley of the Monsters, and of couse, the Lost Skeleton, or, what's left of him. It's great and a definite must for any Larry Blamire fan!"
1,A real let down,"I love the first movie, think the jokes are right on in spoofing old sci-fi horror films, and I ordered this sequel as soon as I found it had come out. But this sequel is a huge let down. A majority of the gags are borrowed from the first film and without the edge or the freshness. Most of the scenes felt like some kind of psychological test of endurance with the same line repeated endlessly. I know this kind of thing was done in the first film, but I'm afraid that I'm dreadfully afraid that I'm afraid that in this one... it isn't at all the same. It felt like a joke from Family Guy, as if they knew it wasn't funny and hoped that if they just did it over and over it might achieve a laugh. It doesn't. If you cherish the first movie, you'll wish you'd never seen this one. And when the cantaloupe people make their appearance, you'll REALLY wish you'd never seen this one."
2,Didn't live up to original,"My husband and I eagerly anticipated getting our copy of The Lost Skeleton Returns Again. The first one is our favorite movie of all time! The first half of the sequel was great! We loved the characters and humor. However--after it went to ""techni-color"" (about half way through) we were greatly disappointed. :( The Cantaloupe Queen and people made no sense and her attire was offensive. Pammy's dancing this time was a much too seductive. I would feel uncomfortable watching this with little kids (or my parents). We are pretty conservative though in our movie standards and this just didn't live up.PS--We did love Dark and Stormy Night though!"
5,If it's half as good as the first one,"It'll be twice as good as anything else coming along! And from the previews, I can't wait!The Lost Skeleton of CadavraThe Lost Skeleton Returns AgainDark And Stormy Night"
2,Disappointing,"I found this movie to be very disappointing when compared to the original. Everything seemed very forced this time around, and the movie dragged in spots. Going to color halfway through wasn't a big help either. Disliked the cantaloupe people intensely, but I liked the monsters. The extras were pretty decent too."
3,Book is fascinating but CD is confusing,"Criticism of the CD: What I wanted was a CD where the type of bird would be announced on the CD before or after the song, so that I could listen to the CD without having to read along in the book. (I wanted to learn bird songs during my commuting time, which precludes reading along.) Also, even when using the book, I had a great deal of trouble telling when one track had ended and another had begun, so I was usually lost and confused. This is not the right CD for me."
3,A gift for mom,I really liked the looks of this book. I got it for my mother who is a bird enthusiast but she said it required far more knowledge of music than she had.The last we talked she was going to send it back. Bummer.
1,No longer used by GSUSA,"This was a great resource in it's day. Since 2011, the Girl Scouts have a new book that has replaced this book named Girl's Guide to Girl Scouting. This book can be used for some fun activities, but should not be used to earn pedals.....the new book has the new requirements."
2,Not advisable book (Not recommendable for the beginner....),"I have this book. This book caused my grades in school. The examples given in this book is not easy to absorb. Quite confusing in other words. I am very sorry in saying this, but I failed my final exam because of this book, but I got no choice, because this is the only data structure book that is available mostly in bookstores. Maybe for some, this book is good. I am just a current computer science student, but I can say this book is not good, because I have a lot of computer books, and they are very great. Deitel's book for me is the best computer book. I hope Deitel will publish a data structure book. I have some of Deitel's books, and I am very satisfied with all of Deitel's book that I have. This book is not recommendable for the beginners....)"
4,Why beginner want to read this book?,"I am from Purdue University, this course is a core requirement for Electrical Computer Engineering. I don't understand why are you beginners want to read this book? You have to finished Advanced C Programming before even try to read this book. It is not meant for rookie! This book is Data Structure which teach you algorithms for sorting and search data using binary tree, recursions, linklist and lots other algorithms. There are not much of C code in the book, because once you understand the algorithms, you can implement in any kinds of code you want."
4,Very pretty and my daughter loves Ariel!,This is a very cute doll. My daughter loves to brush her hair and wear the ring and swim all over the floor with her little Mermaid! :)Very sweet doll and we enjoy it alot. Be careful of all the glitter on the dress though as it comes off alot but glitter is sooo fun! FUN TOY!!!
3,cool,i brought this doll at target she's really pretty one of the prettist disney dolls i've ever seen
1,argh....,"this is the ugliest thing i have ever seen! it has the uhhgliest red hair ive ever seen, and it's UGLY face!!EWW!!I DON'T RECOMEND IT! ITS TOOOOO HIDIOUS!!!!"
5,Love the slim design,They protect your hearing and have a low profile too. I love how they don't stick out so far like other ones I've owned.
4,Great product for the price,Slim Design is great for trap and clay sport shooting.Also good for indoor/outdoor ranges if you want something that packs small.
3,Not for Indoor Use,"I took these to an indoor range and they just didn't cut the impact to my ears well enough. These are fine for outdoor ranges, though, and they have one of the most compact designs around. They continued to be comfortable after wearing them for extended periods."
2,PELTOR 97011 SHOTGUNNER HEARING PROTECTOR,THIS ITEM IS OK FOR SHOTGUN OR PISTOL SHOOTING. NOT GOOD FOR RIFLE TARGET SHOOTING. ATLEASED NOT FOR ME.
1,What a piece of Junk,I'm not sure why some people have rated this item so high but it was one of the reasons I purchased them. I guess the people that rated this so high haven't owned a good pair of hearing protectors. This is my third pair of ear protectors and they're the worst. I needed another pair because I can't alway locate the pair I have in the garage. I use them for woodworking machines and when cutting the grass. There is hardly any cushion and it doesn't cut out any noise. Then if you have to wear eye protectors it's even worse. They are useless and were thrown away.
1,Not hearing protector at all.,Probably I have too much expectations on this device. I used for a while and I did not find any noise level difference between wearing it or not wearing it. Very dissapointed. I never will follow product description to buy my next one hearin protector.
1,"Buy them for shooting, NOT for studying","I don't own a gun because I am from a city... with plumbing. I wanted these so I could read in the middle of a crowded place. Simply stated, these do not work for that. And they are highly uncomfortable. I can't wear them longer than 10 minutes at a time. If you wear them, expect to hear everything the person next to you whispers. Yes, they suck that bad."
5,Excellent for office environments..,"Oh my god.. what a relief.. thanks to cubicle lives, Many of us have interesting office environments.. Colleagues that slurp their coffee, talking on phone in a loud voice, etc etc..This product was a welcome relief. I am not a big fan of listening to music at work and most of the products out there are related to ear phones. Finally, I stumbled on this item and decided to try it out.This does not completely block the noise, but it does reduce the noise to a large extent.QUIET time in the office.."
5,You Gotta read this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is a great start to the Invasion cycle. This book is richely detailed and every character (including the least important) play an imporant role. The only fault is, this book is an advanced-reaging book; and it is pretty bloody. Over all, you would be pretty dumb if you like Magic books and don't get this one."
1,Dull.,"Invasion, Planeshift, ApocalypseIn a word dull.This trilogy represents an attempt to extend what would have been a reasonably interesting and well paced novel into a trilogy, with the predictable outcome that its slow, repetitive and over-explained.With few exceptions the characters are shallow, often cutout classical archetypes, who react in painfully predictable ways, rendered in scenes that are excruciatingly repetitive, rich in pointless grapic depictions of action sequences that do nothing to move the story forward, and in fact bog it down. The reader is dragged from climax to inexorable climax and in too many cases can't help but have guessed whats going to be on the next page before reading it.The vocabulary is rich but jarring; it feels like the author used a thesaurus, desperate to relieve the monotony of seeing the same sequence of events playout with slight variations over and over and over again."
2,MTG pays these authors?,"I've been an avid fantasy reader for over 5 years, and am a former Magic: The Gathering player. Although i don't play anymore, I believe it is a great card game, and this novel just doesn't do it's justice. Perhaps this is because I've read...well...GOOD fantasy, but regardless of this, this book is geared for children no older than 12. The book is simply a carnage-fest, and has no depth to it. The characters develop ever so slowly, mainly because Wizards of the Coast told poor J. Robert King to constrain the events of dozens of characters into a 300 page novel. Personally, this author wrote this book pitifully, and if this is his best work, then he should give up on writing."
4,geography still important,"Zook demonstrates that physical geography continues to be a paramount factor in where a startup is located. His study is from the dot com era, and shows the striking correlation and clumping of US startups. Silicon Valley dominates, unsurprisingly. But then there are also major clusters in Seattle, New York, Austin, Los Angeles and Boston.The book shows the prediliction of people in any industry to aggregate, even, or perhaps especially, when there is intense competition between companies in that industry. Ultimately, the clumping benefits the industry, by permitting an easier transfer of ideas and people. So that successful ideas and companies can grow."
4,ISignt Video camera,Great little camera. Very easy to install & use. We used ours on a Macintosh & was able to utilize with little problem. Would recommend this camera to any user interested in creating video mail or video movies.
3,Crisp image? Not.,"For $150, I expect a crisp image with no soft edges in good lighting. What a disappointment, Apple. I even aimed it outside during sunlight, with the window open and nothing in between, and still got fuzzy soft edges. I suppose if you minimize the viewing window to it's smallest little box, it might look okay. This is my second iSight. I returned the first one because of the same issue, only worse. Too bad I gave it another chance. This auto-focus thing is not as good as it could be. I'd rather have control of the focus. It looks nice though."
5,The best camera out there,"This was the 3rd iSight that I bought. Not because the other ones were damaged, but because i bought one for my girlfriend and now one for my mom.I already tried some other cameras on Windows and Linux and non offered the quality of iSight."
3,"Great camera, lousy software, no mount for iMac G4.","I purchased two iSights so that I can videoconference with my mom and sister. The cameras work fine (but do get very hot if you keep them on for a long time). The only problem I still have is with the software (iChat). It works videoconferencing with my mom, but does not work videoconferencing with my sister. All of us use Macs. I have researched extensively in the apple support site, without success... changed firewall settings, router settings... none worked. The only way for me to videoconference with my sister is via Skype, which has poorer image quality.The camera also lacks a mount for the iMac G4, so it has to sit beside the computer screen (not on top of the screen, where it is possible to look in the face of who you are speaking to)."
5,Apple Does It Right,This is a marvelous gadget for those with older Power Macs. Its easy to set up and use. A great tool when used with iChat to connect with family and friends.
5,By far the best webcam,"If you have a mac, I wouldn't even look for anything else. So easy to set up, works with ichat and AIM, looks great, works great (I have lighting, so the low light problems some people talk about are kidna irrelevant) and I love how it uses magnets to attach to the top of my iMac, very spiffy. I also like making cheesy little movies with Quicktime pro. (btw: If you're a student get the student discount online or go to your schools bookstore, about 20 dollars off) Would buy it again, no question."
1,what hearing protection??,"Don't know if I like it or not, it never came. do these behind the neck things work?? don't know -- 2 months later and I haven't received it. They got their money, where is my stuff?? What a pain!! No phone number to call, No other way to give feedback or ask questions. Where is your 800 number?? Anyone home?? Where are you guys?? Where is my stuff. Will order from the local hardware store next time. Real human beings work there."
5,A companion to Small World,"I found ""Small World"" to be a better book, but it is difficult to understand all the ins and outs of ""Small World"" without first reading ""Changing Places."" The reader should also know that David Lodge spent time at the University of California, Berkeley, and this is the result. If I were to recommend only one of his books, it would have to be ""Small World,"" which EVERY academic on the planet will be able to identify with. I've read ""Small World"" twice, once before and once after ""Changing Places."" Buy one to read on the plane going to a conference and one for the trip back. You'll never notice that air travel is far less romantic than when David Lodge was starting his career."
2,"Dated and a Bit Tedious, But Somewhat Funny","Changing Places; Small World; and Nice Work by David Lodge have historical interest in how they cast some light on the life of academics during the late 1960s through the 1980s. Some parts of Changing Places is entertaining; however, these books are quite dated and really tells us little about the realities of life in academia. Furthermore, they display more than a bit of self-trumpeting on the part of the author, and Small World and Nice Work are quite pompous and tedious in some of their faux-scholarly commentary. And, the ending of Nice Work, and the trilogy, really does not lead anywhere. A more interesting and entertaining, if somewhat unusual, view of academic life in the contemporary period in the United States is ""The Legend..."" book written under the name of El Muy Lorenzo."
4,Great send-up of British & American campuses of the '60s!,"Having been a college student during the '60s at a college much like Euphoria, and during the '70s at a school much like Rummidge, I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting both locations at once. I listened to this tape while hiking around the neighborhood, and kept seeing neighbors looking at me with amusement as I broke out in frequent audible laughter. Paul Shelley performs his usual tour de force reading. He amazes me. No matter how many accents and characters he has to mix up in this salad, he keeps them all straight and identifiable, even in the midst of natural-speed conversation interspersed with narration. This particular book was undoubtedly more challenging than most for him, yet he makes it all sound effortless. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to exercise and not notice how the time flies!"
2,Funny and enjoyable but also flawed,"I have read this book after its successor ""Small World"" which I enjoyed very much. And even if it is quite entertaining it does not reach up to the later novel - not at all. It was nice to observe the two protagonists Swallow and Zapp trying to adapt to the way of life at an American respectively British university in the 60s. In describing and satirizing the academic world Lodge is at his best. But having him experimenting with the novel (newspaper clippings make up the center part of the book, a film-script the end) did not seem very convincing in this context. Where the story should really take off it becomes downright boring through this technique. Pale in comparison to ""Small World"" and ""Nice Work"", the third book in the series."
3,Well-written but not especially compelling,"David Lodge is a terrific writer, but this novel is aging poorly. Rather than explore his characters in any depth, he has set up a very mechanical, schematic plot (the two main characters-guess what?-change places! And that's about it), which serves primarily as a backdrop against which he can make wry observations about academia. Unfortunately, these observations, from the late 1960s, are dated, and contemporary readers may not be especially impressed."
3,A light-hearted farce that doesn't quite work,"I was recently directed toward David Lodge's work by a friend when I told him of my unfulfilled quest for a really good satirical academic novel. This one looked fairly promising at first, but quickly turned into a sort of lame romantic comedy centering around two English instructors (who exhange positions for a semester - one in the UK and one in the States) and their respective wives. It has it's amusing moments and the writing is good, but in the end it seems to have gone nowhere... In summary I found this to be a somewhat enjoyable light-hearted read, but ultimately a very forgettable book."
2,disappointing,"Having participated in an academic exchange with a school in England, I purchased this book on the recommendation of a friend who also had a similar experience. I was anticipating something quite different from what I read. Although I found the general story line familiar and amusing, I did not care for the overall work. The book will have little meaning to a reader unless (a) you were either a student or teaching during the 60's or (b) you actually participated in a teaching exchange preferably in the UK."
1,Oh Please,"A couple of years ago, I read Lodge's ""Small World"" (#2 in the trilogy) and had a great time. I can't describe how disappointed I was with this book. Morris Zapp and Phillip Swallow are great characters, but they aren't very likable at all in this particular tome. I also felt that the book hasn't dated well (written in 1975 and set in 1969). The end is also incredibly lame. Yeah, I got what his point was. (He was ambivalent! That is soo interesting! I am incredibly impressed.) The major plot points are also incredibly predictable, even if I hadn't read ""Small World"". The only entertaining thing about this book is the commentary on Jane Austen. I certainly hope ""Nice Work"" is better."
1,review,I give it a half star. it is terrible. very uncomfortable. Not as advertized. It also is plastic which even makes it worse
2,Looking for the Snap-on style. Clasp are not dependable.,"The happy strap 'clasp' come off at the most unexpected times. I lengthened the bra straps to accommodate the center pull with the happy strap applied. When it becomes detached my straps are much longer and feel like I'm wearing a strapless bra. A snap-on strap would solve this problem for many ladies, particularly with the bra designed to wear on the outer shoulder. I did not purchase the round center clip; I don't believe my bras have the additional length needed. My next purchase may be the specialized bra with variable strap placements."
2,So-so,"The idea sounded good, but in reality, one can't attach it very easily alone. So my slipping strap problem still needs a solution."
5,worked great,"Used it for a formal dress with narrow neckline, worked great and didn't pinch or poke anywhere. You will need someone to put it on."
3,Tricky but works,"I bought these even after reading reviews about the difficulty of using them without the help of someone else. It took me a couple of tries but I figured out how to get them on (usually works) and stay on. After the difficulty of getting them on, they do their job. However, I have had it unfasten on me in the middle of the day once- which was a pain. Wish they would make the fastening on this product better."
2,BRAZA HAPPY STRAPS,The straps are not what I want. The hooks are not meant to put on the bra straps. I am not using them.
1,does not work,"Musst be placed before wearing; then it is difficult to put bra on. It is a needed item, but this is not it."
1,"Great idea, just don't stay on","This is a great idea, but they are very hard to put on by yourself, and they pop off real easily."
2,So - So Product,"Definitely not my first choice for keeping my bra straps up. The method that they attach to the straps is not very good at all. They can just pop off very easily. Also, I really should have gotten the larger size to help it stay attached better with it's sub-par method of hooking to the straps.The other type of straps I have bought in past are so much better than these."
4,Necklace,"It's an awesome necklace, little heavy but awesome. Only real issue is that the silver wears off with sweat"
3,--,"This is a peculiar album. The liner notes are vague and grossly innacurate, and there is no indication of when, where or how the CD was recorded, or who the performers are.The music itself is enjoyable, though quite definitely faked to at least some degree. (For example: track 4 was supposedly recorded by the ocean, and indeed, features the background sounds of seagulls and the tide. These sounds, however, abruptly cut out at one point while the rest of the music continues, and then just as abruptly start back in, clearly betraying the fact that they were added in later.)The production value isn't great: the didjeridoos have sort of a muffled sound, which I think is due in part to too much reverb (also faked in-studio, no doubt).But even so, the songs are pleasant, and SOMEBODY must have actually played the didjeridoos and percussion instruments, and done a nice job of it, too. I do enjoy the album, I just find its origins and production suspect."
4,Latin American History,This book offers a window into Latin American history. The story could have taken place in any Andean country and describes the customs and pictures of the people who made those times. An award winnig Book by this great writer deserves the atention of anyone interested in Latin America and it's popular history. It is easy to read and hard to keep away once the story telling begins.
1,what's the point,for a guitar book it has no guitar tabs?for a guitar book it has no guitar tabs?for a guitar book it has no guitar tabs?
1,waste of money,"I bet whoever gave this book a good review was promoting it for the publishing company. This is a terrible book. The transcriptions are not accurate to the recordings. Most of the songs are only given 1 page of transcription-- whole parts are left out, it doesn't include most of the solos, and completely ignores things like grace notes and trills. It includes simplified versions of what Django played; what is the point in that? Do not waste your time or money on this book."
3,Cool looking but not that comfortable!,"I don't consider myself a runner, but I do go to the gym at least 3 days a week and do a lot of cardio. These running shoes are great looking, but I was disappointed with the cushioning. I sometimes suffer from knee pain from a previous running injury and have been recommended to invest in better, more expensive running shoes. I thought these might be way to go, but I don't feel comfortable running too much in them. I've inserted cushioned soles and have help a bit. I have a pair of Nike Navina's; they are much better running shoes."
1,Only buy if you live somewhere were it never rains.,"Well for $99 I thought that this would be a good running shoe. So far it seemed okay maybe takes a while to break in cause I haven't felt the bounce yet. When I received my shoes I noticed the hole in the bottom and sides of the shoe and thought this was not a good idea. But then I figured if it rains the insoles, along with my weight, would block any water from getting in the shoe. Well I was wrong. It had rained and the road was muddy so now a good pair of white socks have to be trashed. The wet mud came through all the holes in the shoe including the insoles which also have holes in them. The shoes are covered with mud now so I don't think I can send them back."
2,The Cheaper IPod Shuffle Armband Not Worth the Discount,"Unfortunately, the reason why you save a couple dollars by ordering this particular armband is because they're defective. The male portion of the velcro is glued to the wrong side of the band. So, you either have to twist and kink the band in order to secure it; or you have to go out and buy velcro and attach it to the correct side of the band."
3,The Middle East,"In my opinion, I think for the Arab-Israeli conflict to end I think both sides need to understand each others needs, And I think the United States should not always and only help and lookout for Israel but also the United States should help, remember, and lookout for the Arabs(especially the Palestinians) and their needs.And the United States should not let Israel do what it wants to the Palestinians."
1,Very disappointing,"This book was required for my son's 9th grade honors history course. Having a strong interest in the subject matter, I went through many of the sections rather carefully. I found it completely lacking in critical facts and had considerable spin in favor of the Palestinians and Arabs with hardly a mention of the extreme prejudice and aggression and hatred brought by the Arabs against Israel. Terrorism was covered very lightly, the 6-Day war was started caused by Israel (little mention of the huge build up of Arab troops on all fronts, the closing of the Straits of Tiran and Nasser's persistent anti-Israeli ranting, etc.) This book is hardly informative unless you want to carry a naive and misinformed understanding of a very complex issue. It perpetuates unreasonable bias and prejudice and is rather shameful as a product presented to school children to learn about this subject matter."
3,Still A Good Processor,The Intel Core 2 Duo is still a good processor. I am only giving it 3 stars because AMD offers more powerful processors for less than what I paid for this.
5,I listened to it three times today,"This man has the sexiest voice. Like Tom Waits on the nights he wakes up sane. ""Equanimity,"" ""The Moon I Dream Of,"" and ""Mandrake"" in particular have a dark haunting musical and lyrical beauty that makes me play them again and again."
4,Comprehensive and easy to use,"I have found this program to be very useful. I am halfway through the book/tapes and can use rudimentary Portuguese already. It builds well on what you've learned already and the tapes are extremely helpful -- I use the tapes much more than the book. Strong points are: sentence structure, verb tenses, phraseology. Weaker points are: vocabulary. There is no vocabulary list or dictionary style listing of words -- so I needed to buy that separately, for looking up unknown words. I highly recommend this course."
3,Nice way to learn Brazilian Portuguese,"Yes, this series is a great way to learn ""some"" Brazilian Portuguese. The cover claims that you will be speaking fluently in no time.. yeah right! With this series, you may learn the very basics of conversation & grammar. Other than that, this is a very practical-- and useful-- guide to simple conversational Brazilian Portuguese."
5,"Excellent, and easy to use!!",I bought this program to learn Portuguese so that I could converse in my girlfriends home language. This course in no time helped me build my conservational base and allowed me the ability to speak and understand people from Brazil. I am glad that I purchased this program especially at Amazon's excellent price.
4,Good Basics,"This program provided me with excellent opportunities to master pronunciation and learn a lot of useful basic vocabulary as well as understand the structure of the language. My one complaint is that in 12 tapes, i was hoping I would get to a more advanced level. They repeat the same vocabulary a lot throughout the course instead of introducing other useful words as the course progresses. I had hoped for something that moved along faster since Portuguese was not my first foreign language. But overall, this was an excellent course."
1,Wrong book!,"I bought the ""Mastering Portuguese"" to teach my husband Portuguese. The BIGGEST problem was that when I opened the package, it contained a Korean book instead of a Portuguese book. I checked the audio cassettes and they were all Portuguese cassettes. I am having a really hard time to exchange the book and I would appreciate if someone could help me.Thank you.Ana"
2,For Those Wanting to Learn Portuguese,"FSI Mastering Portuguese is a well organized presentation of basic information on the Portuguese language. It gives the user a more in depth understanding of the grammatical structures of the language than the Pimsleur tapes provide. However, I don't feel that this material works well by itself. I think that this material works best when the user has studied the Pimsleur Portuguese Tapes first and has some knowledge of the basic elements of conversational Portuguese. There is a major problem with the FSI tapes due to the incredibly poor quality of the recordings. Many of the recorded conversations were unintelligible. My daughter-in-law, a native born Brazilian who lived in Brazil for the first 26 years of her life, was unable to understand three of the twelve tapes. If you have never been exposed to the language before listening to these tapes, I think that you will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to understand a large portion of the material."
1,rip off,"This material is copyright free as it was developed by the US government with tax dollars. It is in the public domain and can be downloaded from the web as a number of other FSI materials. Don't be fooled into paying for it. Just search for ""fsi language courses""."
5,SWITCHING code,"You want to speak Portuguese like a Brazilian? Like a Portuguese? Like a Brazilian: pronounce all vowels fully. Put vowels even where there is no vowel, live ""pneu"" /pinEu/ or ""advogado"" /adjivogAdu/. To switch to Portuguese from Portugal, forget all the vowels, only pronouncig the stressed one: ""advogado"" /dvgAd/, ""Portugal"" /prtgAl/, and so on. Very simple."
1,I got a defective item,"I bought this watch from Mytimepiece. The watch is defective. It always stops at 10,45 and two buttons out of three does not work properly."
1,Didn't Even Receive It,"I ordered this book in the beginning of January, expecting it to be delivered by the beginning of February, (this was also according to their shipping statement). It was the 7th of February and I still hadn't received my book. I submitted a claim to Amazon.com, and luckily they gave me my money back. I wouldn't trust this company period."
4,Good Western!,"""Warlock"" is a very good film, beautiful scenery, well-acted. Apart from the bigger names--Fonda, Quinn, Widmark--Tom Drake does an excellent job in his role. It's interesting to see Drake as a villain, having already seen him in juvenile, ""nice young man"" parts filmed during his tenure at MGM, and I believe he was a versatile, underrated actor. Good western, well worth watching."
3,Fascinating,"Fonda and Quinn have wonderful presence and charisma. Widmark's character has none. As he is the 3rd key factor in this story, this is too great a failure to hook me into caring for him. Not least, for this reason: although all 3 are killers, Widmarks mass-murderous past makes his new-found 'moral code' somewhat shakey. I enjoyed the movie for its ideas and complexity nevertheless, and for 1959 it may well have been worth 5 stars, but today we expect the script to be a bit tighter. I found far too many moments of Huh? What? Where did that come from? ... as the characters changed their behaviour and attitude too suddenly for me ... against the apparent flow of the tale. Perhaps something like a modern miniseries would be needed to give such an interesting story the space and the time to fulfill its rich character study potential. Fonda and Quinn make it definitely worth a watch, and the 'huh?' moments do make you think."
3,Nothing Special,"Good acting - Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark, Anthony Quinn, etc. But no actual heroes, no one really wins, everyone seems to lose. A strange western. Nothing special about it really."
2,Sleeper.....,"This has to be one of the worst westerns I've ever seen. Anthony Quinn mumbled through most of it. The background to the story went largely unexplained. The behavior of the characters, at times, were simply unexplainable. Don't waste your money buying this one."
2,worst customer service on the web,"I chose to buy the dvd from them because they are a NC based company and they guaranteed delivery withing a week. the product took over two weeks to arrive and when it did the package literally had tire marks on it. obviously at some point it was run over by a vehicle. the case was broken, the dvd scratched.i sent an e-mail and received an auto response. i called the company and they only have voice mail. I called during one of the three house a day their website claims they are open and they were in fact not.returning the dvd was not easy and the company took zero responsibility.its over a month, have never gotten a reply from the that was not a pre-generated bit of spam or a phone call, let alone any human contact.still have no dvd, paid for it and fully expect to never have anything like justification from them."
5,A Timeless Classic,"Crash Bandicoot Twinsanity does not have the same exact gameplay as the original 4 Crash games, but the gameplay type is still very fun. No matter how old this game gets I personaly think it will always be a fun platformer for all ages to enjoy, I highly recomend you click that add to cart button :D!"
2,I stopped playing it,"Crash Twinsanity is when aliens for a different galaxy come and threaten Crash and Cortex that they are going to take over their island. The story itself was bad. They settle their differences and they work together to save the island.The GOOD THINGS about Crash Twinsanity:The graphics- The graphics are better on this game than on the newer games on the Xbox. Most Crash Xbox games has gone well with the graphics.It has the main characters- This game has the 2 best characters in it and they are working together. It is kind of interesting.The BAD THINGS about Crash Twinsanity:The story- This game has a bad story that when I first started playing it, I was like what? What is really going on?The replay value- Replay value is how long after you get the game will you play it. I gave up on the game after about one month. I found a new game and started playing it.The game is alright, but it need to be more interesting."
1,BOOOOOO!,"This is not the crash bandicoot who i see in the Playstation,I cannot think that Sony has acept that their personages were in x-box or in gamecube ""SONY ABOUT WHICH YOU WERE THINKING"" ¡OH MY GOD! THis is a Nightmare Okay,okay...that was very exaggerated but it was an injustice dead to the x-box."
5,GREAT DVD'S (gold in a box),"This box set is amazing. All the characters are developed and funny, and the special features are neat. Despite the double sided DVD's this is the best dvd box set i have ever bought. If you love or loved the show, buy it. Since i am of a different generation, I only recently descovered the show and I love it."
4,I still like it!,"I still enjoy the silliness all these years later.In the first episode of the set, Boss Hogg and Uncle Jesse are RACING, and Cooter catches them in his tow truck to help save the day. Only in Hazzard County is a tow truck faster than a Mustang and Camaro!"
5,Satisfied customer,Order arrived very quickly and was just as described. These shows are my 3 year old grandsons favorite and they watch them all the time.
1,Boring!,"I bought this book because of the interesting title, but that's about the only part that's really interesting. The book put me to sleep after 5 pages. I would recommend a help book for writers, but you may want to stray away from this one."
3,Close but no cigar,"This is a a great kit and has most of what you need. However the platic in my inside came warped, and the handle lock in so firmly you have to yank them to get them out."
5,cleaning kit,i bought this cleaning kit to keep in my car when i go to the range.comes in very handy for a quick cleaning at the range
1,"Missing parts, Cheaply made","My kit arrived with parts missing. Everything was in disarray, with just a few parts resting in their spots. After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs, I opted to send it back. The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap kit. I didn't even try to use it...just packed it up and sent it back. What a disappointment."
1,"Sad , downbeat. Underside of life. Not ""Madeline""",Stories and sketches from 1935-1955.The book is sad and downbeat. I did not find it funny. Much of it about his military service and immediate-post-war Europe.Gave up trying to read it several times. Just now opened it at random. Even the cafe society and travel pieces focus on the ugly and the underside of life. The flip side of the creator of Madeline.
4,British Empire,"For the British Queen Victoria is an icon in British history, but for the natives of British colonies, Her Majesty is the queen of mean for the rest of world.In order to colonize chosen areas the British killed and enslaved the natives who dared to resist. The laws were only imposed upon the natives and not valid to the British. The British by any mean shipped the best of anything from the colonies to England; some given to the Queen or her family members; some remained in the British Museum; some granted to those who wre knighted.Foe example Greek government has been requesting the British for returning statutes."
3,This is not a biography of Queen Victoria!,"Note the title is Queen Victoria's EMPIRE, this is a documentary about the British Empire during the 19th century not a biography of Victoria...who just happened to be the queen then. What did I learn about her life? She wrote letters every now and then. The filmmaker found Prince Albert more interesting than Victoria! I saw the first 2 hours, got so bored I didn't watch the last two."
3,there realy nice,They look great with what I bought but they roll down some but other than that there great I like them a lot and they look good with more of my stuff to
5,Can't live without this in our office,When I began my new position I was told that we had to go through a certain company for our office products. This company does not carry the BIC Grip Roller Pen. The guys in the office can not live without this pen. They swear by it and love the way it writes. I was very excited to find this pen on Amazon and will order this pen in the future. Again they can't live without it.
3,Good Book,I had to purchase a book for class and it worked out fine. It is rather simple music books but if needed it works.
1,"No details, impossible to learn from",This book covers a huge range of topics. There are no details. I am unable to work the homework problems with the details provided in the text. I'm googling information and will purchase a few more textbooks so I can learn something. This book might be good as a reference book if you already know what you're doing.
2,ummm,"the thing that you receive is not the the same as you see here.it is just simple but in the picture you see that it is like glassy ones.do not wast your moneyCharles Leonard Inc. Push Pins, Assorted Colors, 100/box (200-AR)"
3,Royal Protocol,"I really enjoyed the story. Reading the book in one day. However, the ending really upset me....the prince was still locked up and I didn't know how the King was poisoned? Who was the inside person??? Did the Lady in Waiting get married?"
3,Be prepared for a downer,"Well written in a brutal way, but there is only so much I can take of stories about depressed, alcoholic macho men who are hurting everyone around them. If you live like this, you might get more out of these characters than I did, but then you would probably not be reading a book in your spare time. You'd be drinking and driving and arguing with your spouse instead."
3,Cute idea,"This is cute for the mommy that likes to have all the little trinkets (which is so me). But it's not necessary to own, and in fact it's kind of a pain to use. The pocket is a little small for even the smallest pacifiers. When my daughter was screaming, the last thing that I had time to do was fumble for a small bag, only to have to undo Velcro and finger the pacifier out of the pocket."
5,One of the very best writers of any genre active in America today,"It's hard to imagine how this guy keeps raising the bar on himself. He's so far past everyone else in the crime space today, that we either have to go way back (to George V. Higgins) or to other genres (Joyce Carole Oates) to find people who can match his dialogue, levels of plotting, and moral tone.The other reviews have made good points about the economy and amount of the prose in Drama City compared to prior works. Fair points, but neither takes away from a very well thought out, multi-layered plot which Dickens would have proud to create.For Pete's sake, if you haven't read anything by Pelecanos, you owe it to yourself to start now assuming you like fine writing. Drama City is a great place to start. So is The Big Blow Down. So is King Suckerman. You have 13 wonderful books in front of you."
4,Very good characters and highly readable...m,"While the plotline is routine and almost predictable, Pelecanos makes it work. I love his characters--both Lorenzo, the ex con trying to go straight, and Rachel, the Parole Officer trying to get straight, are very likeable and sympathetic characters. Their depth carries you through a less-than-moving plotline. I will be reading more of Pelecanos' work."
3,Just Read Walter Mosley Instead,"This was the first Pelecanos novel I've read, so I have no idea if this street-wise drug tale is his usual shtick. But it definitely read like an homage to Walter Mosley: ex-con who used to be the baddest mutha in the hood, constantly trying to avoid being dragged back into the deadly but futile game -- you get the idea.Maybe Pelecanos has a different demographic than Mosley, so he's hoping folks won't notice the similarity? Who knows? In any case, you're better off reading the Mosley books themselves. They ring truer and sound more genuine.In any case, this is not a bad novel. You can make your way through it in a couple days. The characters are nothing new, if you have experience with urban life. Maybe that's what Pelecanos wanted: absolutely predictable characters to drive home the banality of crime, to perhaps deglamorize it. But the plot just doesn't rise past the drabness of the cast."
4,High-quality Pelecanos,"Lorenzo Brown is one of Pelecanos's great characters, a man whose quest for redemption will break your heart as you read this wonderful story. I agree with some of the reviewers that the Rachel Lopez character is a little weak (writing women characters isn't really what Pelecanos does) but reading Lorenzo's story makes it all worthwhile. Kind of like the Cutty Wise character from ""The Wire,"" Lorenzo will never be a saint but he knows his code and he lives it. The set-piece between Lorenzo and Melvin Lee at the dog fight is the kind of a scene that Pelecanos writes better than anyone. Highly recommended."
4,Dialogue and character that's right on target.,"Drama City is to crime/inner city/street life novels what Shakespeare was to sonnets. Perfectly pitched characters (except unfortunately for the lead female). Nevertheless, it's next to impossible to write an engaging novel about a dysthimic, hard-scrabble, life is a bitch character with one basic emotion, but it works here. The dialogue is crystal clear; it's rare that an author can get into so many different character minds and render them truthfully. Not a misplaced syllable in book. Even the minor characters are believeable and it shows without lecturing that the anger and violence of life on the streets is the result of feelings of helplessness and confusion. Should be required reading for every politician and sociologist and psychologist."
3,Semi Drama Time,"The book makes me miss Derek Strange. The subtle reference to him was the best part of the book. I took it out of the library after having previously paid for all the Derek Strange series.I respect GP's knowledge of DC geography and history, but I feel his best work is behind him. Seems to me that nothing he's written since Right as Rain has been as good. Hard Revolution had it's moments but it was a double not a triple. I'd say his work is derivative of Elmore Leonard or George V. Higgins (as noted by others). Come on George you've got a great novel in you!"
3,Not my favorite book,"Ex-con Lorenzo Brown is doing well on the outside, working as a Humane Society officer. His parole officer, Rachel Lopez, isn't doing as well. She is fighting alcoholism and tries to hide it from those she deals with on the job.When a gang turf war breaks out in Lorenzo's old neighborhood, he is afraid of getting sucked back into the life he wants to escape. But then Rachel and Lorenzo each get drawn in for different reasons. Can they help each other escape with their lives?Though the characters were well defined and quite human, the background of each of them and the buildup of the story took so long I struggled to keep reading. The book is listed as a suspense novel but I didn't think it was very suspenseful. This is my first book by this author and I probably won't seek out others. This novel was an Edgar nominee for Best Novel so obviously a lot of other people liked it.Armchair Interviews says: Interesting take on ex-cons and parole officers."
5,Monisimo,Compré esta placa para el vehiculo de mi mamá y a ella le encantó. Se ve bien sweet. Es tal como se muestra la imagen.
5,Agreed!,I purchased a pack to try it out and loved it. I have since been wearing these for the last 4 years. They last longer then others and they fit great. I agree with all the other great reviews here.
3,Hector's solo career got jump-started with this album.,"""Macho Perez"", ""Desnudate"" and ""Noche Sensacional"" were among the songs that catapulted Hector to solo stardom and this CD was a fine successor to his debut (""Clase Aparte""). Like most of his salsa romantica contemporaries, Hector is (naturally) no match for yesteryear's legendary soneros but both ""Motorizame"" and ""Clase Aparte"" prove that Hector is a better singer than most of his peers."
5,Excellent introduction to Ganesh and Indian mythology.,"A well written and highly readable book for children and adults alike, ""The Broken Tusk"" allows children to get to know Indian mythological figures as they really are - with godlike qualities and human frailties. Gods, demons and humans all take on a certain lovableness in this book. The author has presented popular versions of Ganesh stories, without sermonizing about good and evil, leaving the reader to draw the obvious conclusions. Children who are interested in different cultures are sure to enjoy this one, especially young Americans of Indian descent. My 8 year old, a real nature lover, who is fascinated with the multifaceted aspects of Indian mythological figures and their oneness with animals and nature, found it an eminently attractive book to read and to own. Clean, clear illustrations which take on a life of their own also add to the charm of this book. A handsome addition to any library, I recommend it highly."
5,Good intro,This a great introduction to Ganesha for kids. My daughter is five and she loved all the stories.
3,ultimate 21 day training programme?,"how many utlimates can we actually have? I assume many as here's another one. Covering topics such as 'world-changing creativity' and 'life-changing lessons in creativity' you'd think this was quite unique and powerful stuff, right?Not quite...with force field analysis, SWOTS and concept fanning being part of the 'training program' you might just find some well worn muscles being given another workout. There's some interesting stuff in here (ie. few authors on creativity head down the alpha training path anymore) but these are just too few to get really excited about the book."
5,nice watch!,"My husband wanted a watch to wear around the yard, house etc. because his other watch is a Rolex. He likes the look of this Armitron watch so much, he sometimes wears it instead of his Rolex. It works well too."
2,Not Really A Book,First of all this is not a book. It's a deck of cards with a different project on each card. While there are some good projects the basic format is disappointing and the small print on the cards makes it difficult to work with.
1,Disappointment,"I should have read the reviews before ordering what I expected to be a book and turned out to be a deck of cards. Out of the 52 projects, we will probably only do 4-6. Won't make the same mistake twice!"
1,1/2 size guitar does not fit.,"Arrived slightly damaged, but worse was that the 1/2 Size guitar we purchased with Amazon will not fit. This is too small for it. Now I have to return it and find another. 7yr old grandson was so disappointed."
4,A great starter guitar,"All my boys love this guitar. It has been a year and it is still in great condition even though my boy can be rough with their toys (they are 7,5 and 4)"
4,Jud Strunk,"Great, hard to find album from the Rowan and Martin Laugh-In days. Jud was a regular on Laugh-In for a year or two toward the end of the show's run."
3,"great music, dismal sound quality","If you're interested in the music of the great Manitas De Plata, buy another album. The music on here is wonderful, but the sound quality is awful. So overdriven at times that it is hard to listen to. I should probably give it less stars, but I don't want it to reflect on the music."
3,beware,"Largely Manitas in his raw-cous and impatienFlamenco. Only a couple of tracks which escalate into exciting playing, probably a rhumba one of them.Don't be put off by this artist just do some research surfing sample tracks and if feeling rich buy the vinyl LPs from early days. I have a vinyl which collects his rumbas and is much better than this commercial offering . It sounds rough and spirited with Manitas skill and flair.My mother has an LP from 50yrs ago. It is called ""Hommages"" with Bridget Bardot propping up a bar on the cover. Hommage to Pablo Picasso and other hommages to artists he loved. There is an extremely stirring Hommage to my Mother too. It shows he can push past the gypsy bravado into something richly thoughtful. I tracked it down in the Netherlands on EbayMeanwhile a CD worth having is Live at Carnegie Hall.Shop around but you can do better than Flaming Flamenco."
3,"Editor, you forgot the audio!","Manitas de Plata, a unique guitarist in his own right. More so because he seems to make up his stuff as he is playing and very loosely follows traditional flamenco compas. He is, without a doubt, technically gifted but like mentioned before, Manitas is in his own world, whether it be flamenco or not. His sound is unique and has all but been rejected from flamenco aficionados. I enjoy his music but if I were to get up and dance or provide palmas to his music, I wouldn't know where to begin or proceed. There really isn't any structure to his music.My 3 star rating is not based on the music of this cd but rather how it was recorded. I kid you not, it sounds exactly like it was recorded with a low budget camcorder. The audio is not full or rich, it lacks the lower frequencies and there is absolutely no impact. All you hear is treble and midrange in the upper registers. Listen to samples of each song on iTunes and decide for yourself if you can live with the audio."
3,I stand corrected,I haven't read the book and I apologize for putting the movie review in the book comments...I again apologize for causing confusion between the book and the movie
5,"This is THE book, not the MOVIE...","First off PLEASE pay no attention to Richard B Parker & Ezekiel E Russell's reviews of this book. This is not a flame against them but neither of them actually took the time to READ the novel, therefor they have no right to review the book for better or for worse.With that said if you didnt like the movie there is a very good chance you will like the book. It has a more serious tone, more character developement. You will learn more about the supporting characters Nora & Elwood. There is more action and history. Basically there is just MORE to it! Don't pass up this novel because of what you thought of the movie, give it a chance :)"
1,"Too bad there wasn't a ""negative"" star option....","I'm a 20 yr Dungeons and Dragons veteran {I'm 34 yrs old) and I just saw this as a live version of the old Dungeons and Dragons series. At least the cartoon was geared towards Jr/Senior High age viewers. Okay, okay...at the time I enjoyed the cartoon.But I was expecting an epic style picture...not some ditzy female magic user and some thief that spits and sputters at the very mention on trying something dangerous...none of the thieves EVER acted in this manner. Well, some did after getting in a losing combat situation. Save this one for the Power Ranger's crowd."
3,Trust your instincts when deciding to buy this one.,"Yes, everyone does mention the crowd noise in the background. You can hear it when sampling the music, it's overwhelming, but I still couldn't resist buying it because it just sounds like everyone is having such a good time. I think that's the ""hook."" I may use it at my Oktoberfest, but for those who like to sing along, or even attempt to, this will prove difficult to do with this CD unless you already know the words and melody. I would say you hear 25% voice and 75% crowd. If they could have only reversed that, this CD would be perfect for me. But if that's what your looking for, Prost!"
2,beer songs,"SONGS ARE RECORDED FROM AN OCTOBERFEST CELEBRATION SOMEWHERE,SONG LYRICS ARE NOT COMPLETE ,OR AUDABLE AT MOST POINT.THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING IS THEY DONT FINISH MOST SONGS."
3,Best to Enjoy When Drunk,"This compilation of 14 German drinking songs has lots of noise and merry-making in the background. It is obvious that the singers are having a good time, having partaken liberally in the products of the Braumeister (or so it would seem).While the songs include all the favorites of German Kneipekriecheren (pubcrawlers), which all good Bavarians know by heart, the loud party noises makes the lyrics difficult to understand, even if you're fluent in Deutsch. My personal favorites include ""Bier Hier"" (misspelled in the liner notes) and ""In Munich Steht ein Hofbrauhaus.""What the heck. Pour yourself a Hefe-Weisen or three and enjoy!"
3,Theme Party cd,"This is another ""Theme Party"" cd, I have purchsed better German sing along song cd's that this one, but it is o.k."
1,"like most Siltbreeze things, the IDEA of it is much better than the actual","soundz like poor scrappy outtakes from early Superchunk, recorded thru a busted microphone loosely connected to a junky boombox. its crap dressed up in cooler-than-thou affectations."
5,Nice Size Pocket Prayer Book,"Bought this to keep in my purse. Nice to have something small. Has common prayers, but not all missal readings, etc."
2,Marred by cheesy illustrations,"St. Joseph's could have put twice as many devotions in this little book if they hadn't handed over so much space to simpering, circa 1940s pious illustrations. I don't really need a greeting card Jesus picture to help me focus on prayer; in fact I find myself distracted by it. I've had this problem before with little prayer books, unfortunately. Not sure why the publishers are so sure that people who pray regularly must also be people who appreciate this kind of Precious Moments stuff."
5,Pocket Book of Catholic Devottions,This is a brand new book. An excellent tool in worshiping the Almighty.It came to me in new condition. A must for all of todays Roman Catholics.
3,Euro-Med Plastic Molded Hair Rinser,We have used this type for many years. The original Rinser was made of a thicker hard plastic. It would eventually crack because pressure is needed to tilt into an awaiting pail. The Euro-Med is made of a much thinner plastic and actually cracked the second time it was used.
5,very practical,"My order arrived on time, I'm very pleased with the product it's very practical.Easy to use and easy to clean and doesn't take much space to store."
2,easily warps if cleaned with very hot water,"One was ordered for surgery, unfortunately the plastic was of a very thin consistency that when someone tried to disinfect it,it warped out of proportion."
5,iBook G4 Battery,It doesn't fit exactly into my iBook... but I knew that was possible from reading other reviews. Works great anyway.
2,Battery did not work for very long...,"The battery that was delivered worked fine for three months, but after that time it would not hold a charge, and still doesn't. The laptop has to be connected to wall power in order to function, and, if the computer gets unplugged, it loses power immediately. I would not recommend this battery."
5,just in time,"My battery arrived just in time, as my original battery stopped holding a charge. Now I have over 5 hours (theoretically, I haven't tested how long it actually lasts, but it's at least 2 hours). My 7-year-old iBook has a new lease on life! And the price is right, because I didn't want to spend a lot of money on such an old laptop."
2,Very poor condition,"I ordered this battery thinking that it was in decent condition and had decent battery life. When I got it, I only got an hour of battery life when I should get 3-4 hours. Now I only get 45 minutes at max. Don't buy this battery used from people, they tend to exaggerate the truth. This one came with only 224 cycle counts. That is really poor condition.Do yourself a favor and spend more money for a brand new one, you will appreciate it."
4,works good!,"glad i bought this battery. someone gave me this vintage G4 Ibook and I did not want to go through apple to pay a lot of money for a new battery which it needed. The item came fast, popped it right in and it worked great! So far so good. Its so cheap even if the thing stops working as good, it was totally worth it. Would order parts from them again."
1,Fail imitation China junk!,"Doesn't even fit the iBook perfectly and doesn't go in smoothly. The company tried to give me a refund if I didn't give them a bad rep. Don't buy from these corrupt people, they are selling cheap China made garbage."
1,This battery died before a year.,"My G4 Ibook is with me since early 2006 and still works flawlessly. I replaced the original battery with this new one a year ago. Now I know why Apple is charging $129 for a new battery: Quality.This battery is well constructed but did not make it to the year. My original battery lasted about 3 years of heavy use. It's true, as a replacement it's affordable (paid about $50), but it's not worth it. You get the quality you pay for.Will buy a new one from Apple."
2,Product is not as advertised,"Customer service was excellent.However, product didn't fit.Had the company sent me a replacement I would have been impressed, they did not.'We' buy in good faith, but the companies don't have faith in the customer[s]."
5,Works like new,"My computer used to need to be plugged in the entire time, and the battery level would never go above 1%. Whenever I would turn it off and then back on, the date would revert back to 1969. After replacing my battery, I again have a mobile laptop that can hold about 5-6 hours of battery life. I don't have any more problems with the computer remembering the date and time when I turn it off and on. It works nearly like a new laptop again!"
1,uncharged new battery from seller,"LAPTOP BATTERY APPLE IBOOK G4 14"" A1062 A1080 M8665 M8416 M8416G/A M8416Jthis new battery came to me with very low charge and does not fit seamingly to my Apple computer. It took a little doing to install it and the edges of the battery are sticking out and do not form a smooth surface. I would like to return it for anew onebut would like to speak to someone from GSI before I do . Thanks.Rena"
1,unsatisfied,"I a battery from this supplier. The battery charged up once but once the battery ran out the battery would not charge back up. I asked to supplier to exchange the battery but the supplier will not respond to my emails. I would not recommend buying from this supplier.supplier infoTavasBreinigsville, PA"
3,IBook Replacement battery,"The replacement battery had the look and feel of the original equipment, Although the fit was not perfect, it was perfectly serviceable. The price could not be beat,"
5,iBook G4 14 inch Battery,"The Shipping was fast, and it WILL ship with FedEx NOT USPS. The battery life on this battery is about 5 hours, and now I'm finally wireless again! It doesn't quite mach the color for my iBook, But who who cares, as long as it gets the job done thats all that counts! It doesn't really fit that well but it works as it should."
5,Works like a charm.,Works like a charm. Fits into my laptop and I can once again travel charger free.
2,Battery Charge Failure,"After reading the positive reviews for this battery, I took the plunge and ordered one. My original Apple battery was four years old and not holding a charge for more than an hour.I bought the replaceable battery in June, 2010 and by September, 2010, it would not hold a charge PERIOD.I now believe in the saying,""you get what you pay for'"".I am truly disappointed in this product."
5,Great Battery,"For the money, this is hard to beat. I have had this battery for 7-8 months and it is still going strong."
2,Pointless,I placed it on my laptop and it lasted a blink of the eye. Even if it's being charge once unplug it doesn't last at all. No Good.
1,battery,The battery did not charge my computer. I have now taken it out as it stopped charging at all. I now have my old battery back in my computer. I will be purchasing a new battery real soon. Thank you for your concern...I hope this was just a bad battery and the new one I order will work well...
2,Not pleased,The battery runs down VERY quickly. I usually buy from techorbitz but went with this company to save $10. Big mistake. After using for about a month - I had the computer plugged in and was re-charging when I heard a ZZZZZZZ sizzle noise. My original Apple power supply got fried - even melting the wire - and I blame this battery.I cannot recommend it.
2,"Worked for 14 months, then completely died","It looks nice, it fit well, it worked for 14 months and then completely died. I put the 8 year old original battery back in and I am back to having at least a 30 minute charge.If you want something that lasts, skip this unit."
5,Replacement battery...,Recently bought this battery to replace the original ibook battery. It works great and hold the charge as stated. Great product!!!
1,Battery dead in under 1 year,I purchased this battery in 2/2010 and it would not hold a charge past several months. My iBook G4 will still run off the AC but the battery will not charge. I tried several hardware resets (PMU among others) to no avail. This battery simply will not hold a charge. I am very disappointed given that it died before I owned this battery for even a year. I cannot recommend this product to anyone. Lesson learned: buy quality next time.
1,DIED after just 7 months,"I also bought this because of the good reviews and because I didn't want to spend >$120 on a new battery. At first it worked great, but after 5-6 months it started to lose charge very fast. Then it would only partially charge, sporadically recharging in tiny increments. By 7-8 months, it was solidly at 0% and wouldn't recharge. Maybe it's worth it to by from Apple."
2,Less than satisfactory,"Battery is good fit mechanically, however it is difficult to charge & charge disappears rapidly when below 50%. Battery will only charge properly when computer is in full operation."
1,Dead in a month,"Bought this battery to hold off upgrading my laptop for a few more months, but it was dead within a month. I guess it is time to buy that Macbook Pro..."
4,Vecchia edizione di riferimento,"Quando si facevano le cose ad alto livello e bene...Un po' di nostalgia, nonostante qualche voce ormai fuori stile."
5,My son loves this book!,We got a number of code books from the library for my 10-year-old son; this one was so well-done that he wanted to buy his own copy. He has been studying this book and using it to develop his own code system.
4,A Forgotten Rocker From Down Under,"While most Americans have never heard of Stevie Wright, he was once something of a sensation in Australia. He put out some good stuff as a member of the Easybeats - notably ""Friday On My Mind"" - and on his own. Stevie has a voice made for rock. This collection puts together most, but not all, of his better individual efforts - largely drawn from his album ""Hard Road."" (At least one glaring omission: ""Commando Line."") It shows his range from a soft touch on ""Evie, pt. 2"" to the more typical hard rock of ""Hard Road.""In sum, a good CD for those who want a collection of raw Aussie rock from an undeservedly obscure artist."
2,Nice music but track 'clips',"This is a great song; nice and melodic, smooth and very relaxing. However, I have downloaded this track twice from Amazon and both times the track has 'clipping' which has fried out and ruined my front right speaker (I listen to music in 5.1 Dolby Surround). I hope Amazon fixes this for future downloaders because it is a very nice track."
5,Great for Meditation and Reiki,"Fields of Gold is a ""gold mine"" when it comes to total ambiance for meditation, relaxation and Reiki. If you're looking to expand your meditation or professional music library this is a ""must have""!"
5,A must read for the summer and for life,"This great little book will not only inspire, motivate and interest you, it can provide life stories and answers to many of life's questions. Easy to read and thought-provoking, it is one of the few books that can really change your life. If you are looking for inspiration, hope or just seeking truth, this book and its wonderfull and touching real-life stories of how magical life and the presence of a higher power can be in all of us. True, heart-warming tales of coincidence will enlighten and amaze us, therefore providing much hope to anyone who has ever wondered ""Why did this happen to me?"" or ""How does God effect my life?"". In summary, this universal book transcends all cultures, ages, faiths and beliefs. If you ever wondered about the meaning and presence of God in your life, read this book now."
1,TOOO!!!!MUCH,Singers on this CD are o.k. it's just that there is just too much crammed on it. 50 songs on 10 tracks on 1 CD. Nuff said.
5,12 mm x 1.5 pipe plug,Fits cylinder head on GM 3.5 water crossover manifold to block off unused hole in clyinder head that causes leak. Use with AC-Delco 251-2058
2,The Music of Traditional Japan,I just recently purchased the CD for Japanese Shinto Ritual Music at a local book and music store because I enjoy learning about Japan. The music on this CD is not exactly what I thought it would be. The rattles and chanting make Japanese Shinto Rituals sound more like Native American Ritual music. One of the ritual songs sounds like chanting munks! I guess that ritual music doesn't have to sound the the traditional Japanese music that I am used to. At least it was a learning experiance...
3,it's ok...,"I wish I would have spent the extra money on a hairdryer with ions. This product works well, but sometimes the diffuser pops off. I have very long hair and it can also get sucked into the back, and pulls my hair out. I like the hook because I hang it on the side of my vanity, so it stores nicely. I have thin hair, so it seems to dry my hair quickly, 10-15 minutes. To big to travel with. Not bad for the price. Next time I will spend more."
2,Book vs booklet,"I really have a problem with this author. First he tells me how to read his book, then tells me over & over & over again not to share any information in this book with anyone. They must buy their own book. The information in this book is readily available from other sources. It's barely a book at 125 pages and sells for a whooping $29.95. If you write a book about face reading, won't you include a face chart. Not this guy, he wants you to either ask a doctor for one or go to his website to BUY!!!! one. The face chart is a big part of this book to be excluded. I lost respect for Mr. Bezanis very early on. This product is worth $12.95 tops."
4,Interesting,"This book was very interesting but I think I need to reread it several times to understand everything, especially the face reading. I don't know if I'll ever be able to do it. It's not as easy as he makes it seem (to me anyway). I like the book and I really did learn a lot of things but there were still several things I wanted to know and he only touched on a little bit of it. I'll just need to read it again and maybe I'll pick up some more information."
1,Diagnostic Face Reading and the Holistic You,This book is a waste of money. This is information you can easily get anywhere without paying $29.95. There is very little useful information in this book. Note how many times the author adds his review to up the rating of his book. This is a sham.Diagnostic Face Reading and the Holistic You
4,Good seller and good book,This book was not what I expected. I thought it would have page after page photos. Even though it didn't it was still good with lots of interesting and helpful information helpful to anyone who cares about health.
3,"Bizarre, yet.....",".....very intriguing! There's a lot of useful information in this book. Sometimes it reads like an acid trip, but just keep going -- it's worth the ride! My copy is filled with Post-it notes because I frequently refer to many pages over and over."
3,Interesting reading on interesting topics.,"This book is an encyclopedia in one volume, organized alphabetically by topic. It consists of hundreds of articles written by a large number of philosophers. Some of the philosophers write lucidly, eschewing pompous verbiage. Unfortunately, others write in dense jargon with arcane symbolism. I didn't learn much from this volume, because, for the most part, I only understood the articles about subjects upon which I was already informed, whereas I could not understand the articles on unfamiliar topics. I recommend anyone studying this book to have one or more dictionaries of philosophy handy, because much of the trickier vocabulary is not defined in this book or in a standard dictionary. Often, the philosophical arguments and refutations are abridged to the point of incoherence, unless one previously knows the arguments. I did find this volume useful as a review to refresh my memory of philosophical issues."
2,Watch Out After the First Year ... You May Lose Your Data,"I have owned the 300 GB Maxtor external hard drive for about a year now, and just like my 250 GB external hard drive from Maxtor, it is starting to make an occasional grinding noise when data are accessed from it. Maxtor will tell you to run Powermax diagnostic software on it, then you lose all your data (!!!) and then they will mail you another drive if your diagnostic produces the correct error code. But you had better have another drive to backup anything important - because it will all go down the drain in an instant and a new drive getting mailed to you by Maxtor is no consolation. This has happened to me 3 times now with Maxtor drives. The safest thing to do is to buy a Seagate or Western Digital internal hard drive - and use it to backup everything from the Maxtor drives. Maxtors are not reliable!!!"
4,So far so good...,"Just received package last night, set up back-up script, and completed first back up of entire home system. Had no major problems, followed the user manual to the letter. At one point, if the user wants to do the one-touch back-up set-up, pushing the button was supposed to take you to a particular screen, which it didn't. I believe I followed the steps as instructed. Cancelled and did again and it took me to the correct screen. Otherwise worked well, simple set-up overall.Plenty of space, maybe a little pricey at $1 per Gigabyte but my needs will only likely expand with media intensive files and back-up will be essential. So far so good. I will wait and see what routine back-ups etc will do."
1,Maxtor One-Touch Died After 18 Months,"My 300 GB external hard drive crashed after 18 months.When I called Maxtor.com, I found out that they had been bought by Seagate. Furthermore, I was out of warranty and would have to use a data retrieval company if I wanted to try and rescue my data (minimum $1,000).Their warranty is to replace the drive...meaning your data is lost."
1,Blows away the computer,"I'm using this with Windows XP and about 50% of the time, when I press the button to do a backup the Retrospect software they provide blows the computer right out of the water. The blue screen of death appears and the computer crashes. Maxtor has known about this problem for a long time but they won't put out a fix for it."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I have owned a Maxtor One Touch 160gb Hard Drive Firewire/USB drive for over a year. What a piece of crap, every couple weeks it kept crashing on me of course losing all my data. Mator told me to hook it up by USB not Firewire, then told me to buy a New USB Hub, . Between switching cables and everything else it still crashes. So Buyer Beware, buy a nice Western Digital External Hard Drive, I havent had a Western Digital fail on me yet, I'm running 2."
5,A great listening experience,"I love this whole cd--it's a great blend of rock, bluegrass, fiddle, and whatever else they can fit in. This band is great live, and I try to catch them whenever they come into town. Everyone in my house loves it, and we keep making people listen to it. Certainly one of the best CD purchases I've made in awhile!"
3,Arsonist,"The album is just fantastic!It is bluegrass with a wonderful blend of beat and cadence and melodies. My personal favorite song is ""Down the Line"" in the album set. It could be a clasic ballad for those who have lost love but need the optimism that there will still be ""true love down the line!"""
2,The Stone of Light: The Wise Woman - Mediocre reading,"For the Egyptophile, The Stone of Light: The Wise Woman is a disappointment and is lackluster in comparision to other volumes. The story line focuses mainly on the sacred Stone of Light, the forbidden village & the Brotherhood. These craftsmen & artists create the great monuments of ancient Egypt. This in itself could be a fascinating story, but it doesn't pan out.The Wise Woman is one of the central figures, however, there is little emphasis put on her in the book as well. At best it could have been good reading but was uneventful."
3,Feh,"I doubt this review will make much difference one way or the other but I do have a few things to say. Firstly, why the hell do we have to buy these things anyway?! GB games used to come with these. Alright, besides that they're fine. They do protect but cost way too much for something that should be included with the game. Also, I'd rather not have an assortment of colors, I'd much prefer a plain black set of sleeves. Oh well."
1,How do you review GBA Game Cases?,"They are 6 different colors pictured, but you only get clear and blue, and they fit, what more can I say about them. You can store pennies in them, or use them to hold your toenail clippings, or you can...put your games in them.It really stinks that Nintendo makes us but these, they used to come with the older games."
3,"Good protection, but...","I can't open them!!!! These are very hard to reopen after they've been closed. However, they seem to be the only GBA game cases on the market. Hmmm..."
2,THESE USE TO COME WITH THE GAMES,"y do we have to BUY cases now? 1st of all they make games more expensive and now u dont even get a case with them u have to BUY cases for games. i dont get it, y not just give ppl a 2 cent piece of plastic with their game to protect it? but instead they DONT give it to u, then charge alot more than their worth. i gave 2 stars because they DO protect the game after all"
3,"A Bit Dry, but Interesting","Before the U.S.-Mexican War and long before the Civil War, the U.S. Army and Navy had its hands full with the Seminoles in Florida. Charged with the near impossible task expelling the Native Americans who had moved into the swamps of southern Florida, the military had to develop new ways of bringing warfare into the swamps.Buker tells in a relatively dry fashion the changes in naval strategy that occurred during the war and which would end up playing a role in later conflicts throughout the mid 1880s. The culmination of these changes was a coherent strategy for riverine warfare that employed a mix of sailors, soldiers and marines using shallow draft boats that could navigate their way through the swamps. All in all it's an interesting slice of military history."
4,The film is less vulgar.,"The book (containing an very good introduction by Oliver Stone) follows the story of two killers (Mickey & Mallory) who are in their honeymoon. This book is well written but is more vulgar and nasty than Oliver Stone`s movie. I still like the beginning because it`s different from the movie, like almost the entire book."
5,Great Sandles,Very comfortable the very first time I wore them. Made very well. Received them as stated in order. Thanks for having them available.
4,Aerosol shoes for summer,"These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. Cool and comfortable with a flexible sole and toe coverage so they are not too casual at work. The fit is perfect and they can comfortably be worn all day long. Now I'm on the hunt for a brown pair! I dropped one star from the review because they are showing some minor signs of wear (after perhaps 15-20 days of use) and they may not be highly durable, but it is too early to be sure."
1,"Poor Quality, Not an Aerosole","I purchased these shoes thinking that they were exactly like a pair I previously bought a few years ago. After all, they were Aerosoles - a name that I trusted. When I received them, I put them aside. A week later, I decided to store them for next summer. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and was greeted by a strong petroleum odor. Not only that, but the construction of the shoe was entirely changed. Instead of a leather insole, it has a faux suede or microfiber lining(which material burns the bottom of my feet). The sole of the shoe is made of some type of natural colored gum material, rather than the previous black foam/rubber. The shoe has no flexibility across the instep and is uncomfortable. All in all, I am returning the shoes as they are a total waste of money and from the odor may be toxic."
3,WIDE NOT ENOUGHT,"THE SHOE SUPPOSED IS WIDE BUT IS NORMAL, I DONT KNOW WHY THE SIZE IS SO STRECH BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED"
2,waste of money,"I'm taking mine back. Poor transmitter. has to be right next to the radio, and still gets way too much static. Changes station when you turn it off and back on."
2,Fm modulator for MP3 player,It works but there seems to be quite a bit of noise and hiss. It's notcomparable to the signal to noise ratio of a CD player. I suppose youget what you pay for but I expected much better.
5,Nice surprise,"I bought this a few days ago, and I'm impressed. Simple to set up. The manual says the transmitter must be 4-6 ft away from the receiver, but all day today and yesterday, my home stereo has been receiving the fm transmitter's signal from 20 ft away (stereo is on the first floor of my house, and transmitter is hooked up to my laptop on the second floor).There is a slight bit of noise from this distance, but no different than listening to the radio, tuned in nicely. I have a low tolerance for static noise, and this transmitter's signal-to-noise ratio is fine (unless the song is very soft). It was helpful to turn my source signal (my laptop) up, and the stereo amp's volume down.Weird: two of the silver three buttons on the gadget aren't functional; but this seems to be by design. They don't press down, and I guess are for aesthetic value...Anyways, great buy for $13."
5,An Enlightening Christian Fiction,"I loved this book. This author writes about the sensitive Christian stuff, but necessary all the same. I love all his books. Not the average Christian Fiction."
4,Good premise,"I picked this up expecting to see Bill's version of Richard Matheson's ""What Dreams May Come"". I was definitely wrong there. This is nothing like that book, though both deal with someone losing someone close to them and wanting to contact them beyond the grave. The title of this one is a little misleading. The whole ""soul-tracking"" part doesn't really come until almost the end of the book. There are few surprises in this one except for the death of a major character that I never saw coming in a million years. Sets itself up nicely for a sequel though. As a matter of fact, that's probably the most redeeming part of this book: the plot thread left open begging for a second book (which I'd buy without hesitation). Bill's writing is tight here and keeps you along for the most part, but it does seem to drag just a little in parts. Still, when it takes off, it takes off and you will have a hard time finding a place to put the book down. Recommended."
5,A search for Truth,"Bill Myers is back in his supernatural element with Soul Tracker. His writing not only explores the ""what-if's"", but causes his reader to think about deeper spiritual truths. David Kauffman is set up to believe he is communicating with his daughter, Emily, who supposedly committed suicide. His quest is to discover what really happened and where she is -- heaven or hell. Through a virtual reality program, David is able to communicate with Emily and visit heaven and hell. But is any of this real? With his masterminded creativity, Bill Myers is able to depict a very vivid heaven, and equally realistic hell. What are the consequences of our passions and the choices they prompt us to make? And just as David is willing to probe the horrors of hell and even death for his child, to what extent will our Heavenly Father go to reveal Himself to His seeking children? Don't miss the first of what I pray will be many in a Soul Tracker series. You will come away touched and very likely changed."
2,"It's ok, but...","This CD is almost the same as ""Night at the Casbah"" which I already own. Same songs except one, just in a different order. Really don't like it for dancing. Too folksy. Guess if you knew actual folk dances it would be ok."
5,My boy loves it!,"The Five Little Monkeys books are classics. My wife and I bought four of them and our boy and he loves them. In this edition, the mother is tired of the junky family car and decides to sell it. Her five little bundles of joy decide to spiff it up to sell it. They have a run in with the crocodiles again but all ends up well in the end. It's good for a young child who is learning to read and the artwork is well done. I highly recommend this book."
3,Monkeys are Funny so the Book is Too,"I thought that this was a funny book that would be great for young children. It is a fun and easy book to read, with great pictures. The pictures do a wonderful job of showing what is happening in the story, making it easier for young kids to follow along. The monkeys are a good choice of character for the story, because every little kid loves monkeys. I recommend this book for any young kid who wants to read and laugh at the same time."
1,Read before you buy...,"Please go to Target's website and read the reviews there before you buy this table set. Every single person who posted feedback had problems with the tables, ranging from them being completely broken in transit to severely scratched and dented."
1,Bogus copy,Don't buy this edition: it is a bogus and poorly made copy.They were even too cheap to include a proper character set for the Greek and Aramaic.
3,Well Made,"Very nice and fun ""Theme Party"" cd, you can sing along in between your ""Biers"". I enjoy it on occasion and it does receive some replays from time to time."
1,no credibility,"I would put more stock in Pat Robertson waxing poetic on the joys of homosexuality than I would in anything this man has to say with regard to faith, morality or anything else. He is a flagrant anti-Semite and often ill-informed to boot. For more information on his past comments visit http://www.pinenet.com/~rooster/media.html"
1,no credibility,"The idea of Mr. Pippert lecturing on ethics would be laughable if it weren't so downright frightening. He has absolutely no claim to any moral high ground whatsoever. His anti-Semitic comments are legion and vicious. I can think of many more qualified men to postulate on our nations moral obligations. Asking him to dictate our morality is like asking David Duke to lecture on racial tolerance. It is both an insult and an exercise in stupidity. For information on some of his past comments and his personal brand of ""ethics"" visit http://www.pinenet.com/~rooster/media.html"
5,THis Mix CD is AWESOME,"You can't ask for a better set of artists.............. Terry Francis, Jay Tripwire, Tony Thomas and Vinyl Assassins? You can't beat that. This is definately two cd's of quality house music!! I am so happy to have this mix set. A big thanks to Wilson Santos."
5,"Certified, slap-yo-mama, BANGER!!!!!","I first got it in 2004 when it first came out, and I have had to buy it THREE times since then because they seem to get away from me, or I lose one...won't happen again since I've ripped them to my media player, but I would buy it 50 MORE times if I have to.Wilson is one of those DJs that just doesn't get enough shine, and I hope that changes soon. You can listen to these albums over and over and it only gets better each time!Highly, highly recommended. And to the person who talks about Danny at Vinyl?!?!?! Maaaaaaaaaan, I lived up in there and you are so right. Perhaps that's another reason why I love this album so much. It reminds me of the best times I've had in my LIFE (like the soundtrack to Winter Music Conference '04, and to falling in love with a guy as crazy as I am LOL)!Don't sleep on this any longer. That is ALL."
2,Better Options Available,"While this book includes a wealth of information, I would consider it more of a guide than an interactive book for children. It is written primarily from the adult perspective and includes pages of suggestions for activities, readings and discussions. Some worksheets are added in each chapter. Overall, I did not find this as helpful as other publications."
5,great value!,my son loves this combine. comparing the cost with a 'john deere' combine - 80 bucks! this has moving parts and is built well - don't worry about not getting a good product because it cheaper than others -----great deal!
2,Pick a different truck,"I have purchased many other trucks for my grandson and I was very disappointed with the quality of this one. The plastic is very flimsy, and I doubt that it will hold up to playing, if it is played with at all. The front part has been slipping out of place from the first day, and has to be re-positioned by an adult over and over again.Of all the trucks I've purchased in the past two years, I think the Bruder cement mixer is the best. My 4 year old grandson and his 2 year old sister play with it mercilessly, and it has held up extremely well. You can fill it with sand outside, or lentils or other small beans or oatmeal inside and it cranks the material out like a real cement mixer. It's a little expensive, but a far better purchase than this lexion."
4,great,It works great and is large enough to let the boys push it across the carpet. Takes up a little room but they like it
3,No instructions,"The Lexion itself is neat, just what our grandson wanted, BUT, there were no instructions or decent illustrations for installing the railings and ladders."
3,"Great sink, BAD drain basket!!!","When we remodeled our kitchen we did not cut any corners, and ordered the Blanko sink ina dark brown. It is working fine, but they put in such cheap drain baskets that they letfood go through the large holes in them and then they will not hold water. So frustratingthat they would cheapen the baskets for such a nice sink!!!"
4,bella voce,"This is a beautiful album with popular and operatic favourites. The standout track is the Flower duet from Lakme, where Katherine is joined by Dame Kiri te Kanawa, who sounds amazing at 64 years of age!"
3,Brilliant voice,"Katherine has a very beautiful soprano voice, but it lacks what Callas had. Those of you who appreciates Callas will know what I mean."
1,Sarah Brightman's mini-me,"Half of the content of this album has been originated by Sarah Brightman.Katherine Jenkins simply transposed the songs to lower keys to suit her 3rd rate mezzo sopran.Apart from her nice ""behind"" on the cover Katherine Jenkins has nothing to offer but remakes from Sarah Brightman's repertoire.Stay away from this copy cat and buy the original."
5,The best pens...period,The BIC Grip Roller is the best pen I've ever used. I got one free from a local bank and had been trying to buy more through office stationers (like OfficeMax and Office Depot) but nobody had them in stock. So I bought 30 of them (and may buy 30 more) through Amazon. Love this pen and you will love it too.
5,Finally found this pen!!,"We, too, received these pens as part of a marketing promotion. I have been carrying around an empty pen so I will not forget to keep looking for a place to purchase them. My teen-age son loves them!A great buy."
5,At last - Sensitive Skin + Effective Deodorant,"I have spent hundreds of dollars over the years on deodorants - searching for something that my skin could handle AND actually works. At last! Fa Sensitive is so gentle I can use it every day, even twice a day after a mid-day shower. This is a first, and I have tried EVERYTHING. I live in Texas and have a job that puts my in and out of my car - so when I say it works - IT WORKS! It never stains - even my white shirts have remained pristine over the years. I don't think it completely prevents sweating (at least not in my world of 109 Fahrenheit in 70% humidity) but it does completely prevent odor. Great product."
1,LOOK DIFFERENT FROM EXPECTED,"Picture of this comforter is different from it arrived. Colors are dull, not vibrant color like in this picture."
4,"This set does not have gold, but it's beautiful!","I received my new bedding set today. This set is a different color pattern than the one in the picture. This set is burgundy with dark wet sand trim. Not gold at all. Still, I love it. The comforter is beautiful, and of excellent quality. It's very thick. The matching shams are lovely. The skirting is fairly flimsly, but alright. I'm definitely keeping it! This set matches my sheets perfectly .........a coffee colored set I purchased on Amazon a few weeks back. Check my other reviews for matching sheets!"
1,WASTE,"Watch claimed to be water resistant to 100M. This watch was dead after about 2 mins in the water. Again, probably a fake. No one will work on it."
2,Failed watch for Bolova,I bought my Bolova Marine Star Chronograph watch less than a year ago in December of 2010 and had to change the battery on it in the second month. Since then the watch continually stops for no reason at all. This has been extremely disappointing since I thought the watch looked like a high end watch. I don't feel like I could ever buy this brand of watch again. I never had problems with my Seiko watches
1,Water damaged - twice,"As of now I've had two of this model and both have been subjected to water damage within one year of the purchase date. The watch is rated to be water resistant to 100 meters, however mine were damaged in less than 2 meters.I like the looks of the watch, but cannot say with confidence that it is well engineered nor manufactured for quality. This watch does not live up to the Marine Star name. I would not recommend this watch if you have any desire to wear this in the water."
5,Beautiful Watch,"Its a great looking watch, it does everything you would ever want a watch to do and at the price you cant beat it. if you get it you wont be disappointed"
5,Something a little different,"Purchased this to add a little color to my otherwise black and silver watches. It is nicely put together and the blue of the face and bezel are very deep and rich looking. I agree with other reviews that there is just enough gold. Per my ruler it is 41mm in diameter from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock, including the unidirectional bezel. On the Amazon image showing the scale it shows about 38mm. Took it to a watch store and had them take out some links so I can now enjoy it. Highly recommend it if you want something that is a little different but does not shouth out 'hey look at me' too much. One nice touch was that when I opened the box it was not already running so the battery has not been running while sat on a shelf in the warehouse."
1,Great watch,I get a lot of compliments about how great the watch looks. It keeps perfect time. There are two very minor flaws to the watch. There is a 24 hour dial which is blocked when the minute or hour hand is in the range of 2 to 4. Adjusting the band to fit your wrist is not covered in the manual. It looks like screws but no screw driver would work. Turns out that the screws are just pins that need to be pounded out.
1,Yikes! Are there any real engineers out there?,"Chandrakasan is unfortunately a member of the large group of academics who make a career out of publishing articles and books, despite not understanding much of their subject matter. This book's contents are either trivial (the benefits of voltage scaling and minimization of switched capacitance), incorrect, or have been well known and applied for years (for example, by Swiss CMOS watch designers). As a working engineer in the field, I find this book practically offensive."
1,A Weisberg knockoff,"If you are looking for the soundtrack from ""Deliverance,"" this 'aint it. The Deliverance soundtrack (available on Amazon) was actually a reissue of an album called ""New Dimensions in Bluegrass,"" by Eric Weisberg and Marshall Brickman, which is considered one of the all-time great banjo records. It also featured great fiddling by Gordon Terry and the legendary Clarence White on guitar.Whoever did this album apparently tried to rip off that classic album. The songs are nearly the same, but the musicianship is abysmal. What an insult, it's like listening to a bad cover band trying to pass themselves off as the Beatles. Buyer Beware."
2,A Trojan Horse,"Up until Bill Keith came along banjo players had never really been able to play fiddle tunes note for note.They were stuck playing part of the melody but not all of it. When I saw this CD I thought it was a reissue of Eric Weissberg's and Marshall Brickman's ""New Dimensions in Bluegrass And Banjo"". The title of this CD says ""Dueling Banjos"" yet it really isn't what I would call a primarily ""Banjo"" album. It sounds like many of the city bluegrass bands of the sixties just not the best ones(Greenbriar Boys,New York Ramblers, and Keith and Rooney). The sound is somewhat muffled in my opinion."
3,"Challenging, heart-pumping workout!","Let me start by saying I own Lauren Brooks' other 2 volumes of Ulitimate Body Sculpt and Conditioning (green cover and blue cover), so I'm not new to her style of instruction. Overall, I love her kettlebell workouts. However, this one seems a be a bit over the top. Many of the workouts are done with two kettlebells simultaneously. You can ""modify"" the workout to use just one kettlebell, but that kind of defeats the purpose in using this DVD (if you really want an EXTREME challenge). Also, many parts of the workout require the TRX suspension system which I don't own, and have no plans on purchasing. Had I realized how much TRX and double-bell routines were in this video, I wouldn't have ordered it. Also, my DVD skips a bit. I am considering sending it back."
2,We need a serious book about the border situation,"Even though I have never heard of this author, I bought the book because it looked interesting enough. However, this book was not worth the discounted price that I paid for it. Clearly the author is working on the side of the racist crackpots out there and is not looking at the reality of the border situation. He seems to have spent some time with the fringe border vigilante-militia types and has obviously sided with them. We need a serious book about the border situation as is today and unfortunately this one isn't it."
1,a terrible book,"I purchased this book from amazon in 2010. This book is one of the worst books that I have ever read. It was not related much to the ship Bismark. It was more of a novel. Much of the book included the experiences of two naval personnel that were not really part of the factual Bismark story. Sexually graphic writing was not appropriate for any children. When the writer eventually got around to the Bismark ship, It was not accurate. After this, I bought the book ""The sinking of the Bismark"" by William Shirer. I will rate Mr. Shirer's book as ""excellent""."
1,Good paint except for paint splatter,This paint 'splatters' as it is sprayed.I shook the can vigorously for 2-3 minutes to make sure the paint was mixed.I sprayed the paint and it splattered everywhere.I shook the can vigorously for 2-3 more minutes.I sprayed the paint and it splattered everywhere.Temperature for the day was 80 degrees or above.I submitted a customer support question to the Dupli-Color website.I did not get a reply.I would avoid this paint.
3,"Series is great, Amazon's transmission not so great",The production values and acting are first rate.I paid for HD but picture quality is not that good.Closed caption would also add to our enjoyment.
2,It's OK,"I purchased it because I loved the ""Tudors"" and was hoping this would be similar. I really can't pin down what I don't like about it but it just didn't cut it."
3,ok,"There is something mysterious to me about what makes a teleplay great. This series covers a period of history that is fascinating. The story it tells is fascinating. Many of the performances are truely inspired. I am glad I watched it, but there is something wrong with it that means I won't go back and watch it again.For me that is the deciding factor between ok and really good. Repeat watchability.I don't really know what it is that makes it less than it could have been. Maybe we should have gotten to know and care about the family a little before the intrique started. Its the difference between watching what happens and actually caring what happens - thats the thing.The Cesare character is flat, wooden, and at times painful to watch. Lucrecia gets better and better as the story moves forward. I rather like Jeremy Irons performance. There are so many gem-like performances in the rest of the cast I couldn't list them all."
2,No Close Captions!,"Probably my mistake but is hard to see if CC is included.The series is okay, not great, but okay..."
1,Very boring Borgias,"This series is incredibly boring and stilted. Jeremy Irons looked like he was bored to tears acting his part.Very disappointing, especially after the recent series of "" the tudors"""
1,Don't waste your money or time on this movie.,This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your time or money on it. I didn't even finish watching it.
1,"Borgias, jeremy irons",Watched 1st season on Showtime. It was boring and anti-climatic. I would rather watch Breaking Bad which is real drama if you seek something to watch.
5,great movie,for those who are strong catholics dont view this ..gives you some thoughts on how things where done back then...
5,Brilliant,"The costuming and scenery in this HBO presentation is absolutely marvelous. Jeremy Irons leads a talented cast in this portrayal of the Borgia's. It ranks up there with that other HBO presentation ""Rome"". It doesn't get any better than this folks! You will love it! I have already preordered season two."
2,Boring Borgias,"I was soooo looking forward to this....I fell asleep not once, but twice during the first episode. Second episode I turned off halfway through. This series should have been at least as good as the Tudors, but alas, there is absolutely no reason to care about any of the characters. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the scenery and costumes are magnificent."
1,BORGIAS,"It seems that I am in the minority in my low opinion of Seasons 1 & 2. However, the only reason I gave one star is the fact that the sets were good and everyone must have shown up for work every day. While some may be fascinated by the machinations of the pope and his family, I found them rather repetitious - one scene for evil, followed by the violence of the times, then we have all the raw sex. Did anyone ever do anything in moderation? I am an American, but think the BBC is far superior in their presentations - the subtlety plays a major part in their success. I found the acting wooden - Jeremy Irons always looked like he should have been in the Intensive Care Unit. However, the straw that broke the vile camel's back was one man urinating on another!"
1,Made out about every third word.,"I wish I could tell you whether this is good or bad, but I don't know. English actors, as a whole, are far superior to american actors, but they have a tendency to mumble. This set does not contain subtitles so you are on your own. Will some tell the sound men that they need to turn the volume up or tell the actors to speak louder."
2,Jeremy does not save it,"What's wrong with the British? Why am I sure that, had HBO done the Borgias, they'd have wrung it not only for raunch, but also for torment, suspense, vivid emotion. There is something so anodyne about British story-telling. Correct but cold. Precise but clunky. Give me slick any day. Manipulate me emotionally: make me larf, make me cry, glue me to the sceen. US TV achieves this consistently in recent series. The British just don't get it.Jeremy Irons is delicious of course and, at some moments, almost saves the show. As he is anointed pope he staggers into the arms of his son, overcome by what he mistakenly believes might be his own holiness. He is mannered, but in subtle, riveting ways.I bought series one because of Jeremy. Sadly, even he can't tempt me to finish it."
4,Bloody and Lusty!,"Well, I'm sure the Popes, the Borgias, and 1/2 of Italy are rolling in their mutual graves (and maybe in others!) about this portrayal of life in that era. It's great to be able to film something like this because there is no one who can say that they didn't do or say the things portrayed."
1,This blu-ray doesn't support resume,"The program content is very good, what I have managed to get through. But I doubt I'll ever have the patience to keep fast forwarding to where I left off. Sorry, I feel that I have to have many pauses to simulate commercial breaks, so only watch a part of any particular episode at one sitting, so resume is important to me. I don't think I'll even have the will to put disk 2 in the machine.Many blu-rays do support resume. Any program this long, with multiple episodes, should have resume built in or it's not really watchable. I googled ""resume and blu-ray"" before writing this, and it is not a technical difficulty like it was in the earliest days of blu-ray; it is, instead, a design decision. Or, just not really caring about the customers. I'm only going to buy blu-rays from now on if I can determine that they have the resume function enabled. And, no, I don't want to manually enter bookmarks. It's not a book."
3,it would be great,"There is something mysterious to me about what makes a teleplay great. This series covers a period of history that is fascinating. The story it tells is fascinating. Many of the performances are truely inspired.

1,Not a Rome or Game of Thrones at its best day,"I'm and advid fan of all historically based shows, such as Rome, even though most of the script is totally fiction. However, I grew bored with The Borgias. The plot was lacking and I found myself napping after a few episodes. I understand that some shows take awhile before becoming its best... Game of Thrones is one example of a series with a very slow start but I'm in love with the show nevertheless. The Borgias ...dull even at its best moments. I don't see how so many gave this show 5 stars."
5,Great Show and Great DVD,"I love this show. The acting is fantastic, the writing is great. I know they stray from history, but the story is so good you don't really mind. Also I understand that some of the history is muddled and they way they write these characters is really entertaining. I cannot give this show anymore praise. Fantastic!"
3,The Borgias,I got this because I loved the Tudors. I thought I was getting the Borgias with my Amazon Prime but paid .99 cents for one episode of season 1. I thought I was buying the whole season 1 for .99 cents. I will not buy more. It may be good but was not as good as The Tudors.
4,Borgia v. The Borgias,"I prefer this series to the ""Borgia"" series by Tom Fontana because I prefer this ""pope"". Both series have good points but Jeremy Irons is much more credible (maybe just the English accent, which is not even an Italian accent). Both series should be reviewed side by side; I bought this one on Amazon and the other is available through Netflix but both are worth watching."
2,There is a much better version...,"Borgia: Faith and Fear by Tom Fontana surpasses this version by miles.While the casting of the John Doman in Fontana's version is a serious downfall, the rest of the cast and the sheer passion of the show more than compensate.Jeremy Irons is a marvelous actor, but somehow this just does not work. Skip this version and watch the European series.Infinitely better."
3,AVERAGE,"I watched the 1st season and like it. A friend recommended Borgia; faith and fear. I watched Borgia: faith and fear. I was in awe. I do recommend this Borgia's, however if you enjoy this, YOU WILL ENJOY BORGIA: FAITH AND FEAR 10 X more."
3,Kind of a let down...,"After the immense satisfaction of The Tudors, The Borgias had a lot to live up to... and it was only mediocre in that. Jeremy Irons is awesome, as always, but the storyline just doesn't draw you in, like with ol' King Henry. Production value is high, but I just wish The Borgias had been better than it turned out to be."
5,Excellent!,"This tale of intrigue,seduction and naked lust for power is a fine demonstration of first class casting, a well-crafted screenplay and utterly convincing acting. It rises far above the level of the usual television drama and sits in the company of the great dramatic productions that gave us Scofield in ""A Man for All Seasons"" and Burton and O'Toole in ""Becket."""
3,Borgias Season One,A little mundane. This was interesting from learning about the situation of an early Pope in old Italy. Learning about characters I had only slightly come to know was good.I bought it on a stranger's recommendations at the end of Season 2. I expect it to pick up when the next season DVDs appear.
3,The Borgias Season 1,"the Borgias was easy to watch on my Kindle Fire. It saved me from downloading all the shows to my kindle. The color was great, everything was good except for the acting, maybe it wasthe writing. Maybe it was the sets. I don't know but I was disappointed."
3,"Irons Keeps ""The Borgias"" Afloat","A lavish historical soap opera made palatable by Jeremy Irons' splendid performance as Rodrigo Borgia/Pope Alexander VI. The British actor channels his inner Karloff to memorable effect - no one in the cast comes close to matching him. Nine ruthless episodes with plenty of gratuitous sex and violence. ""The Borgias"" (2011) does not represent outstanding television, but it's immensely watchable."
4,Showtime's best,"I personally really enjoy this series, however it is not for everyone. For example, my husband doesn't like it because to him it ""feels like school."" I think it's a lavish production that is very well-acted and reminds me of The Tudors. Having said that, I was a bit disappointed by the Season 2 opener. I always appreciated the fact that The Borgias was more tasteful than many other 'period' shows. At the beginning of season 2, they felt like it was necessary to add more naked females. Oh well. At least my husband will be complaining less!"
2,Meh - the BBC series is much better,"After seeing this show receive awards I was eager to watch it. Unfortunately, I watched the BBC version instead, and then watched this version, and was sadly dissapointed. I usually love Jeremy Irons, but his performance in this was terrible. Save yourself some time and watch the BBC miniseries about the Borgias instead."
1,"Appalling, Awful, and, Most of All, Boring","All I watched was the first episode of season one. That was enough. The most exciting part was when the poor monkey ate poison and even that almost put me to sleep.Very early in the episode it was apparent that the characters were going to be uninteresting, the dialogue overblown, ridiculous and amateurish, the acting horrendous, and the tension and pacing nonexistent.I don't watch series such as this to experience historical accuracy. I watch to be entertained. Its accuracy was not the problem. The show is simply terrible. Borgia and everyone in the show were bores.If you want to see a great series with wonderful characters and acting, I recommend The Tudors. Stay far away from The Borgias."
1,Very Disappointed!,"Borgias, 1st Season. This DVD CLEARLY states that it is closed captioned, I have 3 highly rated DVD players, OPPO, Play Station, and a Pioneer and none would play the captions. I am hearing impaired so these DVDs were unwatchable for me. This is the 1st item that I have bought from Amazon that I have not been pleased with."
4,Beautiful,This isn't a book about garnishing-- that takes volumes in itself. its a book about style. Great ideas for simple touches to make a beautiful presentation.
2,leaky,I received a refurbished Krups as a gift and the ice cream turned out delicious but after only 3 times of using it the seal around the freezing cylinder broke allowing the water from inside to leak out. I followed the instructions on storing and washing to the tee so i can see no reason why this happened beside poor design.
3,season 5 dog the bounty hunter,I love dog the bounty hunter i got this dvd thinking it would be more of the newer episodes but it wasnt it was some more of the old ones''they say its season five but the episodes are during the 2nd 3rd season''if i had one wish with the people that selected the episodes i would wish that they put all the episode's on the dvd''because they dont always pick the good onesas much as i love the dog and his family i dont think i will buy any more of the dvd's im tired of all the old episodes''there was some really good episodes on the 4th and 5th season that were not on the dvd's
3,Major let down,I have all of the Dog the Bounty Hunter's Dvd's. I was so excited to get the new one only to be let down. I thought they would have new episodes on it or newer then these older ones. I hope they make a new dvd with new episodes on it.
3,"Same Dog, (mostly) different season.","1. Some of the episodes are repeats from other dvds.2. NO special features, nada, zip. At least some of the other dvds tried (like including a picture gallery).I wish they would include more episodes - I don't have Tivo so this is the only way I can catch up. I know there are more episodes than what they include on the dvds, so it feels cheap when they include repeats of episodes that were on previous discs."
4,Long live the Dog!,Have waited what seems a very long time for this shorter DVD release.Just some highlighted episodes of Series 5. Would have preferred the usual best of the series.Used to come in 3 disc format with much more special features about the family.Series 5 and 6 have lots more episodes.Season 6 Available to watch on Sky Bravo channel in the UK.Still haven't lost interest in the series after all this time. Highly recommend.
3,Dog the Bounty Hunter,"Baby Lissa is all grown up and doing her thing! It's entertaining when you feel like the bad guys are getting away with, well, just being bad."
4,very very nice,"It was very very nice, but a little disappointing because it wasn't a full season, but picked shows. It was have been nice to have a full season."
1,Not What I Expected...,"When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier. I did not find that at all. This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all ""I'm writing to help others"" book of caring and honesty. Her husband must be one great guy! I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years. I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment."
1,Difficult,"We bought this for our 11 year old daughter. She is very crafty and imaginative. However, this loom was a nightmare. She tried it twice, and was on the verge of tears with frustration. I think it will end up at Goodwill!"
2,ok but not too sturdy,I had to help my daughter make native american jewerly for school so we bought this. It served its purpose but I won't use it again. The string for the bracelets is very flimsy and fell apart. The beads are very small and the product overall is cheaply made. You need to use a sewing needle to thread the beads so this is not something for young kids.
3,bead selection inadequate,This loom for children should have a selection of beads separated into colors (for easy use) and possibly larger beads. At least there should be a reference as to what beads to buy and where to buy them.
5,Great for Beadweaving!,"I copy portions of works of art from the Great Masters and turn them into Jewelryor amulet bags.All I needed was the loom. I bought suitable thread and size 15/0 beads for my work separately.I can imagine it being super easy with larger beads.Being portable, this loom is perfect for me."
4,Bead Loom Review,"This was exactly what I was looking for. I haven't had one since I was a kid and I wanted to get back into loom beading. Very simple design, great for beginners."
4,Summer fun,Bought my girls two over the summer for something different to do and they made nice bracelets. They really enjoyed using these.
4,Muy chulo!,"Es muy entretenido!! Y util!! Me gusto mucho!Es bueno para que las niñas aprendan la fabricación de sus propias pulseras hechas por ellas mismas!, tambien sirve para los adultos, podemos ser muy creativos con las cuentas!"
2,For serious cooks only!,"The recipes look good-but this book is for serious cooks only. Not only do you have to know what a Dutch oven is, but you have to own one in order to prepare several of the recipes. There are very few recipes that those of us with Pyrex and microwave ovens can adapt to use. It only covers a few antioxidents, also-just the obvious ones."
2,not the best,"I purchased this product many times, and the nuts are OK. I recently found the same exact product from Fiddyment Farms -- and Fiddyment's nuts are significantly superior, at about the same price. Amazon should consider carrying Fiddyment Farms's product."
3,"A fair book, but the trilogy reeks.","This book was a fair book, but Niles' writing skills leave a lot to be desired. Niles has an interesting but limited vocabulary - try tallying up the word ""spoor"" throughout the novel, for instance. The foreshadowing evident in the book is also anything but subtle - it's an art that Niles appears not to have mastered. The plot was fairly intriguing (if predictable); i was somewhat curious to see who was going to croak and how (not if - the heroes have to have a glorious victory) the young prince Tristan was going to vanquish his foes. This is the best book of the trilogy, but it's not so good that it's worth putting up with the other two."
3,Best Erika Koeth CD capture so far,"Good quality recording, clean. Best CD Capture of Erika Koeth's solo I've heard so far."
3,"Computer program, Not a Movie","This item was advertised as a DVD, when in fact it is a CD to be used on a computer. It will only work on older operating systems and not the new Windows 7 or 8. I had purchased it years ago for the PC, and bought this based on the description saying it was a DVD. It has small Quicktime video clips, and that's all in the video format. It wasn't worth the cost to send it back, so I kept it. If you have an older PC, it is a good documentary, but don't buy it if you're expecting more than 20-30 second video clips."
4,Murder and Mint Tea,"Katherine Miller, a 65-year-old retired nurse, loves her soothing mint tea. After a serious fall leaves her with a broken leg, her son Andrew takes it upon himself to rent out the bottom floor apartment of her house to Rachel Rogers and her two children, Tim and Susie. That's when the neighborhood begins going downhill.Rachel is a mean woman who loves her self and what she can get from men. She doesn't care if they are married or not. There are so many people who dislike Rachel ...I found this book to be very engaging and filled with the most wonderful cast of characters that you will love, especially Katherine who is gutsy even at 65 years of age."
3,its ok,it isnt exactly what i thought i needed to get my cell signal better. i called wilson and they told me it wasnt exactly the antennna i needed
1,Product Description a LIE!!,"System Includes: 3 watt dual band 40dB gain cellular repeater (DA4000MR) * 18 external 9dB gain omni-directional antenna ( 288-PW ) Internal 9 dB gain directional antenna ( 426-PW ) 30' of DA240 cable for external antenna ( 240-30NM ) 15' of DA240 cable for internal antenna ( 240-15NM ) 1?14 threaded mount ( DM194 ) 1?14 threaded mounting ferrule ( F114 ) 12 VDC power converter ( DP515 ) 110 VAC power supply ( DP255 ) * Not sold individually; only available as part of a system.Well that's the LIE they post.System includes: Nothing but the internal Antenna.No repeater.No External Antenna.No Cables.No VDC power converter.And to boot, is states, ""not sold individually."" So WTF!!Thought maybe the package wasn't complete, and returned it for replacement.Nope, got the same crap.1 Antenna and a couple of screws to mount it, and that's it.Pretty useless as delivered.Pretty criminal in their deceit."
1,Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED,"The description states that the item included an external antenna and repeater, along with some cable. The package received actually contains just the dome antenna, nothing else."
4,Academy MiG-27 Flogger D,"This product is one of the cheapest on the market. It comes with a small pilot as well, so it made this especially more attractive. My first model kit, this is pretty well made, considering the cost, which often is otherwise indicative of a poor finish. The parts fit well, and the swing-wings move well too. It does feel a little lose, though, but a good product over all. I just wish I had an option of having the external tanks for wings be detachable, so that I could swing it into swept back position whenever I wanted to. Only thing to be careful of, during construction are the wheels. The MiG-27's L-shaped design is unusual, and allows for hard landing in reality. But the model is not that robust. I had to use Araldite to fix it, along with plasticine to keep it in position for long, till the epoxy was set. A great model to start learning from, IMHO!"
4,They are what they are,"...and when you need them, you need them. We inherited the vacuum, and found we needed to order the bags. Best of all, they came with a micro-filter, which we found we would need every six bag changes. Everything is well."
1,Poor Clasp,I bought this bracelet for christmas. it lasted one day the clasp would not stay closed. and part of the clasp broke off. not worth your money
4,Mansun does it again,"After a year and a half of near silence, Mansun comes back with a powerful 2CD single set. The title track, ""I Can Only Disappoint U"" is classic Mansun: down lyrics that betray the song's upbeat exterior. If you're a fan, pick it up NOW. If you're not, check it out for a great new experience."
4,Evi's little helper!,"Very nice, handy, working exactly as described(charges, connects to computer, syncs your camera etc)fits in my case with the rest of the stuff or in my pocket!VERY useful on the road and @ home,I have been using it with my cellphone too.I'd give it a 5 if its design was futuristic/elegant!"
5,Great buy!!!,"I ordered de White/Metallic Navy model and they're awsome, very light and comfortable and what can I say about the design... they're great!!! I'll buy another pair for sure"
5,The BEST book on modern probability,"a) Well organized!b) Covers a broad range of topics e.g. measure theory, stochastic processes, martingales, Markov processes, stochastic calculus, SDE...and much more!! You can find in it almost all branches of probability!c) Proofs are short, efficient and interesting, but you have to fill in many details. This gives you a good training!!d) Results are usually stated in the most general forme) It requires a strong backgroung in real analysis and functional analysise) Very very few typos!"
2,Music GONE!,"They took the cheap way out and didn't license most of the great 80s tunes as heard when the show originally aired. In some places it's obvious, like when Marshal introduces a Minor Threat song while DJing at the school radio station and they play some generic dreck. Other times, it's more subtle, like every scene in the diner originally had music playing in the background, and now there's just nothing."
5,"groundbreaking tv show ,","on a much higher level than almost anything ever done about high school . its also funny as hell and done at at a time where most high shool characters were student body president or head cheerleader, now most teen characters are cooly reflective outsiders. This show is long over due but is arguably the best comedy about TEEN life ever"
3,"Moments of Brilliance, but inconsistant","With the creative team behind the ORIGINAL Saturday Night Live, this charming often witty show came out. Having to break the network enforced conventions, like a pathetic laugh track through the first 3/4 of the series, not to mention hammy overacting and cliche characters, there are some true genius moments in several of the episodes. The ""glasses"" speech in the second episode is one of the heaviest darkest things ever on network TV, and the Bill Murray episode is wonderful. The problem with so many writers and so little time, makes it hard to be consistent, and the quality definitely slacked near the end of the series. But I'm holding it against NON Teen shows, and that's really not fair. In the category the show was in, it by FAR outshines the garbage released now for teens. From the 90's on, horribly written, manufactured, unfunny shows with NOTHING to say like Saved By The Bell and California Dreams put Square Pegs on a Citizen Kane level."
4,So 80s,One of my favorite tv shows of the 80s. It only lasted one season but what a season it was. So funny! :) I highly recommend it.
5,It works,Had a cold for 1 month and it got better 24 hours after first dose and was almost gone after second dose.
2,Warning: New formula,"The old Cold-MD, was great. You take one or 2 pills per day, and it STOPS you from GETTING a cold.The New formula is a RAPID-RECOVERY formula.I would start taking the old formula about 4 days before i went on a trip, then one before I got on the plane.I never got a cold on any trip since i have been taking the old formula.Well, I guess they decided that taking 6 pills a day to RECOVER, was more profitable then taking 1-2 pills a day to PREVENT a cold.And their new formula does not seem to work very well for me. I'm going back to Theraflu.I am very upset with this company, now."
5,A welcome addition to your Risk Management library,"This book by Prof. Solojentsev ( sometimes spelled as Solozhentsev ) contains an illuminating take on his pioneering approach to assessing risk in Finance using methods originating from Engineering and Operations Research. A world-renowned expert with over 40 years of experience in the area of risk mamangement, the author applies his the logic and probabilistic method to assessing and managing systemic and idiosyncratic risk in banking and finance using expert estimates and knowledge-based forecasting of catastrophic events. The layout of the book is clear and concise, its exposition replete with examples that will appeal to experts and students of the subject alike. I highly recommend Prof. Solojentsev's monograph to both academics and practitioners interested in Financial Risk Management."
4,"Useful collection, great octet","This is a useful collection of some of Schubert's less known chamber pieces, plus the popular octet. The music is nice but not top-drawer schubert. the performances are all good, the sound is mostly good. The octet is splendid in all respects."
5,A Must Have if Considering SLU,"This book is an excellent insider guide into both the university and the city of Saint Louis. The facts in this book are given by students, so it ultimately is the best guide into how SLU really is. I definitely recommend the book if you are considering SLU or even attending. I have learned so much about the university that I would otherwise would not have learned by reading this book. And it is by no means a boring read.... I found the university more desirable after reading it."
1,"badly produced,",it would appear that his C D has been reproduced directly from an old recording and not from a master copy. Pathetic to listen to.
5,Willie is so extraordinary!,"Willie Nelson never disappoints. As someone who has bought his recordings for the past 40 years, I still find him mesmerizing with his guitar pickin and his phrasing is legendary. Love Willie Nelson's ""Live From Austin Texas""."
2,Disappointed. Here's why:,"I like Willie Nelson. That's why I bought this. It seemed like a nice collection of his hits. After just a few songs, I realized he was basically talking the lyrics instead of singing them. It seemed so lazy. Has he lost his vocal range? Has his selection of recreational smoke affected his vocal chords? I wish I had just bought an earlier version of his hits album and not this tired recent live version. If I promise to delete the whole album, can I have my money back if I promise to buy another Willie Nelson album?"
3,little tikes vacuum,This seemed like a cute toy but the end piece the actual vacuum part did not stay on! I got it as a gift for a freind's daughter and I was a little embarassed that they had to use duct tape to hold it on. The price was great but...well I guess you get what you pay for!
3,UV resistant gloss,"I used this on the cloudy tail lights on my truck. I wet sanded first then applied the clear coat. Later I fine wet sanded then polished for a nice finish. They look great! Much better than before.My friend advised me to buy UV resistant clear coating so it doesn't fade.update: possibly due to my error but the tail lights have patches on them that don't look so good after 8 months. They look worse now than before I did anything to them.Also, I did the turn signals as well, those looked like complete crap after about 5 months. I had to buy new ones."
1,THIS IS GLOSS - NOT MATTE!!!!!,"Same thing as me. I JUST opened my package less than 3 minutes ago, and am not exactly happy. I figured by the picture displayed of the Krylon can that I was getting a MATTE. Wrong - I, like the other shopper, received GLOSS. I actually came back into Amazon and checked my order history to make sure that I didn't mis-choose some option.Luckily for me, I found a retail store earlier this week close by that actually HAS the Matte finish, which is what I need, and I no longer have to pay shipping on this product. I am sure that as time goes by, I'll figure out some way to use it, but for right now, I kinda feel like I got gypped. Be careful buying from this seller."
1,THIS IS GLOSS,"Do you see GLOSS in large type on this bottle ? When you receive it you will, IN LARGE BLACK LETTERS! Do you see this saying GLOSS FINISH anywhere ? Well it is , it's GLOSS! I typed in Matte UV resistant acrylic and this came up. It never said GLOSS anywhere so I assumed it was matte like most every fixative out there."
5,The best I've seen!,"I purchased this book in order to prepare for certification. Granted, a bit of industry experience does indeed help with any exam, we all know that exam providers love to nit-pick on the smallest details, and this book will get you there. It is exceptionally laid out, (I would recommend not paying attention to Dustin, as I don't think he gave this book a decent go at it).Trefil explains each concept clearly and concisely. I was not left with many questions that I was not able to figure out with a bit more digging, (usually within her book).Yes, there are a few mistakes and mismatches here and there, but I challenge anyone out there to find a tech-book, or certification guide for that matter, that is error free! They don't exist.All in all, I was very satisfied with the information this book supplies. I was able to successfully pass the certification and I have the author to thank!"
3,"Solid book, but not worth going out of way for...","I was hoping, based on the review given on this book, that I would learn a great deal more about some of the great Middleweights, such as Carlos Monzon, Marvin Hagler, 'Sugar' Ray Robinson, Harry Greb & Stanley Ketchel. Unfortunately, most of this book looks at a match by match retelling of all these greats, rather than try and flesh them out in greater detail.While Mr. Walsh does an admirable job from a historical review perspective, it really fails to go beyond that and examine the greats in better detail besides personal tragedies (Monzon's killing of his second wife, Kid McCoy's murder, conviction, then suicide post-release, etc.). I was pretty dissappointed, overall."
2,It was ok - shipping was more than the book,Insightful but it didn't go into much depth. It was a little hard to read but short enough to make it a quick read
4,"""Everyperson's Book About How To Cope With Grief""","As a psychiatric nurse, I have almost daily opportunities to counsel patients with all types of grief issues, and engage in an ongoing quest for new materials that assist me in reaching that goal. In reading ""Coping With Grief: A Self-Help Guide,"" by Mr. C.A. Komar, I found that he so simply, yet intelligently shares his own difficult journey through grief, in a manner easily understood by all who read it, with or without staff present, and regardless of cultural or intellectual backgrounds. This is a heartfelt work, and has become ubiquitous on my hospital's psychiatric unit, utilized by therapists and nurses alike, in leading coping skills groups dealing with issues of grief. Thank you, Mr. Komar, for sharing your insights, and your wisdom."
5,Good price for Epakitin 300 gm,"I purchased Epakitin from the vetenary clinic that treated our dog and the price was way higher than what I payed with Amazon. Our dog has kidney desease and needs to take this product along with Azodyl. Our poodle is doing great since she is on both of those medications. Sugar Land, TX"
4,Epakitin,"My dogs test results have improved since we've been using Epakitin. We also have her on Science Diet KD prescription food, so some of the credit probably belongs to that too."
5,Epakitin - Palatable to Pets,"My vet sent me home with this product to use with my dog who has renal (kidney) failure. I was surprised to find it was available over the counter. I can't vouch for its effectiveness, I am not a vet. But I can vouch for it being palatable to my dog, who has been on meds so long he is suspicious of everything that is not human food. I was shocked to find I could simply mix it into a couple of tablespoons of canned dog food (this is for a 20 lb dog so the dose is a small scoop) and he would eat it as if the dog food was straight out of the can. I'm very pleased with this product."
2,No emperical evidence it helps,"I purchased this device to boost the signal of my Garmin 885T. Unfortunately, I still lost satellite signal when I placed it at the top of my window, and even with this device placed on top of my car. So, I don't know if it is either broken or so weak it doesn't really boost the signal."
1,"Useless garbage, get gilsson instead !!","This antenna is garbage. I bought it over the gilsson because of the garmin name & because I didn't want to spend $99 for the other more expensive antenna that garmin sells.I will give it 0 stars of I could! Get the gilsson for abt 25 shipped. I finally trashed this & got gilsson instead. The gilsson maintains perfect satellite signal on my old streetpilot 2610, even under tree cover & tall buildings.Just my $.02..."
3,Easy to use not so easy to install,"Very good for the people who wants or need to be low profile with his GPS. Using this antenna makes possible for the customer to place the GPS anywhere below the wind shield line on the dash board.The little connector seems like will never detach again when connected for the first time, but with a firm way of pull on the right place will detach it and a couple of times going in and out everytime you need to put the GPS away will make it easier to detach.The cable would be longer in order to allow the installation on the rear end of the vehicle."
2,Garmin GPS Antenna,Minimal improvement. I don't think the product is worth the cost. I installed this to the inside of my windshield. It may work better if you can install to the outside of your vehicle.
3,Garmin GPS external Antenna,"I purchased the garmin external antenna as a means of keeping my gps safe and dry in my pocket, while still maintaining a strong signal during hikes and the like.When I first got the unit I connected it up and it worked fine. When I tried to disconnect the unit from the back of my GPS, it broke. Amazon is in the process of replacing the antenna, and I hope it was a defective model as opposed to a bad design.Amazon also gave me a purchase credit for the cost of shipping as I was shipping from Canada, and they pay free shipping in the US only. I was very pleased with the service. Let's hope that the new antenna's conenctor will work better than the old one.shannon Burt"
1,Cause reception to be worse,This item does not work very well. I have better reception when I use the internal antenna.
3,works best with an unobstructed view of sky,"Antenna works as advertised but still requires unobstructed view of sky, connection to palm is VERY hard to remove."
3,Alright,"For what they were, the boot covers worked. However, they come pretty large and I had to sew them around the ankles to create a more feminine look (they are pretty straight from calf to ankle and are somewhat unflattering). Even after sewing them to a more custom fit, the boot covers sagged all night and I was continuously pulling them up on my legs. Yet they fit so snuggly that they weren't easy to pull up either.Overall, I'd say they do in a pinch, but wouldn't recommend them if you have the time and money to find something better."
3,This book would've got an 9 but I only rated it a 6,"Hello, I am Johnathan Mark Smith from the Staten Island Java Group and I think this book would've been a 9 but I rated it a 6. This book is pack with great example and thing you would not find in alot of book. The only thing is that it is base on jdk 1.0.2 and not JDK 1.1"
4,Fits better in hand the predecessor.,"Personally, I really like the way the buttons have been rearranged to fit the hand. However, since there are fewer buttons, you need to use the ""shift"" key to get to important functions. I'm doing fine with it, but my husband is having troubles! The problem is you often have to do two functions in a row--one with shift and the other without. It gets a little confusing."
2,Foil cutter broke,"So far, I have had this long enough to open about a half dozen bottles of wine without incident. The foil cutter only works if you apply pressure. I applied enough pressure between my index finger and thumb to break it. The cutting wheel broke off the plastic spindle. The foil cutter is a good idea, but not functional for long as implemented."
1,Hidden design defect.,"The corkscrew worked really well for a very short time. But because the connection between the screw and the top section is so weak, it failed after about the 10th bottle (and it was not abused). Some samples should last longer, but the design is so weak that failure is probably inevitable. Too bad - it was nice while it lasted."
1,Lethal flaw,"As with previous reviewer, used this only 5-6 times before the spiral broke in the middle while screwing it into a cork (actually the soft plastic stopper now used by a major California winery)."
3,OXO Corkscrew,"We love OXO brand kitchen accessories. We probably used this corkscrew a total of six times, when it broke! The screw broke off, and it couldn't be fixed. Since it was over the 30 days since we purchased it from Amazon, we went directly to the OXO company for a replacement. After we sent the broken corkscrew to them, they replaced it with a new one within a couple of weeks. We can't complain, and we will continue to purchase the OXO brand products."
3,Great corkscrew but don't expect it to cut foil,The foil cutter feature is highlighted in the product description but does not appear on the actual product packaging. My guess is the product is not intended to cut foil...and...it doesn't. The corkscrew lives up to the expectations I have of OXO good grips. It is easy on the hand and works smoothly. Just don't discard your separate foil cutter.
2,5 stars no way.,"I am surprised that there are so many 5 star reviews for this movie.Like most of the negative reviewers I agree that there are sub plots that are never developed and that the storyline meanders all over the place.I hate to compare directors, but I think if Spielberg were to deal with this material it would be just as visually interesting but much more thought provoking and integrated.5 Stars is lowering the bar quite a bit.I guess there are Coppolla fans who geekily admire his technique, but it requires a coherent and involving script and story line too to make an exceptional movie."
3,Rating: So so...,"While I enjoy seeing Ms Lara in her movies, this particular one itself for me was too herky-jerky between the concepts in the theme and was difficult and tiring to follow due to that very reason."
4,Live forever,"A strange and almost hypnotic descent into human condition. To be the wisest and yet old and sick. To have met the most beautiful and to have been the love of your life and have lost in the pursuit of your career success. Mircea Eliade's genius in the hands of a master of cinema - Francis Coppola.To get old and have a chance to begin again, all, career, love, youth, health - the dream of every man and women.People who need to see this movie: people who are getting old, people who have sacrificed their life for their career, people who believe in reincarnation and the everlasting soul and those who don't, people who believe in the genuine and infinite potential of humanity.What I learned: if you want to live forever look into the future and never look back."
1,Do not buy,"When I placed the I ink cartridge in the printer it always produced an error message on my printer. It would never print, when I removed the black and put my used one in it finally recognized a new cartridge but of course it was empty so the test page only showed color and it wouldn't print any of my reports because it would always say low ink. Needed to buy a black one at target fit $19.99"
1,Horrible quality,"These cartilages are horrible... Things won't print properly and I can't use fast prints anymore because it'll just give me a white page. I would stick to normal cartilages.- After using it for awhile (the half of the ink is gone after less than a month, though) the ink stabilized and I can now print in fast mode. However, I just feel like authentic new ones are worth it's price for a reason. These seem to just run out a lot faster."
1,did not work,the company i bought it from wanted me to answer like 500 questions and make me do a bunch of work for them to fix it. Screw that. Huge waste of time. Go to Walmart and pay a few extra bucks!
1,cartridges,"Neither one of these cartridges worked. The black did not work at all, and the color had no red output. I will not use this company again."
3,Compatible HP 27 & 28,"Even though they were just bought, they print as if they were running out. Colors, including black print very light, like watered down. Haven't tried the second set yet."
3,HP 28 cartridge not recognized,"My printer, an HP PSC 1300 series does not recognize the 28 color cartridge. I ordered two of these and neither is recognized by the printer on my iMac. Am returning them. The 27 black cartridge works fine. UPDATE: After powering off the printer and restarting the printer, the 28 color cartridge was recognized. Different than the HP cartridge, which is instantly recognized."
1,Not worth the price,On the first day the color ink printed a little dull and the black ink was grey.... About 10 days later to now the color ink is extremely dull and the black ink is now a very light grey. We print about 3-5 pages per week...not sure if it is drying up but in my opinion I should still have vibrant color after 3 weeks. Stick with the manufacturers ink even though the price is a bit more.
3,"great service, ok compatibility","The ink cartridges I ordered came VERY quickly, and for that I would order again. However, when I print with the color cartridge everything is very dark and the quality is not the same as with regular HP cartridges I've bought. I would recommend the black cartridge for printing text, but if you want to print decent photos, I would not recommend the color from here."
2,Wish they worked better,I always look for a cheaper ways to buy ink since the price for new is over the top. I have found companies that offer ink that is reliable and those who are not so much. I got a two combo black and color. The black did not work at all and frankly looked like it was used up and not filled and the color was darker than the originals and came out off color. So my experience was not so good.
1,Only Came With Enough Ink To Print 3 Pages!,"This purchase was a rip-off. I ordered a black and color cartridge. The color cartridge was never able to register with my computer as being ""properly installed"", even though I knew it was correct and re-tried 4 times. For some reason the printer was still able to use the color cartridge. BUT, after printing only 3 full pages worth of font/images the ink no longer came out!!"
1,do not purchase,the color cartridge i received did not contain any red ink... everything that was supposed to be red printed in yellow.
1,HP 28,"Bought it, black worked, Color wouldn't register on my printer. What a waste. I won't be buying refurb ink again."
1,What a joke,"Don't waste your money. I ordered these ink cartridges because my current ones were almost completely out of ink.This ""compatible"" combo 2-pack had the same amount of ink, OR LESS, than my current cartridges.'Remanufactured' is one thing, but these are the equivalent of 'USED' .. You can re-man a product and sell it to me, but not if the product isn't COMPLETE. If I bought something that was remanufactured, let's say an Xbox. Yes, I would expect it to be used already, but still run well. I WOULDN'T expect it to be an incomplete product (like missing an AC cord, or not be able to connect to networks).Bottom line = just buy new ink cartridges that you KNOW are full."
1,"cartridges were not ""compatible""","Ordered 4/11/12 unfortunately didn't need to replace till 6/1/12. When it was time to replace message came up as ""cartridge does not match printer"". Went to website to find out how to get a refund. I only had till 5/22/12 to return for full refund so it is not worth it to return for partial refund because I will be paying more than the product itself. I will not order ink from Speedy Inks again."
5,Printer Cartridges HP 27 & 28,The product got here earlier then expected and have had no problems with print quality or quantity. I would buy this product again.
5,Armitron Womens Bracelet Watch,This Watch is beautiful. Bought it for my fiance and she has told me about the compliments she have received.
2,It's beautiful but difficult,I've had this watch for two months. It does look great. Learning to use the clasp and adjusting the band was a major ordeal. And last night I went to put it on and it stopped working. Hopefully it just needs a new battery but now I have to go through the trouble of sending it to one of their service centers. Ugh.
2,i dont get satisfy with it,"cant hardly see the numbers, give it away,not satisfy. numbers are the same color of the watch base,its in the garbage"
5,It's not sappy.,"I don't like sappy books, but since this was written by Angela Hunt, I thought I'd give it a whirl. I was not disappointed. Ms. Hunt can write about anything, and I'd read it. She's a wonderful story-teller, and her tales touch the heart without being overly sentimental. One of my favourite authors."
4,It changed my perception on christianity,"I have never read a book by angela hunt but I saw it on my mom's shelf and thought ""eh this should be a quick easy read that will amuse me at least a little"" boy was I wrongWhile it is a very easy read, and it is typical christian generic drama, I enjoyed the contrast of the main characters life and her son.It was that dichotomy of christianity that really got me thinking about my own 17 year walk with the Lord. It's not so much the THOU SHALT NOTS, but what are you really doing for God. Needless to say because of this book me and a few other friends now hold each other accountable to befriend the untouchables, hurt, and slums of life... and all because of this little novel."
4,Review of The Debt,I found this book inspiring for my own life! Would definitaly recommend this book to others! A story about breaking free of the bubble we sometimes live in and seeing things from a new perspective.
3,Christians need to be better,"I bought this book based on the reviews here at Amazon. I find it hard to believe I am the only reader rating this as 3 stars. Although I agree with the premise of the book, Christians need to go beyond the church and love non believers just as much as believers. The story was flat for me, and kind of sappy. I enjoy Angela Hunt's novels especially ""The Elevator"".I just thought this book needed more meat. This book needed a more in depth analysis of Emma's trouble past, and her relationship with her parents. Also more about her delivery of her son Chris and what she went through. I think less time should have been given to the church and its agenda. This is a great resource on how all Christians should live. I just didn't think the story was that compelling."
5,WOW ! Excellent read...,"There is simply nothing better than relaxing on your sofa, with a cup of tea (or whatever), and a novel by Karen Rose! Every one of her books that I have read (so far) have been 5 stars - even if the idea of falling in love (and bed, or couch, or stairs) within a week or two of meeting is a little far fetched, and with extremely handsome, sexy men (where are all these men anyway ???) Her books are still fantastic and grab the reader right from the start. I love how she will mention or write about a character, and then they make a repeat performance somewhere in another novel. It just makes her characters all the more ""real"" to the reader. I just wish I could eyeball some of these gorgeous men she writes about...then again, they probably don't exist in real life. That's why we have to read about them in fiction, I suppose. HAha"
3,Not her best,"This book was O.k. Rose's characters fall in love a little too fast for me. Not enough twists and turns, very predictable."
4,Good read!,This is the first book by Karen Rose I've read. I did find it dragging along at certain points but all in all I'd recommend this book to a friend. The author does have a way of making the characters real and you find yourself actually feeling their emotions right along with them and being drawn into the story. I found the closer I got to the end of the book the harder it was to put down. I'll be reading others by Rose.
1,Predictable and annoying characters,"First off, the writing itself isn't very good. I felt like I was reading a trash romance novel which is a genre I absolutely can't stand. Then there is the fact that every single character in the book is one-dimensional - the bad guy is predictably bad to the bones and the good guys could do no wrong (except of course for a few predictable 'conflicts' caused by emotional trauma not of their own doing). I was bored and annoyed and frankly very disappointed and surprised at the good reviews."
2,What a Drag,"OK so I have read my fair share of books in this genre and also my fair share of first novels by first time authors in this genre, and I have to say, after reading all the glowing reviews about this book and others by the author I was truly let down. This is genuinely the first time I have struggled to finish a book although Ive read some not so great ones in the past. I had to keep reminding myself that the two main characters were not in their 80s, just the way they spoke was so unrealistic. The actual suspense part picks up slightly in the middle but Rose totally failed to make me care one way or another about any of the characters and its that which makes an author great. However considering it was her first book and her books seemed to get such high ratings I do plan to give it another couple tries before making any final judgments."
3,Couldn't put it down!! Read til 3 am!!,"Although at first I thought this book would be a repeat of the Julia Roberts movie (Sleeping with the Enemy??), it was not and I found it to be a very compelling read and could not put it down. There is a good variety of characters and character development. The author doesn't rush the love story. It's suspenseful, full of romance, and also has many funny moments to keep it fun!"
5,Best first novel EVER!,"Although the premise and plot of this book has been done over and over, no one has done it better. The story of an abused wife and mother who finally takes action will not be new. However the tension, feelings, and fear of Mary Grace Winters is presented in a moment by moment way that keeps you on the edge of your chair, bed or floor. Wherever you choose to read. We are not kept in the dark about the feelings and motives of her husband or the man, (Max) who sees the kindness, generosity, and love that Caroline ( AKA Mary Grace ) has to offer. After seven years the worst happens and her policeman husband finds out she and her son are alive. With exquisite detail we follow him on his hunt. We follow Caroline as she finally becomes the woman she was meant to be. We see the dark edges of her soul and the ravages of horror meated out to her and her child. I could not put it down. You will not be disappointed. Spine-chilling suspense, unusual twists, and a great ending. Go for it."
5,Great GREAT book!**5 1/2 stars**,"Karen Rose has done it again! Very well written book with well developed and likable characters. A real page-turner. Karen Rose is a master at suspense. Lots of suspense books are based on the wife leaves husband due to abuse, but this book was unique and well worth your time and money. The characters are easy to relate to and I really hated for the story to end. I ran out and bought Have you seen her?, which is like part two of Don't Tell..both were excellent and a great addition to any suspense lovers collection."
1,Not worth the price and definitely not comfortable!!,"I bought a black and brown pair last year and although the shoes are very cute, I have been very unhappy with the purchase.The main problem is...they are not comfortable AT ALL, which I find strange since the company is known for COMFORT!!!I own several wedge shoes and think the problem is the heel sits too high. Most wedge shoes can have a higher heel (wedge) but the position of the foot is inside the wedge, not on top of the wedge. This creates a very unnatural slant and puts pressure on the ball of the foot.I will never buy another shoe from Aerosoles. I think they are overpriced and not comfortable. There is absolutely NO cushion at all in these shoes and the design is not well thought out.Buy at your own risk."
4,"Comfortable Wedge, Order a Size Larger","Needed to order a size larger, but I'm happy with the shoe. I'll probably put a cushion in the ball of the foot since the pitch puts more pressure there."
3,Didn't like it all,"I really think that they should have included much newer material, with new choreographies and young dancers of today. There are so many exciting and new dancers and choreographers at the Royal Ballet right now, which you expect to watch in this DVD. I enjoyed Les Patineurs and the Strauss Waltz, but the rest of it is dull, boring and even a little out of date already. Tamara Rojo is interesting as Isadora."
4,I Can See Again,"I have a 1986 Jaguar. While replacing the alternator on it I snapped the water hose nipple on the washer pump. So this Trico unit was bought to replace it.I was a bit concerned that this aftermarket pump would not snap into position on the side of the washer fluid resevoir. No worries there. Although the design is a little different, this pump fits perfectly. It was a quick job to pop out the old one and pop in the new one.My only complaint about the unit is the rubber grommet that comes with it. This grommet is supposed to replace the one that seals the pump intake to the washer bottle. However, it was not the correct size for mine; too small to seal the hole. Luckily, the 25 year old grommet in my bottle was still fairly pliable (I soaked it in Black Magic to give it some added softness).Except for the little grommet issue, this is a solid buy. Good price, fits perfect and best of all I can see out my windshield again."
5,The Best Jazz music you will ever hear.,"This cd is outstanding. This is how jazz should be, the singing is second to none and the music just relaxes your mind. I would recommend this cd to any one. If you listen to music this cd must be in your collection."
2,No Doris Day,"She sounds like Doris Day, but without the control. Here is your basic college freshman singer backed by lush and swinging ensembles that surpass her weak talent. Music lovers with trained ears will cringe a lot during the album. Forget this one."
5,Why didn't I have this book before?,As a writer and editor this book is a dream resource. Using the right word at the right time and place is one of the keys to successful writing. What a book - what a bargain!
5,"Imprint Training of the Newborn Foal: A Swift, Effective Method for Permanently Shaping a Horse's Lifetime Behavior",Super book. Loved it. Will use over & over again. Great ideas & thoughts in book.A must for any library.....
2,foal imprinting book,"I felt there was too much 'imprinting/handling' too early. I did not use many of the suggestions, but just handled the foals carefully just like I would with any newborn. Both my foals are very personable and I don't know if that's because of their dams' temperament from the way I train them, the way I work with the foals and their mothers or because of how carefully I chose their dams AND sires. I certainly have not OVER-handled them."
3,Excellant method - if you have help!,I bought this book before the birth of my first foal. I thought I had a very good understanding of everything contained in the book. But be forewarned. This is not a something that someone can do alone. You need at least one other experienced horse person to help you. This is an absolute necessity!
1,"If you like being abused, this game is for you.","This game used to be one of the best MMORPG, you could customize your character, and at least feel unique among thousands of other people in the Star Wars universe. Now you're forced to select cookie cutter characters, including a nerfed Jedi class which gets killed fast in PvP, and even in PvE against NPCs which are 30 lvls below you. SOE/LucasArts decided that they don't care about what veterans think and introduced the NGE (New Gaming Experience). The sad thing is that SOE/LucasArts will probably even change this game around 6 months from now, so whatever hundreds of hours you play to build your character will be destroyed.Save your money and play World of Warcraft, City of Villains, Guild Wars, or any MMORPG that isn't run by SOE."
1,Could I be THAT stupid?,"Ugh, this game is nothing compared to battlefront, or knights of the old republic, oreven Battle for naboo, a N64 title. I was trying to keep on buying these games, but this dissapoints me. BUY SOMETHING ELSE"
1,Craptacular,"Worst piece of garbage ever to be pushed to a live server. Do yourself a favor and move on. Game is boring buggy, and laggy."
1,Complete ripoff,"First pay for the game then get charged $15 a month just to play it. Get busy, can't play for a while $15 a month. Get bored want to play something else for a while $15 a month. Want to cancel, good luck getting a hold of anyone. Decide you want to play again later, start all over from scratch you canceled your account. Hours and hours of game time you paid for gone!"
1,cheap!!!!,Star wars Galaxies is cheap! This game is a online game and you go online and you PAY TO PLAY!!! It stinks I will never play the game agen.
1,Just mention it,I bought this game and on nowhere on the cover or the box does it say about the monthly subscription for $15 a month. Don't buy this game unless your willing to pay the subscription.
1,Pathetic - Do not waste your money on this!,"Star Wars Galaxies used to be a great game...There have been 2 major changes since the initital release in 2003 and this recent change made has utterly RUINED the game. This is a starter for the online version, a way to get you to buy the online product by giving you a taster of the first levels. As a game, the graphics are very buggy, and the constant clicking of the mouse will leave your hand in pain (No joke!). The game has been taken over by Lucasarts who have no history in making mmorpg's, which is what this Starter Kit is the first few levels of...Save yourself the money and do not buy this game!"
1,No longer a good game,"This was once a great game, one of the best, but Star Wars Galaxies have unfortunatly lost a lot the last 2 years. Where other games evolve and get new levels of complexity SWG has become simpler and simpler and lost much of its old charm. Changes upon changes have been made not by the wishes of the players and the community but by the Developers who no longer seem to understand the customerbase at all.This game no longer has a vision.This game no longer is fun.This is NOT the game you are looking for."
5,Give it a true test!,"StarWars Galaxies has been a long standing favorite of mine. Yes it has gone through alot of rough changes but it is far from ruined. The game now is evolving. The system is now a bit easier but far more fun. The combat is fast-paced and a bit less confusing. Players are urged to go tackle the many dungeons with their groups/guilds and take part in the Galactic Civil War. SWG does not suck now, nor is it ruined. SWG is just different and if given the test, I am sure you all will enjoy it."
1,Avoid like the plague,"The game just went through a massive dumbing-down that has thousands of veteran players engaging hyperdrive and leaving the Galaxy(ies) .... never a very well-managed MMO, it's taken a big step back from the potential it once had, settling on being a very linear FPS, but not a very good one."
1,Dont waste your money this is not a real MMORPG anymore,Dont waste your money this is not a real MMORPG anymore!
1,Crap,"This game was the best game ever when it first started, I wasn't bugged all that much with the first CU, besides when they did it, more bugs popped up.I played for a while, finally got Jedi. And then 2 months later they make the profession of Jedi suck, give me a stupid cloak and a holocron that is bugged and say ""oh jedi is a normal profession now.""SoE sucks, this game sucks, and the people who are still playing it are complete idiots.Do not buy this game, it really sucks."
1,This was the best game... UNTIL Nov. 15th,"I played this game for 2 years and 3 months, which is basically a couple months after it launched. This game was so unique and diversive. I never remember a dull moment in the early times. They revamped the game in late April/early May and although it retained a lot of it's charm, some of the things I loved about the game were gone. But NOW, they have completely wiped this game of everything that made it unique. It's no longer fun. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, not only because it is no longer worth the $15 a month, but also because SOE does not care about their customers.Do not waste your money. If you want fun, this is not the game you're looking for. Adventure? Excitement? This game contains not these things."
1,Buggy SWG 1.5,"The game has been tottaly revamped, for new people you can only level up to lvl30 atm and then your stuck, until they add more content + fix alot of the abilities for classes & crafters. I spent 2 years getting jedi and now its pretty much worthless, people now get it in 30 seconds :(."
1,A decent game.. if you're 12,"The game Starwars Galaxies, commonly referred to as SWG, is a total waste of money in my honest opinion. The game has many many bugs, which are failed to be looked at the by the ingame developers. Once a great game, SWG was played by millions bring in tons of top dollar for SoE. The lack of Customer service and being treated like dirt has caused many players of SWG to quit. With the current release of the NGE, which is the second time they've totally revamped the game(keeping in mind it is an online game STILL in beta), they've lowered the skill level to become adequate with that of Teenagers and younger.In conclusion, if you like being treated crappy, want new content every 6 months, and are under the age of 13, Starwars Galaxies is for you."
1,Appauling,"A game where you can play Jedi, but a Jedi Master is not like in the movie but the weakest class in game. You are dead before you reach your ranged opponent.A game so full of bugs that you will hate it. Doing a quest to kill an enemy at a location? After 5 minutes of traveling you will reach the location only to find the enemy isnt there: it hasnt been programmed yet.Do yourself a favor and play something else."
3,Revised Review,"After playing the game under much sufferance over the past few weeks I have grown accustom to the changes and suffice it to say, I like it - in fact i prefer the game to the pre-publish 25 issue.The only downside is that you are forced to seek out groups rather than go it alone otherwise you die all the time.The combination of being able to craft and fight is sorely missed in the NGE but maybe Sony will revise this notion for P26?No more major changes those Sony, for heaven's sake!!!"
1,A prime example of how not to manage an online game,"I've been playing this game since June 2003 - since before the game hit the market (I was one of the beta testers.)After over two and a half years, I'm leaving the game. Star Wars Galaxies has been through a series of massive game changes, and the latest set of changes has made the game both unstable and unplayable.These changes were pushed out as a ""last ditch"" effort to attract new players, at the expense of veteran players. With so many bugs, however, both new and veteran players are clamoring to get surcease - and SOE's response is indifference in-game and a media blitz to overcome the bad press.In short, don't waste your time or money. Find a game with a stable user interface and enough content to keep you going throughout the game's lifecycle - City of Villains, Dark and Light, and World of Warcraft come recommended by many former Star Wars Galaxies players."
1,Very Boring Game,played this game for a week and already very bored.this game has no content. the quests are bugged.the combat reminds me of a 1980's atari game.there is nothing to do but grind and level up in the is game.95% of the population are jedi and all have the same skills.it's like fighting yourself. save your money.this game is for 3yr olds.
1,Stay Away From This Game,I played this game for over a year. In that time they had TWO major changes to the game. In both changes all your armor weapons and other equipment changed stats and things that were very valuable became worthless. It is very disheartening to spend 100's of hours building up yuor character only to have all that effort trashed. Now they have changed the combat to a First Person Shooter style and with all the lag on the servers it has become unplayable. All the patches they release are full of bugs and their Customer Support is terrible. I could go on forever but in short save your money and buy something else. PacMan would be more enjoyable than this garbage.
1,"If you love MMORPG and Star Wars, Stay far far away...","While Lucas Arts trying to sell this game to earlier ages, it has actually lost MMORPG aspect and complete turned into texture shooters that we are not seeing since first 3D games. Depth and complexity left its place to common characters. A complete genre change in an MMORPG was unacceptable and happened.On Star Wars side, it was also unacceptable to see tens of Jedi in starports in the Empire's most powerful times.As final words, if you love Star Wars and enjoy playing MMORPG's, stick with them and stay far far away from this product."
1,Was once good now pitiful,This game is now horrible. There customer service is useless there ppl care nothign for the players. They lie and cheet there player base it is not worth the 15 dollars a month. DO NOT BUY THIS GaME IT iS THE WORST THING EVER. O and lots of flamming on the forums with a mini war gogin on between current players and the development.
2,NGE is terrible,"This game is dying, do not help it live any longer than it has to. Try the game called ""Dark and Light"" instead. LucasArts screwed the players, and Sony screwed the players. They changed a game completely AFTER it had been going for 2 years. No legacy servers either.The game is very buggy, it is terribly unbalanced. After level 30, you will have nothing to do unless you give SOE *more* money for expansions."
1,"Was good, now sucks","The previous reviewers hit the nail right on the head. What started as a great game with unlimited potential has been ""fixed"" by SOE into a grotesque ten-year-olds comic book of a game. It is really sad and quite disgusting for any fan of Star Wars. This game does not deserve Star Wars. It is a mockery."
1,do not buy this game,"Sony Online Entertainment took an Empire Divided and destroyed it slowly. They had 2 major ""upgrades"" The first was not good and the last one called the NGE completly changed the game so much so that they release these new ""starter kits"". The servers are empty and anyone who has played will tell you the same thing. to keep away."
1,Do NOT buy this game,"This game used to be fun, but it was recently ""updated"" and the game was destroyed by something they refer to as a new game enhancement. Basically they've eliminated all of the fun components of the game and left a shell of its former might. If they ever rollback to a pre-updated state of the game and restore everything before the update then it's a good game, but after the update it's really just a waste of time. Go play something else, read a book, watch a movie, etc."
1,Just not fun anymore....,"Don't get me wrong, I was a huge SWG fan, but since the NGE its really really not worth your time. I'm sure there is a free trial to download somewhere so check that out, but take my advice and ""Move along"""
1,"Huge Ripoff, HORRIBLE game.","I have been playing this game for about 2 years. But now, it's totally changed and is a total ripoff.Don't buy it. Don't even think about it. Save that $15 or go buy WoW. This game is dead. They screwed their player base. Lied to them about where the game was headed and then basically told all of us to shove it when we said we were unhappy.If you looked at the forums for this game, you would see how bad it is.In a couple months, they'll close the doors on this game anyway. No reason to waste your money"
1,Complete Garbage,"This game has been active for over 2 years. The game since launch still has over thousands of bugs. They recently did 2 huge game re-vamps. The first one was the start of the fall of the game. Massive amounts of players left the game during the first revamp and now this second revamp that just occured caused everyone in the game to leave. This is a MMO and there is no one to play with online since everyone quit. The game is unplayable due to bugs, no content, the professions are broke and unbalanced. It's a waste of money buying this game. I rather play ToonLand Online. That game is more fun."
1,bugs bugs and more bugs - and lousy customer service,"This is the THIRD version of the game to come out in the same number of years. SOE does not listen to their player base even though they claim to. The player base told the developers what was wrong and how to fix it, did SOE listen? Not a chance. For the record I have played this game since launch, went through the highly touted Combat Upgrade and now the NGE. Each version shows more bugs than the last with an ever increasing 'decrease' in game value. Once SOE decides what this game is supposed to be (is it a RPG or a FPS, you can't have both) it may turn around. Until that time stay away."
1,Hugely Disapointed,"I have played this game since day 2, ""The first day was bugged""and I have played it till recently, the original game was awesome I couldnt get enough of it and then they come out with the NGE-New Game Experiance and it has become a fiasco. All my friends that I have meet online have disapeared, My character is not playable,(by the way I was a jedi, so if you want to be Jedi be aware)and the keymap makes absolultly no sence.In my oppinion do not buy this game unless they make a lot of fixes to it."
1,A shell of its former self,"This is a review from a veteran player that was in favor of the NGE or at least the concept. My feelings changed, however, once I played it in ""live"". If it were a year ago this review would be raving. However, in light of the recent events in the world of this game, I would seriously warn any prospective buyer from purchasing this in its current state. STAY AWAY. SOE, the developers of this game, have turned this game into a frustrating experience that has absolutely no FUN factor. Players spend more time trying to find their way around bugs than actually playing. Every single system in the game is broken. Combat, crafting, questing, professions nothing works. If you are looking for an expensive headache (gotta buy the game plus a $15/month subscription) then this is the game for you. If you are looking for fun then find something else. Trust me, I've been playing it since 2003 but no more."
1,A good game ruined by a greed!,"Not much to say really apart from I've been playing this game for over two years and now it has been ruined by poor management decisions by a company that doesnt care for it's existing customers.The NGE (New game enhancements) was sprung upon the loyal subscribers with two weeks notice. To cut a long story short, all that anyone had ever worked for with their characters was made worthless.Bugs, laggy servers, poor customer support, and a development team that doesnt listen to its players are the hallmarks of this game.A great game ruined.Avoid!"
1,Recommendation from a 2+ year vet,"I loved this game, and was online almost every day for 2+ years... then they announced the NGE. They have introduced a simplified version (AKA Star wars galaxies for dumies). The profession choices have been reduced from 32, down to like 12, that is including crafting. The new combat system is point and click, and is lagged majority of the time even with high speed = not fun. I tried the new system out as a commando, but 90% of the commando weapons are bugged. This game is bugged, please do not waste your life/time on this game like I did for two years.Many other issues and problems... but read the swg forums for those details. Wish I could get my time I wasted on this game back. Please dont fall into the trap, just because the game has Star Wars written on it... Darth Vader looks like an angel compared to the customer service they have."
1,Failure IS an option.,"To be blunt:The original game shipped in a late-beta format, and those of us who bought it early betatested on a paying basis for months. As they approached a quality goal, they revamped the system, relegating the playing community to Beta again.You're buying the revamp AFTER the revamp, which represents an utter annihilation of the previous systems. This is an admitted attempt by Sony to get players from other games... by stealing the format of other games. The existing playerbase effectively suffered a character deletion, just in time for the Christmas buying season.You have been warned."
2,It would be good but,"Ok I loved this game at one time. I played before the combat upgrade. And Well just got back into it again. and Well as I got back in and right before I hit my highest level SOE did it again they changed it! Yeah the Jedi and bounty hunters can do new things and than guess what they changed it again. I think if SOE tried to stop being like WOW and Everquest they might have something good here. But until they stop changing game play and stop forcing people to do things they don't want to do, they are just going to keep messing up a great game. But hey even Lucas changes his movies all the time so the fan boys should be used to changes they don't like right?"
1,SWG sucks now!!!,"Used to be a great, fun online game. The first MMO I ever played. Tough to get started off in, but the complexity kept me playing for over a year and a half. Now SOE has made terrible changes to the combat system, and dumbed everything down, reducing the original 30+ professions to just 9. They also made Jedi a starting profession, which some people spent countless hours to get previously. The Jedi mystique is gone, the fun is gone, and I am gone from the game. Don't start this one - you'll just get frustrated and quit."
1,A tragic end to a once mediocre game,SWG was never great but it had it's own thing going. I'd go back from time to time and play because I knew I could scrap my template and the game would be fresh again. This is no more.SWG is now nothing more than a poorly implemented and buggy console game.
1,Absolutely horrible,"Bug filled and broken. Possible developed by Chimpanzees through outsourcing. This game is a pale shadow of what it used to be. Sony Entertainment and Lucas Arts routinely lies to its customer base and recently cheated through a bait and switch tactics about 2 days before this broken ""new game enhancement"" was announce they released ""Trials of ObiWan"" expansion on promises and content that was immediately rendered obsolete. Customer service is rude if when it isn't non-existant. Save your money for another MMORPG, this one is horrible, simply horrible. I will never buy another SOE or Lucas Arts computer game again."
