1,what does it do??,"Been taking this for a month or more now. Haven't noticed the slightest benefits. Pricey for what you get, & comes in a nice large container, less than half full of powder [is there REALLY that much settling?], so we'll be sure and have adequate amounts of plastics in our landfills. Wouldn't want to skimp on that part."
4,Good followup to the previous three in the series,"Excellent story . Only criticism is the lack of continuity in some of the names of the characters. E.g Mantu the youngest son of Jubadi (the Merki Horde Qar Qarth - Books 2and 3) becomes Mupa. Jim Hinsen , the renegade 35th Maine soldier, becomes Dale Hinsen.Olivia , Chuck Fergusons bride, becomes Valencia later in Book 5 as well. Small things that mar the continuity of an excellent read."
5,Still the finest recordings of Mozart's greatest symphonies,"After hearing fine interpretations from the likes of Bernstein, Karajan, and Kubelik, Bohm's readings of Mozart's last symphonies remain imposing, worthy of recognition as the best in a crowded field of recordings. No late 20th Century conductor has been as successful as Bohm in conveying the drama as well as lyricism present in Mozart's greatest symphonies. I doubt I have heard the Berlin Philharmonic play these symphonies with such elegance, warmth and technical precision. These recordings are among the highlights in a complete Mozart symphony cycle which Bohm and the Berlin Philharmonic recorded during the 1960's. If I'm not mistaken, this was the first Mozart symphony cycle recorded in stereo. The sound quality is impressive with the latest image bit digital remastering."
3,"Efficient interpretations and lovely playing, but there's more to Mozart","I can see someone admiring these recordings, since they are very well executed and crisply presented, with no major flaws. And I can see why Mozart was considered one of Karl Bohm's best composers if you like his foursquare, unsmiling approach. Apparently many other listeners and reviewers don't demand more than what this bargain set of the last six symphonies delivers.But Bohm's traditional Teutonic conducting sounds pretty limited to me, not because of the ""authentic"" movement now in vogue but because great Mozart conducting must be joyous, light on its feet, and full of wit and alertness. Bohm is brisk and efficient instead. Bruno Walter was born even earlier than Bohm, and yet he got all those things right. That's why I return to him again and again, not to this set, much as I love the Berlin Phil."
4,Nice.,"It is a nice recordings. But if this is the right Mozart style... I am not sure. Anyway, nice to hear it!"
3,Going against the tide,"While these symphonies are impeccably done, the tempo is much too slow and deliberate for me."
2,MOZART #s 35-41,"This CD arrived in a timely manner, but for some unknown reason the audio plays extremely low on my equipment. I have to turn the volume up to a ridiculous level to get audible sound. ?? This is unfortunate because these symphonies are some of my favorites."
5,Exquisite.,"I once heard someone joke that Boehm probably conducted Mozart better than Mozart conducted Mozart.This gorgeous CD will make that assertion seem plausible. Boehm's tempo is bullseye perfect; the performance being (in my opinion) the most graceful one available to date. The Berlin Philharmonic gives a first-rate performance here: these are powerful, precise renditions of the late symphonies without a single overblown note.This is really Boehm at his best. You may find recordings that are equally good, but you will find none that are better."
1,Worst Mozart Recording,"I have to confess that I did not buy this product from Amazon or from any retailer for that matter.As part of my research I listened to the entire CD from the library.I am not sure why people give this CD high ratings. This is the WORST PERFORMANCE of Mozart's symphonies that I have heard.I have been listening to Mozart for close to a decade and along with Beethoven is my favorite composer.My criticism of this CD is mainly that this is not the way Mozart's music is to be played. Mozart's music is supposed to be full of energy, dynamism and melody.I would direct you to either Mackerras or Neville Marriner."
2,Microscope,This is definitely a toy. If you or your child are really interested in learning how to use a microscope and how to make slides. You may want to spend a little more money and get a quality microscope.
2,Very nice but too complicated,I bought this for my niece but never ended up using it. I feel like you need an advanced degree in science to figure this out..
3,"Reworked Capercaillie songs, original versions were better","CAPERCAILLIE, a self-titled disc, is a set of remixed and reworked songs, mostly from SECRET PEOPLE (which is, for some strange reason, getting hard to find).Most of the songs give an even greater showcase of Capercaillie's singer Karen Matheson but, to tell the truth, the original versions are better. Giving songs like ""Alisdair Mhic Cholla Ghasda"" an afro-sounding beat might make them hip and modern, but the remixing takes away from the traditional nature of Capercaillie's repetoire.Because a lot of the tracks of SECRET PEOPLE were already pretty contempory-sounding, a few songs like ""Bonaparte"" and ""The Miracle of Being"" aren't very different from the originals. But nonetheless, I would encourage anyone to pick up SECRET PEOPLE (or any other Capercaillie album) before listening to this interesting, though uninspired, diversion."
2,"Been done better on ""Secret People""","I was disappointed in this album. Most of the songs were remakes from the ""Secret People"" CD (I already knew this) and I guess I just expected better. There is liberal use of musical programming on each song and (in my opinion) it gets monotonous pretty quickly. I'm a big fan of Capercaillie but this one just didn't cut it for me. The versions on ""Secret People"" are better."
1,False Advertising,"The picture clearly showed a Licensed SNES power adapter. However what I received was a Retro AC Universal Adapter, that works with The NES, SNES, and Genesis. Not only was the cord length too short, but it was far too sensitive to shorting out.(A light tap on the cord and the system reset) Also, the cheap flimsy thing made my games look terrible. There was lines running through the screen. I know It's not my console, because it was in perfect working order last week, and has been for many many years. I take very good care of my SNES, and I would never taint it by plugging this awful unlicensed adapter back into it. How disappointing...."
1,Really upset!,"This thing is absolute garbage, they show an actual licensed SNES adapter, and what shows up is the cheapest piece of crap I have ever seen. I went to plug it in, and one of the metal prongs simply fell out into the outlet. To make matters worst it wasn't even shipped on time. Making this my second purchase from amazon, and my second product that didn't work upon opening."
1,Just like everyone said,"Bought this and tried it out from the seller and it's a generic cord that has 2 different sized ends. the pack says 10v but plugged into the super nintendo i got the same thick black lines running down the screen and the screen would split while playing(bottom of the picture jumping to the top). NOT convenient when trying to dodge fireballs on Super Mario. $10 wasted, i would recommend looking on craigslist/pawnshops first."
1,Garbage,This is a double tipped adapter. Is is not an official Nintendo cable. This causes a Rainbow Gradient and could further damage ones system.
1,Fried my SNES,"Be very careful what power converter you get for your SNES. The one they sent me was a knock-off unit that put out 14.5 volts and 2 amps way more than should have been going into my SNES and way above what the label said (10V, 850mA). I'm very disappointed. I had to buy another power converter (in person) and fix the fried electronics in my SNES."
3,okay,"its okay, not a nintendo brand but does the job, works well with snes nes and sega. picture is NOT the product its a scam."
1,WRONG AC ADAPTER!!!,Its says on the box its dor SNES but it is not ... not even near ... and nothing like the picture
5,works great,my origional cord just stopped working this one works great and is so much lighter than the origional the price was also not bad
5,Great Replacement,I lost my other cords for my Super NES during the move so I had to buy another set of cords. This adapter works well and is exactly what I need for my Super NES. It also isn't one of those adapters that is constantly unplugging itself if you barely move the gaming system.
2,LOOK AWAY BEFORE YOU ARE SCARRED!,"This adapter was garbage. For the first few months, fine. After that, the prongs broke, chords wouldn't work and the case came open. Dangerous and crappy, what more could you ask for?"
2,"Good Schuman, Bad Brahms","To add yet another voice to this chorus of critics, I must say that I think Karajan does the best job possible in selling the Spring Symphony as a great work (which it really isn't). This may sound like a back-handed compliment, but it really isn't; it takes true talent to turn mediocrity into greatness. And the irony is, all the things I usually hate about Karajan's ""sound"", the thick and luxurious string tone, the warmed-over woodwinds, the blaring brass, are all right at home in this symphony. So Hurvitz is wrong on this one. He has a point with the Brahms, though. Karajan never understood the burnished, noble qualities of Brahms, and here he simply skates over some of his most glorious orchestral writing. So, an unusual situation: recommended for the filler, not for the main feature. If you want this orchestra doing Brahms 1st, try Abbado's digital recording. If you want an older, cheaper, classic recording, go for Bruno Walter's."
4,It is a good C++ book but...,"You have to know that its target audience is beginner C++ programmers. I am somehow experienced with C++ programming and by looking at the excellent reviews this book got, I had high expectations when I purchased it. I have been disappointed to only have found maybe 2 small advices that I did not know. Reading over 250 pages for a so small reward has been disappointing. If you consider yourself good in C++, my advice is that you should skip this one."
1,Horrible,"Extremely uncomfortable, never used them. This was the first and last time that I ever bought sneakers online. I learned my lesson - sometimes the old-fashioned way works!"
5,Absolute reference in Liszt's Masterwork,"Liszt's masterpiece ""Eine Faust Symphony"" is a lavish orchestral depiction of three characters from Goethe's Faust.Using nothing but sound, Liszt paints detailed pictures of the three characters' emotions, psychology, and personalities.The symphony has beautiful melodies and clever musical storytelling techniques to illustrate the characters and is anexcellent showcase of Liszt's astounding talent.The absolute reference in this work is by Leonard Bernstein conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It's a luxuryperformance, with a wise approach from conductor and a wonderful, brilliant and sophisticated playing by the Boston orchestra.It's a bit on the slow side, but because of this you can hear the details and combinations of all deparments of the orchestrabetter, specially the glorious brass section! It is with no doubt the greatest recorded performance of this work. A must."
1,Devil Diamond,"This movie was such a waste of time. It was all over the place, it was a very confusing movie. I don't knowDevil Diamondseem like it could've been worth something because it had a good story line but it just didn't show in the movie. This is the kind of movie that starts in the middle and goes nowhere."
5,April 16-ounce Coolers-Beautiful and Elegant,"I was very excited to receive these iced beverage glasses,as well as the April pattern dinnerware. I absolutely love them, and am proud to show them off. I have written reviews on both-very in-depth reviews, noting everything about the glasses.I am a Top Reviewer/advisor for the epinions consumer review site in the areas of Home and Garden, Pets, Restaurants, and online sites/services. Please feel free to come visit my review on the glasses and see my profile and photo. If you would like email me with questions/comments also. Thanks.Suzi ..."
5,a definite keeper,"This book has depth and subtlty of feeling that is not often found. It has an interesting, unusual heroine in Anne, and a sense of real emotional connection between her and Jack. You read this book and you care for the characters, you want them to get together and when it ends you hope you will meet them again some day.It is something about redemption and what is real love and what makes us want to live or die... more depth than average and certainly not a light confection, but worth spending time with. A definite keeper. I think it's Connie Brockway's personal best."
4,A jewel thief and a spy-- let the fun begin.,"This one is definitely an enjoyable read. I found both the hero and the heroine interesting as opposed to most novels where either one or the other is interesting but rarely both. There is enough humor to satisfy a Brockway fan, but this time there is more sadness beneath the surface. Nicely developed characters and a well deserved happy ending. Definitely worth the effort."
2,"I liked ""As You Desire"" MUCH more!","I highly recommend ""As You Desire"" over this one. All Through the Night is VERY angsty and some of the heroines inner revelations come a little too much too late for my taste instead of seeing her change throughout the story. *shrug* that's just my 2 cents though."
3,Great storyline but...,"I thought this storyline was a 5+, the physical encounters were a sizzling 10, and I really liked the characters. However, much of the writing was just so stiff that I found it rather distracting. I mean, how many people ""think thus""? I certainly appreciate historical accuracy and I understand that part of Jack's charm is his gentlemanly behavior juxtaposed against the dichotomy of his rough background. Nevertheless, something just didn't flow. It was still a nice story. I just see where it could have been so much more with a more fluid, poetic writing style."
2,A bit too proper for me,"The book, though well written, did not inspire great loyalty for any of the characters. What could have been a terrific alpha male turned out to be a tall, muscular stuffed shirt. Every word and action reeked of manners. I knew that the book was a disappointment when even the thefts seemed proper."
5,Most Underrated Writer in Romance,"This is a wonderful book. So many romances are poorly written, poorly plotted, and poorly imagined. (I have thrown more than few against the wall mid way through the first couple of chapters.) If you want an intelligent, romantic read this is the book for you. I have enjoyed all Ms. Brockway's work, but this book, ""My Dearest Enemy,"" ""Anything for Love,"" and ""As You Desire"" rank amongst the best of romantic fiction. I know from Ms. Brockway's web site that she reads these reviews, so I have one question: ""When will you write Gile's story?"""
2,OK but I wouldn't recommend it.,What I liked: The plot was good. The characters were great. I liked Jack's lust and love for Anne from the beginning. I liked Anne's intelligence and thieving skills and her ability to figure out who had the missing letter. I liked some of the plot twists. I liked the scene describing how Jamison first met and took Jack as his son from a workhouse.What I did not like: The ending was unfinished. I wanted to know where they would go and how they would live. I wanted to know what would happen to the money and property Anne inherited from her previous husband. I didn't understand what Anne was trying to do when she visited Jack at night in his room and tied him up. The writing style was too drawn out with some conversations either boring or too long.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: four. Setting: 1817 London. Copyright: 1997. Genre: regency romance.
3,Owned for few months,"I've had this lens for a few months. Does everything its built for. Its not slow or fast to focus. It does deliver sharp photos. The macro function is a nice bonus. I haven't studied the photos I've taken with this lens for any aberration, but no photos taken with this lens have turned out bad. Well the bad photos weren't the lens's fault...Would buy again unless I win the lottery."
4,Early Seven Nations,"This rare CD is very EARLY Seven Nations. Not everything is written by Kirk and it has more traditional Irish music than what is included in their recent CD's. Some tunes I really liked; some were just OK to me. Loved the title song. It's a nice part to a Seven Nations collection as you can hear how they have progressed from this CD to their recent ""Time as the Enemy"". Buy it - enjoy!"
5,dvd Last summer in the Hamptons,"product as described, no problem with running the dvd, promptly shipped. Would order again from this seller.I am satisfied"
3,Love the setting . .,"I just love the East Hampton setting of this movie and the gray shingled house. I thought a lot of the movie was 'tongue in cheek' with a bit of 'mockumentray' thrown in. There are some great serious scenes and I agree with another poster here that Viveca Lindfors was wonderful (as she always is). So I'm not sure what this film is ""suppose"" to be - but I do find it enjoyable."
2,A disappointment!,"Apart from Viveca Lindfors' acting which was the highlight of the movie, it was very much dialogue driven, not action oriented and visual. The plot is thin, the pace is slow, and there aren't many surprises. A compelling hook is missing which makes the movie a bit of a bore."
5,A very excellent book,"I finished reading this book on Dec. 25, 1977, and my post reading note said: ""The book, in inimitable Dangerfield style covers the period from 1800 to 1906 sketchily and the period from 1906 to December 1921 carefully. Dec. 6, 1921, is the date the Irish delegates signed the Treaty--the Irish Civil War came in July 1922 and is beyond the scope of this book. This was an excellent treatment, very fair to the Irish and all in all just an excellent treatment: really the best I've read."""
1,Mysogyny = History?,"While the book makes highly entertaining reading, it is dangerous in its glibness. Dangerfield&#65533;s account is often referred to as a fundamental source for the women&#65533;s suffrage movement in Britain, but his manipulation and outright suppression of facts willfully twists the contributions of the Pankhursts, radical feminists whose thinking was far in advance of its time. One often has difficulty identifying which he hated most: the incompetence of the Liberal Party or the women fighting for political recognition."
5,review cards,"While I haven't taken the boards, yet. I have had a chance to look through the cards and they are very organized and thorough. I have heard from other reliable sources that they are all you need to know for the boards."
4,Great for Studying,"I used these cards for studying for my MLT, ASCP boards and loved the easy outline form and basic important info for each subject. I would give it 5 stars if it came with it's own binder or at least punch holes. I bought a large coupon book holder for it and separated the departments/chapters. These are pretty large review cards and do not fit into a large 6""x4"" index card holder."
5,MLT student,"I bought the Kindle version and I must say, I am impressed. My class was the first in my state to do all our course work digitally (iPad), and I have found that having these cards have really helped in class. While there could be better features on the Kindle iPad app alone, the Quick review cards themselves are Great. Best part: No lost cards; Quick and easy to find information; Bookmarks and notes make finding things easy; With my smart phone app, I have access to the cards wherever I go. Too bad Kindle doesn't have an app designed for college students that offers more functions. That would be great!"
4,Great review,"These cards are really going to come in handy to study for the board exam. It's a very large stack, organized and numbered according to subject matter. So, if you want to concentrate more on one particular subject like hematology or microbiology, you can study just that group of cards. It's one more tool you can use that will help you pass the boards. I also recommend them just for studying for tests in class. It contains the basic information and I wish I had gotten them at the start of training to help me study for tests. I recommend them."
5,great study aid,THese are very well put together and very informative. The only thing I dont like is that they are a strange size and its hard to find a box to put them in.
3,loose cards without case,"The contents are really great but since it is a flash card, I was expecting it has some sort of a box to set it in when it's not in use, that's the only draw back about this item. Everything else is great."
4,Great study aid,"These cards are great. I am a MT student and have used these for a supplement to my books and notes. The cards are easy to use and have a lot of info, the only down side is the size they are pretty big. When I first got them I carried all of them around but now I choose a section to review for awhile. The other down side is b/c they are so big it is hard to find a box or folder for them. I ended up with a expandable folder from office depot.Overall a great buy."
5,"The best of Berg, ravishing Stravinsky","If you're one of those who, like me, find Berg a little bit too luscious, too late-19th-century-ish, this work will probably surprise and delight you. It is known as his most Schoenbergian work, which may be the reason why it is less known than for example the violin concerto, and which also accounts for the unusually lucid textures and relatively detached treatment of the wonderfully inspired musical material. The coolness of this masterpiece renders Berg's romanticism more impressive than in his other works, I think. It is also said to be based on various games with the number three, alluding to the trinitry of Second Viennese School. Stravinsky is as energetic, witty and masterful as we know him in the concerto and eight miniatures, each a masterpiece. Overall, a magnificient disk. Nobody interested in modern music should miss it."
1,It sucked,The Real name of this book should be Wuthering Bites. This book is a piece of poo and there is no exciting parts. The whole book pretty much bit and I will never read it again.
4,"Fischer-Dieskau ""Winterreise""","Thanks to whoever has ""extolled it's virtues"", and they're (the virtues) great. There's, at least, one other recording that compares (or surpasses) - an old one by the Danish tenor Aksel Schiotz (long unavailable). In any case, this (the Fischer-Dieskau) is probably the best of what's available."
4,A beautiful classical religious CD,"I chose this CD because I love Dieter Fischer Diskau's voice. I will admit that I'm not familiar with this very classical style of religious music, and of course I don't understand the German language, but the more I listen to it the better I like it."
5,Wonderful glasses!,"I am thoroughly pleased with these glasses, they are beautifully done and sturdy as well. The whole set is fantastic, -great for any contemporary/casual kitchen theme."
4,an excellent read,"If one is interested in the history of Ireland, the book supplies a unique glimpse into the people involved in the uprising and beginning of the Abbey Theatre- and Colm Toibin's writing is always a treat."
3,zoro vs zolo,"i had a hard time rating this because as a rule, i love one piece and want to support the magnaka. however, i HATE viz medias translation and misspronunciation of characters names (zoro-zolo, ace-trace). i know that in japanese zoro and zolo are almost the same, but eiichiro oda wrote his name in english several times and it was always zoro. the story itself is interesting and fun, though it gets much darker later on. i would rate the story a 5 and viz medias translation as a 2 so it evened out at three. i have no intention of buying another viz media translated manga.maybe i'll start collecting the actual japanese version, though, because the story is fantastic."
5,Just what you'd expect from a pirate themed adventure story.,"Pirates, swearing, and action. Hopefully everyone will be expecting these three things when they purchase this series.Not only is there action, but also a ton of comedy. I laughed myself hoarse during a few scenes of One Piece and I don't think it's humanly possible NOT to find at least one thing funny in this series.Not for young children since there are some adult situations, comedy, and violence, but for ages 15+ this manga/anime is a must."
5,Pirates are FUNNY!!!,"One piece is the hilarious story of a man named Luffy who wants to be the best pirate ever. But, by accident he ate the fruit of the devil and now he's a rubber man who will never learn to swim. If you think THAT stopped him, than you just don't know Monkey D. Luffy!!One Piece is a great story that is wildly popular in Japan, and for good reason! The antics are both extremely funny, and incredibly engaging. One Piece is originaly found in Shonen Jump, but now with the graphic novel out, more people can enjoy the awesome manga experience that is One Piece!...13"
3,okay book,okay condition when i got it in the mail the only problem was there was dirt on the cover and it smelled like ramen soup ;) but the smell went away after a day or so and the cover only took a minute to clean
4,Not as good as Naruto but great as a stand-alone!,"Im sorry but ninjas are cooler then pirates. And arguably Naruto has a better leading character and better support characters. This is a close second but since Naruto is now getting its own show on Cartoon Network I feel it has a bit more of an edge. This is definatelly a great manga thought, dont be afraid to try it. Just do me a favor and try Naruto as well. =)"
2,this is lame .....,"They changed the formula for this pill after having sold them for more than 14 YEARS with the lemon bioflavonoid complex 500mg (you used to get the vitamin c 500mg and the lemon bioflavonoid at the same time in the same pill -- two for one) ..... this was really good for my lung problems (inflammation in my lungs) NOW they are selling the 500mg bioflavonoid complex separately. This C-500 has only a token amount of bioflavonoid (90mg). It no longer says ""proudly made in the USA"" either on the bottle.I don't trust this company any longer and I'm switching brands."
2,check the band b4 you buy,Got a casio wave ceptor watch with metal band for Christmas with a similar wrist band design- the band pulled apart at the case the first day. The metal pin that holds the band on is attached to the case with a cheap rubbery plastic peice that rips out easily. Check with casio or other reviews to confirm that this watch has a better system!The worst part is if you look at Casio's warrentee the band and case are not covered.My watch is now held together with epoxy - very fashionable! Goes good if you have glasses held together with masking tape.
5,i love this watch!,"this watch is nice and big, i am 6'3"" 245 lbs and this watch fits my wrist nicely, it also works great. nice purchase."
4,Dense but Entertaining,"I kept waiting for Wolfe to share with us what would make Eugene the writer he was waiting to be - where would he find the courage to not only fail (or fail again) but to believe in himself and know that he could write after reading the thousands of books he gorged himself on.And then as the book winds down, it happens, he falls in love. And in a few paragraphs, we learn that the momentual problems of the past were wiped away. He finds his courage and the book ends abruptly. Perhaps a little more editing earlier would have led Wolfe to write more about this episode.I enjoyed the novel though not as much as the prequel."
4,Patch up?,"This is a rather hysterical novel. Chapters of poetic descriptions of seasons and places seem to be indispersed among some sort of narrative. Characters are introduced in great detail and then vanish, sometimes to return later on. Wolfe was a feverish writer used to bursts of inspiration who had to [reluctantly] allow his publisher [Perkins] to edit his voluminous manuscript down to some sort of logical sequence. This shows in both this novel and its preceding volume [LOOK HOMEWARD]. The story is semi-autobiographical. The writing is, in a strange sort of way, unique."
4,You'll love your Pfaltzgraff April 20-piece dinnerware!,"I absolutely love my new April 20-piece dinnerware from Pfaltzgraff. It is elegant, versatile, has the impressive Pfaltzgraff name and quality. I wrote a very detailed, informative review on this dinnerware, that should cover anything you would ever want to know and more.I am a Top Reviewer and advisor for the Epinions consumer review site in Home & Garden and other areas. Please feel free to read my review and profile links (photo of me also!)noted below. I am also happy to answer your questions about the product or the website. Thanks.Suzi<..."
1,Refill Card Expiration violates Hawaii Prepaid/Giftcard Laws,"I purchased $100 worth of T-Mobile prepaid refill card. When I attempted to redeem, I was told it's invalid. I reported the problems to T-mobile customer representative and supervisor by calling 877-778-2106. I provided the purchase receipt, order number, amount paid, and all other information requested. After lengthy conversations with the representatives, they noted that my order is verified and it is in their records. However, they were unwilling to issue replacement cards or refund. Reason provided for not crediting the prepaid refill cards was that it was more than 90 days old, and their policy is that the cards expired. Hawaii law prohibits Gift card/prepaid cards with expiration less than 5 years. Filed complaint with statte Attorney General's Office."
4,an inside look at a turning point.....,"I was fortunate to recieve the DVD and was amazed that Darren was so open and intimate about all that was going on in his life, him dealing with a solo career that he was unprepared for, his hopes and fears,and having the wherewithall to handle it without going over the edge. I totally respect him for sticking it out the way he did, and I am glad it has all come together the way it has.The concert itself was good, singing songs from Spin, and a few Savage Garden songs, and especially Insatiable live it sounds so good! You will throughly enjoy the DVD If you are a fan or you just want to know what Darren was going through in the winter of 2002."
1,Beware of the DVD region,I ordered this DVD unaware that it was coded for a different region than the U.S. It wouldn't work on a standard US DVD player.
2,"Dry, But Scholarly: An Important Architectural Survey","First, a warning: do not buy this book if you're thinking of curling up by the fire at home during the weekend, lying back, and learning about the colorful and exotic world of ancient Pompeii and foreign Roman society via colorful and provocative pictures of ruins and paintings.This book is purely an architectural study. But it's material like this that's used by other writers to scribe the interesting books with lotsa pictures. Hey, I didn't enjoy reading it during my Pompeii class, I probably wouldn't have read it at all if the Prof hadn't assigned it, but it helped me to familiarize the city of Pompeii and its principal ruins. And I'm not saying that I did great in the class either, but the book helped.There are no pictures. But anyone who's REALLY interested in Pompeii should read this.Also, buy the paperback: it's much less expensive and easier to carry. Peace."
5,Miraculous!,The collaboration between Argerich and Abbado is impressive. Argerich is at her best. A must for your classical collection.
2,Tripped,"The Prokoviev 3rd is played in Argerich' usual performance style:she practically trips over the notes in order to get to the next one. Nuance, emotional interpretation are nearly non-existent (except for those who equate musical interpretation and emotingas the production of speed on the keyboard). Prokoviev obviouslyexpected speed where it is called for in this piece, but I hardlythink that he would have enjoyed his music being trampled upon. Even the expert downhill racer appreciates the style of his craftand wouldnt consider himself a better skier if took the mountainon a ski jump."
3,Its sounds enough like it to be recognized but is so noisy!,"This recording is unpleasantly cacophonic at times. The best performance of this piece I've ever heard was by a player named Steven Mason Prutsman. I was so mesmerized by his playing that I would listen and relisten to the song over and over again. I don't know if he has any recordings. I recorded the music on tape off of a video recording of the 1990 Tschaikovsky competition in Moscow, Russia."
4,wedding gift success,"I was hesitant to buy these dishes at first after reading the other reviews about the horrible packing, but the price could not be beat anywhere else (including the pfaltzgraff site). I bought these as a wedding gift for a friend, so I made sure to order way in advance in case I needed to return items. The dishes were beautiful, and fully intact. However, amazon should do a better job when shipping these items. Although the dishes were securely packed in the pfaltzgraff box, The amazon box around the dishes did not contain any extra padding, and was banged up a bit on the corners. Aside from this, the item itself is great!"
1,Will never buy Pfaltzgraff again,"I also have been terribly dissapoointed with the Cappucino dinnerware. Horrible silverware marks almost immediately after I purchased it. They look great but a high maintenance product. I called the company to compalin and they sent me a cleaner, which did NOT work. It is really a shame because the company has the best serving pieces. Would have loved to have been a customer for life but now looking to replace with Sango. Horrible product and worse service. They should have issued me a credit and should have stopped manufacturing this line. They know perfectly well that they are having problems with the Cappucino brand."
4,More to green than to tan,"I ordered 2 sets of this dinnerware - had 3 destroyed plates and 2 chipped bowls out of 32 pieces. Would like to mention that we feel the color actually has a greenish (very pale celadon) tint to it - not bad if you like green, but really can't refer to this as a true shade of tan, as ""cappuccino"" implies."
5,Multiple Breaks,"These dishes are wonderful, I ordered 2 sets but it took about a month before getting a set that didnt have broken pieces in it. Just allow plenty of time for this and you'll be happy. The customer service reps at Amazon were very helpful....the people who pack at the warehouse need better instruction on packing techniques."
2,"Not happy with ""silverwear marks""","I bought a huge set of these, some from Amazon and some from Marshall Fields. Unfortunately, the plates and smaller dishes began to show tons of silvery/gray marks from silverwear almost immediately. I was so dissappointed that I asked at Marshall Fields and the employee said that the glaze is not thick enough on the stoneware and that she had heard similar complaints from others. The only way to get it off (and not even completely) is to scrub them for a long time with ""BarKeepers Friend"" or a similar powder. I thought I was going to have this set forever, but I'm now shopping for something new. I'm almost embarrassed to serve company with them. The plates are quite big and rather heavy. But the shape of the bowls and cups are nice. Too bad."
2,Amazon doesn't know how to ship,"I had a wedding gift registry set up with Amazon and included with many other kitchen essentials were several pieces from the Pfaltzgraff Cappuccino collection.Having dealt with Amazon for years in ordering books for university, I thought Amazon had it together when it came to packing and shipping. Unfortunately, that only applies to their books. Several of my shipments arrived damaged, including a large set of Calphalon cookware. Cracked dishes, repacking, and trips to the UPS store were not what I had in mind in the weeks before my wedding.And to think all this could have been avoided had Amazon invested in a few rolls of ""FRAGILE"" sticker tapes."
1,not happy dinnerware,"This is a bad copy of the original dinnerware from Pfaltzgraff The color was off, the dinner plates were all uneven so bad it was hard to stack the plates togther I flipped the plates over to see what the problem was. These were made in China? Pfaltzgraff is a USA product There is nothing on the Amazon 's website stating they were a copy cat dinnerware that was coming from China. I will spend the money for the good quality dinnerware. If you are thinking you're getting a good deal guess again!! You get what you paid for I learn my lesson the hard way."
2,The China product is just a bit different than the USA product,"We purchased a partial set of this dinnerware last year and it was made in the USA. We completed the set and it is now made in China. We were very disappointed because we support USA products and this was a big part of our decision for the initial purchase. The China product is a bit different. The accent color is precise with each color being separate and distinct from each other where the USA product colors are mottled and blended together, looking artsy and having a pleasing meld of color. Also, the items from China have more irregularity in shape and the coffee cups came with two different handles.We decided to let it go rather then have half a set and over time replace them. We do enjoy the large proportions of this set and the nice heft they have."
2,Terrible,I was really disappointed with this product. I should have taken the other reviews more seriously. I have chips and crack in half the set (I bought 2 sets). They are heavy and scuff easily. I would not recommend buying these.
1,not made in the usa,"they advertise this product made in the usa, it is not! the usa plates are great the china made are not"
3,Big,Almost too big to fit in our dishwasher! And the cereal/salad bowls are huge. These really don't fit in the dishwasher and almost always are done by hand.
1,Very poor quality,"I purchased 3 sets from a local department store. I owned Pfaltzgraff's Heritage dishes for 20 years and loved them. But this line is horrible quality. Read the reviews people....they break, chip, and scratch easily. I have owned these for about 3 years and I do not have a single plate that plate that is not chipped. I can get the scratches out with the Pfaltzgraff polish but I have to do it often. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
3,A delightful gem for book lovers,"Lynne Schwartz' ""Ruined by Reading"" has languished on my bookshelf for quite some time while I continued to read the latest bestsellers. I regret that I did not read this delightful essay on the joys of reading earlier. Filled with anecdotes about her childhood and her initial exposure to books, this paen to reading reminds us of how we felt as children when we first entered the kingdom of books and were whisked away from the ""here and now"" to enchanted lands. As I read her book, I was taken back to the two-room schoolhouse as a teacher exposed us to Long John Siver and ""Treasure Island"". I also recalled reading Leon Uris' ""Exodus"" as a teenager and the profound impact it had in shaping my view of the world and the evil that humans are capable of. No doubt you too will be reminded of similar experiences if you choose to read this delightful little gem for book lovers."
3,Something of a disappointment,"I am a bibliophile, an unrepentant booklover, so I was really looking forward to this book. I was disappointed. Not only did Schwartz reveal very little about herself, it also seemed we didn't read many of the same kinds of books. Frankly, we just didn't ""connect."" There was a lot more about Heidi and A Little Princess than I ever wanted to know. If you want a good book about books and reading and an excellent memoir at the same time, try Wendy Werris's An Alphabetical Life. As a ""book about books"" this one simply didn't work form me. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY: AT PLAY IN THE ASA"
2,Incredibly boring,I found Ms. Schwartz's book to be boring. I did not think it described reading very well. She wanders off the topic and uses the same examples over and over. I enjoy reading about reading but had to force myself to finish this one. I did not find that I had much in commom with her or that I even read the same way.
5,Every new Foxtrot collection is a reason for rejoicing!,"Jason, Paige and Peter just keep getting funnier and funnier with every new collection. It's amusing to watch Jason dealing with pre-puberty - he just can't deal with the fact that he's actually attracted to a (gasp) girl! As with the previous collection, ""Death by Field Trip,"" this is in a smaller-size format than the older collections, but as far as I can tell it's the same number of strips, and the smaller size makes it easier to hide behind your textbooks when you want to read it in class!"
5,A whimsical collection,"Fans of the newspaper cartoon Foxtrot are in for a surprise in this collection, which portrays the sleuthing duo of Jason and Marcus as they follow clues to finding a thief. Encyclopedia Brown And White provides a whimsical collection of their unusual sleuthing abilities in a title all ages will enjoy."
2,Stupid,"This used to be funny, but this adition sinks too a new low point, a lot of the jokes are unfunny and unoriginal, most of them are recycled from previous Foxtrot comic strips..."
4,Dated but useful info,Basic book on Sonicwall products with an overview of their product line. This book needs an update as many new products have been released and are not listed. Many of the devices listed are now at end of life or nearing such status. Would Not recommend this book if you are interested in the new TZ190 line or the NSA product line as the book has nothing on these products!
2,Not much more help than the user's guide,"Did not provide enough detail for novices using a firewall. Probably due to the book's coverage of the entire Sonicwall line. Screen captures and step-by-step sections did not match up with my TZ170's settings for VPN set up. In addition, some options were not discussed at all. I have experience with a couple other firewalls so I was able to get the VPN working. This book has proven to be of little value."
1,Look ANYWHERE else,"Thinking SonicWall? Think again! I have a SonicWall unit that is less than 10 months old. It hasn't worked for 3 months. The tech support is out of the US, has unbelievably long wait times (as long as 50 minutes wait on one call) and when you finally do get through they are not only absolutely useless, bu they refuse to honor their warranty! RUN AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!"
2,Geared to the Young Reader,"Aristotle for Everybody is a brief introduction to Aristotle aimed at the young reader. Its target audience is probably the inquisitive student in the 12-14 range who is seeking an overview of Aristotelian thought.I accidentally picked up this book after glancing at a couple of the reviews on this site. I was about to re-read some Aristotle and was seeking to re-acquaint myself with his particular style and language. This is definitely not the book for this purpose.Adler's text is clearly geared to the young reader who has not been introduced to philosophy. I do not mean this to be disrespectful but to help oher readers avoid by mistake. Adler, himself notes in the introduction that his initial thought was to title the work Aristotle for Children. Indeed for the young reader this may not be an inappropriate mechanism for introducing Aristotle."
1,TOO BAD SHAPE TO SELL TO SOMEONE,"I DO NOT THINK I WILL BUY ANY USED BOOK AGAIN, IT WAS JUST TOO OOOOOOOOOOOOLD."
3,Yuck,"The purchase was made after viewing the Dr. Oz show. Brewers yeast was recommended. I read the previous reviews, some stated that this was the best tasting brewer's yeast they had found. So, I figured I would try it out. Yuck!!! I attempted to eat the brewer's yeast with some cereal, and I could not get it down. Would love to incorporate this into my daily foods, but I may need to find a food that will cover up the taste!"
4,Did not work to boost milk supply,"I purchased it to help with my breast milk supply, well, it did not work for me. Seems like a quality product. I tried it first with warm milk and was amazed at how repulsive it tasted. On the other hand it was surprisingly nice on yogurt with granola. I hope it works for others."
3,Brewers yeast,"Ok I guess, I wasn't aware that one taste of these would be my last, tastes terrible, but that was my own lack of research."
1,Lewis Labs brewers yeast powder,"The product is called ""flakes"" but the product is a powder, it is not flakes. It also tastes very bad. Brewer's yeast flakes taste very wholesome and is a totally different product."
5,This is one of the better ones.,I have sampled many brands of Brewer's yeast in my day and I have to say that this is one of the better tasting ones. My dogs love it too. (I share with them) It's supposed to help keep ticks and flees away so I heard. I just put about a teaspoon or more (16 and 21 lb. dogs) in their food and they gobble it up.Great source of B vitamins for me and hubby - just throw in our daily smoothy.It took about 6 days or so to get to me from seller. Pretty good considering all the bad weather going on due to hurricanes.
1,Not what I was expecting,"The description of this product tecnically is correct. I guess I should have known from the price that this was not the ""game"" I grew up with. The original game I played 30 years ago belonged to my father and came with bidding cards (at least the size of the playing cards, maybe a bit bigger) and plastic holders to display the bidding cards. This set came with a sub-par deck of cards, 4 bidding wheels (flimsy cardboard discs w/ numbers written on them) and 4 bidding wheel ""holders"" that can best be described as empty matchbook covers with a notch cut out to display the bid. The worst part is I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Father (I actually bought 2 of them so my dad, my 3 sisters, my wife, my 10 year old daughter and I could all play at once. We play rounds starting w/ 1 card, up to 7 cards and back down to 1 card). I'm probably going to return them."
1,Worst Computer Ever Because of Sony Customer Service,"I have never been so dissapointed by a customer service program. My computer died last year and they made me pay more than 100.00 to perform a recovery on the computer. This could have easily been acheived by providing the consumer, after they pay almost 2000.00 with the disks needed to reinstall the programs the computer came with. Instead they expect you to creat a recovery disk. Then to make the story even better. I go to create a recovery disk for next time and I eat through 20 Dvd's trying to make it work. Their solution is for me to uninstall 3 of my programs that they installed and then try again. Long story short. It never worked. Stick to Dell or Apple. I still have a Dell that I bought 5 years ago, and whenever anything goes wrong they will even come to your house to fix it. I paid the original warranty, same as I did with the sony, but the service speaks for itself. Sony should be ashamed of themselves."
2,plain white t - not!,My teenage daughter loved the shirt. The deliver was quick and the product as expected.
5,Hair,"I have enjoyed using Nixon products for many years and have many, many compliments on my hair and always tell everyone how I achieved my thicker fuller hair at 55!!!!!!!!!"
5,Love It!,"We bought this toy for our 1 year-old daughter. Her daddy is a drummer and she loves music. This is the best of it's kind out there. It is so durable, and safe for even little ones. The mallet has large, rounded ends so (even though she is teething and puts everything in her mouth)she will not stick it too far in as to choke. The pegs that hold the metal bars on are soft rubber so no sharp parts there either. The whole instrument is surrounded by rounded plastic with a nice handle and a place on the bottom to snap on the mallet. The bright colors are nice for her, and we like that it is accurately tuned and labeled. Our daughter loves this toy and we are confident that it is a toy that she will play with for many years to come. We are very happy with our choice."
5,Just what we were looking for,"This toy is just what we were looking for for our 9 month old daughter. It plays notes clearly, has no sharp edges, a spot to keep the mallet when not in use. And, the mallet is one solid piece which means I don't have to worry about my daughter choking on any small parts that may come off when she chews it! I only wish it had come with more song sheets for when she is older, but there are some on the website we can download and I'm sure we can find more elsewhere."
4,"Great toy, but watch the mallet!","I agree with all the positive comments about the Glockentoddler - it's very sturdy, and the sound is great. I got this for a 9 month-old knowing he was a too small for it, but didn't think he could hurt himself with the plastic mallet. Luckily I was watching because he kept chewing on the mallet and, as others have noted can happen, the end was nearly severed on the morning he got it! We replaced the mallet with a wooden stick from his Melissa and Doug ""Band in a Box"" which works fine (no chipped paint and sounds okay). So great toy - but watch out if younger siblings are around or you have a chewer."
3,"Great performance, poor remastering","Previous reviews extoll the virtues of Richter's performance, and indeed it is magnificent. Unfortunately, the remastering of this recording did not produce a quality result. The dynamics are poor, resulting in fuzzy strings, and horns and a less than vibrant sound from Richter's piano. There is no sense of ""presence"". This is a valuable recording for those with two or more copies of the Rach 2, who want this one as a historic performance or for collectors of Richter. If this is your first copy and you have a decent sound system, steer clear."
5,Picture says a thousand words,This book is the best textbook I've used for Nuclear Medicine images. The students love it and so do I! It is to the point and easy to read concerning practical imaging information.
3,Absolute necessity.,"I purchased this from Amazon.com simply because Sears had my order for over a month without being able to fulfill it. Amazon had not problem and the price was right. Without this part I couldn't mow my lawn, and I didn't want to buy another mower just to get my lawn under control."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book was a very disconnected account of a Holocaust survivor from his childhood to present day. The book provides meaningless details throughout and is written without emotion. The read is very easy, but the book leaves you with nothing. The Holocaust was a horrific event, but that is not reflected at all in this book. Perhaps the author is disconnected from emotion because of the terror he lived through in concentration camps. Despite this possibility, the book was nothing like I imagined and I would never recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Karajan's 1966 ""Pictures"" is highly overrated","If not for the excellent recordings of ""La Mer"" and ""Bolero"" (both worthy of 5 stars) this would be a one star review. The trumpet playing in ""Pictures"" is unacceptable by modern standards. The ""Samuel Goldenberg"" track is particularly bad. It is poorly articulated and out of tune. For reasons I can't explain, continental orchestras of this period lagged far behind their British and American counterparts in the area of brass playing. You should still buy this recording for ""La Mer"" and ""Bolero,"" but look elsewhere for ""Pictures."" Better choices include (but are by no means limited to) Szell/Cleveland, Reiner/Chicago, and even Mata/Dallas. Karajan's earlier recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra is far superior to this offering on DG, and offers excellent brass playing throughout. It is available as part of the ""Karajan 100th"" box on EMI."
4,Very good performance,"This CD contains some fantastic music very well-performed and is thus quite enjoyable. On a reference-quality stereo system, the age of the original master is apparent, with a somewhat diminished dynamic range and stereo imaging/soundstage, but the music does not disappoint."
2,Heritage Covered Butter Dish,"I am enjoying using my new Heritage dinnerware including the covered butter dish. The only part I am not 100% satisfied with is how the cover sits on top of the butter dish bottom. Due to the narrow design of the bottom piece the top does not fit evenly into the bottom piece. Not a serious flaw but one I can see. When the dish is being used, usually only the bottom is passed so it is not apparent to anyone else. Other wise is does it's job."
3,Forever Knight based on this movie,"The TV show 'Forever Knight' is based on this movie. In fact, the two hour premiere for the series is almost identical. There were changes of course, but I would recommend anyone who enjoyed the show, to see this movie and add it to their collection."
1,Horrible,"Absolutely a waste of time and money. Effects were horrible. If I had not seen the television series first, I would never ever have bothered with this film. It amazes me that such lousy film could ever have been the basis of a successful television series."
2,"Retread, even if it did come first.","I remember watching the first season of Forever Knight (FK) when it was broadcast on network television. I stayed up late just to make sure I caught it.I had heard rumors of a TV movie that came before it, with Rick Springfield in the title role, but I couldn't ever actually find it anywhere.Then along comes my savior Netflix and I have the chance to see, what I believed, was a pilot movie for the show.Boy was I wrong.Less than 5 minutes into this, I was quoting right along with it. Word. For. Word.Needless to say, I was less than thrilled.I suppose there's some amusement at seeing the slight differences between this and the first two episodes of FK, but I was just annoyed at having wasted my time to watch it.I was even more annoyed at Mr Slan and Mr Parriot for not even bothering to change anything. Given the creative writing and very enjoyable episodes of FK, one or two more hour long shows couldn't have been -that- much of a chore."
2,I remember this being better,"Ok, this was the pilot that after a good number of changes became the cult classic tv show ""Forever Knight"". Rick Springfield did fine but I'm glad the television show got rid of most of the actors except for our dear friend Detective Skanky -- what a name to be stuck with in life. The first two episodes of the television series basically redoes this movie so you dont' need to get it as a supplment. But if you watched when it was on tv like I did you may want it as a momento."
2,At first they didn't succeed.,"Entirely forgettable precursor to the ""Forever Knight: TV Series about a vampire trying to atone for past sins by becoming a police officer and fighting against evil. (and also trying to kick that nasty blood habit)The writing is poor and the story is not compelling. Save your money and get the real deal from the sci-fi series rather than this poor first attempt."
1,I thought it to be a rather dark piece for network TV,Sad to say that I had this on tape when it was aired originally on CBS. it is a Nobol effort for Rick to try and get a new series started. It does not seem to be the best story out there..He played a man who was under the vampire curse. He is trying to find a way to become a mere mortal again while balancing a case where people are being killed for their blood......P>The only thing Rick had going for him was his looks and the great songs that were added in....
3,Sasitsfied,this purchase came new and on time. It was packaged as it should be and it plays well no scratches on disk therefor I was happy with my purchase.Thank YouBarb
3,good and bad,Some scenes are good and some scenes I didn't care for. I wanted to see this after watching all three seasons of the FK series (thanks to Netflix). I really like some of the songs in this movie. Didn't care for the guy part that's Dr. Lambert in the series.
2,So-so,"Looks good initially, but the plates scratch easily from dinner knives. We've had other stoneware before, but this didn't live up to our expectations. We now have the Taos pattern and it's holding up much better."
5,I Can Read,This easy to read book is an excellent addition to any classroom or home library for young readers. Target audience would be first grade students who are learning how to read. I find this book a great motivator for children in my class. The rhyming format helps children recognize word patterns and raises confidence in their reading abilities.
4,Wanted to give this 5 stars...,"... but I cannot, based on the oftentimes sluggish tempi, and the absolutely horrendous performance of ""Olim lacus colueram"" by Stolze. Fischer-Dieskau is excellent, as always, and Janowitz remains, in my opinion, one of the most egregiously overlooked sopranos of the last century or so. This CD is worth buying for her sparkling renditions of ""Stetit Puella,"" ""In trutina,"" and ""Dulcissime"" alone."
1,bad recording,"The audio is terrible. At first it's so soft you can't hear it, and when you turn up the volume, the next section is too loud and you have to turn down the volume. You shouldn't sell this item."
5,What can I say?,"This is the ultimate Carmina Burana rendition for the millennium. Eugen Jochum handles the orchestra and choir superbly and the soloists Fischer-Dieskau, Stolze, and Janowitz perform with first-rate magnificence. There have been other recordings (Dutoit, Thielemann, and Pople) that are also brilliant through presentation, but these simply do not come close to Jochum's excellent version. This one gets an A+ from me. Absolutely outstanding."
4,Misrepresentation,"This is not about the recording but more about Amazon. I just recently bought this item and I have to say that the sample recordings featured on this page is NOT the same recording on the CD. I can't find a way to contact Amazon, but I thought I'd let everyone know."
1,Is the the same edition everyone else is reviewing?,"The performance might be wonderful, but the recording seems sonically challenged. The dynamics and range just seems thin. I was just expecting such a huge spectacle to produce a huge rich sound. But maybe I'm too corrupted by rock music."
4,Great Read,"I am not usually a fan of this genre, but I'm glad I made an exception in the case of UX-6000. I was impressed with the technical details which demonstrated the special expertise of the author. This seemed to be a product of experience as well as research. How timely is this story about terrorist threats! It was also satisfying on the level of plot, action, and character. Try it, you'll like it!"
1,DOA and Warranty Voiding Mischief,"Are they still selling these? And at a higher price? I ordered one, which arrived with the front panel broken. Bad, because this panel is part of the sealed compartment, effectively voiding the warranty. Amazon sent a replacement, which arrived not only with the panel also broken, but it would not even power on! I e-mailed them again and they said ""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however, I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed."" I am still waiting for UPS to pick up the 2nd A/C, 30+ days later. Hope you have better luck than I did!"
2,Nice Cover...,"...and nice songs too. However, if you're looking for any Diana Krall inside, find another book. Very misleading on Hal Leonard's part. Included are the standard arrangements of these songs: words, chords and a stock arrangement. Fine if that's what you want. But it's nothing like her CD's. If you have a few books of standards you may already have some these arrangements. There is a book with sketch scores including some piano solo passages of Diana's work. Look on European sheetmusic websites."
1,One of the most boring books I have read.,"This book was recommended to me since I love mysteries, crimes and court room battles. This was one of the slowest books I have ever read and was very painful to complete. As a matter of fact, I read five other books before finishing this. My brother and I trade books since we have about the same taste and I apologized to him before he began reading this book. I could not believe it was so highly rated in the reviews."
2,No thanks,"I reviewed this title for my public library. The plot and writing are erratic; sometimes good but sometimes really bad. The title has some components of a good mystery, but overall it just doesn't work.If the author's future titles are more cohesive, I would consider buying them for my library."
5,Favorite Atticus Book,"As a fan of Greg Rucka's comic work (Queen & Country and Whiteout), I was not let down when I started on his Atticus Kodiak series. Critical Space is my favorite with Smoker right on it heal. Rucka creates characters that are damaged and exceptional. His prose is concise and descriptive and his dialog is witty.If you enjoy Rucka's Atticus Kodiak books, do not hesitate to pick up his Queen & Country novels."
5,Non-stop action,"This was my first action/thriller book. I enjoy action movies so I gave this a try. I really enjoyed it, and found it difficult to put down. I also read another book in the Atticus Kodiak series (""Smoker"") because I enjoyed it so much. My favorite part is where Atticus is training with Drama for the upcoming encounter with the assassin. I really felt that I was there inside Atticus' head training with him. The way Rucka described the way his body was changing and how he started to notice more details about the physical appearance and movement of others was extremely intense."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Nice, flowing, easy to read prose. Hilarious 21st century lack of time spent editing mistake : 'on the fench' - new word, hybrid of bench and fence? :)Bodyguard and crew is broke, ex-SAS mate does him a favor, gets a high profile gig, saves client in a high profile situation on film.Lots more work done. Old job comes back to haunt him, a pro assassin that tried to kill him is being hunted herself, and uses him to save her life. This assassin is a woman, so Atticus' girlfriend is not happy.It ends in blood."
5,My first Rucka book and the very best,"When people ask me to recommend a book, this one is near the top of the list, in the company of authors such as Michael Crichton, Jack London (The Sea Wolf), Tolkien, and Catherine Coulter. (An esoteric list, yes. I read a lot, but I don't write about books I don't like.)This was the first book by Greg Rucka that I picked up, on the recommendation of a friend, and after I finished it, I couldn't wait to read the others. While they're good, I keep coming back to this one because it is very enjoyable, very compelling, and bears reading more than once. If you like action, suspense, and mystery, you'll love this book."
4,Making the Preposterous into the Believable,"This book shouldn't work. The plot is a lot less realistic than those in previous Rucka works, but somehow Rucka pieces it together in a way that you can almost for how ridiculous some of the story in.In this installment, Atticus Kodiak is now famous and his adventures involve a starlet, an activist heiress from England, and the shadowy world of assassins. Much of the work is about a series of life-altering experiences for Atticus that shouldn't rign true at all, as they border on the preposterous. But I turned the pages, my doubts were shoved aside and the action took off. Rucka brings a lot of what he's used as a novelist and as a writer of rather down-to-earth comic books into every page and every plot twist. When the book ends, the reader is left in shock at what's become of Atticus, and can't wait to see what Rucka does next with him."
3,"good, in specific situations","I prefer Bartlett's for one major reason: You know where what you're looking for came from. There's plenty of good material in here, don't get me wrong, but if it's a Shakespeare quotation, I like to know *exactly* where it came from in MacBeth, so I can find it and cite it!It does have an interesting organization-- by theme-- which is different from Bartlett's and can make flipping through it amusing. In that way, you can actually pick this up and just browse instead of reading 16 pages of lines from Paradise Lost, all together.However, if you're looking for something practical, something you can use to give people an answer if they ask you, ""Hey, that was interesting, where did it come from, exactly?,"" you're not going to be able to answer the ""exactly"" part. Just be aware of that."
2,just okay,"The author retells a story over and over from different points of view. I can't quite get to the end of the book, I've lost interest."
5,Cute & sturdy,"The chair arrived today and so far I really like it. It was fully assembled, so all I had to do was pull it out of the box and remove the plastic it was wrapped in. Seems to be well-made and does look just like the photo. My daughter, who is 15 months, immediately went to sit in it. I got the dark green one, and I do like that it looks like a small version of an ""adult"" piece of furniture. Not everything for kids, girls especially, needs to be pink or brightly colored. I will post an update after we've had it awhile to report on how it's holding up."
5,Good looking chair for toddler,"Got this today and within mins my kid sat in it and likes it. The color is even better. It is more of a hunter green than what is shown in the picture. So, it's darker which I am sure will help in hiding stains. Nicely constructed, one of the leg is a little off balance but it's easy to fix, by adjusting the felt. Overall, I am very satisfied with the chair. Will update after a few weeks of use."
1,VIP Chair,"The package came to me in a timely manner and the price was excellent if it had been a nice chair but the chair only weighed 13.5 lbs and it came in a little box I know it had to be assembled but this was suppose to be a chair for my livingroom weighing only 13.5 lbs, my computer chair weighs more, I was so disappointed. I don't recommend buying furniture from Amazon.com until they get better items in. I would give this zero rating but since I had to put something I give it a 1 star rating for extremely bad."
4,Pleased with this Item,I was pleased with this product when it arrived. It seems to be of good quality and I had no problems thus far. Only drawback in my opinion the replacement filters are a little pricey.
5,Cascade 200 Filter!!,"OH MAN! This filter is the quietest filter I've ever bought! The build is sturdy and everything about this product is just so AWESOME for the price I got it for! Which was under $20!! I bought this filter for my 50gal aquarium because the other filter I have ""Whisper Power Filter 40"" Was TOO NOISY! It's cover rattled while in use and omg...so annoying. But the cascade 200 power filter...I can't ask for a better filter! Thanks guys for making a good and silent filter!"
2,Its ok,I recently bought the filter i find the 200 filter could hardy work good on my 27 gallon tank.I recommend to buy a cascade 300 filter on a 25 - 40 gallon tankI'm using the and every 5 days i have to change the filter and and do a 70 to 85 precent water change buy something better
2,Overrated,"I have owned the Cascade 300 (300gph/100g capacity) for over 6 months now, and I dont think it is living up to its ratings. I have a 55g freshwater aquarium (just over half of what this filter is rated for), it is stocked with a large common pleco, a freshwater snowflake eel, and a 14"" Gar. The tank is in no way overstocked, I do regular water changes (about 40-50%), and daily maintenance manually removing any solid waste and whatnot. My tank is continually cloudy, I have tried chemicals, different water source, and even adding extra filter media. Nothing works. I also have another tank with a Top-Fin 60 (rated for only 60g tank) and it has a much higher water flow rate than the Cascade.Maybe I have a bad filter, or its not working properly, but all in all, I am in the market for something different, something of higher quality."
3,Not enough power.,"This product had a difficult time keeping up with my 10 gallon tank. The water was so dirty, so I went and got the Cascade Power Filter 100 and the differance is outstanding. This product would probobly work better with a tank less than 10 gallons."
5,Best price and quality.,Quality filter delivered fast and much more inexpensive than at my local pet supermarket store. Excellent bargain and quality. I ordered the 200 version and it was still cheaper than the 150 version at the local pet store.
5,A Gorgeous Book!,This an absolutely beautiful book! The vintage illustrations of Rome are incredible. Love the descriptions of each illustration in the different languages. I really treasure this book as a work of art.
2,Maybe for older kids.,"I got this for my 4 and 5 1/2 year olds. It's a simple chase game, but after each move you act something out. The acting has nothing to do with the goal of the game. The acting would be fun, but my 4 year old wasn't interested in acting out the card. Instead, he always acted out a plane. My 5 1/2 year old didn't have the refinement in her movement for anyone to guess what she was doing. There are only 6 game pieces, and really no reason they had to be choking hazards. Since they truly are, I have to keep my 1 year old far away. The quality is poor. The cards are flimsy. Maybe 6 or 7 year olds would have the motor skills...but would they have the interest?"
3,Fun but Not Enough Cards,"Our three kids, ages 3.5, 6 and 9 love(d) this game for the first few times we played but there aren't enough cards to keep it interesting once all the existing cards have been acted-out and largely memorized. I contacted the company and, unfortunately, they don't offer for sale supplemental cards that would keep our kids engaged on the game. This would be a relatively easy fix, so unfortunate they don't offer it - would have been 5-stars with option to purchase more cards."
3,fun but geared towards 3-5 year olds,"My 8 year old daughter received this game for christmas and it is very simple. This game is geared toward much younger children. We play this game with her sometimes but the charade cards a super easy, there is no challenge for any of us to act out or guess what the other person is doing. Some of the cards for example are a fish or a telephone or putting on your shoes. Very basic and there are not very many cards to play with. I would say this game would be good for a 3-6 max."
5,"Super game, great for multi-ages!","We were given this for Christmas 2 years ago when our daughter was 2 yrs. old. She was alittle young for it then;but, since 3yrs. old she's been a big fan of this game. She's 4 now and it's a favorite w/ her friends when they come over. They always pull out this game. Mom and dad have fun with it too. Of course, she still doesn't really play by the rules BUT who cares? She's having fun and we always get a great laugh too! Even at age 3 she has been good at acting out the cards...thinking of making up some of our own. I found the quality to be good...Have given and will give it again as b-day gifts! :)"
3,"Great toy, but terrible quality!","My two girls (4 and 2 1/2) LOVE this game. However, the quality is terrible. Taking the game out of the box I had to use packing tape to tape the board down. I tried to e-mail the company and the e-mail bounced back saying they didn't exist. This fact, really upset me. After spending that money, right away it was ""defected"". Other than that, it is a GREAT game!"
5,Grandchildren and parents and friends love this!,"After reading other Amazon reviews, I purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas. Their parents tell me they love it as much as the kids do. I can't wait to play it with them too. I'd agree with the reviews I read and highly recommend it."
3,NO for hot/humid climate,If you live in a climate that is hot and/or humid you will need to stick your face in the aircondition for 15 minutes to be able to get this mask dry and off your face. It cannot be wiped while wet because it is very sticky. I also do not agree with the alcohols that are part of the ingredience list. Everybody knows that alcohol is absolute NO for the skin...but my face did look better after applying this mask and once I got it dry it peeled off nicely.
5,Perfect for modeling,"Small, sharp and precise sprue cutter for plastic models. Spring loaded handles makes cutting quick and effortless.Well built- this tool will definitely outlast my interest in modeling."
5,Contains an excellent treatement of data communication ideas,"This book could be used as text and a reference material for students,teachers and practising engineers and scientists. A clear exposition to the digital communication ideas is contained in this book"
2,Just a novelty.,"I read this book in under 10 minutes.Some interesting advice.The ideal book to give one of your single friends.Just make sure you read it first then you havent wasted your money altogether.There are plenty of books on ""dating"",""picking up girls"",etc from this site."
5,Will Tug at Your Heart,"Kathy Jones has done an excellent job of directing the reader along the various twists and turns of her book through the eyes of a child. As I read the first couple of pages, tears flowed. It's hard for me to understand how an adult -- father to this family -- could leave his children behind without a second glance. But despite my anger, I know it happens every day. Without giving away too many details, let me suffice to say my heart was breaking. Especially when the confused children begin to realize what has just taken place.A River of Stones will make you think like a child, remember like a child, and hurt like only a child can."
2,It's Ok,"I suppose my expectations for this book were too high. While I thought much of the insight was realistic and the characters were somewhat likable, overall I wasn't as impressed as I thought.More than divorce, I found it to be a catalyst to promote Mormonism.I was confused as to whether it was supposed to be written from a child's perspective or an adult-looking-back perspective. There were times when the vocabulary was too large to be from an 11 year old and the sometimes drippy prose was definitely not a child-like quality.What I did appreciate was the lesson that a step-brother, no matter how 'dorky,' can be a great addition to the family. Hopefully, it will help kids reading this book not to see 'new' relatives as a threat or negative."
3,Poignant novel of the trials faced by children of divorce.,"""River of Stones"" is a poignant novel presenting the emotional pitfalls and trials faced by children of divorce. Unfortunately, divorce, with its accompanying tearing of families ties, is an ever growing societal curse. Readers may not be able to slow down the divorce rate but through Jones' book, readers may come to understand the emotional strain, loss and guilt experienced by children of divorce."
4,Tears For Fears meets Keane and Coldplay,"Solid, piano-based songs similar to Keane with production values like Coldplay as if sung by Curt Smith of Tears For Fears."
5,Brits Being Held Back,"Another excellent CD from Embrace. If you look at the British Rock scene, the Brits are truly carrying the mantle of greatness, but they are also having a hard time getting airplay in these hip-hop enamored times. Gomez, Starsailor, Doves, and Embrace, e.g., get pushed to the side, and have problems getting their music out here. Snow Patrol seems to be the exception(and a worthy one). This CD is worth paying the extra price for the import. I'm willing to do this until my fellow Americans clear their ears and hear the quality."
1,"Sadly, It's All Gone Now.","The ""trancendence"" of the ""anthems"" here are entirely FORCED by a band trying too hard to believe in their ability to move people...I guess having a song penned by Chris Martin on your last album will do that.Don't get me wrong, I used to cherish Embrace in a major way...The great moments on their previous album ""Out Of Nothing,"" were quite worthy...But Embrace have had a choppy career at best, and unfortunately when I saw them live in Detroit, they did NOT deliver the goods. What a shame."
4,Good source of sources!,A good source of information about Jewish communities and individual Jews and their relationship with Christians and Muslims during the Middle Ages. The documents and original sources quoted constitute a rich entry to bast world of knowledge for the scholar and the neophyte alike.
2,Poor Quality,"First off, I love these guys. They are perhaps my favorite Reggae act and I was so excited about this dvd/cd. However, the quality of this is really poor. This shouldnt have been released as a commercial product. The dvd is fuzzy and not clear, and the audio is very muffled. It sounds like a bootleg, direct line from the soundboard. You hear it being mixed during the first few songs and it sounds very muffled like it was never mastered. it needs more high end EQ. I'm extremely disappointed in this and I'm disappointed in the band for releasing this. Its very amatuer. I was expecting an awesome box set here. These guys deserve better representation. Bread and Pipe rule, they are very underated in the reggae world, but this product is poor."
1,I do not like this phone!,"This phone has been a pain since we got it. For some reason, placing outgoing calls is one of the hardest things to do on this phone. You dial the number then wait, and wait, and wait, and hopefully you will get a connection."
5,Good Phone for the Price,"I've had this phone for a couple months now and so far so good. I decided to replace my old phone when I need to get a new battery. The cost of this phone was almost less than buying a new phone. The battery life on this phone has been really good. Basic phone, but has good range and volume. Very happy with it so far."
1,This is a bad shopping experience!,"This is a bad shopping experience!The battery packaging is intact.But it does not have the power, It can not drive my Fuji MINI25&#65292; beginning I thought it was the Fuji MINI25 Damaged, but I bought a new battery from Target, prove no problem with my camera.I must warn other buyers, before unpacking shooting video, the preservation of evidence."
2,Past Exp. date,"I receievd these batteries on Dec 28 2011. They seem to work, I can't tell how much charge they have but the expiration date is 0211 so I have to be concerned that as old as they are they will not last long. At the price, it's not worth the hastle to return them."
1,Batteries are fully discharged while packing is intact.,The batteries are received on time and packing was intact.However the batteries were found fully discharged.After looking at the other reviews I think that vendor is hardly concerned about customers & products.Venkat G
5,Plastic Resin Glue,"I use this product in my veneer cold press. I make veneer flat work, small tables and specialize in Parquetry. When I glue veneer to a backer board, I never want it to lift. This glue does just that."
1,Beware old stock.,"Purchase Weldwood from Amazon and NOT from the other dealers listed as associates.In any event, use or test the batch of Weldwood immediately. After three months of laying up a hull(in 2011), I worked into using a half dozen 4.5pound containers marked with tag ""23."" Worthless, they mixed like beachsand. The six containers made a trip to DAP, and returned with the message that they ""were examined and determined by batch number to be 2008 production materials."" So much for a one year guarantee."
2,Very touchy,"This product was purchased for some bent wood lamination work as I had seen David Marks do on ""Woodworks"". I may have misunderstood what he was using because this product did not set up well at all. I mixed by weight and tried to keep the temperature around 70, but the combination of water, dry laminate strips, and a chillier than normal shop all conspired to make a weak bond. I've had far more success in the bent wood lamination game with West System Epoxy as it does not add water and is far less tempermental when it comes to temperature. I would not recommend this product."
5,refreshing,"I remember I bought this cd while vacationing in Paris. I fell in luv with this CD as soon as I heard it, and I have been playing it non-stop.one word, ""beautiful music "", period."
5,The best for WWII naval enthusiasts,"Never mind that the ""flashback"" footage was filmed aboard the U.S. Battleship USS North Carolina, James Cameron has created another masterpiece with this film. Expedition Bismarck is the best Bismarck documentary I have ever seen! James not only dives deep, but he also digs deeper into the mystery surrounding Bismarck's destruction. In this film he goes inside and all around the wreck and films places and things on this ship not seen (mostly) since 1941. He also puts to rest (in my opinion) the long lasting controversy of who actually dealt the final blow that sunk this once mighty ship; the British or the Bismarck's crew. This documentary is a must see!"
2,Durable but not Scratch Resistent,I bought two sets a few years apart and both sets scratched terribly. They are durable and the bowls don't stack well. I really wouldn't recommend this product. My plates look awful and I am embarrassed to put them out.
3,"Dinnerware's nice, but [Amazon.com...]","I do like my dinnerware, tho the bowls are rather awkward and don't stack well. The shapes of the completer pieces I adore...they're gorgeous! (Esp. the salt and pepper) However, it took AT LEAST 4 tries to get my sets...as Amazon.com shippers don't know how to pack dinnerware. They put the boxed set in a bigger box and fill the leftover holes with air-filled packing, not caring about the sides which are unprotected. I'm sorry, but just because you fill the box, doesn't mean it's secure. Dishes WILL break if they're unprotected on even just one side!! It's really just a common-sense issue...why don't the Amazon.com shippers have any? VERY frustrating!"
5,Awesome,"If you ever want to listen to some anointed gospel music, just purchase Cissy Houston album The Definitive Collection. Mostly, when I buy a CD, I only like 2 songs maybe 3. But, when I purchased Cissy Houston CD I liked everyone of them. I see why she won a Grammy for both of those albums from which this collection of songs were compiled.The anointing is sooooo strong, until it just relaxes you. The song, Something is Bound To Happen when you Pray, will make you pray. Whenever I listen to this song, I feel a spirit of prayer. Buy this music and be blessed."
1,BE AWARE!!!,"This version IS NOT the version with the ""EXPLICIT LYRICS"". They use that stupid ""slur"" tactic to hide the original lyrics. That might be fine for the Kids but not for those of us who want to have the versions as they were written by the artist."
1,Avoid these Millenium Cash Ins,"Avoid these stupid Millennium Collection so-called ""best of""They are always copies of an original album with tracks missing, or never a decent pick of greatest hits.Rob already released a best of compilation called ""Past, Present & Future"" which features all the songs found here, plus extra songs not here, and a DVD of video clips with it for only a few bucks more then this one, but worth it.Ignore ANY of these Millennium releases, there just cheap cash-ins."
1,20th century masters,if you are a rob zombie fan or just want to hear what his music is like...do not buy this cd...i did thinking i would have all of his great songs on 1 disc but this was not the case...the songs are there but the quality of duplication is terrible...whatever you do dont play on good systems...spend the money to get the original tracks as they were meant to be...with kick you in the face sound and clarity...the music is unmatched but this cd does not make a good impression on a first time listener...
5,Great Collection,"All the best Rob Zombie songs on 1 cd for a low price, cheaper than dowloading on itunes for sure!"
3,"How is this ""The Best of...""?","I don't get it... I know Rob's albums average 13 tracks, three of which are usually an intro, a transitionary 30 second instrumental, and another instrumental at the end...But why limit this to TWELVE of his singles when an average disc can hold at least 19 to 21 songs, especially at the length of his songs...I love Rob, but I can see no reason at all for this album to even exist.I give it three stars for effort, but otherwise it's just a rehash of what I already have."
3,Zombie,"I give this 3 stars because all the songs can be found on three other CDs already out. There is no new material here. Most of the songs can be found on the Past, Present & Future CD. The last two songs are on the Educated Horses CD. And the song House of 1000 Corpses can be found on the album of the same name. If you want Rob Zombie I would suggest getting the three albums I just mentioned instead of this CD."
3,Good DVD,"Good DVD, but mostly for die hard Maiden fans. Could be a VH1 Behind the Music type (without the drama) doc you see on cable, but since it isn't if you want to see it, buy this vid. I've watched it once and feel smarter for it...but haven't watched it over and over. TNOTB is one of my favs so I had to get it."
4,Good Stuff,I thought this was a very in depth examination of one of the greatest metal albums ever made. The extras are cool too. Adrian Smith shows the chord progressions of a few of the classics. Well Done....
5,Up the Irons,"The really amazing Iron Maiden first Dvd (Raising Hell wasnt so good dvd)...a real must for a Maiden fan,all those rumors you ever heared about The Number Of The Beast album they are all there even Clive Burr got interviwed which i found it to be so cool,well made dvd im happy i got it."
2,ATTENTION: MUSICIANS/ENGINEERS,"About 90% of these reviews are misleading! I was looking for an insight to a classic album especially when I saw Martin Birch (a God!) was involved. But Birch only soloed a couple of tracks in one or two songs and did nothing else! It started off cool with Martin and Bruce talking about how Bruce had to do take after take of the opening to number of the beast but the insight stops there. The interviews are nice(thank-you for the subtitles!-friggin brits!) but it's really a video on Iron Maiden and how this album achieved such great success for the band. If you wanna see a producer AND the band explain an album, buy Judas Priest's classic dvd on British Steel-thanks to Tom Allom. Get the ""History of Iron Maiden-Part 1"" instead of this dvd!!"
1,Don't Buy This if You're Expecting a Concert,"This DVD is 99% interviews and if I had known that, I never would have wasted my money. What a disappointment. Sure its a good documentary of the making of the album, but I was expecting more concert footage. There is not one song played from start to finish on this whole video. As soon as you start jammin to the first 10 seconds of your favorite song, they cut into it with an interview. Very annoying. If you want to watch and listen to the band crank out some classic metal, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD!"
2,maiden still rules,"hi every one,its me again moran from israeli recently bought the dvd and didnt realy liked itim a fan of maiden for about 11 years now and i already got everything of maidens stuff.the dvd is really empty of content part of a few moments of greatness!!!the whole studio scenes are a total fakedave mustaine is shown on every corner of the dvd (which is a good one)i love maiden so if u do too focus on the rest of their stuffsorry everyoneiron maiden still rocks!!!"
3,Fun to watch,"It's fun to watch a band talk about one of your favorite albums or certain parts of their career. I would've liked to seen more on Paul Di'anno but at least they have him on there singing for about 10 seconds. The ""message from clive burr"" is ultimately a gimmick when u read the chapter list cos all it is is a 30 second spot that says ""clive burr wants you to know he has..."" and shows a slow motion shot of him drumming. He does look a little frail throughtout the dvd. Megadeth's Dave Mustaine is also on this dvd praising Maiden...and a little comical at times explaining how cool they are. Being an American, it took some getting used to listening to about 10 people all with english accents! (especially Dave Murray! don't talk please, just play the guitar-ha ha). A good dvd, could've been better. The Metallica classic album DVD is waaaay better. This one buy only if your a die hard fan or want to relive the glory days... like me!"
4,Pretty Good,Pretty good look at the making of the album. Doesn't tell you about all of the songs but it's still good.
5,This is very good!,"Hello,This is really good. I loved it all. i wish I could meet Colin Powell. He is a good man. Keep up the good work!!"
5,Fantastic Dance History Book,"""No Fixed Points"" is by far the finest dance history book on the market. Ms. Reynolds is brilliant in her observations, thoroughly researched, technically accurate on every point, insightful, succint, and (when necessary) hysterical. Don't let the size intimidate you, it is a page turner, and at times, a true scorcher. Ms. Reynolds literally choreographs the full spectrum of what was 20th century dance: no stone was left unturned. Most remarkable, though, was her ability to just suck you in where you never wanted to leave. The only negative is that the reader can only envision the events, rather than experience then, BUT, through Ms. Reynolds superb ability, the 2nd hand / vicarious experience(s) are amazingly satisfying."
3,The man you love to hate strikes again!,"""Von Stroheim"" (see Wickipedia for his REAL autobiography) plays the quasi-villain in this 1934 cheapie.It is charmingly awful in all ways, including, unfortunately the audio which hasn't been restored. But if you want a chuckle, give it a look. There are moments when you can feel your leg being pulled with V.S.'s over the top Prussian mannerisms, etc.The role of the American as the would-be 'savior' of a young girl's virtue is typical for the time. All in all...a HOOT, and one you can have fun telling your friends you've seen in your ever-growing role as a lover of old, bad movies...LOL."
4,Great starter set,"I've owned this set for over 4 years. Unlike the review below, my set is used daily and has held up very well with absolutely no scratching or any other damage. I always hand wash with a softer sponge. The mugs included are my favorite to have my tea in. This set looks great on display behind my glass cabinet doors."
2,Beautiful design but questionable quality and durability,"When we first got this set, we were both very pleased with the unusual and striking design. We thought we would continue to be pleased for quite some time. However, after minimal use, we discovered that the finish just didn't seem to hold up to everyday use. The finish is so marred now, especially with the dinner and salad plates, that we would be too embarassed to use these dishes for company. Our previous older dishes now look much better than this set. However, we could recommend the coffee mugs as a separate purchase."
5,Pfaltzgraff Sphere 16 Piece Dinnerware Set for 4,"I just received my first set of dishes yesterday and I absolutely love them! I'd read another review where it was mentioned the cups were very large, but I was still surprised at how large they are. They are the perfect hot cocoa mugs! I love how the different pieces compliment each other, but are different-it's not as boring to look at a full place setting. I can't wait to get my next set."
5,Beautiful and durable,"We have been using this set every day for 3-4 years now and still love it. We have 12 settings, and so far nothing has broken. I'm not sure why some reviewers have said the quality is poor--I think these dishes are well made and durable. We haven't had any issues with paint coming off. As for the cutlery markings, perhaps it's true that they scratch a little, but it's hardly noticeable and doesn't bother me. Truth is, I don't think I know any light-colored dishes that won't get slight cutlery marks over time.Many of our friends have complimented us on this set. We also have the salt/pepper shaker set and creamer/sugar bowl, which, like the mugs, are really cool in their design. This set has personality, and depending on the set-up, it can look casual OR elegant on the table.I'm only sorry it has been discontinued, because it will be more difficult to find replacement pieces."
3,Beware of Design!,"I bought these mugs as a gift for someone. They seem to be very sturday mugs and a good size cup. However, I was surprised when I opened them and saw that they had gray graffiti marks all over them. I know, I know...the name of the mug is graffiti, but the picture on www.Amazon.com doesn't clearly show the gray marks. I was surprised...that's all. I can't comment on the quality of the mugs, but I wanted to pass along the information about the design."
3,Could benefit by including example code,"This textbook is fairly comprehensive on the various compression algorithms, and the theory behind them. However, a CD with included sample code and the ""example"" pictures mentioned in the text would have helped tremendously in conveying the material. As it is, the text tries to explain the algorithms using math with no sample code whatsoever."
4,Very good coverage,"The best thing about this book is the coverage and organization of the material. Sayood covers a wide variety of compression topics without getting into the nitty gritty details of them all. Thats why its an ""Introductory"" book. This book is a valuable resource for those who want to know the basics of various compression techniques and can be used as a starting point for further details. Some topics like arithmetic coding are covered in more detail than others. The book is also organized nicely with mathematical foundations provided as and when necessary."
5,A great textbook,"This book has all the ingredients for a great textbook. It provides good theoratical background without going into unnecessary details, gives lot of discussion about applications, provides great exercise problems, and above all it has outstanding examples that makes some of the difficult concepts easy to understand.Data compression needs a lot of background in information theory and other areas specific to speech, image processing etc. It is impossible to give a rigourous theoratical treatment of all of those in one volume. A strong point of this book is that it gives you just enough background on a variety of topics - without making the whole book obscure. In that respect, it is very application and implementation oriented. It is in fact what it says it is: A very good ""INTRODUCTION to Data Compression"""
3,Isn't it about software?,"I bought this book based on the title and the publisher. This is a good book, but it is not an ""Introduction"". For it to be an introduction one would expect that: 1)It had at least one programming example IN the book (not at an ftp site) OR 2)It didn't assume that you were a math major.The author covers a wide (and up to date) set of topics. But I kept getting the feeling that the author was ""exercising his PhD"" at the readers expense."
2,Not nearly good enough,"I bought this book on e-bay for $1.13 and I want a refund. The word ""introduction"" in the title of the book is an understatement. Save yourself a dollar and lots of time by side stepping such encyclopedic treatments. The book lacks any rigor or insight. It is a bunch of hand waving arguments that at best gives a superficial treatment. If you have never heard of lossy vs lossless coding, Huffman vs arithmetic coding, scalar vs vector quantization, transform vs wavelet, etc. and want to have a layman understanding of these topics, this is your book. I feel sorry for students that use this book in any academic course."
3,One of the worst 'Four Last Songs',"I was quite disappointed with this recording. While Karajan is not so bad though his tempo is inconsitent and too emotional, Gundula Janowitz sound so empty and shallow. She is one of the worst sopranos among those who recorded this 'Four Last Songs' and this is one of the most overrated recordings. Janowitz's incapability of expressing the depth and delicacy proves that she has been overrated too thanks to Karajan's favour of her.I recommend you to listen to Lisa della Casa's 'Four Last Songs' (Decca Legendary Series)."
5,One of the greatest solo vocal recordings of the century.,"I find it hard to imagine a greater performance of any work than Janowitz and Karajan in the Four Last Songs. Her voice, instrumental and flute-like posesses a unique quality perfect for Strauss' idiomatic vocal writing. That music of such richness and emotional depth could come from a man of eighty years is astonishing.The coupling of Metamorphosen, also written in his final years following the end of WW II, and his youthful Death and Tranfiguration is poetic, making this a ""desert island disc"" for everyone."
5,Deeply moving,"This was the first version of the ""Four Last Songs"" I ever heard, and it's still one of my favorites. Despite outstanding renditions by Renée Fleming, Jessye Norman and others old and new, this one still garners special affection. Janowitz just sounds ravishing in this recording, with a magnificently sustained, slightly dark tone that suits these pieces perfectly. The orchestral sound is vivid yet never overpowers Janowitz, whose voice soars effortlessly, thrillingly.The accompanying tone poems are equally gorgeous. ""Death and Transfiguration"" rises to a sublime, cathartic climax, with some of the most beautiful string playing you'll ever hear - until you hear ""Metamorphosen,"" which glows like an autumn fire. The entire CD shows off the silken tone and precision of the Berlin Philharmonic when these superb musicians and von Karajan were in their prime, making spectacular music together. Of their many recordings, surely this is one of the finest."
5,An emotional volcano!,"I think that everyone who loves the soundworld of Wagner,Mahler and of course Strauss should have this disc.This disc is 78 minutes of a volcano that errupts emotional melodies one after the other.Very impressive(not only this disc but all the recordings of Richard Strauss with Herbert von Karajan.)For me Herbert is one of the all time great conductors.Not always Mr.Nice Guy but all his recordings are done with a commitment that I barely hear with other conductors."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"Gundula Janowitz did an amazing job on the Four Last Songs by Strauss. Her tone is so beautiful with clarity, and her voice is so expressive. She also does not over sing these delicate songs which I heard oversung, and it ruins each piece. Of course, Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic are amazing and perfect for Richard Strauss. The violin solo in the ""third"" of the four last songs is amazing and heartbreaking. You dont even have to be a Strauss fan to love this cd. Anybody who loves music has to love Strauss's Four Last Songs which can be described as some of the most beautiful music written."
1,4 of these reviews were written by a representative of the company,"It is so transparent, the reviews were not written by normal people, this supplement is no different than any other garlic supplement that you can get for about 10-12 dollars cheaper...special aging processs....LOL HOw do you age wine or cheese?YOU just let it sit!!!!! DOnt be suckered in...honestly the only ones enthusiastic about this product are the owners or distributers of ths product. It may work well but so does any other garlic supplement on the market.PAY 10 dollars or 24 dollars. thats the only KEY diference."
3,Stretches the belief but well written,"The story is pretty unbelievable,even for this genre, but the author's writing talent is the redeemable feature of this novel. The reason why this woman is chosen, kidnapped and artificially inseminated with the hero's child is pretty weird. I don't want to give a spoiler, but how the kidnappers choose to ruin the hero is a spaced-out, hit and miss plan on their part.The pace is, thankfully, fast and reaches the necessary crescendo at the finish. The perpetrator is obvious, but this does not detract from the ending.An okay read, which is enhanced by tight writing and good imagery.***"
3,Expected a bit more,"I read the reviews for this book and thought I'd give it a whirl. It's not intrinsically bad or poorly written, it's simply unrealistic and at times, a bit silly. **SPOILER ALERT** I'm not ruining too much of the plot here but to be perfectly honest, this next sentence will divulge one fairly interesting plot twist.Jessie is a cop. However, how she EVER graduated from the police academy is beyond me. She is scared most of the time (I expect our heroes and heroines in blue to be fearless)and doesn't quite know how to investigate - anything. OK, so why did I like this book even a little, you may ask. Frankly, I was curious as to the ""who"" and ""why"" the heroine is inseminated. And the sex was pretty hot. So if you're looking for something to pass a few hours w/ try this one out. Just hope you don't get someone like Jessie when you call 911."
3,"Interesting anti-romantic Pathetique, harsh Waldstein","Kempff's solidly classical approach makes his Pathetique an interesting alternative to the more romantic interpretations that form the main-stream. However, in the Waldstein and Apassionata his sound is so harsh in the fortes (probably partly due to the recording) that no modern student of the piano would want to imitate him. The lyric quality of the Waldstein second theme is entirely lost."

1,Horrible recording,"When Kempff was told that he played Beethoven like a human being rather than a pianist, he took it as a complement. Well, in case you want a pianist's Beethoven, then look elsewhere. Kempff's interpretations are dead and dry. Can you imagine the passionate Beethoven sitting at a piano and playing these sonatas like Kempff does. I cannot. To me Beethoven is energy and passion, which this recording is missing."
5,Presents the classic 8th century poem by Shantideva,Guide To The Bodhisattva's Way Of Life: A Buddhist Poem For Today presents the classic 8th century poem by Shantideva in a thoroughly reader accessible and elegantly translated English text which was transcribed under the guidance of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. The poem itself offers wisdom in the art of balancing altruism with personal happiness and self-satisfaction. Shantideva's Guide To The Bodhisattva's Way Of Life is a core recommendation for dedicated Buddhist Studies collections and reading lists.
5,Big Time Rush #3,"I purchased the series on the weekly run show, for my granddaughter. She loves BTR and enjoys the show very much, and Amazon gives us the opportunity to watch it again and again. We don't have DVR or TIVO so this is a really great alternative!!Thank you Amazon."
3,Tricks for the Spot Filter,"I find that the Spot filter works the best only when shooting items that are located on the ground. If the sun is about 180 degrees away from ur subject, it will give a good blur. However, if your subject is 90 degrees away from the sun (for example, picturing a flower on a tree straight in front of you), you will be able to see the actual ring of the filter on your picture...not attractive."
3,Okay.,"My cat loves this toy - there are plenty of feather and strips of metallic ribbon in a nice plump tail. However, the wand itself is so thin that it has bent just from holding it. This would be a really lovely toy if the handle was more substantial, but, as it is, I don't expect it to last much longer before it breaks."
1,Not at all what I expected.,"These are flimsy and short and were shipped in an enormous carton. Not only is the product a disappointment, but the company should be ashamed for using a 4800 square inch carton with tons of plastic inside to ship 2 tiny, short cat toys that should have been shipped in a tube or a padded envelope. Shameful and a disappointment."
5,OUR CATS LOVE THIS TOY!!,Our cats love this toy to play with me. They get a bit of exercise jumping for it and have been quite good about getting it away from me. One will even drag it around the house and then return it to me for more play. Recommended by four cats! * * * *
1,Wrong book,"Someone, I do not know if it was amazon or the friends of the library id the book as written by Colleen McCullough and it was not the case, it's another book alltogether...."
4,what you see is what you get,"typical salt shakers with a cute, ergonomical shape. my only complaint is that the stoppers are plastic and awkward for refilling."
1,Is that Liszt's great Sonata?,"No words! Just a simple, superfast read of Liszt's masterpiece, no soul, no ritardandos, nothing. Only supersonic playing, full of virtuosity and bravura in ""virtuoso parts"", mere exercise in others. That is what people call ""cirkus Liszt""! Horrible!"
5,"A must, if you are interested in China","What a great story and all the while you learn something about Chinese history. I finished the book very quickly, because I wanted to know how it ended."
3,"spa,a different female experience","Sweetly written about the benefits of Spa experiences. Treating oneself to selflove and relaxation so well needed today. Based on spiritual values, the book is informative especially for young ladies-and old- ageless actually!Reader in Sweden.23/5 2009"
2,Definitely not for the novice or grammatical sticklers!,"Aside from the numerous spelling errors, even the ""concise"" explanations after the question/answer portions of this book are pale. This book is for people who have at least an intermediate level of knowledge of Oracle to get anything from this book or at times to decipher some of the explanations that make absolutely no sense at all. The official Oracle DBA certification exam guides and practice tests are the way to go for your certification!"
4,A great book,"This is one of my favorite books for 3rd edition GURPS (which is the only edition I play). It presents the rules for shapeshifting in a simple to understand fashion and finally brings together all of the different ways of doing it from previous books.If nothing elst, the werewolf flip-book pictures in GURPS shapeshifters is entertaining."
4,Overall pleased,"I was happy that Pfaltzgraff made a matching mixing bowl set for this pattern, however I wish there was one more larger mixing bowl for big recipes. I find I often need a different bowl around the holidays for larger recipes. This set is good for everyday mixing / cooking."
4,Great Intro to Zen,Before I bought this book I knew nothing about zen. As soon as I received the book in the mail I began flipping through the pages and I could not put this book down.This book is an excellent guide for simplifying your life. By introducing a little bit of zen into your stressful life- you could definitely make your life a little bit more bearable.
2,"Unfortunently, there are no negarive stars available for rating","I just witnessed this travesty of drama and have spent the last hour mulling over how poor it was and wondering what I can possibly do to get those three hours of my life back. Poor writing, flat characters, lack luster plot, complete lack of the farce it attempts to have, are all hallmarks of this work. Never mind that this wretchedness is foisted upon the audience for at least twice as long as it should have been. It was not the actors in any way, but the play itself which was beyond poor. There isn't enough space in this review to accurately and faithfully list what is bad about this play, and leaving a single period to list any merits it may have is too long."
4,Summer of Fear (1978),"Entertaining telechiller from Wes Craven starring Linda Blair. Blair plays Rachel, whose cousin Julia (Lee Purcell) comes to live with her and her family at the farm, but macabre events begin to happen and Rachel soon suspects that Julia is practicing witchcraft and voodoo. I wasn't expecting much out of this thriller but in my opinion, it worked very well and was surprisingly scary. Blair does a good job as Rachel and we are with her every step of the way, and Purcell is great as Julia. Wes Craven gives the film a slick, hard look and an impressive atmosphere (this was Craven's first 35mm film), and the script by Glenn M. Benest and Max Keller is riveting and suspenseful. Lois Duncan's acclaimed novel gets a nice little fright of a treatment with this little TV gem."
4,hasnt lost its touch,considering this is a 70d flick its still quite creepy and the sound and video quality of the dvd is great. One wonders why Linda Blair ever dissapeared from the screen. she is always so good to watch and such a natural actress
3,Gives witches a bad name.,"I'd have given it 2 1/2 stars if i could.A demon mama shows up at Linda Blair's house,seduces her family and friends with magic and it's up to poor Linda to fix it.The performances were good ,good enough that i found myself yelling stuff like ""she stole her bf and you think that it's ok that they still live in the same room, mom???"" at the tv.It could've been better if the witchcraft savvy professor had been given more screen time.He was a fairly interesting and underutilized character.Dumbest thing about the movie was all the witchcraft themed stuff.Wicca aren't evil and they aren't like vampires who can't be seen in photographs.This movie is worth renting but not buying."
1,Summer of Melodrama,"I recently rented this movie, expecting great things. I'm usually a fan of Wes Craven, although his truly great films are few and far between. I couldn't believe how horrilbly cheesy this film was!! Linda Blair is very annoying in this film, from her grating voice, to her 1970's afro. I know that it is a 1970's TV movie, but that's no exuse. Salem's Lot was from that same era, and it had some decent scares to it."
2,Made-For-TV Wes Craven,"For those renting this because it's a Wes Craven film, be forewarned - it may be a Wes Craven film, but it's made for TV (and 1970s TV at that), so it has none of the Wes Craven trademarks. ive years after The Exorcist, Hollywood (in this case television) was still trying to capitalize (and unsuccessfully) on a post-Exorcist Linda Blair. Older and pudgier, she certainly had done nothing in the intervening years to hone her acting skills. Not really worth the time."
1,Bad Seller liwenyan,"Friend bought these for me for a housewarming gift from the seller liwenyan and the dishes came broken, the seller didn't pack correctly and now she won't return any of our emails or phone calls to arrange for return of the item. This will mean that we have to go through amazon to get a refund, and she says she is leaving the country!!!!"
1,Amateur Effort,"I pulled this book up by mistake looking for another one and read a few pages. The reviews on this site were obviously written by the author's friends. This was written by someone who doesn't understand the fundamentals of writing. Her characters are flat and uninteresting and do not make you care about them. Nearly every sentence is destroyed by an over-abundance of adjectives. The story is choppy with poor transitions, and the author cannot seem to make up her mind if she's interested in teaching her belief system or telling a story. I would suggest she get some old books by Taylor Caldwell, such as ""Great Lion of God"" or ""Dear and Glorious Physician"" to research how a novel of this genre is handled by a great novelist."
5,Loved it!!,"As a white woman, I really apreciated this book. It is a great way for white people to dive into the arena of racial reconciliation.I also loved that it is written by a man and a woman, that doesn't happen very often."
3,A Good Beginning,Harris & Schaupp provide a decent introduction to race relations and multiculturalism in Being White.
1,"Literally a boring, boring book","The book is extremely boring.It's just about the younger life experiences of the authors coupled with texts from the Bible.1.) Why did they have to relate the experiences to Bible texts so many times for?2.) Like I said before, it's about the experiences of the authors when they were younger and hence those years are not relevant to our years now.Bad, bad book."
4,THE SOMMER KNOWS,"Remember the delectably sexy Elke Sommer? SHOT IN THE DARK, THE PRIZE, DEADLIER THAN THE MALE? All hit movies of the sixties. And she makes an appearance as the sinister housekeeper in this dubbed movie from Germany. Once you get past watching the mouths (the dubbing is awful), you may enjoy the slashfest that occurs. The movie has some original twists that I didn't see coming, including the ending which is reminiscent of the beginning. Fiendishly campy with some strange humor, and some big plot holes, FLASHBACK was penned by Jimmy Sangster who gave us some of those delightful Hammer films of the seventies. The scenery is beautiful, including the house in which the movie was filmed. The acting is about par for this kind of film, and it is relentlessly gory. But slasher fans, particularly of the Euroslash will enjoy."
5,Great Product,"The Painless wiring kit is very well made, although I wish it had a few additional features like a ground post as part of the fuse block. The screws that came with the unit needed to be replaced due to my install location with longer screws. There was plenty of wire associated with the kit. The wires exit the bottom of the block in a tight angle, making a 90 degree bend. I added some reinforcement to protect the wires at this point. It might have been easier to wire without the wire already attached to the block, but it can be done...all the excess wire is in the way as you are trying to route things around parts under the dash. As an after thought I should have purchased the water-proof version and mounted it in the engine bay...it might have been easier. Location under a 66 Mustang dash is prety tight...so finding a place that was out of the way and accessable is hard."
5,Real info,This book gives the real info that I needed to understand Chinese massage. Excellent and understandable. Plus the in depth self massage and massage for others chapters are highly usable information. I'm grateful for this book.
2,Information spread too thin,"Jwing-ming Yang is certainly a knowledgeable person, but his books are too padded with historical and cultural information (as oppposed to practical information) and make too many cross references (to know more about this aspect, read my other book etc...). I can't therefore recommend them highly."
3,McLintock Book Review,"I purchased the book as a Christmas present and received the book promptly. The book was described as being in ""very good"" condition but that was stretching it a bit as there was a grainy substance all over the cover and the pages weren't just tinged yellow, they were REALLY yellow. However, my son, who I purchased the book for, understood this was a used book and was happy with it, so all's well that ends well."
2,Poor Emphasis on Expression,"I was disappointed in this CD. I love Terfel's rich baritone voice, but on these songs, I was forever turning the volume up and down -- he either sang a few words or lines WAY too softly and then BOOMED out a few words or phrases. I had my finger busily readjusting the volume constantly! Too bad, nice songs, poor delivery for listening to on a CD. I should return it because I'm certainly not going to play it again..."
2,Bryn Terfel - Something Wonderful (Bryn Terfel sings Rodgers & Hammerstein),"Bryn Terfel - Something Wonderful (Bryn Terfel sings Rodgers & Hammerstein)is a recording where Brian Terfel tries to sing Rodgers & Hammerstein and the end result is just ok. The booklet contains not only all the lyrics, music notes but also photographs of the Terfel at the time of the recording. The problem is that it just does not work that well. His voice does not working with this kind of music. It sounds strange. Not recommended. 2/5."
2,Terfel Is Not Broadway,"Bryn Terfel has a marvelous voice ... for operatic and similar venues (Porgy & Bess, but not Showboat or Oklahoma or South Pacific). The accent and inflection are wrong, and the arrangements on this particular album are only fair.Think of Luciano singing ""There is Nothing Like a Dame"" or Jose ""Get Me to the Church on Time."" Uh, uh.Be careful, by the way. ""Something Wonderful"" is about 80% the same as ""Some Enchanted Evening,"" and neither is very good."
1,"I love the songs and the voice , but not this cd.",I love the songs of Rogers and Hammerstein. I love Terfel's voice. But the audio is very poor. Did I just get a bad disc?Terfel's voice is too faint.
1,A new meaning of throat singing.,"I cannot believe that the critics of today can rave about such an inferior singer as Byrn Terfel. He sings so badly, I can't believe he has had the career he's had. I don't care how many roles he's sung, he hasn't any vocal technique at all. If anyone would care to hear great singing, buy the; ""Thomas L. Thomas"" Voice of Firestone video and listen to a great Welsh singer. This is a great artist and vocal technician. Try; ""John Charles Thomas,"" ""Lawrence Tibbett,"" or ""Nelson Eddy."" Bryn Terfel couldn't carry their music cases!"
5,Feelings of the Heart!,"Officer Brynn is one of Pleasant Valley's finest. She findsher heart and values turning as she comes to know a strangerthat has just moved to town. Rand Benedict, a lawyer on asecret mission,has bought River Walk. River Walk is a mostbeautiful house on a piece of land near the river.

Hard workersthat love each other and their land. Rand soon finds hissecret mission will not work and finds a way of life heenjoys plus the love of Brynn.Another great book. I enjoyed it...you will too."
5,An overall beautiful lamp.,"I bought this lamp for my dorm room for this fall. The lamp has a perfect glow through the crystals that form diamond shaped shadows on the walls. Don't forget to buy a candelabra bulb and not a regular one, or else it's not going to fit!"
5,great lamp,I bought this lamp for my bedside table. It is wonderful!!It gives off the perfect glow and looks fantastic. I would recomend it to anyone.
1,Should be called the Longest Whine,"The book premise is a good one, and I was really excited to read it. It started out whiny and blaming others, but I figured she was trying to portray her thoughts as a teenager, so I kept reading. I kept waiting for her to grow up and stop blaming everyone else and stop having a pitty party, but she never did. In the end, I just didn't want to hear her whine about how one more person had hurt her, or how she couldn't sleep again because she was so overcome with grief. This was the longest pitty party, the longest whine, and the Longest Road, that she somehow never got off of. I hope this isn't a true reflection of her life, because, while it is clear she grew up in a very dysfunctional family, she really needs to take some ownership too. Until she does, she'll just continue to be a whiny pathetic person that no one wants to be around."
4,A Good Little Movie,Check this movie out. It is a Comedy/Love Story set on a Kibutz in war torn Isreal.
1,5 POUNDS SHIPPING?!,"eforcity sent me the wrong and defective items before - there is no way this item could weigh 4 lbs and have a shipping weight of 5lbs... that is how they make money on 89 cent ""products"". I had to use the Amazon guarantee to be reimbursed from the last time eforcity sent me garbage. THANK YOU AMAZON, YOU ROCK!"
1,Very Disappointing Doesn't Work - Don't Buy It.,"BargainCell Rapid Travel Charger for iPodThese were cheap (90c) and although there were some mixed reviews I decided to buy three - for me and my children. One was dead on arrival (DOA). When either of the others were plugged into my iPod Touch it started doing strange things - turned on even if powered down and I couldn't turn it off even with the hard on/off button, the touch control didn't work and the screen display randomly zoomed in and out and sideways. The chargers also created loud interference with radios in our house. I'm concerned that if I continue to use them they may damage my iPod. With shipping and handling they actually cost $11.64 for three, but it would have been easier, less hassle and safer to just take my money and throw it in the bin."
1,I feel mislead!!!,"After waiting for over a week to get this, I find out it's for an iPod that's not even made any more! I guess you get what you pay for .. not worth shipping to send it back but I am still disappointed! My ""bargain of the century"" turned out to be a burn!"
1,JUNK,"This item does not even work, The battery icon on my Ipod just blinked like something bad was happening to it. Don't buy"
1,SUCKS AND DOESNT WORK,"THIS ITEM DOESNT WORK. I PLUG IT IN AND THE LIGHT GOES ON - I ATTACH THE IPOD AND IT DOESNT GET CHARGED....I EVEN LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN OVER NIGHT AND NOTHING.....DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. IF SOMETHING SEEMS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PRBABLY IS. SHAME ON AMAZN FOR CONTINUING TO CARRY IT"
1,Stay away from Importer 520 / Bargaincell,"I have ordered products from Bargaincell/Importer520. The original didn't work and they sent a replacement that failed. They then would do nothing because the ""original order"" was over 6 weeks old. Amazing. I guess that's how they ""get you"" ... on a technicality or worst ... they have a stock of bad products that only last a few WEEKS and when the first fails, they send another dud. I highly recommend not ordering ANYTHING from SF Planet."
3,NOT for Touch!!! Great otherwise.,"Great for older iPod models, but does NOT charge my iPod touch!!! Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend with the latest iPod video model. Works great for him, but my ulterior motive was to have a charger that I can use at his place for my iPod Touch... FAIL!! Other than the Touch compatability issue, it's a great little charger. I have one that looks almost exactly the same, but does charge my touch, so don't know how to help folks tell the difference on that one."
5,iPod charger,"it works great and was shipped quickly, I paid a penny for it so i really couldn't complain anyway."
1,Afraid to use it.,"I received this item from a third party seller. It is so cheap looking I am afraid to plug it into my IPod. It looks like it would just feed 120V power directly into the IPod. It may work just fine, but I threw it away. Lesson learned, do not buy something where the S&H is 3 times the cost of the item."
1,bargain charger,"I ordered this charger for my i touch, because it sais it is copatible with it, but it doesn't work, it sais it is not compatible and doesnt charge. The main problem is I leave overseas ans theres nothing I can do.Check this products before offering them for the itouch."
1,Stay away from this one!!!,"This product is garbage. First one I received was defective and did not charge my 3G Ipod, but instead like some other people have said, drained my battery to the point my ipod would not even turn on. Second one I received as a replacement did the same exact thing. Lesson learned for me so next potential buyer beware."
1,I should give the thing zero stars!,"Well the charger arrived here (via usps >:0) on August 22, 2006, so I test it out for the first time. I plugged the thing into the wall and it burned out! There was a big bright orange spark and that was the end!"
1,So you think you found a bargain?,"True it is a partial bargain. But honestly don't waste your money on this, it's a piece of crap. Though it does charge the ipod it takes roughly 12 hours for my 60gig video to get 3/4 full battery. Just buy the one from apple."
1,Do NOT save on your charger!!!,"I had one of these because I was too cheap. :( It toasted my iPod on the first charge. If you are lucky, you may get one that works. If not..."
4,Apple Ipod charger,"What can I say, for the money it is a good charger. I like the fact that it has a light on the wall wart so you know if you have power."
1,Not what I expected.,"The product doesn't work as well as I expected.It charges my 5th gen iPod ([...]), but not my iPod touch 2nd gen ([...]).Overall not too bad for the cost, and it charges my iPod. But since I wanted it to charge my ipod touch, the use I can give to it is limited.Returning the item is not an option I would consider given the shipping is substantially more than what the item cost.Bottom line: I would recommend for iPod classic, not iPod Touch or iPhone."
1,Piece of junk,the thing i got was not what was pictured. it doesnt sit in the socket well.spend a few dollars and get something that's not garbage
1,Poor quality and DANGEROUS,"This product was great at first, it worked despite the bad reviews I had read and was worth the money. After a few weeks, the charger started making a clicking sound as it was charging, and the red light on it would blink, all at random intervals. I didn't think much of it at first, then it stopped working all together. Being an electronically minded fellow, I opened it up, only to discover that a wire attached from the circuit board to the outlet prong was disconnected. Thus, the clicking sound was 120V AC 60Hz arcing across inside the charger. This thing is not worth the danger or risk of not working. In the long run, a more expensive style will be much better."
1,Got what I paid for.,"I took a chance on this charger because the price was so low, and I lost. It didn't charge my 3G iPod. Instead, it seems to have drained the battery. I've already thrown the charger away."
5,Great Product,This product does exactly what it says. It comes in handy and keeps me from having to borrow my daughter's.
5,Apple Ipod Home/Travel Charger,"Great Product, would be lost without it. Much easier than charging via the computer USB port."
5,love this item,This really works great it charges our Ipods fast and now we can charge them anywhere!
1,Expect service,This tral charger does not fit the Ipod I have and it was advertised that it did. Very disappointing because I now own two and and I can not use them.
1,Bull s,"I bought these for use in my vacations. It worked OK a few times, but one day it stop working."
1,What the .................................,This order was the wrong one and the shipper had it advertised as an adapter for a 3rd generation and it is for a Nano. One thing I can say that when I did order it took forever to receive it from the seller. How about over a month. I do regret I even placed the order. It also takes forever for the seller to respond if you send them an email.
2,Why buy this? Better options are out there.,"Why would anyone get this type of charger? For about $40, you can get an ""isupercharger"" that you can plug into the wall, plug into a car lighter, plug into a USB port, or run off of a 9 volt battery. With the 9 volt battery option, you can use your iPod all you want, even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping. It's a small, all-in-one design. I don't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when I take my iPod along."
3,"Frances, Plenty, Tender Mercies",Great Performances (Frances / Plenty / Tender Mercies)Tender Mercies and Frances were fine...Plenty had French dialogue and the English subtitles were also in French???? Somebody must have pushed the wrong button during the copying...we were forced to dump Plenty in the trash as it was unusable.
3,A Lady's Guide to Rakes,"This was an interesting plot. The heroine doesn't trust the ""Rake"" but he ends up being truly reformed. They both end up being worthy of each other."
2,...,"Meredith was not necessarily mean, but she was immature. I never understood her decisions or or why she said the things she thought. She was a bit conceited, and dramatic. She was always upset and irritated at something or someone. The sex scenes were not even tepid. She almost deserved to be with Chilton because they were both so uptight. If you're looking for a good Kathryn Caskie book, this isn't it. But it killed time."
2,Will this show be released UNCUT?,"Are there plans for this show to be released ""UNCUT""?I would really like to collect some of the Episodes in certainVolumes."
4,"Fun Toy, needs some tweaking, though","Well, my kids love to make their own monsters, and I love playing with them, too. The only problem that I have is that the velcro used to attach all the parts is not a strong hold, especially for the arms. They are usually half falling off, and non of the parts are very secure. But, that aside, it is hours of imaginative play for me and my kids, and that's more important!!"
2,The pieces fall dawn all the time,"This would have been a great toy if the pieces that are attached by Velcro wouldn't fall down ALL THE TIME.Any attempt to make this puppet move would result in it losing an arm, or an eye, or the nose........you get the idea.I thought the point of a puppet is to make it move to interact with the child but there's no way of doing that with this toy without getting extremely frustrated."
4,Cute,"I got this for my 3 year old son. It's cute. Sheds a bit, and the velcro will eventually stop working... so consider this before you purchase it. I got it on sale for 60% off, so I'm happy with it. had I paid a lot, I may have been disappointed."
4,Nice...with a BUTT!!,"I do love this and my CLIENTS love this as well. BUTT....I do wish there were two so I guess I just need to buy another one. Great for imaginary play and working on those ""GHOSTS in the closet""!"
3,"Great Concept, Decent Product","My creative and goofy 5 year old niece was very excited about this puppet, but played with it minimally. The parts are cute and ""sesame street"" like, but tend to fall off because the monster hair gets stuck in the Velcro. She seems to prefer paper puppet kits where you can permanently glue the parts on, but if you were really good at voices you might be able to add some ""life"" to this toy."
5,Made a great Christmas present!,"My 2.5 yr old nephew loved this! He is a huge fan of Mr Potato-head, and this is basically the Muppet equivalent. His eyes lit up when we pulled it out of the box, definitely recommend for kids who love puppets, Muppets, and stuffed animals."
5,Silly creative quality toy,Fun toy! Probably better for kids with sibling...think Mr Potato head only softer. My 2 year old is a bit young for it.
5,My nephew LOVED his monster puppet,I ordered this a month ago and my nephew absolutely loves it. He is 3 years old and plays with this constantly. He even sleeps with it. He hasn't managed to destroy it or lose the parts. I am going to buy more of these as gifts for others in my family.
4,Fun Stuff,"This monster puppet rocks! My kids love making crazy faces! The only thing that wasnt so great was how easy my kids lost the smaller pieces, and how the velcro picks up pet hair. So if you can keep these two things under control then I would definantly recomend it for kids of all ages!"
5,Great puppet!,"I don't know if it is the kids or myself that likes this puppet more. They love it when I use it to ""read"" stories to them. The pieces can go missing easily, but it is SO fun to put together!"
4,Puppet,The parts stick together a lot. Now theyre just a big velcrowed mess at the bottom of the bag. But when its all taken apart and put together right it can be fun. Durable over-all.
3,cute idea,"I liked the idea of this and the monster pieces are cute and colorful, but the velcro is not a good thing. It catches on the furry pieces at the wrong spots and doesn't hold the pieces on when you want it to. So arms and stuff are always falling off during the performance. My son got a little frustrated and hasn't played with it since!"
5,Fun Toy!!,"I bought this for my 4 year old nephew. He loved making the monster, chasing people with it, then busting it apart to start all over again. We had so much fun with this. It was constructed well and I feel will be able to keep up with one energetic little guy!"
3,Just OK,Fun toy for about 20 min. Lots of different pieces to make different monsters. Glad I didnt buy 2 like other reviews had suggested.
1,disappointed,"I should have believed the others' reviews -- the velcro really is terrible!! The ""fur"" gets stuck between the velcro grooves and prevents it from sticking to the puppet. I usually love melissa & doug products, but they really failed at this attempt..."
4,A Gem,"In the short time I've owned this book, it has become an important part of my library. When I began reading it, I didn't want to put it down.The author starts by sharing an experience he had as a Navy Chaplain (which I won't spoil here :) ). From that experience, he draws important points about prayer that are woven throughout the book. He also shares a number of other real-life experiences and scriptures that illustrate how prayer can open the door to God's miracles in our lives.The author takes a compassionate and common-sense approach. He's not preachy or self-righteous. He offers practical insights and suggestions that I found very helpful.Maybe you've never prayed in your life but want to start. Maybe you pray regularly and want to make your prayers more meaningful. Whether you're at one end or the other or somewhere in between, this book will inspire, teach, and encourage you."
5,The best Perfume ever!,"Everytime I wear it someone compliments me. I love it and now that they have discontinued it, it is even harder to find. Grab them while you can."
5,Pfaltzgraff Heritage Sugar & Creamer set,"I love Pfaltzgraff. The pieces are very durable. It's wonderful that they are so versital, also (freezer, oven, fridge, dishwasher safe). The Heritage collection is a simple, yet elegant pattern that goes with any kitchen and/or dining room setting. The sugar and creamer completes the dinnerware set. I have enjoyed bringing them out for my guests and for use everyday."
1,not worth it,i was really excited to receive this product but it really hurt my allergies. everyone is different and some people will surely love this product. it shipped really fast and the seller was execellent but this product just wasnt for me. lucky for me the scent fades fast .
3,Eh. Smells generic and has no staying power.,"Of all the Burberry perfumes I've tried, this is my least favorite. It smells kind of cheap and lasts about ten minutes."
3,can't take the wind,Good roomy tent. Relatively easy to setup. Can't take much wind. Better for light weather camping.
2,Not for pleasure reading!,"I am a devoted fan of country decorating but this book is REALLY tough reading! It was written in the 1980's and perhaps it is the difference in time now but there is almost nothing in this book to recommend it to a reader. The pictures are bland and the writing meanders. Unless you are willing to spend time just wondering through the pages, I could not recommend this book, not even just to look at the pictures."
4,good book but not in very good shape like advertisesd,The book is a good one and if you are going to Ireland you should get the book. When I recived it it was old looking and definetly was a older book but I am satisfided with my purchase.
3,Fiercest Scarecrow in the World,"The little scarecrow boy wants badly to go out into the fields and scare the crows, but he's too young and inexperienced and not fierce enough. His father says, ""Wait till you grow,"" but the boy is impatient to try out the six terrible faces that he is taught. Once he learns them, he decides to run away so that he can try out his new skills, but the crow is not afraid as he uses each face in succession, becoming more out of breath as he continues to run after each attempt. Finally, with the sixth and fiercest face - success! His father arrives just in time to proudly see him scare the crow away and the scarecrow boy becomes the fiercest scarecrow in the world.The close up illustrations of the scarecrow boy's face when he's scaring seem disproportionately large (similar in magnitude to the smiling face on the cover), although it allows the reader to better distinguish between the six degrees of scary faces."
4,great!,I just read this book to my first grade class and they loved it. It's a great book to introduce the idea of never giving up and feeling proud after a job well done.
4,The Faces We Make,"Margaret Wise Brown has, through this book, shared with parents how to accept and assist children wanting to take risks and explore life. This is also a wonderful book to use as a way of explaining adult jobs to children. It is a way of aleviating children's fear of separating from parents when they go off to school. The author has shared her humor, creativity and I suspect her experiences. This picture book is also considered a predictable book, because there is one verse that is repeated. Enjoy this delightful lighthearted story and see if you can relate to it or to other books that you have read."
4,Sweet and funny,"The little scarecrow boy is told over and over he is too little to scare the crows but proves that he can. I think there is a good lesson for children about trying your best. However, the boy sneaks out without his parents’ permission, and nearly fails. I would not want my children to think that sneaking out to prove a point over something I have already forbidden would be alright. While reading this story be ready for those types of questions."
1,"If you like kids reading the ""F"" word, this is the book for you!","I bought this for my son b/c it was like 4 or 5 stars. My son LOVES Harry Mazer books...didn't know this one had the ""F"" word, ""N"" word, etc...He was only into it like 10 pages and said, ""Mom, I don't think this book is good...it has lots of swear words in it.""We decided this isn't the book for us.The scholastic books by Mazer are more child appropriate."
4,Good book for kids.,It was an OK read as an adult but it's clearly a young readers book. The story is interesting.
5,great book,My 12 year really enjoyed reading this for a school book report. Some history some fiction made it more enjoyable.
5,Everybody should read it,"The Last Mission is a great book. Its based on a young jewish-american soldier who sneaks in the army at 16 and hoping he dosn't get caught everyday of his time in service with exciting acounts of action,The Boy who sneeked on to base is jack he also acts 18 by meeting a girl, also he dosn't let his family know where he is going. , Meeting friends four years older then him and they don't know how old he his, he his thrown in a German POW camp were the heart stopping action continues. Its so exciting you'll want to read it again. Harry Mazer writes a great book"
5,The Last Mission,"The story I read was called The Last Mission. This book is mainly about a boy named Jack Raab. He sneaks his way into the Air Corps to go to Germany to fight in the war. Jack Raab is fifteen years old and he has a really good friend named Chuckie who is also in the war with him. I really enjoyed this book because it had a lot of action in it and I really like books that are exciting with a lot of cliffhangers at the end of the chapters. I really recommend this book to anybody because even if you're not into war books, you will still find it very interesting to read."
5,WITHOUT A DOUGHT THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THE auther kept me so interested i read the whole book in about a week. And thats hard when your in school, with homework and stuff. I FIST READ IT IN SIXTH GRADE FOR FUN. I LOVED IT, AND I RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS. THEY LOVED IT. sO THIS YEAR WE HAD TO DO A BOOK REPORT AND I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH I DID A REPORT ON IT.it`s as good as the first time."
3,The Last Mission,"In the story, The Last Mission, there are six interesting events. When Jack Raab joins the Army, he is only 15. He had to use his brother's birth certificate to apply, or else he couldn't have got in.. Jack goes through training for the Air Corps doing combat missions in New York. Jack goes on his first mission for the Air Corps doing a bombing mission over Germany. During one of the missions the plane gets shot and crashes over allied territory, then the crew gets taken back to the United States. On another mission the plane gets shot and Jack has to bail out, and he gets caught by Nazis. After he gets caught, he gets sent to a concentration camp. American troops finally find Jack and take him back to the United States. These are six of the many exciting events that take place in this story."
3,Good story but language may not be suitable for young reader,"This is a good story which is well told. It is fairly realistic, although there are several technical errors in the story (which would be spotted only by USAAF veterans and enthusiasts).One word of caution: this book is promoted for young adults and youth, but there was a surprising amount of profanity in the text. Realistic, but perhaps not suitable for young readers. I bought the book intending to give it to my son, but decided against it after discovering the bad language."
1,NOT For Children! F-Bomb and foul language abound!,"As many other reviewers have noted, but I will chime in as well (in hopes of warning others,) this book is not for children! I'd say at least 14 and up, and be warned that the F-word and others are used liberally throughout. Granted, it is in context (""The swearing in the army was like nothing he'd ever heard before,"") But then it's quickly condoned: ""...At first it made Jack uncomfortable, and then he started swearing like everyone else."" Oh great: Just what my 10-year-old needs to read... NOT! My son was as happy to return this book unread as I was."
2,Concerned parent,I purchased this book for my 11 year-old son based on the reviews and information printed here. My son loved the book and then passed it on to his grandfather to read. I was horrified to find out through my father that there is extremely foul languqage in this book. Perhaps you need a rating scale to include this information for parents.
1,Dead Give-away,The title was a give away you knew what was going to happen. I wish when he was a POW and that last couple of chapters could have lasted longer
2,Bad Language not suitable for kids,I picked this book in hopes for a story about his life in POW camp. Not a book about ariel gunning. The language was suitable for a person on road rage not for a 10 year old girl. Even though soldiers probley talk like that it's not a childrens novel. If you don't mind vulgar language it's ok. But if you hate curse words don't even pick it up!
5,Outstanding Book!,"I never thought that I was going to read an intense war book with such a good and meaningful ending. ""The Last Mission"" is a story of a fifteen-year-old boy who lies about his age to get into the airforce during World War Two. He wants to be a hero, but when he is put to the test during the war, he regrets his decision greatly.The book is filled with intense action scenes with good details to really make you feel like your right there with the characters. Throughout the book, you wonder how the author could make such a tradgic book have a good ending. The truth is that the ending isn't such a happy one, but more of one with a great lesson to it.I would definatley suggest this book to higher aged teens due to language and certain scenes in the book. I can almost guarantee that anybody that reads this book will get something great out of it!"
3,Great book but Kindle edition doesn't include cover art!,"I'm trying to ""kindle"" my children's love of reading. It would have been nice to include the exciting cover art in the kindle edition. It's lame that Laurel-Leaf, ""an imprint of Random House Children's Books,"" couldn't manage that. It has boring generic cover.I'll raise my rating from 3 to 5 stars when my kindle edition gets updated with the proper cover art.My advice is when considering the kindle edition: always try the sample first. If the sample doesn't have proper cover art, don't buy it.The story is great! Excellent historical fiction."
1,Very foul language! Not for kids.,"So disappointed. After reading several positive reviews for this book, I purchased it for my son. Did not realize it would have so much foul language. Wish there had been some kind of warning. I did not expect a kids book to have F-bombs."
1,Overpriced...,The book is good. But what's with this rip-off price? You can kiss-my-rear for $20.00 cash. 1 minutes worth of work.Have a nice day.
2,"Tries, but rarely explodes like it wants to","2 1/2Not without attempts to invigorate hardcore with more melodic assaults and occasional off-genre experimentation, Origo still ends up sounding more or less like so much of the same by almost always reaching back into the base of generic riffs, fragmenting whatever creative momentum they have going into smaller, less significant bursts."
4,A Tonic for Your Ears,"If you have not encountered Webern's music before, then I would suggest that you start with Boulez Conducts Webern II. But if you have already purchased that disk, or encountered Webern via another route, then you might want to give this disk a listen. What can make this disk a tough one for the first-time listener is what Webern does with voices--it is one thing to hear brass or strings jumping around from note to note, but to hear the human voice do so can be a bit of a shock. But if you can get past that initial shock and listen to these pieces a few times, you might begin to find them quite bracing and refreshing, a real tonic for your ears. Boulez is an old hand at conducting this kind of stuff, and the DG ""4D"" sound is quite good. No, I am not recommending this CD to everyone, but for the musically adventurous, I am recommending it in light of the caveats I outlined above."
3,A little too dark for me,"I rented this film based on the strength of the cast but I wish I'd researched it a bit first. Loosely based on a true story, Burke & Hare is about two men who commit increasingly heinous murders and sell the corpses to a school of anatomy (circa 1828).I can handle some dark comedies if I find myself empathizing with the characters on some level (as with the premise of Horrible Bosses), but I didn't find Messrs. Burke and Hare to be very sympathetic at all.I must admit I didn't watch the entire movie. I decided to cut my losses and quickly skim through the remainder of the film after an extended sequence where B&H; are trying to zero in on the perfect way to kill their victims (after several mishaps and unusable corpses).If you're into dark comedies I would imagine this film rates a 4/5 at least - it is well done otherwise. For me personally it rates a 2/5, so I'll split the difference and call it a 3."
4,hamper,"hamper came brand new in origanal package and was delivered within days of the order. It didn't have great assembly instructions, but was pretty easy to put together. My daughter loves it, and with the price, as long as it last me another two years, it is worth it!!"
3,"Garth ""I Thank Yo!"" Rockett","Made in UK in 2000, Serial# PUR-324, Playing Time 68:28The album's full title is ""Good Evening: I'm Ian Gillan And These Are The Moonshiners"", and was recorded back in May 1989 while Ian Gillan was temporarily ""out"" of DEEP PURPLE.Rarely do we get the chance to hear recordings of IG's solo material in concert: this disc presents us with songs that were recorded on a wide spectrum of albums, including the GILLAN/GLOVER collaboration. The musicians here (Steve Morris and Harry Shaw on guitars, Mark Buckle on keys, Keith Mulholland on bass and Lou Rosenthal on drums), typically not featured the original recordings, perform very well.The recording quality is good and intimate, and the songs are played without ""stretching"" or endless soloing.An interesting performance, but for Gillan fans only!"
1,Broke within 2 hours,"Save your money, both mine broke within the first night. I was stringing beads and then tried to add them to yarn. They both broke."
3,Wire broke,One wire broke right away. I have never had that happen before. The second one has worked ok so far.
3,Ear jams,"meets expectations. Nothing great, but it seems to assist in keeping the buds in your ears and with noise reduction."
2,clunky,I got this because the original earphones hurt my ear. Using this definitely helped but it is still a little uncomfortable. There are some pointy edges on the earjam that still pricks the ear while in use. I bought myself a Sony Fontopia ear bud and am extremely happy with it.
1,Dont Buy If you Know Bass Treble,"This is good for those guys who dont care about Bass, Treble , High Freq , Low Freq . I bought it and dont recommend for those who care about the music . Its good for its Mechanics ( fits good and doesnt fall even in the Gym ) but as far as the clarity fo the music its a No NO ..."
3,"Okay, not very durable","Ok, these are definitely a huge improvement over the one that comes with the ipod. I like a lot of bass so i liked these, but they really seem to make good bass by muffling the upper and mid range, and raising the volume. As for durability, which really isn't so important on such a cheap product, mine started losing little plastic pieces and snapped in half when i dropped it. Also, the little seals are very easy to lose, as they sometimes come off the unit if it isn't in its case. If you want more bass then what comes with an ipod, get them, try them, like them, break them."
1,"Good idea, bad execution",The size and weight increase is significant. The snap tabs tend to rub against the ears.
1,EJAM is junk,This product is utterly useless and will NOT fit onto the apple ear buds. The inner diameter of this product is too big. I had to trash it.
4,Get it if earbuds don't work for you,"My husband's ears are shaped in a way that regular earbuds just fall out. We've solved that problem for regular music listening with the er6i's which jam into his ears (and has great quality, sound isolation, etc), but he still has some earbuds that he needs to use.... for example, the set that came with his cell phone, and a motorcycle intercom that we bought. He just pops these on the buds, and is able to use them without any problem.He's not too concerned about the sound quality in this case, but rather the adaptor quality.The negatives. Sometimes they pop off the earbud when we're storing them (note, we've never used them with iPod earbuds, just the two mentioned above). Sometimes the grey part alone pops off, and that's all too easy to lose. I can't use them at all. My ears just aren't big enough, the result being that the back of the earphone pushes against my ear - really uncomfortable!Anyway, my husband is happy with them."
3,"Great idea, bad solution","Good idea to solve the problem of the quality of the apple headphones, but not a good solution, because increase to much the size of the earphones and does not fit in to the ears."
3,Do not fit iPhone 4 headphones,"I read the specs on this product, and know that it's advertised specifically for iPhone headphones. Based on the images I *assumed* that those would be the same size as iPhone 4 headphones. They are not. The iPhone 4 headphones are ever so slightly smaller, and these adapters don't lock on. So, just a word of warning if that's what you're looking for. --- I hope Griffin will come out with an updated size soon."
4,Worth the money!,"I bout these back in 2007 for my 1st iPhone. ""Normal"" earbuds hurt my ears and they always fall out when I do almost anything... especially run. So I bought these and have been very happy.I am a clutz so every so often I would drop my iphone and the earphones would get ripped out of my ears and hit the ground. The ear pads would often fall off... so I ended up super gluing them on t the ear piece. No problems any more.Fast forward to 2010... I upgraded to the new iPhone 4 and sure enough... the same crappy earbuds come with it... so I went back online looking for these jewels to add to those (Since I super glued the other ones on to the OLD pair).One day I will pay for a NICE pair but for now.. these work fine!"
2,this product does NOT fit iPod *touch* 3G,"The description says ""iPod 3G and 4G"" and they mean exactly that. These do NOT fit the ear buds which come with the iPod *touch* 3G."
1,Very disappointed!!!!!,I just received the EarJams in the mail and I am very disappointed. I purchased these to cover my iPhone headphones and they do not fit at all!!!! The description says they are for iPhone headphones and I don't know what iPhone headphones they are for. I have the standard headphones that came with my phone and the EarJams are too big and fall off. I am very disappointed that I spent $18.00 with S&H for these pieces of junk!!!
1,Ear bud attachments,"The description said they would fit I-Pod headphones, however they are to big and fall off of the I-Pod shuffle earbuds. I am very dissapointed."
1,Not compatible with ipod nano,"These are not compatible with the new ipod nano earbuds (ie. with the volume control built into the headphones). They are oversized and do not ""click"" on at all. Not even going to bother returning, just threw them out."
3,Earjams are not a replacement for Ear Buds,"For those of you who are quick on the ""1-click"" like I am, be aware that that these are snap-ons for your current pair of iPod Ear Buds. I bought them thinking that they came with as a replacement. That's definitely my fault and not the manufacturers, but it is disappointing when they arrive and you find that you still need to buy a replacement for your broken Ear Buds.After snapping them on to a working pair, I found that they do increase the bass and volume. However, this appears to be at the cost of the other frequencies. I tried several EQ settings on the iPod to find one that provided some high frequency treble, but it's definitely not as good as a full range of sound. I'm also not impressed with the design since you could easily lose one of the snap-ons in the bottom of your backpack. Hence, the cool carrying case?All in all, not bad for $15, but still disappointing."
4,"Pretty good, especially for the price","I didn't have a problem with the bass boost that others mentioned - these actually sound pretty good with my iPod Mini, even at loud levels during a workout. I did have a problem with the sizing - even the smallest buds still don't fit well into my ears, but these still fit a lot better than the earbud headphones the iPod comes with. For the price, definitely worth it."
1,One of the worst products I ever bought,"These attachments for your earbuds make the sound all muddy, not good at all. Upon trying them, instantly I was grossed out by the sound. Totally not worth buying. Also, they look strange. You are much better off buying better headphones or just using the stock headphones as is rather than trying to buy these. Trust me, they are just a gimmick and actually hurt the sound rather than help."
1,Just don't fit!,"I don't understand how anyone can get these to stay in their ears - unless they have massive ears! The size of the rubber attachment is irrelevant since it doesn't get anywhere near to going right into your ear. It is blocked by the main earjam connector and the earbud itself, both of which are way too big to go in most poeple's ears.Great idea, but poor design. I wish I had just gone for the ipod in-ear headphones as they do appear to be a lot smaller."
1,Griffin Ear Jam Earbuds for iPod,To put it simply; this is the worst invention and the most worthless iPod accessory yet! they donot help the sound IN ANY WAY and they don't stay in your any better at all!!THEY DO NOT DO WHAT THEY SAY THATS WHY THEY ARE SO CHEAP
3,Not Earphones,"I misunderstood what these were exactly, and thought that they were earphones, but really they are just clips to go over standard issue apple headphones. This could have been made clearer in the description."
2,Not comfortable,"The whole idea seems good, but the earjams just don't fit well in my ears (even with the smallest ones in). In fact, they even start to hurt after a while and they leave my ears sore. They are not worth the money at all.They do give more of a closed-sound atmosphere, but they aren't worth the pain and the hassle."
2,Not too impressed,"I feel duped by this product. After reading through so many product details I must have misread this one. The product is actually only a cover that fits over a pair of ear bud headphones. The headphones pictured are not included with the purchase, and I found nothing that such a fact. They work OK but tend to become uncomfortable after several minutes. I haven't tried to move around while wearing them, but they don't feel like they are stable enough to stay in place while doing so. I paid less than $6 including S & H, so I can't say I didn't get my money's worth. Just be sure you know what you are getting with this product. COVERS ONLY!!! There are three sizes of ear pieces so maybe there is a size that will fit you better than me."
1,only because zero is not an option,"useless piece of ****go with a quality in-ear headphones from sony, etc.. this really won't give you the effect you are looking for. in fact, it deteriorated the audio output from the headphones that came with my mp3 player(Cowon iAudio X5L. one of the best out of there)"
2,Watch out! These won't fit on all iPod earbuds.,I believe that this is an older product that only fits on the older Apple earbuds. Griffin Technologies now sells a new product with TWO sizes of snap-ons. I should have investigated before purchasing.
2,"Comfortable, but that's all...","I was having a lot of discomfort with my iPod ear buds, and thought these would be the ticket. They ARE more comfortable, but the promises of improved sound quality are totally false. I found the sound level to be substantially reduced, especially at higher frequencies.At least the carrying case is usable for my earbuds - so it wasn't a total waste of $$$."
2,Noise and unfortunately sound quality reduced as well.,"Good noise reduction for air travel and treadmill, but overall sound quality is also reduced. They are difficult to keep seated in the ear canal when jogging since the earbud now extends out against the lobe.OK for temporary use when needed for noise blocking. They snap on and off easily and work well on the 2nd Gen Ipod Shuffle, which still uses old style earbuds."
1,Not compatible w/2nd gen Nanos,"Bought these to enhance the uncomfortable earphones on my wife's new 2nd generation Nano...problem is they don't snap on - they're too big, and once opened, cannot be returned. No info suggests they're not compatible, but they weren't in our situtation."
1,"Horrible, Painful Product","These Ear Buds are large and hard. They have sharp edges and hurt my ears. I have large ears and large ear canals and wear other earbud type headphones all the time which do not bother me. These were not only painful but did not enhance the sound, but actually reduced it. This product should be taken off the market."
2,Maybe They Will Work For You,"The idea is great, they sound okay, but they just wouldn't stay in my ears!"
3,Not as happy as I'd hoped,"The material the covers is made from is actually super-thin, and doesn't make that great a seal, at least for my ears. The sizes do give you a fair shot at finding one that fits."
5,Earjamz rule! Too bad they don't make them anymore,"The sound from my stocker iPod headset is dramatically improved using this product. The other huge advantage over integrated in ear models is the there is a small relief for air pressure. If there is a little moisture in your ear the other brands can seal off, creating a sound vacuum that muffles the audio. These never have that problem."
3,Doesn't fit iPhone earbuds,"Item was just as described. I bought these hoping they would fit my iPhone earbuds, but they are much too large. I can't speak for the last gen, but the newest (iPhone 4) earbuds are quite a bit smaller, and so these don't even come close to staying on. Do not buy if you are wanting to use with the newest iPhone's earbuds!"
2,You Get What You Pay For.,"Everybody knows that the white headphones that come with the Apple iPod not only deliver inferior sound quality, but they don't fit some ears comfortably. This add-on provides a solution for one of these problems. The Griffin EarJam Earbud Sound Enhancing Covers, when snapped onto the iPod headphones, fit snugly into the ears, and there are 3 different sizes of earpads for maximum comfort. But the sound quality is a different matter. While the bass is definitely more aggressive, the clarity is lost, and the sound is frankly muffled and a bit distorted. This may not matter to casual listeners who don't care about these nuances, but I found it unacceptable and unlistenable. For the low price these buds ask for, you'd be foolish to think you'll get premium sound quality. They do little more than improve the fit of the iPod headphones. If you're looking for anything else, spend a little extra cash on another pair of headphones that offer better sound."
3,"Good sound, ok feel","I purchased these for my wife and me. She has since left them by the wayside because she couldn't get them to stay in her ears. I on the other hand have enjoyed the sound. They block out the majority of surrounding sound and add a deep base tone, which I like. Unfortunatly they tend to irritate my ears after long listening sessions. Great sound, ok feel on the short term."
3,Earbuds,"These are comfy on the ears. I can't say that I really noticed a big difference in the volume/sound, but they are a lot more comfortable than just the normal earphones."
2,Not good if you have small ears,"These fit okay in my husband's ears, but he says they are fairly uncomfortable. I have small ears and I cant even get the smallest fitting to fit in my ear. Great concept, but really needs some help before it is effective. Bottom line, don't buy these if you have small ears...just invest in some different headphones."
4,Great for the $,I love these earbud covers.....they rarely fall out while running/walking. I am sure you can find better ones for more $....but I am very satisfied with my purchase.
1,EarJams don't work for me,"I bought these hoping they would make my earbuds work better and less painfully, but they do not improve the Earbuds staying in my ears. My ear canal is not right for these I guess. They did seem to bring up the sound a little, however."
5,thinking this is a rip off?,"Ok so i have to admit i was a bit leary about making this prchase. i thought there was no way that this item was going to help the way that the ipod headphones sounded. and more importantly i thought i should buy another set of headphones, but i read a little bit about them online and took a chance. And now i have all my friends going out and buying them too. They make the headphones sound worlds better and they fit more comfortably in my ears. PLUS it comes with a pretty cool case to hold the headphones in when you are not using them, which keeps them from getting tangles up when they are in my bag.I would go so far as to say that if you have an ipod- you MUST invest in these!!"
2,save your money for better headphones,"The Earjams work exactly as described in the featured review, and are, I suppose, worth the $11 I spent on them. But I'd strongly recommend that you use the money towards Apple's in-ear phones. The Earjams increase bass at the cost of everyting but volume. All the nuances and detail of of my music are diminished, and that's not very pleasant There's just more bang for your buck buying better buds. For 3 times the cost of earjams you can get Apple's earbuds and 10 times the sound quality of the earjams. If you only have $10 to spend, get the Earjams. But if you only have $10 to spend, how the heck did you get your hands on an iPod??I do use my jams every now and then, notably biking on city streets - they up the volume without silencing car horns and attack dogs. But for quality listening, they're unacceptable."
2,THESE DO NOT FIT ALL IPODS!!!!!,I have a 4GB ipod nano that I got for Christmas and this doesn't fit them.
3,"If comfort is a bigger priority than sound quality, these may be for you","I tried these because bud-type earphones have NEVER fit my ears. The smallest rubber earpads that came with these actually fit in both of my ears, and will stay in for a workout. I have not experienced a problem with the rubber pads popping off. I like to listen to my iPod when I go to sleep, so I was worried that these would jam into my ear canal when I lay down on them, but they are reasonably comfortable for that as well. Of course, the sound quality is poorer with these. Audiobooks sound fine, but music sounds muffled...it's sort of like being in the bathroom during a keg party...?"
4,Useful and cheap,"I had purchased the Apple in-ear headphones and used them for a couple of months, not always satisfied because they would slip out of my ears while working out. My puppy chewed up the earbuds recently, so I was left with the choice of buying the Apple product again or trying to find something else. The Griffin ear buds are perfect, they snap right on to the standard Apple earbuds, and although they do sacrifice some upper-range sounds, they are a much better option for my wallet! If you're concerned about losing the mid to upper range sounds, don't buy this product. Otherwise, they are fantastic, and at $8 they're a steal compared to the $40 for the Apple product!"
1,Totally worthless,"I bought this item, hoping that I can use them with the First generation IPOD ear phones as described in the product home page. To my dismay I only found out that they don't go well together at all. The ear buds are too small to fit into the covers. I contacted the seller, who claims that I can not return it back. I went back to product description page to take a look at the technical details and there it clearly says this ""Compatibility: iPod nano (1G and 2G), iPod mini, 3G iPod, 4G iPod with click wheel, iPod Color, iPod Video, iPod shuffle (1G and 2G)""Now, on reading further more on that page, amazon.com's reviews says its not compatible with 1G and 2G iPods, but I am very certain that they don't have this text in their review when I bought my the so called sound enhancing covers."
4,Does the job as advertised,"The Griffin sound enhancers are adjustable to find a comfortable fit, and they allow one to hear the music but at a lower volume. They come with adapters for both the old and new iPod headphones. It was a good purchase."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"THE CLIP MADE IT EASIER TO USE THE IPOD EARPHONES, SINCE THE BUDS ALONE WERE ALWAYS FALLING OUT. THE CLIP MAKE IT BETTER, BUT ARE NOT SNUG IN THE EAR"
1,Get Something Else,"I bought a set of these when I first bought my iPod. They were perfect. Well, a year of using them everyday took a toll on them. So, I decided to buy another set. They most have changed the design of these. The first set I had, snapped in place. But, these didn't. They were lose fitting. My daughter lost one in two days. Get something else unless you find a set before the re-design. Those were pefect."
3,Not for small ears,"I'm sure this is a good product. However, I have small ears. Flat to my head and small ear canals and have a very hard time getting earbuds to fit. I bought these to make my iPod earbuds fit better. Even the smallest size don't fit well. They do not stay in well. I can make them work if I'm sitting still but they fall out if I move much (i.e., not good for commuting which is when I use my iPod). So, while I'm sure they would work for other people, they really aren't a good fit for those of us with very small ears. i'm going to look for ones that are longer that will fit more inside my ear. Hopefully, I won't go deaf."
1,THEY DO NOT FIT iPod earbuds!,"Several people have complained about the same thing. The white plastic covers are too big. They do NOT fit onto the iPod earbuds, rendering them useless. I had ordered this same product twice before without this problem--so I don't know how many of the cases are affected. My family has 2nd gen, 3rd gen and 5th gen iPod nanos. All of the earbuds are the same size, so this is not an issue with the iPod. The problem is with this product.With so many complaints, I have to wonder why they haven't corrected this problem yet?In addition to this, the three different sizes of flexible covers were missing one in one size and had an extra one in another size, rendering the entire product worthless. It isn't worth paying the shipping charge to return."
1,Don't Fit,These do not fit iphone headsets. They are a totally different shape than the earjams I had. They're either defective or made for another headset.
3,Do not get for iphone 3G or 3GS headphones,"These will not fit either headphones for iphone 3G or 3GS....but I thought that I would try anyways based on the price. Not sure if they will fit older ipod headphones.So it's not really fair to give a real rating on this product, so take the three stars with a grain of salt...these may or may not work for ipod headphones. But, I give them a 3 because of the case...the zipper broke on the very first try to unzip...i was going to use the case at least, but now I can't.Oh well..."
1,They don't fit the iPhone headphones,"PLEASE NOTE: That these don't fit any generation iPhone headphones, but do fit iPod headphones. I purchased a set a while back for my original iPhone & they fitted great, but they must have redesigned them & now they're to big. No wonder they discontinued them."
1,A big disappointmernt,"Griffin generally makes very high quality items for the iPod. This is not one of those items. On the plus side, they do stay in my ears much better than the Apple iPod earbuds. That is the ONLY plus side. They sound AWFUL! Volume and bass is indeed increased -- it turns all sounds into a loud, muddy mush. I threw them away after about ten minutes of painful testing. Now that they've dropped the price to practically nothing, that might be a clue about what they're worth. Just go buy a better pair of earbuds and don't waste your money on these."
4,Just fine.,"They transform Apple's earbuds into sounding much fuller, are very comfortable, are thrifty, and have never fallen out of my ears, even when exercising. And I pride myself on the averageness of my ear size."
3,They work perhaps too well,"I was really looking forward to using earbuds to help my iPOD earjams fit more snugly in my ears. However, they work almost too well, because I find that the amplification of the bass makes a kind of shuttering sound in my ears, and I have to turn the volume way down, which I don't necessarily want to do. Sadly, I will probably go back to playing my iPOD without them."
2,"Nice idea, Mediocre results","Griffin Technology usually makes good products, but I have been disappointed by this one.These little attachments for your iPod earphones actually deliver more bass *at the expense of midrange and treble*, producing muffled sound.If you are into bass-heavy music, then these may be worth the money (which is, fortunately, quite little).As for the fit, they are indeed more secure and less likely to pop out, but the clips that hold on to the iPod earphones are ever-present against your ears, and a bit annoying.If you are into classics, jazz or new age, the only solution is to get a decent set of headphones - which usually are not cheap.Sorry, Griffin Tech, thumbs down on this product - nice idea, mediocre results."
4,Not as Bad as People think,"I bought these despite some reviews on here, plus they were only $7.. I took them on a recent trip to Vegas and enjoyed the comfort, sound, and stability in my ear.. (you have multiple ear jam sizes available to get the correct fit) so you won't be shoving them back in your ear ever 5 minutes.."
2,EarJams really JAM your ears,"I bought these Ear Jams thinking that they wouldn't fall out as much as the standard ipod earbuds. I was right, they don't. But they do hurt a bit. They should make them softer somehow. You have to really push them in to make them stay . . . the hard plastic is painful after a while and you may want to take them out. The sound is a lot better than the standard earbuds though, I will say that."
1,Griffin Technology 4039-EJAM EarJam Earbud Sound Enhancing Covers,What a rip off! These are supposed to fit an Ipod Nano and they are too big!! Someone should stop these people from sticking it to their customers. I'm very disappointed in Amazon for even listing this product.
1,Not worth the money.,"I bought the EarJams for a better fitting set of IPOD headphones. They do help the sound, but don't really make them feel comfortable in your ears. They do come with a small pouch to store them that is small enough for a nano, but I don't recommend buying them for that. I suggest to purchase better headphones because these won't help a single bit."
4,ipod ear blasters,i like the new sound coming from my ipod. i can really block out any surrounding noises and concentrate. i use it mostly in the gym. i especially like the the different size rubber ear plugs. only they fall off too easily and i'm already missing one that fit me perfectly.
3,Decent Cheap Add-On for Uncomfortable Earbuds,"These are a nice add-on for the extremely uncomfortable earbuds that come with any ipod. I'm amazed that Apple hasn't offered an earbud upgrade for a small fee. Anyway, these make the earbuds significantly more comfortable and prevent the earbuds from falling out. I hate the apple earbuds because they aren't made to fit those of us who have smaller ear canals. These Griffin earbuds solve that problem. They aren't perfect but they make the apple earbuds usable and they also add volume because they help direct the audio directly into your ear. Not perfect but not bad for the price. They did what they could to improve Apple's inferior buds."
1,Horrible and unlistenable,"If your only goal is to have the awful earbud stay in your ear this will help, if on the other hand you actually want to be able to hear music too, forget it. These are the worst things I've ever owned for music, absolutely renders the earbuds unusable."
4,Case is the best part,"The earbuds I can take or leave, but like others have mentioned, the little zipper case is like it was made for my 3rd generation iPod Nano. Good protection for just 8 bucks. Well, now in March 10 they are [...] plus my daughter left with my fat boy nano. I now have a 5th gen Nano and an ipod Touch. I wanted to comment on some folks saying the earjams do not stay on the ear pad. Mine were loose as well, but I took them off the ear pads and put into the vice on my workbench and squeezed the tabs ever so slightly then heated with my wife's hairdryer. Wait until cool, turn to next tabs and repeat and you'll find that they fit great."
2,"If they fit your ears, probably nice","I'm one of those people for whom the fit of the standard Apple iPod earbuds is not very good. They constantly fall out of my ears. They also let a lot of external sound ""leak"" around them, which means I need to turn up the volume to be able to hear (I mostly listen to podcasts, audiobooks, and other spoken word material).So I was hoping that these would make my iPhone earbuds fit better (because Apple's headset for the iPhone has extra features nothing else seems to provide). No such luck, at least for my ears. These were worse than the standard earbuds.But that's just the shape of my ears, I suppose. I'm going to keep waiting for Shure or whomever to do a real set of iPhone-compatible earphones (not their wretched add-on controller cable, which is not well-designed), and get those, I guess..."
4,Ear Jam Earbuds,Product works as advertised and makes it possible to exercise with apple earbuds for the iPhone without them falling out of my ears constantly. The earjams also do improve the sound quality and bass
1,Does not work for the purpose intended,"If you purchase thses covers to stop them from falling out while you run: STOP! They do not work for that purpose. Also, the bass becomes too acute."
3,Earbuds,"Decent, for the price. Would've preferred headphones already having this type of earpiece, but not at current prices of more than what an iPod currently costs."
5,Great Item!,"These are great. For anyone that has trouble with the earbuds fitting in their ears, this is the solution. They fit great, they're comfortable and the sound is enhanced. I would definitely recommend them!"
1,Does not fit any earphones I can find,"I received my EarJams in the mail today. Only problem was when I opened the package and tried to click them onto my apple earphones that have remote and mic they were too big. So I got out the other set of apple earphones that came with my 3rd generation Ipod touch, still too big. and just too make sure it wasn't a total waste of money I tried a cheap set of earphones from the dollar store and big surprise still too big. Maybe the seller should change the listings of earphones this product is compatible with. Also I thought I got a nice case out of the whole deal but the zippers are so thin as soon as I pulled on them they snapped, at least I can salvage that at some point. I'm not even going to waste my time sending them back"
2,Not entirely as advertised,"The earbud covers seem to work on some earbuds, but they are too big for iPod earbuds."
1,These are rubbish,"I got these for my son for him to use with his new shuffle. What a mistake. The sound quality is horrible. The only useful thing is the case. His shuffle fits inside perfectly, but that is an expensive case. Don't waste your money."
1,for deaf ears only,"this is a terrible product. it effectively eliminates the midrange and most of the treble, leaving only the bass. the resulting sound is horribly muddy, and far inferior to what you get from the iPod earbuds alone. on top of all that, the fit isn't much better than what you get from the iPod earbuds.i bought this product from an amazon marketplace seller for $7 (including shipping and handling), but it isn't worth even that much. it isn't worth anything, in fact. so: save your money and buy a decent pair of earphones that actually fit."
2,Disappointing,"Watery, and did nothing to enhance shine or soften hair. I am seriously not sure what this stuff really is."
2,"Who knows why it's called ""cream rinse""?","This is the strangest conditioner I have ever tried. My son had it at his house, so I used it when I ran out of my own hair care products.First of all, it should not be called a ""cream rinse,"" since there is nothing creamy about the consistency of this product. Because the rinse is so runny, it takes a lot to condition my long hair. It leaves my hair somewhat soft and fairly manageable, but not as much as I prefer. It's definitely green and smells very organic--kind of like crushed herbs, moss or damp leaves. The nettles in the product make my scalp tingle when applied, then itchy once it dries. If the liquid comes in contact with broken skin, it actually burns.Being a woman, I gravitate more toward products with a nice floral, fruity or spicy scent. I suppose guys would like this fragrance, but I don't recommend it for ladies. You'll be much more satisfied with Aubrey's Honeysuckle Rose conditioner."
3,Its okay,"This was my 1st time using an all natural product on my biracial type hair, and while it was okay, i dont think i'll buy it again. My hair wasn't all that moisturized when using this product however when i would straighten my hair then i would see the effects of this conditioner. My hair would be super straight. When i use my hair natural after conditioning with this it was still a bit frizzy and i had to use hair grease so it wouldnt look dry. I would leave this in for 20-30 mins but honestly Dove conditioners do a better job and my hair is way softer."
5,Ultra Moisturizing Product and Wonderful Ingredients,"Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose conditioner has to be the utmost moisturizing conditioner I've owned up to date. I am a Hispanic, late 20's, who was on a path of finding staple products right after I stressed my hair out with severe heat damage. After a year of trying several products on my 3C type hair, it was evident I needed lots of moisture. This product provided that and more. It serves as a great deep treatment, alongside essential oils; it is well for a leave-in because the ingredients are organic and safe to leave onto the hair and scalp; it contains ingredients that are proven to promote hair growth; and dry curly hair drinks this stuff up. It is indeed a STAPLE curly hair girl PRODUCT.If you're interested in additional reviews, visit me on YOUTUBE, under username, ""CCNYCA"""
2,Greasy Product,"I washed and conditioned my hair with this product today. I had to wash my hair twice, I felt as if it was still dirty. My hair is long, and the shampoo made my hair feel tangled, the conditoner made my hair appear greasy at the scalp after I air dried it. It did smooth the ends, and make the split ends look much better. I will try to only condition the ends of my hair and hopefully the scalp wont look greasy."
5,Aubrey Organics Conditioner,"I tried the Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner after reading a lot of glowing reviews about it. I liked the ingredient list and the fact that the ingredients were all natural. The price on Amazon.com was excellent. I purchased it along with another item and got free shipping. You got to love that. The conditioner is very thick which makes it difficult to get out of the container. I'm thinking about adding some oil or water to make it easier to use. I used the conditioner with a plastic cap and heat for 20 minutes. My hair felt moisturized immediately afterwords. But, after rinsing and air drying my hair was as dry as ever. I liked this conditioner and will continue use it. However, it was not my Holy Grail....the hunt continues for the *perfect* deep conditioner. Something that will leave my hair feeling soft and moisturized even after my hair has air dried."
2,Not as moisturizing as other AO conditioners,"I have thick, relaxed, mid-back length hair and I have been thoroughly impressed with all the AO conditioners I have tried so far (honeysuckle rose, rosa mosqueta, and GPB) with the exception of this one. I was so excited to try it, but it just didn't do anything. It didn't seem to penetrate the way the AO conditioners did. It just sat on top of my hair and gave it a waxy feeling. It did nothing to soften my hair and it did nothing to help with detangling. I was just not impressed with this conditioner and will not repurchase. I gave it two stars because of the all natural ingredients..If you are looking to try a AO conditioner, start with honeysuckle rose."
3,would have given it four stars,"This conditioner is excellent as far as smoothing and moisturizing frizzy hair; however, I'm having allergic reaction to it (my scalp and ears feel hot after washing my hair). Am pretty sure the allergic reaction is from the conditioner, not the shampoo (also J.A.Y.). I used the shampoo before with the Blue Green Algae mask by Aubrey and didn't have any problem. Too bad. I would have given it four stars."
2,"Sadly, it didn't meet the hype.","I bought this from a vitamin shoppe and after the reviews I had seen, I expected miracles. But this conditioner really didn't work for me. My hair was left feeling brittle and dried out pretty quickly afterwards. Now it's just another bottle of unused hair product banished to the dark recesses of a bottom bathroom drawer."
5,The Best !,"I believe u should TRY a product before posting a review about it, and AVOID giving 1 star reviews based on the Smell of the product.This conditioner is amazing !It made my hair supple ,incredibly soft and shiny ,it has a thick consistency ,it can be applied smoothly from root to end ,it s extremely noushing yet not heavy or greasy .I have fine hair and this is the best conditioner i ve used so far ..and i ve tried many ... 2thumbs up!"
1,I didn't like the smell,"Unfortunately I didn't like the smell so much that I can't attest for how well it works - I've only been able to use it once. The odor reminds me of the perfume making kit a friend of mine had as a kid where you could make cheap, bad selling perfume with blue or yellow dye. The scent of the conditioner makes me feel slightly nauseous (though a lot of perfumes have that affect on me). I didn't know something natural could smell so artificial. Hopefully the store will take it back!"
3,Disappointed,I swim every day and have found that the chlorine has been damaging my hair. I've found that I have to use a lot of this product for it to have any discernable effect.
3,May be a little heavy for fine hair,"I have fine hair and feel that this rinse is a bit heavy and weighs down my hair. I think this is odd, since it NOT considered a ""conditioner"", but rather a rinse for fine hair. It has really great ingredients for hair, and my hair feels very soft after using this rinse. The green tea is the second ingredient, which means it has a lot of green tea in it, so I think it is a beneficial product. I tend to use it as a deep conditioner on the weekends, and not for daily use, since it is attaches too heavily to my hair."
3,Expected more,"I am an AA woman with 3b/3c/4a hair and while this was conditioning, it wasn't a spectacular product. It also seemed to leave a film in my hair and my hands every time I touched my hair. Maybe I wasn't rinsing well enough."
1,Greasy hair,I really do not like this product because it makes my hair so greasy it looks like I put crisco in my hair.It states that you should shake it - which is really hard to do because it is so thick - it leaves my scalp super greasy & my end dry. Very unhappy about that. It does have a semi-nice smell to it.
2,It's ok but White Camellia is better,White Camellia by the same company is 10 times better for black (4b) type hair.
5,One of my faves,"I love this. It's one of my faves. I use Aubrey Organics conditioner all the time (but not their shampoos, as I just don't like them, and they don't cleanse very well... instead I buy Chagrin Valley shampoo bars online), and this is one of my faves.This conditioner works VERY well at smoothing my naturally curly, frizzy, kinky hair, and the more I let it sit on my hair, the more smooth, soft, and manageable my hair becomes.I can't get enough!I also love the smell. :)"
3,Aubrey Conditioner,A bit of a strong scent - reminds me of the smell when my wife gets her hair colored.But it is truly organic!
4,Decent Product,I like the smell of the allspice. The product works well and knowing that I'm not putting chemicals on my hair and scalp is a good feeling.
4,great treatment for your hair...,"Really great for hair that is damaged/dry and in need to get some moisture and shine...just do not use too much because it can weight your hair down and or get a little oily...I have lots of hair and damaged due to highlights...this produt has a very good amount of rose mosqueta in it...great ingredients, nothing harmfull for your body (who wants to use any harmifull chemicals in your scalp, where there is so much blood flow?)...anyhow, great treatment for your hair...Just gave 4 instead five because it a little in the pricey side...so I cant afford purchasing it as often as I'd like!"
4,Hmmm. . .,"I have a 3c/4a curl pattern that soaks up moisture like a sponge.I am happy to say that after about 2 weeks of using this,I've found my go-to conditioner!This is perfect for those of you who start the day off moisturized and glossy and end the day dry and brittle.With other products,my hair would be well moisturized in the morning,but by the end of the day,it was dry.My scalp gets dry from time to time as well but with this,that's all in the past!My hair and scalp stay moisturized from root to tip all day long!My only reason for giving it 4 stars is the smell.Hate it!!!It smells more like an herb than anything ""flowery"".When I think of flowers,I think of something soft,sweet and feminine.This reminds me more of a weed.But it gets the job done so I still recommend it,just takes a minute to get used to the scent."
5,One of the best conditioners out there!,"I have thick, straight, hip-length hair and I LOVE this conditioner. I'm a product junkie, so I've tried a zillion conditioners, some good, some bad; this conditioner is great for moisturizing dry ends. I wouldn't use it as a leave-in and would be sure to rinse it out well, but it really lives up to the hype. My hair is so shiny and soft after using it!"
5,Awesome!,"I have very fine, thin hair with damage from bleaching it. I am currently growing all the bleached portions out and going all natural for the first time in 22 years. I have never found a shampoo or conditioner that I loved. Nothing ever made my damaged hair look less frizzy or feel soft until I washed my hair with AO Honeysuckle Rose shampoo and conditioned it with this conditioner today. My hair has just finished air drying and I couldnt wait to write the review. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical because it seems there are a few negative reviews and since nothing worked for me before I assumed this wouldnt either. I was wrong! My hair has never felt so soft and smooth. It literally feel like strands of silk, even the damaged ends. there is also no frizz anymore. I will not be caught washing my hair with the toxic chemical shampoos and conditioners I have been using all my life again. I have found my shampoo and conditioner."
3,Great ingredients okay product,"I have natural 4a African American hair. This conditioner did leave my hair soft but not as soft as Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner. It also doesn't have a lot of slippage. The fragrance is OK, overall I feel that this product is overrated."
5,Amazing product!,"This conditioner defined my daughter's 4a curls beautifully. Like the previous poster, I also used this under a coconut oil seal on her hair, and three days later, they are still gorgeous little curls!!"
5,Saved my hair!,"I am a busy college student with bushy 3c/4a curls. Since the bottle is on the smaller side, I stick to using this as a once a week deep conditioner. It is very thick, but you notice water isn't an ingredient so there are no fillers and it actually SINKS into your hair. When I'm at my wit's end and all of my other conditioners aren't moisturizing enough I'll smear this all over and do chores for a few hours with a plastic cap. I'm always amazed that when I take off the cap all of the thick white conditioner has been absorbed into my hair. Seriously a GREAT product, the smell is gentle and natural (I hate overpowering man-made scents) and it leaves my hair LUSH and BEAMING with shine. Staple product forever."
1,Made my hair dry,"This conditioner was thick and had a nice scent, but made my hair dry and brittle after washing it out. I even added a little olive oil for extra moisturizing and it did not make a difference. It also felt heavy while rinsing out of my hair almost as if there was some kind of film left on my hair. Perhaps I used too much (1/4 of the bottle) on my thick hair. I'm too scared to try it again. It took me two weeks to get my hair almost back to normal."
3,five stars if you use it like baby oil!,"I bought this product a few years ago and like another reviewer, it left my hair looking very greasy, as if I hadn't washed it in days! I was ready to throw it but on impulse grabbed it while in the shower and rubbed it some winter dried skin. Worked great, LOL! And the excess rinsed away. So if it's not working out for you as a conditioner then try using it as a skin moisturizer."
3,hair looks oily,"I wanted an organic shampoo because my hair is very dry. I don't process my hair, only blow dry it once a week. I assume it is dry because of the harsh ingredients in those crappy shampoo's such as Pantene and Dove Therapy. So I ordered Aubrey Organics Rosa Mosqueta shampoo & conditioner. The shampoo cleans my hair without stripping it, so its great. The conditioner however,left my hair heavy and oily looking. Tried it on my daughters long thick hair. Rinsed for a loooong time and hers also looked oily and flat/heavy. I don't recommend this conditioner and it doesn't smell very good to me. Also, it is a cream, not a liquid. Most of Aubrey's products have been great but I won't be able to use this conditioner.I gave 3 stars because it is organic and it's good for your hair."
2,I love Aubrey but...,This fragrance is a turn off. It smells like a rose scented perm. It gave me headaches. Smell was too strong. The product did moisturize my hair a lot but the buildup it left in my hair was somewhat greasy.
1,Overpowering scent,"first - this conditioner is a horrible and unappetizing color - and as soon as it comes out of the bottle, the scent is overpowering. No matter how much I rinsed my hair, the scent would cling to my hair all day long and make my eyes water. The only thing that works was to STOP using it! Now I just use diluted apple cider vinegar and that does the trick to get the chlorine out and keep my hair shiny and soft after swimming. It's also organic and much cheaper!"
5,Love it!!!,"I love this conditioner! My hair is relaxed. It moisturizes & conditions my hair and leaves my hair soft and easy to detangle! At first I was weary to purchase this because of some negative reviews--but all I can say is that my hair loves it!!! Remember, what might not work for someone might work for you and vice versa..Listen to your hair. I also love the fact that I can go to Whole Foods or Vitamin Shoppe to pick this up and it's only $10-11 and it's all natural! I would definitely recommend this."
5,The best detangler so far!!,"This conditioner is amazing!!! Needed help with my overly dry relaxed hair which is long and for the first time I can say this is a keeper for me!! A great detangler and conditioner, made combing thru incredibly easy and left my hair so soft and shiny I went ahead and ordered a few more bottles to keep this in stock, simply great!! Highly recommend for anyone struggling with thick, dry and easy to tangle hair!"
3,I had to use a lot of the product for my long hair,"It smells good, but beware if you have long thick hair you will go through the bottle quickly. If it was a little cheaper or came in a bigger bottle it might beworth it....I used it all in a week of hairwashing."
1,"Ordered twice, wrong item received twice","I personally love the Rosa Mosqueta Conditioner. However, I made two attempts at ordering it and received a jar of Sea Soap Shower wash both times. Thus, after returning the second jar and ensuring Amazon customer service was aware of my repeated failed attempts, I gave up."
1,Abysmal,"A waste of money. It left my 4a hair feeling dry, stringy and rough. I tried it twice and regretted it both times. I do know about ingredient changes earlier in the year. But since I had never tried it before, I decided to splurge. What a mistake. Save your money."
1,Disgusting,"The Aubrey Organics conditioner left my hair worse then before i washed it, although it does smell good if you like natural smells it left my hair a greasy mess. It is quite a inconvenience when are getting ready for the day after a shower and blow drying your hair looks like you haven't showered in a week. I will not be using this conditioner in my hair again...hopefully I can find another use for it."
2,Nothing Special,"I bought my Honeysuckle from Whole Foods for $10. Everyone said this was a great conditioner. I tried it and it didn't do anything for my hair. It did not feel stronger, healthier, or softer. My detangling process took the same amount of time. So no, this did not help in that department either. I gave it two stars because the conditioner is all natural, free of harsh chemicals and dyes, and is good for all hair types. It also tamed my frizz also.FYI: I have combo hair. Im transitioning from relaxed to natural so I have chemically straightened hair mixed with 4a natural hair."
1,"Bad product, would not recommend to anyone.","This conditioner is so bad, my hair looked horrible after I used it. First of all it does not do anything what it is supposed to do, I could not even comb my hair after using it. Second of all, my hair looked dirty after I washed it. I am never going to use any product form this brand as it is obvious to me they use lies to advertise their products. If the ratings would allow minus points I would definitely use them now, unfortunately I have to put one star which they don't deserve it as this product did nothing for my hair, it even made it worst ever. My hair never looked so bad, unless I don't wash it for a week or so. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
5,Finally found a great deep conditioner,"African American Natural 4A/B hair. I've been looking for a conditioner that actually penatrates my hair shaft and makes my hair stronger, this does. I follow the deep conditioning directions except, I sit under a hooded dryer for 10 mins (hair in plastic cap). No, this may not be the best detangler. This conditioner does not make my hair super soft like Giovanni Smooth as Silk but, it strenghtens my hair which prevents breakage and that's what I'm looking for. I've compared shed hair pre Aubrey Organics to post Aubrey Organics shed hair, the post hair is notably stronger. I deep condition my hair as stated above, shampoo, and then apply Giovanni Smooth as Silk mixed with Aubrey Organics for 5 mins, to give me that smooth finish. *****Important note, rinse your hair with cold water to close up the hair cuticle."
5,I love the scent!,"This conditioner is great. It leaves my fine (slightly frizzy) hair soft and tame, but not limp and heavy. It smells like fresh nutmeg to me (it's actually allspice), which works for me."
4,HAPPY CUSTOMER,"I purchased the Aubrey's Organic Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner at Good Foods Grocery, and I am very pleased with the results. I am an African American woman with fine, shoulder length hair which I relax it about 3 times per year. My hair tends to be very frizzy, and the conditioner left my hair very soft, more manageable and less frizzy. My hair had become very dry and tangled in the last few months and using this conditioner really made a positive difference.This is the first product I have purchased from Aubrey Organics, and I do plan to try more of them in the future."
1,Formula changed,"Product formula changed in 2012.I have a bottle purchased in 2011 that lists first 3 ingredients as: coconut fatty acid cream base, organic aloe Vera, organic Shea butter.The current (2012) formula's first 3 ingredients are: Aqua, cetyl alcohol, alcohol denat."
2,Waste of money,"I purchased this along with the shampoo from my local health food store. I liked the shampoo for my oily hair, but this rinse sucks. I know it's not supposed to be thick like a normal conditioner, but the consistency of this was hard to work with. It just runs out of your hands before you get it on your hair. I tried pouring it on my ends directly and leaving it on for 3 minutes like I do for any conditioner, but it didn't seem to rinse out well. Felt kinda oily like there was a strange residue left behind, which is strange because it is so water-like. It wouldn't have mattered if it did anything for my hair, but it provided no detangling, no body, no anything. I literally watched the money I paid for it wash down the drain little by little. I could've gotten a bad bottle, but i'm not willing to repurchase to find out if i'm wrong."
4,works good,"I use this as part of my curly hair routine. I love it. Super moisturizing! The only problem is that I find the smell to be overwhelming. It smells very floral, but it's just too strong."
2,Gets old fairly fast,"One of those books taht you hope your kid won't fall in love with, because reading it every night would be annoying. There are better books out there."
1,waste of money,"I am very disappointed in this product. I followed all the ""mfgs. directions"" on how to keep this board in great shape but it didn't matter. the board bowed and cracked after about 2 months (30 days over the Amazon warranty of course....) it's so badly curved we are waiting for it to turn into a sphere."
5,The American System of Criminal Justice,"Book arrived in very good shape as promised. Ad said no markings and good shape and it was, very happy with the book."
4,POLS Text,The Material in the 12th addition is current and very helpful in the study of The American System of Criminal Justice.
4,The American System of Criminal Justice,"It's a required text book for a college course, probably would be better to ask the professor, but the book material is interesting."
3,"Interesting and good, but not great","I read this book in two nights or so, and I thought this book is interesting, but not among the greatest. It must be said that the story is original.You see, in the future the human civilization decays, there are only few cities left and everyone is apathic (regarding this last part - maybe we are in that future). An astronomer finds that an asteroid will hit the Earth and wipe off the civilization. No one would listen to him, so he leaves looking for people to help, accepting with him everyone that likes to come. After some adventures he finds out that the ancestors were very... brilliant. I won't say more, just that the message is optimistic: it only takes one man to make a difference."
3,Not a book of transcriptions,"Be aware that these are *arrangements* by the author rather than transcriptions. Though parts of the arrangements are what appears on the accompanying CD, they veer off into alterations that some may find to be odd musical choices. Why not stick with what's on the CD? It's not a matter of difficulty and it would make it more like the ""Blues Guitar of Rev. Gary Davis"" as the title implies.Another curiosity is the use of a seven lined TAB system to represent six strings (the strings being the spaces rather than the lines as in traditional TAB). It is hard to read for anyone who is used to reading standard TAB. I just read the musical notation and skip the TAB.An OK book, but if you want to accurately re-create the playing of Rev. G. Davis, you're going to need to spend time listening to the CD and making notations in the book --many of them."
2,A loving memory I'd like to forget,"I thought that this book was a disgrace to Tim Horton, his chain of coffee shops, AND to the sport of hockey. I forced myself to turn each page, hoping against hope that this book would get better, but it never did. I lost three hours of my life and precious memory cells. don't make the same mistake I did."
5,Beautiful love story,"This was a beautiful love story, very unique. I don't usually read romance novels because they're all the same: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. Usually the girl is weak and has no personality. Katherine Myers breaks this mold in Ribbons of Silver. The woman, Kenna, is three-dimensional, strong, and very likable. The love story between her and Grey is passionate and realistic. The book had a great plot and wasn't just a background to the romance. I've read all of Katherine Myers' books and enjoyed them, but this was my favorite."
5,The Cambridge French/English Thesaurus,"This book is enormously useful. As a student of French, this book comes in handy when doing French homework, especially French crossword puzzles. If you have done at least a couple of years French study, this is an added bonus."
5,Translations,I am finding the Thesaurus an invaluable help in translations of all kinds - I wish I had ordered it long ago!
4,Good product....,Banana nut is one of my kids favorite Odwalla flavors. Good nutrition and good value buying here instead of in the grocery store.
4,Good for details,"These color-coded films are useful for a variety of crafts projects. I've used them on basswood/balsawood, cured fimo and sculpey clay, and acrylic painted clays and plastics successfully.The sheets are small enough to use in small areas and the variety of grits in one package gives a lot of selection. I've used the roughest one the most, and it can be used to take the splinters off soft wood without a problem. The finest grit is barely rougher than automotive sandpaper. The sheets are thin enough to wrap around a tool to get into tight spaces, which creates a crease in the plastic film that can't be removed. Due to their small size, they do choke up more quickly than a big piece of sandpaper but running them under water does clean the films up."
2,Sandpaper that too easily fell apart,"I used this sandpaper on my model rocket fins made from balsa wood and they did not do to well. Maybe I used them on the wrong item, but i thought it would work..."
3,"Lady Gaga's ""You and I"" song IS this movie","Winona Ryder is AMAZING - still a baby at 13 or so but so beautiful and so talented in this film. She falls in love with a beautiful retard because he's like an animated stuffed animal. She's 13 so of course, she loves the pretty picture in Tiger Beat. She doesn't care that the picture isn't smart and can't write a check or follow a recipe or ANYTHING. This story is AMAZING. I was shocked when it aired on television."
3,"good, but not great","Don't get me wrong, I think STX is a good brand. I bought this head before the season started, and i thought it was okay. This is good for beginners. It is really firm, good for poke-checking, but the side walls are far to separated... so there is a lot of ball rattle. When i was playing in a game i tried to cradle but it just popped out. and the pocket was barely legal. This is a good beginner's stick but not for people who plan to use this for a long time"
5,Let's not forget about Cleveland's Orchestra!,"A musician once said, ""there are no great conductors, only great orchestras."" Since the recording industry has quite forgotten the Bamberg Symphony altogether, we've all been fortunate enough to still be bestowed with marvelous orchestral playing such as Cleveland's on this disc. What color! What richness! What virtuosity! This isn't the emotional trauma of Solti's, or the banality of Ozawa's. This is playing that equals the Chicago perf with Abbado's, the Frankfurt perf with Inbal as well as CBSO's with Rattle. I haven't heard the SanFrancisco disc yet, but if you buy this one first before you hear the work live, you won't be disappointed. Excellent!!!"
4,Suprising,"I have not always been a fan of Boulez' Mahler. For the most part I find him too ""cool."" However, the 7th is probably the most abstract and least emotional of the Mahler works. I am suprised at his tempi in the first movement (somehat slow but not as slow as the lumbering Klemperer.) Yet, overall its a good performance and the Cleveland players perform well. My favorite in this work has always been the first Bernstein recording. He really makes the work sound exciting and the NY Philharmonic plays their hearts out for him. His second recording on DG is good but the New York Philharmonic recording is better."
4,Boulez does a CSI on Mahler,"Mahler's 7th is a tough and perhaps uncrackable nut. Interpreters like Bernstein perform the equivalent of plastic surgery, tart it up emotionally, and makes excuses that Mahler really intended the final movement as a ""parody"" of ""kapellmeistermusik"". Boulez lays the patient etherised on a table and does an autopsy. Diagnosis: this IS kapellmeistermusik!For classical music collectors, having several versions of a work is essential to understanding the piece. Rarely is there a ""definitive"", only-recording-needed version. If you think you ""know"" Mahler's 7th but haven't heard this version, you're kidding yourself. Sonically outstanding, too."
4,"Interesting Interpretation, Decent Playing","Boulez's logical approach to this piece works well, bringing out the clarity of the rhythms and textures. The Cleveland Orchestra also helps out with solid playing, although the sound is sometimes a little thin, especially in the low brass. I prefer the sound of the Chicago Symphony or the New York Philharmonic in that regard. Either way, this performance is a good choice, as are the other Boulez recordings of Mahler symphonies in recent years."
3,Dull Dull Dull,"This is the only Mahler recording I have ever sold to the used CD store. I am a Mahler fanatic and have enjoyed some of Boulez's recordings but this one is just plain lifeless. Check out either of Abbado's recordings for the Seventh. Boulez excels in the First, Ninth and Sixth in my opinion."
4,An interesting and thoughtful book,"Wallace Stegner is known as a ""western"" author, and this book gives insight into why that is true. Stegner covers stories from his own childhood, but spends much of the book on the psychology of both the frontier west and the great plains. What kind of people settled these area, why did they come, and how did that fantastic landscape and climate affect them? If you are a fan of Stegner's writing you won't be disappointed. If you'd like some understanding of the settling of the Great Plains of the U.S. and Canada, you won't find a more readable or insightful work."
5,A good purchase,"I have been looking for this book for quite a long time and was so glad when I found it here. I love shopping on Amazon and your used books have never disappointed me. The book seller gave a good description of the product, had a good price and delivered just as he promised, in a few days. I was very pleased with my purchase."
5,Pot of gold...,"...at the far end of the rainbow. Romantic. Wistful. Mandatory reading for the occidentaphile. Illuminates westward wanderlust, pivotal culture change and the createdness of national boundaries. Stegner's landscape descriptions produce visceral responses."
3,Stegner books,I'm gifting our local library of all of writer'sbooks I can locate.This book arrive in good shape and has been donatedas planned.
3,interesting crochet,"I buy everything by this author and have noticed that she is an excellent crocheter as well as knitter. My first impression of this book was poor but then on looking into the patterns for each bag, I began to see some very innovative designs. I can't use most of the yarns called for (Lion) and also can't felt on my side loading washing machine and this rules out quite a few of the bags. But her techniques are worth exploring perhaps in other projects then the ones in this book. Several use Tunisian crochet. Instead of lining she calls for plastic canvas mesh. She gives instruction for twisted cord on several of the handles. The dancing diamonds felted tote is made with a double-ended hook. Magic miters felted tote is the nicest one (bottom left on front). I also like the pink evening bag on the bottom right. Of all the crocheted bag books this is definitely the most unusual."
2,The very little box of crocheted bags,"The patterns were not as ""fashion forward"" as I would have hoped them to be."
2,I think these boots where returned and resold to me,"I purchase these boots and there was black polish on the boot spacers, no card board insert in one of the boots to keep them from bending but it did have plastic stuff in the top. I think these boots were worn and returned. Did not understand why they needed to polish the boots before sending them out. I paid 300.00 dollars and I do not want reused boots"
3,Has one fatal flaw,"This product worked great for me the first month or so I had it. Then I picked up a 4GB SD card and found out that this product doesn't support them. Not only that, but inserting a 4GB SD card will crash Windows Explorer. I gave product 3 stars since it still reads my handful of 1 and 2GB cards just fine."
1,Doesn't work on Mac or with High Capacity Cards,"I used this product with my iMac. I tried my 2GB Kingston card, a 4GB SDHC card and a 8GB MicroSD card and none of them worked! I am bumbed! This looks good, but just isn't for the modern user with large capacity cards and a mac."
4,Not quite all in one...,"This product does just fine for what it does.... however I would Iike to see support for the SDHC card added ASAP. As SDHC cards become more popular and cheap, more folks will go for them... especially for cameras with RAW support capability and gadgets that store video...I already have 3 such cards and had to immediately purchase a new product to support them."
1,Does not work with high capacity SD cards,I've had this for quite a while and it worked great until I plugged in my 4GB SD card. It doesn't support that. Now I need to buy another reader.
5,Wonderful interpretation of these songs,"It's too bad that so few people have been introduced to the art of Fritz Wunderlich, because he was one of the best singers of Lieder I've ever heard, including Fischer-Dieskau. He interprets each song in a uniquely appropriate way, adding a totally new dimension to each one.Most of us have heard this song cycle before, but if you haven't heard Wunderlich do it, you should buy this CD anyway."
5,Eine furchtlose Müllerin,"In Herr Wunderlich's rendition, when our hero declares in ""Ungeduld"", ""Dein is mein Hertz!"" one can easily imagine his shirt buttons popping off in macho indignation. Other tenors often sound rushed or just grumpy. The singer is known to take some liberties with tempo that might raise purists' eyebrows, but his clear bell-like timbre is a joy to hear. Ah, Fritz, we hardly knew ya!For comparison, W. Holzmair has a very lyrical and sensitive interpretation of Müllerin, and G. Souzay is terrific as well, so I recommend that listeners buy them all."
4,very pleased,this is jamie lee curtis's lost horror movie. its good with a few tense scenes and about 2 scares no gore but some violence it pays a lot of references to alfred hitchcock. the movie didnt disapoint me at all all though it seems like a slasher its a lot more than that id say if u like a movie with a joy ride/hitchcock references and a good plot and excellent directing plus jamie lee curtis in her one horror movie a lot of people dont know about than get it its worth it
3,I've watched it countless times,"The first time I watched this film, I found it fairly suspenseful. And now I consider it one of the more entertaining films I've seen. It was the 2nd or 3rd time I'd watched it that I began to really appreciate it. It has many elements that tie up in different parts of the movie that one would definitely miss the first time viewing if one isn't paying attention to details. Through the course of the trucker's trip across Australia, he's consistently amongst other travellers he started out with, so though there are only a few characters you'll think of as being the whole movie (the bulk of the dialogue is from 3 characters), there are, in fact, more characters that are throughout the whole movie, and quite hilarious at times.This all said, the filmmaker COULD have done a better job at appealing to the masses by making the hilarious little tidbits blatantly obvious so everybody notices them the first time around."
1,This Movie Was Weird!,"Being a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and really liking her first horror movie Halloween and liking Stacy Keach from his Mike Hammer TV show I watched Road Games and I did not like the movie, it was weird, the plot was, well there wasn't much of a plot and it wasted the talents of both Jamie Lee Curtis and Stacy Keach. It was definitely one of the worst movies I have ever watched!"
5,Regarding the Borgo Pio,"Having just returned from Rome, I fell across this title online.The book is FABULOUS. The history is wonderful (wish I had read the book before our trip). We wandered down this street and ate lunch in a trattoria there after visiting St. Peters. The drawings are exceptional. Regarding the Borgo Pio will be a coffee table book in our home.Will go back to Rome, with this book in hand, and spend hours walking the area. So much more there than nice little restaurants!After hitting the ""highlights - must do"" things in Rome, there are so many other ways to spend days there."
4,Regarding Borgo Pio Book,Book presented interesting overview of unique street in Rome in which we plan to spend a week exploring and on which we have secured lodging
1,Don't waste your money,Your better off sticking a piece of packing tape to a filter than buying this filter. This filter is very cheaply made and the one I received was covered in small specks. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,"Nothing intriguing about ""Wedding Captives""","I usually enjoy the Harlequin Intrigue series, however ""Wedding Captives"" was pedestrian at best. One dimensional characters, corny lines (the male lead snarles ""c'mon make my day"" to another character) the romance between the two main characters was erratic at times. They just were hot & cold without having any real chemistry, the writing did not make me care for any of the characters nor could make the plot interesting. This one was quick ""discard"" for me."
5,Squeeze me,I have carried a sqeeze coin purse for many years and worn out several.This was a very nice one and I gave it as a gift and my friend was delighted.
5,Thye American Dream,This book makes us see how far we come from God by following the things of the world. It makes you look at your own life and start making some changes.
3,Nice Radio... C Crane Version Available,"The Kaito 2100 is a good sounding, sensitive, selective AM FM and shortwave radio. It DOES NOT have a BFO for reception of ""Ham"" SSB and CW signals. I believe that it is no longer being imported to the US under the Kaito brand, but only as the C.Crane Shortwave. Unless you are a radio collector and *must* have the Kaito version, save your bucks and get the C.Crane.C Crane C CSW Clock Radio with Snooze Alarm"
2,FM reception,"I primarily bought this unit as a domestic & international travel radio, mostly for local FM in this country. 2 biggies right out of the box. The first is reception, I live in a rural area with good strong signals for both public radio and others. This radio had trouble getting them both in terms of signal strength and clarity- a great deal of backround hissing. Adding external antenas did not improve things. I got better FM on an old analog portable. The second issue was equally distressing, at low volume with a strong and clear FM signal there was a rumble or distortion that no degree of fine tuning could improve. Look at Tivoli Audio."
1,Boring...Like watching grass grow,This is the type of book you could put down and return back to it a week or two later and pick up from where you left off and not care. The book had no life or story line to hold my attention for any length of time. The two main characters are not very interesting and the plot was very weak. Don't waste your time or money. I was given the book as a gift for Christmas and if it wasn't inscribed on the front cover I would give it away.
2,Confusing,"This is a story about two friends, Brady and J.W., who enjoy fishing and end up trying to find two missing persons. I just read the latest Brady Coyne novel and liked it but this book which is written by two authors was difficult to read. The characters take turns narrating every other chapter which would be fine but the timeline was not sequential and ended up confusing me. The two main characters were very similar and I found myself stopping to think ""which character am I reading?"". It was so slow that I was glad to get to the end of the book and didn't really care what had happened to the two women."
4,"Two good authors, double the fun.","I really enjoyed the challenge of reading ""First Light."" Once you get into the rhythm of alternating chapters by the 2 writers I think the story really developed a good flow. Having never read the Brady Coyne series, and having read all of the CW Jackson ones, I now am attempting to find the Brady Coynes that I've missed out on.I think this novel is refreshing and although I am the type of reader who ALWAYS wants more detail and more character development, I found this book to be enjoyable nonetheless.Enjoy!"
2,"Competently written, but irritating as hell.","God, am I sorry I bought this one in hardback.I won't give away one of the major plot twists, but I will say that if the protagonist's love interest did to me what he does to her, he'd be eating his meals through a tube for some time to come. What are we supposed to think of her choice? That she's an idiot? How am I supposed to feel as a reader, after I've wasted valuable time and good money on this idiot? Like ... an idiot, I guess."
3,A CUTE LITTLE NOVEL,There is very little passion in this book. But then again no all relationships can be fireworks. But Bartolomeo tells a nice little story. I didn't care for all the soap opera stuff but it's worth reading. Also the fact that it cute and small with an original cover makes it appealing. It can be read in a week.
4,Satisfying,"It won't light the world on fire, but Cupid and Diana will satisfy anyone with a taste for the new, lightly comic women's fiction books that have taken the book world by storm of late. (Please don't use that gross term ""Chick-Lit"" in my presence. How condescending can you get?!) Unless, that is, the reader is squeamish about women having more than one sexual partner, in which case, he or she probably won't appreciate Diana's realistic dilemma. However, anyone who's been caught between two people will emphathize, and maybe learn something about relationships, faithfulness, and being true to oneself. The book is worth reading for Diana's letter to Harry alone. The descriptions of clothing are icing on the cake.One question for Ms. Bartolomeo--why is Annette in the book? She serves no purpose. Get thee to an editor!"
3,Could have used a better editor.,"This book was an entertaining, quick read. I chuckled at a few scenes and descriptions. I actually teared up at a few of the poignant descriptions of Diana's sister and grandfather. However, there were sentences that strained so hard to be grammatically correct that I had to reread them--why not just rewrite them to flow better? At least one character, Diana's sister Annette, was so extraneous that her inclusion diminished her relationship to her other sisters. Why include Annette at all? Also, her relationship with her father was so incompletely explored that Diana's reaction to him on several occasions didn't ring true. Why not leave this relationship as background color?"
2,Fluff,"This book was too fluffy and happily-ever-after for me. It had potential, but so much was glossed over. The characters were not really developed and there was no insight into why they did some of the things they did. One part that annoyed me was the part where she became ""free"" from her father and he couldn't hurt her anymore. Aside from some mention of him not liking her gifts, there is so little about their relationship. The ultimate outcome was so predictable it made me laugh. This book was an easy read, but it lacked substance. And those descriptions of the plots in the soap opera were really annoying."
3,"Cute, but oh so predictable","I can relate to a lot of the story, but still it lacked in character development. although I liked Diana, i really didn't care what happened to her. Its good for a quick summer beach read."
4,"I NEVER read ""chick"" books, but...","Let's face it. I'm a guy. My usual literary fare is military SF. On the other hand, I know the author, so I had to pick up a copy of _Cupid_and_Diana_. As it turns out, I was cracking up halfway down the first page. Even if you're not into romances, this one's good - a rich smorgasbord of humor and sensation. It does tend to read a bit more like a long short story than a novel, but the content more than makes up for it. Good job, Chris!"
2,Readable yet without passion,"While this book is a quick read, it was devoid of emotion. I had a hard time getting excited about the characters and found the majority of them self-involved and not that interesting. Although reading the book was not an unpleasant experience, I would not recommend it to a friend."
1,Boring!,"Don't waste your time. You don't even like the main character, which DEFINITELY decreases your chances of liking the book. She will spend an entire paragraph describing the lace on someone's dress. I wish I could say that I finished it, but it was too painfully boring."
1,Painful,"How can such a short book take so long to read? I hate to say that, because the first chapter sucked me in. Just when I thought the plot was going to move along, she starts to get into a bunch of backstory. Okay, fine, we need a little expostion. Then the book turned out to be more whiny backstory than any real plot. The book lacked any real character development and Diana just couldn't stop whining to save her life. To top it all off, the author used Tom Waits in vain. It didn't sound like she was really into Tom Waits, just using crib notes in the hopes that it would make the book sound ""edgy."" It only made her look like a poseur. If this book had a soundtrack, Tom Waits wouldn't fit the bill. Try some Dan Fogelberg next time, Ms. Bartolomeo."
3,A Sweet if Somewhat Vapid Read,"Diana Campanella is in her 30s when she realizes that her shop is floudering, as is her less-than-passionate relationship with her finace Philip. Throughout the course of Cupid and Diana, we are introduced to Diana's love-hate relationship with her large Catholic family, and follow along as her life changes upon meeting Harry Sandburg, a recently separated lawyer who has just moved to D.C. The novel is predictable in all aspects, but an easy read. Bartolomeo makes some interesting observations about life that make the book shine every now and then, but as whole, it's largely forgettable. A comfortable look at a life of a woman who manages to shake the cloak of inertia off of herself, something that, as we all know, is harder and harder to do as the years pass."
3,should have been longer,"I too knew the author in that Catholic high school, and many of the scenarios and characteristics she attributes to her characters come straight from real life. I enjoyed the book but was disappointed that the plots and characters were not more fully drawn out. Perhaps if the bokk had been a wee bit longer, I would have felt more passionate about the resolutions."
5,Gran libro,"Alice Selbold trata con gran maestría el hecho tan reprobable como la violación y asesinato de una joven, ella misma fue en la universidad victima de una violación asi que sabe de lo que habla. En sus otros libros ""Afortunada"" (donde narra en primera persona este hecho) y ""Casi la luna"" se nos narra como diferentes mujeres (una niña, una chica joven y una abnegada hija que cuida de su madre) se encuentran en situaciones limite y como las afrontan e intentan superar. Para mí este libro me enseñó que dentro de la desgracia familiar que supone la desaparición de la pequeña Susie la familia sigue adelante no sin pagar un peaje alto por ello. No dejareis de leer hasta que acabeis la historia por lo que os recomiendo que compreis este libro. En definitiva es como la vida misma.Este libro no os decepcionará"
4,Uncut Version,"The IMAGE DVD version of this film is uncut. It's a question only a die-hard would have but when David Banner is sitting in the transponder in the Incredible Hulk Returns and the countdown is going, The Anchor Bay version cuts the commercial break out and it just splices the countdown very un-naturally with a few seconds of footage missing....but the IMAGE DVD restores this footage and is TRULY uncut with the commercial cliff-hanger intact."
4,"Not As Good As The Original Series, But Still Fun","While they certainly lacked the depth of the original series, these two movies were still ok in their own right. Sure, Don Blake shouting 'ODIN!' to summon the Norseman Thor in ""RETURNS"" was laughable, but I still liked the movie overall, and Lou Ferrigno seemed bigger than ever. Daredevil was handled slightly better in ""TRIAL"" however, although the costume was a bit blah. The extras on these discs are definitely interesting, including the ""STANDING TALL"" documentary of Lou Ferrigno and the as-always wonderful interview with Stan Lee.I wish they would release ""DEATH OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK"" on DVD, as this was by far the best of the three movies. Hopefully, with the upcoming theatrical movie sure to do wonderful box-office, someone will get the full original seasons moving toward DVD release."
1,Pfaltzgraff glasses,"I received several sets of these glasses and thought that maybe they were defective because they broke so easily. I purchased more and found that it is just poor construction. The lovely colors on the bottom of the glass match the dishes so beautifully, but if they last long enough without breaking, the color washes away leaving a plain clear glass. It is sad that such lovely glasses with a brand name attached to them, don't hold up well under everyday usage."
3,"Thanks for the ""help""","I don't understand why the same White Plains reviewer chimes in 3 times with the same complaint...it leads me to question the validity of the post. Why does Amazon's system allow this to occur? Hopefully this ""review"" won't be published but will lead instead to a correction of this situation. As I have not yet purchased these glasses, I am supplying a neutral 3 stars..."
5,Great Boot,"Took me about a week to break in, and this is my second pair. I wore my first pair out in about three years, wearing basically everyday."
2,"Great product, bad customer service",This boot has always been a favorite for my husband so I ordered him a new pair as his old ones were quite worn. We received them and oddly one show was smaller than the other so I contacted the seller and was told I needed to ship them back for an exchange. As instructed I shipped them back only to deal with lots of dead end emails to the company. Almost 30 days later and I emailed them again and was told that they were sorry for the confusion but would just refund my money??? I am not sure why they did that but I am glad I continued to follow through otherwise I may have been out of the shoes and the money I paid. Buyer beware and order through another company that stands behind their customer service!
2,"Disappointing quality, no longer a Skecher's fan...","I've always liked Skechers and have owned several pair and styles. But, the last pair of boots I bought didn't last long. The soles came unglued rather quickly. So, I spent a little more and purchased the Sergeants-Enlisted boots and the first time I tried them on, the lace hooks bent. After tying them (carefully) the second time I put them on, I wore them for about two hours. When I took them off, one of the lace clips fell off. I returned them for a refund as the price certainly exceeded the quality. It's not likely I'll buy Skechers again..."
2,"Too small, cheap-looking","I wear a size 7, and these boots were at least a half size too small, possibly a whole. I returned them and will not reorder. They don't look well-made and I'm afraid they won't hold up well."
5,Great boot at low cost,"This is my second pair I have purchased of this type and model. Boot wears out slowly - especially on the top and front where wear typically shows first. Sole eventually wears out, but wearing daily can last 2 years or longer. Very comfortable and flexes nicely, while standing up to abbasions well. I would recommend some type of conditioner if the boots will be exposed to water or liquids on a regular basis.Personaly, I prefer saddlesoap."
2,broken hood,"although I greatly enjoyed wearing these boots on the first day, the second day I had to return them to the seller due to the first hook on the right broke. The bottom part snapped when I was pulling on it to make sure it was a little tight before looping around the other side. I don't know if it was just the pair I got but i was very displeased with them lasting only till the second time i put them on. The seller was very helpful in making sure I got a refund and paid return UPS slip to return them immediately upon hearing about my problem."
4,These are good boots but I wouldn't be shy about going at least a half size smaller than what you normally wear. They get a,"These are good boots but I wouldn't be shy about going at least a half size smaller than what you normally wear. They get a bit loose. The other thing is that is you live somewhere really cold, then these boots don't do much to keep your feet warm.But they look good on you and they last at least a year"
1,Will not buy again,"This product does not work for me. I find it to be very ""heavy"" on my hair and does not take the yellow out."
3,Not for me,"I am sure, as I have heard that this is a great product so I will not give it a bad rating but it didn't work for ""me."" I noticed that my hair thinned out considerably and it was so subtle that I didn't realize that it was happening until I went to pin it up and noticed how thin my ""up-do"" was. I was trying to stop coloring my hair and go grey but I guess not! I still have half bottle left. I returned to coloring until I can figue out something else."
1,not for me,it made my hair hard. I have nothing else to say about this product. can i return and get my money back?I will let others know how I feel about this product. I didnn't know it would make my gray look purple. Who wants purple hair?I have seen women with a purple tint now I know what they are using. i don't like it for me
5,Gorgeous!,I could listen to it over and over - especially the duet from Bizet's Pearl Fishers and My Heart at Thy Seet Voice - in fact. all the performances were wonderful
4,Scary Beyond Imagination,"When I first heard the premise, my initial reaction two-fold: 1) despite the world's army of writers, this premise was well beyond anything that had yet been written, and 2) it made perfect sense. Motives effortlessly drive the characters, and although I admit that I needed to flex my imagination here and there to maintain belief, it is probable that this effort was largely due to the author's lack of writing experience (with only this book making them such.) The most frightening part of this book for me, although shocking, was not what happened to the girls, but the sympathy I found in myself for the perpetrators. With prevailing beliefs after WWII centering around sacrifice for country, the world was a very different place. Or was it?"
4,I like it but...,"I have the April Pattern and I like the butter dish except, the cover is so heavy, and it has no hadle or knob, that everytime I go to take it off it slips and/or falls and smashes the butter...little thing but it's annoying!!!I wish it had even just a small knob on top to grab it by. Other than that, its wear and tear is graet and I just pop it in the dishwasher!"
4,Winter Skills,"Little seen labour of love movie of the sharp and satirical Kennedy assassination trope by Richard Condon and, alongside the Manchurian Candidate and Prizzi's Honour, probably one of the best filmed adaptations of the author's work. Solid performance by a young Jeff Bridges as the brother of slain President seeking answers to the plot with standout cameos by Richard Boone, Anthony Perkins and - in particular - John Huston, in a role eerily similar to that also played by him in Chinatown."
1,The Worst Purchase Ever!,"I purchased this classic VHS tape ""Winter Kills"" which is a very good movie, so, why can't I watch it? The tape would not track on any of my 17 VCRs. On one VCR, the movie played in a few places, but faded to black & white over & over. I tried to return the tape to Amazon & then to the company, but, NO RETURN of my $. I'll NEVER buy from this company Again!!!"
2,Better for middle school than college,"Ok book with lots of illustrations, etc. But the book is entirely too brief and basic. I felt like I returned to middle school after I read the first section, and therefore never picked it up again. Waste of money for the audience it was intended for."
4,It did it's job!,"This book is a great general guide through science for life. Gives you the run down on cells, genes, dna, planet history, Etc."
5,Yellow-Flowered Acoustic Jams,"Yes, another B.B. release. Ha! The man's laid-back as all get-out, but he certainly has a work ethic. This disc was once again put out on his own imprint, Duna Records, & distributed by Cargo Records, who seem to distribute great records by great unsung bands...Speedbuggy USA, Broken Teeth, etc.""Tres Dias"" has eight tracks that sound like they coulda been performed to be played on an actual eight-track player. Bjork just always has a knack for putting out very acoustically oriented, laid-back jams. He feels as though he's a throw-back to a different decade. And I mean all of this in the most positive way imaginable. Another superb record by ""the Man"" and another reson to go buy it. Though B.B. fans never really need a reason, they just march down to their local record stores, plop down their cash & walk home with a smile on their face from ear to ear because they know exactly what they're gonna get. Another stellar set of tunez."
1,Predestined to not be Reformed,"There are many unambiguous scriptures with inductive and exegetical reasons to demonstrate that what these authors above contend is erroneous. I get tired of reading the same old talking points.But of course, even if it could be miraculously proved that Calvinism is actually exegetically correct, I just couldn't help but to believe it false because I was predestined to not be Reformed!"
3,Celtic Frames and Borders CD-ROM by Mallory Pearce,Book has been enjoyed by my husband. The book was in excellent condition.
2,Not for diabetic cats!,I thought I was getting Zobaline for diabetic cats! Not Xobaline - This has fructose in it so it is not for diabetic cats!
1,Thought this was for pets as advertised!,"When I ordered this under the pet section, the description did NOT mention it was sublingual. Have you ever used a sublingual medication on a cat? There is a pill form that it NOT subl, and that was what I thought I had ordered."
5,Awesome music for adults and kids........,You cannot go wrong with this download. You get a great sounding band organ that kids will love and adults will love it also. I own it and it is wonderful. Great for kids parties or adult listening.
5,Gil Shaham,I've loved Shaham since the first time I heard him; this recording lives up to my expectations and then some. He should be better known by the general public; he is one of our greatest violinists. Bravo
5,A great book on these models.,"This book is superb.Great photos,great text and the standard that the publisher's are known for.All mustang lover's will love this book.If you are an owner/would be owner or an enthusiast of these early models then this book is ideal for your book collection.Many more books on Ford Mustangs from this site."
5,Very nice,This is a very nice book to a very nice price. If you like mustang This book is for you. Do like me and buy it :)
1,Ugh!,"This book starts out interestingly enough, but it soon grows tedious due to the highly unbelievable actions and motiviations of its characters. The six protagonists act more like grade school children than adults, and they become fatiguing very quickly. The book is full of cliched platitudes about life, and the use of physical violence on the part of the women strikes another sour note. Was this supposed to be funny? The only positive thing I have to say about this book is that it's short, so the reader is soon put out of her/his misery in watching the unentertaining antics of people who need to grow up.This one isn't even worth borrowing from the library."
1,Family Blessings,"I have always enjoyed everything Fern Michaels has written, until Family Blessings. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It was silly, nondescript, had no ""meat"". I feel I wasted my money."
3,family blessings,"Story had a lot to be desired. So much negativity in a holiday story,I only got halfway through it! Maybe it had a happily ever afterending..???"
1,Worst Book I ever read,"It was hard to believe that such a bad book would be published.I have not read anything else by Fern Michaels,I imagine the other books must be better.She shows no talent for developing a story or characters in this one.I kept on reading,thinking it will get better,but it never did.Complete waste or time and money. I would give it 0 stars if there was such a choice."
2,Trite,"Loretta Cisco, a grandmother who raised her triplet grandchildren after their mother's death, is devastated when a tornado destroys her home and its contents. Somehow the loss of her home compels her to marry her longtime ""boyfriend"", but she is still concerned about the marriages of her grandchildren. Her granddaughters are married to doctors who spend long hours at the hospital. They have bought a boat which they keep secret from their wives, and somehow the women get the idea that their husbands are having an affair. They all miss their spouses when they're not together, but somehow dissolve into arguments every time they are together. Sam, the third triplet has been left by his wife because.....oh, does it really matter? This book is pretty silly as you can tell by the description of the plot. Don't waste your time."
2,Story was not very believable to me...,"I had a hard time reading this book. Grown adults were acting like ill-behaved children, acting out in ways that weren't plausible for young, successful adults. Secondly, I thought the plot was very weak. I was very disappointed after reading other books that the author had written."
1,Lowering Standards,"As someone who has always devoured books but felt sure I could never produce one myself, Fern Michaels has given new hope...yes, you CAN write something this awful and still get it published. I've never read any of her other books, so it makes me curious as to whether a whole slew of people are deluded enough to think that she is a good writer or if this book was just one embarrassingly bad moment of failure in an otherwise respectable writing career."
5,Heartwarming!,No one tells an emotional family story like Fern Michaels. She always makes you feel like you are part of the family as well as the story. Family Blessings is a heartwarming holiday book that you won't want to miss.
5,"Finally free, behind bars","""Predestination/free will is a complex and contradictory concept, and Bresson's prison metaphors adapts to this complexity."" Paul Scrader -in his book Transcendental Style in Film.Bresson is a formalist who avoids psychological acting, instructing his actors to be nonexpressive..like mannequins. He strips away all emotion and judgement (no tracking shots or camera angles..just straight on) He does'nt trust emotions, he's not documenting outer reality, he's documenting the reality behind the surface. He's a minimalist that strips down to bare form.Set against this iconography, is the fluid dance of the pickpockets hands..so subtle - you would not even realize that you had beeen touched."
3,Minimalist to the point of dullness,"The Bottom Line:Bresson's style can sometimes work wonders (e.g. A Man Escaped) but here it just leaves the audience wanting more from a story which, aside from one masterful montage of pickpocketing in action, never manages to be very interesting; a movie that feels long at under 80 minutes and is unable to drum up much audience interest, Pickpocket is unworthy of the reputation it possesses.2.5/4"
5,Total Classic,"Pickpocket might be the movie Dostoevski would have made if he had been a Director. It contains all of its themes : sin, nihilism, redemption through suffering. We want to praise its optimistic End : Sin, Suffering and Emprisonment made the hero able to reach the woman he loved."
3,Beautiful but boring,"Her technique is useless though her music is beautiful. It is boring, because she does't understand the rhythm and feature of each dance music.Recorded in 1994 and 95."
3,Dead of Night/The Queen of Spades,"This DVD set has a good image quality. However, the sound quality especially for Dead of Night has been altered to ""clean up"" noise and in doing so the audio seems to cut off and on in the most annoying way. I've owned this fine classic film in the other ""out dated"" formats (vhs and laserdisc) and preferred the little bit of hissing and scratching to having the sound go out completely during the more quiet moments. I really wonder who decides on these choices and if they're even checking the quality (or lack of ...) on the final product."
5,Awesome Book,I really enjoyed this book. It was very inspirational and insightful. The chapters are individual stories and the author does a great job of getting his points across.Read it because a friend suggested I read it and loaned it to me. I just had to have one of my own.
5,A Gift Which Keeps Giving,"I read this book years ago and have re-read it many times since. Each time I gain a new insight. I have given this book as a gift to many people. We now share insights over and over again! No matter if you are feeling down or up about life, this book helps! READ IT, LIVE IT ...."
4,Very good item.,"I love this bowl, I recommend people to gets this item, cause its a good prodcut at a good price."
1,plop!!!!!,"The worst movie I have ever seen! A giant turtle has a telepathic link with a Young girl? How dumb do producers think we are? In this movie the turtle has a rocket in his foot. You shouldnt look for mistakes, but they are so frequent! Especialy when you can see the strings!"
3,The Only one i liked,Well this one was cool and never looked at it as a Gamera movie. i just can not except a giant Turtle going around saving the world!
1,Apparently the universe consists of one planet!,"The so called update is bad stuff. The plot-line consists of alot of Atlantian nonsense to justify the existance of the creature. Bad FX shots like the creatures locked behind the horizon, never venturing to where the people are running around. Buildings that explode for no good reason, Gamera walking through a construction site, the girders explode from within each piece. Buildings scraped by the creature explode from the inside-out. Is Tokyo a storage house for nitro-glycerin or what? The ineptness is such that it could be mistaken for brilliant parody. The same could be said about Godzilla 2000. Gamera is full of meat!"
1,kaneko = bad plot parsimony,"What is it about this movie? That it stars Steven Seagal's daughter? Is it in the title that Gamera is a gaurdian of a universe that consists of only one planet? Is it the convoluted Atlantis plot angle which does little except spout mythic gibberish? Is it the monsters who are conveniently locked behind the horizon with people running in the foreground among city destruction? Or the buildings which explode on contact? Is Tokyo a storage house for Nitro Glycerin? Why do skeletal girders on a contruction site explode when touched? Is it made of C-4? Why are the FX work in this movie praised? The original kept it simple and had to explain less. This movie explains outlandish creatures with even more outlandish and convoluted explanations. All of which in turn need even more outlandish explanations than the original idea, none of which are actually followed through."
4,GAMERA THE GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE!,"A man-eating squad of three birds circle the sky. They are from an evil race. And now the giant turtle Gamera is out to stop him! Helpfully guided by a girl, Gamera struggles to defeat his birdy foes.....I reccomend this movie if you are the Toho Godzilla fan. It's a cool film. ..."
2,same stupid turtle,"Well, never been a big gamera fan so this one is pretty much the same as the earlier movies.the only good part was gamera and gaoys flying into space then back to earth during battle, pretty good special effects but gamera is still a dumb child loving monster. I think it's about time there was a gamera movie with no kids and the monster serisouly wrecking havic and killing millions."
4,GAMERA KICKS BUTT,"With a good script, a good director, and top-of-the-line special effects, GAMERA - GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE was considered during its release in 1995 to be the all-time best giant monster movie, a title it lost the following year to its own sequel. The DVD contains both the original Japanese dialog as well as the English dubbed. Do yourself a favor and watch the Japanese with English subtitles, as the dubbing--good as it is--glosses over some of the effective subtleties of the original script. This is a great sci-fi movie and can be enjoyed even by those who don't normally go into the giant monster movie genre."
3,Former second-string kaiju returns in a first-rate film!,"Those expecting the goofy Gamera of old will be delighted to know that this film is miles better than all of the classic Gamera series. Director Shusuke Kaneko, a man of extensive talent and vision, has created a fantastic kaiju film for both die-hard fans and the uninitiated viewer. Great pain is taken to lend believability to the monsters as well as to the story. The spfx are awesome; actually some of the best work since Tsubaraya. The miniatures, models, and pyrotechnics all exhibit a perfectionist's care in their execution. Good, well-developed characters and a good score all help to create an enjoyable viewing experience. Though not the best kaiju film ever made(the story is very much a reworking of classic Gamera scenarios, and you would have to literally deliver the moon to beat such classic gems as Godzilla, Ghidrah, the 3-Headed Monster and Monster Zero), Gamera is an excellent film that does any kaiju fanatic proud!"
5,Study or read?,"I ended up staying up half the night before finals to finish this book. I could not put it down. The characters drew me in, made me feel for them, want to help them......"
5,A strong social theme written with compassion--powerful.,"This is a believeable powerfull look at future life on this earth if we do not deal effectively with social, political, environmental, moral and ethicl issues. The message is ""must reading"" for all critical thinkers and visionaries, not just sci fi reader. The Carlucci books would make dramatic gut-wrenching movies."
3,Interesting adventure with some dubious plotting,"I haven't read a whole lot of cyberpunk, but most of what I have read (e.g., Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash) has been quite a bit better than this. Russo mixes a cyberpunkish background with a detective story, and gets something that is really not quite up to the best of either. The plot of this book needs tightening up--far too many pages pass with little or nothing happening in the case that is the center of the novel. And Russo doesn't quite have the voice of the inner-city cop down--try any of Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder mysteries to see a master of this genre at work. The premise here was interesting, and the narrative didn't flag, but I found a fair amount of the writing and reactions of the characters to be a little too predictable."
5,My special little book,"Can't find this small book on bookstore shelves; immense help to me through the stages of grieving..first for the death of my spouse, then my mom."
5,Very Helpful......,"This was one of the first books on Griveing I had bought. It was a Great ""pick"". The everyday ""passages"" hit right how I felt. The words were very comforting and like the author was writing this book for me to try to understand all the feelings and the ""loss"" I was going though. I Highly recommmend this book for a person who is going through a Loss of a Loved one."
3,annoying at first but then she grows on you,"Regina Spector recieved radio play at the station I listen to as well as having a short article in Newsweek. I purchased her CD based on these things . The first few listens of her CD annoyed me. There were too many ""clever hooks"" that she does with her voice. But, after about 10 listens, her music started to grow on me. Like alot of young artists, she brings a fresh perspective on perpetual themes but also has themes that are unusual. She plays the piano very well and her voice is clear and strong. I don't know if I will want to listen to her CD 5 years from now when it's lost the novelty but it's a good start for a young artist."
4,Short and Sweet,I like her style and her creativity. What a voice! Just wish the CD was a little longer.
4,Being odd is being interesting,"I had first heard about Regina 2 months ago, by listening to Fidelity song, and then I've decided to buy her new album - Begin to Hope . When it arrived, I was positively surprised by the oddity of some songs (I've bought the special edition album with few extra-songs). I think that Regina's lirics are pungent and I really loved her way of singing (despite of getting to sound alike Tori Amos and Bjork sometimes... for me, this would be kind of a homage or just a musical reference..). I Loved Regina!"
4,Will not annoy others on a road trip,"There's one part of preparing for a road trip I always dread: choosing CDs to bring along. The driver needs a good mix of songs and an upbeat tune to keep the him or her awake. At the same time, you need music that won't drive the other passengers nuts. Spektor's album fits the bill on both sides. I hope to find more like it."
5,Best Album Yet... Uplifting!,"I first heard of Regina Spektor on NPR and liked what I heard. I soon bought 11:11 and two songs off of Soviet Kitsch. Her voice is so beautiful that I can forgive her on what I consider her weirder songs (others may say avant garde, potato potahto).Braille on 11:11 became me and my fiancees favorite song, but it was mopey. The songs on Begin to Hope are somehow still eclectic but Fidelity, Better, Hotel Song, Apres Moi, On the Radio, Edit just make me smile. I listened to the album, especially Better, so much after getting it that my fiancee made me turn it off for a bit.I suppose in order to understand Regina you need to understand that she is a very musically talented young woman who truly enjoys making music and singing. Her songs capture this love of life. I have already begun to hope for the next album."
5,"Sweet, Surprising and Happy","If you're in the mood for something a little different,If you want some music that makes you feel good,If you like an album you can play straight multiple times,If you like female vocals,Regina's Begin to Hope is for you."
5,Amazing,"I am so in love with this CD, like you would not believe. regina Spektor is gifted beyond words. She herself is a well played instrument, her command of music and lyric is simply amazing. I recommend every person in the world own this work of art.It's a life changer."
4,Different,"Smart, great voice, very different sound for what we are used to listen right now. Beatyfull. She have a lot of talent."
4,Wonderful Singer/Songwriter,Regina Spektor is the latest in the line of women singer songwriters. Her classical training and haunting voice make this album an audio delight.
4,This is what preview is for UPDATED,"I bought this based on a $3.99 daily sale. I listen to and enjoy a wide variety of music so I think it's worthwhile to note that I took an instant dislike to this twee, precious, cutesy, yet simultaneously pretentious music. It sounds like something a hipster in chiclet-sized glasses and ironic t-shirt (but I'm repeating myself) would put on and then smirk at you as it played out.But that's only my opinion. If my words give you pause, I highly recommend you use the preview feature before purchasing this.UPDATE: All is forgiven. I regret my low star rating as this music has really grown on me in the past few days. Spektor's voice somehow set off a ""cutesy"" alarm in my head. I should have known better, as I have been a frequent defender of Kate Bush to my friends who find her voice too precious and screechy. I have upgraded the review from 2 stars to 4 and will doubtless enjoy discovering other Spektor material. The music shows real passion and artistry."
3,has some good tracks,"Samson, Hotel Song, Apres Mois and On the Radio are really good tracks. Unfortunately, the rest are bland and her voice isn't that great (she tends to hit really flat and cringe-worthy notes). All in all, it is a cute album, with a few really nice songs. I would be curious to see how she would produce her own work, though."
4,Grey's Anatomy soundtrack fans will love this,"Only 1 or 2 songs that don't seem to quite hit the mark, but if you enjoy the indie style music found on Greys then you will really enjoy this CD."
4,Fresh & New!,"Never having heard of Spektor before seeing her video for ""Fidelity"" on Youtube, I was instantly interested. Her voice is quite unique, & the music she's written compliments it perfectly.A must-have for any who enjoy excellent/different music."
2,"Some good, some bad...","This cd has a few AWESOME songs on it. It also has a few AWFUL songs on it. First and foremost, I HATE any kind of drug reference, and had I known there would be some on this cd, I would have passed on it. So, with that said, I enjoyed the first 4 songs or so, and didn't like the rest. Very unique voice, great talent, but I think she needs someone to take her under their wing and help get her going with some good stuff that doesn't involve any drugs. We just don't need it. Call Mutt Lange. Maybe he can give you a clean boost to get those few great song hooks into the charts. Can I get my money back and just buy the first two songs?"
2,"Step down, and wecome to planet Earth","This is not important. An egocentric voice, not very willing to communicate with the listener. I have tried but most of it is just passing me by. I like voices trying to make a personal style but she seems more interested to imitate someone else. Whoever that can be does'nt make me more happier about this kind of acting."
5,Most original S/S I've heard in years,"I love Regina Spektor's music. She is so original. Kind of weird, but a true artist. The production on the CD is spectacular. It's her best yet. Favorite songs: On the Radio, Fidelity, Apres Moi, & BetterOther artists I like: Fiona Apple, Lily Allen, Amy Winehouse, Tina Dico, Missy Higgins, Imogen Heap."
3,Regina for the Masses,"It didn't take me long to realize that this album is radically different from Soviet Kitsch. Compared to that album, Begin to Hope is over-produced and bland at times. I love about half the songs, but the rest are forgettable. She's obviously aiming for a much wider audience this time around, and I suppose I can't fault her for that. I miss the manic energy of the last album though. But regardless of her departure from Soviet Kitsch, I think that too many of the songs on Begin to Hope are uninteresting and just don't go anywhere. It's funny, though, because the songs that I do like are really terrific. I've listened to the album a number of times over the past couple days, but I find myself skipping through the tracks to get to the ones I like. I still think Regina's a great talent, but I think that in making a radio-friendly album she's given us one that isn't quite up to her potential."
4,"Still a great, fresh album, years after I first heard it","It does seem that I only review albums I am really excited about - love to share the love so to speak.This one, I have had for a few years, but still rocks my world - a really fresh album of an obviously huge talent - am not sure she has topped this yet, with her incredible quantity of output, but when she does, I will be there! In the meanwhile, buy this one; it is definitely a keeper."
4,"Quirky, great music","I first hear ""The Hotel Song"" on pandora.com and was blown away by it. I bought the MP3 album of this a few days later and love Ms. Spektor's voice and quirky tempos and lyrics.I highly recommend her music for those that like Feist, Goldfrapp, or Dido. Check it out!"
5,Perfectly novel...,"Admittedly, I am a book reviewer at heart, and typically leave the music reviews to those who are more qualified. However, I find that I simply cannot keep my mouth shut on this one. Spektor has revived my faith in music. She is fresh, and new, and unlike anyone else I have heard lately. Call me crazy, but being a child of the 80s, she puts me in mind of Cyndi Lauper with all of her seemingly quirky and funloving antics. With all of the poseur garbage coming out in the last seven (or so) years, I can only say that I find Regina Spektor to be fresh, fun, and for once, unique. Forget downloading! This is a CD you must own."
4,good second,"I saw Regina Spektor play recently in Los Angeles. It was at the El Rey Theater. It was sold out. There was an excitement in the air, which you imagine there was for the Beatles. Regina Spektor has a lot of young female fans. Maybe it was some girls who saw her play a few years ago opening for the Strokes or Kings of Leon? Anyway I have seen her play a few times now, and the audiences are getting bigger and more enthusiastic. This is the sort of audience that you get for Bjork or Joanna Newsom. Everyone is quiet and on the edge of their seats. They hang on to every word. The first album was quirky and sort of fit in with the anti-folk thing. This record is a more planned out thing. It's a better-produced record. There are some really poppy songs like ""Better."" This sounds like a hit for anyone else. This record has more experience behind it, and Regina has grown up a little bit. She sounds really good. Not a weak moment on here. Even Nick Valensi of the Strokes appears on a song."
2,Not her best by far,What a disappointment. I should have bought the songs individually and then I would only have paid for two as that's all I've found I can even listen to. She is all over the place and needs some direction. This is a failure and I hope she will improve with her next album.
3,Way out there,"If you're into Regina Spektor, you might like this album. If you're not (and are just buying it for 'Fidelity,' that song they play on the radio), you probably won't. This album is full of bizarre, discordant sounds and lyrics. I was unpleasantly surprised."
3,Disappointing,"I loved a couple of her songs - Fidelity and Samson - so I bought the cd thinking the rest of the songs would sound similar. To my disappointment, they weren't really like my favorites at all. Needless to say, I think I might sell the cd."
2,"2-3 good songs, lots of filler","I really like Regina Spektor's voice and her piano playing. The first song, ""Fidelity"", reeled me in. That song is just addictive, and along with ""Better"" and ""Hotel Song"", has great hooks and recognizable song structure.However, she seriously needs to work on her songwriting. The rest of the CD sounds like she sat down at the piano and made up the songs as she went along - not a good thing. They often sound like she's not sure what to do with the song but just keeps on making stuff up until she reaches the 3- or 4-minute mark. Meandering, changing course, it's self-indulgent and not that interesting. (Don't even get me started on the bonus EP.) Definitely not a CD you can listen to over and over each day.I want to LOVE Regina Spektor, I really do, but she needs to reign in her self-indulgence and work on crafting actual songs. Once she's got that down, she will rule."
5,Loads of Fun (but not for the whole family),"The autobiography of Cassanova is a wonderful story, the Willard Trask translation brings the adventures of histories most famous ladies man to life in VERY explicit detail. Not for the faint of heart, but a great readBe warned though: there are other translations that are just horrible, avoid the Penguin version at all costs. Also, it's worth knowing that the book is unbelievably long, the origional version had 10 volumes and the one for sale here only includes 1 and 2, the entire set put together is several thousand pages.Still if you are going to read Cassanova, THIS is the version to get, if you want to finish the story you'll just have to buy 4 more books with the rest of his volumes."
3,"fascinating to a point, but it just goes on and on...","Casanova's life was amazing, with enough adventure and intrigue to fill... well... volumes and volumes of text. Unfortunately, that's exactly what he decided to do, and while much of it is interesting and involving, after a while I just kept saying 'how much longer does this go on?' Certainly worth reading, but pace yourself or your head will go numb."
2,Eh...Not so sure it was worth it,"The typeface was poor quality that you'd typically find in old printing (somewhat blurry, etc.). Wasn't expecting that for a book written in the 90's. I would recommend looking for a different, newer version. Had I taken a look at the book before I probably would've opted for a different one or just settled with finding chords online."
4,Been chasing this one for years,"Must admit first that i am into American Locomotives, more than i am the Civil War. So having spent many years at the Saturday Cinema shows as a child watching westerns, i developed a fascination for those locos with cow catchers and big smoke stacks so when this ' little gem ' became available it was a' must have ' for me for my railway film collection.An interesting point about this DVD is that as the 'Extra Features'offered to us are that of, on one side of the disc the film is in Widescreen (2.35:1 ratio)whilst on the other side its a Full frame presentation. Great to have the choice, content wise i feel it is good quality entertaiment."
4,Great History,"Classic Disney movie, mostly upbeat seems a liuttle one sided. Civil war Medal of Honor recipients"
4,A Good Movie,This movie is about a true event that happened during the Civil War.A group of yankee spies went south to hijack a train called the General while the crew got off for breakfast at Big Shanty.William Puller who was in charge of the train wanted to get it back so he chased after it.It was a great movie with alot of action and history rolled up into one great movie.
3,Not quite what we expected...,"I remember seeing this movie decades ago on the old Disney TV program. I had looked for it on DVD or at our library, but found that it was not available. Thus, when I was recently offered a free $2.00 coupon for Amazon Instant Video, this was the movie I selected.My family was excited about seeing it, especially when they saw that Fess Parker was in it (we are long-time Davy Crockett fans), and, in general, we enjoyed the movie. However, we were shocked when the ""D"" word was used several times in the movie.We have viewed other old movies on DVD/VHS that I saw years ago on TV and have been surprised when language showed up that I was not expecting due to it having been edited out for TV. However, to find that in an old Disney movie was much more of a surprise."
5,Great Movie!,This was a good family movie. I purchased from a vendor affiliated with Amazon and their price and service was fantastic!
3,Good Historical Account,"This was a good film. However, it's a little dated. We recently visited Kennisaw, Georgia, the home of ""The General"". The General is one of the locomotives involved in the chase. If it were not for that visit to the museum, I would not have followed this movie. A lot of scenes in the movie assumed you had prior knowledge of the circumstances. The kids were somewhat interested, I had to keep reminding them about what we saw in Georgia."
1,One of my favorite movies of all time but horrible quality DVD,"Rather than going into details on what is one of my favorite Disney live-action movies of all time, I thought it was important to get another warning out regarding the APPALLING transfer quality of this DVD. While the DVD is barely watchable with color and other image fluctuations, Disney is completely irresponsible releasing this movie with such poor quality control, it frankly says to me they don't care and I suppose Hannah Montana and other modern-day brain candy makes them more money."
3,re: new version dvd,the new version dvd (with the painting of the locomotive cover) is a full-frame only version. knowing this would've saved me some heartache (and money)
5,Excellent old fashioned Disney,"We have just moved to Georgia from England. I bought this as a little surprise for my husbands birthday...Excellent film. Funny to see what would have been 'the latest' film techniques. Good old fashioned Disney!A brave but sad story... If your kids are learning about history and the Civil War, I would recommend this - full of Civil War history, local history, rail road history, spies and bravery, but not the awful blood and guts of war. Good to show them too - film making pre Pixar / Dreamworks?"
3,The Great Locomotive Chase was ok but not great.,The movie was good but not as great as some of the other movies. It was still very enjoyable to watch
5,The Great Locamotive Chase,"I am reading ""Stealing the General"" now and it makes the movie even more inviting to see again. You will love it just like I did."
3,Good idea for a movie.,"This movie, it is said, was made because Walt Disney loved trains and wanted a good train story to make. The plot itself is a great one, being rooted in history. The problem is that watching Fess Parker act is like watching toast do....well...nothing. It's really boring. The production value is great, and the guy who plays William Fuller steals the show. The punches are all air, and there's not a drop of blood in the whole thing. It's a mercenary spy story set in the Civil War, for goodness sake! I want to remake this movie."
2,"Excellent Film, Disappointing DVD","Read the other reviews for a plot synopsis. Be aware that this film is presented in ""Letterbox"" widescreen, not anamorphic (although the menu pages & even the copyright warning page are anamorphic widescreen). The picture quality is mediocre, as is the sound. I thought that Disney (who released the original film to the theaters in 1956) would treat this film with some respect, but alas, as seems to be happening with all major studios' DVD releases now, they appear to be taking the cheapest way out. The film is a very good historical action piece that deserves better, especially from Disney. I just hope they treat the upcoming Davey Crockett release better."
1,Looks good but not very useful,These were a nice addition to my set but I can't get salt or pepper out of either on of them. I think the holes are just too small.
1,"Not a moving story, neither good, bad or indifferent.","Dull, over implied metaphors to make some ""sort of"" impact that comes off like an insiders only tale. Is this what we have to expect from our writing program Graduate students? Who is she doing this for and what is the reason? Obviously just for herself and those who know her..Invisable Sign For Me is just that, for Aimeme. This story is not for me or anyone who wants a well developed story that respects the reader. This story could be summed up by the phrase coined by Gertrude Stein: There's no there, there."
5,"Odd, enchanting","Aimee Bender's poetic style is perfectly suited to this strange but transfixing novel about an obsessive compulsive teacher's and her journey toward emerging from her self-imposed emotional cocoon. I wouldn't call it an enjoyable read per se, but I certainly enjoyed this novel and its bizarre protagonist. I was never sure whether to laugh, cry, or be disgusted, especially during the unforgettable axe scene. I have rarely found books so imaginative and relishsome as this one."
5,Blown away,"I think Aimee Bender is really amazing. Her book is able to be funny, dark, and poignant all at the same time. Her prose has a voice that is purely her own. Kudos! I can't wait till the next one."
2,Creative Writing Student's Wet Dream,"This little jewel of a book reminded me of what a lazy, self-absorbed, creative writing student desperately wishes would happen to her life. Granted Mona is disguised as a math geek...whose knowledge is limited to 3rd grade math. She is hired as an elementary-school math teacher without any credentials or college education. In fact, the job is practically forced upon her when the school principal calls her at her home recalling a summer years ago when the she spotted Mona in a park doing long-division. I kept thinking ""You're 19, have your own place, and a good job. Your quirks and emotional unrest are not going to draw sympathy from me. They are going to make me think you are a little turd.""As a math buff myself, I was constantly annoyed. Mona doesn't love math. She is not good at math. She is good at arithmetic."
4,A haunting psychedelic number,"A facsinating read by a really talented writer. The way the story moves through the eccentric hallways of a math lover's mind. The flow is beautiful, symmetric and flavoured with sticky dark humour. This is the first of Aimee Bender which I read. Her other books are already in my reading list."
3,"Very cute, sweet story, but needs a reality check","I'm presently in the middle of this book and can't help but stumble over little details.For instance, Mona is 19 years old, and moves out, but doesn't yet have a job. What place will rent to her w/o her having a work history, or money?And she immediately gets a job as a math teacher, without any kind of degree or credential. In most places in the US, one must have a credential to teach, except in some private schools.In addition, except in some private or alternative schools, grammar school generally consists of one teacher, one room, one grade, until one reaches middle school. And while multiple classes with multiple teachers *does* happen [I went to such a school], this is the exception, not the rule.So why isn't it mentioned Mona teaches in a private school? I know I'm picking nits, but little reality issues like this irk me and keep me from otherwise enjoying an otherwise enjoyable story..."
4,Densitometer not needed,"Oh these stories are so lovely and wow they really touched my heart. And the teacher character who eats soap is oh so touching. Gosh this really makes me happy. I love this book so much, kind of like, like the stepford wife for the bizarre. I just feel like this is it, so pleasant, comfy in the darkness of my unknowingness yet true to the whole. There is nothing that makes me so proud as this story."
5,LOVE IT,"Aimee Bender used to be my elementary school teacher and would create stories for us at the end of every class we had with her. So when I found this book, I knew that I would instantly love it as much as her book of short stories. I was right, this book is the best of Aimee Bender bringing a surreal quality to her heroine Mona. I'm so excited that this book is going to be a movie that I can't wait to see it. I only hope that the movie can do justice to this wonderful masterpiece written by one the best authors. I only hope that my former teacher will write more so that my collection of her works grows."
4,Weird and wonderful,"Coping with dying is difficult, but this book gives the reader an interesting perspective on how one can go on living when someone close to them is ill or dying. Wearing our heart on our sleeve, or a number on our chest, doesn't guarantee that we'll be noticed or treated differently. Mostly, we are left to deal with life's troubles on our own. However, if we find like-minded souls in the world, and we reach out to them, we can help each other embrace our time on earth as a gift, while at the same time letting go of those who must move on. Although this story has many weird aspects and quirks (which I find refreshing), it also holds an important message for anyone who cares to notice."
3,Well researched: but be willing to get all the details,"This is a fascinating topic and one of those 'lost stories' that, thanks to this book, is no longer lost. Spear's research is impeccible. Here is my warning: if you want all the gory details about the equipment and the politics and the characters (and you will want to make your own scorecard) then you will love this book (5 stars!). Otherwise, you may find yourself starting to skip some paragraphs, and maybe even some pages, as the bureaucratic skirmishes wax and wane. Overall, Spear has done a good job of weaving together a complicated story and I would recommend this to anyone interested in the control of invasive species or anyone interested in the intersection of science and public policy."
5,As much a story of Massachusetts politics as of gypsy moth facts,"The release of the gypsy moth in North America prompted a series of circumstances which brought Massachusetts into a decade-long war against the insect, here recounted in The Great Gypsy Moth War: A History Of The First Campaign In Massachusetts To Eradicate The Gypsy Moth, 1890-1901. From the early influences on the campaign when entomologists were fascinated by the alien invader to growing frustrations with its tenacity and a series of political and social interventions which affected the fight, The Great Gypsy Moth War is as much a story of Massachusetts politics as of gypsy moth facts."
3,short and sweet...,"for a small gift/rememberance book it is very cute, for a cookbook...well, I've seen better. BUT, that's not really the point of the book anyway. Simple Pleasures is eye candy, comforting for the body and heart. Many of the recipes and tried and true old fashioned comfort food recipes like homemade hot cocoa or meatloaf. Honestly though, some looked a little -bleck-like blueberry-buttermilk ice cream or chocolate zucchini cake-LOL.Good for a quick gift for a friend or aqquaintence-I wouldn't pay more than 2 bucks for it myself though.3 stars."
5,"Great Leather, Great Feel","This is my second pair of these puppies. The leather is soft, good arch support, nice look. I just wear through them too quick."
3,dissapointing!,"Karajan was one of the best conductors of 20th century. But he is not a Mahlerian. He always seeks for good and powerful sound and he takes from his BPO. This is the case in first and second movements of this recording. But be careful! Where is the sentimentalism, sickness, depression, desperate? Where is the musical Hades and Olimpos peak of Mahler's world? Where is Mahler's demons and ultimate joy? Nothing. BPO sounds like music box(maybe first time in their discography); press the button, and now Mahler 5! Karajan jumps and cries ""here I am! I show you wonders."" But this is Mahler. So he falls. This recording is a scandal for Karajan. But it is not important. Karajan is a Karajan and Mahler is a Mahler.Go for Bernstein on DG, Abbado, even Rattle on EMI ... whoever else! But if you want a really special, thrilling version, try Leinsdorf, Boston Symphony, 1963 recording on RCA!"
2,Karajan does injustice to Mahler,"I bought this CD based on all the positive reviews on Amazon. I also have to admit that I am a huge Karajan fan.But I am disappointed. I don't feel this is how Mahler should be handled.Karajan does his best but he gives it what I would describe a classical treatment. As a result, he missed out on the highs, the lows, and the emotions that should be associated with this music.Also I think the range in dynamics is disappointing. There are stretches were the sound is too low (minor issue though).The Adiagietto is still one of the best.I love the version by Daniel Barenboim. Bernstein from the 60's is also not bad (except for recording quality)."
2,Karajan Misses with This Mahler,"This recording is not worth even the [low] price; for it is ruined -- Karajan completely loses control of his orchestra (rare, indeed, for him) at the end of the 5th movement. It is jarring, and simply destroys the whole piece."
4,"Good, but not the best.","I'll keep this short. This is an excellent performance. The Berlin Philharmonic plays superbly, and Karajan has some very interesting things to say in his interpretation. The big flaw however is in the recording engineers. The sound is harsh and irritating, as was the norm for DG in the 60's and 70's. Their engineers simply did not have the skill and competence of the Decca and EMI engineers. My recommendation is for the Barbirolli recording with the Philharmonia Orchestra on EMI. Barbirolli delivers a stunning performance, and the EMI engineers deliver a decent recording (much better than the Karajan recording). If you want more modern sound, there are a number of great recordings (Bernstein, Abbado, etc.)."
5,vintage Karajan,"This performance will infuriate some and enthrall others, there is hardly middle ground in opinion. Speaking only for myself, this remains one of my favourites among Mahler 5ths, due to the opulence and beauty of the BPO and the surprising amplitude of the recording. The adagietto is not played too slowly and is none the worse for that. The brass chorale at the coda of the finale is a frisson making moment and the BPO plays it to the hilt. Barbirolli and Sinopoli, among others, have recorded this work very well too and picking an outright winner is a judgment call. If you like a heavily saturated, go-for-the-jugular Mahler sound, and have enjoyed other Karajan recordings of his symphonies - the later 9th is arguably the best of all - this can be recommended."
3,Good for my headaches...,I bought my ijoy chair about 5 years ago. I love the chair & it really helped out on those stressful headache filled days. After a couple of years some of the programs like going up & down on certain spots stopped working on the chair & then a year or two later the rest of the features stopped working except for the rolling up & down. I'm trying to decide if I want to get another chair but not sure I would spend another $500 or $600 for a chair that may not last that long... but I did enjoy it while it worked.
5,Satisfied consumer,"great value, good service saved many $$$. Looked for this product at the big box stores, two or three times the cost. found this and it was exactly what we needed."
4,Good replacement,"These stainless steel heat plates fit perfectly, but are not of the same quality as the OEM part. At 30 bucks for the set, I am happy with my purchase and fully expect them to last for several years."
2,Do not fit without modification,"Modification was definitely necessary for this to fit my grill. At this price, these should fit from the get go. If you buy these, plan on a lot of work, these are not easy to bend. I don't mind the work, but not when they are advertised to fit, and at almost $40 each I expect more."
3,Good Motion Segment,"This DVD has a very nice motion segment that teaches young cheerleaders basic motions. However, it only teaches a few cheers and chants."
5,New Cheer Squad,"My girls needed instruction on how to do proper jumps and they needed a hip hop routine. They loved it and when they performed for their school, they got a standing ovation."
1,MISLED,I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYBODY LOOKING FOR DANCE MATERIAL!!! IT HAS ONE VERY BASIC DANCE ON IT AND THAT'S IT!!!! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
2,Very Bland,"I purchased the video for my daughter, and we were both very disappointed. First of all the length of the video was very short. There was nothing on jumps. They showed only one dance routine. My daughter is so into gymnastics/cheering and this video was no interest to her. I believe it was the worst birthday present she received. Another DVD to collect dust."
4,cheerific,"I purchased this for my daughter just before her 7th birthday. It has kept her more active this winter. She enjoys the warm up stretch, the cheers and the dance moves. I got this just for fun but she has surprised me with how much she has learned. She now knows the names of many of the arm positions. This dvd is good for those girls who dream of being a cheerleader when they grow up. have fun."
2,not for the experienced,I bought this dvd hoping for a fun workout to remind me of my high school days. Unfortunately anyone who has ever cheered before will not learn anything new from the dvd. The dvd is also not long or involved enough to work up a good sweat. It would probably be cute and educational for the aspiring cheerleader but is not worthy of its place among the workout tapes of today.
2,Doesn't quite work for me,"I was planning to use the 50' hdmi cable to connect, directly, my laptop (Acer with HDMI output) to a HDTV(Samsung). I have to return it because maybe I might have received a defective one.Essentially, the issue is that the adapter of the hdmi cable seems to have ""bad contact"". With hdmi, you plug it in and it is supposed to work. However, with this 50' cable, it will lose signal or show funky color(dark scenes/portion) unless I bend the adapter a little or adjust the angle of the adapter attached to the laptop a little. I don't know if this issue is related to the length of the cable or not, but if I held on or keep bending the adapater, it seemed to work fine(for the couple minutes that I tried). I tried connecting the laptop with a short hdmi cable and I didn't have this issue, so I know it's not the TV or the laptop's adapter...Overall, I'd say that if the cable works, it would have been a good deal...but for me, I had to return it because it's defective. Bummer."
3,"A divider, not a uniter","Violin mavens aren't middle-of-the-road, any more than opera buffs. Mutter typically divides opinion strongly about whether her highly technical, extremely detailed and personal playing is a sign of exceptional musicianship or the opposite: a self-absorbed fussiness that ignores the composer so that everything can focus on herself.I fall into the latter group. To my ears this is an impossibly fussed-over Sibelius concerto, with hardly a natural phrase to be heard. I won't go into detail--what's the point? The consensus here seems to be that this is a gorgeous woman playing a gorgeous violin in a gorgeous virtuosic romp. Okay."
2,Sound and...what?,"Mutter has got a really fabulous tone and it is always pleasing to listen to the sound of her violin. But musicmaking requires something beyond the mere tone, I believe. Where are the rhythm , musical idea, and especially,'CONSISTENCY' that support the flow of music in Mutter's Sibelius? Previn and Dresden Staatskapelle are wonderful and together struggle to cover the shortcomings of the soloist."
4,A Hive of Busy Bees (Don and Joyce),This book series was absolutely captivating when our teacher read them to our class. 25 years later I've finally gone to Amazon to find them and order them for my daughters. Each chapter has a life lessons that is presented in a very interesting way. Students from 2nd to 6th grade loved these books.
1,Hilfiger socks gone bad!,"These socks were much inferior to the previous ones I have purchased. They were ultra thin and very tight, no give to the fabric!"
4,Good album,"This is a good album. The reason i didnt give it 5 stars is that i am not feeling the beats as much. Some of the beats are really nice, like windows, and the immigrant, but there are some weak tracks lyric wise and beat wise on this album. The content of a few tracks on this album just doesnt fit with the flow of the rest of the album. It is well worth the money though, the good tracks on this album amazed me. Windows is one of the stand-outs. Buy it, although not ALL the tracks are first-rate, the album is well worth it."
5,A decent hits album,"The Millennium collections are pretty good discs with remastered sound. The edition for Cinderella, is a good example. Cinderella was one of the best 80's classic metal bands. They were influenced by Aerosmith, and it shows. The vocals sound very similer to the raspy singing of Nazareth. Blues and Zeppelin hard rock dominate the music. Like Great White, Cinderella was one 80's band that had musical talent, and that was the main attraction, not their looks."
4,"""Glam"" but Classic","While this is a collection of their best hit singles, there were a few that were missing, especially ""Back Home Again"", which to those who prefer the harder edge of Heavy Metal, the omission of this song is rather disappointing. However, the album does catch the essence of the band, who although presented itself as a Hard Rock band people labeled them as a Glam Rock band. Glamour and big hair was their signature look, but this was one of the few ""Glam Rock"" bands who actually had talent. Their bluesy-hard edge was a little ahead of their time, but all-in-all they earned the right to be called Classic."
2,THIS ONE COULD BE BETTER,"Very good music and band, sadly this cd only last 55 minutes when technology allows to hold 80 minutes,NO value-add, there are a lot of great songs that could be added, adding songs such as: Night songs, Push, push, more from ""still Climbing"" album songs could do a diferent and good product (road still long, Blood from Stone, All comes donw, etc).May be adding the songs from ""Still Climbing"" album, spliting them on the still-on-print 3 albums can do a different and value-add albums, remastering and adding some b-sides or unreleased. This way old music on a diferent way and on NEW format could get new fans and better selling levles"
3,Probably not for the Purists,"I like what this album is - a good cross section of Cinderella's best known stuff, and for that it's good. There is a lot though that is ""missing"" from what could have been a ""GREATEST HITS"" ... and other reviewers have listed the ""missing"" tracks. None the less, this CD regularly finds itself on my player and I never grow sick of it. That said, it's not the first CD I would buy if I lost my collection, but it sure as hell wouldn't be last on the list either."
2,The Best Of?,"How could anyone call this glam metal? The first two or three songs are good, they are the only stuff that keeps this cd from being a one star thing. However,the rest of the songs are bluesy and they are NOT any kind of heavy metal, let alone glam. If you are a heavy metal fan stay far away from this or any Cinderella cd for that matter."
5,Just Darling!,This is a sweet little trumpet voice in the great symphony of Zion! Two missionaries of unquestioned character assassinate the characters of religious people who don't believe just as they do! Get the pre-2003 release and relish the Church's reasoned defense of a racist priesthood! Just darling! Get it for your missionary's 'farewell' today! A reasoned defense of the Church's Stalinesque historical revisionism! Can you spell 'revisionism'?
1,Don't waste your money,"The photo is quite deceiving. This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap, shiny, and is horrible to the touch. My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness. Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit!"
3,You decide,"This is a very easy to use piece of hardware. I got it for the mic output since it was used for my logitech speakers. It worked perfect for about a month, then the batteries died. So i spent almost $5 on a pair of two, and it blew thru those two in another month. since there is no way to chance the input without the remote, your out of luck till you buy new batteries.Outstanding product if you dont mind having LOTS of batteries waiting for when it eats the others."
2,Only got 3 buttons,"I got my package today, and it was supposed to be fulfilled by Amazon. The bag the buttons were in looked like it was played with a lot, and 3 of the buttons are subsequently missing! All I got were the Dealer, Small Blind and Big Blind buttons. I didn't get the Reserved, Kill, or Missed Blind buttons. Quite disappointing for a product that's supposed to be new, and it looks like it wasn't.I want to exchange it for another one, but since it's sold by Chips and Games and fulfilled by Amazon, I can't do an exchange. I can only return it for a refund, and then would have to buy it again, and find another $20 in items for free shipping. Thing is, shipping will cost more than this item is worth.Overall, not very happy."
3,"Great product, if I had received what was advertised.","As part of a ""sexy card dealer"" halloween outfit, I thought it would be cute if I super glued these buttons randomly on my outfit. I ordered this product because of all the cute sayings (not a poker player).What I got when they arrived, 3 days before halloween was 6 buttons that all said DEALER. I was mad because the advertisement said I would get 1 big dealer button and 5 smaller ones like the picture depicts. Not so. With out any other option I had to warp my plans, but I was frustrated I didn't get what was advertised.Communicate with the seller before you buy this set."
5,Good,Easy install on my 06 Honda shadow aero instructions kinda crazy but easy to figure out without looks great min tools needed did in 5 min
3,I thought it would be heavier quality,Very unhappy with the quality. the lid isn't hinged so you need a place to put it when you are removing from or adding to the fryer. It seems a little tinny. The plug is magnetic and if you are not careful it comes undone and your food sits in the oil. When it cooks its cooks great I haven't cleaned it yet so cannot review the drain system.
2,Great for a year....,"This deep fryer was terrific - for a year. I loved the way it cooked plus cleanup was a cinch. But then it just stopped heating and nothing I did (including pushing the reset button) could get it working again. I've never been crazy about the way the plug inserts in the back of the fryer - for safety, I suppose, it's magnetic and didn't ever seem to be fully connected the way I would have liked. But that wasn't the problem with heating either. I called Customer Service and they told me the only thing I could do was take it to the nearest service center - which is over 100 miles away. I'm buying a different brand for a lot less money. If I knew it was only going to last a year, I never would have invested $100 in it!"
2,deep fryer,"DeLonghi D14522DZ Dual Zone 4-Liter Deep FryerI purchased a DeLonghi fryer very similar to this one. ( I don't know the model number, but the features are the same). It has the magnetic cord connection and the drain spout. It fryed the food as it should but we only used it about three times in the first year and it wouldn't work anymore after that. The company does not have repair parts available, but then what would you expect, it's made in China. They want you to pack it up and ship it out for repair. There is a $24.95 charge for them to set it on their work bench.The magnetic cord is a pain to connect and keep connected. It tends to fall off or break the connection too easily. I would hard wire that if I could get the part for the electrical repair. I would not recommend this brand to anyone."
2,Too fragile,"This is a good fryer - as far as it goes. It works nicely, has some good features that make it easier to clean than an old-fashioned bucket-type fryer. But it has a glaring design flaw. The heating unit attaches to the metal frame using a plastic bracket. If that bracket breaks - and, believe me it will - the unit becomes useless. That heating unit has to be securely attached to the frame in order to operate and once that bracket cracks, there is no way to operate the unit. Might as well flush $89 down the toilet. I am on my third unit and it has happened every time. I recommend avoiding this machine until DeLonghi replaces the plastic bracket with a more durable metal one. With that change, I would give this unit a clear five stars."
1,Inferior Quality,The deep fryer worked great for the few times it worked. The product only lasted a few times as plastic parts on the housing did not hold up to the heat. The holder for the heating element cracked after just a few uses making it inoperable. The part to replace is as expensive as the unit making it about $20.00 per use. Not a good ROI! Will not purchase DeLonghi products in the future.
5,A Prized asset to my Kitchen,"This is my 5th deep fryer. None of the ones I've had before can hold a candle to this one. It is all the manufacturer says it is. The stainless steel 'bowl' is a dream to clean. The ability to drain the 'bowl' through a spigot makes saving the oil a pleasure. I'm sure I will never have to buy another deep fryer again. The stainless steel construction (as opposed to aluminum for all the ones I've had before), and easy cleaning allow me to use this one a lot more frequently than others allowed. The heating element located slightly above the bottom of the 'bowl' does in fact provide a cool area below the heating element."
2,Worked fine twice then stopped working at all,"This was a gift and we only used it twice, to make Rosettes, a dainty scandinavian Christmas cookie. So I wasn't even that hard on the thing. When we tried to start it up this last Christmas to make the cookies it wouldn't turn on. I jiggled the heating device and it would turn on only briefly. Looks to be an electronic issue."
4,Missing some key features,"I own this fryer and it works well. It has a deceivingly large capacity.The pros1. Heats up fast2. It's tall so you don't get the bubbly over of hot oil like some fryers3. Cleans easy enough for a deep fryerThe Cons:1. Doesn't have timer so you will need to watch what you fry2. doesn't have a buzzer to let you know when the oil has reached the temperature you setOverall it is a good fryer, just wish it had a beeper to let you know when the oil is hot enough"
4,Better than most,"We had a problem with this fryer; we used it for a year and then after being carefully cleaned the last time we fried french fries, it stopped working. Well, until today, it is almost 6 or 8 months we didn't use it, today my wife tried to plugg it again and noticed that the prongs of the magnetic plug were lightly sticky and greasy, and the magnetic receiver also was kind of greasy. She cleaned them with a small piece of paper towell soaked in dishwashing soap, plugged it in, and ""voila"" the light turned on...the bad news is that we already had bought another counter top electric fryer from a comercial store. Now we have two!"
2,Why is this a favorite?,The lid is hard to seat right & is not hinged so you're stuck trying to figure out where to put this hot oily lid. It is somehow very good at filtering the odor though & does a nice job cooking/crisping
3,not so hot,"Yes, not so hot. That's what I meant. It does not get as high as I would like to take some fats. The drain spigot is a nice idea but useless if your food has taken too long to brown.Disappointed. I want great fried shrimp (becuase I love the batter I invented) and perfect frenched fries.Sigh."
2,delonghi deep frier,CHEAP!!!! drain valve door won't stay closed!! magnetic cord keeps falling off!! you have to get the frier positioned just right to the electrical outlet or else the cord keeps falling off!!
1,Great till it dies 3 of 4 in dumpster,"I had a DeLonghi fryer with a rotating basket. Loved it. Electronics died and I couldn't find the same unit so I purchased a D14427DZ (same unit with digital temp control). Electronics died. Got another. Same fate. Got this unit. Thought great, the digital temp was replaced with analog. Problem solved. Wrong!!! It died too. On number 4 of this model. I have had other DeLonghi products and been happy, but 3 of 4 of this model died, and 1 other model died. If it would not die it would be a great product; however, not worth the agrivation. Hard to salvage a pot of warm fat laden fry's!!!!"
2,Too Big and Plug is in bad spot,"This unit definately has more than one flaw. Be aware that this is a pretty large appliance to have sitting on your counter. It is fairly deep for a home counter. Also, the electrical plug comes strait out of the back of the heating unit, so this increases the depth of the fryer. The other issue is the sensor on the heating unit where it attaches to the oil pan. As stated in the other comments, if this is not seated properly, the unit shuts off. So if you don't have LOTS of depth on your counter, the electrical plug bumps into the wall, and unseats the heating unit just slightly and the fryer shuts off. This happens ALOT. The unit is very easy to clean though."
4,So far So Good.,"I've read some bad reviews for this deep-fryer, but only durability issues: broken spigot door, weak/flimsy heater mounts, etc.Temperature consistency is good, thermal recovery is good, oil odor is nicely controlled by the lid. Oil drain spigot is a nice touch, making clean-up easier. Frying capacity is good for a counter-top deep-fryer. Thermostat control markings are undervalued by about 5-10 degrees, according to my candy thermometer. But this unit is a nice replacement for my 10 year old Presto that recently died; we'll see if I get similar life out of this DeLonghi.In terms of basic design, it's very similar to others of it's size and capacity, and I would imagine it's durability issues are similar as well. Unless you're using multiple units professionally (as I've read elsewhere) where the fryer won't get the care it would at home.I would recommend this version with the drain spigot, a few bucks more, but worth it for the ease in clean-up."
3,Shouldnt have bought based on reviews,"Online this looked like a heavy duty large fryer with great reviews. Was disappointed right out the box, the stainless steel trim on the heating unit kept falling off so we finally left it off. The magnetic connection for the plug is very touchy so you have to have it perfectly positioned to heat up. Once a steady connection was made the unit did heat quickly and cooked the food (french fries) satisfactoraly, however a stinky oil frying smell hung in the air for days. Our last fryer was a Delonghi cool touch with the lock lid and filter- wish I gotten that again instead. Cant really return this item once used, too bad."
2,De Longhi Deep Fryer,"I purchased this fryer a little over a year ago, and was pleased with its performance. It was easy to clean both inside and out. Went to cook lemon chicken tonight, and all I get is err. Will cost more than its worth to get it fixed. Looks to me like this is one of those products that will get you just past warranty. Wouldnt buy another one!"
3,Beware of sharp edges,"Works great and got plenty hot. However, the edges of the oil vat and the housing are quite sharp. Ouch."
3,Three's company,"I must admit that the beginning of this third work in the series had me worried that Mr Lindsay might have lost his momentum. Fortunately, once the main setting was reached, it picked up and continued on the fantastic pace set by the first two works. The return of many favored characters is enhanced by the introduction of the new antagonists and the counter culture themes add a bit of spice to the Loaferville populace. This new element refreshes the storylines of the characters in an intriguing, yet naughty sort of way. While not my favorite of the three works by Chris Lindsay that I've read, I have still enjoyed this work immensely, each time that I've read it."
3,Comedy for a change of pace.,"James Gardner makes this sporadic paced comedy putter along. It does have some good lines and pranks if you can stay awake with the dead fill time. Average compared to the ""Support the ****"" movies."
4,Pleasant but not outstanding,"As a twenty-something, I really don't know much about John or Robert Kennedy other than the vague ""Camelot"" fantasies tossed around. I acquired this book as part of my recent appetite for understanding JFK/RFK.I found it to be a light-weight overview of the major periods of JFK's life, along with some information on RFK and Jackie. While it revealed a few new things I hadn't heard before, this book is really of interest primarily as a coffee table book for ocassional perusal, and not for study. It's a great combination of stories you will have heard and pictures you have already seen.The accompanying CD, however, is particularly interesting in what it reveals about JFK the man and his way of being. Overall, I enjoyed it."
5,The Most Complete & Accurate on JFK,"This book is the most complete and accurate book on President John F. Kennedy. With the contribution from the John F. Kennedy Library & Museum, the true and exact data regarding the man who changed the life of many Americans is shown here in a direct manner. Great pictures. In conclusion, this book deserves to be at each home in the USA and abroad. JFK is worth to be known and admired through this masterpiece. This book is a must."
4,Mainly for die-hard Rick fans,"Count me in as one of the die-hards. I enjoyed this collection but from a quality perspective the majority of these tracks are not close to his best works. I'm not a fan of multi-vocal tracking and several of the tracks are in this vein. Rick had a good voice and this type of production simply clouds his vocals. Of special note are selections like ""I Need You"", a smooth ballad, and ""California Free"", a country-rock piece, both of which showcase Nelson's talents.I'm a big fan of liner notes and the included 26 page booklet is almost worth the price of admission; chocked full of great information and with the back page featuring a color fan photo of Rick and his beautiful wife Kristin. Seemingly a match made in heaven; or so we thought."
5,A survey of 20+ linked tools for environmental management,"TOOLS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: A PRACTICAL INTRODUCTION AND GUIDE is a recommended college-level pick for any collection strong in environmental issues or environmental management. It provides a review of the Environmental Management Systems as a whole, surveying over twenty linked tools ranging from product and technology assessment and economics to purchasing guidelines and human factors. While billed as a 'primer', it's anything but an easy introduction: college-level audiences already involved in environmental management courses will find it a weighty but invaluable survey."
5,Superb!,"I heard the song ""Moonshine"" on a folk station (on the internet!) and on the strength of that 1 fine song bought this collection. I was very impressed with the quality of songwriting and the inspired covers by these artists. It clearly was a labor of love for them."
4,a yardstick in directing,"Ugetsu is one of the most fascinating films of the Japanese Cinema and at the same time a world masterpiece.Kenji Mizoguchi created a yardstick in directing and capturing the very essence of the characters in a unique way.The way the camera was keeping a distance and yet revealing the characters is fascinating.The story is classic and the characters can appear in every era the world round.Men obsessed by their determination to prove themselves is a common theme that became the center action of thousands of films.Yet Mizoguchi presented this classic theme in a spectacular way.If someone wants to study and enjoy the Japanese cinema, he/ she should start by this film and then move slowly and with a lot of attention and care to such masterpieces as Rashomon, Ikiru by Kurosawa, Sisters of Gion, Street of Shame, Life of Oharu by Mizoguchi, and only then to enjoy films such as Tampopo, The funeral , Taxing woman of Itami ."
3,"Good, but not Great","Ugetsu is certainly a classic piece of Japanese film but to say it's ""one of the best films of all time"" goes too far.Ugetsu does two things: it portrays the plight of the peasantry and tells a ghost story. The problem is that the two halves of the film don't congeal into much of a message or statement. A bunch of stuff happens in Ugetsu but on the whole it's not as complete a work as the better Kurosawa films.The Criterion edition has a marvelous transfer, but the film has not aged all that well. The relatively modest special effects and camera work often make it seem like you're watching a play, rather than a film-- a character flicks on a match and the room becomes illuminated, obviously by lightbulbs. Parts of the river sequence are too obviously shot in a studio. The ghost woman looks less like a ghost than a woman in white makeup.Again, Ugetsu is a good film of its time, and definitely worth a watch, but let's not over-praise it just because of its age."
5,Gentle Comedy Scores a Touchdown!,"Charlton Heston is generally thought of as the hero of epic-style films. But in this family-style comedy, filmed after The Ten Commandents and before Ben-Hur, he proves he has comedy chops. As a hard-driving Army major, he is ""punished"" by being sent to work at a boy's milatary school. Perhaps unique to the times, the love interest of this film is not, as Major Benson first supposes, a nurse . . . but a full-fledged doctor, beautifully played by Julie Adams. A trove of child actors from that period, plus wonderful William Demarest and quite a few other recognizable familiar faces (including a very young David Jansen, in the first few minutes) round out the cast. A good script and delightful theme song (used also for another Tim Hovey movie, Toy Tiger) make this a very enjoyable experience."
5,One of Charlton's best!,"My only copy of this movie is off the TV, so I was thrilled to find it on VHS. Probably Charlton Heston's only out-and-out comedy (does ""Mountain Men"" count?) I loved him in the epic films, but I wish he'd done more like this as well! When will this be on DVD?!!"
5,The war is over...let the humor begin,This is a fine old movie. Tim Hovey is the one who really makes this movie work. They just don't make films like this any more.
3,Major BENSON W. Payne,I give this 3 stars because I'm under 50 years of age and foolishly thought it might live up to its Wayan brother remake. As a die hard Major Benson Winifred Payne fan I thought this movie was worth a lone watch just to complete my degree in all things Major Payne. Not worth paying money for if you're on the fence. You know who you are.
1,Brass coating comes off,"Once we started putting soap on this, the brass coating started to disappear, leaving just the plain silver metal underneath. We didn't expect five star quality, but that was really disappointing."
5,Its all in the name!,"In what appears to be the first and only book ever by a Mottern, this dispels, in convincing fashion, that ugly stereotype that we can't reed or right"
4,Lynch By Inch,When I first baught this CD I was disapointed with it mainly because of the production but it's grown on me and i'm lovin it now. I'm still not feelin a lot of the beats but for the most part Lynch came [right] on the lyrics and song concepts if you a Lynch/Siccmade fan you need to swoop this up. . .
1,garbage,"I hate to give such a low rating but lynchs other albums 24 deep,loaded and season of the sicc were some of the best albums in rap history.The first couple of songs are good but then it just gets worse and worse.I bought this album on reserve before it even came out and was so excited to pick it up.Big letdown.Besides siccmade rituals by cos this is one of siccmades worse albums.Unless you are buying for your lynch collection stay away."
5,Great Product,"I bought this for my son, he has wanted it for a long time and he is very happy with it so I give it a great review."
3,Not bad,"Ok I saw the one star reviews.. don't hate folks. it's not that bad at all.. sure it's not EBK4 or season of da siccness but it's still a damn good one. Other than the spiderman song, man he must've been hittin some sherm or something, that one is funny and seems way outta place on a Lynch CD, but hey.. that one song is probably the only reason I give this 3 stars instead of 4, other than that, this is a good CD, don't be skurred to picc it up, don't listen to the haters. Lynch is lynch, if you like most of his stuff, you'll like this one too. Disc 2 is pretty deep."
1,what the hell,this album sux Lynch is not the Lynch I knew and was into this is almost popish sounding and very mainstream I just can't into it a waste of money so be warned.
2,this aint the brotha lynch ive heard,"all though no albums have matched up to season of the sick this is truly the worst one ive heard yet and i have every brotha lynch album,but if you need it to complete your collection then go ahead but you will probably be disappointed"
2,WORST ALBUM EVER,"Brotha Lynch Hung is one of the greatest rappers of all time, except this album sucks the biggest egg yet. Nothing will ever compare to ""Season of the Siccness"" dont even try and compare. This album is weak from start to finish. I was sick of it half way through the first disc, but i forced my self to listen to both cd's and it never got any better. Lynch, if your out there, what happened ?!$#@$@%@^%#! (it onlt gets 2 starts because its Lynch, if it was anybody else it would get 0 starts)."
5,King of the West,"Got daamn, aye all i got to say is this album is beyond off da hook. To me, this is his best cd so far, you may think differently, but thats beside the point. if you're a hardcore lynch fan like me, this is that one cd you need in your collection. Those of you that have never heard of brotha lynch, peep this cd out."
3,"Great history, well referenced, poorly written","I was looking for a light history read on this era and I found it. I also learned that even I could write a book. Much of ""Envy of the Gods"" is repetetive and I kept getting the feeling that the author was trying to stretch 50 pages of information into 200 pages of text. This was unfortunate, as the extensive references suggest that there was a lot more useful information to be had."
2,Get on with it already,"Before reading this book I was hoping to find a fresh take on the life of Alexander the Great and in this pursuit I was not disappointed. The style, however, made trudging through this book one of the most frustrating reading experiences I have had. Many things are unnecessarily repeated and I found myself saying, ""just get on with it already."" This book contained some good content but it was stretched far beyond what it was capable of. Overall, there are some fresh ideas presented but they are rarely backed up with historical evidence. This is probably not the book you are hoping for."
4,The Visual J++ 6.0 reference,I think that this reference is the complete and the best one for Visual J++ 6.0 so far. The best subject in the reference is DHTML.
2,Purchased CD,"The CD itself was in good shape and I received the item as described. HOWEVER, in the future, I suggest that the seller CLEAN the cd case. It was disgusting and had stains on it."
3,www.sialis.org,"I highly recommend educating yourself with this website or The Bluebird Monitor's Guide from Cornell before buying a bluebird box. This box is one option, with which I am currently having success. But there are lots of other choices, some also made by Coveside and available on amazon. I have a family of bluebirds doing well and about ready to fledge in my box. But I made quite a few mistakes before learning the ropes and would do it differently if I had it to do over again. I previously rated this three stars due to the difficulty mounting it to a tree, only to learn that a tree is not the best place to mount a bluebird box (too accessible to predators). There are also quite a few independent ""garage"" manufacturers of bluebird houses out there who make great boxes, and it's fun to try different styles. The website I reference has links to those builders, and a wealth of information on how to attract and take care of bluebirds and other cavity nesters (like tree swallows)."
2,House Sparrows love it,"I have had the box for 2 years now. Nice box, but the house sparrows go back to it time and time again. I remove the nest materials while they build and they build again. I made the box more shallow with the block of wood given. I also removed the perch. It doesn't matter. The sparrows call it home."
1,sparrow resistant bluebird house,The day I put up the bird house a sparrow moved in. This bird house (rather expensive) does no better job of keeping out sparrows than your ordinary and cheaper bluebird house. Don't bother.
1,Simply Awful Stuff,"First of all it gets so hard you need a chisel.Second it IS bitter.Third it does NOT taste sweeter than sugar.One gal said she either doesnm't know or is a liar. I heaqrd her on a show saying that she takes thousand of mgs of Melatonin, impossible,(they come in 3mg capsules and 1000 would mean taking an entire bottle) that should have been my warning this lady does not know shat she is talking about.This is a cancer causing agent, my problem was believing she was not a liar or at the very least not informed.I tried to give a review on her site and oh my, she never allowed my negative review just the 4 star ones.Shame on Suzanne Somers: what some people won't do for a buck.I think giving me cancer causing elements is stooping pretty low.eat sugar at least you know where it comes form, most of the time."
3,Very Sweet!,"Suzanne Somers has done a good job making a very sweet product. I found that it, like most artificial sweetners, has an after taste and I wasn't too thrilled about it. I discovered Stevia which is a natural product and use it exclusively now. Thanks for trying Suzanne."
1,bad taste,"The SomerSweet had a bad taste when I used it in my coffee. If you don't like artificial sweetener and the horrible aftertaste associated with it, you may not like SomerSweet either. I found that it can be used to reduce the sugar content of a recipe. I tried it in a smoothie with yogart, fruit and sugar syrup. This tasted good."
3,Kind of obvious,"We bought two of this type of safe at the same time. One was Desonex, and the other was the hairspray. The Desonex safe comes with a type of foam padding inside, and as a result, if you shake the can, you cannot tell that there are items inside. The Aqua Net can, on the other hand, has no type of padding, so as soon as you shake it, you can hear the items inside rattle around. It will serve our purposes, but it's not going to fool anyone."
1,Waste of money,"Once you take the bottom off you can not put it back on. Useless and stupid. It's glued at the bottom, what am I supposed to do crazy glue it every time I put something in it."
5,Fantastic idea!,"Blends seamlessly on my dresser with the candles and other hairspray products.Goes completely unnoticed!I like that alot!Depending on what I put in there,meds (small bottle) or cash...use a sock to keep things from rattling around.My sister even picked it up and tried to use it,nothing came out and she grabed the next handiest bottle..lol...keep your eye on it so it doesen't get thrown away...exelent product and fast shiping."
4,All in one...,"I had never seen soul man but just having Heathers and Girls Just Want to Have Fun in one package was enough for me, once you see all three you realized this is worth it!"
2,Shallow overview,"O'Ballance's book reads like a very long newspaper account. Heavy on ""who"" ""what"" and ""when"", this text never offers the reader any explanation of ""why"" anything has happened in the Sudan. The civil war in the Sudan is a result of a number of forces, not the least of which are colonial rule, economic strains, and ethnic and religious tensions. O'Ballance's book does justice to none of these factors. Historians often get annoyed with journalists because they don't take history into account. This book is a prime example of that failing."
3,Disappointed that book omits important areas,"I read all the reviews and thought this book would provide a good reference on Swing. While it does introduce developers to Swing, I've subsequently found that it glosses over or fails to cover topics that are important once you start developing with Swing.For example, the book barely touches on layout managers. But an understanding of layout managers is essential to development of a good UI via Swing. The book also has no/minimal coverage of areas such as text selection and carets. I suspect that there are other areas not mentioned but I haven't proceeded far enough with Swing to recognize what else is missing.With hindsight, I wish that I'd bought the Java Swing book published by O'Reilly."
5,Delivers what it promises!,"I'm an experienced Window GUI programmer who switched to Java couple of weeks ago. Within a week, this book really guide me ""up to speed"" to swing as it promises. In real world, you want to absorb core concept & examples as soon as possible and pick up real stuff while coding based on them. I couldn't find any significant ""neat"" tricks from ""Core JFC""(which is thick enough to please some people) and this is not a ref anyway. Org & examples are neat and Guts knows how to get to the point without wasting your time. One of the best considering the current status of swing itself."
4,Out of date but I think its the best swing introductory book,I have other swing books but this was the first one out and it is the best book at keeping you in tune with gui development. The other books I have are great once you spend tons of time with them but are so detail oriented that its frustrating. This book was good when I needed to learn and its also good to look at because it has user interface design tips. I think interface design is also an art and shouldnt be treated as such a science. This book gives good suggestions at how to make the interface nicer for average users. The only complaint I have is that it is out of date for JDK1.2 but since another edition is coming out I will buy that one.
3,Good Book for beginners.,This is really a good book for those who want to start doing programming with Swing Components. I will highly recommend it for the beginners.
2,Good UI Guidlines. Bad Swing Book.,The hints on user interface design were helpful and concise. A better (but not great) UI design book is Interface Design by Peter Bickford (ISBN 0-12-095860-0). The code examples and API explaination were shallow at best.
1,"Too wordy, example doesn't work.","This book spends almost one page explaining what the constants HORIZONTAL_SCROLLBAR_AS_NEEDED and the like means, which anyone can guess just by reading out the words. An example concerning how to programmatically scroll a JScrollPane doesn't work, I wonder if the author has tested it before publishing. I consider the two minutes or so time that I spent reading that book wasted."
1,Quite an _overview_,"I've been working with Java for about a month, and bought this book to help with some more difficult and specific problems. This book didn't help me at all. This book doesn't get to the nitty-gritty that I needed. The examples are poor. Everything is presented very quickly, which might be for someone who is interested in Swing, but isn't expected to develop with it!"
2,"Fair, but rushed, effort","The author should be commended for penetrating the dense, and at times insufficient, Swing documentation to generate some useful examples. Even so, far too many important issues are glossed over and there are many, many typos. Overall, a very rushed job.The author is definately a hold over from the AWT coding days; his applications tend to subclass JFrame (a now unecessary habit) and he avoids all use of inner classes without any explanation of their pros or cons.The chapters build, in a rather unpredictable manner, towards the more complex examples, which mix JTree and JTable together.On the flip side, the book is very effective at uses screen grabs and illustrations to demonstrate ideas (a weakness in other books, notably Eckel's ""Thinking in Java"").In the final consideration, I seem to be liking this book less as I refer to it more and more. I'll choose my next book on JFC/Swing more carefully."
2,content pretty thin,"Overall, not the detailed content that I really needed to develop a major app. Chapters on the Tree and Table classes are the longest, but I haven't had to use them yet. Plenty of more useful info available from the JDC and the Swing page."
1,Ernest Hemmingway famous author series,"I got this movie to show to my eight grade students but the music was so corny and the biography was so brief that I didn't show it. A much better biography is the A&E ""Ernest Hemingway- Wrestling with life."
1,BADLY out of date,"Decent book in 2003, dirt poor book now. Too bad the authors don't support it with an update. The Medicine version is pure gold, but it took them about three versions to get there.This looks and feels like version 1.0 (or even a Beta). Don't waste your money. Errors, poor organization, cheap quality, lack of tables and graphs and now dangerously out of date with current standard of care."
1,Utter disappointment... =(,"I was so excited and looking forward to my Pocket Emergency Medicine 2011 2nd edition. I own the Pocket Medicine 4th Ed, the green one, and it is pure gold. I was excpecting a similar quality from this one, being from the same series and all. When i got it i saw so much blank space in the pages, so little information, and SO LITTLE REFERENCING... Not worth it. I am deeply disappointed. I am referring to the 2010-2011 version, 2ed."
1,Disappointed,I am a big fan of Pocket Medicine and was disappointed by this book. There is a big lack of references and it is badly out of date. I prefer 5 Minute Clinical Consult on the iphone to this book.
2,not enough info on anything,"so this was a big let down for me, this book looked like another book for internal medicine (the green one).. (i dont want to put any names on this review) but anyways, its not nearly as good as the internal med book that this book was made to imitate. It has a lot of different diseases, however they all fall short. they could have put sooooo much more info in this book. It lacks everything from clinical presentation to pathophys to management... this is dead weight in my white coat"
1,no good Pyle Sterio,"Purchased this radio on April 10 2012,received it on or about April the 18th.Installed it the next day and it played great except,if the key was turned off and then turned right back on the radio would not turn on until the reset button was pushed,which was aggravating,but not worth taking it out.But on July 12th.i backed the car out of the garage shut it off went back in the house,when i came back out and started the car,no radio,so i pushed the reset button but nothing.it was dead,so i removed the radio after checking the fuses to see if a wire was broken.no broken wire,everything was as it should be but the radio was dead,no power,still no power,so i reinstalled my old radio which works fine.So take my advice if you are thinking of buying a new radio for your ride DO NOT buy a PYLE.they are junk.this page will not let me finish until i rate the item so i gave it one star but i would not have given it any if this would have finished without it."
2,not fresh,"Like most ""slang"" dictionaries, this one was out-of-date before it hit the presses. Hip-hop terminology evolves quickly, so many of the newer definitions for terms like ""tripping"" and ""fronted"" are not included. So unfortunately, this is more of a historical document."
2,Hip Hoptionary,"This is a great reference book. It's format is friendly to the eye and shows some ceativity on the part of itis contributors. Off the ropes and awful dope, so go copp that thang youngin!"
3,Fresh is better,The Nature's Way Parsley Leaf capsules were okay. I prefer using the fresh leaves over these. Really didn't notice much of a difference in water weight.
2,Misleading picture,"This prism was significantly more expensive that the least expensive but is listed as having a book that goes with it. The book is actually about 2 inches wide and 4 inches long and contains so little that its hard to believe anyone could list it as a ""fun and informative guide book"".Pass on this one."
3,definitely safe hard to break for schoolkids,"i could not get this to produce the rainbows with office lighting,led-type flashlights. i am going to try regular lilghtbulbs. it works with sunlight. i am not a science teacher so i do not know if a glass (breakable) prism would give me more light sources for the rainbow effects or if it has to have sunlight. They were still fun to watch the refracting angles it would send the light to, but i was trying to produce rainbows at a nighttime class. It es extremely tough and durable and cheap compared to the allglass ones though."
1,cheap chinese product,materiel is soft.....why?????b ware it scratched immediately sooo soft why even bother if n0ot to get the easy dollar b ware
1,Doesn't hold up well in dishwasher,"I was given a set of 12 when I was married 2 years ago. 3 have broken under normal wear and tear, and the color bands across the bottom have all but disappeared. Also, they are narrow enough that its hard to clean all the way to the bottom, especially if they've set out to long with milk in the bottom. They match the set nicely, but aren't made well enough for continuous use."
5,Beutiful Everyday Drinking Glasses!,"The blue-green tinted glass goes beautifully with the ocean breeze stoneware and is quite sturdy for everyday use. The bottoms are extra heavy, making the glasses very stable and difficult to knock over.I've had them for over a year, use them all the time, run them through the DW, and am completely satisfied!"
1,See also my review for the double old fashioned glasses.,"The glassware is very fragile, made of very thin glass. It is not really adequate for every day use. I would not recommend buying this product."
1,Extremely disappointing,"We got a full set of these beautiful glasses for our wedding. Within a month, one glass broke while I was hand-washing it. Soon, another broke, then another. The glass is very thin and fragile. Perhaps they hold up better in the dishwasher? Eventually, all but one of our glasses broke. We threw the last one away. The colors on the bands had begun to fade and we knew it was only a matter of time until the glass broke. We were sad these glasses didn't work out for us, because they were so lovely."
2,Beautiful but fragile,These glasses came free with matching dishes. They are beautiful but fragile and the color band at the bottom is gone. I would not recommend them for everyday use. I think we originally started with 12 and are now down to 8 in about 8 months.
5,good,"good product. good condition. came on time. i really appreciate the excellent service provided by the seller. i am very pleased when people have good, solid work ethics and handle their business positively.would definitely recommend."
1,Horrible,"This is a horrible text. It does a great job of describing when, where and various exceptions to rules. It gives great background on why. However it seriously lacks the what. It has hardly any descriptive or formatting information. It give various methods such as ""thick description"" and "" interview schedule"" without explaining what they are and how their formatted.Avoid this book."
3,nice service,"I got this book quickly, but wasnt happy about this quality in the first place. However, after contact w/ the book store, their attitude was good and they were willing to help me. I feel comfortable w/ their service."
3,"Not all that great, but something new","I did not think it was such a great book. I was wandering where is she going with this, what is her point. It is describing a woman struggling in society, trying to find her soul, something that makes her happy, and it would not be a good Dutch book if at least not some sex was involved. As I said, some parts are well written and makes this book an interesting read."
4,Like partying with dear old friends you've never met before,"If you like the Virgin/Some Bizarre ""caucasian funk"" era of CabVol, you're intimately familiar with these songs, but almost certainly not with most of the versions presented here. And yes, they are more than different enough to be engrossing and fun even if you've heard the albums a thousand times. It's also a nice best of from this era for the uninitiated or those familiar with the material but who only feel they need the ""singles"" of this era. In the absence of reissues of CODE and The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, this also forms a good stopgap.This is truly a multipurpose CabVol CD, and one even a casual fan will find delightful. It deserves a 4.5, but that option is not offered. Buy it and try not to pee yourself laughing when you hear the version of Don't Argue they included..."
1,THEY ARE NOT ANTIBACTERIAL!! False advertising!,"I am really mad that I wasted money on these thinking I'd be cleaning by ears better....as the item name and description suggest. They are intentionally misleading to sell more units. Antibacterial Q-Tips do not exist. This is the description, straight from the product website:Q-tips AntimicrobialOur Q-tips Antimicrobial cotton swabs are treated to keep swabs fresher, giving you peace of mind when cleaning minor cuts, scrapes, and applying ointments. ""They are treated so they stay fresh and don't expand like Q-tips. sometimes do once the box is opened. They are NOT antibacterial. The price is outrageous considering they do not do what the name says.....and I saw these at my local Walgreens today for $2.89. What a rip off."
1,Better Alternatives,"I used to use this glue. I hated it. Since I took up RC airplane building, I've been using cyanoacrylate or wood glue. The cyano dries quickly, and the bond is pretty strong. Wood glue is great, but doesn't make waterproof joints. Testor's wood glue is too thick and difficult to use."
5,GREAT GLUE FOR ARCHITECTURE WOOD MODELS,"This glue is my savior. Glued my architecture wood models in seconds, not minutes or even hours like white or tacky glue. THANK YOU"
2,MEH!,"White glue I think works better. While this is a strong bond, I have scruples against it. It held well, but it ripped apart the wood upon impact worse than I have ever seen white glue do."
2,Waste of Money,Did not reflect subject material for Biology 0235 exam accurately. Topics were also too general as well.My advice use a Bio.1 study guide rather than this book.
3,not quite as useful as advertised,"I just took the Praxis II for Physics and used this book's practice test to check my readiness. Though I was more or less ready for the test without much studying, the practice test questions were noticeably easier than the real questions. The practice test gives you a pretty good idea of the subject matter that will be tested. However, to answer the questions in the practice test you need only remember the general relationships between quantities, like 'goes as 1/r^2' to calculate the quantity. For the real exam you should have a firm grasp on the whole formula. I'm glad I had the book as it gave me some piece of mind, but for those that are easily rattled in a test situation, the detail required for the real exam could be quite a shock. For how much this study guide cost, I expected a more representative practice test. (One more reason I think ETS is a rip off.)"
2,Not much more than a list...,"I ordered this book to help me prepare for the Praxis II (Earth & Space Science). Because it's written by ETS, I thought it would be very helpful with lots of content for review. I was disappointed to find that it basically lists broad topics ""included"" on the Praxis II for each content area. There is only 1 practice test for each content area too. For the money you pay for this book, pick up another study guide instead."
2,Not a comprehensive prep book,Only use this book if you remember all formulas and fundamentals of subjects you studied while you were in high school. There are test questions for each subject you are interested in. For me question answers did not help untill I read some other books to refresh my basic fundamentals...
5,Good practice,"Biology: I found the practice biology test to be very helpful for taking the 0231 test. The one in the book was harder. My mouse button must have slipped as I meant to give it 4 stars instead of 5. The section on Study Topics was overwhelming, and suggests you should know ALLLL of the topics at great depth. The real test was nothing of the sort. What I did to study was to get the Cliffs Quick Review called Biology and just read it. The topics are exactly the same, and those explain the material adequately and in a little more depth than the test asks you to know it.General Science: My other gripe is that the general science practice test was not helpful for preparing me for 0435. It was only half the length and the questions were harder on the real test. The study topics were generally accurate, but I was completely unprepared for the vast barrage of weather-related questions the real test asked me."
2,This is a 'study guide' not a review book!,I purchased this thinking that I could use it to review the sciences. THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR REVIEWING THE SCIENCES! All it gives are topics that should be studied and practice tests for the various areas. I was disappointed. So instead I checked out a book called 'Chemistry the Easy Way' from the library and used it to review the chemistry material. That book was much better for reviewing the material and it had 5 practice tests that were a little more difficult than the Praxis. They also have the same books in the different science areas.
3,Not a good review,"Do not get this book if you are looking for a science review. It only provides an outline of topics covered on the test. However, it does include actual tests by the ETS so those are good for studying."
2,just a list,"The only good to this book is that it provides sample tests. Other than that, it only lists topics that could be covered on the Praxis test. It is also very general, so you cannot get a real feel for what could be on the test. I would not recommend it to study with."
1,no item received,"I didn't received my book even after a month. I contacted customer service twice. The second woman was nice and refunded my money while the original one refused to. I had sent several emails and continued to follow up on the product and no one knew where it was. It was shipped two days after I ordered it, supposedly. Finally, the nice customer rep that I did speak to indicated that I had a former address listed. I haven't ordered anything on Amazon except the last 3-4 months which I have lived at my for last 2 years. Not sure how they obtained my mother's address when I personally checked my account and as mentioned hadn't listed it."
4,"Beautiful image, dull color","If you love the beach of Naples, this painting will give you pleasure & peace. Color reproduction in this print is, unfortunately,dull. It's lovely nonetheless."
2,Old reprint--better information available,"This guidebook was written in 1981 for the state of Montana.This guide is interesting historically, but much more current information on geothermal energy development in Montana is available.Visit the Montana Department of Environmental Quality website for more current and up-to-date information on Montana geothermal development.Montana DEQ Geothermal Website[...]"
4,"ho ho, 100 words of pashto","The title is quite clear--this book will teach you 100 words/phrases of pashto. The games/puzzles/connect-the-words pages are on the one hand quite stupid but on the other hand serve as the repetition necessary to commit the words to memory. So far, my favorite word in Pashto is ""ghwaa"" (cow). I completed the book in 3 days. The editorial comment is wrong, Pashto is not spoken in Iran but is rather spoken in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan. A few words but not an overwhelming number are Farsi cognates (gul, pul, darwaazah, na, paak) and there are a few English/French cognates (talvezyoon, telefoon, hottel). The reader unfamiliar with the Arabic alphabet will find the book harder, and this book can serve as an introduction to the Pashto alphabet. (Arabic emphatic letters, th, dh, etc. are not used much)."
3,New language,"I am learning the basics of it. It's very interesting, to learn a new language and this is helping alot."
5,son in afghanistan,Great book would recomend if your kids are going to afghanistan and want to understand somewhat the dialogue
1,incomplete and grainy,"The video to DVD quality of this makes it look grainy, like it was patched together by somebody using a Dell computer from 1997.Also, the introductions to each performance are missing, and this lapse amounts to butchery when it comes to Jon Voight's Dylan intro...which is cut entirely."
2,boyd at his least interesting,"this, along with Stars and Bars, is Boyd's most tossed-off novel--but it's still Wm Boyd, the best British novelist living. the characters here are pallid and limp, the plot plodding, the ""reversals"" less than interesting. much much better to pick up The New Confessions or Brazzaville Beach--two of the most riveting novels written this century."
3,kinda new,The book is captivating -- like a mystery fiction. But can anyone suggest who in fact committed the murders?
4,"I enjoyed the book, with certain reservations.","BLUE AFTERNOON, by William Boyd, came up to my expectations. I enjoyed it, as I do all of Boyd's novels. I found the plot intriguing, and the facts were really well researched. The main character, Carriscant, was a surgeon. I did find the details of the operations he performed, became a little tedious and not to my taste. A book I would recommend to my friends."
5,just what I was expecting,If you love Archie Campbell you'll like this CD. I was always having to go on youtube to listen to him now I can just pop in the CD and enjoy.
1,Bad DVD quality?,"I've waited for this for almost a year since I first heard of it. FINALLY came in, and I can't play it??? I have a decent Sony Blu Ray player which plays other DVD's. Just checked. For some reason it will not even see either of these DVD's! VERY FRUSTRATED! I suspect the quality of manufacture as it seems cheap around the edges if you know what I mean. I will try it later at other peoples houses, but really.... Something so monumental and fantastic to be religated to shoddy workmanship? Send me a new usable movie I can share with friends which I planned on, or my statments stand. So very sorry as I am greatly disappointed... :("
5,Great debut album!,"I bought the album of Madasun as soon as it was released in our country simply because I love their song, ""Don't You Worry"", which I heard only thru MTV. I never regretted doing so because I found a lot of other good songs in it. I do think they stand out from the rest because they have a sound that's clearly their own. It's fresh, vibrant and has a ""Feel Good"" (I just love this song!) attitude to it. To me, they sound like a mixture of rock & pop (like mixing a bit of Heart w/ the Bangles).... a nice welcome sound for the new millenium."
5,Masters is an expert change agent,"She guides you through the confusion to understanding and beyond. Lot's of insightful ideas, perspectives and stories to move you from turmoil to triumph."
2,Overly Improvised,"Able to follow first three selections. After these, I was lost. Excellent sound recording - production. I can only recommend this album if you are a fan of pretty heavy improvised jazz interpretations."
4,The Loyal Opposition,"The master shows his metal.Daniel Patrick Moynihan shows that there was mature dissent during the Reagan years. Mature in that he took on the Reaganites on there own terms and avoided the simplistic ranting of those who saw no problem with the explosion of government during the 1970's.Moreover, this collection serves as an encyclopedia of political wit (see the Gridiron Club address), prophecy (i.e. triple digit deficits and the fall of the Soviet Union), and the function of government.Highly recommended for those seeking sophisticated agruments to demonstrate that ""Reaganism"" did not have a positive influence on this country."
5,"Amazing, a much less dark Evangelion","I was please to see this as a much less dark version of Neon Genesis Evangelion, while I enjoyed the over all story ark, it's brutal dark tones really put me off. this series explores much of what made Evangelion so interesting, but is but less brutal and more enjoyable to watch.The exploration of human relationships in the guise if how they can transform the world around us, is pretty standard, but I like the characters and that allows you to connect and there for take meaning.It my nt have quite the emotional impact as something like Cl'annad, but very few stories do.If you are not interested by the end of the second episode, skip the rest. if you cannot invest up front, it is not really worth continuing. However, if you do invest, the story is fascinating."
4,Hollywood's Maddest Doctor's,"An excellent biography of Lionel Atwill, George Zucco and Colin Clive. A mini-biorpgraphy of each in this one volume. A wonderful overview of their lives, warts and all. I highly recommend this book to fans of old black and white horror movies."
4,Pricey!,"I really like this product. I bought it for the projected image on the ceiling to help soothe my newborn to sleep, and that feature didn't disappoint. It's nice that you can focus the image to make it clear. The music is nice, and the little bee character makes my daughter laugh. I just wish it was half the price. Also, the straps are worthless! Just plan on making your own straps, because the ones that it comes with are junk. Thankfully, I just prop mine up on the dresser next to my daughter's bassinet."
1,Corroded,Bought this soother and the batteries were corroded - even the springs were corroded. How long is this sitting? Did it get wet in shipping? This makes me scared to put it by my baby.
1,Broken record,"We actually bought this toy resale, so after replacing the batteries after a few days, I didn't think much of it. But then only three days after that the toy started repeating the opening line like a broken record again. It was creepy, annoying and obviously, not soothing. I thought maybe, because I had purchased it resale, that it was just not working. However, after reading other reviews, I realize that it just ate through the batteries in only three days and that the broken record routine is what happens. I am shocked that three C-cell batteries only last three days. While it was soothing when it worked and my 6 month old son loved it, I can't afford to replace batteries that frequently so we have abandoned it."
2,"Ok, but loud","We really like that this soother has both the projector so the baby can look up and parts that move on the screen for her to watch. She really seems to enjoy it.The problems I have with it are as follows:1) After a couple weeks, it makes a horrendous squeek. I know I could probably find a tight screw, as another review pointed out, but honestly do not have time or patience for this2) Batteries run out VERY quickly. We have it on the lowest sound setting and batteries run out after only a couple weeks. My other daughter has a very similar toy and batteries last at least a month, but its more like 2-3 months. When the batteries run out, the music starts to skip. You can turn off the projector, and that fixes this problem, but that's the part my daughter likes the most.3) We have had problems with it not shutting off. This may be a function of low battery energy as well. I've noticed when the batteries run out, it doesn't function as it should."
3,comparison shop for this one,"Got this at walmart for $29.00, the listed price here is $99.00 (although it is from another dealer, not Amazon) - that is just ridiculous! The toy itself has been warmly received by my baby - the music sounds great and she is fascinated by the light show. Still this is NOT worth the $99.00 price it is listed for. Don't be ripped off!"
1,Not what is shown on picture!,The soothe and suprise nature light is not what is in the picture. I am very unhappy because I thought I was buying the crib toy that was shown in the picture. The one you actually receive has a big bee on it...you can find this one in stores everywhere.
2,Eats Batteries!!!,"We have had this toy for about 6 months and while we use it only at night/naptime it eats batteries like crazy. When the batteries are running low it repeats ""Its Lullaby time"" in a voice that sounds like it should be in a horror movie and then it squeaks and wont stop running until you remove the batteries.My son enjoys the music but the toy is not very interactive. There is one button to press that starts the music to whatever you as a parent have it set to. The projector on the ceiling is nice, but again it just repeats the same little bugs and bears over and over.As a Momma to 3 boys don't waste your money on this one, there are much better soothers on the market."
1,DON'T BUY....DANGEROUS!!!,"Do not buy this crib player. It does not attach to the crib well. Before I could get my 10 month old out of the crib after a nap, my three old was playing with it, and the straps failed. Luckily, my son started screaming for me and he was holding it on with his hands, otherwise it would have feel on the baby. This product is going back to Walmart today. I sure wish Leap Frog still made the Dreamscapes Soother, it is the BEST!!!"
2,Great product...poor manufacturing!!,I bought this for my 7 month old to replace his mobile and he loves it! My only problem is a horrible crank noise it makes when the wheel turns and the fact that it eats C batteries like caviar! I don't mind the battery part because he does play with it before falling asleep to the music and I can always tell when he wakes up because he turns it on. I like the different light selections and the projector and the different choices of music is great too. My 2 year old nephew and my 5 year old son both love to play with it and want their own.
2,Better if Quirks were fixed!,"Many reviews mention a loud noise, I am on my 2nd one and I have a 'clicking' noise. I bought this for my infant and absolutely love it. I love the flashing lights and that it projects on to the ceiling. The sensor in it is also great (didn't have any problems like some of the reviewers have). My first one broke after a few months and started this clicking where the light that projects on to the ceiling began flashing on and off. I figured it was garbage so I asked for another for Christmas. This one lasted minutes and the same thing happened. Very disappointed because I really like it!!"
4,This crib soother has withstood 2 babies!,"I bought the soother on clearance for my 1st baby when she was around 10 months. I needed to replace the mobile she had gotten her hands on and put in her mouth! It proved to be an excellent replacement, soothing when she was tired and entertaining when she wasn't. She very quickly firgured out how it worked and would frequently ""adjust"" the settings to her liking. This makes the battery drain pretty quickly. It's quite durable and is now being used for my second daughter 3 years later. I've never had any issue with it being unsafe or noisy. It can be a little annoying, but more so to adults than to children :)!"
3,"Nice music, but loud mechanics","I received this as a gift. I like the projector, the different settings, and all the music choices. The one thing I dislike is how loud the mechanics of this toys sound. When you turn it on, the little characters moved back and forth inside, I think that is where the majority of the noise is coming from. It is almost louder than the music itself and requires me to turn up the volume. Turning up the volume to cover the mechanical sounds really defeats the purpose of this item soothing my baby to sleep."
3,Sucks batteries dry fast!,"My daughter loves this thing. As mentioned the motor is a little noisy but it wasn't bad. It was sort of like ""white noise"". It's very cute, she loved the lights and especailly the music. The light show for the ceiling broke after 6 mo. I just kept it off anyway because with that on I was replacing batteries in just a week. I can't afford new C batteries (4) every week. When will they ever start designing things like this that plug in to the outlet???"
1,Terrible product - don't waste your money,"This is not a well made product. Good idea in theory - terrible execution. Motor is louder than the music. Definitely NOT a soother for my baby. We sent it back. Try Fisher-Price ""Ocean Wonders"" mobile with remote. Cute mobile and great ceiling light show."
4,The best crib toy,This is the 2nd V Tech nature Light toy we have purchased. My daughter learned at about 6 months to turn the toy on herself so it got worn down pretty quickly. It's great because she can just push a button and turn it on at anytime throughout the night. Alot of times she will wake up in the morning and lounge in her bed watching for awhile. She loves it.
4,Better than ocean wonders,"We recieved this as a gift after we already had the Ocean Wonders aquarium. I wasn't going to keep it at first, but I am glad I did. I like everything about this better than the Ocean Wonders - music, lights, motion. My daughter especially loves the projection on the ceiling."
1,Very Disappointed,"I love v-tech products. Most of my son's toys are v-tech. Unfortunately, I am very unhappy with this product. It is supposed to turn on when noise occurs in the room. It does NOT! Also, it would burn through batteries like they were candy. At least, we think it was a battery problem. The product didn't quit running, it would keep reiterating itself, like a broken record, instead of turning off or continuing the song. Changing the batteries fixed that be we changed them about once a week!Another thing to take note of is that I have a crib with thicker rails-about 4""wide and 3""thick. The straps do not fit around the crib and we had to zip tie it (a problem with had with other similar products).I think this price is wrong....I got it at Walmart for $25."
4,Misleading,"The KC light so far is decent, although the steel back seems a little thin. The actual size of the light face is 4in. tall 6.5in. wide, and the light is 2.5in. deep, from the bottom of the light to the mounting plate where it bolts on is 1in. The misleading part is the desription says ""Features a pre-terminated wiring harness with an illuminated switch"" it has pre installed connections on the lead wires only, and there IS NO ILLUMINATED SWITCH. This is NOT a light kit, it is a single light only."
4,Ok book for beginners,"This book is short, yet covers all the basics of creating incense. One of the things i don't like is that the authors recommend using salt peter in self burning insense. Salt peter is a known toxin, and according to other sources wood charcoal or makko can be used in place. However aside from that it can be a decent starting point. A more indepth book and one that doesn't include salt peter is Incense by Carl F. Neal."
4,Great info!,Very informative and step by step. All the materials listed are realistically common and can be purchased almost anywhere.
5,"A Powerful Vision of American Dreams, Asian or Not","We had the good fortune to have Ms. Zia come speak in our community as part of her tour for this book. I was particularly struck at this event by her realistic assessment of where Asian America comes from, has been, and is going. This vision is reflected in this wonderful book. ""Asian American Dreams"" looks at both the diversity within Asian America, and at the problematic place of Asians and Asian Americans in our bipolar (typically Black/White) racial dialogue. Ms. Zia begins each chapter with an anecdotal essay which allows us to glimpse her good humor, and for those of us raised outside of traditional Asian America, to see similarities with our own experiences that we hadn't thought to look for in the past. I highly recommend this book for everyone with an interest in ""American"" culture, society and racial/ethnic dialogue."
5,Intriguing perspective into Asian Americans' lives,"I came across this book because I was writing a final paper for a Rhetoric class and had to write on the subject of interracial marriage. As an American-born Asian and second generation, I took the stand for pro-interratial marriage and relationships. However while reading this book, I learned a lot of key events that have occurred in the United States over the last couple decades that helped me understand more deeply about why my parents are so traditional while my aunts and uncles in South Korea are so modern, and why they are so protective all the time. Major themes in the book were youth being in limbo trying to identify with a new culture vs. holding on to an old one. What Helen Zia says we should all be doing is sharing all cultures. We don't have to lose one to gain one. We can be part of all types of cultures fully and wholesomely. : )"
5,This is absolutely great,"I'm a casual classical music listener and don't play the cello, so I won't involve myself in the debate over which of the various recordings of these pieces is definitive. I will say that if you don't find this music moving and achingly beautiful, you are dead inside, at least as far as music is concerned. I highly recommend this recording."
5,Great Interpretation of Bach,"I am new to classical music. My brother plays the cello and recommended this CD by Fournier. It is, simply, very good."
3,BORING BACH!,"Pierre Fournier's own interpretation of the unaccompanied cello suites really put me to sleep. Okay, he may be one of the greatest cellists in this generation, but I could care less about this album. Mr. Fournier plays everything slurred, legato, and very metronomic with little or no dynamic contrast. He literally kills the whole idea behind the Bach suites. If you're looking for a more Baroque approach to the unacccompanied suites, don't bother purchasing this album."
2,To be avoided,"There is indeed something wrong with the Gigue of the Sixth Suite, as with every other movement in every other Suite on this recording. But the culprit lies in Fournier's performance, which sounds rather uninteresting and somewhat detatched. This album leaves ""the world as it should be,"" preserving the status quo and offering nothing terribly new or interesting."
2,Decidedly Average,"There are truckloads of recordings when it comes to these Cello Suites, as the earlier reviews make clear. This album represents sort of a middle-of-the-road performance in relation to the other available options. It is neither terribly good nor terribly bad in terms of technique or musical concept; even the price of the CD places it in the middle of the spectrum. Spend a little time listening to musical samples from other recordings of this work, because you are likely to find cheaper and/or more compelling alternatives."
1,What is this?,"This is a completly messed version of the suites. I absolutely hate it. The playing is so stiff, it's hard to listen to. The quality is terrible, and I have never listened to this kind of recording of the suites before. There are notes that are wrong, and the playing does not sound professional at all. I recommend that you buy Rostropovich's suites, Yo-Yo-Ma's, or Cascal's. Those are much better than this recording."
5,Sublime,There aren't words to describe how beautiful these recordings are. The virtuosity of Fournier coupled with the majesty of Bach's suites are transformative and not to missed.
5,in true baroque spirit,"This is in my opinion one of the absolutely best recordings of Bach's cello suites, and to put this in perspective I am comparing to Casals and Yo-Yo Ma. Fournier has the technical mastery to find every hidden depth in these pieces, and to me this is the most truely baroque interpretation. For a recording that was made forty years ago the sound quality is very good, not surpring, though, since it is a DGG recording."
5,Purely Amazing,"I received the CD's yesterday & have been listening to them nealy all the time. The phrasing, intonation, tempo & sound are all first rate. This is peerless music making, far superior to Starker & even Casals. Very highly recommended."
1,Pool quality - Poor shopping experience,"Bought this item from handhelditmes (IGG factory) directly, not through Amazon. Shipping is slow, product arrived is phyically broken.I shipped back for a replacement. The replacement they shipped me is also defective, so I shipped it back for a full refund. They only refunded less than 50% of my total purchase price, despite their 100% customer satisfaction policy, and they couldn't explain how they come up with the refund amount. I can't rate this product but it seems like the product quality is very poor."
1,Not a good experience,"I purchased the mini dragonfly helicopter for my husband on the 5th of December. We did not receive the product until the beginning of January. When we finally got it, the helicopter was defective and would not even turn on. It's March now and I'm still battling with the company to get a refund or a replacement. They have so many hoops for you to jump through and often don't provide the information they require you to include for your return. I have not had a good experience with this company and would never do business with them again. I wish I had taken to heart the first person's review, then I wouldn't have to deal with this mess."
5,The best astrological Daily Guide,"I have used many different astrological guides through the years, but have found none better than Dr. Turi's Moon Power books. It's even better than Llewellen's moon guide. He covers each day of the year and describes the energies of that day according to work, partnerships, travel, environment, etc. It's really interesting to read the ""forecast"" and then watch what happens in the world. I am surprised at how accurate it is. He says because it is closest to the earth. it is the moon that affects us more than any planet. He has a few articles and commentary along the way, and also gives some examples of the kinds of things that have happened with the same energies, in the past."
1,Horrible organization,"I bought this book for my Intro to Comparative Politics class and was utterly disappointed. Not only is the language totally dumbed down and completely bias, but the overall organization of the book will give you a headache! Good luck if this is required reading!!"
3,OK collection,"well, i got this set about 2 weeks ago in the store. i hadnt watched creepshow or children of the corn in awhile so i figured i would get it. the creepshow dvd is pretty cool and is worth the money and the children of the corn isnt a great movie but its a classic and is one of those movies that isnt really scary but theres somthing about it that just makes it unique and a classic. the only scary part in that movie is when the people in the diner get posioned and another part from the diner im not gona say here in case you havnt seen it yet but the last dvd (( maximum overdrive)) .... the machines and trucks go haywire and attack the people by some unknown unseen force or somthing. the concept is good and the story but the acting and the movie is .... if your a hardcore stephen king fan get this collection or just get the 8 dvd collection from stephen king or buy only one disc, id skip this if your not really a huge stephen king fan but its a ok compilation."
3,New Maps DVD Doesn't work,"I bought the Magellan 3000t about 8 months ago and use it a fair amount with good results. When I saw new maps being released I ordered them via the Magellan Web Site. I received the DVD in 2 days and I expected to be wowed. I was but not the way you expect.I loaded the DVD and entered the security code provided and it tells me I have a bad code!I called tech support and got a promise of a call back within 48 hours. That was a month ago! I have called back several times and finally someone gave me a new code, same result! Email got me a notice saying call tech support. I finally got an email saying they are having issues and will send out replacements once they figure out how to fix the problem!This is my 3rd Magellan but will be my last I can't stand the non English speaking support staff and non responsive email support."
2,Not worth what we paid...,"My wife and I have had the Magellan 3000T for over a year now. At first, we loved this device and it saved us a lot of trouble with poor directions. Since ""upgrading"" to the latest version of software, the device has been much less consistent. There are times when the device will not update the miles to the next action (turn, etc) for long periods of time. It is not a poor GPS signal or anything else as the map still updates. We just missed a turn when not paying close attension as it went from 10 miles to ""turn right"". This cost us 20 minutes in rerouting. Additionally, we had expected to receive a map update in August. The date was pushed back multiple times, then published and quickly removed due to ""technical issues with several customers"". Now they have posted the map at a cost of $80. I think I'm going to spend an extra $50 and get a new device instead."
1,Stay away from Magellan Products,"Stay away from this GPS (and Magellan products as a whole) for the following reasons:1) The GUI is confusing; the screen where you type in the address of where you want to go is extremely hard to find. Amazingly, its not one of the actual buttons on the unit.2) This company was notified of problems registering serial numbers (for firmware updates and map updates) over a year ago and the same problem persists. From what I have read, other people have had a nightmare of a time with their support resolving the issue; I didnt bother.3) Update maps are almost $70, which is almost the cost of the entire bulky, oversized unit now."
2,I've used better.,"We use this unit at work, and I take it around the country. When it works, it's right on. However, it takes some getting used to.The menus are not intuitive. The power on/off/powersave function is awkward. Sometimes system locks and you have to restart the system. Previous destinations buried under ""Address Book.""I'd look elsewhere."
2,They charge for updates,"When I first received this product, many maps were already out-of-date. Magellan makes updates that are supposed to fix both the bugs in their original software and to add more maps. Usually, when you have some sort of product that relies upon software, normal updates are free, for example, Windows Service Packs 1 and 2. However, despite how much Magellan charges for this product, they also charge for updates. This is particularly unfair since the updates, according to the Magellan web site, fix bugs in the original program. I would have to pay $ 80.00 for an update. I'm not going to pay it. When the maps finally get too out-of-date, I will buy another GPS device from a manufacturer that provides their updates without charge. Garmin doesn't charge for updates. I haven't checked anywhere else yet. Despite the lack of updates, the Magellan works reasonably well."
3,Probably not the best out there,"I have ZERO sense of direction so this has served it's purpose. It does have a bit of a delay when missing a turn and needed to recalculate. If your car is parked in a parking garage and then you pull out and want to use it right away...it has worked for me...I have to drive around for a few minutes before it picks up signal. Other then that the colors are great, it's easy to learn, great volume. I'm sure there are other Nav systems way better but I'll keep this one and use it."
5,RoadMate 3000T,"This is my first GPS, but I don't know how I lived without it for so long!! The price is right, and it has NEVER been wrong on an address. I use it constantly, and it has never frozen up, been sluggish, or had any other problems. Take the time to read the instructions, and you will have no problems. Maybe those who left bad reviews are just brain-dead. I'm definately not tech-oriented, but the 3000T is a breeze to use. I'm 100% satisfied, and I think you will be too. I hope this makes your choice easier, and enjoy !!"
3,Design is bulky and cumbersom,I waited and waited until the new one came out.. i got it on a monday and returned it the follwoing day.It was larger than the 800 series and locked up a couple time in one day. I will wait until the next design comes out.. Dont know when. Or I will take a closer look at the Garmin Nuvi.Also this one still does not let you download travel info to your PC.. Why can the nice ones for the car not download way points?? I cannot find one that does.I would but the 800 or 860 over this model
5,Incorrect Product Information,"I purchased this item because I am a U.S. Soldier stationed in Germany and the product diescription stated that it came pre-loaded with maps of the US, Canada, and the Virgin Islands and that maps for 27 European countries could be unlocked for a fee. This is incorrect. The Roadmate 3000T does not have the capability to unlock or load any other maps. I'm still in Germany and now I have a high-tech paper weight. Hopefully, I can find another Soldier roatating back to the States who'll pay me the purchase price for it. I'm really ticked off over this."
3,Cute Small Old Looking Book,"This book was almost what I expected. It was very small, cute, however, it looked a little older than I would have liked (sort of yellowish cover)."
4,Good immigrant novel Obasan,"The author is Japanese-Canadian like the main character Naomi in this novel. This novel is based on what author experienced. The story begins a couple of decades after WW II. The main character is in mid-thirty's. Suddenly her uncle died and she goes to see her aunt, Obasan. When she goes there, she starts reading her another aunt's diary and starts to remember how Japanese Canadians were treated during WW II. Naomi, a Japanese Canadian, is a 35-year-old school teacher. Even though she was born and raised in Canada just like her brother Stephan, She has more Japanese side in her. She is not totally Canadian nor Japanese. Her character is just like the status of Japanese Canadian during WW II, belonging both or belonging nowhere. The novel is about how immigrants from Japan were treated during WW II. It's about how they were accpted or denied from Canada. It's about the pane, such as alienation, they went through because their orgin is different."
5,A girl who does not know the terminology of oppression...,"The story of a little girl, Naomi, who does not know the terminology of oppression but beautifully paints her family's strength and suffering with images of memory and momento. Her silent, watchful eye allows us to see the pain endured by Japanese-Canadians during the course of the Second World War. Untainted by her Aunt Emily's political intent or her brother Stephen's fierce pride, Naomi comes to understand herself in the reflection of her mother, who disappeared in silence"
1,Puts you asleep midway garaunteed,This is one of the worst books I've ever read hands down. Making kids read this book for school is like forcing someone to eat poison. The book maybe had two or three parts that were actually interesting but the rest was as boring as it gets. It is also sort of confusing how the author makes so many flashbacks during the course of the book. It can be very mis leading. I don't recomend any one to read this book unless they have a sleeping disorder. Just read a couple pages of this book and you'll be asleep in no time.
1,This book is so boring.,Im sorry This book is so boring. It is hard to understand. I was forced to read this book in English class. I have to write a character essay about how Naomi changes. I wouldnt be able to do it if I didnt have the internet. Thank GOd I do.. I had to read the chapter summaries just to understand the book. it sucked.. sorry JOy Kogawa...
1,don't read this book,"This is without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever read. There is no plot or character development, far too much description of scenery and the way the story switches from the past to the present and back again makes the book impossible to understand. There are also parts of the book that are uneccessarily disgusting. This is a horrible book and it is an insult to its subject, the internment of Japanese-Canadians after the bombing of Pearl Harbour."
2,Obasan: About 250 Pages Too Long,"While having a good plotline, this book took 300 pages to tell what could've been written in 50. Good historical book, lets people know about events in the past, but just not a good novel."
4,Too Bad Young Reviewers were assigned this book!,"I think this is a great book. There are many reviews describing why I feel this way. My comment is about the youth reviewers that are so very negative and don't understand this book and hated trying to read it as a school assignment. WHY on earth would a teacher assign this book as required reading to any student in a lower grade than maybe the 12th? It is obvious by the reviews of the younger youth, they don't understand the way the book is written, they don't understand the impact of the subject of this book, they haven't grown up enough to see the ""big picture"". I think teachers should ""stretch"" students reading agendas but this is a stretch that for the majority of students will do nothing but turn them off from reading! This book is certainly appropriate as a college assignment."
3,"Historical aspect appreciated, content much to be desired","A great way to learn about the japanese-canadians internment, but frustrating that there is no resolution at the end because she never ""hears"" from her mother. author takes theme of ""silence"" way too far."
1,Don't read this book unless you have to,"I have be forced to read some pretty crappy books in my lifetime, but this book, I have to admit is the WORST punishment an English teacher could ever assign. This book is extremely boring, disgusting, dull, and horribly vivid. Take my advice and leave the book alone. (For those of you who are wondering, this was based on a high school freshmen's point of view)."
1,I didn't like it,"This book is really boring, and sometimes going from the diary enries back to the present is confusing, and everything is stretched on too long, there's no focus, and reading it just made me think, "" Okay, finished a book, what was it about?"""
2,L6 RAZR falls short,"I bought this for my wife, after having had good experience with a RAZR myself. Short story is that it's not nearly as high quality as I found my flip style RAZR to be-- the case feels plasticy and cheap, and the sound quality, even under excellent reception, was mediocre at best."
3,how could they leave out Bells of Ireland?,"Makes me wonder what other heirloom plants they may have completely left out. A kind of showy book, lots of nice photos.Is there substance to this book if they leave out something like Bells of Ireland?This book weighs at least 12 lbs. Why wouldn't they break it up into 4 books? Don't give this to an older relative, they will get a hernia trying to lift it."
3,"Looks good, but.....","I'm not nearly as excited about this book as some of the other readers. It is a great coffee table book with lots of great pictures, but as for the recipes I found them sadly lacking. Paul Kirks book is much better at half the price and I can guarantee it will be used twice as much. If I hadn't got mine as a gift I would have felt like I got ripped off."
5,This is the one !,I find that this is a great book for the beginner. I've got several friends that I'm immediately recommending this to. This is a must read for officiandos and beginners.I compete on a yearly basis in Kansas City and I'm glad to see the attention to detail to the fun that you have while Q'ing.Go get 'em Bettridge & Browne !
5,Darkly Beautiful,"In response to one of the reviews posted here, I must disagree with the statement that Boulez's conducting makes these works ""cynical, pedantic and profoundly ugly."" But then, I've never heard the Leonard Bernstein version of The Miraculous Mandarin, so he may have a point (please note sarcasm).These pieces are conducted in a very unromantic style that suits these works well in particular, and Bartok's entire output in general. There's nothing conventionally ""pretty"" at all about these works. But they are both truly beautiful, in a profoundly dark sense. The Miraculous Mandarin depicts the violence and the desperation of the story it is based upon, while the Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta is possibly the greatest orchestral work of the twentieth-century. Vivaldi this is not."
1,A Disk For People Who Dislike Music,"Maestro Boulez has a fantastic ear, good technique, and a formidable intellect. He has one slight impediment to conducting: he doesn't care for music very much. Or at least not music that embodies thought and feeling. Music for Strings is one of the most sublime testaments in Western music. The shattering climax of the first movement couldn't make Bartok's meaning plainer. But you'll never learn that from this perverse rendition. Boulez deliberately ignores the forceful accents, smoothing over them because he finds strong accents sentimental and stupid. The result is cynical, pedantic, and profoundly ugly. And the less said of this decidedly less than Miraculous Mandarin, the better. Any recording by a conductor who sympathizes with this music is preferable."
4,takes forever to receive,"this is a great deal if you're not in a hurry. i make sure i come back well before i have to recharge my minutes, it takes couple weeks for it to arrive if you purchase from amazon. i dont understand why they dont just ""digitally delivery"" this item, all you need is the code on the back of the card but it comes in a HUGE packaging box."
3,I have a question about this,"Do T-Mobile prepaid cards like this all come with a phone number? If not, which T-Mobile card should I get to get a new number? Thanks."
3,I love Mega Man,"I'm not an Otaku. I liked the Robot designs though. I think the show had some good points, the only reason why I bought these DVDs in the first place. The voice acting and animation are of decent quality. Too bad the storyline is rather weak in some episodes and terrible in others. I watch the bad episodes for laughs. I've seen some decent episodes considering the many flaws this series has. It is worth a try considering the fact the Mega Man cartoon won't get a makeover."
4,Central Line,"Not bad! Not bad at all. These British gentlemen put together a good, funky, album that's worth a listen. Give them a try, I think you'll appreciate the effort that they put in! I rate this: Four stars!!"
2,A good read but historicly innaccurate,"I enjoyed the book but found at least one innaccuracy. It claims George Wombwell (1788-1850; buried in Highgate West) was the first person to exhibit the Elephant Man (Joseph Merrick). Mr. Merrick was not born until 1862, twelve years after Mr. Wombwell's death. Since the book is primarily a historical guide, I cannot trust it's research and therefore could not recommend it."
3,Not really time honoured,"In 1975, BJH seemed to be the next 'big thing' in the area of progrock. Their previous albums had caught some attention and their style seemed to fit in well with the Genesis / King Crimson / PFM mood of the day. But it was short-lived. Their live double album had showed them at their best, featuring slow, romantic songs served on a carpet of mellotron and stretched out to infinity. Time Honoured Ghosts by contrast is a fairly normal studio album with relatively short songs on it. And they're not bad either. 'Titles' even became a real hit. The other memorable tune is 'Beyond the grave' with a more than a little touch of Procol Harum. BJH carried on to become big in certain countries, especially Germany, but Time Honoured Ghosts just wasn't strong enough to push them to the fore. In conclusion I would say: nice album if you are into getting a complete picture of the progrock scene of the seventies. Not much more."
4,A great BJH album,Time honoured Ghosts is one of the finest albumsss put out by BJH a great progressive rock band.This album is one of their best and his highly recommended.
4,A Good Battery,So far this seems like a good battery. I`ve had it for a while now and it still holds a good charge and good life.
3,Dell laptop battery,Doesn't seem to hold a charge for very long. About the same as the old one it had replaced. It's alright though.
4,ok,We used the battery for the computer for a while and it was a good investment. Eventually the battery stopped charging and we had to keep the computer plugged in.
3,Didn't work well,"I charged this product up as directed, and it still didn't work without the power cord. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking at it."
5,Great value and product,It was a great price and the battery works beautifully.I looked online and the prices were really high. I'm really happy and I really recommend this product.
3,Good,"Not as good as the original, but for the price it was worth it. The orignal battery only lasted 30 min at the end of it's life and this lasts around 1hr 30 min."
4,Dell Battery Working Out Fine!,Came to be that my old Dell Latitude Laptop needed a new battery but I was concerned about having to spend a lot of money on a battery specially b/c of the age of my laptop. I'm glad I checked on Amazon and found it for a great price. My laptop is working even faster now and have had no problems with this battery.
5,Laptop like new again,"Battery works as advertised, like new. Remains to be seen if it will last four years like the original. Great price great product what more could you ask for?"
3,Warranty,"I charged, and discharged the battery ,by the enclosed directions, It held a charge for about 5 more times, but, now, it will not charge,I replaced it with my old battery, and it charges. Ifeel that the battery is good,but might have bad contacts, I called, and was told warranty is still good. I will try it for one more week. Hopefully they will respect my warranty,because I am trying to make sure there is no mistakes on my part.For the price,and service, I would recomend this product,ifthey stannd behind it"
1,Low battery life,"I have a Latitude D600 and right when I popped this battery in, I only had 2.5 hours of battery life. I figured a brand new battery would have more power life then the one I had to replace...I have to dim my screen down to practically nothing to get more juice out of it.I'm very disappointed..."
1,Don't Buy,I think I need to return this battery. It only lasts less than an hour on a charge and my screen is dimmed when I use the battery.
1,mAh not specified = problem,"There are different levels of mAh in this batteriesMy labtop works with 4,4 mAh and the battery came with 5 mAH this difference makes that the battery only charges to a max of 17%If you are going to order check the mAH or you will be disapointed and the vendor does not specify this"
1,laptop battery,I am very dissapointed in the battery I purchased for my laptop. It lasted about ten minutes after I charged it up and it won't charge back up. This is the second bad battery that I have purchsed. I won't buy any more from Amazon.com.
1,Intermittent charging failures after 30 days,"The generic Dell battery was received as described and worked well for approximately 4 weeks. I provided a 5 star review, somewhere, after about 3 weeks of use, but now I am dissatisfied. Now, the battery refuses to charge most times; then suddenly will begin charging. All this began a week ago... a few days pass the(30 day)opportunity to return the battery! Not too happy and I hope it chooses to magically charge intermittently!"
1,DOA,"Battery was dead on arrival. Would not take a charge. Apparently, not new, as advertised. Did arrive very fast though."
3,good for value?,"I'm not an expert on laptop battery value, and this battery was recommended by a friend... I purchased it in April. Now it is Oct 1 and it has just died... I have a Dell Latitude D600. I don't use it ""off power"" very often... I was disappointed, but perhaps that is just the way it is with this battery... for most of its life it gave me about an hour to 2 hours of time away from the power source which was enough for me."
1,Battery in Bad Shape,"The battery I received does not last at all. I don't know if it is a problem with my notebook, but I've bought batteries before and this one seems to be a battery way past the end of its useful life."
5,replacement laptop battery for dell,"It's a fairly old Dell, the battery WAS the right part it DOES work it does hold a charge as I expected. I'm satisfied. I'd buy from these people again. Amazon did it's thing and the product arrived in a reasonable time frame too. And I'm happy I could purchase it in California."
1,piece of crap!,that piece of #$%^ only last 3 months and i can not get warranty on it.do not waste ur money on it!
3,It works,"I bought extra batteries for laptops that I have brought to folks in Tanzania, and usually I buy Dell's for them because they are pretty solid. These extra batteries do ok for a while, but they have considerable memory, and with Electricity being uncertain, it is hard to let them run out before plugging back in to recharge when power comes back on. The price isn't bad, so buying extra is ok, but it is a bit sad to see them run out so quickly. So, they are ok, inexpensive and might as well just be happy with that. I usually make sure my colleague's laptops have at least 2 batteries and possibly a third."
5,Good,"Best deal for a replacement Dell d600 battery! It's also a lithium ion type, not Nimh. So no need to worry about getting Charge memory problems."
1,latitude..d600,the battery is not working i waste my time and money on this products next time i will just buy the original one
4,Good replacement battery.,"I tried this battery as an alternative to Dell's overpriced replacement batteries. I use it in a Latitude D610. It was a little quirky at first. When I plugged in outlet power after drawing down the battery a bit, it didn't consistently begin charging. After using it for over a month, the problem appears to have resolved itself. Aside from that temporary quirk, the battery has performed well, and I consider it a great bargain."
3,"Works ok, but thought battery life on a brand new battery would be longer.","Works, but does not last very long, only about 2 hours. More recently it has been doing 1.5 hours. Also, check battery button works, but requires a lot of force."
4,Battery for Dell 600M,Good price and quick delivery. I have had no problems with this battery. It may not last as long as the Dell OEM but it certainly is close at less than half the price. I'm satisfied.
3,Could be better,"Battery arrived quickly and fully charged. Now six months latter it fails to keep charge at all. Disappointing. Good price, get what you pay for."
2,laptop Battery,This item was returned because it did not work at all. I followed the instructions completely for first time use but it still had no power. I purchased a grill cover which I really did not need only to get the free shipping. Since the battery did not work when it was returned I was charged the shipping charge.
2,Finally got working battery,Ordered replacement battery for Dell 600m on May 29. Received a defective one on June 2. Had to badger at maxipower to get an RMA. They diud not have order number. Person left who was first tech contact. Replacement finally came June 28th.
2,Disappointing,"The battery arrived in good time, but when installed in the computer, it would not charge.I returned it and received my refund with no problems.I then ordered a battery from Dell that was a little more expensive, but it works properly."
1,Product defective; seller did not honor commitment,Product defective. No charge on battery after full initial charge. Company sent RMA number for return. Never saw replacement nor money back. What a way to treat customers.
3,works,"Didn't come with the afore mentioned manual. It's a 2 hr charge for my laptop. Better than nothing, and cheap for an old model dell."
1,Doesn't work,"Bought this as a replacement for a dying battery. Unfortunately, I didn't need to actually use the laptop away from an outlet until a couple of months later. When I put in the new one, it doesn't work AT ALL. The battery itself seems to have a charge (the lights light up on it) but it gives ZERO power to the computer. Sadly, the return period has also expired, so I'm out the money I spent and am back to using the old bad battery which at least gives you a couple of minutes to turn off the computer if the power dies."
2,Select non oem/dell replacement parts at your peril,"Although these replacement batteries and adapters may work for a while, many DELL laptops aren't compatable with aftermarket accessories, especially power adapters and batteries.If you plan on keeping your laptop, get OEM at the best price points. My D-600 operating system repeatedly 'errored' some of these aftermarket components as being out of spec."
2,You get what you pay for!!!!,"I did not expect the best, and it surely is not. Battery does not charge to 100%. Linux Mint tells me at full charge it is only 87%. I have to run my screen at 50% brightness just to get 1 1/2 to 2 hours of battery use. At full brightness you would be lucky to get a good hour worth of use. Next time I will spend more for a genuine dell replacement! Shipping was also kind of slow."
2,Low Capacity After-market Battery,"I followed the recommended charge/discharge cycle instructions, but the battery discharges at a faster rate than is indicated for its capacity. Good price, slightly poor value. If I had the money to spend on a higher priced battery for my Inspiron 600m, I would have looked elsewhere."
3,An OK book on the topic,"Though Chilton and Haynes seem to be the only aftermarket auto service manuals available these days, they don't have the complete detailed information of the old ""Motor"" manuals (The big, blue books) of the past.Too much is left un-addressed by this and other Chilton manuals. If the topic you're looking for is covered adequately, great. If not - too bad. You're left with no reference at all or an abbreviated ""procedure"" that says to perform steps A, B,and C - but fails to tell you how to perform ""B"" and often that some pretty important steps happen between A and B.Better than nothing - but that's often not enough.If you have an older vehicle or one you prefer to service yourself as opposed to taking to a mechanic, I would suggest you pick up a copy (typically a set) of the original factory service manuals. Unfortunately, these are pretty pricey unless you can find a cast-off one."
3,"Pleasant and light, but Beecham this isn't","Chabrier's whipped-cream confections were a staple in the kit bag of Sir Thomas Beecham, and I guess DG decided somewhere along the line that Gardiner was his heir apparent. For a brief while they put the Vienna Phil., no less, at Gardiner's disposal, so there's a guarantee that the recordings would glow. The orchestra plays this mostly unfamiliar music with lovely tone and finesse. The missing ingredient is Beecham's infectious good humor and panache. Nothing goes wrong, but your spirits don't soar, either.I think the chief value of this CD is to gather so many little gems from Chabrioer's output. You're unlikely to hear any but Espana and the Marche joyeuse on pops concerts, but here they are gleaming bright."
3,A different Hitchens,"Hitchens is my favourite non-fiction writer. Perhaps I am a Philistine, but I didn't really enjoy this one - Hitchens today usually writes taut, apt prose, while this book is more on the flowery side. I also wasn't particularly interested in a lot of the subject matter, but this is perhaps because I was born in 1980. I'd recommend Love, Poverty and War over this as it is both more topical and contains more cutting and interesting writing."
4,Great for active people,"I must admit that I purchased this item because it was inexpensive and other users gave it a good review. I agree. This elastic strap is perfect for me. You can make it shorter or longer to fit your head and comfort level, and it holds my eyeglasses in place. All of my glasses have a little curve at my ears so this strap is great for them. If you have straight frames, I don't know if these will be right for you, but they can be tightened."
3,worked ok while they stayed on,I purchased these straps to help my sons glasses stay on his face. They worked OK - but were hard to get on. He could not put them on by himself and it was difficult for him to take his glasses off in the evenings when they were on.
4,Works great,"I bought this to hold on the wire-framed glasses of my nephew. His glasses were always sliding down his nose but these really work well at keeping the glasses where they need to be! Looked everywhere for these, even the eye glass shop where we purchased the glasses. A great fine!"
1,Elastic to the point it will not stay on,Nice design that was poorly made. For a few more cents these could have been a great band. My glasses are always slipping off my nose and face. The elastic at the temple end of the band is so flimsy that they will not hold onto the temple bar of the glasses.
3,A little tight for bigger heads,"Does what it's supposed to do, but even at its loosest it's too tight to be comfortable for my head, mine being a bit larger than average. Probably OK for kids and women."
1,Very unhappy with this product,The band is too tight and cannot hold my glasses comfortably. Would not recommend this band.
3,Uncomfortable -- Cheap,Very uncomfortable. I put them on the glasses once and took them off. I ordered them to exercise in but I just can't stand them.
1,Garbage,"This product is an absolute waste of time. If you are looking for an eyeglass holder, spend the extra few dollars to get a Croakies. The Flents Sports Band is an even bigger waste of money than lottery tickets. The closures never stay secure, the band loses elasticity within a short time, and the material of the band likes to pull out hair. Need I go on?"
1,Useless,"Bought these since I typically need regular and reading glassed. Useless. the cord is too short, and even if you extend it maximum, since it is elastic, it snaps tight. The eyeglass holders slip off when this happens and your glasses fall on. Dont bother with this one - I did not use it even for a day"
1,eyeglass retainer,"This product fits on the ends of eyeglass temples. With violent movements like dance and exercise, the product separates from the temple.Since I dance and exercise, this product is not adequate. The eyeglasses are not held in place during fast movements."
3,The Band does the job - Barely,"The band is OK, but I would have wanted a product that is geared for an adult wearer and usage. It is thin and small which makes putting it on more difficult. I have not found a better product to date so I use it. It does however do the job of keeping my glasses in place when I play racket sports. If it were ""expensive"" I would have been extremely disappointed. But for the price, it beats having nothing at all."
2,Misleading Title,"If you're expecting the same arrangements as heard on the Diana Krall: Live in Paris DVD or CD, you'll be most disappointed as I was. This Hal Leonard publication includes Hal Leonard arrangements of the tunes from Diana's live concert. Nope, nothing by Claus Ogerman in here. I don't even know if they're in the same key as from the concert. I already have some of these exact same arrangements in other books of standards for piano. If you want original transcriptions of pieces performed by Diana Krall in Paris, this is nice. If you want Diana's version of Joni Mitchell's ""A Case of You"" or Diana's version of anything for that matter, this is not it."
4,Good and Bad,"I have a love-hate relationship with this bird bath. My only problem with it, is that it tips over very easily on the tilt-to-clean bracket. We have squirrels who like to drink from it, but when they jump down from the edge of it, they knock it over. A gusty breese will also tip it over. I'm trying to come up with a way to secure it better so that it won't tip but so far I haven't come up with a plan that works.Otherwise, I love this bird bath. It's very easy to clean by just tilting it and rinse with clean water. The birds and squirrels love it too. Even the mourning doves will stop by for a drink."
3,Depends on who you want to make happy...,"I have this bird bath. My father has the shallow farm innovater with the scalloped edges. He gets much more activity because the birds are safer and happier in the shallow bowl. My bath gets little traffic, when the birds are on it they are very causious. It is deep, and they know it. I have put rocks in it to make it more shallow and that helps, but makes it harder to clean. The shallow ones dry up fast so you should mount it close to your door so you can maintain it. This deep one stays full much longer, so you are happier, but the birds... not so much."
2,Good for one season,I bought this item for the 2010/2011 winter season. It was very cold/snowy/icy in Indianapolis and it worked very well despite record snow/ice and cold. Even had 5 doves sitting in it keeping warm when it ran dry. Plugged it in this winter and it no longer heats. Seems like it should last longer than one season.
1,Not sure,"I purchased this bird bath over a month ago and still do not have it up. The bracket is made for a 4x4 post and my railing isn't that big... I've had to make numerous trips to the hardware store to figure out a solution to get it to fit. There are two size bolts and neither one was long enough for a smaller railing and the bracket isn't long enough either so when you screw the bolts in they slip below the bracket and will not hold it in place. Maybe once I figure out how to attach it securely, then I might be happy with it.It arrive quickly and eventually I think the birds will like it, but that remains to be seen."
1,Very Disappointing,"This is the worst product I've ever purchased from Amazon. The design is terrible. The mounting screws do not line up with the mounting plate, which distorts the shape of the mounting bracket so the tilt latch does not hold. Very cheap and frustrating design."
1,No longer available,"This product arrived without the required mounting brackets and had to be returned because, we were informed, it is no longer available."
3,It's OK,The bird bath is made of a good durable material. The product works as described. The only problem I have with it is that the so called lock feature on the tilt does not work properly. The bracket is either not cut properly or the lock portion is not large enough to keep the bird bath in place.
3,Did not snap into place.,"The idea is a good one but, the bowl lock would not snap together. My brother had to use his engineering abilities to rework the locking device."
1,Not a good bird bath,This bird bath's mounting bracket is woefully inadequate and does not secure the bath to a railing. At all. There is no way to easily modify it to make it work. It would be easier to create a new mounting bracket with material from a hardware store than it would be to alter the existing bracket to make it even marginally functional.
5,Birds use it!,"We installed this inexpensive bird bath very quickly on the railing of our deck. It did not take long for the birds in our area, eating from our bird feeders hanging from our home, to find and use this bowl of water for drinking and bathing. The neutral color blends into the decking and the ease of tilting the bowl to dump out the water to change is great. Just wipe the inside with a disposable paper towel after tilting out the water, and refill every couple days....and get out the binoculars to watch the bird activity~!"
1,taking a bath,The concept for this birdbath is great but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. It attaches with a 'friction' type clamp and has a lock tab that is supposed to engage an opening on the deck side of the clamp.The tab does not engage and the mount itself is very easy to loosen with just a little motion. Do not waste your time or money on this piece of plastic. I'd say it was for the birds but I doubt it would stand up to much aviary use.
2,would be perfect if.......,"API 645 Bird Bath Bowl with Tilt-to-Clean Deck Rail Mounting BracketIt would be a great birdbath if it were designed so that it can be mounted so as not to tilt over. I followed the directions to the letter, and it still wabbles all over the place. I even tried putting a brick under it to stablize it; it doesn't help. I will keep it because it's already on the deck, but barely. It seems others have had the same problem, I guess it all depends on the measurements of your deck railing or whatever you installing it to fit on. In my case, it doesn't work.Bought it thru Amazon."
3,Moderately recomment this API 645 birdbath,"Moderately recommend this product: The clamp to hold the bowl to the deck rail bends if tightened securely (I am in a high wind area and need to clamp it tightly). When it bends, it holds less well.The tilt process leaves something to be desired. The tilt bar slips into a slot on the base/clamping bracket. It is not a secured connection, and the tilt bar can come out of the slot if one is not careful. This leads to inadvertent spilling of water, the bowl falling to the ground, etc.There is also something about the birdbath that isn't right. That is, few birds use it (after a month in place). Perhaps it is too deep, but things don't improve when I fill it partially. Maybe birds like to bath closer to the ground (mine is located on a second floor deck with a roof over it). Maybe birds don't like to bath under a roof (but they come to bird feeders also located on this porch).It is light in weight (a good thing), a sturdy bowl and easy to install."
4,Very Good Book,"Using this book for a group Bible Study. I Purchased two books, one for myself and one for another lady. Both books arrived in a timely manner and both were in good condition. Thank you."
5,Timeless Beauty,I am ecstatic to have this issue of life magazine in my small collection of African American contribution to American society. Naomi Sims is one of the trail blazers in the modeling and beauty industry who is generally overlooked. The benefit to that is her books are still available in the market place for persons like me who's just discovered her. The magazine is in great condition and the delivery was on time.
5,"Great ""Old School"" camera strap!","Great Kalimar ""Old School"" camera strap at a great price of only $4.99. Looks and works very nice with my Minolta Dimage 7hi. Much better than the original cheap strap that came with my $1499.00 camera.Comes with 2 plastic clips and two metal triangular clips. I removed the extra clips and ran the nylon straps through the eyes on the camera. Wide strap is very comfortable on my neck after a long day. Grab one of these before RitzCamera runs out of them!"
2,Looks Great - Doesn't Last Long,"I loved this bird feeder at first. It is really beautiful. It has a clear plastic insert that goes inside to keep the seed dry and the seed does stay dry most of the time except in a really hard downpour.My complaint is, that I've only had it a short time and it already fell apart at the hinges. Then I realized upon inspection that they didn't even really connect the top hinges very well at all. There are holes in the hinge, but it looks like it was just lightly soldered on. No wonder it came apart at the hinge. This caused it to fall - it didn't fall very far but hit the deck and the inside plastic cracked.I really love how it looks. It is by far the favorite feeder I've had concerning aesthetics. However, it's not worth the price if it doesn't even make it through one summer without falling apart. I hope they fix this flaw. Just a little extra effort in the factory and this would be perfect."
1,Doesn't play nice with wifi,"I bought this item on ebay to connect to a set of speakers I had spare. I also have wifi in the house, and there are several access points around the area. This receiver cuts out after a few minutes of playing music, and most often when my laptop is on and I use the internet.I am also unable to change the volume with my phone, despite my phone supporting the option. I'm disappointed with this product and will be throwing it away."
2,What's the point?,"This thing makes no sense. I received it as a gift. Instead of just running a wire from the back of your stereo, you need to deal with all of these bulky, awkward electronics and multiple wires. I cannot believe that this thing made it to market."
5,Quality for Price,I have 3 of these heaters. They are reliable and efficient. The thing I like the most is that they are silent. A very good value for the money.
3,Decent heater for the price!,I've had the Original DeLonghi for over 20 years. It still works great. Looking to add a little relief to my heat pump on those colder days when the heat strips in the air handler have to come on to satisfy demand. This version seams to be smaller by almost a third and doesn't seem to have as much oil in it. Which theoretically for me makes this version less efficient than the one I bought oh so many years ago. Yes the new version is a bit sexier but when you need an efficient heater that's something I would sacrifice for efficiency.
2,Disapppointing,"Three feet away from heater and you might as well be outside. Does not heat a whole room, even a moderately sized room. If you live in a cool climate, perhaps it take the edge off, but for those of us in the extreme north, it is not effective. I recommend a tiny heater by Duraflame. The room it heats is larger than where we have the DeLonghi and it actually works!"
4,delonghi heater,"nice unit. keeps us from running the big house heater. probably won't work at the north pole, but in Florida it's ok."
5,Love my oil-filled radiator,"I bought this after spending time with my daughter in Seattle who was using two to heat her townhouse. I was impressed with the quiet heat and constant temperature. My office at home was always cold, even when the furnace was running and the fireplace was on this winter. When I would use my computer, my right hand (using the mouse) was always cold. Even when I run the DeLonghi at the lowest setting, this is the most comfortable room in my house. I've only had it about three weeks, but I'm hoping it will help on the energy bill. This is so much better than the electric fans I've had. Perfect heat. Love it."
5,Great Room Heater,"I am extremely pleased with this heating unit. I use it in my sunroom which can be drafty and cold when the temperature drops below 35 outside. It warms the room nicely and can be used on the ""frost' mode to insure that the exposed pipes in an unheated bathroom do not freeze if I am away for awhile. In that mode, it only activates when the temperature is below 45 degrees in the room--an energy-saving feature. I recommend this heater with enthusiasm."
2,Thermostat and ComforTemp busted after a season,"This product worked great last winter. I wish it had a more accurate digital thermostat, but I was very pleased with its performance, quiet, unobtrusiveness, etc. I rolled it into a corner for the warmer months and when I rolled it back out and plugged it in this winter the thermostat no longer seems to be working (room gets very hot), the ComforTemp button no longer lights up, and when I turn on the high heat the machine sparks internally and the second button does not always illuminate either.I have not yet contacted the manufacturer, but I am pessimistic because the warranty is for only one year."
3,Too hot on the surface,"I agree with most of the positive reviews, as this is a good heater that keeps the temperature fairly regulated (I live in Northern California, so no real cold spells here). I only give this product a three star because it is way too hot on the surface. If you touch it, you may burn yourself. Often, radiators that are very hot have another layer or grid protecting children from touching it (we have another deLonghi model with this feature). So, if you have small children, beware of it (though my child didn't get burnt; I did).Pros: does the job; keeps temperature fairly constant.Cons: exposed hot parts may cause burn; annoying bright green light.Bottom line: make sure nobody will touch it, and you'll be fine."
1,Delonghi 7707 Oil Filled Heater,"I have owned a similar DeLonghi heater for 14 years which has been fantastic, so I decided to purchase a new one which I planned to use in my home office. I have had the 7707 for about two weeks now, and I have decided I will be returning it. It functions just as good as the older heater, but it gives off this very potent oil type smell. Being that I work in my home office all day, and not knowing what is causing this smell, I am choosing not to be breathing this all day in an enclosed area. When I first turned it I didn't think much of as I thought it was just an oil coating or something on the heater which would burn off after a day or so, which is why I have kept it for two weeks, but it us still just as strong and the smell is not limited to my home office.Very disappointed."
1,Emits a bad smell,I've run the unit for 2 days straight and it still emits a really bad smell. I even tried running it outside for several hours but whatever fumes are coming from the unit are making me sick. The other reviews seem overly positive so maybe I just received a defective unit but I'm going to return this and try something else.If the smell wasn't an issue this heater would be perfect. The heat it puts out in great and the design is really nice too.
2,Didn't do the job for me,"I received it in operating condition. No problem there. But after running full-tilt all night with both switches and the comfort button switched on and the ""thermostat"" dial at max, a thermometer 6 feet from the heater only got up to 66 degrees. At 12' (the far end of the 10' x 12' room) it was 63. Returned it."
1,Piece of Junk,"This heater worked fine for about 3 months and then just stopped working - no indication as to the problem - it just stopped working at all - a waste of money if you are looking for something reliable for the long term. I've had similar heaters for more than 15 years that are still operating fine - this ""ComforTemo Technology"" is not highly reliable."
2,bad wheels,"I love this heater it warms like a charm, better than ceramic heaters. Unfortunately I would not buy this brand again because of the cheap wheel system. I accidently bumped one when moving it and the wheel broke. Other manufacturers have more sturdy wheels and have wings nuts you screw them on with. Then if you are moving you can remove the wheels so you can move it without breaking the wheels."
3,Excellent Heat Output but Off-gassing Irritating Smell,This heater works well for sleeping in our uninsulated rental house. Didn't want to run the noisy old gas heater at night. We ran the DeLonghi heater on full temp in the garage for for several days to allow the coating to burn off. Unfortunately after putting it into the bedroom it was still producing fumes causing throat irritation. It has gotten slightly better after two months but still need to keep it on the lowest setting to be tolorable. I'm not sure at this point if the coating is still an issue or if the oil inside is venting out.DeLonghi needs to work on this issue.
5,Nice soft heat with no noise.,This room heater offers a nice warm steady radiant heat. Not the sporadic warm air bursts from a fan over a heated coil type. No noise-----just soft heat. No drying air. The unit is hot to the touch but no more so than any other room heater. I love it for a room heater and this is the second one I have in use. This brand is long standing and of great quality.
2,Not That Good A Heater,I have a Honeywell oil filled heater that works great. This one unfortunetly seems to produce only about half the heat for the same amount of power. I can not recommend this heater for anyone when there are better ones out there.
2,did not perform as I expected........,Unstable on carpet........Very hot to the touch......making it difficult to move in another direction........Heat output very poor........Too expensive to ship it back......Would not recommend to a friend.....
4,Very Impressed,These heaters always make me nervous keeping them on but it does work well 30x14 room stays 70 when its 40 outside MAKE SURE YOU USE A 20A CIRCUIT
1,Loud popping noise,"I've tried to use this heater twice now, and both nights it just popped and made loud noises as it turned on throughou the night. I'm extremely tired right now. The worst part is that I boiught this item twice. The first time I bought it, it was great. I loved it. It was perfect. I gave it to my sister because my new apartment had central heat. But then I moved in and found out that heater was very loud. So I bought a new one of these, and the thing pops and makes very very loud noises. Why is the same exact model so much louder than the last one I bought???????"
5,Space heater,"DeLonghi EW7707CM Oil-filled Radiator with ComforTemp TechnologyI just recently purchased this product for my daughter's room. Our insulation in the walls is not very good and their is a draft in her room. This space heater has been wonderful. The first 8-10 hours, I let it run with all windows open because it has a funny smell and some smoke in the beginning. The manufacturer tells you to expect this...so nothing to worry. I have LOVED IT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT. Also, it is easy to wheel from room to room if necessary and is very compact and you can control the heat temperature via a dial."
5,Does a great job!,"We purchased our first DeLonghi radiator a couple of weeks back. The unit required no assembly of any kind. All you need to do is fold the wheels out after removing the unit from the box. The heat this unit produces is impressive! It raised the temperature by at least 10 degrees within an hour in an approximately 200 sq. ft area in our basement. This area has no other heat source and borders our garage. The controls are easy to use, and the ComforTemp feature is quite nice. We just purchased a 2nd unit to use around the house!"
4,I have a good DeLonghi,It does what it says. You can burn yourself on some spots so caution is called for. I am heating my living space entirely on this one space heater. I would like to buy another but I can't justify it. This one does a modest consistent good job. It is light too. I have no complaint.
1,Not good for me.,"This is a heater that would be good if you have the space and time to leave it on all the time. It does not heat up a room quickly and it's not supposed to. It is meant to be left on to cycle on and off to keep the room at a steady temperature. I will not leave a portable heated on when I am not home, so this did not work for me."
1,Smells..!,"I bought this heater 3 weeks ago and thought the smell would eventually go away..I had heard that initially there was some off gassing and a "" smell"" problem"" frommany of the comments, but even after 3 weeks it still smells like burning paint on metal, and it reeks....! It gave me a cough for 3 weeks and I felt it was damaging the surface of my lungs, so I decided it wasn't going to get much better and sent it back..."
2,Not impressed,"My husband told me to get an oil filled radiator last fall when our heat was out during the cold nights. We bought this one and it arrived fast. However, it didn't give off my heat unless you got right next to it. I was very disappointed that it barely worked, so I decided to return it. When I began packing everything up, I realized it had leaked oil all over the flood under it! Very disappointed in this product and would never get another one.I did give it two stars though because the size was nice."
2,no timer / stinky,"I had one of these heaters for a few years and wanted to get a second one. I did not realize that this one does not have a timer, which is very convenient for cold mornings. I would discourage this heater over one with a timer. It also had a stinky smell for the first few times it got warm, definitely not that new car smell."
3,No too hot,Warms the room a bit. Not as hot as expected but takes the chill off. Prefer the heaters that blow hot air rather than this type of heater.
5,"wonderful bargain, great heater","I have used several brands of these style heaters. This is super prices, and I got free shipping with Amazon prime. These brand heater warmer than all the others. I just ordered a second one I am so pleased with it."
1,quality & safety concern?,This heater came out of the box with the control panel hanging off & bared wires. Makes me wonder about the quality of the manufacturers product & raises safety concerns about an item that is supposed to be left connected to a power supply. Needless to say I am returning for a refund.
2,Doesn't measure up to two comparable space heaters,"I bought three new space heaters at one time so I could see which one heats a room the best and then purchase more of that particular one to supplement my heating system. I've now been using this DeLonghi radiator heater, theHoneywell HZ-617 Low Profile Silent Comfort Heater, and theLasko 755320 Ceramic Tower Heater with Digital Display and Remote Controlfor about a month.This DeLonghi puts out the least amount of heat of the three. Other than the heat output, this is a fine heater. There have been no mechanical problems, it's quiet, and looks fine. It's more compact than it appears in the photo. I would not recommend this over some of the other heaters out there."
4,Warm enough for a lab for 6 people but too fragile wheels,"we are using this for our research lab which in summer is too cold and in winter is not worm enough! so first we thought of buying one to see of it is worm enough or not and then go for the second one.( I bought it in winter time)one was enough. we are so happy with this product. and specially super fast shipping butone of the wheels broke from a very slow hit with the frame of a desk! plastic wheels support or subject to be broken so easily. however, we are still using it happily andthis is more a design feedback. so the wheels are not pretty or strong enough for handling this tall and thin body!"
3,"good product, with one caveat","This is a great little heater for a small space. But beware - the smell is terrible. After nearly a month of using it every day, the smell is still not gone (I'm guessing that the smell is from the paint on the surface of the heater). The heater is in my small basement, turned on the lowest possible setting, just warm enough to keep the chill off and eliminate dampness. It has added about $1.00 per day to my electric bill."
5,Safe! Works great around frenzied pets.,"Aside from the plastiky smell it had for the first week or so, this heater is fantastic.I followed the instructions, and turned it on full blast outside for two hours. I recommend you double that time, because it still smelled.It went away though, with use.This smell of which I speak should not dissuade you from buying the heater, tho. I put it on 1/4 power and turn off one side before I leave home for the day to keep my crated dog cozy. When I come home the room is the perfect temp, not too hot.It's very adjustable, and actually heats up the room rather quickly on full blast."
4,Great Heater,"Great heater and does the job admirably. Used it for the first time last night, with a low setting of 2, it gradually warmed up the large master bedroom throughout the night, where by the early morning it had to be turned off because it was getting too hot.It'd be nice if it had an auto shutoff or a self timer.Only thing I didn't care for was the faint smell, which is probably due to the oil. The faint smell is present after the unit is heated up. Not sure if the slight smell will still occur after several use of the heater.Update Nov 2012:Used the unit for couple of winters now, and it is still running like a champ. To answer my own question, the faint smell does go away after approx 2 uses. Have since purchased another unit for my grandmother who resides in a 55+ community. She uses this unit instead of the central heating. The wheels allows for easier transport between living room and the bedroom."
5,Love this,"I live in a large apartment with central air. My heating costs were so high last year, that I turned it down to just low enuf to keep the pipes warm and purchased this unit for my bedroom. First, I like that it's on wheels so I can move it if I wish to. I like the different temperature settings. Even on a low setting, this baby cranks it out. I feel safer with this type of unit than with the kind where you can see the red heating elements in the front. It's also sturdy enough that my cat and two small dogs can't knock it over, but it's lightweight enough that I can move it easily. My only complaint? Wish I could find a way to get a second one into my bathroom...boy it gets cold in there! Oh, and it's completely quiet too."
4,Just what I needed!,"I purchased this heater to heat my massage therapy office. So far it has worked great and my clients are toasty. It's nice because it's quiet and has many adjustable heat levels. I have found that it takes a good 20-30 min for it to crank up and heat the room when I first turn it on, but after that it stays very warm. Since this is the first winter I've had it I'm not sure if it will favorably offset my oil heat bill, but I'm hoping so. I've also used it in my apartment. It worked great for two regular rooms or one large room, but beyond that it struggled to keep up. I purchased it in Nov '07 through Amazon for $58 (no ship fee), but see that they have reduced it to $50. I am completely satisfied and think it is well worth the price even at $58."
4,Great deal and good performance,"A great powerful radiator, does its job, very nice price, too. The only minus is it still smells of oil when I turn it up high.(a month later)"
2,One of two leaked.,"I admit that I purchased two of these units from Lowes last year on a close-out sale for only $29.99 each. But when one of the units started leaking oil after two months of use, the shipping cost to have it replaced or repaired by DeLonghi was $16.00 more than I had paid for the unit.So, I mixed up an epoxy compound, about $4.00 worth, and plugged the leak myself. It has not leaked since, but both of my Chinese manufactured units are of much lessor quality, and only have about 60% to 70% of the heating capability, when brand new, as my ten year old Canadian made unit that I bought at Home Depot for a full price of $39.95.Both units, after only a total of about five months of light use are starting to fail when used to try warm up a small area of around 50 square feet."
2,Noisy Thermostat,"Possibly a defective product, but the thermostat cycled on and off LOUDLY even when the unit was not anywhere near the room temperature called for. No reason for this to have occurred and loud enough to wake me from my sleep."
2,Too Hot,It seems unstable when trying to roll to different spot and gets so hot you can't touch it without wearing oven gloves. I have to be sure it isn't anyplace where my pets or grandchildren can touch it. It really burns things.
4,space heater.,"I bougth this for my daughter that is away at school.she loves it, she only has to keep it on for about an hour or so and it keeps her room warm and toasty."
5,Works as advertised,"I've read many reviews of this product before and now after over 2 months of use. Basically works as advertised. Do not expect it to heat any room instantly, i.e. it's a radiator! Do not expect it to be OK to touch, i.e. it's a heater! Do not expect it to not smell upon first use, i.e. it's oil-filled! But if you want a safe, fairly easy to move around from room to room, economical (compared to box space heaters), quiet heater for a 12 x 15 room that maintains a steady temperature, it works great!"
5,Great Oil Radiator,"I've had this radiator for 2 months now and I love it. I purchased it for my 7 months old baby's room, since I don't like running the central air at night. This Delonghi radiator is compact and efficient enough to keep my baby's 11'x13' room at the ideal temperature in the cold nights of Chicago. It has the ComforTemp technology, which helps keep the room at an ideal set temperature. If you keep the ComforTemp button pressed, a little green light turns on you can choose between min. med. high. buttons to set the desired temperature. This way it saves energy. My ComEd bill hasn't really gone up, since I got it. If you want to be in control, than you can switch off the ComforTemp button and set the thermostat up to 6. It doesn't dry the air either, in fact, I am not even using a humidifier. I only put some water in a bowl on it by night, just in case. It does get hot to the touch, well, it is a heater. I highly recommend this heater, for who needs it."
5,good product,"I received the radiator very fast, it was in its original box and i was wondering if during shipping it got some damage. After opening it did not find any damage and it works just fine .I am using it for a small room and not every day. So far it works well."
2,Works well while it worked,"This radiator worked well while it worked, but the biggest problem with these is that they don't last. I've bought several of these in the past and they didn't last more than a year or two. This one lasted just under one year. That is disappointing. I don't think I will ever buy one again, as it is too expensive to keep replacing them every year, especially considering that it was only used in the winter months so it wasn't even really used for a full year."
3,Just ok,"While this heater does provide warmth, it does a poor job of warming a room. I keep this heater set at its highest level at all times just keep get increase the room temp about 5-6 degrees. Best suited for sitting next to it to stay warm."
4,works great,"the heater seems to work very well, and is a good value.It is important to let it run for a while before using it in your home though, it does smell for a while.I actually turned it on outside and let it run for a few hours on high, and that took most of the smell out."
3,Crapped Out After 3 Years,"This was my third and last winter with this heater. Last night as I was working at my computer, I caught a faint smell of melted plastic. I turned around and looked at the heater. Right as I approached it, it made a loud pop sound and I saw a bright flash of open flame within the inner workings for a few seconds. I immediately shut it off and unplugged it. Obviously, I won't be turning it on again.It would appear that it only included a 1 year warranty. So, that's something to think about at least. I would think it would last a little longer than a few years, but then again I'm no expert. It looks like there is an optional 2 year extended warranty that you can purchase. See source: [...]In regards to the function of the unit, I was happy with it's performance. Overall, it just doesn't last as long as I would have liked. If you purchase this unit, just make sure to keep it away from loose fabric, curtains, table cloths, etc. As there is a chance of combustion over time."
4,worked fine for 10 years but...,when i accidently knocked it over=it stopped working-i hear a piece knocking around inside....i dont know what else to write
5,Nice but chipper at Wal-Mart,"I bought 2 from Amazon, one for $40 and one for $50 (thank you for the free shipping). The radiator itself is perfect still don't know if I am saving money. However just yesterday I went to Wal-Mart and a similar radiator, again ""DeLonghi"" is selling for $35.Amazon should do something about that. Or no one will buy one from them."
1,it heat a big when set at high temperature,"I have a rented apartment in an apartment building and I have homosexual that use the apartment beside it. Because homosexual bedroom is nearby my bedroom , homosexual that cannot make implication of noises that i do especially in it. it I purchased this artifact because not make noise. it is no noise at any occasion. Since with homosexual not only the noise is the matter I have to change the artifact from the bedroom where is immobile scanning how to get gain from me. To avoid to deteriorate the plug connector i decided to leave in that bedroom alone. Homosexual that take my impression and that be other aspect and for what i speak of that impression if the seen aspect is other. Then is better to speak of that aspect, no? For that in 30 hours with another very low heat get temperature for tissues"
3,Oil smell when turned up high,"Have higher end DeLonghi and there is no smell, otherwise works fine for room heating."
3,Heat,"Bought this about 3 weeks ago. It still smells a bit. Smelled really bad for the first 2 weeks. Leaving in on full blast for 3 or 4 hrs doesn't really get rid of the smell like the manual suggests. Apart from the smell it is easy to use, it is reasonably cheap, it heats very well for it's size."
3,good for the price,I brought two of these heaters for an unheated room that gets very cold and that I use rarely. These heaters work well. They provide adaquate heat to make the room nice and cozy. I would reccomend them to anyone.
4,Great item but it sometimes overheats the room,it works great and heats the room pretty fast. However it occationally overheats the room even I turned it to the lowest tempurature. And it doesn't have a timer.
1,Oil leaks,"This product will leak oil after months of usage. Maybe sooner than you think. When it leaks, you will feel the room is filled with fumes. Its product is not reliable any more."
3,I guess It's Ok,"This has no fans, so there is no heat blowing directly at you. Good for rooms that tend to be smaller/medium-sized rather than larger since it works by raising the ambient temperature of the room, and bigger rooms may take a while. But even so, in bigger rooms (carpeted) it can probably remove the edge off the cold. If it were a tiled room, even medium-sized, I'm not sure how well it would work. It does get kind of hot on the fins.I would probably not buy it had I known what I do now."
3,okay not great,wheel broke off removing it from carton. real pain to stabilize with blocks.too many buttons to operate.still testing for optimal setting.shb
2,Malfunctioned product,"I was so excited to get this radiator but when I received it I noticed that it creates a spark inside when I turn it on or off. I was trying to return it but was told to call DeLonghi customer service, the phone number listed in the instructional booklet never seemed to work. Even though I think it is a manufacturing problem I was told I have to pay the shipping costs for it to be serviced in a service center (new radiator!!). After I considered the cost of shipment of this quite a heavy piece I continuted using it, the spark went away but the heater seemed not to be able to warm up my baby's room on a highest setting. After a month's of use (nights only) our electrical bill was $150 higher than normal - it eats a lot of energy (1500W). I think I will buy a Seimens radiator now they seem to have proven product quality. Anyone wants mine for free? I am throwing it away and I am not buying any DeLonghi products anymore."
3,Does not provide much heat at all,"I bought this heater based on all the reviews on this site. Almost all of them were positive and said that this heater did a great job of heating fairly large rooms. I put it in a 25x15 room, and it failed miserably. Even with the heat set at 63, this thing did little to maintain a comfortable temperature.And its not just that I got a bad one -- I returned my first one b/c I thought it was broken. Turns out that either they are all broken, or they just don't do much other than heat themselves.I hope it was just the two that I received. But I am not trying for a third. I would not recommend buying this.*** UPDATED ***New ones work (yes, I bought two). I must have just received a bad batch. I would now recommend this product with 4 stars."
2,Didn't heat my room,"Only heated a radius of about 4 feet around the unit, and I had purchased it for a room that is more like 10x15. I didn't expect to be able to get the room like a sauna, but it did a pitiful job. I went back to using a far smaller heater with a small fan that I was trying to replace. I don't know if it was a problem with the unit, or with the settings that it had not being good enough..."
5,amazing,"I use this heater in my big truck with generator I save 40 dolar a night instead having my engine runnig and polutin ,like this I am green and the units give heat in the lower dial perfect buy it now"
1,Heats well but smells bad,"I had great expectations for this heater after reading other reviews, but my wife and I were extremely disappointed when we got the heater and plugged it in. It heated our 200 square foot room nicely, but it gave off a strong odor that I thought smelled like ""hot metal"" and my wife desribed as ""hot oil."" After talking to a friend who had a similar heater, and reading various reviews on the internet, we thought maybe it was a ""new"" smell that would burn off. In fact the manual states that there may be a smell that will burn off after about 2 hours. Other reviews we read were more pessimistic, stating the smell never burned off. We shared that latter experience. I put the heater out on a porch and kept in on for several days... well over 30 hours. The smell never went away when the heater was on and even on the open porch we could smell it within from couple of feet away."
2,Toxic Fumes,"I like the silent, steady heat provided by oil-filled radiators, but this particular model emits toxic fumes. The odor is somewhere between burnt rubber and paint remover. It irritates the back of my throat and the fumes predictably intensify with a higher heat setting. I've been able to burn off most, but certainly not all, of the fumes by running it outside on the porch for four hours.Bought a similar (non-delonghi) heater at wally-world for thirty eight dollahs and have noticed no fumes from this cheapo model. It heats just as well and is every bit as Chinese as the delonghi. Perhaps it's killing me with some undetectable electo-magnetic waves or something, but at least I don't have a sore throat."
4,great source of heat,My husband bought this for our infant son's room. I thought it was a little too much to spend but I now think it was a smart purchase. We have an old house and this has helped to keep his room warm during the night. It releases a nice steady heat. My one caution is that I worry about little ones touching it. As our son gets bigger that might be an issue and I have worried when my friend's kids have come in to his room that it might be too hot to the touch. It definitely wouldnt scold them but it is very warm and if they touched it for a long period of time than it might hurt them. I'm also a first time mom so maybe I am just a little paranoid.
2,I question the safety of these things.....,"I purchased this item to use in the bedroom we keep our kittens in during the day and during bed time as it gets very cold in there, to say the least I did not like this product...Pros:Nothing I can think of.Cons:Cord gets very warm when on full power.even on low the unit is way too hot to touch.It smells pretty awful when operating, even after days of use.the wheels/legs are very flimsy.it really is not so good at warming up a room, a lasko ceramic heater fan warmed up our bedroom more in 15 minutes than this warmed it up after 2 hours."
2,Little chilly,"This little heater does not produce the amount of heat that we expected. we are trying to heat a room about 8'X10', it take a long time for it to warm the room up. It has no fan or blower system of any kind, since it does not get real hot, it takes at least a couple hours to warm the room. It never gets real ""toasty"" warm in the room. I was disappointed, it works fine, but just seems to not have the power I thought it would."
1,flaw design,"even set the thermostat highest, it still tripped even room is cold. dont waste money on this flaw design"
2,"Slow to heat, requires some air movement to work well, and takes up a lot of space","We bought three of these heaters last year to augment our heat pump. My husband likes his just fine, but I am not as satisfied with mine.The problems I've encountered:1. The heaters take up a lot of floor space. You have to have some clearance around them to keep nearby items from catching fire and this takes up a lot of much-needed floor space.2. The heater needs a ceiling fan moving or some other kind of air stirring to work to its best effect. I prefer a heater with a fan setting that will stir the air up instead of just a radiator.3. The heater is slower than my smaller fan-based heater. If you're really cold coming inside, this heater will not get you warm quickly.My husband, who is not as cold-natured as I am, uses his DeLonghi heater in the basement just fine. But if you want to get warm faster without having to have a fan on and take up a lot of floor space, you might look at a smaller fan-based heater."
4,If you are experiencing a louding clicking noise after not using for a long time..,"Just posting this for trouble shooting. I was getting a loud clicking noise while operating my Delonghi 6705L heater. In order to solve the problem I had to take apart the entire unit, disconnect all the electric wires and remove the heater coil from the resevior using a pair of channel lock pliers. You'll need to break the o-ring seal on the unit in order to remove the heater coil. I would not recommend this to the inexperienced user. If you do try it make sure to clean the metal o-ring sealing surface with a piece of fine sand paper before scewing the heater coil back in. Once assembled run the unit on high for a while and make sure that there is no oil leaking from the area."
1,"Good at first, but...","We purchased at the beginning of the year because the forced air heater we were using in our bedroom left me with headaches and a bloody nose and I was worried the same would happen to our newborn.Upon reading the good reviews of this unit I purchased it and it worked great for the rest of the winter and chilly spring nights. I constantly had to turn the unit down because it was really warming up the bedroom.But I just pulled it out for use about a month ago and it has failed to perform. I leave it on high all night and it still does not warm up the room. I have to run the other space heater along with it to warm up the room, then turn off the other heater before it gives me a headache. This goes on several times during the night.I wanted to return it since it is still under warranty but DeLonghi says I have to pay for shipping it! This was a good heater, but it would be nice if it lasted longer then 11 months."
2,Defective?,"I bought this heater at Kmart, but returned it. The thermostat would keep switching the unit off, even though the target temperature was not reached, and at the highest thermostat setting. I imagine the unit would have been more powerful had this not been the case. It was the clincher when my little bathroom heater - a Holmes ceramic oscillating heater could keep my living room/kitchen area warmer at less than half the price. I gave this a couple of hours of trial, but it just wasn't good enough for my purposes. I also own an older model version Delonghi oil-filled radiator that has a forced fan on it, too. The latter is a much better heater and has faithfully been used upstairs for years with a good thermostat that works as you would expect. I have a Vornado DVH on the way and will give that a try for downstairs."
4,I like it ...,"Although it takes a little while to feel the room heat up, this product does well in keeping a room warm once it ""hits its mark"". I like the controls that can regulate the temperature. Once you have the atmosphere you want you can either ""notch down"" on the watts or the dial; so it's not always pulling max electric energy, you can press the ComforTemp button. It's quiet and portable. So far, so good - I like it ..."
5,excellent product,"Product is excellent. The only complaint I have is that on the high setting it is too hot for my cats to be around. Otherwise, it is great."
3,DeLonghi EW7707CM,"Pros: Light-weight, silent, DeLonghi brand.Cons: Arrived damaged. Should probably blame the shipping company. Doesn't have a thermostat, only three heat settings. Still smells paint."
3,High Pitched Noise,"This unit heats up a small room nicely, but it's just a little too noisy for light sleepers. When it's first turned on, there's a series of loud popping noises (like pop corn) until the oil is heated up. It takes about 5-10 minutes and it stops for the most part. I have noticed some oil leaks from time to time, but not a huge amount of oil. After the heater gets running well, it lets out a high pitched whine that I would never be able to sleep to. I have two of these heaters and I don't use either to heat the bedroom. I'm looking into getting a silent space heater and only using these for the living/family room. Overall, it's a great heater to serve it's purpose, but I wouldn't use it for the bedroom if you're a light sleeper or sensitive to high pitched noises."
4,Effective,"It's quiet and works well. My only complaint is that the heater clicks to indicate when it's turning on or off, which can be a little distracting. I would have preferred a real thermostat, or even the dial with no indicator clicks. But the clicks aren't loud enough to be a real bother.Aside from the indicator clicks, it's silent, heats my bedroom in under an hour, maintains temp well, stays at a safe temp to touch, and makes it much easier to get out of bed in the morning. I'm happy with it."
