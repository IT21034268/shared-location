1,Cursing!,"The stories are well told on this audiobook; we are a homeschooling family. Imagine my shock when I was in the next room as my son was listening to this in his room, and I hear the ""f"" word, not once, but used repeatedly in one of the stories on disc 6! I could not believe it. I do not need audiobooks suggesting this type of language to my son! I was shocked and replayed it, and there it was, repeatedly. Be warned."
4,Brilliantly Original But Uneven,"Unlike most reviewers of this novel, I hadn't heard of Julian Barnes until I read ""The Lemon Table: Stories,"" a quirky, diverse and elegant compliation of stories. This novel is as varied, and it reads more like essays on mythic and eternal principles, such as creation, love and afterlife. I agree with some of the reviewers that ceratain of the stories/essays are astonishingly profound and well written and others are simplistic and tedious. That said, however, Julian Barnes is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. This is a must read."
3,"Skip ""Parenthisis""","I would have gladly given this book 4 stars, but for the unnumbered ""half"" chapter ""Parenthesis"" inserted between chapters 8 & 9. It was like I was suddenly reading a different and very bad novel(?). I almost put the book down, or at least stopped and moved on to Chapter 9. ""Parenthesis"" is a rambling, self-indulgent, disjointed, whining diatribe on the nature of love...yawn. Not only does it needlessly disrupt the otherwise excellent narratives, it is poorly written and may easily have been penned by a lovesick adolescent making his/her first attempt at writing prose. To his credit, Mr. Barnes lets the reader know it is parenthetical to the rest of the book, but it would have been much more to his credit if he had just left it out altogether. I recommend the book, but when you get to ""Parenthesis,"" SKIP IT! It is a waste of time."
3,A bit of a disappointment,I had read this book first when I was in college and I had the impression that I had really liked it. Years after that I returned to the book and found it a bit cryptic for me and definitely not as fun as I had remembered.
3,Vampire like Humans fight for StarFleet like moral code,"This first book of the Sime/ Gen universe is a little rough, but is worth reading. The sequel was much better, and by the end of that one , you're hooked! The Star Trek like philosophy held by the Members Of Zeor is compelling. This book is written by a Star Trek Fan, payment in kind."
5,Sacred Meditations,"I am satisfied, with the purchased I made and the length of time it took for me to I received it."
4,Great book for practical ideas,"I liked this book a lot. Ned Vankecich takes spends more time coming up with practical solutions for everyday folk instead of focusing in on the original and explanation of the problem. This is not a ""doom-and-gloom"" book. It is written with enough ""bright-side"" to keep me confident that we can get through the first few months of the millennium. Some of Ned's ideas are a little odd, like keeping a body bag in your house in the event that an elderly loved-one dies. However, as Ned reiterates over and over, ""what if..?"""
4,Great collection of ice cream favorites,"... It was so easy to follow, comprehensive, and complete that I had to buy it. It contains all of our favorite flavors like pumpkin, rum raisin, and green tea ice cream. I love the quick egg nog recipe. In addition it has two basic ""create your own flavor"" recipes. The raw eggs were a concern for my family--but i just substituted ""egg beaters"" or some other pasturized egg product for the egg yolks--every recipe has come out perfect so far. This is a keeper. ..."
2,Messy,"This marker goes on pretty messily on nonporous surfaces. Very useless for the surface I was going to use it on, namely metal firearm magazines. It works ok on cardboard and paper where the excess paint cam be absorbed by the material, if that's the type of application you will be using it for then it should work well."
4,"Works fine, but doesn't hold much ink","These markers work fine, but run out of ink fairly quickly. This makes them too expensive to use for line drawings."
2,"Nice pen, but did not serve my purpose","I wanted to paint on material, but it just soaks right through and does not leave a clear, sharp image. Might be fine for other surfaces, but not much good on cloth."
1,Very Bad Book,"This book was probably the worst book I've read in my life so far. . It's just this one book... it's the worst Hardy Boy book ever made basicly. Just avoid this one unless you want it as a collection book. Don't get me wrong tho The Hardy Boys do rock and a lot of their books are good, so don't give up on em"
3,A Smuggling Ring,"Overall, this book was alright, but Dixon could have done a lot better. There was not as much excitement in this one as there is in the other ones. The book starts out with a man who hires the Hardy's to plan a trip that they can go on. The man doesn't want to go on an airplane, a cruiseline, or a train, so eventually they think of a freighter and find themselves in the middle of a smuggling ring. The smugglers will do anything to get rid of them."
2,Not recommended,"I'm sorry I ordered this Book 26, the Phantom Freighter. The Sign of the Crooked Arrow is way better. I should have paid attention to the previous reviews but it wasn't a huge expenditure and a lesson in doing some research before ordering. No plot. Hilariously bad writing. Heck with nostalgic purchases, kids rated a thumbs down."
2,Weak Hardy Boys Book,"The Phantom Freighter is one of the lamer Hardy Boys entries. Athreadbare plot, no mystery whatsovever, and weak writing. The storyis about a group of smugglers who do their dirty work by freighter. I could have put this one together. The version I read was the revised text, and from what I understand the original isn't a whole lot better."
1,DUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BY DAVID H.,A misleading book.Very DUM!Can't understand the word DUM.DON'T EVEN READ OR LOOK AT THIS BOOK. It's just wast wasting your time.
4,"Very Good, Excellent Value",Good price value proposition. It certainly looks nice on my desk. It can easily be wall mounted or placed on a desk. The color of the frame is nice and dark and it holds four photos - two horizontal and two vertical. I almost never take photos in the vertical style - so found it difficult to get two good vertical pictures.
2,Sorry guys-Thumbs down,"This book is quite drab. It had decent concepts in mind. But animation books should be exciting, colourful, and full of interesting art. This black and white doozy was the opposite. This book put me to sleep. Not to mention the stuff in it looks like it was traced out of a Preston Blair book. If you dont know anything about flash or animation then step right up. You'll think this book is the Illusion of Life."
4,Latinologes Vol.I,"Latinologes is a great DVD. I saw the play. Even though the DVD does not have a rating I think it is PG-13 due to Sexual Content, and Language. This DVD has only 7 monologes and the play is not complete. In order to see the other monologes you have to buy LATINOLOGES Vol.II. In Vol. I you see Eugenio Derbez (HXDrbz, Derbez en Cuando , Al derecho y al Derbez) as Elian's father(Elian is the Cuban boy that washed of the cost of MIAMI) Rick Najera as Border Patrol and more"
3,Latino Comedy,"A series of Latino comedien(ne)s play Latino charechitures in order to make a laugh and hopefully to explode controlling images. This may have been a one-night event as the camera consistently moved from the Latino performers on stage to the Latino audience members laughing at what they see.This disc will make you giggle a lot, but you won't roll over and fall on the floor with laughter. This was like a Gomez-Pen~a performance, minus the abstractness and pronounced postmodernism. I loved seeing up and coming Latino actors being able to do their thing. Most were Mexican Americans, rather than other Latinos. This definitely had a West Coast flavor to which East Coast Latinos might not be able to relate."
1,Another Disappointment!!,"R.C. do your self a huge favor......Get Dennis Walker back on board, so you can make a decent record again! Trying to do what the country folks are doing with the political B.S. didn't cut it! I have bought eveything ou ever put out, and this is my LAST buy! Your concerts are getting more and more boring. Your band looks asleep! What the hell happened to you OLD MAN? You dont have the fire. you had it 10/15/20 years ago. I'm convinced now it was DENNIS WALKER's genius that put you on the map. I now have a new favorite....NICK MOSS AND THE FLIP TOPS."
3,Average Robert Still Great,"Like Van, or the Stones, Robert Cray has a formula that works for him. I am a huge fan and have been since day 1. I like the silky, smooth vocals and Stax/soul feel to his brand of blues. He does however need to branch out a little. Maybe back to some Chicago blues or swing a little but he has sounded a tad 'repeated' on the last few discs. I'd like to see his voice highlighted more (EX. ""Don't Break This Ring""...from 'A Shame and a Sin', incredible) and his guitar work put to the forefront. Yes, a little repepitive but 'already done' Cray is better than most stuff out there. Love to hear a live album from him!! Check yourself back into the 'Done We Wrong' motel lyrically, leave the political musings to others. Don't get me wrong, a great disc, but no new charted waters musically."
3,"Interesting, but Confusing","Obviously, the author knows his subject and writes about it from the many interviews he conducted. But these interviews seem to ""float in space"", without connecting them to the historical picture to round them out. Also, he jumps around quite a bit, and that can be very confusing. A chronological table, and perhaps some maps, would have helped"
4,A stunning album,"Olivia's breathtaking voice captures your heart from the moment you start playing this album. Many of her older tracks which have faded into obscurity and have never been released on any of Olivia's greatest hits album's are contained on this album including ""Angel Eyes"" and ""Someday"". ""I Honestly Love You"" is included as well as the upbeat ""Long Live Love"".Any Olivia fan will love this album and I highly recommend it."
5,YES.....LONG LIVE OLIVIA,JUST AS ANOTHER REVIEWER SAID *LONG LIVE OLIVIA* IT SEEMS LIKE SO MUCH OF THE MUSIC I LOOK FOR I ALWAYS HAVE TO GET IT VIA IMPORT. I GUESS THE MUSIC I LIKE GET'S PUT OUT OF PRINT IN THE U.S. LOL ... THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM *VERY SIMILAR TO THE U.S. IF YOU LOVE ME LET ME KNOW LP* ONLY WITHOUT THE SONG *MARY SKEFFINGTON* :( ... STILL A GREAT CD..........BOB
1,Battery recharge problem,"If the battery worked I would rate this unit a near 5. I really like this player and I wish Samsung could fix it. If the battery drains completely the player can't be recharged and will not turn on. I've sent this player back to Samsung 3 times for this problem. Samsung returns the unit, after 3-4 weeks, working and fully recharged but the problem happens all over again. Now it has happened for a 4th time. Samsung is either unable or unwilling to fix it. I'm stuck with a lemon."
4,Great player with small annoyance problem,"My boyfriend bought me this player for me for Christmas. He waited till Christmas eve befor looking and this one was the last hidden below something else. Anyways, it works great and accepts wma as well as mp3. It is just the perfect size and built to withstand the abuse that I can put things through. The only thing is that everytime I go to charge it I have to turn on the device first or it will freeze. If music starts playing before I can plug it into the computer then it freezes then too. So I have to have perfect timing with turning the device on and then connecting it to my computer befor it fully loads its software. Any other way of doing it causes it to freeze up and then I have to go locate a pin to push the reset button. VERRY annoying. Other than that I love this device."
2,"Nice for the first 3 months. From then on, hell.","It looks like the best player ever made. Until, of course, the warranty expires.And then we find out everything wrong with it...It scratches more easily than you would believe.Every new album I've put on it has blanked out the entire player and made me have to format it and resync my entire library.It holds nothing like 1GB of songs. More like 900 MB.It records so quietly you can hardly hear it.The earbuds hardly work.I would not buy this again, given 70 bucks. I would go for a completely different brand, different model. And next time I won't be fooled by 4 glowing reviews."
2,"Good for a while, then, 70 bucks down the drain","I bought this mini MP3 a while ago and loved it. Good radio, nice sound quality, and beautiful graphics. But then, it became possesed and said I needed to ""re-sync every freakin' song to listen."" ?!! RE-SYNC?!!!! I ALREADY SYNCED IT, I CAN'T DO IT AGAIN!!! So, I format it and attempt to download again, but the software rejects it once again. I get mad and break it accidentaly, and then I lose the stupid thing it's so small. Take my advice, avoid the un-neccasary anger and don't buy it. There's lots of other good quality MP3's out there, this ain't one of em."
1,Digital Audio Player,This item was returned to the manufacturer. It was great to look at and had wonderful sound. The graphics were really good but overall it's a poorly made unit. There's a lot better buys out there than this one.
4,Delicious and nutritious recipes for your favorite tastes!,"This is a super cookbook! My boyfriend and I love spicy food: Thai, Mexican, Chinese, Indian. But we also want to eat healthy and lose weight. (I'm doing Weight Watchers Online.) This book satisfies our need for ""take-out""-flavored food but with lower calories and saturated fat. We just had the Shrimp Pad Thai for dinner tonight, and it's terrific! So many lowfat recipes taste bland, but the pad Thai had a great kick from the chili sauce. All the recipes make at least 4 servings, so we have plenty of leftovers for healthy lunches! So we save money on dining out too! This is a great value. Finally, there are many recipes for appetizers that make a whole lot of servings, so I can make tasty hors d'oeuvres that I can eat without guilt! This book is great for anyone who wants to enjoy great-tasting lowfat food. Enjoy!"
4,Great for Flex Plan but not for Core,"Recipes do not indicate whether okay for core dieters. However, on flex plan as I am, very good book with great ideas."
5,DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO USE WEEKLY,I REALLY ENJOY THIS COOKBOOK. IT HAS LOTS OF VARIETY ITEMS THAT ARE EASY TO MAKE AND DELICIOUS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
5,"Favorite Cookbook, Diet or Regular","This is my family's favorite cookbook. The recipes are fun and I haven't hit a dud yet. When I cook from it my family doesn't know I am cooking ""light"", they just think it is delicious. I have shared more recipies from this cookbook than any other I own. I would highly recommend this cookbook to anyone, not just those who are on the Weight Watcher's plan. We are eating yet another recipe from this tonight. I can hardly wait!"
3,A LOT OF WORK!,"I CAN SEE WHY WEIGHT WATCHERS DISCONTINUED THIS COOKBOOK. THERE ARE A LOT OF INGREDIENTS THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE IN MY KITCHEN NORMALLY. ONCE I BOUGHT THESE UNUSUAL INGREDIENTS, IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO USE THEM, AND MAKE THEM NOT COST- EFFECTIVE. I WAS LOOKING FOR A SUBSTITUTE FOR CURRY PORK AND WAS DISAPPOINTED, BUT THE REUBEN SANDWHICH WAS GOOD AND FAIRLY SIMPLE. MY FAVORITE WEIGHT WATCHER COOKBOOK IS CALLED 'COOKING FOR TWO.' IT HAS A LOT OF RECIPES GOOD ENOUGH FOR COMPANY-THEY WON'T SUSPECT THEY ARE EATING WEIGHT WATCHERS. A LOT OF THE RECIPES IN 'COOKING FOR TWO,' YOU COOK DOUBLE AND FREEZE HALF, OR YOU MAKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND VERY TASTY WITH THE INGREDIENTS THE NEXT DAY. AS A MATTER OF FACT,I'M HAVING 'BEEF AND BEER STEW' TONIGHT!(PAGE 90-'COOKING FOR TWO')"
4,Love this one,this has lots of recipes you think you cant have till you see that each obne has the point values listed and makes it so easy .
5,Great lower calories alternatives,Excellent recipes for people like me who like take out taste but not take out pounds... The recipes are easy to follow and crowd pleasing.
2,Disappointing - why not just do take out?,"I was ready for recipes that offer less points or healthier but just as yummy dinners. Unfortunately, most of the dinners are as many points or a point less than going to a restaurant. If I am going to splurge, I'd rather have someone else prepare the meal!"
2,wasn't thrilled,"I was hoping that this cookbook had more traditional american take-out recipes, but was disappointed to see too many exotic recipes for my taste."
4,very handy to have around the house,good service rec'd book in excellent condition and very fast!! Good recipes for the health conscious consumer who may be trying to lose weight too! I love the book! and so does my family!
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT,IT HAS SOME OF MY FAVORITE RECIPIES FOR DINING OUT. I HAVE ONLY TRIED 1 RECIPE IN THE BOOK BUT I CAN TELL I WILL BY TRYING MORE OF THEM.
4,Lots of good stuff,"If you are into healthy eating and you like certain restaurant food, here's the book for you. There are many familiar foods here. All you need now is someone to serve it to you and someone to clean up...and who knows, with the weight you'll lose, you may find that someone."
5,Great book,I really love this book. It gives me the option to make the stuff I usually order and still lose weight. The instructions are easy and once you get the ingredients for one of the recipes you are pretty much able to use it over and over again for that entire section. Def must for you collection!!
3,Not my favorite,"I was really excited about this getting this book, but I have to say it is not my favorite. First, after using the book just a few times, the binding has cracked - one of the reasons I prefer the binder style cookbook. Also, one of the most common reasons I get take out is because its quick. None of these recipes are really quick. You can also find many of these recipes in other ww cookbooks. Since I got it for such a great price, its not that big of a deal, but there are definately better weight watchers or healthy cooking cookbooks to choose from."
5,Better than eating at a restaurant,"This cookbook is yet another great example how Weight Watchers makes it SO easy to eat wonderful dishes and lose weight. I bought this book because take-out in the American sense is rarely available where I live (Italy). My husband and I love Italian food, but needed some variety. We were especially missing Chinese food. This book has satisfied all of our cravings to the point that I do not know if we are ever going to get take-out again (when we return to the States).I HIGHLY recommend this cookbook and any other cookbook put forth by Weight Watchers. The dishes may come from a ""diet"" cookbook, but they do not taste ""diet"" in any way, shape or form."
5,WW Take-Out Tonight!,"Simply perfect for those who love to eat good food and won't diet because they think they can't! Cost less than eating out, you know what's in it and EVERY bit as good as the restaurant. My husband never knew it was WW and raved it was about time I was off that ""silly diet!"" Like eating gourmet. Some of the recipes take a bit longer and some skill, so not easy recipes for the beginner. Lots of new things you might not regularly stock in your pantry, either. But certainly tasty beyond belief when you are tired of routine and are dying to eat out! And it allows for the take-out taste without the take-out portions or extra ingredients (like MSG)."
4,Get it for the Chinese section!,"Most of the foods in this book are ones I don't eat, or prefer not to eat, but this cookbook gets 4 stars easily for its wonderful Chinese food section. I've tried half of the dinner recipes already and they've all been hits with my family. Many of the Thai recipes are also great."
3,Portions are skimpy,"The recipes in this cookbook are quite tasty, but the portions are skimpy!! There's no way I would be satisfied with one portion of these recipes.If you get this cookbook, prepare to eat tiny portions of the meals you fix and a huge bowl of salad to stay within a reasonable amount of calories but also get full. And I am not a big eater - I usually eat about 350-400 calories for dinner, but I also enjoy feeling satisfied. The tiny portions will satisfy caloric requirements, but will leave you feeling hungry. The recipes seem like normal recipes to me, not weight watchers. It's almost as if they took a normal cookbook, reduced portion size and slapped the WW label on the cover.This cookbook is beautiful, but misleading once you realize how small the portions are. Bummer.I found a lot more value in The Volumetrics Eating Plan, which uses a lot of the WW concepts (trading high-calorie foods for satisfying low-calorie ones)."
4,Back in the kitchen,"Since I love to cook, the worst part of dieting has always been a bunch of boring broiled meals--broiled fish, broiled chicken, etc. Not anymore! This cookbook has allowed me to get back to the kitchen with recipes that deliver the same satisfaction as their full fat and calorie counterparts. I've made at least eight recipes so far, and they have all been stellar. Can't wait to try the other 20 I've bookmarked. My only complaint is that I am a firm believer in using real food. Non-fat sour cream, in my book, is not a real food. Same for non-fat mayo. So a few of the recipes are off limits, while I can sometimes make substitutions (smaller quantities of full fat products) for others."
1,Chanakya DVD,"Inside the cover of DVD #4, DVD #3 is present. I have two DVD#3's now. Now I have to miss 4-5 episodes that were present in the DVD #4."
2,Great series but poor quality DVD,"Chanakya is a great series, extremely educational and entertaining - worth watching it. Unfortunately, several chapters in the 8 DVDs that I received do not have any sound. Without those chapters, it is difficult to follow the story and the whole series seems worthless. Moreover, DVD menu (chapter selection) does not work. Overall great series but horrible DVD quality. Not sure if it just my experience or others have seen this too."
2,Disappointment,"I was looking forward to watch all the episodes again (that's why I bought the whole collection), but am very disappointed that on the first CD, the second episode wasn't there, just skipped it! :-("
5,"The quintessential, crucial, unparalleled ambient album","I can only put William Orbit's ""Strange Cargo III"" in the same league. Here, the duo who, perhaps more than any act other than Can deserve the credit for changing modern music in the electronic age, present their swansong. Extremely different from the ""dance"" albums of the mid-eighties, this evocative album overwhelms the listener subliminally and overtly. Like so many artists, Cabaret Voltaire do not receive the attention that is given to their far less talented and innovative imitators."
5,"For those that 4:20, get this!","From the Awesome Exterminating Angel to the Stupendously long Project 80, this is one of the best CD's I have ever listened to. I would definitley recommend listening to this CD when you're Dazed and Confused with Low lighting!"
2,Pretty pictures but little content,When I began to use Frontpage I was given a copy of this book to help get started. While the book has many pictures - it provides no practical help when you start working with Frontpage. The online help will provide more details than this book. Check out the alternatives before deciding on this one.
2,Basic Coverage of a Complex Program,"For anyone who finds larger texts too intimidating, and who needs just a basic personal web site (for which FrontPage is eminently suited), this book may help, at least if read in conjunction with doing the examples in the ""Getting Started"" book accompanying FP2000.You'd have to like adages such as ""too many cooks spoil the broth"" and other non-technical stuff throughout, and an index of only average (i.e. poor) standard.For more serious web site builders who may wish to restrict access to some web pages, or who want to use FP2000's more advanced features, and given that Microsoft has made such a dog's breakfast of FP2000, this book has gaps that you could fly a jumbo jet through. Consequently, some of the steps outlined in the book do not work."
4,Christmas memories rekindled,"Just as I remember from childhood when my Italian grandfather gave this Torrone to us at Christmas each year, Delicious!"
1,Shamefully stale.,"I should have known this would happen since it is late September and Torrone is widely known as a Christmas occurrence. Still, I figured if Amazon would sponser it, it would be fresh. Big mistake.. It is as stale as stale can be. Ugly. Threw it out, and will proceed with more caution in the future. And of course, never buy this brand again, no matter the season. They should have not offered it in this terrible condition."
3,I wasn;t sure what I was buying...,"When I searched for ""gourmet toffee"" this product came up high on the list. Well, for starters, it's NOT toffee at all. It's an assortment of vanilla, lemon, and orange flavored nougat squares with almond pieces in it.Overall: delicious. Just not what I expected at all.Additionally: The packaging is really neat and Italian-looking."
5,Let's dance,that's a nice one.a great Dance-Song for your Summerparty.ATC = A Touch of Class are four trained (Is it the right word?) musical ssingers who met at a Cats-production. So they probably can really sing.If you like merry (Again is it the right word?) summer music you'll love this song.
4,Great Sounding,This collection has fine sound & good packaging. It would benefit greatly if it included some of the singles from his stint as lead singer of The Power Station. Overall a good buy.
1,YUK -- These are re-recorded,"The tiny print on the jewel case tells you what you need to know:""This album may contain re-recorded tracks by the original artist.""""Tracks featuring groups may not include the original members.""If hearing music from the year 1971 performed by aging vocalists accompanied by electronic drum machines is your gig, hey -- more power to you man."
4,Something for the TRUE hip hop fan,"I agree with one reviewer that this ain't pure heater beginnin to end, but Stic and Young Noble speak on things we NEED to hear instead of the same ol same ol. how many Nellys, Chingys, Lil Waynes can we stomach? Stic man of course there is gonna be that revolutionary Brooklyn flow and Noble with the Outlawz/Pac resume has something to say hisself!! the beats and message make up for the holes in this release. With everybody puttin out mixtapes these days, even the big bling blingas, this is a refreshing change of route, a good alternative to gettin an earful of the same gahbagE!!"
3,RBG 4 LIfe......,"This is way better than ""U Can't Sell Dope Forever"", let me make that clear. They actually put some thought and time into this. I am glad I purchased this because ""Can't Sell"" almost made me leave this one on the shelves. What I like about this release is the subject matter changes up. Its a relovlutionary album but that is not all they talk about. Stic Man and Noble lyrically step up on this album. The tracks are above average but are not pure heaters. But the soul put into the tracks make up for the producation. I wish cd's like this were promoted better, we as a people and Hip-Hop need this right now. Hotep!!!"
4,RBG OUTLAW,"This was a total surprise, I walked in the record store and I saw this and I had to buy it. Most Hip Hop Fans will be skeptical in buying this because of Young Noble but this is worth your money. Stic Man out shines Young Noble on this as I guessed he would but Young Noble holds his own. Daddy Loves You and Soul Music are one of my Favorites, and production on this album is worthy.Just go Copp this one Man..True Hip Hop Lives on..RBG for Life.."
2,Too many duplicates!,Last year I purchased Dave's...A Smooth Jazz Christmas...and was thrilled with it. So thrilled in fact that I thought I'd go ahead and buy this one. I looked at the ratings here at Amazon.com and thought I had nothing to lose. Now don't get me wrong...this is not a bad CD...though it isn't all that great either. My major complaint is that 9 of the 13 songs on it are also on 'A Smooth Jazz Christmas'. In my opinion...that is ridiculous! What was Dave thinking? Anyway...if you are thinking of buying one of Dave's Christmas CDs....forget this one...and buy 'A smooth Jazz Christmas' instead. It surpasses this one in all categories.
3,Only a Basic Overview,"This book is a collection of articles, many of which don't cover any new ground if you've had some exposure to this field. Many of the articles are very general and really only argue for the validity of the web-based approach rather than offer any practical insights for those already involved as practitioners or support staff.Interesting chapters (to me ) that offer a basis and inspiration for practical action include include one on Nestor, a web map building browser by Esnault & Zeiliger, France, and a chapter on audio/video streaming by Al Bentor, Univ of Baltimore."
4,"Good value, just not as easy to make ""tea"" out of it.","I buy both peppermint & chamomile tea in bulk for there fabulous benefits and find it quick and easy. With this Pau D'arco form of tea (which I have used the tea bag form so know it's flavor) it takes a long time at least 10 minutes of steeping to get the flavor I would get from a tea bag. Pau D'arco was many fabulous healing properties, so I do take the time to steep it."
3,Good and bad experiences.,"My three year old son was put on this at birth. He did just fine and I never had any problems with him digesting, having gas, constipation, ect...My daughter, that's another story. She got so constipated on this stuff she would go two days without going potty. And she started screaming terribly when she did go. She ended up being switched over to the GS soy, and then the natural cultures.All in all, it all depends on the baby. Try it on a small can, and then if it works well, go to WIC and have them pay for formula. You can get any type of Goodstart on wic. You just have to have a reason to get something other than the purple or orange can. That is the cheapest way to get it. And wic doesn't go by income. rich and poor both are welcome to wic."
2,"Terrible, terrible price.","We fed our baby this formula for several months - until we realized that we were spending nearly $150/month on formula alone.We consulted our pediatrician as well as a pediatric nutritionist, and both told us that there is very little difference in the formulas from major brands because they are heavily regulated.We then went to Costco where we were able to find the Kirkland brand of formula for $60.00 for six 25.7 oz cans. Read the label - it has all the brain boosting stuff (dha, etc.) as well as nearly identical vitamins, minerals, iron, etc. If you don't want the Kirkland brand, Costco also sells other major brands for similar prices.If for some reason you really want to pay more to get the Nestle brand, note as well that this 6-pack is at almost no financial advantage to buying a single can - the only benefit is that you get all 6 at once.By the way, we're big fans of Amazon.com in general - just not on this product."
2,Caused horrible constipation,"I'm sure it just depends on your child and their needs. We originally were using Similac but had to go on WIC and were put on Gerber Good Start Gentle Plus. Immediately he started having horrible constipation and hard bowels. We had to put juice in the formula just to keep him regular and it was always a balancing act, especially once he started solids. Recently we were once again able to pay for formula and switched back to similac. Immediately he was regular again, irregardless of being on solids. So for some this may be great, but if your child has constipation on it, you may just try a different brand formula, not necessarily switching to soy or a specialty kind."
2,Very Constipating,This formula is totally constipating. My son started out okay on the formula at first but the more we used it the more constipated he seemed to get. I gave the product 2 stars because it had 2 pluses: the formula did taste similar to milk and does not foam up very much. The product just didn't work for our baby. I am trying Mom to Mom generic brand instead to see if it helps with his constipation. The generic brands are much cheaper anyway.
4,Good buy Good for baby,"I switched from Similac to Good Start when my son was 2 momth old because of the recent recall and my son's worsening reflux. I tried other brands too, but my friend recommended it since her son with reflux benefitted from Good Start. So far it's been good. It has very little foam unlike Costco's brand and it mixes well. The special gentle whey protein must be helpful; my son burps fast and digests well. No foul smell. Now's he grew out of reflux. The only thing I don't is how i need to punch out the formula scoop out of this circular plastic shape and the lid doesn't have the scoop holder to keep it dry and away from touching the formula. But, my husband and I are careful and it's only a mere inconvenience."
5,The Best For My Baby Girl!!,"I'm a first time mom with a baby girl and when she was in the hospital she would drink similac advanced because we had a problem with the latching. Long story made short i've tried similac advance. organic, isomil, soy, she was so constipated but not to the point of suppositories. A friend of mines told me about nestle good start and it being closer to breast milk. It was such a drastic improvement over night. She loves it, and i love it because she loves it."
4,Costs too much!,"My son was having problems digesting Enfamil, so my pediatrician recommended that we try Good Start. We've been using the Gentle Plus for about a month now and his throwing up has decreased drastically. He does so much better on this formula. However, Amazon has it priced too high. I buy it at Target for $21/25.7oz and at HEB for $22.50/25.7oz. I'm surprised because usually I find that Amazon has the lowest price - especially when items are bulked into packs as this one is."
5,"Item: Gomer Pyle, USMC","I've enjoyed the television programs featuring this particular title! In fact I now have all the DVD's of Gomer Pyle, USMC! I had the book a long while back and decided that I wanted it back on my bookshelf. Soo I checked it out with Amazon and lo and behold, they had it! 0f course I purchased it and enjoy browsing through it!"
3,Enoyable and sexy,"Three Nights is an enjoyable, sexy historical romance. Perfect for a day at the beach or a long winter evening. It is predictable. They spend three nights together so you know at least three things: they're gonna fall in love, they're gonna be separated, and with no contraception...Even knowing that, the character of Lucien was appealing and there are occassional surprises in the subplot."
4,Quick Read,This is one of those books that you remember for quite a while after you finish reading it. There were some really great emotional moments that were unforgettable. I found it very endearing that Lucien was so worried about Aveline being repulsed by his scars. I just wanted to give him a big hug to reassure him. Very cute. This was just a simple romance without any great conflicts.
2,Meh,"From the description, the novel should be everything I love in a romance...H/h separate, secret baby, natural trust issues from the situation....it just wasn't very good. I had to make myself keep reading, because the h was unlikeable, the main friction was pretty pointless, the plot was weak with very little foreshadowing and the child didn't seem very important to the h or the H. I rarely spend this much on Kindle books and I am somewhat mad that I did."
5,Dreamy,"This is my favorite trance CD. The tracks create dreamlike states which are soothing and energizing, and they vary enough to be interesting. If you enjoy traveling beyond your usual consciousness, the potential is here via music alone."
3,nice textbook for the real estate agent,"enjoyed this textbook, but it neds the kind of higher level finance routines found in books by professor tirone and mr. coffin."
4,A great stepping stone into the Real Estate world.,"As a teacher in pre-liscence Real Estate, I can highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting into Real Estate. Some critics have said that the book may need a better math section, but you should remember that the book is designed to help you pass your exam and not intended as your sole training outlet. Anyone reading & studying this work has covered the material needed for exam purposes. The rest is usually left up to the Broker or experience to teach. I find the book to be extremely helpful in my classes."
4,The first album of the popular 80's group is very enjoyable.,"THE HURTING introduced the rock group Tears For Fears to the United States. Although this album has aged the least well of Tears For Fears' other work, it is still pleasant to listen to, especially if you liked the music of the 80s. Songs like ""Mad World,"" ""Pale Shelter,"" and ""Change"" helped define the group's sound for the next decade, and even after nearly fifteen years, still have the power to move the listener. THE HURTING is a good beginning for one of the 80's most beloved acts. END"
5,Calling all '80s alternative rock fans!,"This is an awesome album. I first bought the cassette tape in 1985 after listening to their ""Songs from the Big Chair"".. I recently purchased the CD. A must buy for all those alternative rock fans!"
5,Essential 80s,TFFs debut album is essential 80s new wave. This album serves as a blueprint to all their music. Intelligent synth pop with heartfelt lyrics. Maybe one day we could get a 2 cd deluxe reissue as well to really give this classic album justice !
4,Hurts so good,"It is awfully hard to dismiss TFF's important debut amongst early electro-pop's greatest efforts. Coming through startlingly fresh still despite heavy doses of retro production and dated equipment, Hurting excels at taking the cold harsh textures of early electronica and fusing it with something far more melodically human."
4,Brought back memories,"I heard the promo for the new X-Box game ""gears of war"" and said to myself, ""I know that song!"" Sure enough, after some before work googling I figured out that it was Tears for Fears a group that I listened to quite a bit back in the '80s, the track ""Mad World"". I went ahead and purchased this, received it in a week and quickly ripped it to my computer. I've been listening to tracks from this album ever since on my mp3 player. A good trip down memory lane!"
4,Where's that speed adjust knob...,"Am I hallucinating, or are the tracks a bit sped up from the unremastered version? The production is a bit crisper, but the speed thing makes me wanna buy back my original. Anyone know where I can find out? Two listenings haven't changed my mind... Also, they need to put that picture of the boy on the inside and bring back the shot of Roland and Curt by the water, which graced the cover of the 1983 tape and vinyl, and which is now relegated to a B&W insert."
5,my fav tears album,"This is by far there best work. They were more creative sounding on this album. stand out songs the hurting, change."
4,Healing the Hurting,"For anyone who was ever denied love as a child... Lonely children, wounded children, violated children, sorrowful children, discarded children... Too intelligent and insightful to be considered ""pop,"" this album belongs with psychology books on healing childhood abuse, not with cool 80s dance music. If there were a category for healing, literary concept albums, this would be in the top 10. Sometimes just hearing your feelings expressed by another, knowing you're not alone in the dark, can be all the therapy you need. Give this one to someone still hurting."
4,Sad electro-pop at it's best!,"Tears for Fears is one of my favorite bands that emerged from the 80's scene. I would call these two lads gloom rockers! I enjoyed their mixture of sad heartfelt lyrics with the emerging electronic music scene. The Hurting in my opinion even though simple was their best CD (album) that they released, and though their follow ups are great they miss the innocence that The Hurting captured."
1,Disappointing,"The advertising for this product is not reliable. I found the off brand ""yoga toes"" to lack the flexibility that is necessary for a comfortable fit. They were difficult to place over the toes and wouldn't stay on. I sent them right back and ordered the real thing."
1,Not as good as the brand name,"I purchased the brand name first and was very happy with it. If you have bunions, etc. this help your foot. I've lost my Yoga toes and decided to purchase the cheaper version. The cheaper one are not as flexible and uncomfortable. I will buy again the brand name."
1,flexible yoga toes,These may have helped IF I were able to actually spread my toes enough to fit in the holes. They should come in a smaller size for female feet.
5,Stretching your dollars and toes!,"I thought I'd give this a shot since they looked just like a very similar product i had recently seen in a catalog for more than 3 times the price. I figured I didn't have that much to lose if I didn't like them, and I would NOT have spent $36 on them (catalog price). Surprise...I like them! They are easy to use and the stretch feels good. One word of caution, though - I'm not sure if the online product description mentioned this, but if you are diabetic or have circulation problems, the instructions recommend consulting your doctor before using. I bought my Mom a pair for Xmas and THEN we asked her podiatrist if she could use them. She is diabetic, and he thought she should pass. At least they weren't $36!"
4,flexible yoga toes,these do exactly what they say they do..my toes have become a little more flexible since buying them
3,careful with size you choose,"I mistakenly thought a ""large"" meant the size between the toes not the size of the foot. I still can use them, but they are awkward.Candace"
4,not bad for the price,"it looks like the real version would be softer on the feet, these are a little hard - don't try to walk around with them but they do work. they are a little big but you can push them down onto your toes and they will stay."
2,unsure of your product,I had one brfore for several years and it really didn't do what it should have doneYours may be headed in the same direction I have used it several times including during the night while sleeping(kind of)!! also several days for as long as 8 hrs.and once or twice longer.bob
4,it works!,"I use them to relieve pain from bunions and Morton's neuroma. If I care to spend 5 minutes fitting them perfectly on my very imperfect toes before going to sleep, they stay on for at least 30 min and I wake up with my whole feet refreshed. They usually slip off when I wake up but it works for me! Sure beats surgery and other expensive treatments!"
3,"Hey, I'm a Pastafarian!","Long a fan of The Flying Spaghetti Monster, I had to get this item. I wear it every day. It's inexpensive, but sturdy. Sadly, it doesn't turn my neck green, but only the FSM is truly perfect, so...buy it!"
5,Soothing moist heat,"I purchased this for my mother who was experiencing discomfort in her shoulders due to arthritis. My own doctor had recommended moist heat, so I was glad to find this compress. When I recently saw my mother, I saw she had the compress on a table near her microwave. I asked her if she used the compress. She says she uses it very often. It has provided a great deal of relief for her. Maybe I'll get one for myself!"
5,for those who love rock and roll.,"fans of the replacements should love this cd, fans of garage rock should love this cd, fans of great music period should love this cd. this is a recording bursting with enthusiasm, energy and great hooks. a 100% rock and roll winner."
4,Why the hate,"This album is simply what it is, a well done cover album. Silk has done all of these tracks justice. No one is suggesting that they are as good as the originals nor will they ever replace the original versions but this is a good sidestep to hear classic tunes with a different spin. Too many reviewers here are acting as if by covering Always and Forever it will make Heatwave's version go away. That will NEVER happen so enjoy this for what it is and stop acting as if a crime has been committed. Boys II Men did a cover album (Throwback)and the earth is still spinning. Prince even covered the Stlystics. I'm just glad Silk is still out there and look forward to their next work, cover album or not."
5,"SILKY SMOOTH, NOTHIN'S CHANGED","I loved the CD overall. Most impressive was Jon Jon's Prince impersonation I'll call it of 'Adore.' He more than has the chops to fool anyone who didn't know better. I think Silk shines when they are themselves and not conscious of trying to pass them selves off at times as the originals...where they are the most successful I think are ""They'll Never Be"" and ""The Lady In My Life."" ""Secret Garden"" is pretty painful. Like ""Nite and Day"" and ""Don't Disturb"" they were too songs that in my opinion just DON'T lend themselves out for reinterpretation...WHOEVER the culprit is.I haven't been able to stop playing this one. I disagree with the first critique of the LP. I think he's being a bit harsh but, we all have different ears I guess.My only other tidbit is I did like the new interpretation of ""Sideshow"" and glad they decided to revisit that track.SILK forever!!!!!"
4,get this one,"i don't know what charles l. hubbert is talking about, but he got it all wrong, if he does reviews for a living, he needs to be fired, any way, this is a good cd, i have never brought a silk cd until this one, and what got me was the remakes, i was very much impress, i think they should have left ""there never be"" by switch alone, i think u will skip over that, but the others, high props, ""always and forever"" will almost bring water to your eyes they did it so good, u will find yourself going back down memory lane with this cd, i find it to sound better in the car than in the house, get this cd, u will love it, bet that."
1,A bad Five Heartbeats comeback.....,"I must admmit, I was really excited to hear good old Silk from the 90's come back (kind of like the new Boys 2 Men), however, once I heard the first track.....I became very disappointed.The good thing about classic R&B; is that they are timeless and really don't need other renditions, especially bad ones. So, Silk should have known better, that's just like Willy Hong making recreating ""Freak Me""---BAD, BAD, BAD.Like my husband said...someone should start a class action suit against Silk for this album."
1,A mockery of Jo Beverley's true style and capabilities,"Eleanor was a simpering fool, who ruined the entire book. Nicholas was almost as bad. But Eleanor takes the cake for the most distasteful, idiotic, and annoying character ever created. I am disappointed in this aimless and pithy story. Where on earth is Rothgar's story? I am dying of impatience- I don't want anymore of these reproductions of lame old stories when the last Malloren story is not out there to make all of us happy. Hopefully Jo Beverley will not disappoint me again with another superficial attempt at romance."
3,2.5 stars,"I was enjoying this book at first. It was different from the average romance read and I appreciated that. It started to lose it's appeal after a while though. The heroine didn't seem too bright and I just lost interest in rooting for her. I also was not convinced that hero fell in love with her. They didn't seem to spend enough time with each other, and he was definitely too worldy for her. They did not make a good couple.In the end things didn't come together as I would have liked. Loose ends were not tied up the right way. I know some readers will disagree with me, but the situation with the baby did not turn out to be a happy one for me. Therefore, it left me with an unfulfilled feeling. I will admit though that if you want to read something a little different from the romance novels out there now, this book is unique in that way. I gave it 2.5 stars because it was interesting enough to finish."
4,Really enjoyed this,I really enjoyed this story. Definitely recommend if you like to read this genre of book. Just 4 more words...
2,"not one of jo's best, i'm afraid...","An Arranged Marriage is one of Beverley's earlier works, which, as far as I have seen, aren't as good as her more recent works. This book was rather slow-going and lacked any good scenes (e.g. funny ones that make you laugh out loud as you read or tear-jerking ones). The characters are good, but need to be developed more. I'm interested in seeing her next sequels to see if her writing style improves. Note that this is a reissued work that was written earlier, but her later works are much better..."
5,a definite keeper--worth more than 5 stars,"An Arranged Marriage is a wonderful book. The characters are well drawn and memorable;the story will hold your interest. Nicholas and Eleanor are two of my favorite characters--especially Nicholas! It is one of the best books I have ever read and is a story one can read again and again. The Regency setting is glittering and complex and Jo brings it to life brilliantly. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes strong, memorable characters, romance, intrigue and the Regency period. It is also the first book in the Company of Rogues series. Great job, Jo!"
1,Cheating is NOT romantic,"Hmmm...This is a book based on rape an adultery. How romantic! Geeze, this is what makes me feel warm inside! Did I forget the part about the abandonment...Golly how sweet."
1,"Sorry, just didn't like this book","I believe there must be two different people writing under the name Jo Beverely. Out of all her books, the only set I can recommend is the Mallorens. I have read and re-read that series and I'm desperately waiting for Rothgar's story.In her re-released book, An Arranged Marriage, how can anyone like the supposed hero. Poor Nicholas, he must sleep with a woman, other than his wife, to save his country. Sorry, I don't feel anything for Nicholas but disgust and pitty for Eleanor. Not my definition of a good romance book. They can be notorious rakes before they meet, but once married - hands off the rest. This book is going back to the second hand book store."
2,Hummm,"I am just not sure of this book. I enjoyed reading it, but had a problem with it almost from the beginning. I know that Elenore's life was pretty bad, but she went along alittle too easily with marring a guy who raped her. And then once she marries, she accepts the ""mistress"" much too easily. And for much too long. And the hero was not a decent guy no matter that he was doing ""it"" for the greater good. Please!! It was all too unbelievable for me. I won't be keeping this book."
1,"Romance between the hero and the ""other"" woman","If you want the angst, the frustration and like doormat heroines, this book is for you. The hero must spend most of the book cheating on the poor, little wifey (heroine) with another woman (his mistress) for the sake of his country.Despite the tasteless, vomit inducing adultery theme, she might have been able to pull this off if the book was more focused on the 2 main characters. Unfortunately, this book's main focus was the hero and the other woman. The heroine's part seemed like a side story, part of his reward for sleeping with his mistress through out the book. I never felt like I knew the heroine and the ""saint"" hero was a one big (jack-arse) martyr. He saves the heroine by marrying her, then sleeps with the mistress to save his country. Oh puh-lease.... *rolls eyes* When did they have the time to fall in love, and what was there to love? Their HEA was completely unbelievable.This book should be categorized as a ""romance novel for men""."
2,I wish it were better,"Beverly is a good writer (within the romance level of prosaic expectation). She has issues she seems to work through in her novels involving violence, and that's important. This book isn't as disturbing as _An Unwilling Bride_; for one thing, the hero is far more likeable. But if it wants to deal with homophobia, then it should do so directly to help us address the horrid rape that opens the novel...and, most egregiously, closes the novel as well. The hero and heroine casually chatting about her rape as he has his hand inside her gown? What kind of demons are you exorcising, Ms. Beverley?If you want to read Beverley's novels, leap to _Hazard_ or _My Lady Notorious_. I wish I could now read her novels without having this mess and, even worse, _An Unwilling Bride_ forever in my mind."
1,The worst book I have EVER read,"Well, someone ""kindly"" included this book with another I had purchased off of Amazon as a ""gift""....and I wish I had never ever read it. If I could give it negative stars I would. I actually read it maybe a year and a half ago and it still nauseates me. The rape, the adultery, I would have jumped off the bridge myelf and taken my unborn child with me. Ugh! I could MAYBE have gotten over the adultery, I mean he WAS ordered to do it after all....but the rape?? Forget it. No way no how. I wish I had never read this book, it honestly makes me want to cry (and not in a good way!)"
2,Disappointing,"I want sensuality and lots of sex in romances, but prefer to read about it between the hero and the heroine, not the hero and his mistress. This book might as well be about them! I realize most men did have mistresses back then, but find it hard to believe that a wife who loved her husband that much would swallow it so easily. Still, I like this writer very much and look forward to future books from her."
5,The Best of the Rogues,"I loved Nicholas, he was a subtle hero, handsome and gifted and tortured by his affair with his enemy. I didn't like it when he had to go to her, but I understood why he did it. This is the best of the lot, with An Unwilling Bride a close second."
3,not what I expected,"I was very excited to receive my Chitosan in the mail; couldn't wait to get started. I took two in the morning before breakfast and two in the afternoon before dinner. I lost about 2.5 pounds in two weeks. I was expecting to lose more, but I guess this is the healthy way to lose weight. I can say that it did make me feel fuller faster."
5,amazing,"Few books have taken me for such a wonderful ride as this one. You can get the plot from the publishers blurb. I found the story engaging, provocative, and rich. I thought the prose was elegant."
3,Can't Get a Picture to Fit or Stay Put,My wife likes the pendant although we can't figure out how to get a picture to stay in there. It didn't come with directions and this is our first locket.
3,Nice...but how do you get the picture in there?????!,"It's a nice piece of jewelery for my 1 year old to give his mother for Christmas, but after I managed to get a picture made small enough for a locket (not as easy as you would think), there is no way to really fit it in there. I had to cut the picture into the shape of the locket as best I could and jam it in there. Who knows if it will just fall right out over time. We shall see."
4,Cab please!,NOw this was mybe the first cabaret voltaire record i bought when it came out. And what a revelation it was. This was in some ways very commercial but also very very experimental. They were trying to leave the minimalist days behind them and produced this massively beautiful electronic record where they mix dance tracks with weird experimental stuff.
2,Blurry hope,"2 1/2While plenty of people commented that the reason why most seek this out in the first place is in fact a false one, it is hard to fault listeners for being duped into thinking this might have been a full-on Sigur Ros ambient soundtrack; the also-Icelandic composer parallels quite a few production aesthetics found in the band's softer, more introspective moments (You can hear the Hilmarsson's influence in their next disc ""()"" immensely), making for a somber, if shallow experience."
2,TOO challenging,"this was a little too much for me. i love all of sigur ros' albums (i even have von) but this...it's like going to the opera. it's that boring. basically, if you're into classical music, this is definitly great. i'm not denying talent here. sigur ros and whoever this other group is are both awesome on this cd musically, but it's not my thing.what i'm saying is this: just because you like sigur ros doesn't mean you're going to like this. be careful here. (it is cheap though, if you want it for collection purposes)"
4,Strong Debut,"Rhonda Clark has a strong voice and good material to work with on this release. She was on TABU records, and like most of their artist her stuff is out of print. She worked with the JIMMY JAM AND TERRY LEWIS camp on this release.The first single ""State of Attraction"" made the r&b; TOP 20 on radio play alone. The seductive ballad ""Stay here, Stay near"" will capture you from beginning to end. She starts out in a low sexy voice and then rips the ending as she only could! ""Sugar"" is another standout ballad on this release.Other good songs of note are ""Does that make a man?"" in which she belts ""its not your car. its not your money. im asking you. does that make a man?"". The funky ""I love your body"" finds her being straight forward about her admiration for a lover's physique and all the things she wants to do to it! Sexy.Rhonda Clark suffered from a record company going down and no promotion. Another diamond in the rough! This is a balanced record. Good 90's r&b;."
4,AQUAMAN8,This is a super recording & I really don't know why it's not on CD yet! It's a groovy cd to play at wedding receptions... & to get your swerve-on before the bedroom battle begins...! I'll say no mo'!!
4,it should be heard,it is a nice choice if you want to listen turkish ryhtim with popular words.Now he reaches a very top point in france pop list.And he is expected to be in the first place
5,SOMEONE HAS A BAD ATTITUDE ABOUT TARKAN!,"... I love this particular CD because I used to live in Turkey and I knew EVERY song on this album. The lyrics are sentuous and thoughtful and I admire his creativity. I say ""GO TARKAN!"" Take America and the rest of the world! Many (not all as we can already see) will admire you and love your music, as I do. I and many others are looking forward to the release of your English cross-over album!"
4,An interesting fellow,I had hoped for more info on Pike's involvement in the Indian Territories during the Civil War. There is a lot of good information about the man's life. The actual book has the consistancy of a phone book
2,Nothing Special,"Somehow I expect more. This is an average run-of-the mill album of classic turn of the century songs. They are done competently but lack any real excitement. Somehow I wanted a more authentic sound, but that's not what's here."
1,So-called 'parts therapy' harms.,"The era of parts therapy/DID/MPD and 'repressed memory therapy' is over. Dead. But unfortunately, it didn't end soon enough for the many innocent victims and their families who were caught in its wake and harmed by it."
1,Not for me,"I have no connection to Ireland or Veronica Guerin, but I was curious to read this book when the movie was announced a few years ago. I actually found it to be quite porrly put together, not quite as balanced as the other reviewer.Having little to no knowledge of the situation beyond what O'Reilly provides, I found her purported insights into the media pretty banal. And it is infrequent that I read a journalistic account whose authorial voice I found quite as unlikeable."
5,Why Was China Crisis Ignored in the States???...,"I hate to even call this simply a pop album from mid 80's from an obscure group;It's anything but.It's a mixture of rich experimental global rhythms that not only bring to mind Steely Dan (like other reviewers noted) but also contains faint doses of General Public and Tears For Fears;you hear the music,try to pinpoint where you've heard something like this before, but just can't. This is the kind of admirable musical artistry that a lot of new groups lack today and that I miss. China Crisis is not calculated or contrived in any of their tracks;They seem to go with their gut instinct which works every time...Their later projects contained a more soft pop,jazz-like ambient sound ( 1989's Diary of A Hollow Horse)..."
4,BRING ON THA NOIZE!,"I have loved ice-t's music since he first album and when he crossed over to hard rock/metal, I was blown away. This dvd is raw and pretty at the same time, showcasing a lot of their hit songs, including kkk bitch and cop killer. If you are a fan or just love hard music, this is a must."
5,Ideal blanket,"I am obsessed with this blanket. We recieved the pink one as a gift, and have used it for about 7 months now. It is super-soft and velvety, and with the satin trim, is down-right gorgeous. It is a great weight for cold nights or strolls. It has held up wonderfully, and looks just as new as it did when we recieved it. I love this blanket- I wish they made adult sizes! I predict our daughter will be using it for years to come."
4,"Great oils, Amazon sticker annoying","I've used these oils before and they are absolutely wonderful. However, I ordered this trio for a friend's birthday and was unhappy with the Amazon sticker put smack-dab in the middle of the top of the box. I tried to carefully peel it off which made things just as bad! The box was designed to be suitable for a gift, but Amazon ruined that option!!!"
3,Worked Out Well,"I believe that the oils worked out well and kept a good shelf life. However, I saw this 3 pack of oil in the grocery store right after I purchased this on Amazon and at the store it was considerably cheaper. I don't know if that is still true, but you might want to check your local groceries for the price before you purchase on Amazon."
4,"Great flow, wonderful history and terrific pictures",The history on each bike discribed in the book is quite informative. The bikes we were specifically interested in are the Bonnevilles and there is no shortage of great pictures and descriptions. There are some great examples of restorations that go beyond showroom quality. We are especially fond of the 1977 Silver Jubilee edition.
4,Add this one to your Hospice and Palliative Care library.,"Dying Well by Ira Byock, MD is a must read for all professionals who want to learn more about end of life care, Thanatology, or Hospice and Palliative Care. I will be sharing this one with all my colleages."
3,Was looking for resources to help my mother,During the final months and days of my mother's life I was looking for guidance and words of wisdom to make her passing as pain free and peaceful as possible. This book did have some good information that was useful.
4,Dying Well,"I purchased this book to read via my smartphone. At the time, my mother-in-law was very ill and under hospice home health care. The book offered me information on how to deal with the emotions of our family's crisis. Knowing the book was written by a doctor, who discovered for himself the daily end-of-life care needed when a loved one is at that stage, was reassuring that he knew what he was talking about. It was helpful to know options, ""normal"" concerns, and what to look for during the last few days. Thank you."
5,A Have-To Read,"Having had the privilege of walking through the passing of my mother and grandmother with home hospice care, and now accompanying my dad through palliative care for extreme neuropathic pain from a spinal cord injury, and with a social work background and seminary training, I cannot say enough about this book. It is an incredibly engaging book; yes it is hard to read. Yes I cried in a number of places. The writing itself moves you; Ira Byock clearly is championing a critical part of our healthcare, especially as so many Americans are in or will soon enter stages of aging and end of life. Please read this book. It is the best preparation for a most difficult but most precious and sacred time of life, for us and for our loved ones."
3,Wasn't what I expected...,This book was not quite what I expected. Was hoping for a little more advise on helping a loved one through the dying process. Some good stories.
4,Great Read,We used this book for our minimester about death and dying. Applies very well with the class and every day life.
5,Powerfully honest & deeply human view of death & hospice,"As I was struggling through the final months of my mother's life, I stumbled across this inspired book. At some points it was so brutally honest and raw in its assessment of death and hospice issues that I could barely read on, but I felt compelled to. Byock has a rare and valid perspective that deserves discussion--preferably before you are faced with the imminent death of a loved one."
2,Below Average,"I bought this at Bestbuy, was OK for about an year, then suddenly stopped working, I never over used it nor misused it. May be thats its life period, better buy someother model."
1,CLOGS CLOGS AND MORE CLOGS!!!,You have to use a vacuum cleaner to clean the clogs out of the hose. And you think you got the clog.. but ohhhh no.. there is more up there!!
2,"No suction, pain in the rear","I haven't seemed to have any luck with ANY vacuums from Hoover lately. This is my third in three years (the least expensive too) and short of the $400 one catching on fire in less than 2 months, this is the worst. Poor suction, tools are not helpful at all, the dustbin is clumsy to take off and reinstall and the filter throws dust everywhere when you yank it out.Don't buy this vaccuum!"
3,Review from Consumer Reports,"I logged onto Consumer reports and here's the review they gave"" Excelled at most cleaning, but noisy. Tippy with hose extended. Cord less convenient to wrap than others. Hose and power cord shorter than most. Had to bend to adjust rug height. Bag: $2.90. ""They gave it a Very Good rating with anExcellent rating for Cleaning carpets, Cleaning bare floors, emissionsVery Good rating for cleaning with tools.and a POOR rating for Noise."
1,Worthless Vacuum,"Not my personal review >> While thinking about buying this, I did some search and found this review at http://www.epinions.com/content_136231423620>>> ""BARELY ANY SUCTION, hose has ABSOLUTELY NO SUCTION, doesn't pick up anything, clogs easily, squeaks.You would think being a Hoover, and at $70, this vacuum would atleast be average. It's not. I feel as if Hoover did not even test this model before they put it on the market. The suction is really really bad. It won't even pick up staples. Works average on dust, fine dirt and dog hair. Hose attachments are POINTLESS... they have no suction at all. Also... the one I have squeaks when you move it... like the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard.I am completely serious when I say DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM!""Also read reviews for Hoover U5150-900 Tempo Upright Bagless Vacuum, Persian Purple, same product but different color, also being sold at Amazon.comAfter reading this, I'm not buying it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have owned this vacuum about a year. It seemed to work fine in the beginning, then it started to fall apart. I only use it on three area rugs. I replaced at least 4 belts, and the on/off switch is not working correctly. The suction is terrible and leaves a path of dirt. I dislike the bagless system and it seems like I have to constantly empty and clean the filters. I am going back to a bag/canister as soon as I figure out which one to choose."
1,Garbage,This vacuum is a piece of plastic garbage that is now polluting our Earth in a landfill somewhere rather than cleaning my floors. It ALWAYS needed cleaning and the belt broke several times. I bought an Oreck to replace it and that has not needed one repair since I bought it over one year ago.
5,KYB 341330 GR-2 Shock,"I needed new shocks for my car. Several quotes from local repair shops quoted $160+ per shock. After doing research, I found these KYB shocks on Amazon. This particular shock 341330 does fit a 2004 Honda Accord as the front replacements. I'd recommend checking KYB's online catalog to verify the correct part for your car.On to the actual review. The replacements were installed by a local mechanic as I didn't have the tools needed. The price of this part on Amazon is superior to what I found shopping at local repair shops plus free 2 day shipping and no sales tax. The shocks themselves make a huge difference in the ride of the car. I didn't realize how bad my old shocks were until I rode in 4 new shocks. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and feel of the new shocks. The ride is smooth and bumps are not nearly as rough on my car."
5,Looking good,"The data port easily snaps into place and is held securely, and the results look great (no obvious seams or anything like that)."
5,Worked like a charm,"The Leviton connector snaps right in and once mounted you'd have no idea that it was two pieces. Plus, it's easier to work with just the connector piece when attaching the cat5 cable."
5,Dopeness!,"Zion I is dope, straight up. This is the first album by the 2 man group consisting of Zion and Amp Live as the MC and the Producer. You know, its rare to find a 2 man group that colaborate so well that it will send chills through your body. What I like most about this group and especially this album, is that they dont care about getting exposure or making it 1 on the pop-charts. They experiment with creative sounds, drums, synths, and lyrics that they dont care if people like it or not, their gonna do what they like and they do it damn well! The versatality of this album is insane, uptempo, down-tempo, hiphop, R&B, electronic, drum & bass. Theres a standout track titled ""Elevation"", This is honestly one of the best songs I have heard in my entire career in hiphop as a listener. You defenately have to get this one in your CD stack."
5,Seriously On Point!,"This creative project is lyrically rich, musically diverse and socially conscious. Lyrics complex but comprehendable. This is definately a timeless project that will last test of time. Hopefully, the reality of the lyrics won't be long lasting but Zion I's reflection is quite vivid and clear. They are taking RAP to another level and I definately will purchase more of their lyrical gifts, True & Livin is my next but Street Legends is their most recent (2007), eventually I will get them all. This is message music."
4,introspective,"Zion I is one of the most thoughtful, inspired, and intelligent emcee's out there. His philosophy and thoughts combined with an ill flow make him easily one of the more underrated names in the hip hop game.Unique and creative production is Zion I's gift and his curse. While the beats brought forth in songs such as ""rap degreez"", ""trippin"", ""one"" ""silly puddy"", ""elevation"" and ""inner light"" show zion i behind some of the sickest beats i have ever heard...tracks such as ""critical"" ""koncrete jungle"" and especially ""how many"" show this creativity taken in the wrong direction. this album could have been a five star effort if more time would have been spend editing, and removing some of these tracks.fav tracks: one, revolution, silly puddy,"
5,If You Say/ I Will Say,"As always Christopher you say and sing the right things. My name is Mon'ja and I have been admring you sine the first debut album CW. I have followed your success every step of the way, from the big screen to the on stage productions. Men Cry In The Dark is my all time high, WELCOME BACK BABY!, it was so good to see you again, and the song I Am Yours, left me speechless and praying for another cd of love songs.PS: Chris how does a woman keep in touch?, a fan mail address or web site would be appreciated."
2,Not much of a science project.,"This is really more of a craft project than anything.It involves painting the ""Milk Carton"" and gluing onstickers.It is not a radio assembly project, which is what I waslooking for. No soldering or anything - it comes as a sealedfinished project that you decorate with the included supplies.It's fine if that is what you are looking for, but if youwant an electronics project look elsewhere."
3,None,the kindle sample consists only of an introduction and acknowledgements. please include at least one tale since it is a book of tales... or else just dont have a sample
5,Hefty Trash Compacter Bags,"I am thrilled with these bags. We previously used a similar bag purchased at Cosco, but the size of that bag was reduced. We couldn't stretch the bag enough to fit our compacter. These bags are slightly larger and fit perfectly. Fast service from merchant too. Thanks."
5,Hefty Compactor Bags,"Very good product. What I really want to point out is that you don't get 12 bags in a pack of 12, but 12 x 5 = 60 bags."
2,Compactor bags have more packaging,These are strong bags. We have used them in the past and like their size and durability. I don't like getting 5 per box. I liked the older packaging which gave you 25 or 50 per box.
5,Moving Beyond Words!,"As a person who reads 3 to 5 usually non-fiction books a week, I like to think of myself as knowledgable and well-informed. However, after reading Watch for Me on the Mountain, I realized how ignorant I have been about Geronimo and the Apaches in spite of all of my reading about native Americans. The details and descriptions in this book transport you to another time and place full of characters whom you learn to love. Foremost among them is Geronimo. His brilliant battle strategies that are studied by the military today are fascinating and exciting to read about. His religious beliefs are so close to my own and so beautifully expressed that I found myself hoping that I meet him in a future lifetime. This is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read. What a hidden gem! No one recommended this book to me. I found it at a national park bookstore. I can't wait to read it to my students!"
3,"A few versions of this out there, get the 4 tracker","The 4 track cd is worth getting if your after all the cake singles. Firstly it comes in a jewel case which is more durable than the non-gloss cardboard sleeve version.The tracks for this cd are:1. the Distance2. Multiply the Heartaches3. Jolene (livel)4. It's Coming DownAn ok single just for the live version of Jolene, otherwise you get 2 album songs and Multiply the Heartaches which is one of those semi-country sounding songs. the 2 Bsides are not found on Bside and Rarities making this the only way to get those tracks. So overall not a bad buy for Jolene."
5,When convenience is essential,"For travelling, or just when in a rush, and the baby is howling, these cans allow a quick and easy feeding. Not to be used all the time, as they are too costly."
3,dented cans,"my cans were delivered completely damaged, they were ALL dented, and I had to throw them away. It is common knowledge that dented cans of food build bacteria inside. I lost my money and my faith in ordering this item from you again."
4,"Apparently better tasting, but hard to find","I was trying to switch my son from breastmilk to formula as I was expecting to return to work, but he would not take Enfamil or Similac, the regular versions, soy, etc etc. We literally tried every type we could find in the store. Finally when I spoke to our pediatrician, she chuckled ""Of course he won't take Enfamil or Similac. They all taste like cardboard compared to breastmilk."" and then she recommended Good Start.I had never heard of it before but based on her recommendation, I tried it. Maybe my baby just gave up at that point, but for whatever reason, he started drinking it from the first try.The only downside is that it is more difficult to find in stores compared to Enfamil or Similac. Of course you can always order online but when you're in a tight spot (like when you're counting down the number of remaining cans while you're waiting for your latest order to arrive), it can be a little nerve racking..."
3,"Cute, cute, cute...","I bought this set and the one with two flowers for my daycare about a month ago. I had never heard of them, but I thought they were so cute I had to give them a chance. I love the way they look on the wall in the daycare and the kids love to take them down and play with them. They are extremely cute and I feel like the actual pieces are well made. The music player in them is very cheap and hard to hear, when it's working, the one in the airplane already stopped working. I will probably order a few more sets, even though I was not impressed with the sound. I like them for the way they look and that is reason enough for me to buy more."
1,Just buy the album,If you have deb's first album..than dont bother buying this. All it has is a radio edit(3.58)..there is probably a longer version on the album. U may also need to buy a new case for it. when i opened mine all the plastic that the cd holds onto crumbled. oh well.
1,Very bad movie,"This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen and the worst example of a ""sort of musical"". Even if you are an Adrian Paul fan, don't waste your money."
2,"Looks good, but top lid is weak, difficult to latch","This item looks very nice with shining aluminum frames as shown in picture. The foam inside is thick and good quality. The top lid bends very easily especially near the middle handle, probably because it is very long (53 inches) with little frame support, and supported mainly by plastic panels only. It is a little tough to align the top and bottom latch to lock. I had to bend the lid so it will latch with the bottom half. You may unlatch by push in the plastic panel with your thumb; it is not very strong."
1,Stay away.,The author has this all wrong. The Cubs and Red Sox deserve books of poety. The Yankees deserve annual reports.
1,USELESS!!!!,"If you're thinking that anything in this book is better than the stuff on the internet, let me save you some money!!!! There is NO REASONE WHATSOEVER to buy this book!! If warner brothers printed many of these, they're either going to have to give them away, or recoupe their costs by recycling them to print something worthwhile."
2,Rush tab anthology,"I bought this book because of old good songs. I thought the tab comes with complete songs and solos, and it did not. Poor tab edition."
1,The Worst TAB Book I've Ever Bought,"An utter waste of time and money. I don't know what they were thinking when they put this together (or what Rush's management was thinking either). Most of the songs simply transcribe the vocal melodies for guitar (why, I have no idea) while providing (sometimes accurate, sometimes not) chord charts.Then, randomly, there are a couple of songs with complete, full tab transcriptions, like Broon's Bane and YYZ. But even then, the notation is bad. For instance, given all the complexity in YYZ, it never notes hammer-ons and pull-offs. It just gives you the notes for you to figure out yourself. You're much better off taking your chances with online tabs."
3,Please include song listing,I don't own this guitar book. But I do own the guitar anthology book. I think I'd like to get this one but Amazon doesn't have the song listing included so I don't know if it's any different. When I can actually see what songs are included I might buy it. Thanks Amazon.
1,"I never got it, I got a credit to my credit card","I guess they misrepresented the product listed for the price listed. However, they rapidly credited my purchase so no harm no foul. The only reason I state one star is because I had to pick one. Since I didn't receive anything I couldn't really rate it."
5,Adorable,My daughter loves animals...Everytime she learns about a new animal and sees it at the zoo or the aquarium or on TV. And she seems interested in the aminal we get her a little stuffed animal. She loves them
2,Suitable more for kids than adults,"It is not the book to purchase if you want to build stadium jumps (brush box, coops, panels) - there is some information on building cross country jumps, but there is a lack of detail and no step-by-step instructions."
1,Complete waste of money,"This is not a ""book"", this is barely even a ""pamphlet"". Complete waste of money!"
2,title is misleading,"The books in this series are usually quite good, however, this particular title is misleading. There is no actual construction of jumps, but a collection of types of jumps for a course. This book seems nearly a duplicate of designing a jump course. I was disappointed."
1,Pass on this book...,"It shows several examples of different jumps but no detailed directions. It does provide some helpful tips for constucting cross country jumps but not much. Check out ""Jumps, etc."" by Lisa Campbell or ""Building Show Jumps"" by Andy Radford.Good Luck..."
2,Poorly Conceived DVD,If you do not speak Spanish and need English subtitles - they do not work on the DVD.
3,CYMA Mac-11 Laser Light Airsoft Review,"Ok let's start out...... I was excited when I first received this - the shipping was pretty much on time, pretty quick.BUT, when me and my Dad were putting the track rails on, the red dot sight on, and the flashlight on IT WAS VERY HARD TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE NOT WRITTEN BY SOMEONE FLUENT IN ENGLISH AND THEY WERE MISSING A LOT OF STEPS - the directions were not clear at all And it took me and my dad about an hour to get all the stuff on because the manual omitted several key steps that we had to figure out on our own...I WOULD NOT TELL A FRIEND TO BUY THIS GUN, at least not until they (seller, manufacturer, distributor) improve the directions a lot!Once we got it figured out and everything together, I have liked this gun and enjoyed it a lot..and it did pretty well for me in an Airsoft war today....but those crappy directions...those crappy directions take it down to 3 stars for me."
4,fun lil toy,"laser doesn't really align with barrel, more for looks and torturing the cats haha, but overall a pretty fun lil toy. for the price its fun to plink around the apartment."
1,Total waste: Cheap and breaks easily,"I purchased this for my son's birthday 3 weeks ahead of time (mistake #1 with a 30-day return policy).I carefully assembled the gun correctly (on a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 7 in difficulty). We went out to shoot and got thru abt 25 rounds and the action lever snapped. Also, the laser site didn't work.It's a cool looking gun...but that's abt it.Steer clear of this gun."
5,Amazon.com,"If you are Military,Security or Police you have to be familar with these type of weapons. Excellent for target practice and affordable. Please obey all laws concerning these weapons. Amazon.com is also great for shopping and delivering,especially health products."
4,cool gun,this gun is pretty cool but not that accurate and the sites are pretty small and the back stock only folds down and its way hard to assemble I cant assemble it unless There was a manual with it but there wasnt.
2,there are better air soft,I think it not so awesome because the sight is too small and the light that comes with it does not work so well and the back stock is also small and its not what it seems like. its good for playing but for shooting in a air soft war your doomed.
1,"Great seller, Poor quality part.","Bought this for my WRX. It did not work. Once installed the temp gauge read normal operating temp before starting the car. Out on the road and up to temp it read past the red zone. I reset the ECU and got the same results.Great seller, amazon, with fast free shipping and hassle free returns! Amazon 5 stars! The part, 0 stars."
5,A great classical forerunner of all that came after.,"Considering the era of films and the yet unexplored technology of the firm industry, The Covered Wagon remains a classic unto itself. This film is the granddaddy of all the great western epics yet to be filmed. I must also mention that the star, J. Warren Kerrigan is my third cousin, and I have spent my lifetime trying to discover if The Covered Wagon was on video or if the film still existed. Casually strolling through your website, not even thinking about this great film, I was in shock when the title popped up on my computer screen. I must say I became quite emotional. Thank you amazon.com."
5,Best sci fi on TV,"There is no better sci fi on TV than ""Fringe"". It's everything you wanted the ""X Files"" to be and wasn't. The acting is great, and it's especially interesting to see the actors do their own parts and their alternate universe doubles. Anna Torv as FBI agent Olivia Dunham is particularly good at showing two distinct personalities, as is John Noble's Walter Bishop. But this series isn't for everyone, and even if you are smart enough to understand what's going on, it helps to have a season or two under your belt before trying to view any one specific episode.BTW - this series is really good about advancing the core plot while having self contained episodes each week. Sometimes they really stretch the limit and have the episodes reflect the issues going on in the core plot, although this is not as common as I would like.FWIW - I recommend viewing the whole series, but if you're pressed for time or $ you can probably skip Season 1."
5,The Fringe,"I can't say enough about this show! It is serious, funny, thought provoking, and entertaining. It keeps you on the edge of yourseat, and you can't wait for the next episode. We begin to love these people, and in miss the others on the other side. It make you think of your own universe. It there another?? The Fringe really makes you think of world outside your own."
5,AWESOME!,Simply my favorite show ever. I love the characters. I own all three seasons and have re-watched them several times. I can hardly wait until the new episodes start back up.
5,Fringe is Awesome,Fringe is one the best on TV! If you haven't been a fan previously be sure to watch the original Pilot to gain a better appreciation of the storyline and characters. Can't wait to see Season Five!
5,Amazing show,"After LOST this is the next best series. Love it! Too sad it's ending this year, but all the seasons are worth watching and rewatching."
3,Reboot-Hollywood speak for lazy.,"A reasonable person would have thought that certain persons would have learned from previous series they had done to do a better job of outlining a future series, so as to avoid being written into corners. Apparently, a person can make good money in Hollywood wothout having to learn this lesson.Enjoyed the first three seasons for the most part, but in this season, even though there were a couple of good episodes (the two Farnsworths episode was probably the best of this season), I think taking the ""it is a different universe now"" road was Lazy.I blame myself for thinking that Fringe would do better, even after having watched another series and a movie that told me what to expect. I just failed to listen.The one reviewer who suggested to look at season 4 as a spin-off made the most sense to me. So, false advertising?"
4,Great series!!,"This is a great series!! Everyone will fall in love with Walter, he's a hoot!! Would recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi."
3,Slow Season,"Although a lot happened in this season, it was at times very slow and not nearly as riveting as the first or second season. Nevertheless, I'm completely hooked and can't wait to see what happens in Season 5. :)"
5,Fringe seems good.,Didn't see Fringe when it first came out. Did manage to catch-up via the wonderful Amazon Prime service. Now we love it! Love it! You must watch this show. It will change your life.
5,Fringe Four,"Another good season, it was worth the wait for the season to come out on DVD, great writing and storylines, plots, can't wait to see how they end the next season which is also the end of the series.. I can't wait to buy that next year, but I will miss this series, hard to find something to watch that is exciting fun to watch, and great writing that also stimulates the mind, Is anyone else like me, I can't stand to watch anything live, it has to be recorded, even better to wait for DVD no commercials to fast forward!!!"
2,So So,"While the episode, as a stand alone, was well executed, it didn't hold my interest. Too many new characters, not enough of Peter. It seems too far off the story line to be interesting, I would have preferred to learn about the Jones arc than this."
3,Product not as described,"I ordered the 6 disc version for $29.99. The product sleeve, 6-disc box, and the disc description within the clam-shell all describe Disc 6 as haveing 4 special features, but there are none on #6 nor on any of the other 5.Does anyone know why the material - described as being included in 3 separate areas - is not included as promised. I like Fringe and have purchased each season as it has become available. This kind of misrepresentation really irritates me."
1,Fringe is great but UltraViolet stinks,"I purchased this thinking that the Digital Copy would allow me to access via iTunes and allow me to catch up on the road. Ultraviolet is horrible and Flixster is worse. Half the time it downloads an unusable copy and the rest of the time it just doesn't recognize the titles in my library. I contacted customer service and was essentially told ""too bad, so sad"". They're trying to address the shortcomings. UV and Flixster create unnecessary obstacles to my enjoyment of what I thought that I had purchased. I already have an iTunes account that works great. Why make me sign up with two additional services that don't work."
2,flat,"I found this episode not very exciting, compared to all others up to this point. I am a big fan of the series, but this particular one was really flat.I think that when the show starting weaving between the two universes, it got pretty complex. But when they pulled characters out (Peter) and injected new ones (Lee), plus the characters had no memory of each other, it got too difficult to follow. This mess started toward the end of season 3 and continues in the first episodes of season 4. Hopefully it will get better."
2,Disappointing,"This season has been disappointing, with weak writing and oddly timed breaks in the season...but, that aside, this episode was just irritating. The observers were always an interesting feature-but they were not the main antagonist as set up throughout the past seasons. Mr Jones had usurped that role, but suddenly a story line developed has been sidelined for some ridiculous story about the bullying, omniscient, corrupt Observers who've taken over the world. Why do they even bother with a plot at all when there seems to be no respect whatsoever for the concept of story anymore? How sad. I actually bought every season and now I feel like a very promising serial with great characters who had good chemistry has been watered down into a scifi channel piece of drivel...And I own it. Wow. Weak. Who pays the people who signed off on this? And why? Horrible. Disappointing."
4,Fringe - the continuing story,I love Fringe - one of the few series that I have bought the dvds. I can watch these over and over.The longer I watch Walter the more I like him.
4,Another innovative season,"Probably my least favorite season out of the series, but the fact that i'm still giving it a 4 star rating should speak volumes of how great this season still is, as is the entire series."
4,Fringe is Great,"Mystery, great acting, mind challenging concepts. The writera seem to have done their home work in most cases where they mix real science with science fiction."
2,"Please, turn back no","I liked this show.I watched it religiously for a few weeks, devoting all my spare time to it. Season 4 is bad. This show has been on a downward trajectory and has finally hit rock bottom. The plot holes keep widening, the acting is getting staler, and it's as if the writers are shlepping out story lines the day before shooting. If I could just get one person from loosing the hours of life to this show that I did, I will sleep well at night."
3,except for the commercials,I love the show but Amazon is running me crazy with starbucks commercials that pop on during the movie. It pops on and i got some crazy commercial about someones mom wanting all cream. not on the main screen you have to come out of full screen to see it-its impossible to turn it off.
2,"Fringe is excellent TV show, but if you are traveling out of US you will waste your money","The TV show is excellent, but because i was traveling after the purchase i couldn't watch the entire show, and it is not allowed to see any tv show in amazon outside US, because is being more than a month i can't ask for reimbursement for the chapters i never watched. Total Waste of money."
3,a promising start but...,"Season 4 had a promising start: 3 episodes without the obnoxious, nauseating, moronic Peter Bishop. Things worked much better without him. Season 3 had become too gooey with Olivia's (this Olivia's) sudden and totally unrealistic crush on him. Writers of TV series probably have never heard of the expression ""shift in tone."" But now it seems that the idiot is back. Mr. Abrahams, kill him for good; otherwise, you may have to discontinue the series later. Virtually nobody can stand that jerk."
1,why i am not interested in fringe.,I HAVE PURCHASED THE FIRST THREE YEARS BUT WILL NOT PURCHASE IT ANY LONGER. WHAT A WAY TO SAVE MONEY ON THE SHOW (AND THAT IS EXACTLYWHAT THEY ARE DOING) WHO THE HELL WANTS TO SEE THE SAME ACTORS PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN. I GUESS THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF IDEAS.THIS DUAL UNIVERSE DOES NOT CUT THE MUSTARD. I BET THEY TOOK THIS IDEA FROM SLIDERS. THAT IS ANOTHER SHOW THAT HAS GONE DOWN HILL.
4,Such a great show!,This show is so interesting and addicting! I recommend it to any sci-fi lover! Its really no like anything else on tv!
4,Cortexiphan,"When it first aired, I thought this was about the lamest season finale I'd ever seen. I was sad, because I do like Fringe, and frankly adore Anna Torv to the heavens. But I've recently viewed nearly every episode in seasons 1 thru 4 again, and I know so much more about the whole Fringe world now, the finale sits easier in my mind, and what with episode 19 being the lead-in to the next season, it all kind of wraps up ok; except for how is Belly alive if he was killed in a car wreck, maybe I missed that part. Dang, so I have to go watch it again?Gotta get me some of that cortexiphan stuff. Please send quotes."
5,Perhaps a little LSD,I love Fringe so much and the fourth season only made that love stronger. I feel sorry for everyone who never watched this sublime show.
4,If you're not watching you're missing out!,"Fringe is such a great show! Even if you're not normally into science fiction or if you struggle with concepts of physics, chemistry and biology. This show will make you forget about all those bad high school memories of these classes. It's perfect blend of science, science fiction, action and of course a little romance. Check it out!"
3,Fringe: The complete Fourth Season,"Arrived fine, but case was broken in several areas, merchandise was not damaged. I'm thinking damage came in mail service."
3,"Good, But Too Far Out for Me","Thought it's well acted, the theme, i.e. two universes, nearly identical is too far fetched for me. Too much fantacy and too little common sense and logic for my tastes. I may watch season 5 when it becomes available on my Prime. Otherwise, for those viewers who like science fiction, go for it."
5,great show - sad it ended,wish they would continue the series - great show. Not looking for something to fill the void the end of Season 5 has left...
5,LOVE FRINGE!!!,Finally an interesting sci-fi series with a plot...too bad it'll be only 5 seasons long! I really enjoyed the first couple seasons best when trying to figure out who's who and what is happening but love each character in their own way.
5,fun!,Fringe is getting a little strange but still one of the best sci-fi series and really glad there is distinct ending coming instead of being cancelled like so many other good shows.
3,"not as good as 1,2 and 3","season four was a let down because seasons 1, 2 and 3 were superb. Four was like they ran out of ideas. It was still good just not as good."
5,This is only the beginning......,"I rate every episode with 5 stars. This is one of the best sy-fy TV shows I have ever seen that was not set in space. I love science fiction movies,TV shows and books because it is based on the truth,something that has happened, something that was found or something that is secretly(perhaps)being worked on, no matter how minute(small) that truth is. Thanks J.J. Abrams, all the great actors/actresses, and John Noble is one of my favorite actors!!!!"
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have watched Fringe from the first episode of the first season. I very much enjoy this genre of movie. I own seasons one through four now and can hardly wait till season five is out on DVD.
5,Great series,My wife and I enjoyed the series on demand and was even more pleased with the prime membership. Would love to see more shows of this kind. Loved having no commercials.
5,Season 4 - answers but still questions,AWESOME season with new characters and answers to some questions and taste if more to come - absolutely spell binding
5,Great series,This series makes you think. The characters are complex & the story line is complex and surprising! Love the timeline twists.
4,Fringe Science with sometmes plausible explanatins,"I prefer science to fiction, but this like the Big Bang contains enough real science to offset the fiction and keep the interest high. This is a show for the intellectual types."
5,Ever since the x-files ended Ive been looking for something to fill its place!,"LOVE this series. Not too many great science fictions shows out there anymore, but this one definitely fills the gap!"
5,Fringe Season 4,I got this as a gift for my husband. It was new and unopened as described. I am pleased with this purchase.
5,Pieces are coming together,"This season was where you began to get the payoff for watching all of the previous seasons. Several pieces of the storyline fall in place into this intricate and addictive puzzle called FRINGE. By Season Four, you are so in love with these incredible characters that you never want it to end!"
4,fringe,"I was worried about this show because of the terrible ending to Lost. The video is a little lagging at times, but over all good. It ends well in season 5."
5,best sci-fi in many moons,if you like science fiction of any genre you will like Fringe.....I have watched all four seasons and enjoy the plots and personalities.
4,Like 24 crossed with Bones! Awesome!,"This show is the perfect combination of the shows 24 and Bones. If you like those shows, you will like this!"
4,Great season!!!,"I enjoyed the season, but it left me very confused. The new season it helping get on track and to start putting together."
3,"Not the best, but good enough",Surprise appearances of Leonard Nimoy in the finale. There was some boring or repeated episodes but there was some goods too.
5,Re: Fringe,I absolutely love being able to watch this show over & over whenever I have the time. It seems like I see new things each time that I have missed previously.
5,Now I have to wait for Season 5,Excellent show and Season 4 is great. Definitely keep up the cliffhangers and craziness. Only disappointment is waiting for Season 5.
5,Love this show,This is was a GREAT price for these discs. I typically buy the DVD versions because of the price difference but not this time!
3,Confusing,"I think that besides the back and forth and the amount of comercial elements, this is possibly the start of the fall of the series."
5,Fringe does it again!,"As a fan of Fringe, I enjoy every season that it has been on. Some of the plots aren't my favorite as the newer season goes along ,But you just got to love the Dad."
5,Fringe season 4,Fast shipping and exactly as I expected. Love the series and will be looking to buy the last season when it becomes available.
5,Gorgeous picture book!,"I work in a library and came across this little jewel of a book the other day. This is a word-free book that tells a remarkable, engrossing story through artist Shinsuke Tanaka's gorgeously detailed & creative grayscale pencil drawings alone. It is a charming, affecting tale perfect for any age that is well worth spending some quality time with. This is a fantastic ""conversational"" book to read to especially little ones to talk about what is going on in the pictures & how the story is proceeding. Highly recommended & one of the most charming picture books I've come across in 5 years of shelving them!"
4,aosudfy,"i downloaded like two songs from this and i was like ""these songs are great but the file must be messed up or something because it sounds all weird."" then i bought it and it sounded EXACTLY the same. anyway. its weird. but the songs are good. and its gonna take years to find a song catchy enough to replace ""for kate i wait"" in my head. buy it, fools."
1,Horrible.,"This book contains more mis-statements, or just plain lies, than anything I have read in a long, long time. Poorly written, full of nonsense and boorish. Wasserman was definitely smoking something when he tried to write this! I am amazed this was ever published."
3,Needs a U.S. edition,"""The Scooter Book"" is written primarily for U.K. readers. Most of the first half describes scoots that are unavailable in the USA, desirable though they may be. But generally the first half is just that: generalities.In the second half, dealing with Maintenance and tuning, the book offers valuable information I have not found elsewhere. From setting the idle speed to modifying the variator and beyond, ""The Scooter Book"" gets into the internals of a scooter.If you want a USA oriented overview, check out the Complete Dummies series for scooters. But if you are after some good, straight-forward maintenance and modification information, I highly recommend ""The Scooter Book""."
3,A nice starter book,This is a good book for those who have no mechanical knowledge and don't know anything about scooters. That said if your searching for actual repair information your best served looking elsewhere.
2,improper shipment,How many did you bill me for as I only ordered one and then found I did not need it. I have received two for some reason and don't feel i should pay to ship one back. If I could I would ship both back as I found the one after ordering and no longer needed it. John Mc Daniel
4,BOOK REVIEW,"I found this book to be interesting and enjoyable. It would be a good selection for most readers of mysteries and suspense novels, not too heavy, but with a strong enough plot to never bore."
2,INTERSTELLAR OVERDRIVE,"Two somewhat rare Pink Floyd tracks plus seven non-Floyd odds and ends. (About half of this cd is the soundtrack from the forgotten 60's film ""Tonite Let's All Make Love In London"".)Tracks: Tonite Let's All Make Love In London (Alan Ginsburg), Interstellar Overdrive (Pink Floyd), Man Of The World (Fleetwood Mac), Interview (Mick Jagger), Here Comes The Nice (Small Faces), Nick's Boogie (Pink Floyd), Angel Of The Morning (P.P. Arnold), America (The Nice), Stop (The Moody Blues.)"
4,LOVE Floyd.,Have always loved the output of BOTH David Gilmore and Roger Waters. Just as good separately as together.
4,Good for review.,This book is good for review except that it lacks enough examples and sample tests. I recommend that you use this book for the review and the tests of Meylani for the practice.
3,Could have been more detailed,This book is very well organized but there is a problem with how topics are covered. There most be a lot more detail on some of the topics. However it is easy to follow ( especially without a tutor ).
4,Very good,"The book is pretty good, the test are harder than the actual. That is actually good for practice. Using this book will increase your scores.Santo Domingo,Dominican Republic"
4,pretty good,"a decent review book. the practice exams are a bit harder than the actual questions, but they're good practice. i prefer the sparknotes version over this one, but this is definitely the 2nd best choice. You want to do both the IC and IIC practice exams becausse they're good practice. i got a 800."
3,Good prep but not very good,"This book is very easy to read but the explanations could be more detailed, exercises and practice tests could be more."
2,Don't Bother,"I owe a lot to the Princeton Review Series, but this particular book is very unhelpful. It wastes time focusing too much on the various formulas that the SAT doesn't even test. Trust me, the formula for volume of a cone won't do you much good. The worst part is the book does not distinguish between what material goes with which SAT II test- Math 1 or 2. What this book does best is freak out test-takers."
2,Makes you feel good (???),This book makes you feel good but in a false way. There are not many examples and only few practice tests.
1,Review for A Primer For Disaster Recovery Planning In An IT,"The book has very little meat to it, although it has 200pg it ends on page 100 and gives you a bibliography. It does not go deeply into how to develop a disaster recovery plan. The second half of the book pretains to irrelevant information."
3,not what was expected,This is not a very good book. It is so vague and definetly what was expected. I would not recommend this book.
2,Cults in the eyes of a cultist,"I checked it out thinking it would be an interesting perspective on some 70s cults, but when I started reading I realized it was on the intellectual level of the booklets Latter Day Saints pass out, with some historical background on other cults.I finally grew tired of the author's preachiness and arrogance, and the rampant hypocrisy in all of his arguments.Probably if you are already a member of a socially acceptable fundamentalist christian cult, you might find this book more interesting."
5,eye openor,"Good easy to understand book on certain cults,I was interested in the witness Lee cult The Local church explained very well indeed ,excellent."
4,The 80's synth pop you never heard,"I was a fan of this band when they first came out and never really got tired of them. If you're into bands like Camouflage, Red Flag, Alphaville, Depeche Mode etc you'll dig these guys. Musically it is quite simple and the production isn't sweet and fat like some of the a fore mentioned groups however the synth sounds are appealing and the lyrics are interesting. I especially like the Spanish songs Oye and Quien Lo Sabia? though their signature sound comes undoubtedly from tracks like Situations and Southern Lands. Fight Without a Reason is also a secondary favorite. This album won't blow you away but it's a solid 80's synth record that any fan of the genre should have."
5,"Exactly what I needed for live performance, delivered swiftly.","I use The Radial Pro D1 Passive Direct Box with a Tacoma Road King. It is easy to use, and merges my guitar nicely into the sound system."
5,"Clean DI, super durable box and jacks","Radial makes incredible stuff - clean preamps and bombproof boxes. This is real pro touring quality. Is box is no exception. It saves me a trip from the van to the stage as I don't have to lug an amp for my singer's strum-along. Great DI box, would absolutely buy again."
4,Sheryl love's to cook (Fairbanks),Christmas is my favorite time of the year and I am always trying to find meals that are healthy and quick to prepare because Christmas is such a busy time of the year for everyone.
2,Great writing; possibly inaccurate measurements?,"The book is bright and cheery, with helpful suggestions on feeding babies and toddlers. However, since the original version was published in Britain, I suspect some of the measurements were not converted correctly. (1/2 TEASPOON of Tomato Puree in a meat sauce??)"
3,"Take it, if you are going for history and museums","This guide is a great book for daydreaming about going to all these amazing places or reminding yourself of them. It's not the most practical ""on the road"" traveller's companion though. There's too few hotel and restaurant recommendations and information on transportation options. Yet the illuminating pictures of historical sites and maps make it an adorably nice looking guide. If these are the things you mainly want from a guidebook, add one star to the rating."
3,subtest 3 was harder than this book leads you to believe!!,The mutltiple choice questions were easy on the test after reviewing with this book...the written selections were very difficult...and this book did not prepare the student enough.
4,"Great prep for CSET!! For the Language section, that is...","This was a great book for the CSET. However, BUYER BEWARE, it really only focuses on the Subtest 1 Language/English section. It gives great advice on how to take all the tests, like how to manage your time for each test/question, and if you're taking certain tests together. The material itself is about the Language section of Subtest 1, which it goes way indepth about. I thought it was the most thorough and informative for that section. However, I was disappointed to find nothing else but that subject!"
3,"Very thin, sleeves are a pain!","This bib does provide pretty good coverage. It is very thin material and easy to clean up. It says it won't stain but I've had mine less than a week and wash it off immediately after my toddler eats and it already has a few stains on it. The sleeves are kind of a pain, my son hates them. But overall it is a pretty good bib!"
4,Love these bibs!,"I have purchased several of these Bibs. They are the BEST that I've found for our messy little two year old boy. I would only change a couple of thing to make it 5 star worthy - first.. the pocket has a single stitch in the middle, at the top where the white ribbing is, which is weird to me. It doesn't go all the way down to make 2 smaller pockets, it's like it's just holding the one big pocket up so it won't sag down? I dunno... but whatever the reason, it makes it harder to clean the pocket out. And second, I wish it were longer. My boy is very messy and so we end up laying a towel in his lap in addition to this bib. BUT.... even with those two little things this is still the best bib I've found for my little guy. Worth the money!"
5,Perfect for toddlers!,These bibs are the BEST!!! Our toddler can feed herself without making a huge mess and clean up is a breeze. It's waterproof so we just rinse off after each meal and wash as needed. Totally worth the cost because you don't need a bunch of them. Love them!
4,It works for us,"I would have given it 5 stars but it has some stitching in the middle of the pocket, (I guess to hold it up), and it doesn't seem to catch as much food as our other bibs. I love the waterproof feature but it does take a little longer to dry than our nonwaterproof ones. I guess you have to choose the features you need for each meal. I like the sleeves because it makes it harder for our 15 month old to pull it off. Overall I like it better than my other bibs."
3,The bibs we got do not match the description,"I bought these bibs for my twin grandchildren because their mother loved the long sleeved ones so much. With the weather so much warmer, long sleeves were sometimes too hot. We were disappointed to find these bibs have Velcro closures instead of the tie closures mentioned in the product description. (this is a quote from the description: ""This full coverage bib features a catch all pocket and tie closure."") She prefers the ties because she has found that the Velcro doesn't hold as well after several washes. I hope they haven't made this a permanent change."
1,"Mold, mold, mold","I'm giving Bumkin bibs one star because their ""proprietary"" material just isn't what it should be. I have used seven of these bibs in rotation over the past year, and really wanted to like them. But all have eventually become embedded with black mold, despite nightly soaking in soapy water, scrubbing and hang drying, machine washing, and bleach soaks. My daughter eats at her grandmother's house wearing a Bumkin bib for four meals a week-- that Bumkin bib didn't mold, perhaps because it was used less frequently-- but because it was dried in front of a sunny window, all the plastic coating peeled off in tiny bits, getting plastic bits all over my daughter (and potentially into her food).Why can't they make a soft plastic bib with thicker plastic that is truly impermeable, period? Why have fabric edges and tags that retain water?For the price, these bibs should stay clean longer than a few months."
5,"Finally, a big enough bib!","My son needed a bib that would cover more than just his chest and this is it! The pockets also help catch food surprisingly, since many bibs they dont. Very nice!"
4,Great customer service,"I bought this bib b/c I love these bibs. I had it for a few months and the velcro closure came off. I emailed to complain and was sent a new bib immediately. Super great customer service. Just be careful with the closure, try not to let your kid pull it off themselves b/c I think that makes the closure loose."
5,Great series,"I disageree with most of the reviewers who think the series took a downhill slide. I read the first book and could not put it down. I am eleven years old and love Mrs. Farley's books. If she is trying to catch the attention of younger horse lovers, well she's definately done it!"
1,Boring and Mindless,"This whole series, to me anyway, is junk. In my opinion, the wild mustangs are very well cared for by the BLM. God, if you wanna read a good, western, great reading book, try Louis L'Amour...."
1,Yawn,"I love classical liturature, and usually find it a rich read. This, however, is a yawn fest and I can'd seem to get more than a third of the way through."
3,something different,"I stumbled across magician among the spirits browsing through the record store, and like the rest of their albums bought it hoping and wondering. I was surprised to find that despite their being only a few strong songs, the sound was different, not the typical sound I'd been hearing for the last 6-7 years. Songs like comedown, ladyboy and romany carvan, were like a breath of fresh air from the church's norm."
2,Bait and Switch!,I was very disappointed that the actual mug I received was not the same mug as depicted in the picture.
3,Great dictionary,"I haven't really taken the time to explore the entire CD. It was confusing, but there are games that you can play, crosswords you make, etc.I am using it strictly as a dictionary. Type in the English word and it gives you all the Russian choices. I ""saw"" the boy, I use a ""saw"" to cut wood. You pick the Russian word that matches how you want to use the English word. It takes you to the Russian dictionary and you can hear the word pronounciation. You also have other choices in the Russian section as well, in English, showing how it is used.You have to ""sound out"" the spelling of the Russian words, but when making my own flashcards, this is great. As a writer that drops ""Russian words"" into the text, it's just what I needed.I give it 3/5 stars because I was so lost with it in trying to figure out how the other stuff besides the dictionary works."
1,Simply awful,"There is only ONE track on this CD that is worth listening to. (#4 -- quite exquisite, actually.) The rest is total garbage. Why the horrible voiceovers from the composer? Total amateur hour. Inane. I'm giving this CD away at the next garage sale on my street -- just gonna walk up and give it away to someone."
1,doesn't work,I tried to send the collar back and it is a health item so they will not let you return it otherwise they have a 20 percent restocking charge. Will not buy from these people again.
4,Works like it is suppose to,"This product works like it is suppose to. I think I should have ordered a smaller size, however this works just find. I would not use it without a Dr. recomendation."
2,Portable Neck Traction,Instructions for some other product came with this therefore difficult to learn how to use it at first. Once I figured it out I still didn't like it because it's uncomfortable to wear.
5,Works for reducing my chronic neck pain and headaches.,"Pain is reduced, muscles in my neck and upper back are relaxed, and my headaches are less severe when I use this. My chiropractor told me to order it. He was very honest with me and told me that I should do as much as I can for myself at home and that if I used this device I wouldn't have to come in as often. He was right. Using this is giving me a great amount of relief and now I see him about once every 2-4 weeks. I have more than on herniated disc in my neck and would have more than likely ended up in a surgeons office without his advice. Dr. Bob's has paid for itself. I so much appreciate the honesty of my Chiropractor. I know he has my best interest in mind when he show's me what I can do for myself."
3,Dr. Bob's oriental traction collar,Dr. Bob's traction. I love it but it does not always hold the air. It was said to be new but the box looks very old. Was this actually a used item??
2,Not for those with long necks.,"I'm tall and have a longer than average neck. This device, even when fully inflated, doesn't reach both my shoulder and skull. I am forced to wrap a towel around my shoulders and then place the device on top of the towel in order to raise it up high enough to get any traction. In addition, the one way valve in the inflating bulb pops out a lot - the ""plumbing"" feels cheap."
2,Heavy Tar/Petroleum Smell is a turn off,"The title says it all. I have previously ordered the same item with the same ""Dr. Bob's"" brand. The box says ""Made in China"". But, in general, this device made all the difference for me previously (C6/C7 pinched nerve causing numbness in fingers and pain in my arm). So, if you know how to get one without the smell, I say go for it. I will try to return mine when I get the time and hope to get a non-smelly replacement."
4,Works great,"This thermal carafe works perfectly,always align lid properly,I'm guessing that might have been a problem for some reviewers,the water level in the machine is controlled by an opening in the back,that may be new, but you cannot overfill this. I love it , the coffee stays nice and hot for hours."
4,Truly Met Expectations,"I bought this a few months ago via Amazon and have used it daily ever since. I have been ""very pleased"" with this coffee maker. I had been looking for a 12 cup thermal (for some reason they are HARD to find - but 10 cup units are easy to find in thermals - go figure?!?).I have been very pleased with this unit:* Very easy to operate* Very easy to clean (however, I would HIGHLY suggest a #4 cone permanent coffee filter instead of paper ones)* Brews 'hot'. I have checked the temp of brew and find mine consistent at 197 degrees - very good for a home brewer - impressive.* Coffee remains hot in the thermal (my wife and I do drink a fair bit of coffee - so, I haven't brewed a pot and 'waited' hours to see if it is still hot. Like any coffee thermal it is going to lose heat over time - but within the two hours we have used it - it has remained very nicely hot.Overall, I have enjoyed this brewer and hope to for some time."
2,This coffee maker has problems.,"Thermal pot is good and keeps coffee hot, and I was very excited about finding a 12 cup thermal pot. However, on several occasions (about 5 our 6 within the month I have had it) the water has overflowed the coffee basket and gone all over the counter top."
5,Cuisinart Coffee Maker,"This my second one of these coffee makers! It has exactly what I am looking for, 12 cup, stainless carafe, programmable!! It cannot be found locally where I live and was so happy to be able to find in on Amazon!!!"
1,Not very good....,After using it for a week or so it totally fell apart. The coffee did not keep hot for as long as it should have and I think that has to do with the locking system on the lid. I love the principal of keeping the coffee hot and have used other brands of thermal coffemakers. The main reason I went with the Cuisinart was the 12 cup Thermal. At the time there were not many 12 cup Thermals to select from. I have always loved the Cuisnart products but this one fell short.
3,Too tall...,"Never got a chance to taste the coffee. Brought home and immediately found it was too tall to fit under our cabinets... it's 16"" tall. Thought someone might want to check that before they buy."
2,10 cup coffee maker,"It is supposed to be a 12 cup coffee maker but after spilling several cups of coffee all over the counter and floor, I realized that the special patented lid prevents the carafe from filling all the way. So don't fill the coffee maker to the 12 cup mark, keep the max at 10 cups and you'll be ok. It does a good job making those 10 cups of coffee though. The spilled coffee did a great job leaving stains on the wall from spilling over the sides of the counter. I've never had a coffee maker overfill by bad design; of course, we only bought Mr. Coffee brand makers before. Cuisenart needs to wake up and fix this issue before someone sues them for property damage. Just make it a 10 cup coffee maker and everything else is fine."
5,Love it!! Keeps coffee hot for HOURS!,"I am not a coffee drinker at all, but my husband is a coffee nut! Before this pot, he'd brew a pot in the AM, and pretty much keep it turned on all day, so that when he needed a cup it'd be warm. The result was a ""dirty ashtray"" smell in our kitchen! This pot allows him to have his hot coffee when he wants it without the burnt coffee smell.It's simply AMAZING!! I actually recorded the coffee temps and found that 12 hours later the coffee was still 130 degrees.The only problem we've had was when my husband would grind the coffee too fine, it gets stuck and causes the brew basket to overflow making a real nasty river of coffee in the kitchen. Once we figured out what the culprit was, it's been pure bliss since then!"
5,This coffee maker is the best!,"After a few years of using an old Black & Decker carafe model and getting tired of wiping up the counter in the morning I had enough. I searched around for a quality maker and read all the reviews I could. My needs were few but demanding, the first was coffee that was hot, too many makers make a Luke warm brew and to me there is nothing worse. Second was a great tasting coffee, being a black and no sugar drinker I wanted a maker that would let the natural taste come through. To a black drinker this is very important because sugar and milk can mask the natural taste. Finally I was just tired of the mess when the old maker would clog or not work properly and I would come down in the morning to a big mess and worse no coffee. The Cuisinart has met all my needs and I am extremely pleased, the coffee is piping hot (for hours) taste great and so far not one morning mishap. I would recommend this maker to any coffee drinker."
5,Nice Things to Say,This Cuisinart makes a great pot of coffee with no fuss and then keeps it warm all day without using energy.
1,I recieved a different coffemaker,"While I ordered the stainless steel coffemaker, I recieved another model with a glass carafe and returned it. I eventaully purchased the coffemaker I wanted locally."
1,DIMENSIONS,"i was ready to buy (i LOVE cuisinart products) BUT the DTC-975BKN programmable auto brew 12-cup coffeemaker is TOO TALL--my current cuisinart coffeemaker (which is a great machine & still works great) is 14"" tall--i would have to shave off 1"" on my kitchen cabinet to get it to fit flush against the backsplash area. i'm not ready to compromise the stability of my cabinets to accommodate this coffeemaker.....drats!!! i love the idea that the coffee goes directly into a carafe (and is NOT a grind & brew machine). maybe i'll check into a smaller version of this--if cuisinart makes one."
1,Cuisinart Coffemaker,"This coffeemaker is of low quality, poor construction, cheaply made.Will not likely purchase any Cuisinart products in the future."
1,Constant clogging and overflowing! A real disaster.,"We were very excited when we first purchased this item, and it took quite a long time to get as it was back ordered. There is not much competition for this sized coffeemaker with the thermal carafe. The coffee is good tasting and it stays hot, but the trouble with the clogging and overflowing makes it extremely time-consuming and nervous-making! We have two of these pots and they are both lemons. We tediously clean each part, daily, in order to minimize the overflowing--but it still does flood. I would like to return these, and get my money back if I could! If you value your time and money, I would not buy this product! Cuisinart customer service is also very difficult to reach, and not very helpful or responsive."
1,metal carafe leaks water all over while brewing,"I didn't listen to the other reviews after I read them and went ahead and purchased this coffee pot as I have had couple Cuisinartcoffee makers with glass carafes. The reviews were all correct when they said the coffee pot leaks water all over. I tried itseveral different times and followed directions exactly and halfway through brew water started running off top of carafe & all over counter. What good is having a programmable pot if you have to stand and watch it all through the brew process, so you can stop it.Cuisinart really needs to sit up and listen and change this carafe lid as they will miss so many sales and have more & more returns. Ithink it is forming a vacuum halfway through the brewing process. Shouldn't be that difficult to get resolved. I had to buy different brand to get the stainless carafe, so they missed another sale or actually another one returned to them. Wake up Cuisinart!"
1,"found the clock did not work, but the replacement does","I received this product, and found that I could not set the clock, I have sent it back, and the replacement is working very well. I'm very satisfied with it."
4,Big caraffe and keeps warm,"This is our third one of these. The writing wears off really quickly, but we have it memorized. If you over fill the grounds, it will leak all over and make a giant mess. Otherwise, this works great."
1,15% failure rate means I'd give this zero stars if I could,"I bought my first one of these ten years ago, and it was great - worked liked a charm every time without fail. When it finally died this year, we replaced it with another one. This one overflows once or twice every two weeks and makes a HUGE mess. I started brewing with he entire apparatus in the sink, but still after every failure, I have to rinse coffee grounds out of every tiny hole in every tiny part. I've tried gold filters, paper filters, using less coffee, using less water, aligning it this way, aligning it that way... I don't know what it is about this new one, but it is just bad/wrong/unusable, and I am here on Amazon today looking for something similar that will work reliably. It makes me sad, because I really loved the first one."
1,Throwing in the Garbage,We have tried and tried and tried to intuit why this coffee maker decides to create a big mess. We clean out the lid with hot water. We blow out through the top to see if there are any stuck grounds. We double check to see that the lid is correctly in the carafe. We hold our arms a certain way and pray to the cuisinart gods. All the time without our morning caffeination.I had grown accustomed to just keeping the dishwasher open so that the mess would just flow in there in the *likely* event that this coffee maker decided to have a tantrum. Some mornings I have attempted three pots.I'm done. I don't need this torture. I'm throwing it in the garbage.
1,Bad taste,From the first cup the coffee had a strange taste. I described it as a strong plastic taste while my wife and a neighbor both described it is a strong metalic taste. We cleaned the coffee maker twice as recommended by the manufacturer but it did not change the taste of the coffee. We use Starbucks fresh ground coffee and had no problem with the taste with our previous coffee maker. We were able to return the coffeemaker for a full refund and purchased a Capresso MT600 which we are extremely satisfied with ... It makes great tasting coffee.
1,Don't Do It,"I had a read a number of cautions in this space about coffee overflowing, so when I tried the coffee maker this morning for the first time, I read the instructions and took special care to ensure I didn't add too much water and that I sealed everything properly. Nevertheless, I ended up with coffee and grinds all over the counter. I cleaned everything up and tried again. But for a second time, I ended up with coffee and grinds all over the counter (but not as much since I was quick to hit the off button). Suffice it to say, I'm returning the coffee maker ASAP."
2,Do you like guessing?,"I was looking for a new coffeemaker after the Cuisinart with a glass carafe had its warming unit boiling my coffee in the carafe. That frightened me as it could have started a fire. I read all the reviews and decided a coffeemaker that didn't use a warming unit would be better. Plus, the stainless carafe looked so good.I have used this for two months and am going to get a different brand that doesn't use a carafe at all. The reason being is the stainless steel carafe doesn't have any cup measurements on it so you have to guess how much water you are filling it with nor does it indicate how much coffee is left in it. It, like many of the previously stated comments, also is difficult to get the cap on correctly so the pour opening is where it should be. I think it pours too slowly besides."
2,Listen to the negatives,"This coffeemaker does do a lovely job of keeping the beverage warm (not as hot as I'd like, but still acceptable). But it's not worth the money, not when the coffee pours down the sides of the carafe and all over your counter and floor. I do my darndest to make sure the carafe is placed just so and the basket is in tight, but there seems to be no guarantee that the coffee will go into the pot and not onto the floor. Cuisinart, you can do better than this. And coffee lover, so can you. (I've been a loyal Amazon customer for 20 years, and this is the first review I ever posted. So when I tell you this thing is annoying, please believe it.)"
5,Coffeemaker,Cuisinart coffeemaker is A+. I would recommend this for anyone who likes fresh coffee and is a fanatic about good tasting brew.
3,After having one for years and loving it.....,I have owned 3 of these Cusinart coffe makers. I love the thermal carafe! My first maker lasted about three years. I didn't consider any other maker because that one was so good. The last two unfortunately have not even lasted a year. I am now hesitating to spend so much money on a coffee pot not knowing how much use I will get out of it. There is no other make that has these features. What am I going to do???
4,great coffemaker,this coffeemaker makes the best coffee ever i put the carafe and top cover in the dishwasher just be carefut to hand wish the filter basket once i put it in the dishwasher and lost the spring and nylon piece that holds the spring in had to order another filter basket from cuisinart this the reason i gave it four stars overall a great purchase. enjoy this is good if you like a lot of coffee.keeps it warm for 4 hours
1,We threw out the machine this morning.,"Hello fellow coffee drinkers - This is the second time we are editing our original review for the Cuisinart coffee maker, because we threw out the damned machine this morning. Despite carefully prepping the machine, it overflowed TWICE this morning. It now sits in the garbage where it belongs. Too bad... it made good coffee when it felt like it."
1,Problems after 60 days,"I purchased a DCT-975BNK and 60 days later started having problems. The coffee maker would turn on without being programmed and you can smell and hear the heater core cooking away on its own. Also problems brewing, would only brew one cup at a time, beep 5 times and turn off, and you have to keep pushing ON to get a full pot. I called Cuisinart customer service their solution was ""unplug it for an hour and if it turns on again call back"". If it still turns on, I have to pay $10 processing and the return shipping. Said it was unplugged all night after it turned on by its self the first time. Weary about the response from customer service as I believe having a heater core run on its own could potentially be a hazard, not to mention not thrilled having to pay the return shipping. Not too comfortable with a ""let's see how it goes approach"" on a home appliance with a heating element malfunctioning, and makes me question their level of commitment to their customers."
4,We love this machine.,"Pros:Coffee tastes great.Stays hot for hours.Doesn't burn the coffee.Very attractive.Easy to use.Timer feature is handy.Beep is loud, but not annoying.3 year warrantyCon:Unit is 16"" tall. Doesn't fit on counter beneath cabinets."
1,The overflow problem,"PLEASE take to heart the comments about overflow. Our coffee maker is less than a year old, and I am SICK of walking into the kitchen and finding -- no, not a lovely cup of hot coffe -- but a big huge mess. As another reviewer mentioned, this is not a result of user error, but of poor design. Buy this and take your chances."
5,Best coffee maker I ever owned,"Clearly, the impatient masses are having trouble with alignment and/or don't know how to make a decent cup of coffee in general. this is probably the 10th coffee maker I've owned, from cheap to expensive, and this moderately-priced one is best of all. I love that the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot and consistent without turning burnt and bitter for not 3 or 4 hours, but more like 12+ (I sometimes make it at night and it's still piping in the morning). Even a couple of days later the coffee hasn't deteriorated. The one time I did get the mess others discussed was when I didn't have the carafe properly positioned, so I'm just more careful now. It was user error, not the machine! Also, it doesn't matter what type of coffee I use, from cheapest to fancy blends, it turns out a consistently perfect cup o' Joe."
5,Great Buy!,I owned the previous model and it lasted for 3 years. The coffee is perfect every time. The only thing that I don't like is that the auto function stays on. (I don't have to set it every day)
5,Excellent Coffeemaker,We have had this product for several months now and have had zero problems. The coffee is great and stays hot for hours. The only quibble is that the thermal pot is heavy and you must tilt it about 120 degrees for it to pour. But those factors are apparently necessary to retain heat. So far a very good product.
3,Cuisinart Coffee Maker,Time display print is almost too small ato read with no back lighting. Am/Pm display and program display letters are even smaller. Otherwise coffee making operation is great
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews before purchasing and discounted the warnings about overflow. But sure enough I have already come into the kitchen 2 mornings to find coffee everywhere. It is not just getting the top on right, it is also making sure the pot is not tilting in the slightest and no coffee grounds go into the drip valve causing it to stick (not open all the way).Also, it just seems to be made cheep. It doesn't even have a light to show when auto brew is on - just a microscopic icon on LCD. We had another Cuisinart for 11 years used it to brew literally thousands of pots of coffee and I should have just purchased another one of those. Come to think of it, I think that is what I will do.Sure the carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours, but that doesn't make up for the rest of it."
1,Don't buy this!,"On the 3rd day, this machine kept shutting off before it finished brewing. On the 4th day, it wouldn't brew at all. I would give this 0 stars if there was the option."
1,They're Right!!! It Constantly Overflows!,"Folks - this machine is a dud. I read all of the reviews, and chose to believe those that said they weren't having the overfilling problem. BALONEY! 2 out of the 5 batches I've made have spilled all over my kitchen counter, and I am returning this piece of crap today. AVOID!"
3,"Good coffee, but cleaning the pot is hard","Only problem is how to get the coffee smell out of the pot and how to get the coffee smell out of the top. Other than that, it's fine."
5,Happy with purchase,"I've been very happy with this coffee maker. Haven't had any problems with leakage/over flowing as some other reviewers complained about. As long as you screw the cap on straight, it won't leak. The pot its self has a nice sturdy weight to it; the coffee brews very hot too. One thing you will need is a bottle brush to clean it as your hand won't fit!"
1,terribly designed,"Very fussy lid....you struggle to get the ""thread"" correct. Then, when you pour, coffee dribbles from the top of the lid (where the doo-dad thru which the coffee enters the carafe as it is brewed is) while it gushes messily from the spout. And that's becuase the caraffe isn't designed properly...you have to tilt it up at such an extreme angle in order to get the coffee out of it that the coffee then gushes out of the spout (while it dribbles from the top contraption). It's really a mess of a coffee maker. I even gave up coffee for a few months because I found it so miserable.I should have just returned it but I kept thinking it was me. Now that family and friends have all used it and feel the same way, I realize it is a mess of a machine. I'll never buy another Cuisinart after this experience!"
2,Burnt bitter coffee.,"This coffee maker gives me nice hot coffee that tastes bad. I buy Kona coffee blends and my friends $20 Mr. Coffee makes a perfect brew, compared to my $100 coffee maker. I called Cuisinart because I thought... there is no way I am the only one...... all the rep asked was ""is anything broken?"" I would have liked the rep to act like they cared; by trouble shooting, or something. If there is another great Cuisinart product-- I am not buying it."
4,Good coffee,"The only reasons for four stars is the top to the coffee maker - does not pour well without lining it up precisely with the 'pour' mark that disappears after first couple of uses (its is a tiny black line on a black lid and you cannot find it). More of a daily annoyance than something that makes the coffeemaker nonfunctional. I really, really miss my old Krups, but it is not made anymore."
4,Great coffee maker,"This is one of the best coffee makers I have ever purchased. If you love coffee, then you will love this Thermos Nissan 34-Ounce Vacuum Insulated Stainless-Steel Gourmet Coffee Press. I love mine and its definitely worth it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S1DB/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00004S1DB&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazon070f-20"
2,Would not order this coffee pot,"This was a completed disappointment and I would return it if I still had the box. The drip component does not work half of the time so coffee leaks all over the counter and coffee remains in the filter and does not drip through. I spent a lot of time researching what coffee maker to get, read all of the reviews on Amazon, went to consumer reports and I am very sorry that I purchased this one! I had an Krupps Aromatic and loved it and wish that I could find something as good to replace it. This was not it!Update on the leaking - it turns out that there is a rubber stopper on the inside of the filter cup that was in upside down. Once I fixed this, the spring action that controls the drip started to work. I have found that the key is to clean this stopper out after every use and to use a coarse grain coffee. Still not loving this machine but it is not leaking all over the place now and it does keep the coffee warm for a few hours."
2,Cuisinart coffee maker,"This coffee maker was sporadic in brewing. You never knew when it would overflow. Regardless of the varied quantities of water, coffee or type of coffee grind. It appeared that it was the sediment that would seep through the filter and plug the outlet just below the filter."
1,Does not work properly,Will not turn on and brew. This is the second one we've ordered in a row and both were faulty. We will not be buying this product in the future.
5,Closest thing to a perfect coffeemaker you'll ever find,"We've had several coffeemakers in the past few years including the Hamilton Brewmaster (or leak-master in our opinion) and this coffeemaker is BY FAR the best. We set the coffee pot for 5am and when we get home at 4pm the coffee is still warm to the touch! No joke. And, it's still quite drinkable (with a quick nuke) since it hasn't been fried on a warming plate all day and bitter tasting.My ONLY complaint about this machine is that I wish you could turn the ready alert beep off or at least down. It's pretty loud and sounds remarkably like our house alarm chime so it has woken us up in a panic on a Saturday morning more than once --but that's my only complaint so we'll gladly live with it.All in all, I am extremely happy with this coffeemaker and recommend it to everyone!"
4,Great coffee but need's tweaks,"My gold standard for great home coffeemakers is still my well used, 8 year old Starbucks 8 cup thermal Barrista. However, this one makes coffee every bit as good (I just needed a 12 cup thermal). So why only 4 stars? Two reasons:1) It needs a removable water reservoir to avoid spills and easily fill it at the sink, not the counter.2) The whole brew/pour system should be as simple as the Barrista's. My biggest gripe is that the removable container for the filter/coffee can't stand up by itself for ease of filling it...you need 1 hand to hold it upright and the other to scoop the coffee...a not so easy task to avoid spilling the grounds.This unit is complex in a way, but after you get aquainted with prepping it, your reward is a great cup of freshly brewed coffee in the thermos carafe anytime. I would highly recommend it to technically savvy friends."
2,Not my cup of tea (coffee!),About a week or two after receiving this coffee pot it stopped working. Amazon promptly replaced it - thank you Amazon!! I do not care for this overall. To me it is not user friendly. I know it just a coffee pot. But where I have it placed on my counter I need to pull it out and turn it sideways to fill it with water. Also it states you can interrupt the brew cycle to pour a cup of coffee. You can't with the one I have. He keeps dripping. Also it has a lid that allows you to pour without twisting the lid. It pours to slow for my liking. My next coffee pot will not be a Cuisinart.
1,BIG LET DOWN,"We've had good experiences with Cuisinart 12 cup thermal coffee makers. The one before this, easily lasted more than 10 years. But this one, a little over a month. Suddenly it just wouldn't empty the water from the reserve into the basket.Also, count me among those who are unsatisfied with the new steel lined caraffes. The glass ones kept the coffee warmer,longer. It is possible to get semi-warm coffee; if you first run very hot water through the caraffe before brewing.Right now we're at a loss as to what to try next that will make hot coffee for a crowd. Any ideas?"
5,Cuisinart coffee maker -- keeps coffee really hot!,We love this coffee maker. It keeps the coffee hot for hours and the brewing process produces a beautiful cup of perfectly brewed coffee. Would recommend it highly!
2,"Good for the 1st yr, ok for the next 6 mo and then gone","Liked the styling and the thermal carafe. Button labels are just painted on and wear off rather quickly for the buttons you use most. This maker made coffee fine for the 1st 9 to 12 mo's. It started having intermittent failures over the past 6 mo's or so. Sometimes it just would not operate. I have no idea why. Today it seems it has died. It came on but wouldn't heat the water to start the brewing process.This is a fine product if you're ok with disposable $100 appliances, but in general I wouldn't recommend this. Appliances should last more than 18 mo's. The quality just isn't here with this maker."
5,Read and Follow Directions!,"I read from other reviews on Amazon that, if I followed directions for the Cuisinart thermal carafe 12-cup coffee maker, there would be no problems of ovwe filling or spilling. I read the directions carefully and I have perfectly brewed HOT delicious coffee waiting for me every morning. We could not be happier."
4,Cuisinart Coffeemaker,Makes a very good pot of coffee and the thermal carafe id excellent at keeping the coffe hot and with good flavor. Only downside I've found is the pause & brew drips if you pull the pot before brewing is complete.
3,Water Capacity exceeds Coffee Capacity,A #4 filter doesn't hold enough coffee to make 12 cups. Not to my liking in any case. Get a ten cup machine that takes up less space.The occasional overflow problems associated with brew pause are readily solved by removing the brew pause valve. A small rubber washer in the bottom of the filter holder keeps it in place. Taking a cup out of the brew disturbs the balance of the pot. Remove the valve and be patient.
4,Like most everything about this coffee pot,"I like most everything about this coffee pot, would like to be able to read the time better, it's some what of a challenge. Also can not fill the caraf through my refrigerator water dispenser. The caraf keeps the coffee hot for quite a while, this is a Big plus."
2,I would not reccomend this coffee maker.,I liked the styling of this cofee maker but have given it a low rating due to the consistency of the coffee it brews. A couple of times when I have programmed a time to brew automatically it seems not to heat the water hot enough and it ends up brewing weak coffee. Other times it seems to work ok but not consitently. I would have expected a better quality product from Cuisinart.I would not reccomend this coffee maker.
2,warm coffee,"I replaced a cuisinart programmable coffeemaker with a glass carafe with this thermos model because the glass carafe broke very easily and it cost $25 each time I replaced it. The problem with this coffeemaker is that it does not keep the coffee hot enough. I have to warm the metal carafe with hot water before I start the process, and the coffee does not remain hot for very long. There is no heated pad under the pot. My husband wants to throw it out and start over again."
4,Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Thermal 12-cup coffeemaker,"This is the same coffeemaker as the same one I replaced and it does have some not perfect aspects,i.e if the filter/ coffee basket is not seated correctly the coffee and grounds are diverted out of the pot. Just make sure the basket is seated correctly and life is good. It makes good coffee and I love the thermal pot,which keeps the coffee hot for hours and maintains the flavor."
1,Good coffee not worth the mess it makes other times,"I've had this machine for just over a year. Had the carafe lid and filter basket replaced by Cuisinart once. Then had the whole machine replaced later, with an expense for shipping. Still having the same issue: the filter basket fills faster than it empties, creating an overflow that spills coffee and grounds on counter and floor. Not every time, but often enough to tell me to give up on this machine. I grind beans at a medium setting and/or use store-bought preground, so this should not be happening. A post to Cuisinart's Facebook page last year yielded zero response, even as Customer Service paid attention to the ones before and after it. I quit."
3,Good for 2 years,"I wanted a 12-cup thermal coffee maker because I do a lot of entertaining. This one worked great for awhile, but at about 6 months, it popped open while I was pouring a cup of coffee (black plastic part unsealed from metal thermal part) After cleaning up the mess, I snapped it back together and it worked great again... for awhile. I have continued to use it because the ""mess incidents"" were infrequent but the last time, it split apart again after only 2 uses. I'm replacing it but will try another brand."
2,Over Rated Coffee Maker,"The pros: coffee is always hot, and is not sitting on a hot plate.The cons: very difficult to pour, because it also drips out of the lid. Extremely difficult to clean the lid. Some coffee seems to stay in the lid, and takes too long to drain out. This product is not very consumer friendly, if you want to keep it clean.We always used a Braun 560 and loved it, but is not available anymore. We are very disappointed in the Cuisinart."
2,Several design brain cramps,"I bought this Cuisinart as a replacement. My old Cuisinart gave up the ghost after two years, but overall it was much better designed. This one seems carelessly put together: (1) the mouth of the thermal carafe is so small, a bottle brush inserted for cleaning sprays water over you when you pull it out. (2) The auto turn-on feature has no light; the only way you can tell if it's set is to stand next to the machine and read the display screen, which is VERY dim. (3) I've had it for only four months, but already the auto shutoff feature isn't working. Take the pot out during brewing to pour an early cup, and the coffee just keeps running. I won't buy from Cuisinart again, since their design/quality control departments appear to be on snooze function."
5,Great coffee maker,"Makes coffee fast. Easy to clean. The greatest feature is when it's done, just take the carafe off the unit and set it aside. When you pour, no need to turn the top or open. Eliminates people leaving the top off when they get a cup, and also is easy for us lazy people."
4,Good coffee maker,"Well made, works well and fast and has a beeper to let you know when it's done. Coffee stays hot for a few hours"
1,big disappointment,"I felt compelled to share my horrible experience with this coffeemaker. I've owned a Mr Coffee for years, and wanted to try a thermal carafe model, figured Cuisinart was a good name to go by. Anyway, this machine was a BIG disappointment. The coffee tasted terrible (same kind I used in the other machine that always tasted good), the machine requires more than twice the amount of coffee grounds as my Mr Coffee Accel did, to produce an even halfway-palatable cup of coffee. But the worst part, was that the coffee didn't even brew hot. It was on the border of lukewarm, every single pot I brewed. I will never buy another Cuisinart."
3,Pretty good; but older model was better,"I bought one of these a few years ago and it was great. The coffee came out very hot and stayed hot until about 1pm (coffee was brewed at 7am). I recently bought a new one (same model), and the coffee doesn't come out as hot, and needs re-heated in the microwave by 10am.Both coffee makers suffer from an ocassional overflow, where the coffee couldn't make it out the bottom of the filter and overflowed out the top and made a huge mess.The old model is great, I wish I could get another one. I'm a little disappointed by the new one."
2,Overflow coffee maker,"Makes great coffee, but Don't buy one. Must be watched. Sooner or later it WILL overflow. I'm on my second unit and it overflowed during the pre-brew -water only cycle. Timer setting can't be used because you can't leave the coffeemaker unattended."
5,the one to purchase !,"I am a coffee gourmet and this is the best coffeemaker I have owned in years! The coffee brews right into the carafe, thereby, not loosing some of the flavor while brewing. It keeps the coffee hot for a long time. Don't waste your time looking for anything else if you want a decent cup O' Joe. One tip I would recommend - When assembling the carafe after washing, make sure the lid is screwed on correctly."
4,Great coffeemaker but just one pet-peeve,"I just bought this coffeemaker two days ago (from Macy's at the same price) for 3 main reasons: it makes 12 cups, a sturdy thermos (I'm clutsy and had broken my previously purchased thin glass coffeepot 3 times), and a programmable timer. So far, it works great, and after getting home from a long day of Christmas shopping yesterday, it was nice to enjoy a cup of coffee that still tasted fresh and warm.Now, the thing that REALLY bugs me about this coffeemaker is that it ""BEEPS"" when the coffee is ready. With a 22-month old who sleeps lightly, and a little dog that is a bit neurotic, having a beeping coffeemaker makes my dog bark and my daughter wake up much too early. Couldn't they just add a green light to illuminate when the coffee is done? Hopefully, my dog will get used to the sound. :)P.S. I believe the reviewer who kept overflowing this coffeemaker should add less water. ;)"
5,Cuisinart Thermal Coffeemaker pretty good,"We purchased the Coffee maker due to the larger pot size over the other brands. The coffee comes out plenty hot and stays hot for a long time. Coffee flavor is good and is comparable to an older high end MR. Coffee maker we have at the house. So far so good and I would purchase another one if needed. Only issue I have found so far is it pours slow, even with the lid loosened. We just take it off to pour now. I have no trouble seeing the display but others have mentioned it. This maker was hard to find but worth the wait."
1,I hate it.,"I hate this coffee pot. While it does keep your coffee hot, I have had it overflow coffee grounds all over my kitchen too many times too count. The only thing I like about it is how long the coffee stays hot. The other thing I find frustrating is how it leaks when you pull the pot out to pour a cup of coffee before it is totally done dripping into the pot. At times it works, most mostly it leaks. I hate it and we are putting it in the trash. It has leaked even when we have double and triple checked that the lid has been screwed on correctly. For sure there is a design flaw in how the drip container connects and drips coffee into the pot."
5,great coffee and great thermos,"this is our second cuisinart brewer. We used the last one to death! We love this machine. It is easy to run over if you are not careful but this is a user fault. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours. Our only complaint is the loud beep sound when the coffee is ready--also a minor thing, but a common complaint. Why doesn't Cuisinart make this a on/off beeper?"
2,"Good coffee, good carafe, but overflows too easily.","We bought this coffee maker for our office (full of experienced coffee maker users), and we ended up returning it after the 4th overflow clean-up. Not sure what causes the problem, but if it overflows that easily, it's just too sensitive.The coffee itself was good, though, and it did stay warm and drinkable all day."
2,Good coffeemaker; bad customer service,"The coffee machine worked well for 9 months - then the 'seep through' lid stopped working, spilling coffee all over my kitchen floor -- it turns out oak cabinets and the inside of drawers don't react well to en entire pot of coffee. When I asked Cuisinart for a new lid, they told me it was out of warranty and I'd have to buy one. So, apparently Cuisinart and Amazon had let my unit sit on the shelf for a couple years before shipping it off to me, and it's MY FAULT? The policy itself is unacceptable - but toss onto it the customer service reps categorically dismissing my issue due to the apparent warranty period (really, after 9 months?). They turned an opportunity of creating a lifelong customer into a lost one..."
2,"Makes great coffee, BUT...","Bought this coffee maker about a year and a half ago. Was very happy with it until the black plastic handle and top broke completely free of the stainless carafe about 6 months ago. It broke in the middle of pouring a cup of coffee, spilling coffee everywhere. We attempted to fix it by gluing the black plastic top onto the stainless steel with super glue. Yeah, that didn't work and again ended up with a full pot of coffee on the floor and all over us, this time the entire handle snapped off. By the way, we are NOT super humans with extraordinary strength! And we didn't beat up or treat the carafe badly, just used it normally as one would when making coffee. Just plain poor design on Cuisinart's part. Boo. I would've rated this 1 star, but it did make pretty good tasting coffee."
3,Nice Coffeemaker.....While It Worked,"I also ignored the negative reviews for this coffeemaker. I love the convenience of having coffee brew into a thermal carafe, keeping it hot. This coffeemaker did that, but after about 9 months I noticed the coffee wasn't quite as hot as it was at first, and then a few months ago, after having this appliance for approximately a year, it simply stopped working, just like that. In reading all the reviews on all coffeemakers I'm back at the beginning, it seems no company makes a decent 12 cup thermal coffeemaker.....and I really don't want less than 12 cups and would gladly buy a 14 or 16 cup coffeemaker, but don't see anything like that on the market. Will continue to research and hunt for a new coffeemaker...."
1,Leaks and cheaply made,This a flimsy coffeemaker that leaks all over the counter. The basket filter holder is not a very good design. Returning it today.
1,YOU'LL BE SORRY BUYING THIS JUNK!!!,"I finally gave up on this junk. Before buying this product, I read reviews, one of the consistant negitives was that it gets ""cloged"" and creates a big mess with coffee overflowing, spilling over to the floor. YOU NEED TO WATCH COFFEE BREW to make sure it doesent over flow. Spent over $100 FOR JUNK!...going back to my Mr Coffee @ $20, AT LEAST IT DOES THE JOB!...DONT BUY IT!...YOU'LL BE SORRY!"
1,Hazardous,"We bought this coffee maker due to the fact it had a thermal caraffe. That works great. Coffee stays warm for a long long time.But what good is that fact if the coffee is more often all over the counter than in the caraffe.Even with the top on straight - which is a hazzle, the part for the filter has to sit just right and if it doesn't it doesn't allign with the top of the caraffe and here comes the hot mess again.Also, if you use finely ground coffee it never makes the 12 cups - it flows over at cup 8 because it doesn't flow thru the filter fast enough.And the last thing that will stop us from buying this product again - the etched in writing on top of the lid that tells you open close and pour is nothing for bad eyes. My father in law poured the entire hot pot over his hand because he didn't see the little pour.If you want your coffee at the first try, without a mess and without getting burned -> DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,"Coffee lover, engineer, teacher","I bought this coffee maker in December 2011 after searching for a model that had the features I most wanted: (a) 12 cup capacity, (b) thermal carafe because some members of my household get up much later than others, (c) programmability. The first month, I was very pleased with how well it worked. However, BE WARNED! The lid of the thermal carafe soon begins to not mate well with the brew basket above, and coffee leaks down all over your counter and floor. I became obsessive about checking that the lid was placed on properly and was correctly aligned underneath the basket, but it did not help. I threw it away after about 3 month's use. This is the second model of Cuisinart coffee maker with thermal carafe that has failed in a similar fashion. I'm going back to a glass carafe model."
5,You must tighten the top,This is my 3rd Cuisinart coffee pot. The reviewers who had trouble with messy pouring: The top has embossed letters which are almost invisible. You have to tighten the top very tightly so that the pour arrow is over the spout and the pot pours perfectly. It feels like you are over turning the thread but it works! The clean up on this pot is so much easier than the Grind and Brew. I love it!
3,died after a year,"Decent coffee maker. Thermos kept coffee warm. The big issue, however, is that the maker just died after about 1 year. If you are a regular/daily coffee drinker & cannot go without your coffee, I do not recommend this item. Kitchen appliance, in excess of $100, should last for more than a year. Planned obsolescence has devolved into pathetic obscenity."
1,Terrible!,"This coffee maker didn't work the first time I used it. Water would leak out of the bottom of the machine (resevoir). Terrible, terrible quality from a supposedly good brand. If I could have given this zero stars I would have."
2,Not worth the price,"I did a lot of research and chose this coffee maker because it is one of very few that have a 12-cup stainless carafe. However, the coffee does not get hot enough (the heating plate turns off just a few minutes after it finishes brewing). Also, the beeping to signal that the coffee is done brewing is quite loud and sounds like my smoke detector. It looks nice, but does not make great coffee."
1,Hot Coffee but would rather have it in my cup and not all over the counter,I wanted a Thermal Carafe and this seemed like the best bet. The drip mechanism is very temperamental and have had mornings of coffee and coffee grounds floating across the counter f. Very disappointing for a $90 coffee maker. The coffee does stay hot for hours.
4,Works just fine,Have always liked Cuisinart. Price was good. Features what I was looking for. Coffee comes out nice and hot. Bought the 12 cup but usually only make ten to avoid the overflow problem. Only thing that is annoying is it pours slowly.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this coffee maker to replace my Capresso which I had for five years and made great coffee. The Cuisinart lasted four month before it died. The coffee dumping all over the counter also happened a couple of times. Clearly a flaw. I've returned a previously purchased Cuisinart product because of poor design and still own a food processor, which works great. But I will definitely never buy anything Cuisinart again. This coffee maker is junk!"
5,coffeelover,This is the second time we bought this make of coffeemaker. Keeps coffee hot for hours without sitting on a warming plate.
2,Kept flooding my countertop,"Not sure if it's the cone filter design, but the bottom of the filter would get coffee grinds stuck in it and it coffee would fill up, go over the top and flood my kitchen counter, once every month or two. Eventually replaced it out of frustration about a year after purchasing it. Tried a KitchenAid but that died just after the warranty ran out. Now I'm trying Capresso. Hopefully that will perform better!"
1,The worst,this coffee maker is hard to use - to screw the lid on the vacuum you must be well coordinated and strong. No one else in the family can make coffee as they get the lid on screwy and therefore it will not drip except all over the counters and floor. The screw on top design is cumbersome and if you are older and have problems with arthritis it would be impossible.
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASE!!!,"I have had this coffeemaker just a little under a year and in that time I have had it overflow probably 2 dozen times!!! I keep it very clean and rinse all the parts, take special care to get it in the right position and STILL it clogs up and gets coffee and grounds all over! PLEASE save yourself the trouble and choose a different coffeemaker. This one is so bad I wouldn't even donate it, I'm throwing it away."
5,Better than I hoped,"My husband has wanted a coffee maker with thermal carafe. I read the reviews on this one. Most were very positive, a few just the opposite. I purchased one for Father's Day. It is excellent. Easy to use, makes great coffee and keeps it hot!"
4,Although some days it is a one star machine,"We have had this coffee maker for 5-6 years, a long distance study if you please.We make coffee everyday, one full pot or more. This pot has worked wonderful, Hot, Great tasting and consistant. Exept when it explodes! I make the coffee every morning somewhere between 5 and 6 in the morning and I always know how my day is going to go weather the coffee all goes into the carafe or on the counter and floor.It will, as other have mentioned, work for a long strech of time and then one day things will go wrong!The break down is starting to happen more often now so I'm looking for a new pot, but am very warry of choosing a different one."
4,Pros and Cons,"Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Programmable Automatic Brew-and-Serve 12-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker, BlackPros; Makes great coffee. Keeps coffee Hot.Cons; Has a oblong filter basket. Should use more expensive coffee filters. Doesn't use regular coffee filters(you can use them BUT the grids, sometimes slip into the coffee)The 10 cup maker COMES WITH the gold mesh filter. You can also purchase this filter at Amazon(which I should have).Also, after a month of use(or so)the little rubber gasket, that's inside the filter basket popped off. Can't order just that part. You must order the whole basket."
5,Cuisinart Thermal Coffee Maker,"This is the second one of these thermal coffee makers purchased, because we love it. It is easy to use, clean and program, and because the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for hours, I can refill our coffee cups without having to go back and forth to the kitchen. We just take it with us where we are having our coffee, which could be in the back patio or when having lunch on the front terrace."
4,"So Far, So Good","Cuisinart coffeemaker has met expectations thus far. Makes a good cup of coffee and thermal carafe keeps it hot. Fill tank is a little inconvenient to get to, since the coffeemaker is relatively tall, but this is a minor complaint."
5,"Great, simple, coffeemaker","My husband and I were looking for a coffeemaker with the following features: 12 cup capacity, thermal carafe, programmable. We didn't want a grinder or any other features that would require repair later on. This coffeemaker fit the bill! Simple and easy to use along with a carafe to keep the coffee warm and to top it all off, it makes a great cup of coffee!"
1,Critical flaw - WARNING to those with staggered wakers,"We purchased the Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker so that my cup of Joe would be ready when I wake up at 4:00am and the thermos would keep the remainder hot for my wife when she gets up at 6:00. The problem is that when my coffee is brewed the Cuisinart lets the entire household know with a VERY loud and sustained beeping. It wakes up my wife and two kids. There is no option to turn off the alarm, which gives me no option but to go back to the French press. It's hard to believe I'm the only one in the world in this situation."
3,BROKEN AGAIN,"I HAD THIS COFFEE POT FOR 13 MONTHS, THEN IT DIED. IT WOULD TURN ON BUT NOT BREW. I LOVE THE WHOLE CARAFE THING, SO I ORDERED ANOTHER. THIS ONE ONLY LASTED 3 WEEKS. I AM VERY DISSAPPOINTED."
3,Coffee Maker w/ Carafe,"I was looking for a Carafe that would keep coffee hot, and read the reviews on this product as well as others. This product was indicated to be superior in that respect. I am not impressed with the level of warmth, but will concede others might not want their coffee as warm as I do."
3,Not as good as expected,"I did careful research before purchasing this coffee maker, which was highly rated, but I am disappointed because it doesn't keep the coffee hot as long as I would expect for a thermal carafe. Also, the ""pause"" feature that is supposed to allow you to pour while it's still brewing, doesn't always work. The coffee comes out well, though."
2,Keep the box . . . it'll help if you need to return it to the factory,"Makes great coffee, and the thermal carafe is excellent; keeps the coffee hot for a long time.But, we are currently on our 3rd unit, after having the first 2 coffeemakers fail . . . after 2 months each; heating unit just stopped working each time. To their credit, the factory service people were quick to send us replacement units, but it was still a hassle to pack it up, and worse, to be without a coffeemaker for a week! Since we live in California, there was no charge to ship it back; if you live in another state they charge you $10.The unit comes with a one year factory warranty, and I am curious to see if this third unit makes it to a year; I kept the box for the purpose of returning it when/if that becomes necessary."
3,Be Caregul,"Maker is okay, but as stated numberous times here, WATCH FOR COFFEE OVERFLOW. What a mess. The mechanics are to unforgiving if not placed exactly right."
3,don't like cold coffee,This coffee maker does not keep coffee hot very long. The thermal carafe does not retain temperture even if you fill with hot water before brewing.
4,Too Tall but otherwise GREAT,"This just barely fits on the counter beneath our kitchen cabinets so I would definitely prefer a shorter coffee pot. Otherwise, is is perfect. I love the fact that the coffee remains hot in the thermal pot, allowing the heating element to turn off automatically once the coffee is made. Waking in the morning to the smell of coffee that has automatically brewed on schedule is a delight!"
1,Puddles on the counter,Boo. Ever since the first time we created a coffee puddle (more like a lake) all over the counter we have been incredibly diligent in putting the carafe lid in the correct position. The lid or filter must be incredibly sensitive and it is MUCH easier to make coffee puddles all over the counter than in the pot. Making coffee shouldn't be this hard. Thank God we still have the original packaging- this is going back.
1,"Very slow, frequent overflows","When this thing works, it makes good coffee and keeps it warm for hours. However, at least once a week it inexplicably jams and overflows if I make the mistake of walking away while it's brewing. This is in a high-tech company office. People here are more than smart enough to operate a coffee maker, but even if everything is assembled and aligned correctly, and even if it *starts* fine, it still sometimes just backs up and spills coffee and grounds everywhere.Plus, it's unimaginably slow, so when I wait 10+ minutes for the coffee to finish brewing, then come back into the kitchen to see it erupted again, I'm not real excited to have to spend 5-10 minutes cleaning the counter and floor before I go through the whole process again. Instead I usually take the elevator down 29 flights, walk a block, buy a cup of coffee, then reverse the trip and I'm still way ahead on time. Plus no cleanup!"
4,Solved overflow problem,"I had several overflows with my first coffee maker (DTC-975BKN). What I mean about an overflow, is when the grounds float up and over top of the filter and then plug the top of the carafe. This inturn causes the coffee to go all over the counter and floor. I contacted Cuisinart and they sent me a replacement. I had several overflows with the replacement unit. My wife finally tried using bottled water and we have not had an overflow problem since. Once in a while we have tried regular tap water and it will float the grounds up to the top of the filter and some grounds will go into the pot. We go back to the bottled water and no problem. The grounds will be down about 1 1/2 inches from the top of the filter. I hope this helps some of unhappy owners. We now love our coffee.I wish someone would explain why the bottled water does not cause a overflow."
1,"1 star for machine, 5 stars for the coffee it makes when...","...it doesn't spill over. We got this coffee pot in January. It makes great coffee. Unfortunately, if you don't fit the carafe EXACTLY on the machine (which is impossible to determine), coffee will spill everywhere. It also seems to be more sensitive to a finer grind. The upper part, once it backs up, makes the grounds go everywhere. It has required major cleaning in our kitchen - countertop and the three drawers under it and the floor. I don't know how long the warranty lasts, but will check. Cuisinart customer service gets very iffy reviews, and it is too late to send it back to Amazon."
2,Great... when it worked,"When it worked, this was a great coffee maker. Coffee does stay hot in the carafe. Unfortunately, ours stopped working in less than a year, which makes the carafe kind of useless. Maybe it was just the unit, but I am a bit hesitant to try again, given the cost."
1,Unreliable,"As other reviewers have stated, this machine makes a good cup of coffee. Sadly, it is completely unreliable. My fourth machine just died after less than a year. The machines just quit working....turn it on, it sits a few minutes and turns off. The previous machines were replaced under warranty, however I had to pay $10.00 + shipping for each return. I'm done. Not even gonna bother trying to get a replacement for this piece of junk. Don't buy this coffee maker."
3,Make a good cup of coffee but....,"We're very happy w/this coffee maker, but it doesn't compare w/our old loved but worn looking Krupps. Though this was the only 12 cup maker w/a thermos carafe we could find, there are a few downsides. The carafe is stainless so even though the coffee stays hot all day, by mid day it tastes of metal. Big bummer! The only other problem is that the filter doesn't fit very well - you kind of have to push it into place. In contrast to other reviews, we have had no problem w/the screw on top - pretty easy to master! Over all, not bad except for the metal tasting coffee!"
1,Save your money!!!,"I owned this coffee maker for about 3 years. Soon after I purchased it and made coffee, the area in which you put the coffee would overflow and clog the carafe. This means that when you try and move the coffee maker, the coffee, which is still in the filter area spills everywhere. This happened QUITE a few time and one of the times the hot coffee spilled on my husband's and caused 2nd degree burns. I called Cuisinart and they sent me a replacement part for the filter area but that did not fix the problem. Two years into it, it stopped making hot enough water for the coffee so the brewed coffee was just awful.I threw it away today."
2,cuisnart thermal coffee on the counter,"Great coffee but you have to occasionally wake up with brewed coffee all over your counter, cabintes and floor. Other than that, the coffe is great !"
1,don't make the same mistake I did,"Fool that I am, I bought 2 of these coffee makers. We generally liked the model. It kept the coffee really warm, not burnt tasting, and we had no other complaints, until the coffee started spewing over the carafe, much like the other reports here. After numerous phone calls to Cuisinart, with very long wait times, we cleaned out the unit as instructed but the problem continued. We attributed this problem to the fact that the coffee maker was dropped during our kitchen renovation, and that it was probably our fault. Bought another one, and about 4 months later had the same problem. I agree with the other reviewers - it doesn't take a rocket scientist to screw a cap on correctly, and make sure the filter and all of its parts are in the right place. However, we had no trouble operating it for a few months, and for what we paid, it should practically run to Starbucks for me and buy me a latte, which is what I have to do until my new, non Cuisinart model arrives."
1,Leaks,"You must be very careful with this machine. If the basket isn't snugly in place, and often times it feels like it is, but it truly isn't, your coffee will leak all over. Even after reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. It leaked all over my counter, floor, inside my lazy susan cabinet and was a complete mess in the morning before work when all I wanted was my cup of coffee. Then, it will NOT stop brewing mid-stream for you to fill your cup like the manual states. It keeps on dripping. I'm returning this after owning it for 1 week."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This thing is awful. In my opinion, if one grind makes it through your filter or if the planets don't line up in a million other ways it just spits coffee and grinds out all over your counter. I've actually used 2 of these, they both are exactly as bad as one another and anyone considering this item should buy anything else. You couldn't make a worse choice than this one. I would prefer a hammer, beans and a boiling pot of water."
1,Coffee Tastes Terrible,"If you read the manual that comes with this product, they ask you to use 2TB of coffee per cup of water. That's about a cup and a half of coffee for the full 12 cup run. That's double what any other drip machine recommends. I can't imagine that much coffee even fitting in the basket. What they know about their coffee maker is that it makes WEAK coffee. Either the water doesn't get hot enough, or the water doesn't get spread over the grounds evenly enough, but the upshot is it comes out like tea. That would be enough to recommend against this coffee maker. However, the worst part is that the coffee this machine makes also has a horrible metallic taste. This machine makes horrible, undrinkable not-coffee."
4,Be Careful,"This makes delicious coffee that stays hot for most of the day without becoming ""scorched"" from being on a hot burner all day. Just be sure you place the filter in carefully so that it snaps in place and screw the lid on the carafe, otherwise you will have coffee all over your counter top and floor, and you will need to get every single ground out of the filter holder before it will work properly again. If you are one to be slightly careless about screwing on lids and such, think twice about this purchase."
4,Has it's quirks but I like it,"Because I hate burnt tasting coffee I was left with me with few thermal choices. It was between the Cuisinart and the Zojirushi. The dealbreaker for the Cuisinart is that it has a loud alarm when coffee is done...not good when I have 2 sleeping kids. So after 3 months of the Zojirushi here's what I've found:It seems to make weaker coffee than my old cheap maker.To mitigate this, I found that if I add warm water instead of cold, it tastes better/stronger.The carafe keeps coffee hot for a couple hours...after 8 hours, it's warm/cold.I had one flow-over because I ground the coffee too fine and it clogged the filter...my fault.It makes exactly 6 Measuring Cups, which is enough for me and my wife in the morning.I think if Cuisinart were smart, they'd disable that alarm. I probably would have purchased it."
2,Great coffee but broke down,"We have had this coffee maker for six monthsIt makes a great coffee and we love the carafeHowever it stopped working completely after six months. It can be replaced under warranty but it would normally take 7-10 business days to get a replacement and they are on back order so it will take longer plus I have to pay the shippingFor a couple that likes and needs their coffee, this is a joke!!"
5,LOVE>>LOVE>>LOVE,"I researched a lot of coffeemakers before I bought this one..Although some people had trouble with getting the top on, I haven't had that problem...Makes really great coffee, is ready when I get up, and keeps it hot....I would definitely reccomend this coffeemaker."
1,Very disappointed,"Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Thermal Coffeemaker 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, BlackThis coffee maker is the first product purchased from Amazon that I have not been satisfied with. It just quit after 10 months of use. We make two pots of coffee per day so I don't believe it was over used, but nevertheless, it just quit working. The lid on the carafe was also shoddy as it broke the first week we had it."
1,Overflows,"This coffemaker would be the best on the planet, except for as others have written about once every 2-3 weeks it will inexplicably overflow all over the kitchen counters and floor. I grind the beans the same, have the lid lined up, I have no idea why this happens, but it is a mess. It pretty much ruined the grout in our kitchen floor. Do not buy it."
2,Broken switch in 6 months,Today is December 19 and this coffee maker arrived June 11- almost exactly 6 months. Now the on-off switch appears to be broken and one must stand by it to keep turning it back on in order to get a full pot of coffee. Need a new one and it won't be THIS one! We liked it while it worked!
1,Faulty Top,"I have had this coffee maker for 4 months. We have had repeated problems with the top plugging, hot water backing up in the basket and a mess of water and coffee grounds all over the counter.We have tried everything including rinsing water through the top and rinsing the basket prior to each use and the random failures continue. Although the pot functions well otherwise, this one failing makes the unit basically unusable. We are purchasing another coffee maker."
2,"Great coffee, but lasted 1 month","We've been waiting 8 days for the warranty replacement and Starbucks is costing me a fortune because I can't make my own coffee. I sure hope the new one lasts longer. 2 stars for good hot coffee. Minus three for lasting about a month.Since this machine doesn't need to stay on after brewing (because it has a thermal carafe) it has an automatic shut off after brewing. That's a great feature except after we filled it with water and turned it on, about 30 seconds later it would beep and turn itself off as if it were finished ."
1,I hate this thing!!!,About 3 times a week it get clogged and over fills making a huge mess. It's probably great for 2-4 cups but it gets clogged when you try to make 10-12 cups. Bad engineering.
4,DS6366,"WOW, we love this coffee maker. Its quick, quiet, and the thermal pot keeps coffee hot for eight plus hours. Never have to worry about having a warming tray on. The only drawbacks are 1) its too tall to fit under the upper cabinets and 2) contributing to that tallness is the use of conical paper filters which are more expensive than a standard filtersCuisinart DTC-975BKN Programmable Automatic Brew-and-Serve 12-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker, Black."
2,only lasted nine months,"The carafe has such a small opening that you can't get your hand inside to clean it properly. The top is difficult to screw on correctly, especially first thing in the morning before you've had a cup of coffee! Other than that, it worked pretty well for nine months. It does keep the coffee very hot for hours, which is nice. But after nine months, it started overflowing for no apparent reason. Then smoke started coming out of it! No more Cusinart products for me. I am sick of buying a new coffee maker every year -- can't anyone design a decent product?"
4,great - BUT....,Pros: keeps coffee hotcoffee never gets burnt tastelarge carafe sizetimerCons: too talltricky lid/basket combo- will create mess if not perfectly lined upI am an able bodied person with a college degree and I STILL had problems with getting the coffee pot to work properly without coffee spilling out all over. what a mess! I got so disgusted I started putting the coffee pot in the sink because I was afraid to use it. I have now mastered the very touchy lid/ basket alignment and love the coffee pot to death. But the learning curve was terrible. I recommend starting with the pot in the sink until you are SURE you know how to set it up properly.
3,Okay coffeemaker,"I have used a Black&Decker programable coffeemaker with thermal carafe for a number of years. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it only made 8 cups. I therefore decided to replace it with this Cuisinart model. I like the sleek look and metal carafe (as opposed to glass). It does make very good coffee. However... I find screwing the lid on the carafe very fussy. I had to put a touch of nail polish where it says pour because with the black it's impossible to read. Nothing is as easy to deal with (filling, etc.) as the Black&Decker I had. I also wish I could disconnect the infernal beeping that occurs (5 or 6 beeps) when it is finished brewing - totally unneccessary!! Other than the sleek design (which you have to pull out from under the cabinet to fill due to height) the only thing this machine has over Black & Decker is that it makes 12 cups. I'll stick with it, but not the great buy I thought it was."
1,Failure of engineering,"As previously noted, the carafe itself is great, but the spring mechanism in the bottom of the basket jams unless carefully cleaned after each use. Ours has overflowed all over our counter, cabinet and floor at least five times now. We are currently shopping for a new machine and would recommend that everyone avoid this model."
1,Great - when it works. (Which is rare.),"My third (THIRD!) replacement of this coffeemaker just broke this morning. Stopped working. Kaput. Just like the other reviewers have said, it sent coffee all over the counters and the floor, rather than in the pot. Seeing as I've had this coffeemaker replaced THREE TIMES by Cuisinart, and each of them broke in EXACTLY the same way, there is most certainly a flaw in the design. They said after the last replacement that they wouldn't be sending me any more. And, honestly? I wouldn't want a Cuisinart coffeemaker if they paid me to take it.When it works, the coffee is decent tasting, and the carafe is fantastic. At least that part will go to some good use. The rest of it is meeting the dump."
3,Expected a bit more,"Cuisinart usually makes very high quality products. I was looking to replace my Krups thermal coffee maker. The Krups all got bad reviews so I bought the Cuisinart which had mixed reviews. It is not bad, but the thermal container does not keep the coffee as hot as I would like for a very long time. I suspect the thermal insulation is too thin (cheap). Second, the machine is touchy when it comes to keeping the filter from folding over, and when it does, it overflows onto the counter. Other than that, it is OK. I just expected a better machine than what I got. My old Krups was better, but it was 7 years old and heavily used, and it finally gave up."
2,The problems are true!,"The coffee this machine makes tastes great, and the thermal caraffe does keep it warm all day. But if you use a gold filter instead of paper, you WILL eventually end up with the coffee-all-over-the-counter-and-floor situation. My husband is so shell shocked that he puts the whole machine in the sink to brew, and I'm shopping for a new one now. It's too bad, too; Cuisinart is a great company. I really wish they could make this gold filter-compatible."
1,Warning!!!,The reviews are correct!!! If you buy this machine it will overflow. You will get coffee grinds and coffee everywhere!!! You were warned!! What a waste of time and money.
2,For a $100 it should have a filter basket.,"This coffeemaker would have been my third Cuisinart. I was really looking forwarded to a thermal carafe. Upon opening the package I discovered that this model did not come with a ""gold"" filter basket. It uses paper cone filters. For a $100 Cuisinart should include a filter basket as the do in their other models. Other than the thermal carafe it plastic and feels very cheaply made. I will be returning it and ordering another model."
5,THE ONE AND ONLY,"The search is over, THANK HEAVEN! After buying, trying and returning FIVE coffemakers in one month - this is it. As Brazilian coffee snobs, our expectations are high - our hopes were fading.Buy this model ONLY. We also tried out the two much higher-end Cuisnarts, including the ones with built-in grinders. Those also, for some bizarre reason, have basket filters - YUCK! Even super high end burr-grinder model (at nearly triple the price) was a dud and didn't come close to a decent espresso grind... just grind you own at Trader Joe's or buy an expensive, heavy duty burr grinder and be done with it. This one has it all - cone filter, decent capacity, and coffee stays hot LONG ENOUGH!! We might just buy 4 or 5 to take us through to our old age! Also, another post mentioned slight leakage (user error!) - we've had ours for over two months now and this had never happened - just line everything up properly."
4,Coffee maker,"This coffeemaker is great, very economical as it shuts off after it is finished brewing and the coffee stays HOT for hours in the urn. No 'burner' to go bad after years of use. The only problem we have had is if the filter isn't sitting perfectly right in the basket and the water misses going through it, the water overflows onto the counter,etc. We will purchase a gold filter (if cuisinart makes one for this model). So far, all the specs I've seen for the gold filters do not include this model so I sent a message to the company. It should come with one for the price...and the economics."
3,Planned Obsolescence?,"Impressed at the house of a friend who had this, got one for myself in 2007.While it worked, I loved it. It did indeed, as advertised, keep the coffee hot and tasting fresh for hours.As other reviewers have pointed out, the top can be a little tricky to get on properly, but I expected to get used to this and for the most part did.How long should products last in the 21st century? That is something you will have to decide. I do know that I had my previous garage-sale purchased coffeemaker for 12 years.This one lasted just three months past the 3-year warranty expiration date. All of a sudden the vacuum seems to have gone out of the carafe and it no longer insulates at all. This happened without warning and without any misuse or abuse of the product. One day it worked, the next it didn't.My 3 star review is an average of: 5 stars for when it worked, and one star because I believe that a hundred-dollar coffeemaker should last more than 3 years."
1,Broke in 2 weeks,This coffee pot broke soon after we got it. The plastic handle/top peeled off the metal part. We tried gluing it back together but it only held for a couple of days. I just got done packing it up to return to Amazon. I will never buy another Cuisinart product again. The $25 Mr.Coffee lasted for years!!!!!
4,Tall coffee maker,"So fare the pot works well, the pot is a little taller than most coffee makers so it is about an inch to tall to fit under the standard hight of upper cabins. The pot is easier to use with the cone shaped filters."
4,Keeps coffee hot without cooking it,"The thermai coffee pot keeps the coffee hot for an extened period of time without the need for a hot plate which ""cooks"" the coffee if used."
3,Decent coffee maker,"We're generally please with the coffee maker. I think Cuisinart has overextended it's brand. I used to think Cusinart products were well designed and well made. I no longer feel this way.The coffee maker makes decent coffee and the thermal carafe does keep it warm. We've had for about 2-years now and the black paint covering the portion of the coffee maker where the clock and the controls are, is beginning to rub off. This is a poor design. The coffee maker is beginning to look a bit tacky as the paint rubs off.Other than that, we've been pretty happy with it."
3,Cuisinart Coffee Cooler,"This is a caraf coffee maker. The caraf, unfortunately, doesn't keep the coffee hot for any appreciable time. If you are around when the coffee is made, then fine. It is great coffee. Unfortunately, within the next half hour, you are well on your way to iced coffee."
1,Horrible Machine!,"I thought about contacting the corporate office and could'nt find any info. on where to find them. I have had the same problems - over flow for no reasons what so ever. I also have a problem with trying to get the coffee grinder container out of its' holder. I simply cannot do it. Once in a rare moment it will release its self, but currently we have to use ground coffee and by pass the grinding feature. We've used plyers to try to get that cotainer out to no avail - I forgot to mention this.We have a consumer radio show here in Denver, and the host decided to invite all of his listners to bring their ""Lemons"" ( things around the home that were garbage from the day they bought them ) to his parking lot on a specific day. The host had a steam roller truck that he was using to run over all of these items the consumers were sick of having. You guessed it - a lady had a Cuisinart Coffee Maker!!! How I wished I could have brought mine and watched it die a slow death!So, do not buy one!!!"
2,Weak coffee that spills all over the counter,"We used this product trouble free for about 4 months.On the positive side, it uses a lot less electricity because there is no hot plate to keep warm.On the negative side, the cover leaks. So you always get a few drops of coffee on the counter whenever you pour a cup.On the really negative side, it has started dumping coffee all over the counter and floor like many other reviewers have mentioned. We cleaned the cover and checked the mechanisms. I don't see anything obviously wrong with it.I also wish we had known before purchasing that the coffee is very weak and there is no way to control the strength. To get a robust cup, you need to use a lot of extra coffee which may offset any savings you are getting on your electric bill."
1,Do not buy this horrible machine!,"I just spent hours cleaning up the horrible mess this thing made. It was spewing everywhere and wouldn't stop even after unplugging. Made sure all parts were in properly, tried again and it did the same thing. Awful! This was after using for only 2 weeks.I would give this coffeemaker a zero if the rating would register. That is the only reason I gave it a one star."
1,Leaks Badly,"This coffee pot leaks badly when making coffee. I take it apart between uses and was it, being careful to make sure all the coffee grounds are removed and something interferes with the water getting into the pot. I have had other Cuisinart Thermal pots and had the same issue."
2,"Great brand, but lousy quality.","While it makes good coffee, the stop and serve function rarely works, most of the time it just keeps pouring coffee out of the filter basket. At least with no heating plate it's not burning on that, but if you want a cup before it's finished better have a towel handy.Many have complained about the lid, and I even read the reviews with an eye toward skepticism, I mean surely if you take care to screw it on straight, it will go on all the way and seal right? Well, I've cross threaded this thing a dozen times, I've always seen it and removed the lid and started over, but the threads on this lid and container are not the easiest to get going correctly. But, then it could be a test of how addicted to coffee we are, can't do it maybe your really Jonesing too much for that first cup.It's the basic ""defects"" in either manufacturing quality or design quality and cause the low rating."
2,Coffee maker from Hell.,"We got this coffee maker because of its large capacity. When it works, it works quickly and well. However, either the little gold filter basket or the ball in the lid can malfunction and stop the flow of coffee into the pot. 12 cups of brown liquid mingled with grounds all over the counter and floor is not a pretty sight. Of course, it only strikes when you are in a hurry and don't carefully check that all the coffee is going in the right spot. After the clean-up this morning, the coffee maker is in the Goodwin pile."
2,Very Disappointed,"I've wanted a thermal coffeemaker for a long time, so when my old Gevalia coffeemaker stopped working I read all the reviews and picked this coffeemaker. At first it seemed ok but then I started having problems. The coffee doesn't come through the drip and sits in the top long after the signal goes off. Other times, the coffee doesn't go into the thermal pot at all and drips down the side. People said how hot the coffee is, but I don't think it's all that hot when it's first brewed. What a disappointment!"
5,Love this coffee pot,"I'm a true coffee drinker from morning til night. I LOVE THIS COFFEE POT. I made a pot at 8:30 am and still super hot at 3:30 pm. Having 12 cups is much better than 10. It is easy to make coffee, brews fast, great taste. If those who wrote bad reviews had followed directions, they wouldn't have any problems. I have been using it about a month and hope they never stop making this design."
2,"Terrible design flaw, but occasionally great coffee","This coffee maker makes terrific coffee and keeps it piping hot, but is too uneven to continue using. I can't tell you how many times I, or someone else at work, has had to mop up gallons of coffee because the machine didn't work right. First off, the coffee does not drain properly through the filter--often leaving two cups of coffee just hanging there. We use the correct grind of coffee and it works about 70% of the time, so it's a design flaw. Also, the coffee inexplicably drains all over the counter instead of into the pot. Checking the pot reveals that the lid is on correctly and nothing is amiss--but still the malfunction. I am returning this pot--too bad!"
2,Little to recommend,"There is only one positive for this product - it makes hot coffee. Otherwise it would get a single star. The taste is thin with little body, even when using more beans than with our previous maker (Hamilton Beach - at half the price). In addition, the basket is prone to overflow when making close to a full pot. If the pot isn't perfectly centered under the basket, grounds loose, etc. watch out. It is also unnecessarily tall and won't fit under lower above-counter cabinets. We recently found out my wife's cousin bought one and has experienced the same overflow situation. At this price, try something else.Cuisinart DTC-975BKN Programmable Automatic Brew-and-Serve 12-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker, Black"
5,Great condition!,"The book came so quickly and besides a few words written in the pages, it's in great condition! Thank you!"
1,Junk science by the Jesus Seminar,"Keep in mind that the main contributors in this film is the people from the Jesus Seminar, who are a self-appointed group of so called ""scholars"". Some are atheists and some are hardly scholars (one is a filmmaker).The group's founder is an atheist called Robert Funk. The way they establish what Jesus said and didn't say/do is by a majority vote using colored marbles.One member, John Dominic Crossan claims that Jesus was buried in a shallow grave, dug up by dogs and eaten!The entire production has a premise of debunking the Bible, fine debunk it all you want, but bring TRUE evidence if you can, not this non-sense from the Jesus seminar. Enough said."
5,The best of the Ginnie books,"Thiw was my first Ginnie book. I read a few others based on my enjoyment of this book but the other books were forgettable. This one deals with the loneliness of a latch key kid, how you attract friends by standing on your own two feet and finding your own happiness and about the importance of children learning to run the house."
2,So so...,"Calling this a leather punch set is a bit of a stretch. Useful for thin vinyl or a tissue if you want to put grommets on that type of material. If your wanting to do leather, keep looking."
1,not practical,"Contrary to the product picture, I cannot put the scale to 0 with the bowl on. And the little wheel to adjust that 0 is harming my fingers. So I am not using it that much. Glad it was cheap at least."
3,Surprisingly disappointing,"With the exception of 'Feet like Fins', this collection of songs is a dissapointment for those who really enjoy early masterpieces such as ""Pink Opaque"" and ""Head over Heels"". Like an experiment gone bad. Fortunately they worked their way through this and evolved to create 'Blue Bell Knolls'!"
4,Great Stories and Great Pictures,"My mom & step dad bought me this while on their honeymoon in Carmel in 1978 (I was 8 at the time). I loved it so much that it must be handled with care these days. Grimms fairy tales aren't necessarily for everyone. Several are very dark, but I truly enjoyed them. And who can beat Maurice Sendak as an illustrator???"
5,Who can top Sendak for fairy tale power?,"If I had any one visual image deep in my brain when I began to write Take Me With You When You Go, it was Sendak's illustration in this collection of Hansel and Gretel lost in the woods, which I'd read and seen many years before. No one has illustrated fairy tales more richly than Sendak, and the collection he chose to combine is good, and Lore Segal's telling is fine. This is one of the best entry points for children into real fairy tales, as opposed to Disney. My own book attempts to bridge beyond Grimm and the older fairy tale tradition, but at the heart there's still the closely bonded Brother and Sister growing strong together on their own....Good grief! I just noticed that another one of the stories in the collection is actually titled ""Brother and Sister."" I'd totally forgotten."
3,Warning: Bait and Switch!!!,"I spent my hard-earned money on this movie, and sat through an eternity of talky scenes, and Bette Davis acting all catty and cheap, just to get to the bondage scenes.Well, THERE AREN'T ANY! NOT ONE BONDAGE SCENE AT ALL! I was waiting for the scene in which Bette Davis dons her dominatrix getup, and has Leslie Howard down on the floor at the tip of her whip, bound in a leather harness, with a gag in his mouth.I'm here to tell you: YOU CAN SAVE YOUR MONEY, BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THERE! Not even Bette Davis in a catsuit!Spend it instead on ""Buxom Bondage Club,"" which you can find in the DVD section here at amazon.This movie is a RIPOFF!!!!!!!!"
5,Judo Book,"This is one of the old, simple books on Judo. No frills and no extended theory. Just the real stuff done by men who know the sport. This is a great book for any Judo student to learn from and to keep as a reference. Bought a bunch of them as gifts for my Judo students."
4,Good for those new to the Sport and Art of Judo,"Shows the basic Judo moves and techniques in an east to follow format. Starting with how to fall properly to basic and intermediate throws and counter throws. I would recommend this book to people new to Judo and high school/college wrestling, due to it's simplicity and to-the-point photos and movement explainations."
3,Almost there,"Thought there would be more detailed "" how to"" portions with illustrationsLots of spelling and grammar mistakesIntro was well done"
4,Judo,"very good book for beginning judoka etiquette and ukemi brief history, are well presented. positiones on tachi waza have advanced somewhat since this book was written."
2,Not Much Good To Say About This One...,"Outdated in terms of both content and illustration, and there are much better Judo books out there to spend your money on (see my other reviews)."
3,Needed more of a human angle,I can look on the Internet and see that the Tigers went 35-5 and read the stats. What I'd like to read about is the players' and fans' reactions to some of the things. What went on the in the Clubhouse when the Mariners swept the Tigers (I attended those games)? How did the the team react when their 8.5 game lead was cut to 3.5 in less than two weeks? What was it like in the Clubhouse after the Tigers swept in Toronto? I can read on the Internet that they had this winning streak and that losing streak and so on and this guy hit lots of homers and that guy struck out a lot but I really was expecting more of a human angle.
4,George Cantor Gets it Right,"I remember the '84 and the '68 seasons, and I was old enough during both to get caught up in the fervor of the pennant drives and the subsequent world series. 1968 was more emotional, by far, but Mr. Cantor rekindles not only memories but gives us the nuances behind the box scores. It was great to go back in time and remember how the team was put together and that fantastic start. Wow, 35 and 5. While nothing will ever replace the raw emotion of 1968, 1984 was a very good year, and the book is a must read for any true Tiger fan."
1,7 keto DHEA,"I have to be honest. I heard about the product on Dr. Oz. It was said to be all natural, no side effects, just results. Well I got the product home, and guess what? Half of the bottle was filled with horrible side effects. It scared me so bad that I never even tried it. None of side effects showed up when I purchesed the product. I will check more closely the next time."
1,Don't waste the money,This product was a waste of my time and money. I take it as directed and has not helped at all. I run a mile everyday on top of my daily activities as well as walking the dogs a mile. I have not lost any weight since taking this supplement and exercising. I do not feel that my metabolism has changed at all. Still hungry at all the same times and still have the same appetite. I am not over weight but would like to lose a few pounds for the summer season. I would not recommend this product to others.
1,Floor Vent,"They sent the wrong size twice, and expected me to pay to ship them back. I did not! Would not recomend this product."
4,Tall Dark and Dangerous,Book actually had 3 short stories from the Wild West.This book contained the last story I needed to complete Catherine Anderson novels.If u like short stories this book is for u!
3,"Kee's other ""Vanished Art""","While I can't comment on this book or his poetry with any authority, I would like to point out another facet to Kees' creativity to those who are interested - he was also an amazingly accomplished painter. The artworks illustrated in recent book, ""The Writer's Brush,"" were my first introduction to him, and they every bit as compelling and interesting as anything else being produced at that time, if not moreso."
2,Ordered these pans twice----Still no lids!,THE ONLY REASON I EVER ORDERED THESE PANS IS BECAUSE THEY COME WITH THE LIDS.. !!.. Pans this size are hard to find lids for & for the PRICE aren't WORTH it without LIDS... This pan as decribed is to come with LIDS. But I've ordered them twice 4 pans in all & still no LIDS.. So I'm requesting a Refund this time.. I have purchased many of these pans from this company & they are very nice . Well worth the Price.. TOO BAD THIS PAGE IS MISLEADING.. I'm Ready when they get LIDS!! Reason for only two stars is NO LIDS... The Pan Rocks..
1,"Duh! Can we READ, people!? --","The packaging reads: ""The BEST of . . . .""That obviously means ""incomplete,"" DUH!I'll wait for the complete."
3,"Uncensored, my ******!","Don't get me wrong. I'm glad they came out with this set. The bonus features are great. But, all I found was one uncut episode(at least I think it was) which clocked in at about 51 minutes. Other episodes were about 41 minutes. One show was 39 minutes! Even Tommy Smothers admits on the audio introduction that these shows are edited. Remember the ""This Is Tom Jones"" DVDs? So tell me. What is the difference between ""uncensored"",""uncut"", and ""unedited""?"
3,Where's the beef ?,"I am astounded that this compilation does not include the 2 Beatle appearences, Steppenwolf, Spanky and Our Gang and a host of other musical groups. This is the Best of Season 3 ? I think not. I realy liked the Doors, Donovan and Mama Cass. But come on, where's the rest of this compilation ?"
2,Can hold a lot of scarfs but it's a hassle to get scarfs out.,"I bought this product to organize my scarfs. While this hanger can hold a lot of scarfs, it is not easy to get a particular scarf out from the stack."
5,Love me some Calphalon,"I've purchased the SS as a replacement for a non-stick Calphalon skillet that I enjoyed using. It's holding up well to my cooking style, which involves a fair amount of high-temp quick cooking that sears the meats I use. I only wish it could help when I set off my fire alarm due to the smoke!"
3,Brand Name that Sticks with YOU,"I bought this for my wife. I read reviews about pots/pans where non-stick coatings could be dangerous or peel off. While this is not a problem, the food sticks to this skillet like a magnet. My wife hates to use it because it is so hard to clean afterwards, but I would much rather prefer this than cookware that causes cancer!"
5,Woody Herman Story,This album presents a fine across-the-board collection of Woody Herman numbers. It's one of those that any old-time jazz fan should have in his or her possession.
2,"Pretty whimpy for the ""Thundering Herds""","I'm no expert on Herman's bands, but I have several other collections and this is far and away the whimpiest. Well over half the songs are sentimental ballads or comic novelty numbers. If you like those kinds of songs, this is your collection. But if you're looking for the up-tempo, full-tilt, straight ahead swing that (I thought) Herman was best known for, this is a big disappointment."
2,Frame,"It was ok. Can't fault the seller, was exactly what they said it was. Just wasn't that great of a frame to begin with."
3,Strange and Off-Putting....,"I generally have an open mind when it comes to quirky films, but this film took the cake...It may have helped somewhat if the dialogue hadn't been so mumbled half the time. On the other hand, the only reason I bought the film was for Alan Rickman, and I was not disappointed. He was superb, as always(!), and is THE ONLY reason to sit through this film (his Captain Hook was out of this world!). Also beware, the end may be a little squicky for some...."
1,Beware this movie,"I got this movie because I am a huge Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant fan and expected something well-acted and very British. Well, I got something well-acted and British, but I also got exposed to one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. It still haunts me. At the end my husband and I just looked at each other and said...""Surely not..."" We went back and watched the end again hoping we had missed something and it had caused us to misinterpret the end. Only Alan Rickman could have made me feel sorry for an incestuous cad and Hugh Grant as a bad guy is never a good idea. If you do not have a strong stomach for the mental abuse of women and children and men who don't ask the right questions - avoid this movie at all costs. It makes me cringe to think of it even six months later."
1,What is wrong with you?!,"This was disgusting! The storyline [stunk] because, lets face it, there was no story just a girl who looked like a 13 year old having sex with someone like 30 years older than her! AHHHH! And other things along that line. But, as usual, Alan Rickman, no matter how much I hated the movie, is a great actor. And Hugh Grant was good too. But not good enough to make me watch all of this disgusting and repulsive gibberish of a movie."
3,An Awfully Big Adventure,"This movie is definitely interesting! First off, it's fun to see Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman in their earlier years. This movie is darkly humorous. The reason the movie is worth watching is for the ending. What a shocker! It's truly jaw-dropping and changes the whole tone of the movie. However, the british accents are thick and the voices a tad low, so I would highly recommend turning on sub-titles. It's a good movie, and it is definitely worth watching."
3,An Awfully Strange Adventure,"Great performances by Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant. It's an interesting story, very offbeat. I'm not surprised it never hit the big time on the big screen, because in the end, it is completely disturbing.Those who are enamored of theater will be glued to the tube while this is playing. But those in the U.S. who have trouble with accents may be scratching their heads trying to understand some of the dialog (I found the uncle impossible to understand).This is not your run-of-the-mill movie about theater, though -- it's more like a horror story, only without a great deal of gore. And the bad guy wins in the end.Very sensitive types should watch something else."
4,Sexy Alan,"The movie was interesting...the first movie I've seen where Hugh Grant is a complete and utter A**!! Alan Rickman...which is WHY I got the movie comes in about half hr into it, but is gripping in the bits he's in...He doesn't speak for the first 5 min he's on screen, but his facial expressions tell you everything you need to know!You must have some knowledge of the ""British"" language and their eccentricities to keep up...Basically...if you adore Alan it is a must see!Seeing him on a motorcycle did it for me...& the ""lovemaking"" scenes were sexy & funny at the same time!"
3,This Is A Comedy?,"If this story of betrayal, indifference, sexual exploitation and general nastiness is a comedy (as the jacket proclaims), it is a VERY dark one. While the acting is very good generally (I found Cates as the young ""innocent"" to be a rather grating combination of boneheadedness and naivete), the story is slow moving in the first half and I found myself struggling to keep interested. However, after the arrival of O'Hara (Alan Rickman) things picked up all around even if they got even blacker. Rickman is an amazing actor who can make almost any character fascinating, no matter how dark he is and he certainly does that here. Grant, as the egotistic, nasty director is good in the part but not on the same level as Rickman. Overall, this movie seemed to have a split personality and didn't know whether it wanted to be bleak or funny. To me it was primarily bleak and the ending did not seem much of a surprise."
3,The most misleading jacket cover ever!,You would have to be disturbed to say that this is a warm hearted comedy. That said the performances in this warped story were the redeeming feature. Nice to see Hugh Grant in a role that is so different to the role he has been boxed into. Alan Rickman is superb.
3,Great condition - am finding it boring,"The DVD arrived very timely after I ordered it. The case is in perfect condition. I have not watched the entire movie, but what I have watched of it, the DVD works fine. I am finding the movie boring and I keep falling asleep while watching it."
4,Great flick!,I had to order it because nobody had a torrent on line. It's a great movie. Alan Rickman is legendary in this.
3,A Review...,"This book has a lot of good information for interior designers and anyone thinking about starting their own business, but it also has flaws. It is mostly text with no pictures. There are some spelling errors and a couple of sentences that do not make sense because of the way they are worded. This just makes it a little harder to read, but if you can look past these characteristics, you will learn a lot."
3,ok,"The CD was missing, the book was advertise as new for it was clearly used in a very good condition but used. shipping was late."
4,Italian Horn,Product was as advertised. Quality looks good. A bit more on the silver looking side then white gold. Overall I'm satisfied with purchase.
5,Creepy Chicago stories!,"Ursula B's one-of-a-series of ghstly tomes that is a great read, even for light fare. Nicely assembled collection of the goose-bumpiest of Chicago, that haunted twon on the lake.Fun creeps!"
3,Super Reader,"Jon Shannow has learned that he is not just a man. When an Atlantean king out of the ages appears to him in dreams and tells him of his mythic heroic destiny, and tells how he, Pendarric, loosed the bloodstones upon the world.An upstart gunslinger is looking to make a rep for himself by coming after Shannow, reliant on his speed.That is a minor problem, when a mystic time gate opens, letting loose all sorts of problems.Easily fixed. Easy, that is, if you call finding the Sword of God easy."
4,We finally learn about Atlantis!,"This book freaked me out. Books 1 and 2 of the Stones of Power series are centered around King Uther. Book 3 introduces the adventures of Jon Shannow.And Book 4? Book 4 of the Stones of Power series thrusts us into a continuation of crazy sci-fi, but adds a little religion to the mix. We learn more about Atlantis (finally!) as a portal is opened that exposes the modern tipsy-turvy world to Atlantis, a nation unknowingly on its death bed. A prophet from Atlantis flees to Shannow's land and sort of finds answers to questions he didn't even know he needed to ask. Shannow battles the forces of evil, quotes scripture, and somehow is connected to the mysterious revival taking place in other parts of the land.His ability to look back upon ""our"" time to see our mistakes is eye opening and a bit more than you bargain for in a futuristic novel. Eloquent and very well done fiction."
4,Jon Shannow rocks. He makes the Duke and Clint look weak!,"Jon Shannow is what every tough guy in the world wants to be. His sense of duty and faith unwavering, his skill unparalleled, nothing could stop the Jerusalem Man. He is a man who does what he thinks is right, when he thinks it. But the conflict within him eats him from inside. Jon Shannow is not a hero like with stars in his eyes holding up a flag, but more like an angel of death who gives out the appropriate penalties whenver they must be given. One of the reasons Jon Shannow always wins is because he always keeps his cool, no matter what he's up against. For this character alon this book is a must have."
3,It is okay but too small,Its okay but too small. The cloth to use it with is too skinny. I guess it would be okay with a very small sprain or wound.
2,Not the best value or performance in a cold pack,Bought this for icing my wrists after long days typing. The cold pack itself is too small and the wrapping system (synthetic felt with a piece of sticky-back Velcro) is a joke. Keep shopping and skip past this one.
4,good cold pack,I purchased this cold pack for my wife. Her foot swells and ice is the only thing that works right now till the doctors find the cause. I also bought a larger pack for my knee from the same manufacturer. Both work good but they don't last more than about 20 minutes. Actually you shouldn't ice any longer than 15 minutes so that's ok. They have gel inside and are flexible. Also a strap is included too. Another good thing is they freeze quickly. I gave them a 4 star because they don't last as long as ice but they are well made. I would buy them again if I needed another so I do recommend them.
2,Blah!,"This book is a great plug for canned soup companies. I expected better considering this is an ""Inn Bible of Southern Cooking"". This is just plain slop food."
5,blue willow inn bible of southern cooking,I gave this book as a gift and it was such a hit that I have ordered more books for others and also to use as a wedding gift. I like the recipes and also enjoyed reading the stories.
5,"""The Blue Willow Inn Bible of Southern Cooking...""","This cook book was an excellent choice! It is very informative, plus offers GREAT recipes."
5,Every southern recipe imaginable.,I definitely love Southern food. Most recipe books will have a couple Southern recipes here and there but not really what I was looking for. This one has everything!!! Most recipes are simple and delicious and don't take a long time or require lots of ingredients. A great cookbook for the novice to expert cook. Everyone should add this to their collection.
4,learning to cook,"I'm 27 and I'm trying to learn to cook. So far, all the recipes I've tried have been fairly easy and really yummy. I really like the index and substitutions information."
1,not very original or creative,Let me give an example of a recipe for lemonade: buy Country Time lemonade mix and add water. I expect a little more than that from any kind of cookbook.
1,It Don't Work,"It don't work on zombies. If yer buyin this duck tape for yer zombie apocalypse survival kit, I reckon you'd be better off juss to buy some regular duck tape from wally world. Yer welcome."
5,Good product,We have used this product in an outdoor application and it holds up quite well. Some has held over a year eventhough it has been exposed to the weather.
5,The Wisdom of the Hive,"As capitalism collapses around us and society falters, I began to get anxious about what supplies I should have on hand now that the turnips are planted. I was guided towards the 3M Nuclear Duct Tape, bound to be useful when the reactors start melting down, and then saw Amazon's superb ""What Did Customers Ultimately Buy After Viewing This Item"" list. I was thunderstruck! Of course! In the end times, I'm going to need an electric toothbrush, a Rubik's cube, and a Swiss Army knife! Not sure the Midnite Minichamp is the one I'd go for, though, it doesn't have a toothpick, and dental hygiene will be critical in the coming collapse. Maybe I'll get my Nuclear Duct Tape in red to match the knife, it always pays to look well put-together.Man, sure hope the tape is back in stock before Power Down."
2,Buy Two Rolls,"Alpha particles tend to seep through the gaps, so buy two rolls and overlap it quite a bit for a good radiation-free seal."
3,Not interested,I needed some duct tape to seal up a hole in my reactor but then I saw the Rubik's cube was on sale and opted to purchase that.
2,C'mon People!,"Stop with the corny joke reviews, please! ....Just Stop! Some of us would like to get real, usable information for such an (apparently) overpriced product."
2,"Way, WAY off","This is not $500 a ROLL. That is the case price.And to make matters worse, word on the street is 3M stopped certifying their product for nuke use. Basically, this is nothing more than high end duct. Plants now heavily use Nashua 357. There is some on the eVil auction site...Being in the duct tape business (I bet you didn't think there was anyone in the duct tape business) I know about this stuff. This posting is simply misinformation.Regular wholesale is about $12 a roll. Retail maybe a little more than that."
5,Triggering is fun.,"I just recently got into triggering my drums. For a while i researched a few drum modules and eventually came to the Alesis DM5. So far it's been fun. On my acoustic kit, i normally just trigger my bass drums. When it comes to electric, I use the Alesis with a cheap ION drum set. I use Ddrum Red shot triggers and together they work pretty well. The Module contains a good variety of sounds. I noticed on some other reviews about using the module. I don't think the module itself is hard to use. It just takes some time to getting use too. I kind of wish the DM5 had a feature so you could record your own sounds and use those, but that's ok. Overall, i recommend it."
5,A MUST READ,I checked it out at the library and I thought it was great! It really depicts what the earthquakes are like here in Calif.
3,The twins and thier friends are torn apart,I really like this book. I started getting choked up at the beginning when Jessica said Sam's name. I always liked him of Jessica's boyfriends. But I had to disagree of Olivia dying. I thought it was far-fetched that Olivia died and then is resurrected in Sweet Valley University (Homr For Christmas). Remember she was at their high school reunion. I just wonder how Francine pascal is going to explain that. It wouldn't be the first time we see a character back form the dead (hint: Margo). But overall I believe this is the best crying book yet. I can't wait for SVH Senior.
5,THIS ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!111,"this is an awesome book. most of the Sweet Valley books are a little unrelistic, but this could happen antime to real people. I started reading it at11:00 and Icouldn""t put it down I stayed up till 3 on a school night.i think its great how everything works out but I criedwhen Alyssa, a little girl that Jessica tries to save, dies. and its reallysad when Olivia dies too."
4,Eclectic Combination,I was gladly surprised by the unusual style of this Spanish singer. I do not believe there is anybody else cultivating a style that is both a mixture of Flamenco and Jazz. The more one listens to this CD the more one likes it. Chano Dominguez Trio is magnificent as the accompanying jazz band. Fortunately my CD did not have any glue (as other reviewer's) and came with a wonderful booklet with nice pictures and commentaries. The sound quality of this recording is also excellent. I would definitely buy another CD from Martirio.
1,"Bravo ! Martirio and Chano Dominguez Trio, but....","Interesting and excellent combination of acoustic Jazz with Cante Hondo. Martirio is fantastic! , but... I bought 4 CD's in total, 2 online and 2 in Madrid and three of them have manufactural problems (glue on the surface), making it impossible to hear it without annoying jumps."
3,"Good, interresting, and quite a voice","That cd was pretty good, on a latin-jazz point of view; it's soft and easy listening, Martirio has a good voice and her musicians are excellent. This CD will make your finger snap."
1,Mine was glued also,"I bought this CD in Madrid in a big CD store, and it had glue or something like it on the surface. I still have not been able to hear it. And I do not intend to buy a new one, after reading last review it sounds pretty likely that I would get another faulty CD..... very disappointed Martirio ..... ""It's almost a Martirio to get a faultless CD from you"""
1,Avoid CI Host and their products,"Clumsy interface, hard to use and understand product. Complete waste of money.Furthermore, I bothered to do some research on CI Host. They have avalanche of press releases. For every little thing they issue a PR. They have more PR than Microsoft and Intel combined. They are a new breed of spammers. Their PR agency promotes pyramids (multi level marketing) at their front page. The President of CI Host is bragging how he has had misleading his customers on purpose about the number of employees.I would stay away from CI Host."
5,Contents,"Rug Weavers Source Bookby linda ligonintroduction by martha stanley""Eight different craftspeople, all masterful weavers, teachers and writers, simply tell in considerable detail how they go from doing what they do.... The keystone of each chapter is a rug designed especially to illustrate the discussion with specific details.

2,Halloween Costume Review,"I was not happy with this Lilly Munster costume. The ribbon that was supposed to be on center was sewn on off to the right at the top and the whole length of the ribbon wasn't even sewn to the dress. It looked stupid, so I took it to a seamstress to fix it. Needless to say, the costume then cost more than I wanted to pay for it."
5,Great French-Canadian Singer!!,"I first heard this man sing, about four years ago, on a world music award program. It took me two years to find who it was, and sang the song ""Seul"". And I am so glad that I kept looking!Garou has a truely unique voice; very powerful, manly and a little rough. Even if you don't know French you will enjoy the feeling he puts into singing, and once you know the lyrics it will be that much better.If you really want a treat watch his live concerts, either the last tour on DVD, ""Garou live a Bercy"". Or his just finished tour on ""Routes"".I love all his work and highly recommend all three albums!"
1,Just another pop singer...,...as if there weren't enough already... I would recommend it to a 13-year-old girl though - something to cry over after a quarrel with a boyfriend...A message to all the others: don't waste your money. It isn't worth it. Really.
3,good as Notre Dame de Paris,"When I was in Paris, ""Seul"" got a great hit. I started listening to him, after I had watched ""Notre Dame de Paris."" At first I did not like his voice because I prefered the voice much clearer, I mean more classic style. However the more I listened to his voice, I started liking. The pop is pop --- so of couse the more you listen to this, the more you will get tired of it. However this CD has nice lyrics, so you need to spend more time to get tired of it!"
1,Cheeze and a Hot Dog ?,"This CD is soo cheezy that you cannot get pass the production. If you are searching for a good francophone product. I suggest CDs from CELINE DION ""DEUX"" or anything by BRUNO PELLETIER or SYLVAIN COSETTE. This CD has the SONY stamp all over it and sounds like it should be used as audition material for STAR SEARCH. Very cheezy !"
4,Soul and Blues en francais,"I just fell in love ith this guy's voice when I was listening to Notre Dame (de Paris) so, I just bought the album on the strength of that and the fact that Luc Plamondon was also involved here. The vocals are strong with a good blend of rock/blues leaning towards the raunchy at times (Criminel). The duet with Celine Dion is just beautiful but my favourites would have to be Seul and jusqu'au me perdre (Brian Adams input) - Canada lives! The rhythms are great, the lyrics are just beautiful - this is Joe Cocker en francais"
4,A Romance in Pacific Island,This is a delightlful book. The development of love between a man and a woman who had friendly platonic relationship is very well written. A man who has a mysterious job mission and frequently out of country for weeks at a time and a science fiction writer with a nightmarish past begin a slow friendship in a tiny coastal town in California.A trip to an island in Pacific Ocean unravels the hidden past and a new threat to their very survival. The story is intriguing and the suspense in the underwater cave is very real to readers.Jane Anne Krentz has done a wonderful job of writing a modern love story between the two people whose courage and love for each other overcame their pasts and enabled them to build a new life for themselves.
2,Couldn't get through it!,"I love Jayne Ann Krentz and her pseudonyms-Amanda Quick and Jayne Castle. She is usually a superb author, but I really don't know what came over her when she was writing this book. It was so boring that I couldn't get through it. I suggest you read one of her other books."
3,Entertaining,"I liked the story, but I thought the writing was a little less mature than Jayhne Ann Krentz's best novels."
3,Coral Kiss,The interaction between the characters was established by the middle of the book no need to beat a dead horse.
4,Romance and mystery are always a good mix.,I enjoyed the cat and mouse relationship and the full blown relationship that developed between these two people. The mystery was good but caving scares me.
4,Not what I usually expect,"The characters were acceptable, not the usual wonderful development I expect from this author. I suspect it's an older book, being released now because of demand. I enjoyed the secondary characters, they were somewhat believable and nicely developed."
3,A Wimpy Heroine,"It was an okay read--but I struggled to finish it. I like my protagonist to have a little intelligence and willpower. For most of the story Amy defers to Jed's decisions, even though they were ""just friends."" She acts like a doormat until almost the very end of the story. I was disappointed--not Jayne Ann Krentz's usual caliber."
3,Good Book,"I did get something out of this book, but not all that I thought I would. I'm not sure what direction I should go in to find out what type of information I want."
1,Great collector's toy!,"I bought this for my son for his 5th birthday, because he loves Power Rangers so much right now. It is a rather stupid toy, the power ranger is molded onto the dragon so it can't be removed, the colors it shows on the description page, is not the colors you get. It looked as if someone got lazy and didn't want to finish painting it, the wings are solid red, not colored with the blue paint like it shows. Really is nothing but a collector's item to display."
1,Gotta agree. Good Movie. Horrible DVD,I very much enjoy the movie but Disney cares nothing about the viewers. Fullscreen only and not DVD quality.Hope someone from Disney who cares is listening.
3,Not as much fun as Flubber,"We've been watching a lot of these old Disney live-action movies for family movie night, and we LOVED ""Flubber"" and ""Son of Flubber,"" but this one was a bit too advanced for my 8YO son, and a bit too dull for the adults. Still, it was fun to see Kurt Russell at an early age."
5,The Beach Book for 2005!!!!!,"""No such thing as a secret"" is a book that captivates you right from the very first page. Without giving the story away, all I will tell you is that it's funny, charming, entertaining and a knock-your socks-off-winner! What more could you ask for? KUDOS to Shelly Fredman!!!!"
3,My son loves it,"My son loves this toy. It is large in size it talks and it moves via remote control. But soon as he took him out of the box he broke him off of the glider because he was unaware it was not suppoose to come off and he dropped him and his arm fell off ( easy to get back on).Over all he loves him the satisfaction would be greater if you get the spider man with him, they talk to each other."
2,"Two boys' review: Fun for a day, quickly gathers dust","We bought this along with the Spider-Man Interactive 14"" and watched as our two young boys pushed the remote controls and watched as the figures traded quips and made fighting movements.And we watched it again.And again.By the fourth round, even our kids were tired of the toys, because you can't ""do"" anything else with them. They are bulky and require the plastic stands to stand upright (there are little pegs that snap into the characters' feet).Luckily, I was able to use rechargable AAA batteries. A couple days later, we slipped the batteries out of the toys and put them to use elsewhere in the house. Our kids never noticed.If you are looking for some kid-friendly, Spider-Man action figures, check out the Hasbro line from the new WB cartoon series, ""The Spectacular Spider-Man.""If you are looking for a talking lamp, minus the light, buy this."
2,Ms. 90's Blues,"I did not enjoy this story at all. There were too many characters. When starting a new chapter, I found myself saying, ""Who is this person?"" and then reading further to remember their significance to the story. The story didn't grab or hold my attention. It was a real struggle trying to get through this one. You should read Babylon Sisters before you read this one, though, so you'll understand the references to Mandeville Maids, et al."
2,Slow Read,"This was a very slow read. Most members that started reading it found that it was hard to get ""hooked"" from the beginning. The storyline seemed to slowly pick up towards the end of the book. It could possibly help if ""Babylon Sisters"" is read first. This is a book to check out from your local library, not for purchase."
4,Great Weekend Read!!!,"I have read all of Pearl Cleage's books and enjoyed this book as well. Became confused a couple of times as to which character I was reading and quite a few ""choice words"" but all in all a great read. I always look for a lesson to carry from each book and this point rang true for me...the Precious Hargrove blackmail. I really thought Precious was going to go along with the blackmail but she shocked me! Prior to reading this book I would have probably gone along with the blackmail to save my son's family and career, (as so many women do) but Pearl offered insight and something I honestly never thought of, standing by my son opposed to stepping in. His battle was not Precious's battle, he made his bed all by himself not Precious. Thank you Pearl!Many blessings on your next novel..."
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this novel. It introduces several characters and plots, but never really develops any of them. It was like traveling down a winding road and then the road just ends with no signs or warnings."
2,What a disappointment!!!!,"This book was not one of her better books. This story just seemed to drag, I finally gave up on it after 212 pages and I really hated to put it down since I had tried to read most of it but I juat could not get into it. It took me a week just to read that and I can usually read a good book within a day or two depending on how good the book was. This book is not worth the time or money."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I've read other books by the author and truly enjoyed them. Not this one. Cleage revisits characters from, ""Some Things I Thought I'd Never Do"". The book starts out promising, then introduces to many characters. This could have been two good books instead of one mediocre book."
1,"""The Way"" Bible","I purchased this item as a present for a church friend in Canada who had lost her original copy; the vendor was ""bookworm_babiak"" in Wisconsin. I was very impressed and satisfied by the service provided by both the seller and Amazon - I was kept informed almost daily about it's tracking location, but the most impressive thing was that the initial promised delivery was 8 weeks (not a prob, I thought; after all, it has to clear customs, etc). But the item arrived in less than 3 weeks and in excellent condition with the protective packaging totally intact! The whole procedure was a very stress-free event for me. The vendor was very courteous and efficient, as was Amazon."
1,Review,"I didn't hate this, I was really disappointed that I couldn't play this on my DVD player as it said it was the wrong region. Beware that you may not be able to play all DVDs on players outside of the States."
3,Losing Spark,I am not going to bother buying season 3 of Glee. Season 1 and 2 were wonderful but I feel like the writers have lost their spark. They have lost their motivation to make a great show. There were so many plot holes I couldnt keep up and there were stories that started then abruptly ended before its time. Its makes me sad to see this happen because Glee is a show that could be successful past the fourth season but I dont see it happening.
5,Christmas gift,"I purchased for my little sister for Christmas & she was thrilled to see it on Christmas Day. What made me happiest, was that I ordered it from my home in NY then drove all the way down to NC to spend Christmas at home & it arrived just in time for me to wrap it and put it under the tree. I was nervous prior to about it being late, but it was perfect! I LOVE AMAZON!!"
4,Plays well,This arrived in good condition and played well. Glee is entertaining but has many eye-rolling moments. I love Sue... she is my favorite!
5,A riveting season!,"This season keeps giving great twists, laughs, the music is better, and it build towards an even more exciting 4th season. My only complaint is that that Terri who is one of the most interesting characters didn't make an appearance and neither did Gwyneth Paltrow. I would like to see a lot of the storylines get tied up in a more conclusive manner."
3,Too expensive to buy!,$60. Blu-ray version! I have the two first seasons and will wait until next year when it's on sale at Target or Best Buy. The third season was the weekest to me with an awful ending. Unless big changes are made the show will flop out in it's 4th season. I think the honeymoon is over for many of it's fans. I don't want this show to end. There will never be another like it.
5,Granddaughter's request,My granddaughter attends a private school in Florida. She loves Glee but doesn't have the time to watch it on regular TV. She watches the DVDs on her computer when she has down time.
3,glee 3,Gavr sd gift I completely enjoyed this show and hope it continuesI.m very pleasd with this purchase thank you
4,Graduation,"If you were a fan of the first two seasons of Glee you certainly don't want to miss Season Three.Once again, our favorite band of vocal and dance misfits, entertains brilliantly with trips to Sectionals, Regionals, and Nationals before senior graduation. The vocal and dance routines are everything you have come to expect from this terrific cast, along with very entertaining story lines that combine serious topics blended with humor.While I enjoyed Season Three only slightly less than the incomparable Seasons One and Two, Season Three is a must for Gleeks everywhere...especially fans of Blaine, Quinn, Rachel, Finn, Santana and Brittany. This was money well-spent!"
5,Glee Season 3,"This was a very reasonable price for a brand new Blu-ray of an an entire season of a tv show. The product arrived before the estimated date. I was pleased with the picture quality. It was clear that I was recieving the entire third season as evidenced by the product description. I liked having four discs instead of 6 and a more compact case. It would have been nice to know how many episodes were in the season. I have thouroughly enjoyed the show since season one, and this season was no exception."
5,Great gift for my sister!,I got this for my sister for a cmas present and she loved it. She watched it with her freinds that also like the show too. Overall it was a great gift to give.
5,Glee,love this show. I am a huge fan. Now my collection is complete. If your a fan. this is a must get.
5,love glee.. what can i say,"maybe the best season yet!! I thought i would never be able to move on from this cast with the newest season, but i still love them"
1,Gleason 3 Failed,"I love glee! I joined in Season 2 and bought the first two season DVDs immediately and loved every second. There were only a handful of episodes I did not enjoy. Season Three was a complete failure. Me and fellow glee fan (my vocal coach) really hated it. He quit watching during season 3. I stuck with it even though it trainrecked. In this case, there was only a small handful of episodes that were decent. It was slow, less music, had a terrible plot, bad song selections, was trashy really, and overall almost unbearable. I did not buy this DVD for the first time. It isn't even worth 30 dollars in my opinion and that means a lot as such an earnest glee fan. I have bought all of the albums and many more singles of each season. Start season 4, I will not be buying the songs or DVDs, only watching out of memory of a past great show."
5,Glee...always a pleasure.,"Glee is always good entertainment. The music is always excellent. Great just to sit back, relax and enjoy the show."
5,Glee Rocks,I love this series and the third season is just a continuance of their brilliant talent. I'm not so keen on the plot or writing but I do love this talent they bring to this show. The singing and song selection is perfect and full of emotion. If you have hesitated thinking this is just for kids you are making a big mistake. Don't be a loser. Watch this series.
5,must have,season three of glee is probably my favorite. everything from the previous two seasons has built up to what happens in this season and it's an emotional roller coaster ride worth every second. watching it a second time is proving even moreso and i would definitely reccomend that every glee fan invest in the dvds!special features are great and fulfilling to the glee experience and packaging is great and compact for easy storage. it only takes up as much space as the case of a movie dvd which i found really impressive.
4,"Good quality, but wanted more extras!","I was very disappointed in the ""delated scenes"" included on the DvD, because many of the things promised to fans were not included, and one of the scenes on it had already been posted. That being said, the DVD is great, and it's nice to have it all in one place!"
2,A little too low budget,"I love low budget horror films but this collection managed to go below low budget to ""how much loose change do we have"". The films resemble not so much college project films as they do high school films. Stay away. Stay far away."
1,safe harbor,print was also too small couldn't get interested in something too smallI didn;t know publishers wrote in such small print
3,DOOM!!!!,"here is another release i cant believe someone hasnt reviewed yet,so here are my thoughts on it...file Count Raven along with bands like Black Sabbath,Trouble,Saint Vitus,etc. straight-up slow to mid-tempo doom metal.i'd probably give it another star (or half of one)if it werent for the vocals - this guy has the Ozzy thing down!it's one thing to proudly wear your influences on the sleeve,and another to blatantly rip-off another artist"
4,"Great instructional techniques, mediocre dvd","I own a few of the Funakoshi videos and wholeheartedly agree that the kata demonstrations are practically awe-inspiring. I really like the way the kata is first demonstrated slowly, then at normal speed, then slowed down again. If you want to learn the ""traditional"" shotokan kata, these videos are the source.With that being said, I would not encourage purchase of the DVD over the Tape version. The DVD is simply a ""tape to DVD"" copy, in which there are no chapters, menus, or anything else. It's simply a straight copy. What this means is that if you are using the dvd to learn a specific kata--which you likely will be, it's extremely difficult to save a certain spot on the video for repeating, practice later, etc.Other than that the video quality is fairly good--in fact excellent as compared to many other MA videos. My only gripe is with the lack of any menuing system on the DVD version. Next set will definitely be the tapes."
3,"Too Slim, Needs coverage of 1985+ cars",The prior issues had more information on a longer span of year models. Was once the best guide. Now it is not maintained well.
2,OldCars,After buying item was told would be 3 months before 1st issue. I won't need it then. Would never have bought it if I knew I had to wait 3 months
3,JUST AS DESCRIBED!,"THESE WERE JUST AS DESCRIBED. VERY COMFY. A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN WHAT I HAD HOPED FOR, BUT I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THEM!!"
4,cute capris,"I got the khaki version of these capris and they are very cute and true to the picture. They are a nice, medium length - not too short and not too long (I'm 5'8""). The belt is made up of several strings of mixed colors (black, white and a coral color) that you tie to tighten. They are definitely a great deal at $14!I'm not sure about a previous review that said they run big, as I had the opposite experience. I typically wear anywhere from a 0-4 (or x-small) in pants, so I ordered the 3-4 instead of the 1-2 to be safe. Well, the 3-4s are a little snug, so I would say these run small."
1,Buy weight watchers take out tonight instead,This cookbook has to few pictures and requires too many ingrediants. The only thing its useful for is the sweets and deserts sections. Save your money and buy weight watchers take out tonight instead. This cookbook has pictures of virtually every recipe. You can show your family the cookbooks and they are sure to pick several things that look good they won't even know its healthy (or care). Oh and the weight watchers take out book gives helpful tips after each recipe such as what you can make ahead and what set to freeze the dish for future use.
4,Best of Weight Watchers Magazine: Over 145 Tasty Favorites,The recipes look great! Can't weight to try them!
2,A History of the Castle,"This book provides an additional useful perspective on the history of Pontefract Castle, but because of its date of publication, the manner in which it was written and published, and the way in which it has been transformed into an e book, in places it is not as lucid as it could be. A useful addition would have been a map of Pontefract, showing its hills and the approximate street pattern of the time. This would widen readers' appreciation of the interaction between the castle and the town."
1,Wrong description,"Wrong description of this product. It said this is GAP compliant handset in the title, but when I received the product there is no such feature specification described on the box. This is not GAP compliant handset. It only works with Philips base station not other vendor's base station. Vendor should correct the product description."
3,sabre monger,"I needed this model because it is of the 1st Sabre built.(real). This model is extremely rare as all other kits available are of updated models, Sabre F's mostly which was the best model made (real). This particular model has an different windscreen which I can use for other models I have, so likely it will be cannibalized. For that I am happy, and this is the place to find it. Amazon, I went searching and you had it."
3,Hold on!,"Wait, and think about why you're buying this album/compilation. I bought it, bcuz I wanted the one Dannii Minogue track, which was unavailable elsewhere (for a decent price). As for other tracks, ""3. ...Baby One More Time [Definity Mix]"" is a cover, not a remix!!! Another important point is that it is a continuous compilation, meaning each song fades into the next. So if you rip one song, you're gonna hear other music at the beginning and end. I'd recommend this: save your money, and download limewire."
3,Does NOT work with multiple displays!,"I bought this product without doing a lot of research on it first, so I thought I'd write about this so other people won't make the same mistake. If you are a multiple monitor user (dual, triple etc) DON'T BUY THIS VERSION. You have to get the Spyder3 Pro version (which of course costs almost twice as much). Thankfully amazon's return system is pretty painless, so I'll be dropping it in the mail tomorrow. There really needs to be a better explanation of this in the product description to cut down on confusion. Other than that, the software calibrated ONE of my monitors perfectly, so if you only have one monitor, it's easy to use and pretty fast. It gets 3 stars for not supporting multiple displays though."
4,"For the price, it works great.","Does what it is advertised to do, and does it pretty quickly and easily on both Windows and Mac clients. (I used it on my XP desktop and MacBook Pro Laptop)Biggest drawback is that you can't specify the white point. This is only available in $$$ version. But it certainly improved my monitor output and now the output from my monitor and my prints (printed at Costco using a profile for the local costco downloaded from drycreekphoto.com)are much closer than they have ever been. I wouldn't say it is exact, but much better."
1,Not at all satisfied with this product,"Before using ColorVision Spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free Adobe Gamma program installed as part of Adobe Photoshop. My monitor looked great and the photos I printed looked great too. The colors were spot on. After using Spyder2 Express my monitor looks worse. My monitor appears dim, the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull. If I had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor I wouldn't have wasted my time. My hope was that it would make my monitor look better, not worse. I am not at all satisfied with this product wouldn't recommend buying it. Instead try Adobe Gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online."
5,Photo Color Correction,"Thus far the Spyder2 has been on the money. When I compare printed vs. viewed pictures, they are remarkably similar in tone and exposure."
2,"Buggy. When it works it's great, IF you can get it to work.","Works great, but MANY people have had a hard time getting the computer to recognize the device. Software will often say ""Please plug in your sensor"", when the device is already plugged in!IF you get it to work you will be VERY happy with the results-- just be prepared for an endless series of downloading drivers, re-installing, re-booting, etc, etc."
1,Disappointed,My laptop is connected to a new Samsung monitor. This product did not work for me even though I disconnected the monitor knowing that I may have problem with dual monitors. The screen is the same before and after carlibration. Emailed to customer service and still did not work. Wasted my money.
1,Horrible Product - tried both express and pro,"I am horribly disappointed in the Spyder products. I started with the pro version, which ruined my dual screen calibration. Then I tried this version thinking it might have been a dud. This is worse. Doesn't do dual monitors and made the image yellow and dry. Terrible product. Returning it today. I will never buy a colorvision product again. I gave them a chance on two different products across many 5 different displays. ALL...yes, all....failed with worse color than they started with. Beware of this crappy product. I wish there was something better....but Eye One is pricey and I heard mixed reviews on the Huey. What else is there?"
1,Colors were much worst after calibration,I just received Spyder2express and did the calibration on a MacBookPro 17in. I was very disappointed. The result were images that were horrible. I switch back to the defaults. Not much more to say. I was very disappointed. I had a similar problem with Huey Pro... maybe something is wrong with my Mac.
1,"Bad Product, Customer Service Worse!","I had some difficulty with the product loading the default profile, then the product asked later for a re-input of the serial number, which I no longer had. No big deal, contact customer service, right?Contacted customer service via email once, got no response. Sent a second email, and got a response asking a follow up question, since then nothing, no response, nada. All follow ups ignored.Perhaps this product will work for you, but for me, it ultimately went into the trash because of Colorvision's refusal to respond. Don't support this product, they won't support you!"
2,Spyder Express,"I have used this product just one time and I am not sure it was worth the effort. I screwed up my Adobe reader, my screen profiles and God only knows what else I have done.The instructions are LOUSY and I don't suggest you buy it unless you know how to mess with closing and modifying programs."
2,Not as easy as it sounds,"They say this is easy to use. Yea, maybe if you are part of the geek squad from Best Buy, or you know alot about computers. I have had this for a year now and it is still not installed. The directions tell you what to do but they assume you now all the tech on computers. It's like telling someone that does not take photos to use a small aperature for depth of field. I understand that but would not expect everyone to. I even had a friend who fixes computers for a living try. He couldn't get through all the ""easy installation"" instructions.I know this product is great for the calibration. But I can not see for myself because I can't get it installed."
1,not easily Mac OS X compatible; not compatible with monitors using LEDs for their backlight,"The software requires a PPC emulation that is no available in any recent Mac OS or any recent Mac hardware. ColorVision should make this more clear. If you hunt around, you'll see they suggest their Spyder 3 software, which is helpful -- though be warned: almost all monitors these days use LEDs for their light source, and the Spyder 2 came out before that was the case, and it cannot read them."
4,Definite improvement on my LCD,This product was very easy to use and made a definite difference on my LCD screen. You can't beat the results for the price! Definitely recommend this to anyone who takes digital photos.
4,Does what it's meant to do!,The Spyder 2 Express was bought after some serious printing disasters. I now have the confidence that my images will actually print as they look on the screen!
3,Doesn't work with dual monitors,"As other reviewers have noted, this software will not work if you use a dual monitor set-up. I thought I could get around this by turning off my dual monitors, and calibrating just one monitor to use for photo processing. That doesn't work, though. Something in the calibration software is just incompatible with the dual monitor software."
4,Easy and Fast,"I use my laptop 90% of the time and wanted my images to look closer to what I expected when printed. This will not take care of all your color management issues, it is only one part but it does the job very nicely.The directions were very easy to follow it took about 10 minutes total. If you use Vista you have to download a driver from Colorvision's site so the software will download, go to the site before you start to install and it will save you time."
5,Great product.,A very easy and inexpensive device to calibrate your display. I never expected such a great improvement in my iMac monitor after calibrating it with the Spyder2 from Color Vision. I recommend it highly.
3,Not for everyone - especially if you are color technical,"Lacks Flexability- It adjusts screen to Kelvin 6500 (yellow). For most, especially if you are into photo editing, that is far too warm. I personally like about 5500. The result is that it makes the screen look warmer than what the photos are, or when printed. I have contacted ColorVision, and there is no flexability on this unit. You have to move up to a more expensive package to have the flexability."
2,"If you're on an Intel Mac, don't bother","The colorimeter itself seems fine, but the Mac OS X software for this unit is buggy and not a universal binary (which, if they were going to update it for Intel Macs, I would think they would have by now). Twice I had it crash at the end of a 10-minute calibration, before I was able to save the profile. The app would subsequently hang on opening, so that I had to completely uninstall it to get it to launch again. I returned it and will spend the bigger bucks on a Gretag-MacBeth or Xrite unit."
4,Flimsy,The Spyder works technically very well but attaching it to my LCD proves troublesome.The cord is so rigit that I have to either hold the Spyder to my screen or use tape so it does not wiggle away.Apart from that it does a fine calibration job.
5,for a better monitor,i am an amateur photographer. I have been struggling the color mismatch between my computer screen and print out. spyder pro is too pricey for me. This is right product for me. It took about several minutes to complete the process. Now I am sure what I see is what I will get.
5,Great value for your money,"The kit is REALLY simple to use and it made a dramatic improvement of color matching in our office.Simple, high quality and cheap.Highly recommended!"
4,Easy to use,"I bought the Spyder 2 suite and the monitor calibration worked very well. The printer calibration, not so good. The printer calibration is strictly a judgement call. You pring a picture from the program and they match it to the monitor picture. I could have done that without paying extra for a program that is pretty lame. I thougtht the printer program would print something and then the hardware would scan it and set the printer program, unfortunatley it doesn't work that way. As I said at the stare the monitor calibration worked very well and was easy to use.Earl Stuckey"
4,Great System,"I read about this in Scott Kelby's Photoshop CS2 Book. I went with this model since I'm not a professional photographer. Much lower price than their highest end model. I had a little trouble installing the software, my fault didn't follow every step exactly, but finally figured it out and everything went smoothly.I highly recommend this for calibration. I'm an amatuer photographer and I've experienced a lot of frustration with my prints not matching the onscreen photo. If you print your own pictures get this and Scott Kelby's Photoshop Book! Your frustrations will come to an end."
5,Did the job I needed.,"I can't vouch for this thing the way a professional photographer/graphic designer might, but it did what I needed. I have aSamsung SyncMaster 226BW 22"" LCD Monitor(did not get it at Amazon, BTW), and 3 different manufacturers make the panels that are sold under that name (thanks a lot, Samsung). Mine was way too blue, and I couldn't fix it very well with the monitor settings. But after I used the Spider2 Express it was like a blue plastic filter was just detached from the screen. Its colors' now match monitors I know are fairly accurate, so I am pretty happy."
3,Doesnt work (well) on vista/Dual monitor,1) download the latest version of teh software from the website (esp if you have vista)2) if you a dual monitor display- you are SOL. support told me to get the Pro version for a few hundrew more dollars.3) the integration with vista color is horrible. stick to XP or MAC.
3,Quick and easy,I bought this product just to be sure all my monitors at home (and work) are in sync. Using Photoshop to modify pictures require to have all PC's showing similar color and details. The calibration process takes just a few minutes and is very simple. The only problem I had was trying to avoid the sensor from sliding on my LCD monitors. I had to attach a clip to the cable to prevent this.I am satisfied with the results. My pictures now look the same on all monitors.
4,Good except for....,"The product is easy to use and worked well for me, except I had to send it back because it cannot handle a dual monitor setup with 2 profiles. I confirmed this with the vendor. So, go for it, but only if you have one monitor."
5,Works great,easy to use. just install the software and follow the instructions. Keeps my monitor calibrated and reminds me when it is time to recalibrate.
4,Works as advertised,"I am an oil painter and I like to archive photos of my work. I have long been frustrated by the color alterations that I see on my various monitors and when printing. The ColorVision Spyder2 should at least give me a more trustworthy on-screen representation. I do see the difference after calibration, but have yet to do exhaustive tests of my own to see how the color realism compares with the original paintings. The product was very easy to use and appears to work as advertised."
2,Inconsitant Results,This calibration unit was evaluated on both a CRT and LCD monitor. The calibration for the CRT was excellent. The calibration on the LCD monitor left much to be desired and the results were not constant over several trials.
5,Great product!!!,The Spyder express 2 is a great tool for anyone...especially a photographer. It was simple and easy to use...and it hardly took anytime to calibrate my monitor.I am totally satisfied with it and will suggest it to others I know.
4,ColorVision Spyder2 Express Win/Mac,Easy to use and performed as expected. I wished it could adjust the color in my LCD flat panel TV.
3,For Mac Users,"The 2.2 gamma setting seems to be unchangeable! so if you would like to set your gamma on your mac default number, you may not be able to do so. Otherwise the devise works well but for better calibration control you will probably need more professional device."
3,Teaching tool - El Cid,I teach middle schoolers medieval history and like to show this film as a way of explaining some feudal issues and ideas about the Reconquista. Its got pretty tame combat sequences. Only problem is that it is long so you will want to use the scene selections.
3,A great picture from the end of Hollywood's golden age.,"This film is one of the last of the great hollywood epic films in the style of Samuel Goldwen. Heston is typically magnificent as El Cid and Sophia Loren as his love interest and then estranged wife Jimena. Strangely, I have never seen this film of television, unlike Ben Hur, Spartacus, and the rest of the titles that I think of in the same genera as El Cid. I was disappointed that the film used for the video I received was in such poor condition. It is ""pan a little and scan less"" and the images are dark and gloomy. The story is still a great adventure and still has a bittersweet ending. I hope that AMC, AFI, or some other film restorer gets around to the master and that they release it to home viewing."
4,Charlton Heston at his best.,Fantastic epic and a must for all cinema lovers. I agree with the viewer from the united states 2 jan 2000 . The film badly needs to be restored to its original widesreen format. Pan and scan does it no credit at all. When it is restored to its original cinemascope glory then it will be second to none.
5,Powerful yet human epic,"Generally ignored by critics and viewers, El Cid is an undiscovered treasure on the video shelf. It contains many of the same elements that made Braveheart a runaway success: Exciting battle scenes, real emotion, and the overwhelming necessity of personal sacrifice for a greater cause. A needed tale for our self-centered times."
1,Wait,"The real dvd release of El Cid is finally happening on 1/28/08 in a special edition and collector's edition. It will be remastered with lots of great extras. Don't buy the bad copies or the Asian bootlegs, wait for the real thing."
5,A wonderful epic adventure!!,"Director Anthony Mann has a big hit on his hands with ""El Cid"". It stars Charlton Heston as Rodrigo Diaz of Bivar, known in history as ""El Cid"". A man who has the courage of a thousand men and a man who has the vision to be just. This movie features some of the most stunning battle scenes on film. Sophia Loren turns in an excellent performance as Rodrigo's wife Chimene. The thing I believe steals the film is a spectacular score by Miklos Rosza. (which deservedly got an Oscar nomination) This is a film to see and see again. A wonderful movie!!"
1,El Zed,"Caveat emptor!This review is specific to the twin-VHS set of EL CID (Italy/USA-1961) manufactured by Best Film & Video Corp. It is a total dog!Recorded in ELP mode (the worst for quality) and with only a linear audio track (no HiFi), there's just a smidgen of tape in each cassette. In the EP mode, two EL CIDs could've fit on a single tape, so this is also a space-waster.Definitely thumbs down!Worst news of all: there isn't a good VHS version available of EL CID. Despite the numerous Ammy listings, all are from fly-by-night outfits like BF&VC;."
4,El Cid,Exellent ordering system and arrived earlier than expected. Will use again. Move was exellent. I had not seen it but heard a lot about it. Very worthwhile movie to watch.
4,amazing;,I enjoyed this movie one of the best movies sence moses also played by Charlton Heston to me.He is the greatest Actor of all time.
1,US Buyers Beware!,"This DVD will not play on our US Blu Ray machine. Nowhere in the product description was this stated. As a frequent and loyal Amazon customer, I am NOT happy and expect Amazon to rectify this situation. I expect better of them! Am giving one star because I have to. This transaction is worthy of 0 stars."
2,Region-A EL CID blu-ray with a big problemo,"As of now, this is the only blu-ray edition of EL CID that's region-A and English friendly, and I'm assuming it's a Brazilian release for the Portuguese-speaking market, but there's a big problem with it: the print used is not only devoid of the overture (which sometimes happens), but the main titles have also been excluded! The rest of the film is included in its entirety (with intermezzo and exit music), and seems to be scanned from the Rank print being used worldwide. The picture quality is not up to par with the region-B European editions, of which, the Anchor Bay UK edition is the best. The English track can be played without subtitles in 5.1 DTS-HD, so if you want to get right into the story by pressing play, this could be the copy for you. There's a Portuguese dub for laughs in mono, with a complete re-edit of Rozsa's score."
4,A review of the epic film- El Cid,"A lengthy, but outstanding epic about the wars during the middle ages between the Spaniards and the Moors. Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren deliver good performances. Good scenery and decent acting. A lot of action including jousts and sword fights. Many good supporting actors. A good plot. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys history and movies in the style of Braveheart and Gladiator."
4,El Cid DVD,"While not one of the great movies of all time and endowed with its share of problems, El Cid has always been one of my favorites. It inspired an interest in Spanish history and the music of Miklos Rozsa. Both have been rewarding, life-long pursuits. And this DVD restoration is excellent - clarity, color, sound, commentary, special features, all of it."
5,EL CID,Excellent remastering of a classic film. The extra addition to the DVD provide a keen indepth look on how the film was made. I recommend this purchase to anyone with a keen eye to epic films. This is a MUST in a collectors library.El Cid (Two-Disc Limited Collector's Edition)
4,One of the most representative samples of the great epic films of the sixties!,"After the great success of Ben Hur, the febrile imagination of screenwriters and filmmakers turned their absolute attention on epic themes. Anthony Mann would make two emblematic movies in this decade; this one and ""The fall of the Empire Roman"" with interesting results keeping in mind the arduous complexity of the narrative material.Charlton Heston once more, was required to star this highlight spectacle about the famous legend of the Cid. The saga is depicted with ravishing splendor, recreating admirable battle sequences. The presence of the alluring beauty of Sophie Loren was an additional hook to engage the great audiences, in her role of Gimena.Opulent and distinguished movie."
4,Great Movie,"This lovely classic at last available in a DVD with decent picture and sound, along with mind blowing extras. This limited collector's edition comes with 2 additional booklets and few art cards. Even though I purchased the Limited Edition, I feel like the goodies not worth the additional money I paid. Also the box will eat up more space in your DVD rack. So buying theEl Cid (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) (The Miriam Collection)will be a good deal. I highly recommend this along withThe Fall Of The Roman Empire (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) (The Miriam Collection)"
5,One Of The Best,"So far I've only seen the restored EL CID at the cinema, so can only comment on the film generally. This is certainly a great epic. Not as perfect or inspiring as Ben-Hur, or as brilliant and intellectually daring as Spartacus, it nevertheless impresses in every department, from the intelligent script to the incredibly convincing sets and costumes to Miklos Rozsa's stunning score. Far from the rather camp ""knights"" films of the fifties (PRINCE VALIANT, KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE etc), this is one film that takes itself utterly seriously, and is all the better for it, despite the complaints of those critics who can't, or don't want to, take any historical film seriously. Indeed I've read so many negative or luke-warm reviews of this film I sometimes wonder if there aren't 2 EL CID's! Well, each to his own, but for my money EL CID runs BEN-HUR and SPARTACUS, in that order, a close third. As I said, one of the very best of its kind."
3,The DARK Side,"A good film , but disc needs 'restoration' = contains many 'film artifacts'ie. splotches and some 'streaking' ie. mistracking of a video copy that was used to transfer film to disc. Also the PRINT IS VERYD A R K It badly needs 'remastering'; the audio is also 2-track stereo instead of its original 6-track Surround! A poor effort all around!!Edd Kerr c/o iegolden@shaw.ca"
3,El Cid,"The movie itself is one of the best of it's kind The stars are great, the locations accurate, and the story very good and inspiring. My main complaint is with the video itself. I had the priviledge of seeing this film in it's original format when it was first released, and am very disappointed that it has not been restored to it's original format. This kind of film can not be appreciated in the poor, pan and scan format in which it is presented. Until it is fully restored to the original format, it will continue to be only a three star film. The format in which it is offered is vastly inadequet. Please restore this film to it's rightful glory. It deserves better treatment than this. Thank you."
5,El Cid @ disk DeLuxe Edition DVD,I had been looking for this DVD for some time. Very pleased with thequality on the DVD. The actors (Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren hvae always been favorites and the performance in this movie was excellent.
2,Who is the real Charlton Heston?,"I have heard and read about people with more than one identity, but this guy drives me nutz!. The vhs I viewed was not good quality, but Sophia looked great! In retrospect, I would not recommend this movie."
1,poor product,Last 15 minutes at least missing. Poor message written by proprietor. worst product I have received on Amazon not good for record.
1,"Be warned, Bad Transfer","This has no information on whether it is the restored version or not. It looks suspiciously like the dire UK region 2 version, in which case it should be avoided like the plague."
2,El Cid,"Overall disappointed. The DVD gave me some trouble, but most of all while the soundtrack was good and loud, the volume had to be turned way up on the dialogue."
2,El Cid,The best movie of the spanish epic and a valious video for the knowledge of the medieval spanish history.
2,El Cid,"El Cid is poorly written, poorly acted, and the actors motivations seem to come from nowhere."
3,El Cid OK,"My wife and I lived in Spain for several months in the Spring of 2007 to attend the Loius Vuitton races prior to the America's Cup. El Cid is a well known film over there especially amoung the folks our age who remember the implied love making scenes between Charlton Heston and Gina. We traveled to Peniscola where the movie was filmed (it was not filmed in Valencia where the historical events were suposed to have happened) and toured the castle (built by the Templar Knights). Had to have the movie when we returned. It brought back great memories of both Spain and the first time we saw the movie many years ago. Roger H. Strube, MD"
1,Could not play it,I received the movie; and it would not play in my blu-ray player. A message appeared saying it would not play in this region. I had no idea what this meant. I only know the movie would not play. I returned it on 11/23/12; and as of today have heard nothing back. I'm now reluctant to purchase any more blu-ray movies from Amazon. I hope this matter will ultimately be resolved.
5,Father In Laws Favorite,Father in law always talked about this movie but we could never find it anywhere local. This was a great present that he watches often!
4,True Clasic,"El Cid is a great depiction of Medieval Spain! There is enough violence to satisfy most prurient interests. In addition, the beauty of Sofia Loren, the pageantry and chivalry of the royal court, and the intrigue of familial politics make for a dynamic presentation of the life and times of Spain's greatest hero.The plot follows the storyline of the ""Song of the Champion El Cid"" as it has come down through the centuries. There are a few factual discrepancies but they do not severely hinder the appreciation of the art of this epic."
5,WOW,I can't add anything new to what has already been said. I can only say I've waited ( along with everyone else ) these many years for the promise that this movie was coming to dvd to come true. It is finally going to happen in a edition that may well make that wait worthwhile. A epic that makes you care thanks to the amazing acting by all involved. HAPPY NEW YEAR INDEED.
5,One of the best ever - and Heston too - you can't lose,"A hero of justice in the feudal middle ages and a man of vision must suffer at the hands of his superiors (and more than once) and still defends their honor and country voluntarily. Heston once again displays a full range of emotions - Sophia Loren complements the stage with her radiant beauty and turbulent emotional conflict which comes to a final resolution. The bigger the screen the better, folks, but I could never stop wondering if there was about an hours worth of the movie that never made it to the screen... Still worth watching, and I have, several times. Heston and Loren fans - you can't miss with this."
3,"OK,but..............","I love the story, it is great, length of film is no problem, my problem is that Amazon advertises that there is ""closed caption"" on it, non at all, we have deaf in family, a major disapointment to them, I believe this is a bare bones copy from Japan, so if you are in need of ""C/C"", don't buy this one, I wish I hadn't."
1,It's a STINKER!,"If I was a Teacher (like the co-author) I'd give give this stinkin' piece of writing a 'C', an 'R', an 'A' and a 'P'. It reeks!"
1,WARNING!! DO NOT BUY!!,"This DVD is a collection of downloaded material that is free to view on YouTube and freely available from other sites. The person who has compiled this DVD simply threw all the material on a DVD, made a poor DVD cover and sealed it in plastic. This DVD is should not be allowed to be sold since some of the material is copyrighted. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! Stay away from this ripoff."
4,"Great product, but overcharged by 40-50%","An earlier review mentioned ""doing the math"" on this product. Buy it online from these guys and pay over 7$ for an 8 oz. box. Buy it at your local grocery store (Safeway, Wal-Mart, Publix, Winn-Dixie, Albertsons, Pathmark, etc.)and pay between $3 and $4 for the same product!!! No brainer here."
2,"Poor quality sound, cheap hardware","These speakers appear to have solid construction, and the Boston Acoustics brand garners fair reviews for the price, however my experience was very disappointing. I replaced the front factory Subaru paper-cone speakers with these. They were being powered by a couple-year-old Sony head unit with maybe 17 watts RMS. It may be that these require more power to produce adequate sound-quality, but I doubt it would make them shine. It has been a few months since I installed and demoed them in the car, but I remember them sounding worse than the factory speakers at any volume level I tried. Even my girlfriend knew something was very wrong and avoided listening to music in the car. The other problem I ran into was with the included hardware. The screws are made very cheaply. Even with the included bit and the clutch turned way down on the driver, I managed to strip the head of every screw. If I were you, I would save your money and choose a different brand."
1,This sucks,This toy stinks like my dodo Dont ever by this garbge only a fool wil by this so think twice
1,The Trumpet that sounds like a wailing cocatoo,DO NOT BUY THIS INSTRUMET! My son got it last week and wanted to play beautiful music not music that sounded like a wailing cocatoo! The instrument teacher told me to bring it back because when I looked inside it there were real live cocatoo turds. Thank you very much fist act for putting cocatoo turds in my son's trumpet.
1,PLEASE NO DO NT GET THIS!,dont get it. dont get it dont get it!!! this is all i have to say. ***thank you***
4,Flyin Home Lionel!!,"I have to tell you Lionel Hampton has yet to be matched in talent, and drive on the ""phones."" Funny Story, it was Tito Puente the late and legendary "" King of the Mambo"" was the one who showed Lionel (by carefull persuation) the light of the ""phones"" and shuned him away from the piano. Unfortunatly not much was known on this subject of the two meeting but I believe they meet in the service or right after Tito was discharged for WW II. I can tell you Lionel, to me, is best know for His BIG version of ""Flying Home"". A bigger, badder version of the small groups version he did with Benny Goodman, and teddy wilson. Lionels closest match would have to be Red Narrvo form the 1930's, but still Mr. Hampton 's drive and moves on the stage has yet to be matched."
2,"Great songs, painful vocals","The new singer's attempt to imitate Brett Scallion's masculine growl results in a thin, nasally rasp that feels like a dental drill in my ear. Oddly enough the dental drill effect is at its raspiest on the softest vocals. Just try listening to the ear-shredding verses of ""I Should Have Told You"" at high volume--you'll be reaching for the volume knob before your eardrums give out. When he belts it out at high volume, he forgets to mimic Scallion and the rasp largely disappears. Too bad about the vocals because the song writing is actually better than on any album since Sunburn. In future albums maybe they'll just let him sing with his real voice, but it's too late for this release."
4,Good but Depressing,This a good CD. I really like the sound of Fuel but a lot of the songs on here are very depressing. At least some more positive songs would have made it better.
1,Terrible,"This album reeks of generic radio rock. Fuel used to have a distinct sound, but this album sounds like all the other rock bands on the FM charts. Actually when the first song played I thought i accidentaly put in a Hinder album. Buy the song ""Again"" and leave the rest of the album alone, it's the only good song on here."
3,Great album BUT...,"I love this album so far. It's excellent. Great songs. Great lyrics, good hooks, great music. It sounds like Fuel. But my only complaint is even though Toryn sounds similar to Bret, I can't help but listen to these songs and imagine Bret singing them. Perhaps once I get past that I will like the album even more. I've heard Toryns stuff from Something to Burn and I loved it. It doesn't sound anything like Fuel, and in a way on this new Fuel album, it often feels like Toryn is intentionally TRYING to sound like Bret.All of that aside, we get an excellent album. Every song on it is good. If you can get by the past, you will dig it."
2,More of a side project than Fuel of old,"Ok,let's start off with Brett Scallions left and he was the glue into the music Carl Bell created.Enter Toryn Green,a good singer no bashing or anything but this album sucked thanks in large part to the lyrics.A few standout songs like Wasted time,Not this time,Gone had me going but others were to lamentable to hear and boring,like I should have told you,Mess,Again this album lacked what other fuel albums had,intensity.Carl Bell should consider moving on without Fuel and doing something on his own,you can't replace awesome with mediocrity."
4,This album is good,"A lot of Fuel fans won't be happy with the band having a new lead singer, which is understandable, but, if you give this album a listen you'll realize this isn't half bad at all, really the songs on this album are emotion driven, the ones I really like are leave the memories alone and wasted time... I really give this album a solid 4 because it really stands out to Fuel's level."
4,Welcome Back Boys,"Great to see Fuel back in action again.I thought it was all over with Brett leaving , but the boys are back with a very good album.This is a new chapter for the band and Toryn fits like a glove he sounds like brettand is a great addition.I hope they come to Australia because l would love to see them live , Fuel never received the attention they deserved down under."
2,It's alright.,"This is a ok CD, I thought it was going to be better than what it is. If you are going to try to fill Bretts shoes then you need to come with something better than what they came with. Nothing really stands out on it for me yet, but I find myself just going back to ""Wasted Time."" But I am giving it a chance. I just have to listen again and see if something changes...who knows!"
2,Got defected watch...,"I was really upset to know that the watch stopped after 2 months. I bought it as a present for Christmas, but when I was going to present it, I realized that it stopped. Thanks to Amazon team, they value customers and initiated refund of my money as soon as I would send the defected product."
5,cute watch,It looks more beautiful than the picture. It is so cute. I bought it at a very cheap price $64.5. Very happy with it.
4,Super Reader,"Perhaps the origin of the 'psychic detective' or ghostbuster genre,with the use of Doctor Heselius as a framing character for thesestories as being part of his history of cases. Carmilla is a fine, finetale, with a disturbing female monster. Le Fanu is well worthinvestigating for horror fans that have not done so in the past."
1,In A Glass Darkly,"WARNING! My Oxford World's Classics paperback copy had pages of Thoreau's ""Walden"" inserted after p.158 of the story ""The Room in the Dragon Volant."" Missing are approx. 50 pages of the LeFanu story, so it's not like it's a bonus. I'm letting Amazon know about it, but check your copy on receipt!! Very disappointing to not know what happens, kind of like watching a thriller on TV and then the power goes out, but the broadcast stays on so you miss the middle.I do rate LeFanu's stories 4-5 stars though. Really well-written page turners!"
4,Informative--great for students,"Well, I won't waste your time. The bottom line-- is this book is worth buying. Its got great insight on many of Gauguin's paintings, and even discusses his background and influences. A must for any art student, or art buff. Your money will not be wasted! For ten bucks, you'll be buying a book you'll use time and time again. Good luck, and happy book buying!"
3,Nose bridge is hard to change and easy to break,"I'd like these goggles a lot better if I could actually change the nose piece out. It came with three sizes, but I cannot figure out how to swap them out, there are no instructions with the goggles and other reviewers of Tyr Goggles with this ""feature"" have reported breaking the goggle before they even get to try the out. They are nice, but you better like them as they are because swapping out the nose piece is near to impossible without breaking the goggles. I can't wear 'em and can't return 'em. Go try these in a store before you end up in my situation."
5,Best pair of goggles I own,I have may different pairs of goggles for swimming but these are the best fitting pair I own. Rarely fog or leak. I would highly recommend them
2,Disappointed,"The ""magic story"" falls flat. Very flat. In fact, the best part of the book was the build-up to the ""magic story."" Once you get to it, it is brief and superficial. Get ""The Attractor Factor"" by Joe Vitale or even ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill. These inspire and deliver content; ""Magic Story"" does not."
2,Tght fit,I bought this because it said it is large. My knees aren't fat but this wrap is essentially impossible to get over my knee. I love the heat from my Thermalon neck wrap and thought this would be wonderful. Don't buy it unless you have skinny legs.
4,good product,"this product is much better than others, believe or not, I bought three brands with similar product but this one keeps warm longer and the quality of material is much better. happy with this product."
5,Wonderful Stories,"I have four year old triplets and we love reading this book and others by Maj Lindman. Good old-fashioned, wholesome childhood stories! Sheila Laut, Author of Raising Multiple Birth Children."
5,Very good product.,"I bought this iron to upgrade my weak 30watt model I had been using. I really like the high heat this iron produces for the tough jobs, like soldering cable ends. My old 30watter was not doing the job. Thankfully, this one works very well. I highly recommend it."
3,Hermey Necktie,"Good product used as a novelty birthday gift for someone who was nicknamed ""Hermey"" when he was younger. Got a good reaction from the gify recipient."
4,"sturdy, good size patties",Good construction for the price. Would give five stars but would prefer that the patties are six inch diameter because the meat shrinks to a meatball otherwise. Bought another one for a gift and they like it so far.
1,donaldo c.,"I find it hard to describe this album as anything but lousy! I agree with r seifert entirely. I am a longtime fan of Stan, but how a professional could release this junk is beyond comprehension. No sound balance,Huge gaps before track starts,at least one bad vocal and trombone gaffs.The good news--I thought the track selection was great!"
1,A waste of money,"This album is recorded LIVE and therefore lacks the proper mic placements, audio seperation and balance along with the search for overall playing perfection. You are smart not to provide listening portions to preview this CD. I wish I could return this CD for something else."
2,Wear gloves!!!,"I ordered these because of the great price. I installed the yellow cartridge with no problems. The next was photo magenta. When I removed the tab over the ink outlet, I got ink all over my hand. I may have been a little to fast, so on the next one I installed, I was VERY carefull. Long story short, my hand is now cyan. When I finish wearing the next 9 cartridges, I'll be going back to the canon cartridges (at a discount through Amazon.com, of course)."
5,Love the monkeys,I bought 2 of these shower curtains for our sons room. We took off the closet doors so no one would get the fingers caught. Our sons are 2 and 11 months. Put these up and no worries now. and it hides the closet and looks Great. Very Easy To Clean...
5,Excellent show. Track Listing,This live show has a lot to offer. Beautiful harmonies with a great sense of humor thrown in. These guys are very talented. No wonder they are regulars at Dollywood. Here's the track listing:1) Song of Praise 2) Precious Savior 3) On the Right Road 4) Portrait of Grace 5) I'm Depending On His Promise 6)When Jesus Comes 7) Grace One More Time 8) Instrumental 9) Jacob's Ladder 10) Midnight Oil 11) Be of Good Cheer 12) Basics of Life
4,Good,"This is a unique gift and toy. However, Beethoven did not stay on the stool, which was disappointing. Otherwise neat details and it made a nice gift for a Beethoven fan."
5,Impressive First Chapter,"These Proper box sets are a bargain--competently and intelligently produced. ""The Stan Kenton Story"" represents Kenton's band from 1942-1952, the period during which he established a distinctive sound, then found his visionary energies leading him to the experiments of the 44-piece Innovations Orchestra and the polytonal arrangements of Bob Graetinger.Additionally, Kenton fans undoubtedly will wish to acquire music representing the other two chapters in Stan's career--first, the all-star, swinging, neo-bop ensemble that Kenton formed in 1952, culminating in his ""Mellophonium Orchestra"" and the end of his association with Capitol records; second, the traveling orchestras that he recorded on his own label, Creative World, between 1964 and 1979. If you're limiting your purchases, try ""The Best of Stan Kenton"" on Capitol and ""Live at Redlands University"" on Creative World."
4,Stan Kenton remembered,"Excellent for those who enjoy the music of Stan Kenton. This collection clearly illustrates that 'the Kenton Sound' evolved over the years, with the help of a fantastic group of musicians!I remember talking with Stan Kenton at a college concert in the '50s. He said that he played 'music for the people', and he also enjoyed talking about his music as well. A unique and talented gentleman!!Thanks to this collection, the mellow sounds of Kenton will remain alive in my memory."
1,A REAL HOWLER,"What can you expect from a movie starring Mark Dascascos, Yancy Butler and Jeremy London? Not much...but this is worse than your lowest expectations.WOLVESBAYNE is a mindless mishmash of curses, vampires, werewolves, hokey action scenes, horrid effects, terrible editing and general nonsense.A real stinkeroo!"
4,What amazing healing powers!,"St. John's Wort has long been the remedy of choice in Europe not only for depression, but for a wide variety of health problems, from insomnia to anxiety disorders to PMS. It is considered to be a completely natural antidepressant that is safe, yet as effective as leading pharmaceuticals. This is a comprehensive guide that will show you how to use this powerful ancient herb safely and effectively. *Boost your immune system & fight colds and flu *Relieve insomnia, anxiety, and seasonal affective disorder *The truth about St. John's Wort and weight loss, with inspiring real-life stories *Treat PMS, menstrual & menopausal discomfort *A doctor's guide to achieving maximum health benefits, including optimum dosages for each specific health application *Exciting new discoveries for using St. John's Wort in the treatment of cancer, HIV, ADD. This herb is considered to be a gentle path to healing."
4,Funky and laid-back,"The sounds of People Under the Stairs are encapsulated in this CD single - the song ""San Francisco Knights"" was my favorite. Their style is fresh and new, different from all of the recent hip-hop groups. ""SF Knights"" is jazzy and relaxed, with creative lyrics and a real quality sound. I recommend this to someone who is looking for a sample of a quality hip-hop band, without having to fork over money for a whole CD up front."
4,Tale of the Rail,"Remember when train-treading heroes and villains were concerned with the plundering of berths and compartments and fat guys blocking the corridors? Recall when no-nonsense stalwarts like Charles McGraw and tough cookies like Marie Windsor could rule the silver screen with a steely glance? Whatever the memory or lack thereof, forget train terrorists who punch in perdition with cell phones and computers, and revel in a terrific tale of mistaken identities and intriguing plot twists!"
4,Twists and Turns,"I just viewed this film and was pleasantly surprised. I am not an avid fan of film noir, but after seeing this gem, I wish to delve into the genre further. The movie is akin to Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"", but exceeds it with grim tone and lighting. The characters are brassy and fun and make for engaging entertainment. The movie will keep you guessing until the very end and is highlighted by deft camerawork and tight angles. The confines of shooting aboard a train (or sets that resemble one) give a claustrophobic feel to the film. This uneasiness carries over to the viewer, making for an edge-of-your-seat enjoyment! Remade in 1990 with starrer Gene Hackman."
5,Bret Hart,Its awsome very recommended to all the Hart fans or to those who want to know about Wrestling History.
2,Very disappointing.,"I was always fond of Lite Brite when I was a kid and so I thought my kids would have just as much fun as I did. I decided to go with the cube/travel combo. The cube was slightly disappointing because (being vertical) the pegs frequently fall out. The travel Lite Brite is just poorly constructed. The unit turns on with the push of a button, but will not turn off. The batteries must be removed for the bulb to go off. This is the second travel Lite Brite I have had with the same problem. Junk!!! I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy."
1,Father of 4,"Why do these large corporations think we will continue to buy poorly made products that aren't even close to the originals for twice the price. This Lite-Brite Cube has smaller screens (6"" x 6""), so would be better off for 2-6 yr olds, but then we have the peg issue. These new pegs are made smaller and don't fit as well as he old ones do, so that means they have a tendency to fall out. It is really frustrating trying to make one of these images without having to put half of the pegs back in while doing it. My kids played with it all of 15 minutes before they got discouraged and bored withe nuisance. Furthermore, the light comes a conventional light instead of using a Fluorescent or LED to help promote energy conservation and a longer lasting bulb. All in all, for 30-40 bucks I think I would rather spend my money elsewhere on something my children will actually play with."
4,lite-brite,"The cube is great so more than one child can play with it at a time. Refills are hard to find, and more pegs would be nice especially if you have 4 kids playing at a time."
4,cube,Both of my girls really enjoy the lite brite cube. The only problem we had was that initially we had a hard time getting the pegs in.
2,Not what I thought it would be...,"Over 75% of the bristles in this brush seem to be plastic. In my opinion, it should be labeled a wooden brush with plastic bristles which includes some boar bristles."
1,I was excited.,Not even a week of using it and the bristles have already started falling out. :( I was looking forward to having this brush for awhile.
1,diane brush,This brush was no where near what I was looking for. I initially asked for a dubl duck brush with nylon bristles. It was more trouble sending it back than keeping it. So....I kept it.
1,false description,More plastic than boars hair. Description states one hundred percent boars hair but i would say it's ninety five percent plastic.
5,Great for knots,This brush does not hurt my daughter when I brush out the knots. There is no static build up like her other brush. Her hair looks thicker and fuller after brushing with this Boar bristle brush.
3,Not bad at all...,"This brush is not bad at all as a backup brush in the car or something. It is firm believe that. Its almost too firm. If you trynna set your waves though and your hair is kinda thick or just curly, pick this one up."
2,SCD not like it used to be.,In the old days SCD was a reliable source for prices of all kinds of memorabilia. Now it is just a trade magazine full of ads (@90%). Tuff Stuff not available online at least for now which would eventually be a much better source for getting price guides. Becketts are too expensive and only deal with one sport at a time.
4,Great Insight,"Very detailed. Better if more pictures were added.Truly explains how unique Senna was mainly as a driver and in all that he does. Without a doubt, he was the greatest."
4,For those who want to know about the best emotional driver ever,"Complete and detailed career of the best driver I've seen. Not as technical as Prost, Schumacher and onthers but with passion never seen before that easily surpasses small tech gaps making him the fastest driver seen on F1 racing world. Book is easy to read and includes lots of statistics."
2,"pas franais in ""Classic French Love Poems""","There are a number of very fine poems by very fine poets in this book. I was hoping this would be a dual-language book, hèlas, everything is in english. I have been learning the french language, and much of french poetry is wonderful, but in english, bien sr, ce n'est pas la mme chose!"
2,"Bosch 13354 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment","Great product, at half the price! (compared to Autozone and Pepboys) Installed it in under 10 mins, had to disconnect the battery to reset the computer. Since then, the ""check engine"" sign is gone, the car has slightly better throttle response and fuel mileage. Thank you Bosch and Amazon!Update 1: Went to my mechanic today for auto inspection test and it FAILED to pass the test. He recommended me to buy a new sensor at a dealer, which costs a not too shabby $118... Go figure. So far i give Amazon stars for service."
1,not usable,"I ordered 02sensor for 2000 toyota solara, site stated this would fit my vehiclewhen I recieved item I noticed plug connector was different and would not fit."
1,Bosch Oxygen Sensor Not,Yea the Sensor is OE which should be the official sensor one installs in a car. Turns out that was not the case. It would not fit in my Toyota Camry. I ended up having to sadder it in order to make it fit. Bad experiences all around. Bought a 70 dollar part and ended up having to destroy it to make it fit
5,Up North Again,"This book is an excellent guide to the flora and fauna of Northern Ontario. It includes interesting facts on animals and plants that will leave you saying, ""Wow!"". I highly recommend this book because it will open your eyes to a whole new world."
2,Not impressive.,"I bought these to keep my feet warm while motorcycling during winter. The first thing I noticed was they did not stay up! I was not even walking around, but was riding my motorbike and the socks slouched down into my boot. When I did get off of the bike, they were bunched up under my foot and around my ankle - which was not comfortable. Mind you, I am an 5'3"" and my calves are not large. I bought these due to the positive reviews and was greatly disappointed. I found the Wrangler boot socks work much better! These just were not worth the money!"
3,Ski socks,Warm and cozy with nice padding on front. Run a bit large so I recommend ordering a size down from your usual.
2,They run small!,"These were supposed to go up to women's size 9.5. I wear 8.5 shoe and I'm 5'6"" and they were too small on my feet and did not go up my calves high enough. They would be okay for a girl with small feet that is not very tall. I probably won't even be able to use them after I wash them."
2,Careful,"Purchasers should be advised that although the seller lists these as a ""set,"" what you get is one bracket and one backing plate. This should be made more explicit on the page. If you need to replace both brackets, you need to order two sets. Ordering one set will allow you to hang only one side of your pontoon ladder.Otherwise the order was fine and aside from a slow delivery it appears to be what is promised."
5,Timeless Instruction Book,"When I began playing banjo 25 years ago I got two books: The Scruggs Book, and this one. The Scruggs Book taught me 3-finger Scruggs-style play, and this one taught me melodic style. Combining the two creates a great style. This book forces you to ""get control"" of your left hand, as well as teaches you a huge amount about navigating the fingerboard. And it's all fun because you're playing fiddle tunes that sound nice. It's a must if you're serious about banjo pickin'. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! P.S.: I also lost mine over the years and just replaced it through Amazon.com. Didn't think I'd ever see it again!"
3,Disappointed,"While I am very happy to have this book; I've been wanting it for about three years now. I was disappointed to see that it was missing a page, not the patterns, but a page in the beginning and...one of the patterns and chart was written all over. I can still read the chart and pattern but....have to REALLY read so I don't mix things up. I understand the book was a used book but.. didn't know ""how used"" it was. Of course I won't return it, am happy to have it. This is my first experience in buying a used book so maybe that's the way they are?"
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"This video was more or less on how to BUY a digital camera, instead of how to use one."
5,Love this dining set,"This is a really nice dining set. It looks luxurious. It is well made, easy to assemble and it's real wood. The chairs look very nice. The size is just perfect for the small dining area in our apartment."
4,Great dining table set,"Prompt delivery, ease of assembly and decent quality of both the table and chairs gave me the satisfaction of making a good purchase.....however, the only negative is that the dining table finish is soft, so, it could leave minor scratches at times when bowls/plates/others with non-smooth finish are moved around......although, I must say, the scratches are not very obvious and don't take anything away from the beauty of this set......overall, a great purchase...and I recommend it highly......"
5,Loved it,"I bought this set for my best friend as her wedding gift and she loved it! she says it looks better in person, it was a great buy."
3,Good for Price,"I've recently purchased this dining set, and I have to admit it was quite easy to put together. The table looks great, but I was not quite satisfied with the appearance of the chairs - they are smaller and the color is less bright than the one on the picture. Other than that, the set is comfy and good for the price."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT,Xcite 60-1414-01-XC Xcite Holster for LG chocolate VX8500Xcite 60-1414-01-XC Xcite Holster for LG chocolate VX8500THE PRODUCT SHOWN HERE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE SENT TO ME WHICH IS POOR QUALITY PRODUCT. THIS SELLER IS LYING ABOUT THE PRODUCT WHICH HE IS SELLING TO GET RID OF POOR QUALITY STUFF.
5,Wonderful Genealogical Town History,"This is fairly complete history of the Town of Milford as of 1901. There are 1023 pages in the book and it is about three inches thick.It includes maps of the town, and photos and drawings of buildings and people.The first 390 pages are descriptions of various historical aspects of the town, with the balance of the book being biographical sketches of the for famous inhabitants of the town, along with family registers that list the basic information about many more inhabitants.This is a fabulous genealogical resource for anyone researching family members that lived in Milford, NH, especially during the 1800's.George A. Ramsdell, the author of the book, was obviously a very diligent historian that put a huge abount of work into creating the book. It looks like he spent about 7 years on the project, doing very detailed research to get his facts accurate. It appears to be very complete and is extremely detailed."
5,Pretty awesome,"Put these speakers in a 1998 Audi A4 but they needed to be slightly modified to install. Bought them to replace a blown speaker and wow these things sound great. They are phenomenally better than the terrible stock (non-bose) Audi factory speakers. Highly recommend these speakers to anyone interested in them, the highs are very crisp and these speakers handle bass better than I thought since they're only 4 inch speakers."
2,No warranty if purchased online,"I bought a pair of these just over a month ago for my 85 MB 300D. They sounded great for a month, then one blew on me. I wasn't pushing them too loud with a giant amp, just basic listening through a low end kenwood cd player. I was outside the 30 day return window, so it was left up to Boston Acoustics for a warranty. They informed me that only Crutchfield is an authorized online retailer (these were bought through Amazon by Discounts Jungle) and thus I had no warranty. So buyer beware, you're buying a product without a warranty, very nice."
2,"Good price, tinty sound","Good, fast service from the vendor, but the speakers sound cheap and tinty. No low end bass and even the lower end of midrange is lacking. That said, the stereo may be crappy and part of the problem on our end."
1,FYI: This is not written by the Apostle Robert D Hales,"Just wanted to let others know. This book was not written by the Apostle Elder Robert D Hales. This author is Robert ""E"" Hales, while the Apostle is Robert ""D"" Hales. Just felt I should point that out as one of the other reviews said that Elder Hales has good insights. Very similar sounding names but not the same person."
4,Great book for any nature center or natural resources students.,"I have only begun reading this book, but I already know that this will be a common find in my hand. The beginning chapters lay out wetlands for basic understanding and the plant descriptions and illustrations work well to identify plants. What a great find."
3,Chemical odor,The saffron arrived with a strong chemical odor. It may have been stored close to insecticides. Cooking did not remove the odor. We decided not to use it.
5,Spicy World Saffron,"Great packaging, very well sealed. Store in a dark place. I use this as an ingredient in my homemade seasoning that I use to sprinkle on foods before consumption and sometimes in the food itself. I like the quality, price and packaging."
2,chemical taste,"I have to agree with the bad reviews. Not only has a bad chemical odor/taste, but it doe not look fresh. Even my husband won't eat what I cooked. By the way the container/brand is not what is shown in the picture either."
3,Not of exceptional quality,"Given the rather exceptional rating to this product, I had expected them to be all pure red saffron stigmas. However, on closer examination of the product, the style/stigma of the saffron plant (yellow in color) seems to have been included. Basically, the yellow stigma has NO CULINARY VALUE, that means NO AROMA, FLAVOR or COLOR. The yellow stigma left attached to the red saffron adds upto 50% DEAD weight to the saffron, and you pay for it.Conclusion: Look elsewhere!"
1,Saffron light sensitivity,"From the looks of the package this saffron is exposed to light. The reason some views say that this saffron is weak is because some of the important chemicals involved in the aroma and flavor of saffron break down relatively fast in the presence of light. As such you'll notice high quality brands use opaque packaging, i would avoid this one if you're looking for quality."
2,Food sinks and makes a mess,Food Sinks and collects at bottom and partially disintegrates...Makes a mess. turtles didn't like it much either. Filter can't process the big chunks until it really breaks apart. I was disappointed and cancelled my regular subscription
5,good turtle food,"product was here quick, it is thinner sticks than other ones I bought but they are good for my smaller turtles too. They 3 turtles I have enjoy these sticks. They are also easy to store and to feed."
3,Shields not so Fenntastic,"Dean's personal struggle might have resonated with the audience better had Shields' performance convinced us that she put one second of effort into her role. Fenn's on-screen presence would have served as a more legitimate source of inspiration for Dean's development through the tale. Still, O'Malley and Fenn's performances evinced emotional honesty that rallied the audience in the end."
2,LID,This was a good story I liked this book alright it was not exactly what I was expecting. I would recommend.
5,Good value,"Excellent audio New Testament at a reasonable price. Johnston's voice is clear and sharp. There is a rather odd background music that steps forward into notice at times, an unneccesary addition but not an overly intrusive one. Its very handy to hear the correct pronunciation of some of those names in the NT, when I'm lector I'm sure I'm using Johnston's accent to pronounce some of those tongue twisters. This audio NT is just the thing for when you're driving, walking, or working and want to study the Word."
5,Awesome!,"I was on the fence about ordering these shoes, but decided to take a chance based on the customer reviews... I am so glad I did! These shoes were a perfect fit, comfortable, and look WAY better in person and on my feet! Thank you fellow reviewers!"
5,comfortable,I like naturalizers so ordering these shoes online I know that I will neverbe disappointed.
3,Mixed feelings...,"Unit worked really well for a month... then gave lots of erratic readings. Heater and sensor cal to no avail.Replaced sensor ($75), suspect exhaust temp was too high (installed just downstream from OEM WRAF). Installed heatsink on new, will see how long it lasts."
3,Very deep,This book is good but goes very deep into the subject of muliracial children. I have not really found a lot of answer that I expected to get in this book.
5,Wish this book was around when I was a kid..,"I experienced extreme self-hate and lack of awareness as a multi-racial child in the 80's. I never really knew my father and I didn't ""look black"" so I got a lot of the ""what are you"" questions. I never knew how to reply because ""multi-racial"" was never heard of back then. I would just say ""half and half"". I intend on sharing this book with my children who are of multiple races in hopes they will be brought up with higher self-esteem than my own. We have come a long way."
5,Finally a Book that Focuses on Asian-Caucasian children!,"Great book! I was pleased to find it because there seem to be so few books that discuss Asian/Caucasian multiracial issues as thoroughly as this one does. Most other books seem to concentrate on African American/Caucasian issues -- a worthy issue I'm sure, but not my life.I loved her organization: she concentrated on specific times in the children's lives and how they perceive race at each time. My smart, beautiful, Japanese/Caucasan daughter is only three, but I get the ""is she yours?"" question way too frequently.I'm sure I will be consulting this book for some time."
5,Polished and professional,"I like this watch because it delivers a pleasing design that is sophisticated and feminine as compared to the round faced clunky sport watches that are available. The Seiko watch is a great accompaniement to the gold bracelets I like to wear most of the time for business attire, and it successfully bridges with the silver jewelry as well. I like the slim bracelet profile it has, but I wondered if the tiny face would make it difficult to read the time accurately. It's fine. I trust that the Seiko brand will deliver accuracy and dependability as I have come to rely on with the other watches I already own. Lastly, the price is spectacular! It's a winner."
1,RUBBISH,"This disc advertises on the label that David Bowie sings lead vocals on the track 'I Am Divine'. He does not. In fact, he does not appear anywhere on this disc, excepting for some lyrics that he apparently wrote. Ava Cherry's singing is not distinctive, and the men who provide vocals are over the top. This disc is a disappointment all over."
1,Cliche's take shape before your eyes!,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. There's the expected amount of sex in this book, of various permutations, but the character-development and dialog were just awful. More than once I laughed out loud at the sheer clunkiness of the cliches the author brought into play. The author may learn her craft in time, but the reader is best advised to stay away in the meantime."
5,Coroner puts the rest in their body bags,"Coroner a highly underated band, Though they were not around for long they still kick much butt! The tracks are fast and furious and deserve much praise. Give em a listen. Coroner killed em all"
2,3D Glasses Review,"I still haven't been able to get these glasses to work yet. I am guessing that hardware incompatibilities are my problem. Is there a detailed list of hardware needed for these glasses to work? If so could someone please email me a copy. At norwoddm03@gmail.comThanks! Sincerely,Mark N 05/22/2011"
1,Did not work for me,Did not work for me. Poorly made. I tried calling the company they were very elusive. I have an ATI Radeon 5450
3,A sign of changing times and changing musical tastes.,"On this 1993 release, The O'Jays tried to strike a compromise between the 1970s Soul with which they are eternally associated and the 1990s Hip-Hop/New Jack Swing-influenced Urban R&B. While ""Heartbreaker"" is by no means a disastrous CD, it's by no means in the same league as their classic 1970s albums for Philadelphia International Records and the songs themselves are not particularly memorable or outstanding. Yes, it's admirable and commendable that The O'Jays (and their producers) tried to update their sound for the 1990s without ""selling out"" but the results were mixed at best."
4,As for accomodation guides ...,Hi all -I note that people have mentioned this guide is short on accomodation listings. The New Zealand Automobile Association (AA) and a company called Jasons both provide very detailed accomodation guides which you can pick up in NZ when you arrive. I think both of these are actually free too.Hopefully useful information from a resident Kiwi ... enjoy your travels!
4,An IRI for older students,"When I purchased this product I was looking for an IRI that would give me more information about how my students are thinking and interacting with text. These are intermediate students who do not seem to be making progress in comprehension, and I suspect this is because they are not using thinking strategies. This product certainly fit my narrow purpose perfectly. It might be good for a summer program, but it is not useful for wide-scale or frequent benchmarking/progress monitoring because it has only two passages at each grade level. I purchased this item used and felt it was well-worth the price I paid. I'm not sure I would pay full price for it."
3,"Design Flaws, but I'm Used to Cheap Watches...","The automatic function is very nice, that the watch 'knows' the time and automatically resets. It's cool to watch the hour/minute hands spin around and stop on the right time, almost spooky.The design flaws?1) very hard to read the actual time in poor lighting due to the reflective nature of the bezel and the hour markers. Completely impossible to tell the time in the dark. Who needs to know time it is in the dark any ways?2) Mine came with a black leather band, that wore out within 6ms."
3,Pet Shop Boys - Go West,"It was only a matter of time before the Pet Shop Boys took on The Village People, and the result is... really damn disco-licious. An uplifting throw-your-hands-in-the-air track about gay freedom and migration. Given that Brothers in Rhythm produced the album track, it's not surprising that their mix is simply an extension of the original with the minor key coda stretched to its limits, but the other mixes are similarly unscintillating. Farley & Heller, as good as they are, phone in their two mixes, while Kevin Saunderson's ""Tribe"" and ""Trance"" mixes are, sadly, neither tribal nor trance. But don't let the lackluster mixes make you overlook ""Shameless,"" a irony-laden b-side that's simply divine. All pop music should be this good."
3,Watch not exactly as described,"While this is a beautiful watch, it is not as described. It is described as a bangle watch, but it is not. It is a bracelet watch with links, which freely moves around the wrist. A bangle watch is rigid. I returned this watch because I was looking for a true bangle-style watch."
5,Great Product: Great Purchase,"This watch is gorgeous. I actually have one of the same but not with the black face. I always wanted a watch like this, but all I saw were unattractive.Just love it."
4,Pretty good,"I ordered this mascara on a subscription for my daughter and I every 6 months to save the extra 15% Amazon offers. That makes it $8.84 for two tubes or $4.42 each which is pretty cheap for any mascara. The lash brush kinda freaked me out at first, I thought ""this is lame, it's never gonna work"". But it actually does seem to go on well and separate lashes pretty good. I thought it looked fine and went on with my day. When my daughter came home from high school she looked at me and said ""Mom, your eye lashes are so perfect they almost look fake"" so I guess she could tell the difference between this mascara and my normal one (which is ""Voluminous""). I will continue my subscription every six months because the product is pretty good and inexpensive. I wouldn't say it was fabulous, but pretty darn good for every day use."
1,Good book to put you to sleep,"Had to buy the book for a class. The professor wrote it. The most pointless book I ever had to get. I learned absolutely nothing in this entire course. Goes to show that this is basically the capstone course for the CIS major at WMU at it was by far the most worthless class I've ever taken. The guy is completely full of himself and never makes any sense. I feel like Western Michigan wasted an entire semester of my life making me go to this guys class. His midterm was 10 questions and I knew only 2 questions. Somehow, I pulled a 97% on the exam and was absolutely shocked. Feel bad for anyone who has to purchase this book as it will more than likely put them to sleep."
1,I bought the Z845 a few months ago and I think it's junk.,"If I could give this thing a negative number, I would. I just threw away 2 large bags of brown sugar because, after I had thrown away the bags the sugar came in, I could not get the Z845 to work. What a mess! I had brown sugar all over that part of my kitchen.On a couple of occasions the sealer has worked without creating a vacuum. This time it appeared to be trying unsuccessfully to pull all the air out of the bag, but the bag never sealed.I have watched the video several times and have read and re-read the instructions. At first I thought I was not operating it correctly, but now I believe the Foodsaver is the problem. The first time I used it, to seal a quantity of chicken for the freezer, it worked beautifully. It hasn't worked right since then.Another problem is that it wastes an amazing amount of plastic material. Is it possible this thing was invented for the purpose of selling refills, rather than to work as a sealer?"
1,Do not throw your money away!,"I bought the unit about 4 years ago and it did not work. I went through about 4 replacement units that they sent me and could not get it to work properly. I have moved a few times since and just pulled it out and tried again. Believe it or not, it worked once and now will vacuum the back but will not seal. For a company as well-known as Foodsaver, I am surprised that it has ONLY worked once!"
3,Hidden shipping costs,"ordered extra bag material to supplement the vacuum system. K-rist, bag matl came from different locations which drove the priceway up.If I ever order from Amazon again I will get a firm price amount. Pretty damn schlocky."
3,Excellent music but ...,"Wonderful music.I am very glad to listen to this album.But,I wonder,this disk looks like copied media (maybe CD-R).Very cheep disk. It's so sorry."
3,Traditional thinking,"I purchased this book in the hopes that I would get some investment advice for burgeoning alternatives, but the best the author could do was advise in the traditional realms of thought in terms of investment including heavy investments in the most likely defense companies as countries attempt to fight over the last remaining pools of oil.The only positive I can say about the book is the authors' exposition on the way that home mortgages prop up the economy and how leveraged loans in the banking industry require a ""growth"" economy. This is very clearly explained and expounded upon. Additionally, the book makes it clear that when inflation is factored into the equation most stocks are a loss. So overall I think it is a good read, it just did not meet my expectations on advice for alternatives. I guess if you go by this author, there just is not anything to invest in in terms of green energy."
5,Powerful & Vital,"Having read numerous books on Peak Oil, I can honestly say that this one is unique.The authors have a very simple and engaging writing style. They explain in concise terms the concept of Peak Oil, and how this will affect the global economy and stock markets.The book is filled with invaluable advice and great ideas on where to hold your investments in the times ahead.Peak Oil will bring dramatic changes to our world, but this book creates a positive vision - one that shines through the usual doom and gloom scenarios that are painted by other Peak Oil authors.Essential reading."
2,Glaring ommission?,"I've read most of this book already and have skimmed the portions I have not read. I see absolutely NO reference to the oil reserves that supposedly lie in the Caspian Sea basin. Some have suggested reserves approaching those of Saudi Arabia. How can it be that this information is not incorporated into this book?I've also found the book a bit shallow and repetitive. It takes only few chapters to get the point. Much of the rest of the book simply states the same themes over and over in different ways. Someone could easily skim through this book for 15 minutes in the bookstore and walk away with all the knowlege it seeks to impart.The only saving grace to this book is the importance of the topic it discusses and, particularly for people ignorant of oil economics, for that reason it is a worthwhile read."
4,"A good and informative book, makes you think",What is the cost of a barrell of oil today? This book was very good then and it makes sense today. I think it's still current.
4,AHEAD OF THE CURVE,"Congratulations Dr S. Leeb for such an accurate & prophetic book. I finished reading this book on 17 Jan 12, so it was a retrospective read for me. It was eerily accurate to what has occurred since the writing of this book.Dr S. Leeb's main innovative idea in this book is to sell inflation investments once the crude oil price is 80% above its price 1 year ago & buy deflationary investments. Once the crude oil price falls 20% below its price 1 year ago, that is the time to switch back into inflationary investments.Dr Leeb has gone into many different types of businesses & investments in this book. Please take heed for any serious investor. Great prudent advise! Keep up the stupendous work, Dr Leeb!"
3,never got book to keep,"This book was received and mailed back the next day, May 9, 2009. The seller was very easy to work with and extremely kind."
5,"Dog likes it, we like it, ticks don't like it","Strong scent of citronilla. I spray a little on my hands and ""dot"" it on the dog's legs, belly, chest, neck, rump, and back. When we ""innoculate"" him before we take him out for his walks, we don't find ticks on him later.When I didn't, there was a tick that we found later, just from a 5 minute walk in our front yard.We feel this is an excellent product for both humans and dogs. Cats might not appreciate the smell, and I don't know if the product is cat-safe. Our cat doesn't go out so doesn't need it."
3,Intriguing Ideas ... bad copyediting,"I like the ideas in this book - the author is a former Catholic priest, and he draws from many religious traditions to make his points. His thoughts are clearly articulated and helpful to the spiritual seeker like myself.I'm disappointed by the quality of the text, however. I've noticed numerous copyediting errors that could have been easily corrected. Glad I only paid $1.79 for this!"
2,Boring and slow,"This ranks as one of the worst books I have read.I hate not finishing a book but I am giving up on page 236.This author is really into food descriptions and constantly repeating the meaning of privileged information and really not into action or plot.He also must be a bike enthusist as you are treated to descriptions that do not add to the story line over and over.This book can help you if you have problems sleeping,that how boring it is."
2,Could Have Been So Much Better,"Having read both Jonathan Kellerman's series on Alex Delaware and James Patterson's about Alex Cross I know that mysteries involving therapists and psychologists can be thrilling, entertaining and interesting. Stephen White manages to suck the life out his protagonist. The moral quandry had interesting ramifications, but it was discussed, debated and dissected ad nauseum. I wanted to scream, ""Stop talking and do something, anything!"" The love interest is annoying and the fate of his beloved Cicero is gratuitous and unnecessary. The last thirty pages of excitement did not make up for the other 200+ of boredom. I am assuming the books in this series get better, but I am not going to bother to find out."
3,Priviledged,"Since I live in the Boulder, CO., area this book was recommended by a friend. I took it as airplane reading and found time passed quickly. I have read three in the series now and have become bored with Dr. Alan Gregory. I may pick up the series some time in the future, but not any time soon."
3,Privileged Information,"When I picked up Stephen White's latest book, Warning Signs, I didn't relaize there was a whole series featuring Alan Gregory. So I wanted to start at the beginning. I have to say I found the first Alan Gregory novel a disappointment. It took me forever to get hooked on reading Privileged Information. I was very disappointed in this book, and almost quit reading it a couple of times. Fortunately I also picked up Higher Authority and read it in two sittings. Luckily Stephen White recaptured my interest."
4,Loved all these characters,"This was the first Stephen White book I read and after reading it I went out and got all the others in the Alan Gregory series. I really liked these characters and how they all interacted. And I enjoyed having the main character be different from the typical, swaggering hero. Here, he almost gets dragged kicking and screaming into the fray. And he has to use his wits to get himself out of trouble--not his muscle. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelligient thrillers/mysteries."
4,A compelling story,"This book is quite short, so I feel it doesn't do many areas justice. In particular, considering the book is called ""False Flag"", it details very little about Zeev Avni's False Flag operations.But where the book works is the account of Zeev Avni's life. He's a very compelling character, and his warm writing style really allow you to get into his mind and understand what motivated him in his varied life. From becoming a communist spy so he could gain acceptance when he was young, to ending up working on computers, all the key actions are laid out in his interesting life.I read with sadness now, finishing the book, that Avni died two years ago. I think I feel loss because the book really does allow you to get to know this man and his motivations, and mourn his passing."
5,Pure Summer Bliss,The return of the world's greatest band- sugary sweet Sarah Cracknell weaves the perfect summer melody of sublime aural landscapes - a siren for the soundtrack of life. Exquisite!
5,"An elegant mathematical treament of ""thingness""","A little tiny book that I have read scores of times in20 years. For the mathematically inclined reader, createsa formal seed upon which new, clear concepts will crystalizefor years. The high price will, unforturnately, discouragecasual readers."
2,Dissappointing,"The first DVD is a taped lecture Dolf gives to people in New Zealand. The only thing to be learned from the first disc is that investing in real estate can make you money and it is possible for everyone to do it. Nothing you couldn't have learned from the internet or reading a book for much cheaper. The other 5 discs are basically Q&A sessions where fans of his website send him questions and he answers them from different locations around the world. There is never any specific advice given on these locations and probably 90% of the questions will never apply to your personal situation. I was extremely disappointed with this product and would not recommend it. If you want to learn more about investing in real estate, try the book ""Investing in Real Estate"" by Andrew McLean and Gary W. Eldred."
4,An excellent book of poem stories about this man's life.,This is a very good book that has insipried me to keep writing poems (mainly to my girlfriend). The style of writing is very original even though that is how I have always written myself. Cheers to a very inspirational book with a deceiving title.
4,ANOTHER GREAT CARA COLTER ROMANCE,"I love the series, and this one was very romantic and fun to read. The series plots the characters all too close together... don't we all wish we'd met a prince to marry, and our sister turns out to be a princess... wouldn't all our problems be solved in a heartbeat! Other than the authors having to deal with the pre-arranged unbelievable plot, just sticking to the romance was fun, fun, fun. In this whole series, I've read the entire book before I've gotten any sleep! Keep it up!"
2,Read Suzanne Brockmann's Royally Wed book and end there,"This series has gone from okay to mediocre to just plain old bad.It started off with Brockmann's Undercover Princess (one of the first books) and then it deteriorated into royal books about ANOTHER family, and now it's just bad. This book had a ludicrous plot and silly characters.Don't feel that because you started the series you have to finish it."
2,Lots of fret buzz,I bought this to use as a practice bass and keep it near my computor so I could learn cover songs off of you tube.The fret board sounds like a buzz saw. Fret buzz on every string at almost every position. It also weights maybe 2 or 3 pounds more than my Gibson SG bass which is weird cause it is almost the same body size and style. I would never use it in a real gig.
5,Good Pickup,It had been a couple of years since I'd picked up a bass but I had been meaning to get back into for some time now. I did a little research on the newer models and decided to try out this epiphone model. I've been really happy with the shape of the bass and it's got a nice pickup. Good purchase overall.
2,just the same thing every one's have!,"well..this is the comercial trance.. it its good but every one have the same music! if u really know what is trance, buy Oakenfold, Fontaine, Sasha, Digweed,Tenaglia, Seaman, Dave Ralph or the Global Undergrounds! much better than this comercial trance... EL TRANCE ES LA MERA VERGA!"
4,TY Beanie Babies Georgette The Goose,"Attic Treasures Georgette the GooseThese are not really toys. I guess they could be played with, but I got it for decorating my kitchen, on a shelf.It added a nice ""homey"" touch."
1,Too easy and superficial.,"I wish somebody would have told me that this book is for beginners! It's a nice book, with nice pictures, and printed on fancy paper, designed for people with little computer knowledge. We all had to start somewhere, don't get me wrong, but if you are looking to get into the depths of Frontpage 2000, this book is not for you. For example, there is nothing that tells you how to work with frames (just two paragraphs in the Glossary section!) As I said, beginners will get what they paid for, everybody else will be left with disappointment."
2,"Easy, Too Easy","I was a newcomer to FrontPage, full of ideas and plans. This book did not help me. I was stranded. It is just too elementary in approach. I had a hard time even wanting to read it. May work for you, but I'd get Sam's Learn FrontPage 2000 in 24 Hours instead."
2,Not her best,"I really enjoy this author, but this is not her best work. I could not even finish it. The book was somewhat depressing and seemed to be pretty repetitive."
5,CANON SCANNER,I have had no problems with this scanner. The scans are clean and clear. The software that comes with the scanner is not all that good.
5,Very pleased,"I have used my CanoScan 8600F to scan newspaper and magazine articles (both color and black&white), and photographs. I have been very pleased with the results. I had no trouble in setting the scanner up with my iMac using OSX 10.4.10 and I quickly learned how to use the scanner. I really like the Photoshop Elements 4.0 software that comes with the scanner and this was a factor in choosing this scanner. I look forward to using it to scan some slides."
5,Replaced an HP flatbed and a dedicated Minolta film scanner!,"The Canon CS8600F takes up a lot less workspace, and provides better results with copies than the HP 7400c, and better results with less effort than the Minolta DiMAGE Scan 5400 Elite that it replaced. Optical resolution exceeds that of either of its predecessors. The scanner itself is compact, attractive, and was very straightforward to set up. I like that it has an accessible power button (the HP had none), so that it need only be powered on when necessary. Startup time is minimal. The front-panel buttons (actually on the lid) are right where they're needed. Can you tell? I love my new scanner!"
5,CanoScanCS8600F-A good product,"For several years now I have been using the Canon LiDE scanners, most recently the 70 model. This scanner is faster and ""feels"" more durable. Of course the smaller ones that I've been using are more portable, which helps if you need to take it with you to different locations. The 8600 was purchased specifically to scan hundreds of old slides that we have at work. This is the first time I've scanned slides but the 8600 is easy to use, works fast, and produces good quality scans. I am very satisfied with the CS8600F."
2,outdated software,"I just purchased the scanner as a replacement for an old Visioneer scanner that served me well until we replaced our computer which came with the Vista operating system. We had to upgrade the scanner and after reading many of the reviews went with the Canoscan 8600f. While, I am ok with the scanner so far I was extremely disappointed that it came with an outdated copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements v 4.0. This version is not supported by Vista requiring us to purchase an upgrade for $79.99. This raises the price of the scanner considerably. I am not one to purchase upgrades to software unless there is a compelling reason to do so and to have to purchase an upgrade right off the bat is galling to me. I think Adobe should offer an initial upgrade upon first time installation. If considering this scanner and if the software is important to you be aware that Adobe Photoshop Elements v4.0 is not supported by Vista."
4,Price,Purchased this scanner 1 week ago and seems to work great so far. I've used it to scan slides and they come out great. My only complaint is with Amazon as the price went down right after I purchased it. Be careful about that.
4,"President,Friends of Hart mountain","We bought ths scanner so that we could convert many years of old slides and photos at our refuge sor use in a variety of ways. Was not sure what we would get for this price, but went ahead. I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality and and happy with this product. Instructions on hard copy were nil so if you need your hand held while you learn there is not alot there. But it was easy to set up and we are on our way."
5,Very Pleased,"While I am certainly no expert on scanners, I read several reviews before purchasing this one. Have not used it much since my purchase but I can honestly say that it is a breeze to set up and use. I NEVER used a scanner before and had this up and running in 15 minutes flat. And the quality, at least in my opinion, is superb. Have used it to scan documents and old slides from my years in Vietnam in the 60s. The pictures come out better on the computer screen than the original slides did when projected on a screen. Definitely recommend it, especially for the price. I mean, under $200, and you can scan slides, film, medium format. You can't go wrong."
5,Canon 8600F,"I cannot say enough about this scanner. Just finished scanning almost 2,000 slides dating back to the 1970's and everything came out wonderful! This was definitely the way to go, rather than having a professional business do the same thing for much, much more cost. I saved money, enjoyed digitizing my slides and was completely satisfied. Even the software was/is easy to use. Thank you Canon for an excellent product."
5,Great scanner,Love this scanner! Made excellent scans of 35mm slides I have and also I love being able to create a pdf of a series of pages at the touch of a button. I'm a graphic designer so this allows me to send off a series of rough sketches quickly and easily in one file! WEorks great on my Mac OS X 10.4.
1,Excellent scanner,"I had some initial setup problems - which turned out to be my fault. I'm still trying to upgrade my rating from one to five stars. So if it's still one star, kindly disregard that."
3,serviceable,"The scanner itself works fine (albeit rather slowly), but the various software that comes with it is roundabout and clunky."
5,Best bang for the buck,"I bought this scanner to finally digitize a rather large collection of 35mm negatives and slides. After a small amount of jiggering, I am steadily reducing the physical pile and getting great images, enhanced when neded to overcome fading and grain. I haven't explored all the possibilities of the software that came with the scanner other than fade correction -- which works fine. Most of the enhancements I do in PhotoShop and, on balance, the scanner is terrific.One downside: it is not the fastest. To scan slides with enough resolution takes about 4 minutes each."
5,Great scanner,"Because I am an illustrator and a MacBook Intel user I was concerned about choosing a reasonable scanner and one that would work well with my MacBook. After researching what was available and for what price I chose the CanoScan 8600F. I am very pleased. No problems at all, easy to use and a great price."
3,Excellent item and quality for the price.,"I got this for my girlfriend because she loves cats, but developed an allergy to them. Siamese are her favorites so she was very happy when she saw it. The quality is great and it feels soft. I've purchased a couple of stuffed animals for her in the past and like those, this one came vacummed sealed in a plastic bag. The problem with that is that they usually have a slight oder to them when you open the package. Just be sure to air it out for a day before givining to that special someone. Also, it made the whiskers curl down and they don't seem to want to go back to a relaxed position. That's my only complaint."
1,Speak & Learn! Cantonese by EuroTalk Interactive,"Speak & Learn! Cantonesethis product is out-dated, virtually useless...a bad joke...paid for it through CSROMUSA and since i opened the plastic wrap, they wont take it back...buyer beware...DO NOT BUY this useless product...i am using it for a doorstop now..."
4,Light and Honest,"This movie surprised me. I like Lucy Liu and decided to give it a chance. For a cable movie, it really got into the heart of relationships and shows the light and dark sides. Lucy is just delightful. The script is intelligent. All in all, as far as chic-flicks go, this is a cut above the rest."
2,Don't understand all the five star reviews,"I guess I had a different expectation based on all the stellar reviews. These dive balls drop immediately to the bottom and are difficult to see underwater. You have to be swimming right on top of them to see. My seven year old daughter also has the dive rings, and these dive balls do not compare. You get twice as many rings for half the price of these dive balls. They're both easier to see underwater and easier to pick up. A little disappointed...."
4,One of the great books on art theory.,"Although somewhat dated in that what Dewey novelly stated long ago, we now accept as obvious, this is a great book to gain an understanding of art both as a producer and as a spectator.The central theme is that life is an experience, and that the goal of art is to recapture that experience. Hence, a painting of a flower is only valuable in the way that it captures the essence of a flower, or the experience of viewing a flower. The viewing of a painting must also provide some of the experience of making that painting ( its process ).If you can manage to finish the book ( the style is a bit archaic ), the experience is worth the effort."
4,Overly Detailed but Insightful,"It's a little thick, but you have to consider it's based off of his lectures. From the point of view from a philosopher, he gives insight into things that we as artists might already know, but have never realized, and even other stuff that's impossible to see that only someone from the outside could see."
3,Ambivalent,"This book was part of the assigned reading for a university seminar entitled ""Art and Society."" I was given to understand that although it was written 70 years ago, it is still considered to be 'the word' on the subject.The evolution of the arts, and the increased access to them by ordinary people since this book was written make some of it irrelevant today. Then, there's the 1930s acadamese language. I think most of the seminar attendees (these included doctors, lawyers, a judge, a diplomat, and many university-level educators) found it a difficult read. As one put it, unless your passion is philosophy, discussing philosophy is a lot more fun and rewarding than reading it.I am a practicing studio artist and arts advocate of several decades experience, and a voracious reader."
4,Nice HRM and Fitness Buddy,I purchased this to get in better shape. First time using a HRM. It took some getting used to and fiddling with the workout programs to really make it worth while. After 3 months I am very happy with this item.I would give it 5 stars however the watch face scratches too easily. I would have expected a stronger crystal (or perhaps saphire) for an item that is to go with you to the gym. I see the life expectancy for this reason to be at about a year or so.
4,Polar HRM F-11,"The F-11 is an excellent partner if one is considering a ""techy"""" way to monitor one's cardio fitness. The improved flexible chest strap is much more reliable and comfortable than the older hard plastic variety. The total functionality of the HRM is amazing, but is not the most approachable interface. The owner's manual (or novella) is somewhat helpful, but one has to use the HRM for a few weeks before all the advanced features are comprehendable. The ""sonic link"" or weblink is the coolest way to keep track of one's excercise progress. My computer's original microphone was inadequate and I had to upgrade the microphone in order to use the Sonic Link feature. It still has sporadic trouble linking tto the webpage and transferring data.All in all, The Polar F-11 is worth spending a few extra pennies for the adavnced features and wearable comfort."
3,Good Motivator,"I have had this HRM for a few weeks now and overall it is made well...fairly user friendly and definitely reliable. I am a pretty intense runner so ultimately I think I could have stepped up to one of Polar's running based HRM. Nevertheless, the built in diary does a great job of keeping me motivated. I think you need the mentatility first, but if you have the desire, you will be happy each week to see how you have progressed"
2,Bad one in the batch,"I read reviews to find the best heart rate monitor on the market. They all said ""buy the Polar F11"" so I did. In 18 months I replaced the battery in the watch three times and in the chest strap four times. I experienced eratic readings more than anything else -heart rates from 0 for most of a long run or 220+ when I was running easy. It would hop from low to extremely high to about right and then go to zero. When I sent it back to Polar along with a letter to tell them the problems I had with it, they sent me a bill for $50 and all they had done was replace the batteries... again. I was really disappointed with my experience especially after reading the reviews."
3,Great HRM - Poor Service,Pros:Excercise program is nice. Has workout history.Cons:Displays Heart Rate or % of Max. Would be nice if it alternated between the two like it does at the end of a workout.Mine lasted less than 6 months. Started showing irregular heart rate / no heart rate. Polar support said to replace the battery in the transmitter. Didn't help. Original battery tested fine (supposed to last 2500 hours). Had to send it in for warranty repair. Took 2 weeks and I had to pay shipping both ways. No cross ship available.
1,You are not allowed to enter the target heart rates directly,"You can't simply enter what heart rate targets you want - it only gives you ones it makes up on its own. You even must enter what DAY you were born, before you can use it - preventing others from using it without loads of set-up time. If the watch strap breaks, you must BUY A NEW WATCH because the strap is unusual. Many of the features can't be used without additional software and trouble."
1,Works great. . .for about 6 months.,"If you want a great heart rate monitor for about 6 months then this is the one for you. Mine no longer monitors my heart, but it is still an attractive sports watch, even after new batteries. I would have given more stars for the 6 months that it worked, but I subtracted a star for every $40 or so that I paid for it."
1,Buttons are too sensitive and activate features when you don't want them!,"I've had this product for a couple of years now. I bought it after one of the plastic buttons on my old Polar watch broke.The problem with this watch is that the buttons on the side are too easy to press and there is no ""lock"" feature to keep them from being pressed. Because of this, whenever my wrist is cocked at an extreme angle, the back of my hand pushes in on one of the buttons on the right side of the watch or pushes the watch in such a way as to push a button on the left side.Because of this, it is always going into some mode that I don't want. And when I have tried to use the more advance functions, it often resets because of the way I moved my hand that causes a button to be pushed. So, I only get a full log of my workout about half the time.Based on this and the problem with my previous Polar HR watch, I won't be buying one of their watches in the future."
5,Fantastic,"I'm writing this more as a counter to the previous reviewer's erroneous statements and bewildering rating. He claims it is good, but does not account for the 3/5 stars. Brett is great, the story is classic. The translation is perfect. And furthermore, this is not a story about Holmes's ""retirement"" years - adapatations be what they may, Doyle's story occured not too long after Watson's marriage - Holmes was middle aged at most and quite active. Brett's illness and age causes a slight alteration of feel in this regard... but that is immaterial to the point.Then again, anyone reading these comments probably knows the stories well and know how good the actors were in their parts in this series. No need for me to preach to the converted."
4,good little speakers,These are perfect for travel and are very good to be so small (MUCH BETTER than the internal laptop speakers).
5,Decent sound and portable,"These speakers have better sound then the ones in my MacBook and are really easy to carry around in my bag. They are usb powered so there is no need for a power brick or batteries. They do lack a little on the bass side, but that's a trade-off for portability. I think that Logitech could have made the carry case also hold the cable internally rather then using the exterior velcro loop."
3,"Decent value, good product","I bought a pair of these a long time ago for their portability. They are great to travel with, and decent notebook speakers for one of my company's work computers. If you want something to use at home for music or media, I would recommend getting something bigger and better quality. For basic sound and travel, however, these are perfect. They have lasted a long time and I expect to get many more years out of them. Installation and compatibility were not issues for me on any Windows OS attempted."
4,Absolute Pleasure to Use,"I have the first version of this product, the one without the 3.5mm jack on the back and the third button.Cons:-Such small speakers don't do bass very well.-Can't plug headphones into the speakers. Have to unplug speakers and then plug in headphones to get sound or reassign the output manually in Windows. (Only a problem with this version I assume.)-Can't get very loud in some programs.Pros:-Excellent sound. Can't be overstated. I've been using these things for months and am still surprised by the clarity of the sound they produce each time I turn them on.-Super Portable.-Simple as speakers will ever be.-Just plug them in and Windows automatically assigns them as the main output."
3,Logitech USB Notebook Speakers,"Overall I am satisfied with these speakers. They are easy to set up and there aren't a lot of wires to clutter your work space since they are USB driven. They also look nice. My only complaint, and it is not a big one, is the volume control on the speakers themselves. Very poor volume control. I had to add the volume button to my notification area so that I can control the volume that way. It is not a big deal and that gives me control of my laptop's volume more efficiently. The speakers have decent sound although at the higher volume they sound rather tinny. I had a larger set of HP speakers that sounded better but they had way too many wires. So I am satisfied with these Logitech speakers and would recommend them to anyone with limited work space."
4,Good Sound,"These speakers make the difference about laptops sound, great sound and very portable. I recomend."
2,Distorted sound,"This USB type of speaker gives very poor sound, noticeably distorted with limited frequency range. As my Mac does not have line output for sound, only headphones, I was hoping for bigger, more powerful sound by buying these Logitech speakers. The sound was actually better plugging ordinary (non-USB) speakers into the headphone jack."
5,Very impressive speakers,"very compact unit, amazing sound quality, good price.I would suggest these to anyone with a small desk or tight budget."
5,Small speakers with a BIG sound!,These speakers are just the best laptop speakers on the market! The price is amazingly low for what you get. Come in a handy storage case which makes them an easy carry in your laptop bag. I work on computers from time to time and always use these rather than going through the trouble of hooking up regular speakers. The USB hook-up is sweet... no use for bulky power cords. This recent set I bought was actually for a friend of mine because he saw mine and had to have a pair of his own... great buy... great product! If you need an inexpensive pair of awesome speakers ya need to buy em... you won't be sorry!
1,Low-end is distorted and farty. Unlistenable!,"I'm generally a big fan of Logitech's products, but this was really a miss. The bass is pretty awful and will make all of your music sound like someone is beatboxing over the kick drums. EQing out the bass in iTunes helped a little, but still did not remedy the problem.I ended up returning them. Got the Yamaha NX-U10 unit instead (USB Powered Stereo Speaker) and am extremely happy with it!"
3,Good not great,"Bought those for portability and because my tablet computer speakers are terrible. Good sound quality, volume control with separate +/- buttons not the best design compared to a more efficient dial-style. Generally, my experience with Logitec products is positive. If you're looking for hi-fi in small package, these are not it. Overall good enough sound quality for the price. Amazon price (I shopped around) and delivery time were excellent."
4,speaker review,Speakers are small and portable with a carrying case included. Speakers sound very good for the price. The volume is sometimes difficult to adjust to a satisfactory level when listening to something other than music. Overall very satisfied with this product.
1,No sound,"I bought these trying to replace a low end Logitech model that had begun shorting out. The volume with these cranked up all the way is a fraction of what my older, cheaper speakers put out and I don't think the sound quality could possibly be more inferior than it is.I was skeptical when reading the reviews of others that stated they couldn't get any sound out of these speakers. I foolishly thought, ""They just need to go into the control panel and change the settings. It can't be that bad. I never crank my music or videos so I'm sure it'll be fine."" I'm not an audio-phile either so I didn't think I would notice a big difference in the quality. Obviously I was wrong on both counts. If I can tell these things sound bad, then so can you!Do not buy these speakers."
3,"okay, a little disappointed","These speakers were great at first. The size is perfect for a laptop and the sound quality was great out of the box. The volume does not get very loud - at max volume, we couldn't hear it from several feet away in a dorm room with the AC on. Granted, it was an older, louder AC unit, and we were streaming Netflix, but it was still a little disappointing. After about 6 months, the speakers started to go, and there was a lot of distortion. They are still kicking after several years and some abuse, but the sound quality is poor. Not a bad price, and great for travel, small & quiet spaces, or infrequent use."
5,perfect pitcher,"I was looking for this style pitcher since I broke mine and was having trouble finding a similar replacement. I used it for cream but also for flowers. Great price and good quality but most importantly great style. I bought 3 together (different sizes) and two seemed to be from same company and one totally different. But, they all came packaged together and done perfectly so as not to break them. Fast shipment. Very impressed"
4,nice but small,"Quality wise this item is great, it's just small. I thought it was a water pitcher size but it more of a 'creamer in your coffee' size. My fault, i should have read the dimensions more carefully."
3,Perfect size but drips,"Perfect size for holding cream for coffee in the AM, but no matter what I do one or two drops slide down from the lip and down the front of the pitcher. Heavy weight is nice."
4,Sturdy little pitcher,"I use this to heat up syrup for pancakes, and will also use it for creamer when company comes.Using this pitcher is much better than dealing with my husband trying to stick the whole syrup bottle in the microwave (face palm).It has thick walls and will last a long time.I recommend it."
3,Great Size (16oz),"Like the looks of this pitcher and its size, but it tends to dribble when pouring. Will save it for backup."
5,KYB 341331 GR-2,"I needed new shocks for my car. Several quotes from local repair shops quoted $160+ per shock. After doing research, I found these KYB shocks on Amazon. Despite the ""Does this fit my car"" function of Amazon stating it did not fit my car, this particular shock 341331 does fit a 2004 Honda Accord as the rear replacements. I'd recommend checking KYB's online catalog to verify the correct part for your car, and front/rear installation.On to the actual review. The replacements were installed by a local mechanic as I didn't have the tools needed. The price of this part on Amazon is superior to what I found shopping at local repair shops plus free 2 day shipping and no sales tax. The shocks themselves make a huge difference in the ride of the car. I didn't realize how bad my old shocks were until I rode in 4 new shocks. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and feel of the new shocks."
1,Utter Crap,"Lame. She repeats the phrases ""My husband, my hubby, and Motor City Madman"" hundreds of times and makes sure that we know she is a rock star's wife. She keeps trying to convince us that they are still happily married after Ted's affair, and she never fails to remind the reader of what an amazing, talented, athletic, brilliant, well-versed, (did she say amazing 300 times?) man she is married to. She criticizes Van Halen's contract clause about no brown M & M's in their dressing room, which they did to make sure their contracts were being read, but tells the reader repeatedly how many people stole from The Nuge (her phrase, not mine). She just has to bring up that Gene Simmons had different girlfriends on the road during his marriage. Why are you telling us this, to justify what your husband did? The more she talked about how happy they are (which is the entire book), the less I believed it. Disappointing and annoying, don't waste your time."
1,A Mighty Yawn !,"Mrs. Motor City Madman's book was stale before it flopped off the presses. The sole purpose of a ""tell-all"" is to have something to tell,and Nugent has absolutely nothing worth saying. After all,she married a drug-free church-going republican,so go figure where this book is headed. Boooorinnggg!!! Add the fact that before she married Nugent she didn't do a damn thing herself! I don't take displeasure in this book because perhaps our politics don't match (and believe me,this broad can PREACH!) but simply for lack of anything worth reading. Hey lady,stick to the gory cookbooks..."
3,It grows on you...,"An interesting listen but only a few tracks stand out and the highlight really is the amazing ""9 PM (Till I Come)""... it's kinda like Eiffel 65's Europop, not great but it definitely grows on you..."
5,I openly admit that I am biased...,"ATB is my favorite artist, and Movin' Melodies is my favorite album by a landslide. I'll have to say, a lot of my absolute favorite songs have come off this CD: 9PM (Till I come), Don't Stop, Too Much Rain and Sunburn are just a few.If you are new to trance, this CD would be a great starter/introduction of the way trance is supposed to be done. And if you appreciate good music period, you should definitely add this to your collection."
4,Definitly Movin'!!,"ATB surprised me with this album. Trancy to no other, and it's great trance. I usually don't buy ""produced & performed"" cds, but ""9pm (Till I Come)"" and ""Don't Stop"", are very uplifting and ""happy"" tunes, and will be classics forever!! But, you must have an ear for Trance or you will not like this CD. 4 1/2 Stars. Beautiful!"
2,"Trance listeners, don't buy this CD!","Believe me, I did not buy this CD. I happened to pick up a copy from my sister's old collection, and I can see why it was stashed in the back of that abyssal pit--most of the songs are trite and in no way movin' melodies. If you appreciate the same song on one CD, buy it. Don't get me wrong, German Trance is some of the best stuff out there, but may I suggest Global Trancemissions or perhaps an album by Astral Projection. Pass this one up."
5,question for ATB fans,"Hey, does anyone know what Yolanda Rivera's spanish vocals are at the start of 9Pm?"
5,Movin Melodies-<~>-ATB what a genious,"I have to give ATB hard props on this album!!! This is one of most listened to cds ever. If you are into DEEP Chiller trance this has got to be a must for every techno, trance, and elektronica lover out there!!!"
4,AWESOME TRANCE MUSIC!,"I love this cd from ATB,he's a good musician from germany.I was hook on some of the track I love so much,like EMOTION,UNDERWORLD, 9PM (Till I Come),Don't Stop,Obsession(This is my very favorite song,ATB use a saxophone and is sound good!)If you like to be on the beach relaxing,try listening to ""Beach Vibes By EFF"".You hear a ocean splashing at the beginning for 25 sec. and you hear a cool beat music slowly emerging and the rest,you need hear it by yourself.ATB make a cool trance music using a different instrument for some of his music,""nice work ATB!!"""
3,ok cd,"i heard the samples and bought the cd and it didn't turn out the way i thought....it's a good cd, don't get me wrong but it wasn't all like i read in the other reviews in my opinion."
4,Robert Miles fans will enjoy this...,"If I had to describe this cd using only one adj., I would have to refer to it as ""soothing"". It's what I call trippy trance...you can dance to it or you can chill with it...""9 PM (till I come)"" is so overplayed (alright, you heard a cool tune, settle down) that you know this cd will be bought by sorority girls who heard the single at a local bar. It's like, sooo coooool to trance out...anyway, the cd is worth adding to your collection though a lot of the tracks seem to sound the same...there is a theme that binds the cd together. Those of you who have the Robert Miles cd ""Dreamland"" know what I am refering to...the songs all fit together...they seem to sound the same yet they don't...so listen to the cd at high volume under flashing strobe lights... For new ATB fans may I recommend ""Ministry of Sound Clubbers guide to...Trance"" mixed by ATB. Now that is a cd worthy of no other...NOT to be heard at a frat party anytime soon!"
2,This is incredible boring CD ! Sorry,"I have the same think to say about this CD as others Reviewers...This CD don't lok good in my CD player...Ibiza...If you wan't to buy something whit ATB then buy Ministry Of Sound ""Clubber's Guide to..Trance Mixed by ATB""(Great Mix of 9PM(till i come) by Matt Darey)."
1,"Complete ""Cheese Trance""","If you bought this cd, sell it! This is not what trance music is! This cd is just on the shelves to make money just like all those other ""cash-in"" trance compilations hitting music stores in the US. Real trance is almost dead and the trend now has become progressive house. If you want to get a feel for a real set, pick up any Global Underground album or any cd that doesn't sell its tracklisting, but rather relies on the reputation of a dj spinning underground non ""top 40 garbage!"" Also try Chris Fortier's Trance America. No hype, just good trance!"
1,Garbage Music For Simple Minded People,"Alright, ""9pm(Till I Come)"" Was Pretty Good When It Was First Released, But Thats About All ATB Has Goin For Him. This Entire Album Is All Based Around That Annoying Little Twangy Guitar Sample Heard In....Well, All His Songs On This Album. What An Insult To True Fans Of Trance & Electronic Music. ATB Along With DJ Sammy, Darude, Lasgo, Ian Van Dahl, Alice Deejay ETC, ETC Made Trance A Dirty Word And For That Any True Fan Of Trance Should Boycott All These Fake Artists Music, And Welcome True Trance Talent Paul Van Dyk, Matt Darey, Tiesto, Cristopher Lawrence, and Others Back For Some Real, True, & Intelligent Music, Burn This Album!!!!"
5,Perfect for Trance Lovers,"I think this is a wonderful CD. It has such a variety of songs, you never get tired of it. Soothing songs like Underwater World, Obsession, Sunburn and Too Much Rain are great for the Trance Lovers. 9 p.m Till I Come, Don't Stop & Killer are great too, if u want to have a party and have some good party music. The only dissappointment is that 3 of the tracks sound pretty much the same. Nevertheless, an extremely wonderful effort from ATB!"
4,Not living up to its full potential...,"Besides 9PM and Don't Stop, the rest of the album is .... not bad. It *could*, however, be a lot more richly textured and more complex (i.e. something by Paul Van Dyk, who weaves 5-6 diff. melodies and sounds within a track for full aural bliss.) ATB sounds a little elementary and too simplified compared to a true trance album, and i'm not even an expert DJ or full-on trancer/raver! Even newbies to this genre will realize that this cd is ""missing"" something. It's just not enough. You are left wanting something more complex, more rich.. like you had a plain vanilla ice cream w/o any toppings, cones, or cherry. =( Anyhow, if i had to pick two tracks (besides the 2 singles)that help make me give this album 4 stars, it's SunBurn and Too Much Rain. Overall a listenable cd, but not one that is a masterpiece."
1,Derivative cheese trance,"Just as the title of this review says, it's derivative - not in any way original.. has a few catchy melodies-very basic melodies.. Good for the masses I suppose.. Definately not for me.. You want real electronic music that still has a moderately ""catchy"" appeal to it? Check Way Out West, or BT - if you feel you can handle some basic breaks maybe even go for Hybrid (which as their name implies, is a Trance/Breaks/orchestral hybrid). That should whet your appetite a bit. These trance songs are a dime a dozen, equivalent to the pop icons everybody loves (and loves to hate).."
4,This CD has only two sounds ...,Both sounds are great. But the entire CD has only two sounds.Wish there are more within this CD ...
1,You Know This is Wrong,These DVD's are free from Mike Hoggard at Bethel Church and you can watch this for free right now on you tube [...] this person should be ashamed of themeselves..
2,"As nostalgia goes, this is a blast--otherwise, no good","The back cover of this entertainment-magazine-type book gushes ""they are the rage of the eighties, and they are here to stay!""It's funny to see a snapshot of young hot stars from the 80s, the latest decade to be remembered with warm nostalgia. Some of their up and comers have gone on to long-lasting stints on the A-list, and some have become C list jokes.The material about each actor is pure fluff, consisting of a multi-page biography and a black and white glamour shot or two.The actors covered:Molly RingwaldMichael J. FoxAlly SheedyTom CruiseDemi MooreRob LoweLaura DernRalph MacchioPhoebe CatesAnthony Michael HallEmilio EstevezAlyssa MilanoScott GrimesThe Cosby Kids (Bonet, Bledsoe, Warner and Pulliam), and""Stars From Britain,"" consisting of Helena Bonham Carter, Daniel Day Lewis, Margi Clark and Alexandra Pigg"
3,very stylish,"I've only heard one song ""Flower"" and it's very similar if not a remake of a Victoria Beckham song ""every part of Me"""
2,More Kirk hero-worship from Shatner,"C'mon, Bill. Give the now 200-year old Kirk a rest and let it go, already. Continues Shatner's trend of being unable to write a Trek novel in which his love for himself isn't splashed all over the book."
2,Predictable and Boring,"Confusing, not up to the standards set in The Return. One hopes Mr. Shatner's next effort will be better."
3,Too Ambitious,"This last book in Shatner's Mirror Universe series could have been so much better if they had dealt just with the mirror universe. Unfortunately Shatner and company have tried to tie almost everything that has happened in the ST universe into one cosmic conspiracy. Captain Kirk should be everyman, not a cosmic puppet or instrument of destiny. Ashes From Eden was a great book, they have gone down hill from there. This book I have to say will only appeal to ST fans, and the prior two books need to be read before this one. I hope the next book about Kirk returns him to who and what he is best, a Starfleet officer, a starship captain. That was his first, best destiny."
5,Great conclusion,"Shatner followed up the shortest Trek novel he has written with the longest. The first two books had a lot of questions, and PRESERVER delivers the answers to all of them in a very satisfying conclusion. Paramount should take note of Kirk's continuing popularity and bring the character back on film. The fans want it, and so does Shatner. And PRESERVER's ending was on such a high note that no true Kirk fan could feel unsatisfied. I can't wait for Shatner's next book, and I hope he continues bringing life to the Kirk character for years to come. And as for the TNG crew, it's ashame the writers on TV don't show the original series as much respect as Shatner shows TNG. I found myself clapping out loud for some of the moves Picard pulled in PRESERVER. The friendship between Kirk and Picard has developed over the Shatner books, to a great level of respect and comraderie. As is the case with the original series, TNG fans should love this book as well."
4,Great conclusion to the Mirror Universe saga!,"Well, all of the answers are there to the questions I had asked earlier in the previous two books. This was a great read, and much better than the last two. I won't spoil the ending for those who have not read it yet, but it's a little sad at the end, plus it leaves the door open for more books! So, how will Kirk finally meet his fate? Hopefully we'll find out soon. And one other thing. Will there be some story out of all of this saying what happens to McCoy? Being that it is now impossible for him to do any guest appearances on any incarnation of ""Star Trek"", shouldn't some story be written on him? (May he rest in peace).Remember, read the first five book before reading this one. Great stuff."
3,Well written but a disappointment,I have just finished reading Preserver. Though well written Kirk seems out of character though the character does follow the other Shatner novels. We get lots of action in this quick flowing book but we never really see the Preservers to any satisfying extent. We see lots of intregue within Starfleet but none of it is explained by books end. I found this book to be average and a rather disappointing read.
4,A return from ASHES,"Shatner's books (ghost-written with the Reeves-Stevens) do stand apart from the other Trek books ... but since THE ASHES OF EDEN, the books have paled by comparison to one another.PRESERVER re-establishes Captain Kirk to his proper place in the Trek mythos ... and it re-establishes the team of Shatner, Judith & Garfield Reeves-Stevens to their place of authority in the Trek publishing circle.PRESERVER is, at times, befuddling and frustrating ... much like the lessons of life, the one central theme in all of the book. It's a tale told at a brisk pace and a narration rising to an incredible climax ... making the reader question, much like Captain James T. Kirk does better than any other fictional character his age, ""what precisely are we here for?""An excellent read."
4,"It was good, but not great","I thoroughly enjoyed the book, couldn't put it down. However, I felt a lot like I was reading a TNG screenplay because there was so much talking. I was a little surprised at how quickly it turned. The first couple of chapters took up right where Dark Victory left off, but then it turned in to a whole different book with a different story and drastic character changes.The Return is still the best."
3,It's O.K. Just Not My Favorite,"Out of the Shatner Alternate Universe trilogy, this is probably my least favorite. Something about it just wasn't that interesting, even though it was the conclusion of the trilogy. Good beginning, it keeps up with the momentum of the two previous books, but it slowly goes down hill until the sad and happy conclusion. Kirk loses something, yet something is also gained. The main problem I had with it was within the title itself. I just didn't find the Preservers interesting. Like I said, I have read worse, but out of this Shatner trilogy, this is the worst. Not saying it's bad, just not my cup of tea."
5,"It's simple, but it works","We bought this book for our son when he was about six months old. Ever since, it's a lock to hold his attention. The text is brief with simple rhyming lines. The illustrations are bright and clear, but not too detailed. It doesn't really tell a story. More accurately, it highlights some key elements of train travel (whistles, the dining car, a caboose). It's a cute book, but frankly, I'm not sure I ""get"" what is so interesting to my son. Regardless, when I'm putting him to bed and we choose a book to read, he will usually reach for this one. And as any parent knows, when you find something that works, don't question it."
3,opinion of sale of mizpah coins & necklaces,"I was a little disapointed when they came in the mail - I expected them to be a little larger than they were. Maybe an ""actual size"" description would be helpful on further sales (of ?all products). Otherwise, my wife & I are happy we finally (after about 15 yrs) got them (to wear) again."
5,For my sisters',"Bought this for my sisters' birthdays'...Yes they are born on the same day, 3 years apart. They both Loved it...Thanks"
3,Turned dingy after a couple months,Turned dingy afer a couple of months and the gold color faded off the wording. Love the meaning of the neckless.
2,Not what i expected,This product is so cheaply made ...when i recieved the item the chain was all knotted up....not happy with this item at all.
4,great,Its perfect for that special one birthday graduation or just a gift for thought i love it it was a good buy for me
4,Cute,"I was VERY excited when I saw these! & it looks just like the picture. Charms are a little small & thin. But over all I am satisfied. I think maybe it is priced a little high, for the quality of the charms. Chains are very good quality.(Stainless steel) Charms are fair. (Sterling silver) I'm hoping they can be worn at all times, & don't tarnish too fast or rust."
5,lovely,"i love these chain perfect for a couple, the words are really nice from the bible as well and the length is perfect."
4,Very nice!,Came in a cute box. Shipping super fast as always. I was worried because the words were hard to read on the picture but this item is a lot nicer then I thought would for sure buy again.
3,mizpah necklace,"My teen son got this for his girlfriend for christmas. I remember them from back when i was a teen. we couldnt find them in any stores nearby. it is better looking than i imagined it would be. the one thing i would recommend is that they used closed circle jump hooks, where the clasps attach to the chains. it makes it look a bit cheap, to solder them shut would be a better look & would add to the security of the chain. overall i am happy with the purchase."
5,Awesome,"This set is so beautiful, I ordered two! My niece got one set from me to give as an anniversay gift for her and her husband to wear. I gave the other set to my brother and his longtime girlfriend as a Christmas gift. They were so happy she cried. I cannot express the quality of the set it is absolutely awesome!and well worth more than Amazons asking price. I have been thinking of ordering a third set for me and my husband. Just beautiful!"
1,Not What I Expected,"I think that the seller might have tried to make this item look as though it was worth more in value than what it actually is, by advertising that it was marked down from a very expensive price. When in actuality, it probably wasn't previously priced for more than what I paid for it. You can believe me when I say that I would never have purchased this item for more than $20.00. But, it was claimed to have been marked down from around $100.00. I bought if for close to $25.00. In my opinion, though, the item is cheap in quality. The chains are thin and feel like they're easily breakable, and the two plates are so little and thin that, instead of regular metal they feel like di-cast metal. I was thoroughly dissappointed!"
4,My dad and stepmom loved it!,I bought it for them as a Christmas present and definitely loved the quality of the metals and the length and sturdiness of the chains. It was a perfect gift the only reason I give it 4/5 stars is because I thought the halves would be a little bit bigger and heavier. Overall a quality product!
5,LOVE IT!,LOOVVEE THIS NECKLACE..IT'S JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND GREAT QUALITY. ARRIVED REALLY FAST TOO..PLANNING ON SURPRISING MY HUBBY WITH IT WHEN HE RETURNS FROM DEPLOYMENT..HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)
3,Ok but no cigar,"I realize you get what you pay for but this looks very cheaply made. The medal is smaller than a quarter when put together, I expected better."
1,This is the smallest necklace IN THE WORLD,"If I could give this zero stars I would. This Necklace was so small, my husband couldn't even read it. Also before I bought this, I didn't know it was Jewish. I am not Jewish, and neither is my husband. The Necklace was smaller than a penny. So you do the math-If a necklace is smaller than a penny,what size is the font?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?I would not get this if I were you."
3,Mizpah Medal nice,The quality is very good. Nice weight to the medal. Very attractive. Problem is that the chain is too short. One is longer than the other. I can't wear mine until I find an extension. Would give it 5 stars if the chains were long enough.
4,Beautiful,"I gave this to my long distance boyfriend for our 6 month anniversary. It is a beautiful piece of jewelry that helps keep us feeling a little closer despite the distance between us. The only problem we have had with the item... his piece of the mizpah coin came off the chain when the ring separated. We were able to find it and he used some plyers to close down that ring a little more. So before you present this to someone, you may want to check and make sure that those rings that keep the coins on the chains doesn't have an opening in it. We've both worn ours ever since we got them including showers, etc and neither of us have experienced any tarnishing or anything. So for me, it's been worth the money."
4,great!,"I absolutely loved it! It is smidge small, but definetly worth the money! Not tomention the beautiful meaning behind it."
2,disappointing,"From watching the trailers, Bear Cub appears to be a heart warming, goofy story of a party loving ""bear"" suddenly stuck with a kid to take care of. Don't be fooled - Bear Cub is, unfortunately, yet another sappy, underdeveloped, depressing gay-themed movie. The story felt extremely rushed & the character development was just plain weak. I do applaud the film for attempting to display a unique slice of life, but its delivery of the bear subculture (and of gay culture in general) was narrow, stereotypical, and borderline insulting. Similarly, the film's light treatment of the issue of AIDS was thinly explored and almost insensitive. Honestly, the only thing I enjoyed about the movie was the eye candy of the cast; there are good lookin' dudes crawling all over the place. But I need more than just good looks, beards, and flannel shirts to truly engage me in a movie. Bear Cub didn't do it for me."
3,A Decent Movie for Bear Fans,"This is a nice little film about the power of relationships and family. The movie could have been more fleshed out, with more depth to the characters, but as it stands it kind of ""breezes over"" everything. I am glad I bought it as I love Bears and the Bear culture, but honestly it's not something I'd rewatch."
3,a great movie yet a terrible american editing,"I saw this movie on its original spanish version and I saw the differences, for the american audience the edited a lot of scenes, so I'm not happy at all abo the results"
3,Decent transfer and so-so but very rare and serious bear-fetish flick,"Sometimes it lacks of focus on storytelling but it's interesting and symphatetic enough. I didn't like that its showing gay cruise areas as potential blackmail garden. I can't complain about movie and DVD throughly except very fast-paced authorized subtitles. You can't read them for God's sake! Anyway, if you bought it, you could watch it twice or thrice and catch subtitles. My favorite scene is absolutely fantastic and sexy opening scene, even if it has a body-position error. :)"
3,"Very sexy, though it might have been hairier...","Spanish film has 30-year-old gay dentist taking in his young nephew after his sister gets into legal trouble; the kid isn't particularly curious about his uncle's lifestyle, but the grandmother wants him out of the house anyway. After a sexy opening scene (which puzzlingly has little to do with the rest of the picture), this light drama settles into a disappointingly formulaic pattern. The dentist and his stocky, hairy friends have a happy-go-lucky rapport which is infectious, but there's not enough of them (one deleted sequence with the gang hanging out should've been part of the theatrical release). The dentist's health woes and the boy's guardian problems are sketchy (at best), and, after the opening scene, the homosexual content seems to get a bit timid. More insight in this man's lifestyle and the friends who love and support him would've made this a more satisfying film. B-"
4,"BEAR CUB is Good, but US did produce the first BEAR movi","BEAR CUB is a really wonderful film, but to respond to Jeffrey of Ill., there was a ""bear"" film made in 2003 called ""A BEAR'S STORY"". It is a short. It has been playing in film festivals all around the world for the past 2 years, but has not been released on DVD as of yet. It is a contempory coming-of-fur story about a man who discovers the bear community after not fitting into the ""gay lifestyle"" that is so prevalent. I truly hope you get to see it in some film fest someday or hopefully catch it on DVD when it finally is released. It has won a few festival awards. It will play next in August 2005 at the first Vermont Bear Film Festival and then this fall in Norway. You can check out the web site for news on showings www.abearsstory.com. Until then buy BEAR CUB and enjoy. Why do I know so much about ""A BEAR'S STORY""? I am one of the leads. Hope you like it."
1,This is censored!,"I very much resent the MPAA telling me what I can watch and what I can't...look for the not rated version if you want the movie like it was made, and it is much better uncensored!"
5,"A heart-wrenching, FABULOUS story for a first time author","As the sister of a female police officer and the Mother of a 7-year old son, this story tugged at my heart as well as making me swell with pride and compassion for all police officers dealing with gang members. Sherrie Board couldn't have done a better job authoring this sad but true story of the struggle(s) our probation and police officers face on a day-to-day basis. I highly recommend this good book to anyone who likes a good mystery read."
2,Where's the Mystery?,"I was very excited to start this book, but quickly lost interest, as the plot was weak, the writing was poor, and the editing abysmal! The premise was strong, but got lost in the poor writing. Better luck next time."
2,Walking Between the Worlds: The Science of Compassion,I like Greg Braden bit his other books are more interesting. I don't remember the titles now as this is a stressful time and nothing stays in my mind.
3,Some Good Points,"The relationship and knowledge transmitted from the essenes is refreshing. This is much better than his last book, Zero Point, which was supported a zany apololyptic ttheory with little evidence. Here there is a much softer feel and stronger message, though I'm a bit puzzled how compassion can be or is a science Read LightShift 2000 by Ken Kalb if you would like to see the ideals to of compassion brilliantly put into action."
4,Beautiful ideas. Terrible grammar and sentence construction,"The author appears sensitive, intelligent, caring and pretty sensible. Probably an excellent counselor. I consider the book very good to excellent. The wretched grammar and often unclear sentence structure are disconserting, to say the least. The attractive format certainly gives no clue to the very, very poor editing."
1,This is not Key West the Band from Texas,Don't be fooled ! I thought I was ordering music from Key West the Band from Texas. I don't know what this is but it's not the same group.Americana is the Key West the Band CD that is so good.Don't waste your money on this one.They are imposters.
2,Sucessful Scrap Quilts,The book does not have that many interesting patterns in it. It's really difficult to tell if you want a book by looking at the cover. Not a recommendation
5,Superbly developed and presented reference resource.,"Quality multimedia materials are reviewed and recommended in Irene Wood's Culturally Diverse Videos, Audios & Cd-roms For Children And Young Adults, which uses the input from experienced libraries to compile a listing of recommendations for particular ethnic groups. Over 900 titles cover African, Asian, Latino and other groups, with listings grouped by audience and then subcategories of subjects. Highly recommended."
5,LAND YOUR MAN!,"Humorous story of the girl next door (Brenda) who's been deeply in love with her stubborn but good looking neighbor (Fletcher) for years only Fletcher seems immune to his childhood friends' little sister!Not to mention the fact he's about to marry someone else! Poor Brenda. No poor Fletcher! His girlfriend, the gorgeous witch/bimbo/medusa (Dominque) issued an ultimatum -- marry her in 7 days or else! So the reluctant Fletcher agrees.How to stop the wedding...mmm...Bren only has a week -- fortunatly for her she's given a copy of the much useful guide LAND YOUR MAN!Will it work!"
2,Nice looking but innapropriate for beginners,"These knieves look nice and are made of quality metal but are much harder to throw.If you read Rip Thorn's book you will not his suggestion that one learns and practices with a 9 inch long blade.This is very true.Unfortunately the seller scalps you on the shipping charges so that returning the merchandise becomes too costly.So now I am stuck with these. Overall, unless you are a collector (then you would not neeed 3 units) do not by them"
4,Young girl makes first modern discovery of cave paintings,"A true story of a young Spanish girl who discovered ancient cave paintings in the 1800's. The scientific community of the time ridiculed the idea. Later her findings were authenticated. Brings history into perspective. This book has been used successfully as source material in first through third grades, both multi-age and traditional."
2,GAME OVER!,My son enjoyed this toy for about 15 min. Then he wanted the water to go a little higher. He turned it up and the tube busted. GAME OVER!
4,"Greatful Dead-Dick's Picks,Volume 6:Hartford,CT on 10/14/83","Very nice archive live recording of a gig the band played at the Hartford Civic Center.It was assembled by tape archivist Dick Latvala.I've never really been THAT big of a Dead fan,but I've always enjoyed Jerry Garcia's(R.I.P.) guitar playing.The tunes I liked the best on this 3-CD release are ""Althea"",""Fire On The Mountain"",and the rocking ""The Other One"".The lengthy tracks ""Eyes Of The World"" and ""Scarlet Begonias"" are very well played as is Mickey Hart's drum solo at the start of disc three.Other notable cuts are ""Alabama Getaway"",""C.C.Rider"",""Keep your Day Job"" and the encore ""U.S.Blues"".The original 'jam band' is hard at work as one can truly experience here.Would make a swell gift for any Deadhead that doesn't already own a copy."
3,Massive disc 2,"This is probably the weakest release of the series, but, in true GD fashion, still worth getting. Disc 2 is where its all at; with an hour of utterly spellbinding music. The first set is more or less a trainwreck, showcasing the worst Dead vocals I think I've ever heard, although the playing could be nice at times. But the second set is a different story, with a Scarlet>Fire>Estimated>Eyes sequence that will knock you silly...post-drums is solid...but you seriously need to hear that second disc."
3,A show only a DeadHead could love...,"If you want to hear just how bad the Grateful Dead could Suck - the first track of this set is a great place to start. It takes two full (and totally flubbed) verses for Garcia to even start sounding coherent. However - once Garcia becomes concious, they start really cooking! (It's an amazing study in contrast.) If you're totally zoned out the 2nd set to this is a good way to go wandering, but overall it's blustery and never really gets going. If you're a fan of ""Ragged, but Right"" Grateful Dead Music - then this is your show! Steve Urbauer Stephen Urbauer"
4,excellent second set,The first set is great-sometimes the quality is a little hairy.But it is truly cd 2 which stands above them all.Scarlet>Fire>Estimated>Eyes all told this sequence lasts just over 45 minutes.A rarity for Dick's Picks because it is from the 80's=some nice Brent action
2,don't let disc 2 fool you,"I bought this for the Scarlet>Fire and that's all that I found of value. Disc 1 is lazy and sloppy and Disc 3 isn't much better. Disc 2 is outstanding, but everything else can be found elsewhere and in better versions. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,"Lots of Information, Tough Read","This book is a thorough study of the warfare of this age. It includes good information on the psychological state of the combatants and the development of different tactics throughout the time period. Much effort is spent dissecting the different uses of knights and foot troops with descriptions of battles as support. I read a lot of military history, but this book is a tough read. It is more like a reference work than anything else and the organzition within the chapters could be better. I recommend this only to the most ardent history buffs."
5,The perfect gift,"I love giving children's books as gifts but I hate shopping for them. After hours of picking through all the fluff and inanities, I always settle on something mediocre because I just can't bear to continue looking. Finding the SNU books by Brook was such a relief (like the time I found Stellaluna by Janell Cannon). ""How to Catch a SNU"" captured me and all the kids I know (Gift-giving has been easy since discovering the SNUS). I hope Brook is busy writing more SNU adventures. The only thing wrong with the series is there aren't enough of them."
3,"Mixed Overall, But A Few Gems Make It Worth The Price","Okay, now we've got the ""Tracks"" collection to fill the Springsteen void, but after you've gotten a little tired of that and are looking for something fresh (since it will probably take another 5 years for him to assemble his next collection from the vaults), this is well worth picking up (for Springsteen fans anyway). With a little programming of your CD player, there's one solid CD worth of great material. John Wesley Harding's version of Jackson Cage alone makes it worth having (absolutely phenomenal, gave me a whole new appreciation of the song). Don't overthink it, just get it and enjoy. You might even get a few of your ""anti-Springsteen"" friends to appreciate his songwriting."
2,Too trashy,Did not like. Did not enjoy. Did not finish the book. Which I never brought the book. The book was disgusting. Very disappointed in the author.
2,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed when I read this book. I like Mary Monroe but this book wasn't ""exciting"". I wasn't into the ""wives"" theme and I got sick and tired of going from one character to the other. Then to top it off none of the characters had a good ending. I will say this IF you are interested in being a ""call girl"" then you need to read this book because it will show you how the street life leads to NOTHING. All the women had bad past and began nowhere and basically ended up right back at square one. I won't give up on Mary but this one you can save your money on!"
4,He's just a Playa- Playa!,"WARNING: You have to really pay attention while reading this book because it's a tale of different women but, it all comes ful circle. Mary wrote this book as if she knew this women...yes it's that good! If you are a fan of her work this will not dissapoint even if your not it won't. It keeps you wanting to know what will happen next. Looking for a good read? Pick this one up!"
3,"For the most part, I enjoyed this book, but...","I actually did enjoy this book. I think the author does an excellent job at weaving the lives of the characters together, and painting a vivid picture for us of what's actually going on.The downfall of this book, and the reason why I only gave it 3 stars, is that I think the author tries a little TOO hard. She often tries to pour too many deep subjects and heavy material in at once, and it gets to be overkill. She could've ligthened up a bit on some characters, and let us into others a bit more.Overall, it's a good book and a pretty good read."
1,Too Many Unbelievable Characters,"Mary Monroe's Red Light Wives was not of the caliber with The Upper Room. I know that characters must make some bad choices in order to cause some conflict, but in this tale, all of the characters make bad choice after bad choice - to the point that they were unbelievable. It seemed like Ms. Monroe wanted the reader to see a softer side to Clyde because of the way he felt about his daughter, but he, again, came off unbelievable. In addition, Helen's character, did not seem like a real person. It must have been difficult as an author to get inside the head of someone who was supposed to be mentally retarded. Instead, Helen came off, not as mentally challenged because her thought process was too organized. Instead, she came off as a very naive adolescent."
3,Red Light/Green Light,"Sometimes doing what you have to do for survival isn't always worth it. This was recommended with the novel, ""The Million $ Divorce."" It was an okay read but I remember several years ago reading a book by this author called The Upper Room and I remember really liking that novel. But this one is not nearly as good."
4,very different,I have been a fan of Ms.Monroe's books and I must say I enjoyed this book immensely. I love the way she weaves the charatecers into the story and the most memorable for me would be Helen. While she is not glorifying or putting down one of the oldest professions in the world she does show us the ups and downs of the women who choose this life for whateever reason. I highly recommend this book...definite page turner.
2,Not Vintage Mary Monroe!,"Dull, dull, & duller! I've been a huge Mary Monroe fan since forever, but I was very dissapointed with this book. I kept reading, just waiting for the excitement to begin, then I realized that I was already past Page 200! No great laughs, no steamy moments, this book simply missed the mark completely."
3,Red Light Wives,I normally LOVE Mary Monroe's books but this was different. This book was ok but it was my least favorite of Ms. Monroe books that I read. Would I pay almost $5 if I knew the way it would be? Probably not! That made a bit upset.
5,Felt like a roller coaster ride!,This book was great and wonderfully written! It had so many twists and turns but everything came together and all added up throughout the book! This is a must read !!!
1,Not the One,"I bought this because we have well water & I thought that this may be one of the reasons my hair is so dry. This stuff is awful. It smells bad & when I used the shampoo and then rinsed it out, it made my hair feel like a haystack. After using the conditioner, it didn't make it too much better feeling. When drying my hair, I did not notice any difference in my hair's texture & it certainly didn't help make it soft, shiney or manageable. I will not be buying this again."
5,Sweet and satisfying,"This is a really sweet, well written and ultimately satisfying story. I'm excited to discover the gifted Alexis Harrington and I would put her among the top romance writers. The story did seem a little slow at first but it is worth sticking to it."
3,ending is laughable,"The book starts off well enough, Jeff a former sheriff who seems to have turned into the town drunk is ordered to work for Allie, one of two sisters who need serious help with repairs to their home after he is caught stealing an egg. Allie is a sweet girl but her sister Olivia is something else. She's a spoiled brat who wants no man near her sister because after all who's going to take care of her and be her maid. Anyhow, the attraction is there between Jeff and Allie, that's all good, love it so far... but when Jeff gets arrested it goes downhill from there. There is a judge and jury who seem to think he's guilty as several stupid lies are believed. But really..... The evidence to exonerate him is weak at best and while I don't want to say too much (I may have already) but the way/reason he got off was laughable. Read it and ask yourself... Who does that?"
4,Another good one!,"Allie's Moon is the 7th book I've read by Alexis Harrington. Fewer spelling & grammar mistakes than some of the others I have read on my Kindle. If you like Alexis Harrington books, you'll enjoy this one too."
3,A pleasant read,"I found this novel to be pleasant to read - a good way to spend a chilly January Sunday. But first, the author could use a proof reader - there are several missing words. Second, she needs to bone up a bit more on historical settings - for example, how do two sisters, with no livestock of their own, a weekly grocery order with no refridgeration, and limited funds manage to have fresh meat to eat every day? She did much better with other details, like knowing a pick from an axe, and a plow from a seeder.I will probably try a few more of her offerings."
3,"Interesting plot and characters, but needs editing","This was a good story, and since this is my third Harrington read, I can say that it, like the previous two, has an interesting premise and intriguing characters. Both Jeff and Allie come with significant emotional baggage, and you will feel compassion for the pain that they each suffer.I won't go into a synopsis, since that is offered by multiple other reviewers. My main criticism of this book is that Harrington could have restrained herself in how often she described her characters' romantic/sexual appeal to the other. She seems quite fixated on Allie's ""glossy"" ""mohogany"" ""silky"" and ""shining"" curls - ad nauseum... a la Harlequin, if that's what you like.The story really could have stood either further character development, or an overall shortening of length, cutting the overly repetitive physical descriptions. Otherwise, it was a good, lightweight read."
4,Integrated Accounting 3e by Klooster & Allen,"An excellent textbook for learing the basics of computerized accounting. Very well presented, starting with an overview of chart of account layout, AR/AP, Payroll, Partnerships & Corporations. The last chapter on setting up a complete accountig system is really nice. I am using for self study & find the book easy to follow. This is set up with college level 2 reading level assumed. This is the text currently being used by a local college for their course. Very well worth the full price of the product."
1,Poor Service All the Way Around!,"First of all, it took 2 weeks to get to me. Secondly, they sent the wrong book. Third, when I received the correct book, it did not have the CDRom with it. Fourth, I've emailed them about the missing CDRom, and I haven't received a response. What is going on?"
3,integrated Accounting version 3,"integrated Accounting Rooster & Allen V 3compterized Accounting with quickbooks pro 2000- Hornethe conscious Reader 8 edition by shrodes, FinestoneThe bedford Handbook 5 edition by Diana HackerEconomics 1"
1,did anyone else actually read this??,"Yes, the art pictured in this book is fantastic. It shows some works that are nearly impossible to find in any other publication. However, the writing is simply horrible. The author's style is one of simple name-dropping without substance. If you are interested in reading a long-winded who's who list of artists, composers, choreographers, cinematographers, authors, and scenesters active in the early 20th century, this book is for you. If, however, you want to know more than names, read something else. ...but, again, the illustrations ARE great."
3,stone keeps falling out,"I loved these when I bought them in February 2009, but sooner or later I will have to quit wearing them because I will loose the stone for good. The stone looks and feels secure, but when I least expect it, it drops out."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"Simple and extremely easy to use. Simple plug it in and use it. It is recognized by my laptop very easily and is lightweight and able to hold up to throwing it into a pile of other cords and connections for my computer. Lightweight as well, so it's nice for the travel case."
3,Wonderful Hiccup,"There is little text to speak of, mostly plates really, which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that it's so small, so skinny... there's just not enough to the book and it would have made better sense to me if it had been combined with its two other sister books as one complete volume so this is more like a hiccup than a book but, for what is there, the pages are beautiful."
4,"It talks, but not with NOTES","I purchased this product so I could download calendar entries into my Motorola L2 phone. Second use is to upload pix from my daughter's L6.Warning - any Voice Name training you have done will be lost if you replace the addressbook with a download.The communication (calendar w Outlook or for pictures) works fine with a PC at home. When I installed the product on my notebook at work, I found that it offered to link with Lotus Notes, which my company uses for email and calendaring. The calendar function does not work but that is probably because my company (large corporation) has modified the Notes system. The addressbook would have worked but I do not store cell phones in my Notes account."
5,Phone Tools,I have been in possession of this item for several weeks now and the product works great. I am very pleased.
1,Not worth what I paid......,....And I only paid $0.01. It does not read my phone though it specifically states that my model is compatable. Buyer beware. I'd give it a zero if I could. It seems pretty stupid to have to give a star to a product that does not work at all.
2,Weird,"This seemed like a great deal and it probably would have been, had I actually received the right cable. It says it supports my phone, but note that 2 different cables are pictured. I only received one, and it was not one that plugged into my phone. I returned it and did not try to re-order."
4,Works Great.,"You can use pretty much any USB cable for the RAZR, but this package is worth buying for the software."
3,Motorola PhoneTools 4.0,"Good vendor- had to use their ""no-hassle"" return policy as the CD arrived damaged. Prompt e-mail notification and product replacement. Really was no hassle.Below average product- Haven't been able to get it working on Vista; had to load it onto Win98 machine. Doesn't provide the functionality I thought it would. Disappointing, Motorola."
1,Comes with Superman?,Wait? Is this $400 for some kids sheets and pillowcases or does Superman also do a flyover and come make the bed?
1,Are you kidding?,$399 for a set of children's sheets? Have you all gone mad? Nuts! Does he come and sleep over night?
3,Its ok,"I wanted this to be better than it was. The back window would only stay when we stuck it in there using tools from home. It would not stay at all. The side windows worked well. It is not too dark, which does not help enough in the direct sunlight, but it is also a perk to keep your child entertained as they still have the ability to look out the window. I would not buy it again, but it does get the job done and I am still using on the back window to keep the sun out of the car and off the kids."
4,Great,Comes with two profile shades (I didn't know that). They block the sun and cover almost the entire window--this was the best part. I hate those square pull down shades that only block half the sun from your baby's face. The only down side of course is that a person can't roll these up to let the window down...you have to take it off to roll the window down.
2,doesn't really do much,"It's arguable that this shade does anything. My daughter still squints and cry that it's too bright. Suction cups work well if it's not defective. One of mine arrived folded so it would not suction. It's a hassle to return. Oh yeah, don't get it through Autobarn. You'll have to pay return shipping if you get a bad one."
1,Doesnt fit all windows,It doesnt fit all type of windows. I have an optima and has to give it to somebody who had a Camry.
5,Auto shade,The auto shade that I ordered was exactly what I have been looking for. It covers most of the side windows and you can still see out. Thanks for items. I will pass this buy at Amazon to my friends.
4,Who the F are the arctic monkeys,"A single/EP with some good b-sides. I agree with other reviewers who said it's thrown together to take advantage of the Arctic Monkeys popularity, but these guys are so talented that even their mediocre stuff is good - better than 90% of what's out there right now. Worth a listen, but I would not pay the import price for it now that I've heard it. One thing that sets this group above the crowd is their lyrics - clever, thoughtful, original.This collection is no exception."
5,Absolute Classic,"While this song never had as much impact as their previous hit, ""Fight For Your Right To Party"", this is still one of the most innovative Beastie Boys songs ever. The way samples are used in this one is brilliant, The Dust Brothers, the production crew behind this one, samples everything and anything they could get their hands on. Not to mention the Beastie Boys' trademark tag-team rhyming. Classic single."
5,"Excellently crafted, tremendous poise and eloquent beauty","I give this stunning Russian album 5 stars. The accuracy, thoughtfullness, attentiveness, and care given to each note is immaculate. It is beautiful and very well done. I'd recommend this to any pianist, floutist, or general music-lover. It is a hard act to follow."
3,Lacked Depth,"I would have really enjoyed this story if storylines were started and then not finished. Characters were then introducted, but later disappeared. I didn't get any real feel for the characters because they lacked depth. It took me a while to get into the story. I almost didn't finish it, but I like to finish what I start."
1,Did I just get a 'bad' copy?,"I wish I could say that I think I got a book full of misprints because the story I read seemed unfinished. I don't usually fill in this kind of survey-review, but I have to speak out on this book."
3,The sexy box sold me...,This is OK. Above average at best.The writing relies heavily on one's understanding of Japan's history and culture. The politics and ignorant masses really appeals to those who like to watch the news... or you're typical blue collar worker... but for me... It didn't quite hit the bulls eye.Not quite what I had hoped for... (I wasn't expecting Hentai... but I had hoped for better character development.)
3,Kind of a let down,"At first I was excited about this since first seeing the previews from Noir and Rurouni Kenshin I think. It was something I always wanted to see. Then I started watching it and it kind of let me down. It doesn't develop like most stories, almost being too slow. The short-length episodes don't help much either. It just loses your attention too fast and you get bored.I'm really sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this to first time anime fans. It's alright to have it in your collection, but it might just sit there collecting dust like my Shura no Toki and Sakura Taisen collections."
3,"Good scenery, bad bike simulation!","I bought this as a gift for my wife who frequently uses a bike trainer. I am from Washington state but no longer live there. This DVD was a little nostalgic and brought back wonderful memories of the places and scenery. The DVD is great scenery and is great for showing off the beauty of the state to those who have never been.The trips are filmed in a car and follow routes used by cars. Frequent pullovers and sideshots of scenic views are made. All of this is nice but it takes away from the realism of riding a bike. It would have been better if it had been filmed using a helmet camera by someone on an actual bicycle. I am not rating the soundtrack because my wife didn't like the music that accompanied it, so I just had it on mute with my own music playing. Overall, it is a nice distraction while on a bike trainer, but I would prefer a little more realism."
5,My favorite trance song,"Back in the day, Robert Miles put out some of the best trance music I had heard in the late '90s. Unfortunately his music took a downturn with ""Organik"" and turned me off his music. His debut album ""Dreamland"" remains a classic with me though. One of my favorite songs off the album is the gorgeous ""One and One"" with vocals provided by Maria Nayler. I first bought the single to ""One and One"" before I bought ""Dreamland"" after hearing the song on a radio station on a car trip with some college friends to a mall in Illinois. I liked the first single ""Children"" but it wasn't until ""One and One"" that made me a fan. I just love Maria Nayler's vocals. Her delicate vocals were ideal for this gorgeous trance song. ""One and One"" is 4 minutes of pure bliss. Still one of my favorite dance songs from the late '90s."
2,candy,"Did not like the taste of this candy. It was ceramy but tooooooo sweet andthe maple taste was over powering, which made it have a slight bitter taste."
3,ok,"this movie was ok to me i found myself kinda doin other things then watchin the movie like talkin on the phone and texting and stuff like that, a few parts caught my attention but thats about it i give this movie a 3."
3,Okay but in comparison,I have read the other Crimson City books and I have to say I was a little disappointed in this storyline. This gives a glimpse into the Demon lifestyle but I felt that the characters were a little flat in terms of their backstory and why everything worked together. The book was an okay read but in comparison to the other Crimson City titles this one falls a little flat but it's still worth the read to continue Ms. O'Shea's story. I have hopes for more installments with more to the story as time goes on.
3,The turning of the series,"This segment of the Crimson City series features demons instead of vamps and weres. There isn't much political, demon info, etc to support the story. As a supernatural book, it gets three stars. There isn't enough supporting structure or other things happening. However, this book does have a look of items that those more interested in ""romance"" will find right up their alley. It is probably the best book of the series for purist romance readers. It was just to much ""destined to be together"" gratuitous sexual language and touchy feely for my taste. OK. I admit it, some times the sexual teasing on the part of the female protagonist was pretty funny. This might be the turning of the series into something a bit more traditional."
2,"Understanding Cultural Differences: Germans, French, and Americans","An interesting book, but poorly written. Observations were useful but the book is so repetitious and muddled, it was hard to stay focused on it. Most of the source material was self-referential and seemingly based on surveys done in the 1980s. Worth a read, but keep expectations in check."
1,Stereotypes written down,"After having read ""The silent language"" by Edward Hall I am very disappointed of ""Understanding cultural differences"". I would love to know where exactly the authors got their information from. They certainly haven't lived in any European country long enough to really get acquainted with cultural differences. The book contains so much negative information about Germany (my home country) and France (where I lived for a long time before moving to the U.S.) that has so little to do with reality that it's almost funny.Those stereotypes in a written form are rather dangerous and hardly offer adequate preparation for anyone who plans to travel to Germany or France on business or even live there."
4,Pretty Sweet,"This book is great for anyone who is into CryptoZoology, and I mean people who are HARDCORE into it, and don't want to hear about the same old bigfoot, Aliens, and Chupacobra stories, I have to say every single one of the creatures in this book I have never heard of, it is truly great. Only problem is the author gets way into things, and explains things you really dont care about, like the mongolian deathworm section, he goes on comparing it to different lizards. Other than that, it is a great buy, and I would suggest it for anyone who is into the paranormalA 4...out of 5."
2,by far the weakest of Shuker's works,"I have quite the cryptozoological library and, moreover, a fair selection of Dr. Shuker's books. I was terribly, bitterly disappointed in this entry. I should have known something was afoot when, scanning the list of original sources, I found papers and columns from twelve-year-old magazines. In this book, Dr. Shuker does not review meaningful mysteries with substantive backing by trustworthy people, but (mostly) ridiculous reports of man-eating trees and such from uneducated Neolithic tribesmen whose ""references"" often amount to six generations' worth of heard-it-from-my-father. Do not waste your money on this compendium of the ridiculous from an otherwise laudable and trustworthy scientist who, for some reason (the money?), cobbled together his weakest material and slapped on a hastily sketched cover."
1,dimensions and material made out of please!!!!,"Needs more description, i.e., 24 inches high, wrought iron, etc.Are we supposed to guess and cross our fingers???"
3,"Love it, but i'm on my second one","I love this strainer, but I'm on my second one because the handle on the first one snapped off. Hopefully that was just a one time thing! It's great if you have limited storage space since it collapses."
1,Did not work :(,This is the 5th remote I've bought for my Emerson flat screen TV. It did not work even though it says works on all Emerson TVs since 2001.
1,Don't believe it!!!!,This product would not operate any Emersom TV (2) I own. It cost so much to return it wasn't worth more expense. Maybe I find someone to give it to if it works for them.No more purchases without prepaid return lable.
1,Garbage,wprked fine for first few hours then it stopped working on a regular basis. Had to keep hitting buttons to try to get it to work most functions now I get nothing out of it including sound and power save your money
1,Do you believe in miracles? Not after wasting my money on this!,"Had an older Sylvania tv with no remote. I couldn't switch to the inputsto play games on it so I gave this a try. The instructions seemed easyenough but it never synchronized with my TV. The description should haveALL TV models that are known to work with the remote, not just a blanketstatement of its capabilities."
1,Didn't work,Too many different manufacture dates ( 3 to be exact) . Says one thing on outside of the package and something TOTALLY different inside the package. Your best bet is if your tv was manufactured before 2002 then just get a new tv and don't waste your time looking for a remnote including this one. I am really annoyed right now. Hopefully when I call customer service I won't be and I can get online and say that all is well and that I will be getting a FULL REFUND including shipping. If not then I will not change my rating of this company's remote. I just hate to be out of money for something I feel had misleading information on it.
1,not easy in the longrun,"I got this remote in 2009, by the years end it had stopped working properly.First the up and down channel buttons went out ( that is they go up 4-6 channels and then down 3-4, so you never know where you will end up).OK I can manage around that just put in the numbers, but now as of 2010, numbers 5,6,7,9, do not register , so you go to a channel down or up from the one you want and then hope you can get to the channel by using the up and down channel buttons- get the picture, it is channel roulette."
3,great remote,after a while it quit working and the seller would not replace it i would not recommend buying one they only work a few weeks not worth the money
2,Didnt Work,Bought this remote after thoroughly checking to be sure the model number on my TV was one of the ones listed for the remote. Upon receipt of remote I tried programming it every way the instructions provided but to no avail as only the On/Off or volume or channel buttons would work (but never together after the final programming step). Sent back to company promptly for a full refund.
1,Do not Buy,Do not buy this product-bought one & on the second day the power button stopped working. It's not worth sending back-probably cost me more to mail it back than the item is even worth!!! Very disappointed !!!
1,Sylvania TV,"It does Not work. At first I thought I put the batteries in wrong, so I switched them around. It still did Not work> I checked the TV to make sure that it was comparable and it still did Not work"
3,great book for a select audience,"Mr. Pontius has written a book that inspires, uplifts, and teaches; it's main drawback is that it is aimed at such a limited audience (LDS, or ""Mormon"" people) that it will have only limited appeal, I'm afraid. Having stipulated that, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed it; it is better written than the average ""LDS Fiction:"" good plot, fair characterizations, teaches truth. I will definitely recommend it to my children and friends."
1,name doesn't mean quality,"I purchased this a little over a year ago new, the upside of this machine is the scanning quality is great, and you hardly ever run out of ink......You never run out of ink because you can never get it to WORK!!!I was able to use the fax machine one (1!!) time before it stopped working. As far as the printing goes, WHEN you can get it to work, it prints well, not fast, but the quality is okay. After awhile the printer stopped working. The paper constantly jams in it so if you have alot of time on your hands and don't mind frustration and like to tinker with things, then this is the product for you! I on the other hand think it belongs in the rubbish bin!"
1,Not the product pictured,"I recieved this item and it was not the item that is pictured. It is a different bottle with a plastic top and does not smell like the original fragrance, therefore leading me to believe it is an imitation. There was no way to return the product either."
5,Sweet Memories,This cd is one of those that when you see the video on t.v. it makes you want to pop it in and listen to it. It's one that makes you want to dance.
3,Partly Boring!,"This is not one of my favorite Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes. People would give excuses that since it is a late film Jeremy Brett didn't act good when he was sick. The plot and directing (filming) is just boring. Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke are fine it it. It it about a racing horse who only a couple of people know he is being raced. At the end they find a dead body, from a couple of days ago hidden. This is definately not one of the best!"
4,Seiko,I gifted this watch to my dad. He still has it and loves it. It does a great job! I think it deffinitely is woth your money.
5,A Must Buy,"Excellant book, well written. Conveys core ideas succinctly. Uses modern spellings. This book has chapters on 7 Confucian masters: (1) Kongzi (Confucius), (2) Mengzi (Mencius), (3) Xunzi (Hsun Tzu), (4) Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi), (5) Wang Yangming, (6) Yan Yuan, and (7) Dai Zhen. Then there is a four page long conclusion where he discusses different models of self cultivation. A thoughtful and educational book. There are many aspects of Confucianism, but this book focuses on self-cultivation. It was enlightening and stimulating, yet kind of academic. For a more practical view of how Confucianism can be applied in your life, see ""Achieve Lasting Happiness, Timeless Secrets to Transform Your Life"" by Robert Canright."
5,Great book for artist,This great book is by Thomas Kinkade. My wife does Oil/Acrylic/Watercolor painting. She loved this book. It gave her idea about lightings in the painting and it helped her to practice them while painting.
1,Not All Regions,I saw part one of this on YouTube and enjoyed it. Was surprised it was available as an all region DVD. It's not. My one star is for Amazon listing it improperly and not the documentary itself.
1,Not as advertised,"This watch was very pretty, but that was the only good thing about it. The watch is advertised as water resistant to 30m, but it is not. It does not have ""water resistant"" inscribed on the back and upon contacting Seiko, I was told that this model isn't water resistant. The warranty card that comes with the watch must be completely filled out by the dealer or it is invalid, and the card had not been filled out so the warranty advertised does not exist. There were several small scratches on the face of the watch when I received it, and worst of all, the watch would not keep time. It lost nearly five minutes a day for each day I had it. I have since sent the watch back and am waiting to see if the company that sold it's service is any better than their product."
4,This is not your typical Bollywood movie,"The typical Bollywood movie is a love story with lots of singing and dancing.""Don 2"" is more like a James Bond movie with non-stop action, except in this movie the star of the show is a master criminal.Sharukh Khan stars in two of my favorite Bollywood movies: ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" and ""Chak de India."" Sharukhn Khan does a credible job in ""Don 2"" as a slight crazy psychotic criminal mastermind who is always one or two steps ahead of the police and his fellow criminals.If you enjoy action movies give ""Don 2"" a try. The action never stops."
