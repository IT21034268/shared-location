2,Not p to the standards one would expect from Apple's OSx,"I pre-ordered Leopard and received it on its release day. It does have some bugs.It does not recognize my music keyboard, it does not let me edit contacts in my address book, and for sure it has other bugs I did not yet discover.I'm a ""converted"" guy, so I am totally in love with my MacBook Pro but I must say that overall I'm disappointed in this Mac OSx.I had to buy a USB enclosure ($29.99), put a hard drive in it (I already had it), and re-install the Tiger 0.4.10 OSx (the previous version) to have it recognize my music keyboard and eventually edit my contacts.To those considering buying it I say ""wait until the 11.0 version is released, by then most of the bugs should be resolved."
4,Mac OS 10.5,"Overall, I am really impressed. I had a few issues during installation, but am really glad I upgraded. Love all the new features and the ""look"" of Leopard."
5,A lot of new useful futures.,"It is really worth to upgrade. A lot of new futures such as time machine (backup), and space.I really love the space. It really help a lot for users who does multiple task same time.Also new backup (time machine) is very each to setup, and works great."
5,Beauty and functionality on steroids!,"I installed Leopard on both a G4 iMac and a dual core MacBook Pro. Installation was without problem, except that printer drivers needed to be reinstalled on both machines. However, reinstalling these was a breeze with the system's new printing software. Leopard is pure elegance. But it is not just a pretty face. It has extraordinary functionality, speed, and stability."
4,Ultima Vista is Leopard,"For those of you who may be reluctant to buy an upgrade for over one hunded dollars, I tell this ain't some broken windows or locked gates, even if you don't have the latest intel dual core, there are many features and upgraded ideas that prove that apple was the first personal computer, and MS is a failure of innovation, customer response, and non monopoly ideas. What makes this so much better than an XP to Vista robbery, is that even regular OS actions are smoother, more refined, and the little things make a greater-than-the-sum-of -its-parts upgrade. Go 10.5 for better peripheral integration, cross platform compatibility, and spaces, time machine, and preview just prove the most technically hot OS is still the best GUI in front of an open standard and much more than Bill could steal in the 80's and 90's. The one to beat- and iLIfe and iWork 08 make it a route!! Dig in."
3,Ho chi mama!,"If'n it aint broke, why try to fix it. 10.5 is alright, but iMovie's newest version 8 sucks. Version six is where they should have stopped possibly adding a little here and there through the years. David Pogue's book on the subject helps as bedtime reading, but I'm sticking version six until Apple can convince me they are coming out with a version 6.75 Bobtail."
1,Buggy Leopard!,"Loaded fine for others here and there but I should've waited: it crashes on the RSS FEEDS SCREENSAVER and won't run Photoshop.The average novice or casual user will follow the simple prompts, but consult an expert first! The promises of easy back-ups and colorful add-ons (Safari, I'll admit, is a lot cooler) can't restore what just won't run right... and I keep a tidy Mac.Slowed down my eMac to an unbelievably crawl. Reinstalled with an archive, but no change.Nice overall look and nice features... IF they work for you, but ""Dr Mac"" Bob Levitus advises to wait; you'd better listen. I can't get ANY help on fixes and Apple's forum is really a long list of people begging for help.Love Apple, but..."
1,Horrible poorly conceived product,"Leopard, Apples new operating system for the Mac platform is a terrible waste of time and money unless you own an Intel Mac. On a G5 desktop it is full of bugs and crashes constantly. Worst product ever from Apple. Do not buy this if your Mac is not Intel. My machine is now in shambles and Apple's tech support is terrible. Buyer beware!!"
3,upgrading,"buying Leopard was easy. saved a little money too, so that's always nice. upgrading to Leopard... why does it have to take up so much memory!!!! it's not that different enough from my old OS, but takes up so many Gigs! i was on 10.2 before the upgrade. oh well, it's done now."
3,"Not for the imac, bought in 2003",I bought a new Ipod Nano and to my surprise was not compatable with my imac! A rep from Apple suggested the upgrade to Leopard and the upgrade would not take to my imac. Again I contacted Apple and this time they said I would have to buy a new Mac. I just returned the Leopard since it was not compatable. Will not buy a new mac--yet.
4,Great operating system,"This operating system is a great upgrade. I upgraded from 10.3 (Panther) to 10.5 (Leopard) so the influx of new features was large. Shortly after installing 10.5.0, Apple released 10.5.1 to fix some of the bugs that were present; a few bugs persist but the overall experience has been very good.Some of the new features I now use continually are the stacks in the Dock and spaces for keeping my workflows separate. The improvements of Spotlight make searches very thorough and fast."
2,think before ya speak and look before ya leap,Dont even think about the shift till there is a faster more stable and more COMPATIBLE(for pro audio applications and drivers) is available...
1,installation blue screened,"The installation blue screened for me. As Apple suggested, I deleted ApplicationEnhancer.bundle in single-user mode and it still blue screened. Apple claims page 7 of the documentation that came with the Leopard DVD gives an alternate method of installing but that's not what's on page 7 of my documentation. It just doesn't work. Fortunately, I have a CopyCatX backup of the previous operating system that I can restore."
2,Not enough stuff,"There is something really exciting about getting your computer on the cutting edge with new software...but leopard was a big disappointment...for starters, it took forever to download, and even though I had no problems with it at all, it just took soooo looooong! To top it off, it did not even come with some of the basic stuff, like: Excel, Word, links to You Tube etc. I was a little disappointed, but since it was given to me as a gift...it is hard to give it one star."
1,Mac OS X Version 10.5.4 Leopard,"The necessity for this product on 4+ year old MACs seems to be Bill Gates' retirement parting shot to Steve Jobsand all Apple users. Just after Gates announced his retirement, my MAC (and that of several of my friends) could no longer do what it had been doing for years (get Hotmail, attach and forward data, etc.), and told us to ""upgrade your browser"". So, we drove 50 miles to the nearest Apple Store, which told us to go to Best Buy or Amazon (to buy a product that says, ""made at Apple in California"" on its box cover). Then, the installation instructions were generic, so we had to hire a consultant to install it on the different models... Now I fully understand why Gates and Jobs get to retire long before me -- the next time Apple and Microsoft pull this scam, I'm cutting everyone out of my life who can't remember how to use snail mail --(Mac OS X Version 10.5.4 Leopard)"
1,Apple Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard,"Apple Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard caused more problems than it solved. I couldn't put it on my laptop (an old 400Mhz Powerbook) and my dual 1Ghz G4's performance was considerably reduced while running in 10.5. My FinalCut 1.1 wouldn't run in 10.5 and and upgrade to FC-4 won't work on a sub 1.25Ghz machine. The 10.5 FontBook made sure my InDesign and Photoshop CS2 couldn't read my fonts, a problem that will continue in CS3. So unless I want to pony-up $5K on new software and hardware, 10.5 is counterproductive. I've already retrograded back to a previous rev (10.3 which is rock solid and running fine.) My 10.5 is headed for craigslist where maybe someone else can use it and I can recoup some of my loss. The moral of the story: ""If works, don't fix it."""
4,Leopard,I like the upgrade. Most impressive is the speed increase. I'm used to OS upgrade slowing things down a bit.
5,Great new cat!,"No problems installing but I suggest you use ""archive and install"" as this gives you a very clean install. Love the Time Machine backups. My Macbook seems to run a bit faster also. All in all a great upgrade. Just get it!"
1,Not ready for market,It is not possible to install Leopard on the Mac Pro without erasing the hard disk. Leopard obviously was not fully tested and debugged before it was marketed.
4,OS 10.5,"A very smooth update with lots of new facets to explore. I backed everything up before updating , but had no problems. It would pay to purchase an external 500 GB hard drive for using the included Time machine to back up. Seems faster and works well with all my essential programs.The only disappointment is the failure to still support Classic and OS 9. Third party emulators may fill the gap."
5,A must have!,"This is a must have upgrade for anyone using Mac OS X. As always with OS upgrades, make sure that you have a full backup of your data. Run Software update for all firmware and OS updates. Make sure that all of your applications are up-to-date (try AppFresh!). Once you're in Leopard, do the software updates again and make sure that all of your programs work.Leopard is excellent. If you are ever on a network with a Windows domain controller, this makes integration very easy and much more compatible. There are so many nice new things in Leopard, but the best is Time Machine. Just buy a huge disk and never think about backups (or restores) again!Oh, if you want to get rid of your Windows domain controller or Windows Exchange server, check out Mac OS X Server 10.5. Your Windows and Mac Leopard clients will work much better!"
4,Upgrade alert,"After you install OS X 10.5.6 check for software updates (""Software Update"" under the Apple menu) especially if you are having application problems. The following happened to me: My ""Mail"" application was not working on my G5. My previous email messages didn't appear and the program wouldn't quit unless I did a force quit. And even though I could go online with a web browser, I couldn't send or receive mail. I called Apple they told me to check for updates. This updated me to 10.5.8 and everything works fine. Also note that upgrading to Leopard takes about two hours. So does adding the updates. Don't get concerned if it looks like the installation has stalled, it just takes a LONG time.I like Leopard but its new features are more fun than productive. Also, you must have an Intel processor to upgrade to Snow Leopard. So you will probably need a Mac Pro.I hope I've been able to help someone."
4,Smooth as silk!,"I have been using OSX since it came out, and this was the easiest upgrade I have ever done. I have had absolutely no problems at all with Leopard and haven't found any of my applications that won't run as they always did in Tiger. I keep a pretty clean system, so I just did the ""upgrade"" option instead of the ""archive and install"" as I have done in the past. It worked well and I liked the fact that I didn't have to reinstall some of my applications. I would highly recommend 10.5. Just do your homework before you upgrade so you don't find out afterwards that a key app. you use hasn't been upgraded to work with Leopard."
4,keepin' up with the changes,I purchased a preowned version of Leopard in order to sync my iPod with my Macbook pro. All in all it's been a smooth transition. The iPod has been working well and nearly full time (24/7)No drawbacks with purchasing less than new.
4,Mac OS X Leopard software,"Software arrived promptly and in great condition, original packaging, just like I bought it from Apple.Good service that is always appreciated.Tsach"
3,Not worth it,"I tried updgrading first, and that was a disaster. A few of my applications were preventing Leopard from starting, so I had to do a clean installation. Is it worth it, well...Time Machine seems pretty cool. It's very similar to Windows System Restore. The multiple desktops (workspaces) feature is cool too. But I could live without that. It's clear Apple wants you to sign up for .MAC, as there are references everywhere for it."
1,"Causes repeated system crashes for G series ""Power-PC"" processors.","This OS is nice and well enough designed for Intel processor machines, but for ""Power-PC"" processor Macs, it's a disaster. I have one of the last of the G5 iMacs (20"") and it never crashed at all with Mac OS 10.4. But with 10.5, IT WILL CRASH EVERY TIME I use iTunes. Sometimes it crashes when I'm using iTunes, and sometimes it will crash after I use that program and quit the application. It doesn't seem to matter what I do. And yes, this is a legal, registered version of the OS. I have reinstalled it twice with no effect. Apple has some serious work to do to make this latest OS viable for their not-too-distant machines. Until they figure it out, users should avoid this OS.Thanks for reading,-CL"
1,Not worth the money,"Leopard is not worth the money, i.e. the latest update (10.5.2) causes me all sorts of trouble, i.e. my iMac slows down after 5 minutes or when I open more than 2 applications and it freezes after 10 minutes or when I open the 3rd application. All things, that you know and could have from Windows for half the money."
1,Nothing but frustration,"I installed Leopard on my intel Mac Book and noticed immediate problems. Apps were not closing even after force quitting, the machine did not shut down, at all. After downloading and installing the first update the desktop stopped working entirely. It is currently at the Mac store and I was told the problems were not hardware related. They are attempting an erase install to see if it will work. Thank goodness I archived everything before installing, otherwise an entire novel that I have written would be gone. Overall, the most frustrating experience I've ever had with a computer. I wish I had just stayed with Tiger."
1,BE AWARE; THIS SLOWS DOWN YOUR COMPUTER BIGTIME!!,"I thought my laptop would run better.....boy was I wrong. The new operating system has made my computer slow. I have a 17"" macbook pro 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4 GB of 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM. I'm going to try a clean install instead of the upgrade. As of now. This new system has really slowed my computer down. It also takes forever to boot back up. I'm going to make an appointment at the apple customer service center near me to see what's up."
5,leopard,Excellent upgrade to my former operating system. Lots of bells and whistles to accompany productivity. Apple does it again!
3,Leopard on Mac Pro 2.66 NVIDIA GeForce 7300 GT,In general I have been happy with Leopard although I have had some problems.I have an Envision G22LWK monitor and my display has not worked properly with Leopard when connected over DVI. The monitor displays nothing until I Sleep the computer and bring it out of standby. Tiger did not have this display problem.I also had one Kernel panic related to my USB modem and Caller ID software
2,Better have a lot of speed and memory!,"I was an early adopter of just about every other previous Mac operating version with no problems. With Leopard, I loaded the program into my older G4 dual processor 1.2 Ghz, 1 gigabite of ram and the machine slowed to a stuttering halt.I followed the uninstall directions figuring that I had done some faupaux that Leopard did not like and found that when I did a clean reinstall the same problem persisted. My take is that you better have an operating system a lot more robust with plenty of ram to take advantage of this software.Okay, I really have been looking at a new iMac...Bill Wise CPP"
1,"Buggy as an ant hill, Just updated to 10.5.1 No Improvement",Product should not have been released yet! Don't try it with a G4! To many problems that even Apple has no answers for.
2,Make sure you have enough memory!,"This OS really needs a lot of memory. Make sure that you have enough. I didn't, and had to spend another $150 to upgrade. This also makes my computer run a lot HOTTER, which will no doubt result in a shorter lifespan of the machine.There are a few bugs, which they haven't seemed to work out yet. I've had problems with crashing. Also plan on SEVERAL HOURS to load OS 10.5, and several more to make adjustments and reset all of your preferences.I loved my old OS 10.3.9, but newer software was no longer compatible. And you can say goodbye to all of your old OS 9 programs, they won't work anymore.Apple should have fixed this stuff before release. But they didn't."
5,Leopard MAC OS X VERSION 10.5 APPLE,This version is great! Easy upgrade on my Mac Book Pro from Tiger. Great new features!
4,Faster than Tiger (10.4),"I upgraded my Intel iMac from Tiger to Leopard, painlessly. Ignore all those articles out there talking of data-loss bugs; the 10.5.1 patch seems to clear all that up (not that I ever experienced it anyways). My system seems peppier and I love the new Spaces feature. I'm a long-time Unix/Linux user and multiple desktops is a welcome feature in OS X. My only reason for less than 5 stars is that I'm a Java developer by trade and I was disappointed to find that Apple did not bundle Java 6 with Leopard but I'm sure it will come eventually. All in all, the upgrade to Leopard was far easier than any Windows upgrade I've ever performed and my system performs *better* after the upgrade - something you won't find on Windows. I'm a relatively new Mac user and the biggest misconception I had was that there was ""no software available."" It's basically quality over quantity with a Mac."
4,Leopard X 10.5 Upgrade,"Wonderful product. It was easy to install even with my limited computer ability. So far I have tried IChat with my son and loved it. He was able to help me fix problems on my computer over the internet. Coverflow is great, I can see now review all my pictures/documents etc that I have on my computer a great time saver for finding things. I haven't tried Time Machine but, my son loves it. It does require you to own an external hard drive. It works as advertised. I think this is a great upgrade..."
5,osx 10.5,"works well on my imac g5. i like time machine - probably worth the price because i don't backup enough on my own. otherwise most improvements are transparent, i think..."
4,Leopard is great!,Leopard is a great upgrade to a wonderful operating system. It takes a while to get used to how all the features work.. but over time it will be hard to see how you lived without them.Stacks are a great addition to being able to quickly find what you need. The To-Do lists in Mail are useful although the reminders might not fit everyone's idea of what you need. And if you don't use Apple Mail that won't help. The sideBar is a quick way to find other computers on your network... just a few features I've enjoyed.You do have to be ready for this release - I would highly recommend finding the Apple Forum and reading up on what it means to be ready. Also there are some features that only work on Intel Macs - so don't be too disapointed
4,Mac OS X Leopard more & less than expected,"Overall, this is a nice addition to the mac family and to my personal computing experience. I love the new dock, and I'm sure I will love spaces once i get a little more used to it. at the moment, though, it's slightly confusing. To me, the best part is the preview windows in the dock, and the ability to preview items in your finder by hitting the space bar. My only real complaint is that iTunes decided to stop syncing my iPod Touch after I installed 10.5.1. Nothing I've done has fixed it. I'm going to keep researching, but I use my mac for music more than anything else, so that's a big bummer for me.Other than that, though, it's a winner!"
3,"It's OK, but...","I'm a Mac fan, and I got this upgrade because I thought it would be like every other OS X upgrade. They usually seem to make my computer faster, and ad some great features.This didn't, it actually is slower, it messed up my computer when I installed it... and then once it finally started working it was really buggy. I think apple really rushed this one out the door. Subsequent updates have helped out, but really... it wasn't worth the price, which is the first OS X upgrade (I've used every version of OS X) to have that problem."
2,Leopard is still quite buggy,"We loaded OSX 10.5 about 2 weeks ago. It has had several problems working with our existing software and crashing. Our Powerpoint failed to open. I could no longer make pdf copies from my ArchiCad Plotmaker program. It forced us into getting updates for both of these programs and also to update the RAM in my iMac G5. These updates were probably overdue anyway, but it made it a considerably more expensive upgrade than we bargained for. We have already received some patches for the Leopard. It seems like the program was not quite ready for prime time when it was released."
4,Each version is better than the last,"Each upgrade of Mac OS X improves over the last. For me, 10.5 is stabler than 10.4. I like the integration between Mail and iCal and Address Book. Being able to create event or contact from an email is easy and a real time saver.A couple of negatives. Events are harder to edit than in 10.4. Mail offers syncing with Google, so you have your contacts on your Google account as well as Address book. I've found this to create duplicate addresses and contacts - not helpful because you have to purge those from Address Book.I look forward to 10.6 and its promise of more efficiency over features."
5,Just gets better and better!,"I admit to being biased on this subject, having worked at Apple for 4 years back in the '90's, but OSX V10.5.x, is far and away the all around best operating system in the world today, bar none. Spaces, Time Machine, memory utilization, it all represents a new state of the art in personal computing. If you're hesitating on upgrading, don't! It's worth every penny!"
3,Leopard limited to OS 10 documents,Be forewarned that Leopard does not support any documents created with classic enviroment (OS 9 or earlier). You will not be able to access any of those documents or use any of that software with this update.
4,good good,the software arrived and upon putting it in the computer it was discovered that the disc was defective. the company sent two replacement copies and all went well.thanks
4,Mac OS X 10.5,I have a PowerBook G4 (1.5 GHz) and so far this system is working great. I had no trouble installing it and it seems to be running quickly and cleanly. It fixed the interface problem I was having and I'm hoping will give me another good year out of an old machine.
4,What can be said,"Started running into issues that I needed to have Leopard to run some newer software, and the upgrade to Snow Leopard would only be $30 for Leopard user. Upgrading was a no-brainer, and I am again at peace with myself and my MAC."
2,not for older macs,If your buying a new mac w/ leopard of if your computer is just a few months old then Leopard is awesome!!!But I upgraded on a 1.5 powerbook and it came to a screaming halt! I have never been so unhappy w/ my laptop. Put it this way my old 800 g4 iMac now runs circles around my powerbook. I don't know whether to reformat my powerbook or wait and hope for updates.
4,Great for older Macs with no Intel processor,"For those like me who let their older Macs sit for a couple years and lapse into non-functionality by not upgrading, this is as far as we can go. The newer Macs with the Intel processors can upgrade all the way to the new OS X Lion. Power Macs? Not so much. But for older Macs, this brings you back to functionality. The only Flash player available for older Macs lags and delays, so if you watch a lot of TV shows online or YouTube videos, I hope you're a patient person. Or just get a newer Mac. For basic use, this version of OS X 10.5 is what you need."
4,Macintosh OS X Verl 10.5.6,"Personally, I wouldn't upgrade to this version again. I've had nothing but trouble with older software. First my SmartAlarms wouldn't work. Then PhotoShop failed to launch. Then Toast failed to launch. It has cost me way too much for ??. I was using OS 10.4.11 which was working just fine. There simply isn't enough difference between the two versions to make it worth upgrading. That's just my opinion. I wish I hadn't upgraded. The reason I gave it four stars is it's a good product. It just isn't for me."
4,Evolutionary but very well-designed upgrade.,"1. Leopard is an evolutionary upgrade like every upgrade of OS X since 2001. Feature-wise, it's somewhere in-between modest and major.2. It's a good one. It's got a good deal more hits and misses. Quick Look, Time Machine, Spaces, a better Finder, and a ton of polish everywhere stand out as stars. Even Stacks (which frankly still need a little love from Apple) have their pleasures.3. If you like software, you will want this. Leopard-savvy apps coming out over the next year or two will take advantage of Leopard's very snazzy CoreAnimation toolkit, and they will be very, very cool.4. Bottom line: it's pretty hard to go back to Tiger after using Leopard for a few days."
3,MAC Leopard software,It appears to be working just fine. Glad I could find this software since Apple Stores do not carry it anymore!
3,"OS X 10.5.4 - good software, upgrade sucked","I attempted an upgrade from 10.3.8 and that process got hung-up. Worse, what had been a perfectly fine iMac became a bookend - the critter wouldn't even boot! Processor is fine & there was plenty of memory, so I eventually took the unit to the nearest Apple store - an hour+ distant. I didn't feel quite so stupid after it took the Genius Bar folks over four hours to resolve all the issues. Be REAL careful with this.... After all that churn, I'm real happy with the software, especially the Time Machine function - now I'll always have a current bootable backup. ;o)"
1,Not worth the trouble- or the money,I bought Leopard in November and has endless trouble- I did a clean install and the problems were all with Leopard itself- not third party software or anything like that.The actual cosmetic improvements over Tiger aren't worth the trouble or the expense. I have gone back to Tiger in fact.I'd say you should wait for some updates to iron out the early problems- but really this software isn't ready for the mass market and shame on Apple for selling it like this.
5,Leopard operating system,Apple Mac OS X Version 10.5 LeopardI installed 5 days ago and am very pleased with the product. Afterward I attached a Western Digital 160 gb Passport external hard drive and it failed. Tried again with a replacement Passport and it too failed. I will try again when a new iomega drive arrives and then I may find out which product is culpable
3,Overall a slick OS,"For me is hasn't been a huge improvement over Tiger, but it is very nice in general. The interface is slick and polished, very responsive. Easy screen sharing between computers on my home network is a nice feature. SMB networking doesn't work at all for me, but hopefully that will be fixed in the next update."
4,Mac OS X Leopar is worth the upgrade,The upgrade was extremely simple and straightforward. I did a clean install and reinstalled all of my 3rd party apps as well as my copy of iLife. It all went swimmingly and the new features are great.
1,"Go directly to Apple, by phone","I just verified S. Hiss' comments from April. If you are a registered Mac owner, you can avoid the over inflated prices of some of the 3rd party resellers. Call Apple at 1-800.my.apple where you can purchase a copy of OS 10.5.6 for $129, plus tax, with free shipping."
4,Leopard review,"The install was fairly painless, although some of my widgets stopped working and there was the worry about new security holes that were mentioned in a couple e-rags. All in all, it does well and was worth the upgrade price."
3,Love the look but hate the wireless networking problems,"Apple,I love the look of your new leopard but I have had nothing but problems with wireless internet on Leopard. I had no problems at all with Tiger on the same machine but I am constantly getting dropped connections with my wireless internet on Leopard. I hope you can fix these problems soon!!"
1,A lot More Headaches than I expected,"I would have loved to have given Leopard five stars, but....I Installed Leopard on my iMac G5 (plenty of RAM) about a month ago and am having a lot of buggy problems: Time Machine stalling or backing up very slowly, "".mac"" backup and sync in an endless loop (won't stop backing up!), bluetooth not working, dashboard frozen, i-disk frozen, to name a few. I consider myself fairly tech savvy and not afraid to experiment, but Leopard has taken up waaaaaay too much of my time. I have a Powerbook G4 (still has Tiger) and that cannot sync with my iMac now; address book and iCal on Leopard are incompatible with Tiger, and I don't want to install Leopard on my Powerbook.Frankly, I am going to reinstall Tiger and wait for the service packs to come out on Leopard. The aggravation is just not worth it to me and the benefits of Leopard are slim."
1,"REALLY BAD ~ wait for more updates, this sucks!!! 05-19-08","We have three Mac's in the house and are VERY pro Apple. Got Leopard for the G-4. We exceed speed and memory requirements as well as RAM. Since it's been installed ~ it'll lock up and freeze. We've reloaded and rechecked everything. I was told to: Wait for a few updates! Well excuse me Mr. Apple, this thing should WORK out of the box, not months later when you get around to it. So after living with Leopard (should be renamed Leper) we're pulling it out, putting Tiger back in. It's just a horrible system about 98% of it. Yes, the time machine feature is good. But the way it locks up, loses downloads, files items, and gives you ZERO HELP all I can see is Mr. Jobs needs to kick the designers in the rear and go back to the drawing board."
1,Apple following in the footsteps of Microsoft,"Leopard is terrible. Loaded on my MacBook and it would not work with my xerox networked printer. In addition, it kept dropping connections on my wireless network. I went back to Tiger and all is working well as before. I wish I would have saved my money."
2,won't run most software,"My family got a new Mac that came with Leopard. None of my kids' software games will run on it because it ""does not support the classic environment"" or something like that. Basically, as I have now discovered, anything before OS X 10.5 (Leopard) had the ability to read software that was made for both PCs and Macs, but the new version can not. I spent a long time at the store looking for kids' games that would run on our new computer, but I could only find one.I have also had trouble with scanning photos and documents from my HP scanner/printer to the computer, but that could just be a problem with Macs in general."
3,Yes and No.,"Do I reccommend this product? Yes and No. Many people buy this for the eye candy features, such as the iChat special effects. But does it work on a PowerPc Mac? Nope. Not at all. You can keep dreaming, because after contacting Apple, I didn't get the impression that these features will EVER work on a PowerPc. There are many advertised features that simply do not exist on my iMac because it's not an Intel based system. However, what DOES work is pretty darn nice. I'll keep playing around with the programs to discover what else I can cross off my new features list."
2,too many gliches and bugs,"as nice as it is, a leopard upgrade is very unstable and reliable. i've paid too much money for this to downgrade back to tiger. i'm hoping that as more updates come, the better it will be."
1,unable to run OS 10.5.6,I 'm running OS 10.4.11 on a powerpc G5. I installed OS 10.5.6 but then was unable to boot my computer. I'm not happy about the whole thing. It was a lot of work for nothing.
5,MacOS X Version 10.5.4 Leopard,I could not believe how quickly I received my item. It had the original wrapping from the factory. It works great.
3,MAC OS X 10.5,"Item was preordered and was delayed and new order submitted; receieved orginal order that was lost, and returned new order."
5,perfect but no bargain,Excellent product.Shipped in a timely manner.Priced the same as on Mac Connection though.
2,Worst version yet! Lots and lots o' BUGS!!,I love my mac but have had many many problems with Leopard.Some have been fixed by the last updates but problems still existApple needs to GET THE BUGS OUT!!Its shameful that they released this version so late and in such poor condition.On the upside there are a couple of cool things but still not worth the problems.
5,Get it. The handwriting is on the wall.,"If you plan to continue upgrading your Mac's applications, you will NEED to have this as most new upgrades will require Leopard. Yes, it does take about 90 minutes to install, but you don't have to sit there and stare at it doing so. Go out for coffee.Far less hassle than installing a Windows upgrade. No problems or issues whatsoever with the installation. If you have an older iMac with low RAM, be sure to get a RAM upgrade (I would suggest at least 1gb) before installing this.The interface is a bit prettier, and I haven't used its new features yet. The transition should be minimal for you if you are currently using Tiger."
5,For fun computing experience,"I am an old die hard DOS/Windows user. Few years ago started migrating to MAC. Not completely there yet. When I want to enjoy computing, my MAC PowerBook is where I go. And, Leopard has bee a joy multiplier for that computer! In few weeks, I will be ordering my MAC Pro and will make the full switch to the MAC platform relegating Vista to a ""window within Leopard status"" for the stuff not available on an Apple, there are few of these but getting less and less!!!"
3,"Some nice improvements, but many bugs to fix","If you have printers and software you depend on, don't buy this until everyone has their act together. I bought it and the bugs are frustrating, I'd recommend waiting for 6 months and let the idiots like me help Apple fix stuff."
3,Over Priced,"I purchased two iMac g5's with Mac os 10.5.6 pre-installed. I wanted a dics in case i needed to re-install in the event of a hard drive crash or failure. I searched the internet for countless hours and all the prices were quite high. I finally found the 10.5.6 dvd for $29.00 plus the 10.6 leopard snow disc was included for the same price. While it is a good thing to see it sold here, because many stores no longer sells it. I believe it's a little over priced. I bought both 10.5.6 and 10.6 snow leopard for 29.00 from an apple retailer in NYC. Consider it a deal here at Amazon because it's hard to find."
4,Necessary Upgrade,"Leopard 10.5.1 navigates smoothly, yet additional memory, also was installed. The iMacG5 is not a light home PC; I was glad I did not buy a new computer."
3,not that great in grass,"Works well on hard surfaces, but in the grass not so great. The grass has a tendancy to knock the stuff off that you've already picked up. Also, the welded nut on the handle (for the wing bolt) was broken off and laying in the bottom of the box when it was delivered. I couldn't return it because I needed it the next day for a job. It wasn't a big deal though; I just drilled through and put on a bolt and a wing nut. All in all; not bad for the price."
5,Awsome,"I work as a machinist, metal chips all over the floor. I bought this to make clean up much easier, and it did! I was worried that for the price, it wouldn't hold enough, or hold up to the job I need it to do, but so far so good, works perfectly! Great product for a cheap price!"
3,Mag Sweeper,"A nice tool for the price, i would suggest for limited use. We have rebuilt this tool for our needs, it was coming apart after several weeks of use of about 2 hours per day"
4,Good Value,"The unit does not have a very solid feel, but it performs well, especially for the price. I recently had new siding, windows, doors, and roofing installed and this sweeper has picked up over 5 pounds of nails, screws, and other fasteners the contractors failed to clean up from the exterior of my home. Like others my unit arrived dented where the axles attach to the main unit, due to poor packaging by the vendor."
5,Powerful magnetic for all applications...,"I originally purchased this in order to ""sweep my grass"" for any nails/screws that might be present, for I drive my car across the lawn occasionally, and didn't want a puncture... ...that said, this works for all applications, and makes picking up a spilled container of screws a breeze... ...simply roll over it, and then release the magnet over a shop dust pan (or something) in order to easily divert your screws back into said container."
4,It's ok,"Works great on flat surface. I have a shorter one, which high centers much less. fun way to do some clean up."
2,Can't be used in grass taller than about a 1/2 inch,"Picks up metal great, but if you're doing it in grass, its so low to the ground, the grass scrapes off anything you pick up. I ended up going terribly slow, and when I heard it pick up something, I stopped and by hand, picked up the item before the grass brushed it off.Works good on flat surfaces and concrete, but I can already see those nails and pick them up or sweep them up."
4,Good value,"I bought this unit to clean up nails after re-roofing my house.It's fantastic on flat hard surfaces and just OK on rough surfaces. The picked up nails can get brushed off again by grass, but it still works. You just end up going over the same area a bunch of times and checking for nails more often. Nails that are embedded in the ground generally don't come out. We found that raking the grass then immediately going over it with the magnet picked up most of them.For the price, I think it's a decent value. I think it saved me enough tire punctures to pay for itself."
4,Heavy Duty,"This is heavy duty magnet but it was poorly packaged. The ends where the axles attach were severely bent when it arrived. If I didn't need it that day I would have returned it. I took it apart and straightened everything out and put it back together, it then worked like a charm. Do small areas in the grass because the grass has a tendency to knock the nails, staples and screws off but it's still a good value for the money."
2,The title of the offering is misleading.,"I expected David Pogue's delightful and insightful take on using my new IMac specifically to surf the Internet. What I got was David Pogue's IMac for Dummies (a terrific book which I had already bought and which included some info on surfing the Net!) and The Internet for Macs for Dummies, a general thing by some other guy on using any old Mac to surf the Internet.Am I disappointed? You bet!"
2,The title is totally misleading,"I agree word for word with the reader from Brixey, MO. The description should have made it clear what the Kit consisted of. Delightful as anything by David Pogue is, I certainly don't need two of the same book. Major bummer!"
4,A coffee table book of the best kind,"In a sequel to her _Plantagenet Chronicles,_ Hallam follows the same style and layout and indulges in the same lavishness of illustration. In addition to the four generations of monarchs in the title, one finds featured many of the other influential figures of the time, including St. Louis IX, William Wallace, Dante and Chaucer, Thomas Aquinas, Francis of Assisi, and even Jenghiz Khan. From the birth of the Age of Chivalry to the Black Death that killed almost half of Europe (and precipitated the decline of Norman-Angevin feudalism), these were what the old Chinese curse might regard as ""interesting times."""
5,Love this stuff,"Cannot find this in any store close to me, so I have to stock up. Great fragrance with my body chemistry."
4,Excellent compendium,"This book provides an excellent overview of all of the major elements of various carriages. Each is accompanied by a concise explanation of the construction. The collection used comes from two of the major magazines in the field, ""Carriage Monthly"" and ""The Hub"". I was particularly pleased that the book was in a ring and binder format. It made utilizing the various instructions much easier to manage. The only thing I would have liked was if the pictures were in color instead of black and white."
4,Oakley eyeshield,This is the best you can see everything. I'v played 4 seasons and its still not scrathed and i'm the Widereceiver.
2,Decent Analysis of Priestley's Plays,"Hughes does a decent job of analysing Priestley's plays, but a much better grasp could be easily found by reading Priestley. Very little except drama is given treatment here."
5,Finally something that works!,My puppy has had some ear problems lately and I could not afford to buy some expensive cleanser from the vet. I searched and found this cleanser and I'm happy with the results. Does what it says! My puppy didn't even complain while I was putting it in his ears (a miracle since he has always struggled!). I highly recommend this product.
3,Ear Cleanser for dogs,This product was delivered in just a few days. Thank you! I have used it several times to rinse the ears on my shih-tzu and it works well.
5,I finally found it,"I have been looking for this video for several years. When I put it in the DVD player to watch with my son, it took me back to my childhood! This is a great version of the classic and would recommend to anyone seeking the same."
2,"Get ""The Chuck Jones Collection"" instead.","Only two shorts?If you are looking for Rikki Tikki, the content of this DVD (along with FOUR other shorts) is available on ""The Chuck Jones Collection"":Chuck Jones Collection"
4,a child fave...,"a great child classic...I remember both these classics from childhood and just had to have DVD for my collection.They hardly make em like this anymore, great art and educational,thoughtful at the same time"
5,rikki tikki tavi,"I am 37, and remember watching this on network TV as a child. I remember it being the coolest thing ever when I was about 7. I now have a three year old daughter and we watch it together a couple of times a month. It is a great story and really brings back some very fond memories and has also allowed me to make some new ones. Highly reccomemded."
3,"""Bonus Story"" ruins this DVD","Fortunately I did not pay money for this DVD. I would have returned it had I. Rikki-Tikki-Tavi is a great telling of the Rudyard Kipling story. My kids enjoyed this as much as I did as a child. However, the ""bonus story"" of Yankee Doodle Cricket was absolutely horrid. Historical inaccuracies, a rather overt adult situation and perfectly awful story telling make it a worthless waste of time and space."
5,Rikki Tikki Terrific,I remember this movie from when I was a kid and it was just as excellent to share now with my children and my students.
3,"works, but slightly dirty lens","I returned my first order to the seller because there were some large dark speckles in the lens itself. After receiving the replacement, I noticed the similar speckles, but not as noticeable and smaller. Overall, the lens works as expected, but be careful about what you're paying for. If you're looking for top quality stuff for your camera or camcorder, then I'd suggest you look at some of the other brands of fisheye lenses. I can't see any noticeable specks in the photos afterwards, but if so, it's not too much trouble to Photoshop them out. In summary, I believe Opteka may have a quality issue on their hands - dirty assembly or something which causes dirt to get trapped within the lens at time of creation. The quality does not appear to be a reflection on the seller's part."
2,Very disappointing production,"This was one of those movies which we should have left in the past! We had very fond memories of it, but in spite of excellent re-mastering, the content was very flat and wooden. Ann Blyth, who we generally like very much, was hopelessly miscast, and the rest of the cast, including the great Howard Keel, found very little to get excited about in their roles. Musically, apart from a couple of famous numbers, it had very little to offer. The highlight was the performance of Marjorie Main and Bert Lahr; particularly in a scene in the extras, which had been deleted: obviously because the director felt they would have taken over the whole movie, if it had been included! Think carefully before buying!"
3,Rose-Marie,"As a musical this is okayu...I like ANn BLythe and Howard Keel...not their best (compare to Kismet) but the music is good and the Indian dancing is actually quite hilarous, but the dancers are good...fun watching."
5,love it,"Cannot get over how proffetional amazon ar in the way they conduct bussiness,and there aproach to promped level when it comes to posting and handling and basicly under standing the custermers needs,making shore at the end of the day the customer is kept happy in making a purchase with amazon.Keep it up guy,s.Thank,s."
5,Exactly what I wanted,I was looking for a way to store a large amount of pictures and to have the ability to add more pictures in the future. This is exactly what I was looking for.
2,1 out of 3,My initial order was just this 3 pack and I'm not impressed. Two of them have been recorded over 2 times but 1 was bad from the get go. That's not a good average.
3,Gemini,"Gemini was an average Star Trek novel, with nothing to really make it stand out from the piles of other ST novels that have been written. That's not to say that it's bad, though. The characterizations of Kirk and his crew are pretty much dead-on, and the mystery of who the real villain was is somewhat surprising.The subplot about Kirk's nephew, Peter, doesn't really work, though. It just distracts from the main story and isn't really even slightly interesting.All in all, the plot is somewhat predictable and ultimately forgettable. I would recommend that unless you're a die-hard ST fan, that you pass this one up."
3,Did not have many of the schools we were interested in,"For the schools we were interested in, this book was great. The problem was that the many of the schools that my daughter was interested in were not even included in the book. Had I known that, I would not have purchased it."
4,very helpful college guide,The Fiske guide provides a very useful start to the college search process. It is easy and fun to read through and gives you a quick general idea of what the school is like and how competative it is to get in. The biggest drawback is that many schools are not included in the book.
4,One of the Best,"This guide, along with the Princeton Review guide, are both very comprehensive in the amount of facts they bring to the table. Fiske also makes a good read."
1,Optima,"After using 2 bottles of this product, I notice absolutely no difference in my cats dander or shedding. Waste of money!"
1,Exchanging one problem for another,"My older cat has dander problems so the vet recommended this product. While I was at it I put it in both my cats foodIt might have helped his skin and fur, but after giving him the quantity specified on the package, he got diarrhea. I decided dander was preferable to diarrhea.The other cat ran when she smelled it in her food.So, bottom line, I use it rarely in smaller amounts for one cat and not at all for the other."
2,Optima for cats,I have 3 cats I could not get 2 of them to even taste the product and the one that did ate some with her food and vomited it up about 15 minutes later. I did also buy the product for my dog and she loves it. Eats it with her food fine.
5,2 late is wonderful,"Okay, Lovesong is a brilliant song, but the reason to buy this single is for ""2 late"", possibly the best pop song The Cure has ever written...even up there with ""Just Like Heaven"". This song might have been a hit had it not been forced into obscurity by the explanation that it didn't fit within the flow of the Disintegration album, which is a true statement. It really should have been a stand-alone single though.""Fear of Ghosts"" is also a great song.. Slower and darker, giving an almost manic depressive theme to this single. It's definitely b-side material (unless you're talking about the early 80s Cure albums where this would fit in perfectly).So, this single is a must-buy! It contains a moody b-side, a hit single, and a should-have-been-hit-single!"
5,2 Late,"2 Late and Love Song should have been switched. Throughout the two minutes 38 seconds which is 2 Late, you get lost in the undercurrent of the constant four chord progession and the two (three?) guitars... and Mr. Smith's dreamy voice one octave lower than usual. 2 Late is my second favorite next to Disintegration (the song)."
5,"Good, no, GREAT jazz!","I'd bought this CD years ago, but lost it. The title of the album says it all. The music has that feel to it of old world jazz and new world jazz rolled into one. The musicians that make up the band are phenomenal, everyone of them standouts on their instruments. But I've got to mention Dan Brubeck, the man can play some serious drums. The title song, Old World New World, really showcases his talent. I was so glad I was able to replace the CD I'd lost. Thanks Amazon."
1,Error in signatures!,"Well, this was useless to me because it was printed incorrectly. The signatures (sections of the book) were out of sequence when it went to press. Thus, the pages are out of order and, therefore, it was difficult to use as a reference."
5,Berlitz Dictionary/Berlitz Woordenboek: Dutch-English/Engels-Nederland s (Bilingual Dictionary),"As I am planning a holiday to the Netherlands I found this little book a good size and very informative, can recommend it!"
4,Repeater,"this is a classic movie that never gets old. maybe it's because i grew up in a town like this one but regardless, the cast is great, the story is common and it's just a fun one to watch."
3,Solid contrast between Arminian and Calvinist theology,"This book offers a concise and well stated differentiation between Arminian (and Wesleyan) theological roots against Calvinist theology. The primary focus is on the historical contexts that led to the divergence of these two branches of Christian theology. As a primer, this is an excellent tool."
3,Interesting but not biblical,"I've read very little that has been convincing against Calvinism. This book is merely history, very little biblical thought. It's interesting though! I suggest if you're looking for a good debate find one on the net, not this book!"
5,Great book!,I bought this book when I started herbology classes and I love it!I made my first ointment from this book.It is a must have.
3,"beautiful, but it's not my go-to book","this one is-20,000 Secrets of Tea. Victoria Zak. ISBN 0440235294. Herbs are comprehensively described in alphabetical order; herb and ailment are listed in the index as well."
3,Herbal Medicine makers handbook,"Good beginner's guide ,no heavy processing ,no knowledge of chemistry needed. If you're going to play with this stuff you aught to also have a herbal PDR."
3,I haven't gotten into this one yet.,"you've got to read a book to know if you'll like it. I haven't yet. I do like the pictures of different herbs, since I'm a forager as well as an herbalist."
5,James Green,"Wonderful book on making many different herbal-based products. Clearly written with easy to follow recipes, which you can make in your kitchen with readily available and inexpensive equipment."
1,not at all what I expected.....,"I need manual that can help me find needed information in 5 Minutes, not something I have to read for hours and still not find what I wanted."
2,Lots of new age loony toon baloney,"You better have a stomach for new age kookiness. I lost it when I was admonished to bow down to the weeds in my yard and offer a lock of my hair, a prayer or song to make the spirits of my dandilions happy. I am looking for good information not swaddled in goofy pantheism."
4,Herbal medicene,"This is a pretty good book. It's hard to buy a book on line. Kind of like trying to buy perfume on line. Some things you just need to SEE to know if it's right for you.None the less, the information I will obtain from this book will be of value. I'm not sorry I bought it."
3,YIKES!!!!!!!,"OMG! I am still flabbergasted after reading this book. Not only is the book hard to navagate but, the author is a bit kookoo. I purchased this book wanting to learn about makeing my own medicine at home, not read about how plants have fealings. I found it really hard to finish this book,(I just cant see myself saying thank you to a plant). Once you finally wade through the babbling on and on there is some great information.If you want a book that you can open up and use quickly this is NOT the book for you. If you like to read to find the information that you want then you will love it. The only reason I am giving this book three stars is beacuse once you finally wade through the babbling, the information is reliable and usefull."
5,wonderful information,This book was easy to read and simple to follow. I would recommend for anyone wanting a natural solution to ailments and pain management.
5,"best book, best price.","This book is a must have for any student of herbal medicine. Great price, book was in immaculate shape, and the book offers chapter after chapter of great info, and with a fresh outlook for those interested mainly on TCM. Truly a gem, I can't immagine being unhappy about buying this book. My Thanks to the author for sharing his wealth of knowledge."
5,Enlightenment at it's best!,"I have been interested in Tarot reading for many years and buy whatever is new about the subject.Rebirth Of The Oracle by Alessi and McMillan is unquestionably the best Tarot book I have ever read.Reading the Court Cards is a real treat. The depth of understanding these two women have about the significations in Tarot is unparalleled. As I read the Queen of Pentacles,it was as if these women knew me personally !My metaphysical group had a marvelous time reading the significators and applying it to our own lives. The clarity and conciseness of this book far overshadows any of the one hundred plus books I have read on the subject. For any reader,novice or master,this book is a must have!I can say with certainty that this is the only book necessary because every bit of information and any question you could possibly want an answer to is between the covers of this gem of a book."
2,No aroma or flavor,I got this tea as a gift. Upon opening tin foil I noticed immediately there was no aroma and the tea was bone dry and flaky. Brewed it up and it really just makes colored water. Tea leaves are just shards rather than leaves. Save your money.
3,Very Mild,I found this tea to be just about tasteless. To me it did not have a strong enough flavor to even recognize it as Darjeeling.
1,poor quality,"I was really looking forward to seeing the movies, it has a great list of them to choose from. I found it grainy and the sound quality very poor. Only order if you are desperate to see these movies."
2,No Mission to Moscow,I bought this for the movie Mission to Moscow. When I did a search at Amazon it pointed to this collection. I was disappointed.
2,classic duds,"I had high hopes for this one- only to be really disappointed. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting every movie to grab me; but most of these don't even have grabbers! I guess the old saying ""You get what you pay for"" is true once again!"
1,HIstoric Classics Exploited,"Many of these are good films and some are not. All of them need restoration. If you buy this set, you will be delaying and possibly killing any possibility of having them restored. They are not covered by copyright, which is why they have been issued in this inexpensive and poor quality edition. Unfortunately if such editions exist and the public buys them there is no reason for anyone to invest the money to restore the films because the customers have already bought. Support those who are willing to bring these classics to market in a restored condition and ignore those who are out for a cheap buck."
1,50 pack of poor quailty films,"My advice for anyone thinking of buying any of the movies in the 50 Packseries. is to fud get a'bout it!This series would be great, if the films were remaster in the way thatCriterion do their movies.But they are not. They are in poor condition. Barely viewable, faded andgrainy. True they are a value. but you would be better off saving your cash and buying better quaility versions these films as they come out."
1,50 HISTORIC MOVIES DVD GREAT HISTORY BOX SET,"THIS IS THE POOREST QUAILY MOVIE SET I HAVE EVER SEEN ITS LIKE WATCHING A MOVIE THROUGH SMEARED GLASSES,TO ME ITS NOT WORTH 50CENTS A MOVIE. AND I LOVE THE OLD TIME MOVIES.IF YOU DONT MIND THE SMEARED PICTURE THESE ARE GREAT MOVIES. WHEN I FIND THESE THAT ARE REMASTERED AND BETTER QUAILTY I AM GOING TO THROW THESE IN THE TRASH."
5,no oscar winners here but some good b thru z grade movies,i have reviewed many of these 50 pack movies and as always you get some good some bad and some that can't be listed as anything. their are some very intresting movies here and more than a few silent movies also.once again if you are looking for great transfers stay away but if you are a little more bold you will find some gems in this batch. these films are mostly family friendly as are most of these sets so you can watch them as a family and not have to worry about anything you don't want your kids to see. take a chance and enjoy. for 40 to 50 cents a movie what have you got to lose.
1,Colossal waste of time/money.,"This book is the worst attempt at conveying information in a readable manner. It has typeos throughout. Written in German, translated to English. It's a dinosaur. This 3rd edition is from 1999. I can't believe that my class assigned this to the class as our only source of course material. The examples show only portions of what they're trying to explain, there isn't much on the net to clarify the examples, so you're pretty much on your own. The teacher actually called this book ""a piece of crap"" and blames it's use on the university. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. And I like BPM, a lot. Was looking forward to taking this class, but it's money down the drain."
2,What about sound...?,"Sorry for Olga Kern, but this is sure the worst recorded SACD in my collection of classical SACD's (about 30, half of them by Tchaikovsky). The sound is very disappointed and take no comparsion with various CD's (incl. low budget labels), recorded 30 - 40 years ago. The well-known beginning of first movement fade sadly into the space, it goes not under the skin. Tchaikovsky without full sounding emotions, what's that..? No, thanks. There are many other better recordings, even in CD format ... Garry Graffman (Szell), Svjatoslav Richter (Karajan), Rafael Orozco (De Waart) f.e."
4,Good,It was a good game but a bit short for fans of Final Fantasy. Really it isn't even a FF game at all it is a different RPG but dubbed as being a FF game as it was in the US. I like to think of it as short but sweet.
4,Good To Go,"The Fusion 15's (I bought 2) are proving to be a great value for the money. If you shop around like I did, you can get them for $70 each. Having a $70 mic for overheads on drum recording may sound like a real ham 'n egg operation, but these mics are really doing the job. You need to work on placement, just like with much more expensive mics, but once you've got right spot, the F-15's pick up everything - clearly. The gain on the board need not be cranked in order to pick up the crash cymbals correctly. With almost no efects added, the F-15 pick up the attack and decay of all cymbals, with again, amazing clarity. They also pick up, and add nicely to, the sound of the ""drums"" in your mix. You can go buy more expensive mics, but how much better they will sound, given the home recording setup, will not justify their purchase. Save your money - buy these. You can use the savings to buy more gear, or maybe some cold beer to sip while you listen to your great sounding tracks."
4,Great for beginners,"Noah Lukeman writes as though he's 100 years old, so finding out he's actually quite young gave me a shock. The tone in this book reminds me of a finger-wagging, stern English teacher.On the other hand, if you read each chapter carefully and do exactly as he says, your writing will definitely get better. No question.The small flaws that clutter the first few pages can ruin a book over its length. Usually they point to someone who isn't good enough at their craft, hence the name of the book.Removing them will do your writing a lot of good, however finicky they may seem at first.Experienced writers will gain little from reading this, though. Instead, I'd recommend Noah Lukeman's second book, The Plot Thickens."
3,The First Five Pages: A Writer's Guide to Staying out of the Rejection Pile,"Some good tips, but I don't know whether it offers the entire solution to the rejection pile!"
5,Simplistic logic,"This book is simplistic in its logical approach to writing. In succinct terms, the author explains the importance of making a quick impression. Excellent reference."
1,No reason to buy or read this book,"There isn't anything wrong with this book, except that it did not capture my attention. I bought it because its title attracted me and sounded true. Once I started reading it I had to skim and skip because I felt if I put it aside I would never come back. I spent about three hours reading every other paragraph, sometimes every other page.I can't pinpoint anything that makes the book unreadable or useless. Only I can't say it is worthwhile reading it. I am convinced there are much better books you can spend your money with. Also, there are better things to spend your time with."
1,The title's misleading.,"This book doesn't offer specifics on the finer distinctions that agents make when considering the rejection pile. It uses examples of horrible writing. As an aspiring writer, I would have rather seen work that was pretty good, but didn't make it because . . .And then the author (agent) could have provided specific constructive suggestions and techniques for writers to use to improve their craft.I didn't get much out of this book."
5,Like listening to an ideal friend.,"I felt, while reading ""The First Five Pages"" (and I do not mean that literally) that I was spending time with a kind, true, and wise friend. Somehow, although critical, I felt Mr. Lukeman was on my side. It seemed a very personal experience and I gained much from it."
1,If you don't know the difference between a comma and a semicolon,"or if you're in the sixth grade, you might need this book. Trite, silly, so basic and ridiculous, it's insulting. Maybe if it were the least bit well written, it might be sort of worth it. But, please, let me SHOW you rather than TELL you what I mean.The first sentence of chapter 4 (Comparison) reads: ""A picture is worth a thousand words..."" No, I'm not kidding. He wrote that. Then, I choose this from many, many examples of bad grammar, only because it's in the same paragraph: ""Comparison is one of the few devices that really put (sic) a writer's skill in the spotlight...."" Turn the page for this bit of poorly phrased wisdom: ""Bad or cliche comparisons jump off the page. They indicate imprecision or laziness in searching for the right picture....If a writer doesn't care enough about his work to paint precisely the right picture, why should the reader waste his time reading it?""My point. Exactly."
2,Verrrrrry Basic!,"Although parts of this book were a good review. Any writer who has spent much time in the craft will not find much new here. However, for novices just getting started, it could be very valuable and worth the read. The examples of bad writing the author offers are exteme (in the sense of being bad). Few writers, even novice, would write such tripe. If you are looking for ""Writing 101,"" look farther. This one is even simpler: ""Writing 22"" or so. I considered it a waste of time and money."
5,Must have,I'm about half way through this book and have already learned more than I knew there was to ask. A must have if you have written a book.
2,One sentence says it all?,"First sentence, third paragraph, chapter 1 (""Presentation""):""It is a shame that small - and easily preventable - surface errors can be determinants for an entire book, can premamaturely take you from being taken seriously."" Premamaturely??Okay, with some writers that would be intentional and humorous. Or it may be the publisher's fault. Unfortunately, this sentence also has a sample of the real problem. Anybody who uses a word like ""determinant"" when they're not writing about mathematics is more than a little bit pompous.This is not an easy or enjoyable book to read, and the advice seems to be pretty basic - more tips from Chapter 1 include ""don't send an agent the only existing copy of your story"" and ""realize that Stephen King will have less trouble selling his next book than you will selling your first one"". Gosh, really?"
3,Nothing New,"This book would be great for beginners, but for someone who has already read many 'how-to' books, there was really no new advice. It was interesting to read how agents think, but beyond that it was a lesson for new writers, citing mistakes that a seasoned writer would never make."
2,Have we all read the same book?,"There are some nuggets of helpful information here, but there is also an 'I'm an insider and you're not' tone that is not helpful, and the author's long-winded-essay format is difficult to trudge through. One far better choice is 'No More Rejection' (an unusually helpful publication from the not always reliable folks at Writers Digest) but there are plenty of others, too. Either seek a punchier, less judgmental, more 'try this and this' approach, or buy this and wish you'd saved your money for another ream of bright white 22 lb. paper on which to print your manuscript."
3,The First Five Pages-It's only just OK,"Short and a quick read. This book might work well, as a teaching tool, only for someone who is a real beginner. I felt most of the examples were too simple and aimed at the most basic errors a writer might make. If you have been writing for some time I would look for something that will help more than `The First Five Pages'.This book is entertaining but does not address the age old, how to get published, as well as many similar books. Many writers really want to know how to catch a publisher or an agent with the first five pages. This book shows what will certainly chase them off, but not what will catch them."
4,Good reading,For the experienced writer most of the material is already known. But it doesn't hurt to hear it all again! Not complicated. Down to earth advice.
4,Useful for the beginner,"This book has good guidance and some useful suggestions for exercises in it. I thought the advice on adjectives and adverbs (chapter 2), sound (chapter 3), comparisons (chapter 4), and showing versus telling (chapter 11) was presented very well.I agree with others that many of the examples given were too exaggerated (even if they might have been actual submissions) to be of much use. I found myself skimming or completely skipping most of the examples.Overall I found ""The First Five Pages"" to be a valuable and fairly concise read on the subject."
4,"An excellent, concise guide","As is often the case with the best educational resources, The First Five Pages contains little that is new--or should be new to any serious writer. What it does provide, however, is a logical and concise framework in which to hang a large number of related concepts and ideas. It's not really about just openings, of course, and is a useful enough addition the the education of the professional, if inexperienced, author.I can find only two points worthy of criticism. First, many of the examples are so obvious as to hold little utility. Second, he used the word ""Transudes"" incorrectly, where clearly he meant ""transmutes"" or ""transforms"" or something along those lines. These are minor points though, and more than made up for with brevity and coherence."
5,A must have for any writer!!,"I so loved this book. I have read it twice, and will keep it for a reference.Problems found in writing are grouped in chapters. I. preliminary problems: presentation, adjectives and adverbs, sounsd, comparison, style, II dialogue: between the lines, comonplace, informative, melodramatic, hard to follow, III. the bigger picture: showing versus telling, viewpoint and narration, characterization, hooks, subtlety, tone, focus, setting, and pacing and progression. Solutions are given to problems and exercises are presented at the end of each chapter."
5,Just get it already!!!,"No doubt the up and coming authors who invest in this book will help make this guy rich, but there's a reason it has been added to numerous university and school booklists. There's help to be gained on every single page, and nothing that can't be put to good use.Reading it is like uncommon common sense. Duuuhh!!! Why didn't I think of that???Because I don't have the years of textual and literary experience Lukeman does, that's why! Don't waste time reading reviews when what you need to be doing is sending for this book that is easy to read and reminds you why you wanted to write in the first place - because you love telling stories and holding peoples' attention. This little winner will tell you how to improve and help keep it right! It will expand your thinking and only serve to create a more viable MSS. At the end of the day, you want the dollars while you're ALIVE, don't you?Pick a winner. Pick THIS one."
2,"good songs, bad production","This album does have some great songs, and that AC/DC cover is an awesome choice for this band, but the production is terrible. All you get is vocals screaming at you and super loud cheesy guitar solos. There's a hint of a rhythm section in there so you can at least tap your foot to something, but overall, I'd rather see this band live. Hey, aren't they from Germanton, NC now? I saw that on their website. kinda funny"
3,"Fantastic track, but skip the remixes and go for album","This track is pure genius from Towa Tei, featuring lovely vocals and a great bossanova beat, but don't settle for this single. I now regret that I didn't purchase the album ""Future Listening,"" especially since it features more Bebel Gilberto and bossanova sounds. I give the track itself 5 stars, but this disc alone is rather poor... the remixes leave me cold and skipping over to the original version."
5,Ready for college? Buy this book!,"Years from now, you could look back on your first year of college as one of the best times in your life. With transparency, humor, and practical advice, Adam Erwin shows how to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
5,No Barney Allowed,"When I found out that Sara Hickman had put out a 'children's album' I had to buy it.At the time, my daughter was just moving into the toddler stage. Music often fills our home (luckily with my wife's voice--not mine). However, with Sara's infectious songs and the simple sing-ability of this CD the house fills with my voice as well.We have purchased this CD (along with ""Newborn"") for a family friend, and it has quickly become a favorite. Heck, even at our house 8 years later my daughter will pop out with the occasional song from this CD.A very enjoyable family album."
5,This cookbook (now my favorite) is full of fabulous recipes.,"I have never found a cookbook that has SO MANY excellent recipes. I have tried recipes from almost every category and everyone has been great. These truly are some of the most treasured recipes, just like the book advertises. You're missing ""a good find"" if you pass over this one!"
2,Disappointed,I am very disappointed in this book. No pictures and no down to earth recipes. I have fixed nothing from it as I can't find a recipe worth trying.
5,Historical cookbook!,This cookbook is not only filled with great recipes but is so interesting to read recipes from all over the country ! Junior League has always been known for their cookbooks and this one tops them all!
4,Historic research,"In nuclear physics, Niels Bohr made key discoveries about the nature of the nucleon-nucleon interactions, and of the overall model of the nucleus. Plus, in doing so, he invented many experimental techniques to investigate the nucleus. Most notably, perhaps, these often involved sending slow neutrons, that would be likely to be captured by a nucleus, which might thence possibly undergo fission, Or perhaps emit electrons, positrons or gamma rays.All this is covered in this historically important text. Written with the help of a co-author, Bohr explains his research in an elegant and understandable manner. Of course, the book also goes into the war years, when he was spirited away to the Manhattan Project, in which he made large contributions.Researchers and students of nuclear physics should enjoy reading of the early years in their field."
5,NAVAJO CODE TALKERS BOOK,"THIS WAS A VERY GOOD BOOK, I THINK THESE MEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY DID FOR OUR COUNTRY LONG AGO."
4,Navajo Code Talkers,An amazing story about an operation that was kept secret for years. I doubt that any enemy today could break this code.
4,Navajo Code Talkers,"I thought this book was very informative with a lot of little known facts about the war in the Pacific. It was a documentary, but it could be a very interesting novel."
3,A Return to Honor,"This story continues the exploits of Archers Avengers. The Avengers are ordered to the planet Odessa in order to convince Snord's Irregulars not to renew their contract with Katrina Steiner in the hopes of helping Victor regain control of the splintered FedCom. The storyline is predictable and Archer reminds me of the characters from the old BTech novel Ideal War with the introduction of the Knights of the Inner Sphere. We continue to see the growing conflict within the FedCom, but the last few BTech novels seem mostly filler rather than introducing pertinent elements into this storyline. Hopefully, we'll see some more plot development in the next few novels as it appears that the civil war storyline is winding down. Overall, a good read, but nothing too heavy. As always, I recommend some of the earlier Michael Stackpole novels for background of the FedCom"
5,Sweat,This is an up in your face book.It is 1 of my favorites out of the many battletech and mechwarrior books.The Whole book is action packed.I read it again and again.
3,An Unusual Vampire Film,"Here we find Scott Valentine playing a vampire who goes out searching for somebody who wishes to die when his bloodlust finally gets so strong he can't put off killing any longer. This time he chooses a [prostitute] who seems to be at the end of her rope. As it turns out, the [prostitute] is more than a handful and a bizarre friendship is born. At the end of the night, one of them will end up with a new will to live and one of them will die . . . but which one will live? It's and engaging film if you like the brooding type of vampires and it's set in modern times. It's certainly not of the caliber of some of the better known films in the genre but I'd nonetheless recommend it for your vampire film collection."
5,"Nice, very nice.","Okay, so it's not Romeo and Juliet, but it's not the worst vampire porno I've ever seen, that would be Vamp (For the love of Corman, why would anyone cast Grace Jones as a stripper?!?)"
3,A sleeper of a film,"This film is more brooding than bloodletting. A vampire with Angst decides to tell his woes to a beautiful Charile (are they real?) Spralding (she's just as beautiful in Meridian: Kiss of the Beast).He's about to bite her, then tells her of his woes. Then he's just about to bite her, & he decides he's a few more woes to tell about. This continues for the rest of the film till they finally 'do it' in a scene that I beleive is only PG-rated.It must be tough to be a vampire. It was tough watching this film."
1,low budget boring remake,"this movie is a low(er) budget remake of a surprisingly good movie called ""Dance of the Damned"" The original, which does sport a couple of vintage 1980s styles such as a vampire with a mullet, had real chemistry and some very good dramatic acting. This movie appears to have a lower budget, and worse acting with no chemistry between the main characters."
5,best yet,"Purchased a few weeks ago, and am completely satisfied. we drill concrete to depths of 18"" for our company, and this drill is the most powerful we have seen. saves time, and was priced well. plan on purchasing 2 more this week."
3,How can a 4 CD set only have 12 songs? Something's screwy here.,"I do NOT own this set, so ignore the rating. This version is listed as having FOUR CDs, but there are only 12 songs listed.Someone that owns it, please supply the correct information. Thanks."
4,A nice change of pace for Lowe,"If he was only known as a producer, Nick Lowe would still be legendary. His work on early albums by Elvis Costello and Graham Parker (among many others) helped define thinking man's punk. Fortunately, he's also a wonderful singer/singwriter, albeit a relatively overlooked one. ""The Convincer"" shows Lowe sliding into middle age with grace and confidence. The songs here are loose and laid-back. ""Homewrecker"" opens this disc beautifully. ""Cupid Must Be Angry"" is gorgeous. The sparse arrangements give the songs a stark atmosphere, showcasing their beauty.While not as good as classic Lowe releases like ""Labour of Lust"" (an album which you should buy immediately if you haven't already), it's a perfect picture of 21st century Lowe...warm, intimate songs in a wonderful setting."
5,The convincer,"This is getting older with dignity. Every song is so fullfilled with soul, passion, sound and beauty. Play it twice a week and you have a cd to grow old together with. Do I like it? 6 stars out of 5!"
4,Another brilliant post-power-pop/punk recording,"I came of age loving Labour of Lust and Nick Lowe's other early records as the essence of pop-punk. But I can't think of another artist who has so seamlessly made the transition to a new genre, in his case, that of lounge singer/country troubador/crooner par excellence. I love this record and I love his album Dig My Mood even more. Great writing, great arrangements, and great singing. If you don't agree the first time you listen, give it a few more spins, and you'll be, uh, convinced."
2,"Weak, hollow","God bless Nick Lowe, but the first review really hits it on the head. If you are a fan of Impossible Bird and Dig My Mood, then this will appeal to you. Otherwise, you'll confirm for yourself that the great white light that was Nick Lowe has dimmed to a flicker. Nick, keep on kicking. One of them will get over the bar. Eventually."
5,The review below is extremely ignorant,This is a killer CD. For me it completes the finest trilogy in Mr Lowe's Career. Comments like the one below are very annoying and totally in error.
4,I am Convinced!!,"Nick Lowe has spent the better part of his career writing witty songs that make us all laugh at ourselves (or him). Over his last couple of albums he has slowly transformed into a crooner. He always has had a fine vocal sensibility but now he is down right soulful. At first listen these songs tend to be somber and downtrodden but after a few times it really has grown on me. I really enjoy the story telling and the sparse arrangements. Highlights for me are: ""Only a fool breaks his own heart"", ""Indian Queens"", and ""She's got soul""."
4,low-key charming stuff,"This is Nick the well-dressed, elegant charmer -- Nick the knife is long gone. No remakes of ""So It Goes"" or ""Marie Provost"" here; he sticks close to the torchy, country- and soul-derived crooning of *Impossible Bird* and *Dig My Mood.* This is an album of mellow pleasures, for better or worse. Its fairly soundalike, and a few of the songs seem slight, but the band and Lowe are in great spirits.Strangely, this record picks up considerably on the second side -- special highlights for me include Johnny Rivers' ""Poor Side of Town,"" ""Bygones Won't Go,"" ""Lately I've Let Things Slide"" and of course, the damn-near-perfect love song ""Let's Stay in and Make Love."""
3,Unusual,"A wellmeaning but pompous nebbish sets off on a disastrous trip with his hellish family (nymphomaniac wife, religious freak daughter and delinquent son). His misadventures pile on like an early Charley Chaplin's. It's kind of an updated ""Diary of a Nobody."" These comparisons are the problem, because when you read ""Diary of a Nobody"" (or watch an early slapstick comedy movie) the hundred year old jokes are funnier. Originality is the soul of wit. The updating consists of adding a lot of sex and violence, which doesn't bother me so much because of any puritanical beliefs but because it is gratuitous and indicates that the author could not think of any better way to update. The ending rather suggests that he ran out of ideas other than escalating the violence.The definitive updating of ""Diary of a Nobody"" has yet to come."
4,Attention--demented cat lovers,"This is your CD. I just heard a friend's copy and laughed so hard I had tears running down my face. No Irish drinking song is sacred to this crew.If you like cat songs and crazy parodies are you thing, this is a CD you will want to own. And yes, I do think it's listenable beyond the first novelty value."
5,A must for any cat lover,"I found this cd by mistake and it was the best mistake I ever made. Not only is it beautifully done, the songs are great and addictive. Once was not enough in listening to it. Marc Gunn is a very talented musicain and makes you see what he is singing. My cat's also love listening to this cd."
2,Quite poor as children's literature,"I know that this book has tapped into the child-illness market, and if it has served a useful function there, that's great.But as a piece of children's literature, it's pretty dreadful. There's no real cadence to the verse, the flow of the story makes no sense, from ancient castle to modern life (our message to homeless people should not be for them to just laugh?) and it's really unclear why anything happens. Why has the king lost the ability to laugh? How is it that he gets it back?As a Mom who has read countless books to her three children and to nieces and nephews galore, I can only report that neither I nor the couple of kids I read this story to was engaged. I should say ""tried to read it to,"" because they lost interest before we reached the end. My view of this book is that it's something everyone THINKS is supposed to be good, especially because of the sad story of the young man who wrote it."
3,"An important theme, but a little off target for me","I think the goal of this book was to imply that sometimes we have to find happiness within ourselves. I'm sure this is a challenging theme to convey. Kudos to David Saltzman for taking this on.For me, rather than conveying the theme, the book seemed to imply that there was something wrong with the King, the homeless man, the crowd on the streets, etc. since they weren't laughing and having a good time. I explained to my daughter that there are times to laugh, to cry, to be happy, to be afraid, etc. and that this is a good thing(esp. when we get to the girl in the hospital page). I also thought it was important to point out that we need to be sensitive to other peoples' feelings. In summary, the observational tone about all the other characters overshadowed the journey of self discovery the jester made about being happy within himself."
1,"awful, awful, awful","I'm just going to quote another review on the site, because I don't want to be redundant and this says it all:This is absolute worst juvenile book that I've ever seen. Besides the obvious politically correct messages, the plot is just plain silly. I mean, where in the heck did this guy come up with a jester and a talking piece of wood?! At any rate, unless you want to laugh AT it (you certainly won't laugh with it), I wouldn't even suggest taking the short time necessary to read it, much less buy it."
5,Great doll. Discontinued.,Classic Madeline Doll. No longer found in stores. Every girl should have this doll!
3,A World History Teacher reviews the book in search of great historical fiction for his class to read.,"I am in a quest to find a sizable number of hisorical fiction titles to use in my class. I bought this book in the hope of adding it to my classroom collection, and I will do just that. However, I also was hoping to be able to enthusiastically recommend it, as I have been able to do for many other titles. That I cannot do.I have no problem with the historical details of the book. Rather, I was unimpressed with the writing. It tended to drag and be a bit repetitive. Reluctant readers will be turned off.I was also expecting more about Joan of Arc. Instead, we are treated to a fictional female friend named Gabrielle who wants to be a midwife and doctor that follows Joan to the battlefield (the Dove, to Joan's sword - thus the title).So, it joins my collection, but I will only be recommending it to those specifically interested in Joan of Arc, rather than as a general recommendation."
4,VERY INTERESTING TWIST TO JOAN OF ARC'S LIFE,"This was a very interesting book. It showed the realness of life during war through the eye's of Joan of Arc's childhood friend, Gabrielle. At times the book could be confusing, but overall, this is a page-turner."
3,an okay book!!,"This book isn't the best I've read. I picked this book up at the library because I adore Joan of Arc and I have studied her in school. This book isn't from Joan's point of view but from Gabrielle, a girl from Joan's village who was on a pillgramage with Joan's mother when she decided to follow Joan. She is now Gabrielle, a boy and page. This book gets more interesting because there is romance between Gabrielle and a boy she met at a convent? who also decided to follow Joan and become a soldier. What really made me angry about Joan's story is King Charles. She helped him become king and he (being the spineless weakling that he is) didn't help Joan when she was captured by the Burgundians. If you like Joan of Arc, watch the movie with Leelee Sobeinski!!"
3,Way overrated!,"I was really excited to use this book in Amsterdam, and I must say, I was definitely disappointed with it. It wasn't very detailed on the more traditional items, and we didn't even enjoy a couple of the coffeehouse selections.Though I do agree with the reviewer who said that this book is great for vegetarians. My friend and I both eat meat, but the food suggestions were really wonderful. And the Maoz, a falafel chain, in the Albert Cuyp Market is incredible! Best value on our trip!But overall, I'd stick with one of the more traditional books and only purchase this as a secondary guide."
4,User friendly and informative,"This book tells it like it is. Easy matter of fact reviews of all facets of the city of Amsterdam. Shows you how to have fun whether you are a ""backpacker"" or a tourist. Inside tips are helpful."
2,More for Hippies...,"Not a bad book at all! I am not a hippie though. If you are, which is perfectly great, this is the book for you! It is all about finding the best deals and an honest review on all hotels, hostels, restaurants, night life and of course ""coffee houses"" hee hee!"
2,Better Books can be found,"For the price this book leaves much to be desired. It's worth maybe half the price considering much more informative books can be had for a little more.It's very amatuerish looking, with very few B&W only pictures."
1,worthless drivel,WE got this book when planning our trip to amsterdam and if we had listened to half of what the author had to say we probably wouldn't have enjoyed the city as much as we did. he has you believe that you'll be walking through blue haze all the time and wading through condoms. there's a lot more to Amsterdam than the drugs and sex. we trashed our guide because no one we met wanted it....don't waste your money.
5,"Great guide to ""alternative"" Amsterdam","If you're interested in the smoking side of visiting Amsterdam, this is the best book I have seen. While this is certainly not the only guide you should read before your trip, it is a damn good one. It's advice on the best coffee shops was mostly right on the mark, and the best deals and highest quality were had at his recommended shops. In summary... if you're a toker, pick up this joker! :-)"
3,Good if you're a Vegan/Vegetarian,"This is a great book if you like to smoke or are a vegan/vegetarian. It must list every coffee shop in Amsterdam and every Vegan/Vegetarian restaurant around. Not too many restaurants listed with normal food. If you're looking for sights to see and touristy stuff, stick with Frommers. Not too much mentioned about the red light district either. Like I said if you like to smoke this book is for you. If you're looking for info on museums, hotels, or restuarants besides vegan/vegetarian look elsewhere."
4,good quality,"Better build quality than I expected for the price. (Got it to split the ""master"" outlet in an auto-switching power bar, so that either of two devices could power on the TV and speakers. Ideally would be a bit shorter, since it just increased the lengths of cables to manage.)"
3,It works ...,"It works just fine, but it seems a bit ""cheap"" in the construction. I have no hard evidence and data to base this off of, but just the overall look and feel of the cord seem cheap compared to others that I have. I only have 2 very lower power devices hooked up to it, so I am not worried about any electrical issues."
2,polarized plugs...couldn't tell from the picture..visually impaired,I bought 2 and since the user is visually impairedwe didn't read this fact(polarized) in the item description.Not everyone can see what the product picture looks like.Tried to do a return and they didn't allow it to be returned.
4,Worked as it should!,"Not much to say other than it worked well, does help the small lenght and you can add one more component to your power bar."
1,Useless for outdoors,"Nothing in the description said that it should not be used outdoors, but when it came, the package clearly stated that it should never get wet, and should not be used outdoors.Totally useless to me, but not worth the trouble of returning it."
5,I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM,"I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM BUT WILL KEEP IT ANYWAY, TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO SEND BACK FOR A REFUND."
1,DEFECTIVE! MISWIRED! SAFETY HAZARD!,"I bought four Y adapters from this seller, two of this ASIN (B000234UFG) and two of ASIN B000FPQO9Q. The four adapters are identical in appearance and have the same defect (described below), so the seller in my case definitely used a common make & model to fulfill orders for both ASIN's.All four Y adapters are consistently miswired: Each connects the plug's HOT blade to the receptacles' NEUTRAL slots and the plug's NEUTRAL blade to the receptacles' HOT slot. This presents a genuine, 2nd-order safety hazard.I discovered the defect on the first of the four adapters the hard way: by getting shocked! For the other three, I used a test meter to confirm that they were likewise miswired."
1,VERY BAD: neutral and hot sides are reversed!,"Be careful: This product has the 'neutral' and the 'hot' sidesreversed. Meaning, the receptacle is NOT following the specof a normal wiring. This could be very dangerous depending onwhat you use this with."
4,Wiring Is fine,"I've checked the wiring when I received it with an ohmmeter, and the terminals are correctly wired on the one I ordered. It works fine for powering up 2 units to one plug as long as you don't exceed the amperage rating of the single plug."
5,Perfect When You Don't Need a Power Strip,"When you need that one extra outlet for a; phone charger, console plug in, laptop, Gaems PGE. If it is on the other side of the room you will have cords everywhere that you could step on and inevitably unplug. This is the perfect cable for people who need just one more outlet and nothing more."
1,exploring new horizons out of our minds,"I expected breathtaking pictures of nature and really something out of the ordinary.All I saw were the creators of the movie one after another talking what they did and how they felt,being in your face the whole time.They created a movie about themselves in a way."
2,MURDEROUS PIXEL,"OBSERVATIONS ON THIS MOVIE:*It's way too long and can't sustain suspense or interest for such a length.*A preposterous plot that never comes near to being credible.*Peter Gallagher's character is entirely unlikeable; he does one stupid thing after another and is unfair to both his wife, Mimi Rogers, and the siren Juliet Spring (Bridgette Nelson Sampras).*Why would anyone not see how manipulative and selfish Nelson's character is?*The scene where Mimi Rogers throws the head is either intentionally or unintentionally hilarious.Director Mick Garris usually does better work (he's done many of the Stephen King tv adaptations) than this.Worth a rental if you have two and a half hours you can't possibly find anything better to do with."
2,i wanted juliet to win,"*** spoilers ahead *** as somebody else has already commented on, peter gallagher's character was beyond weak. if i'm ever asked to do a director's cut on this the end of the movie would be juliet destroying doofus head and his lamo family for 20 minutes and then blowing up the entire city as punishment for being crap. also, they overplayed the character in the wheelchair and his longing to be free!?!? big time. the message seemed to be if you're in a wheelchair even if you've got a great job and great friends then you're life is incomplete and should be escaped from at the first opportunity - crass and dumb. just to add salt to the wounds apparently when juliet uploads she is no longer who she once was - she is a pale copy, a chimera and this existential knowledge helps to destroy. however when wheelchair boy uploads it is beautiful and has made him ""free"" and complete and better than he was. meh."
5,Excellent,I'm at the top of comfort use it . I used it before and I lost my connects between camera and Tripod That's why I bought new one
4,Highly Recommended,The human body is wonderfully designed with built in resources for healing itself. I bought this with the intention of activating the chi and achieving optimum fitness. This DVD contains two programs.There is a standing routine which takes about 50 minutes to do. That is my one criticism of this program. It is overly long. There is also a sitting routine which is about 30 minutes long. This is preferable. My one criticism notwithstanding i do recommend this to anyone who is interested in natural healing without medications and their god awful side effects.
5,Great job.,I've been waiting for the update on the timeline since Adventures in Space and Time was released. It was well worth the wait.
4,Voyages of Imagination: The Star Trek Companion,Every serious Star Trek fan should have this book. It's interesting and fun.
1,CAUTION!!!,"This product is advertised as PS2 game wheel, IT IS NOT! This store is GREAT! Took a return and I ordered the proper wheels. This is a great company to work with. These wheels are only compatable with computer games."
3,Might not be for PS2,"I found this listed as a driving controller for the PS2, but the manual looks like it was made only for PCs. Double-check before you buy for PS2."
1,WAY TO BASIC,This is a waste of time and money. Noting that you cannot learn on the web for free and no good advice for the consumer.
3,Enjoyed it,"My reaction falls between the two extremes here -- I enjoyed it and have enjoyed re-listening to the CD several times. Much is derivative (like the wonderful Brothers-Four style ""The Man Who Wouldn't Sing Along with Mitch"") Very interesting to hear them before they hit the right material and format. And enjoyable on its own."
2,Sum much better than parts,"Wow....was I disappointed by this disc. As a devout Mamas and Papas fan, it is hard to describe how bad this disc is. The covers by The New Journeymen are laughable and should have remained unreleased. The good stuff on this disc is available on either the double disc best-of-set or other CD's. There is one interesting moment, the cover of ""Tom Dooley"" sounds exactly like Bananarama's cover of ""Venus"". nuff said. Completists only."
1,game,"i got the package but my uncle already bought me this, when returning it i have never got my refund, nor i got a message. plus there was no way to contact them. do not buy it at all nor waste your time looking at it. thank god i have money still but never will buy it no more unless i get my refund to erase all this and start some thing new."
3,so-so.,"Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right."
3,A Decent Game,"This game is a decent game. The up side is it's pretty easy to play and you get to blast the bad guys like most the other shoot 'em up games. The different twist is you do it from a Humvee. You do have to figure out how to play as you go because there aren't really any instructions. The graphics are good. It's a decent middle of the road game. If you want to get a little aggression out and just blast something without harming anyone in real life, take it out on the baddies in this game."
1,Suck,I didnt like these. I thought they would do the job but instead they are a pain in the behind to use. I would not recommend these. Instead i replaced these with the datashark 70029. I love it.
5,"GREAT MOVIE ,FANTASTIC MUSIC SCORE","MUCH BETTER THEN THE COLOR OF MONEY,TOM CRUISE IS NOT A GOOD ACTOR.FANTASTIC MUSIC SCORE BY KENYON HOPKINS ON SAX.IS THE MUSIC AVILABLE ON CD."
5,The Hustler-Great Movie.,"The movie is a timeless classic. It was Paul Newman's breakout role and Jackie Gleason's performance as Minisota Fats is flawless. Other standout performances are Piper Laurie as Newman's ""girl"" and Geroge C. Scott as the slimey promoter. It's great to see this movie in all it's glory again, I recommend it highly!!!"
5,The Hustler,"My husband really likes this movie, but he doesn't like the widescreen version of it, which is what we ordered. We had to send it back, but I'm sure we will find one that is the regular screen version, and order that one."
3,"Good acting, weak story","The Bottom Line:Newman and Scott are very good but the story is overlong and achingly familiar (bigshot player loses first big bout of whatever sport due to overconfidence/personal demons, goes through a learning process, wins big match in end) and the hard edge of the screenplay can't quite make up for the often obvious nature of the plotting and character development; it's an ""American Classic,"" but quite a flawed one.2.5/4"
3,4:3 aspect on blueray?,"Isn't this filmed 4:3 aspect ratio? Why buy Blueray? I've never heard a good argument for buying pre-sixties films in 4:3 on a 16:9 capable media.Anybody, Bueller, Bueller?"
3,3in a half stars ...,well this quick ....magically spell myself to make this come out right an well understood ...a superiotious afi the past week made mwwe me exited it was spicy an full of flare an well educated with wisdomatic creativetyan showed the higher learning processes of posteritied solutions 333 ...ps i never can recall anyomne else saying that surprizingly enough that even if you beet me im still the best .... to me pauls greatest lines he ever said that i remember well ....she was so plain an observant in her role as well from what i canm remember truly agree with the rating afi gave ...shdfh ...
4,Great Black and White Video,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.Aspect Ratio: approximately 2.35:1 (it looked more like 2.30:1).Audio: DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio. Good.Video: Black and white. Very good.Length: 2 hours 15 minutes.Overall, a good Blu-Ray purchase."
5,MEMORIES,"RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT QUICKLY AND WATCHED IT THE VERY FIRST NIGHT. i BELIEVE THE BLU-RAY VERSION WAS EXCELLENT. MY WIFE AND I ARE IN OUR SEVENTIES AND WOW, THIS YEAR THEY MADE ANOTHER B/W MOVIE AND IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF OSCARS TOO. LOVED WATCHING jACKIE AND NEWMAN ACT ONCE AGAIN."
4,Good movie for any Paul Newman fan,"The movie was rather slow, but I still enjoyed watching it, especially knowing that there was as sequal that was filmed and took place 30 or 40 years later. The DVD was of good quality."
5,The Hustler - Still a classic,"What else can you say? Paul Newman as the fallable Eddie Felson, Jackie Gleason as the great Minnesota Fats....even a cameo by billiards legend Willie Mosconi brings back memories of an era long since gone. If you haven't seen this (perhaps living in a cave), you must!"
5,The Basics...,"A Classic. Who doesn't know about it. The lines, the characters, the acting... evrything is top notch. JTS Brown,""I'm gonna beat you fat man, I'm the best there's ever been.""""Stay on him Fats, this kids a loser."" ""The game isn't over until Fats says it is."""
4,The Hustler Bluray Book,Paul Newman is icon of hollywood so make this movie so special. With this edition 50th Anniversary in digibook so special. This movie presented in black and white but transfer in bluray not quite good to soft but it's clear 3.5/5 .. audio DTS HD 5.1 average for drama movie and feature 5/5 and Fox very good for this supplement
5,Great Movie,Great movie which explains the Color of Money much better. Watched both movies and enjoyed them both. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Paul Newman
2,A Eurocentric view of India,"This book is, like most other books on India, a Eurocentric view of the subject. It's shortcomings have been well documented by Dilip Chakrabarti, the archaeology professor at Cambridge University, in his seminal book COLONIAL INDOLOGY."
5,wow,"wow exact replacement for my application, price was a little high but they know i needed it. very well wraped"
5,"Funny, charming and unique childrens book.","This book was wonderful. After Charlie Roach is squooshed, Inspecter Cricket interviews the seedy bug characters in Bugtown. As I read this book to my children, all I could think was how much fun the authors must have had writing it. We even had fun with the buggy eyes!"
1,"Was to be a gift however missing parts ""wiggle Eyes"" it was just a useless expence with no resolution","These books are great kids love them. What makes them so interesting and apealing to kids ~ Simple the Wiggle Eyes, this seller sent book without Wiggle eyes so this gift has no home back to square one. It's not the money that received one star but the abilty to sell misrepresentated products and then there would be no resolution."
5,Family Favorite!,"We have read this book in our house for 14 years now! With 4 children, it remains a favorite! It is so much fun to make the different voices for the bugs and the rhyming makes it easy to remember. Love, love, LOVE this book!"
5,kiddie records,"Had a copy of this when i was a kid and lost it for years, Now i have it back in my collection of vinyl records."
5,Terriffic first layer,"This thing isn't just for women! Super first layer when riding the motorcycle in the spring & fall. Convenient, too. The design works great for both genders. They are rugged and wear like iron. Shop for comparable ""male"" products and all you'll find is cheaper made and a lot more money!"
3,Opaque? Really??,"For a bodystocking, it's fine. For opacity, not even close; I have to wonder if they know the meaning of the word. Completely unstretched, it's still see-through (although not well). Worn, you can read through it."
1,Strictly amateur,This is some of the most pantywaisted music I've ever heard. I'm sure there's a big future for these losers at McDonald's when they finish high school. Don't even think about wasting your money on this tripe.
4,Wait Just Wait.,"While the lyrics are incredibly juvenile, even for a twelve year old and a fifteen year old, and the lead singers voice does make you cringe a little, The Moss Brothers don't act their ages in the instrument department. (In a good way.) The guitar play is quite impressive for twelve, even if the vocals aren't and I gurantee in three or four years, when the kid goes through puberty, and they step up the songwriting, they'll be a group to look out for."
5,Great Unique New CD--Kids Rock!,"This CD is fabulous--totally original and rocking. These kids are tremendously talented. And, of course, having Jason Newsted on the bass is the best."
4,Dictionary of 501 Spanish Verbs fully conjugated in all the tenses,"This was a really great reference book when I needed assistance on conjugating a word, I may have forgotten. However, there are newer words that are not in the book but that is okay because of the familiar patterns from other words used prior to that."
1,Kindle version is horrible,It's almost impossible to search for individual verb conjugations on the Kindle version of this book. Don't buy it.
1,Warning great book but not for Kindle,"This is a great hardcopy reference book I own that is worse than useless in its electronic format. Because little consideration was given to the book's conversion the Kindle version is almost impossible to use. The title of the book says 501 Spanish verbs. Since the verbs aren't set up with linked references there is no way to jump quickly to a selection. Sure the TOC lists about 50 but what about the other 451? I for one don't want to thumb through page after page looking for them. Even worse there is an appendix that lists 2,100 other verbs that conjugate like those in the book; in the hardcopy each listing is followed by a page number, in the Kindle version there is no reference back to the text! I understand that Amazon wants to offer as much content as possible for the Kindle, but a conversion that might be acceptable for a book like ""Treasure Island"" produces junk when applied to a book like this one."
5,great reference,"This book is good, it gives u alot of verbs fully conjugated and with a CD that helps you learn with it."
5,Barron's Foreign Language Guides: 501 Spanish Verbs ( Book & CD- ROM),I loved this book. It made learning Spanish much easier than I expected. The book and CD- ROM was in execllent condition and ready to use. I would recommend using this seller. A ++++.
3,501 spanish verbs,This book is an essential reference for anyone who is studying Spanish. I have the paper edition on my shelf and use the Kindle edition along with translation dictionaries while traveling. My only problems with the Kindle edition are that the text refers to page numbers making it difficult to optimize its use. Also the book is hard to search effectively. For instance if you want to search for the verb IR you get results for all the instances the text refers to verbs ending in ir.
3,Not Great for Students; Use the Web,"I bought this book when I was learning Spanish because so many people recommend it. However 501 Spanish isn't a great book for students. It might be fine as a desk reference but for most students conjugating every verb correctly isn't essential. Instead the focus should be on learning to USE the language not memorize verbs or relying on a reference book. In addition, for those who are interested in verb conjugations, websites like [...] make looking up conjugations a snap, not to mention they are free and a lot more that 501 verbs."
1,Kindle Version Unusable,"Having read so many great things about this book, I was very excited to get into it and really get working on verbs. I was also looking forward to being able to cart it around with all my other books via my Kindle.Unfortunately, like so many other language books, this one is not ported well. In fact, I would have to say it's worse than many others, as the tables are put together in image files which are too small to read, even when expanded.I'm still waiting for a publisher of this type of book to get serious about the Kindle and really translate their work over to a format that the reader can use."
1,Great book but not for Kindle,"I purchased the Kindle to put this book and other reference books on it for travel. The 501 Verbs does not work on the Kindle. The pages with the conjugated verbs function like a picture on the Kindle, so you cannot increase the size of the type (and it is VERY tiny) and when you search for a verb it only gives you references that are in sentence use and not the page that the full verb conjugation in on. The Kindle may be good for reading a traditional book from front to back, but it is frustrating to use with reference materials. I returned the book, as I have it in paperback, and I may end up returning the kindle as it is not going to meet my needs. From what I read, the Spanish-English dictionaries are also of poor quality, even though at least one can now be integrated. I am sure the technology is difficult to establish with the level of sophistication and responsiveness that I would like, but this does not do it."
3,Needs improvement,"Hi I am a Spanish language student. I bought this book for my Kindle and got a refund for the following reasons. 1) where the print is blue in the actual book it did not scan well on the Kindle and is very faint so it is hard to see; 2) letters on verb lists on the left sides are cut off (generally the first letter of each word only); and 3) you cannot enlarge any verbs or words on verb lists as the Kindle does not allow larger fonts for tables. I really need this book so I called Amazon customer service and they said sometimes publishers fix these problems in a month or so. I will be checking back if you want this book for your Kindle download the sample and see the issues like I did and then tell Amazon your complaints and maybe we can get this book fixed so we can have it on our Kindles. It is a great book in paperback form as most of you already know, it would just be great to have it on our Kindles. Thanks,J"
1,Kindle Edition is Worthless...Don't buy it,"The Electronic version of this book should be withdrawn from the catalogue. One star is too high a rating.Going to language schools in Mexico, I always bring along a Spanish Verb book and dictionaries. Having just bought a Kindle, I set about getting e-book versions. The Merriam-Webster dictionaries are a joy to use; but Barron's 501 verb e-book is useless. The paper text has been merely copied with no adaptation to the electronic medium. There is no look-up mechanism: You cannot search for a verb. References in the text give page numbers without relation to LOCATION or any way to get there. Finally the tables for each verb are rendered as images with illegible minuscule characters and some characters missing on the left margin.Basically, I'm just repeating what all previous E-version reviewers have said. I just hope that our negative reviews get listed near the top to prevent others from buying the E-Book version."
1,Kindle Edition is Useless,"I have well worn copy of the physical volume which is invaluable. The Kindle version is worthless. The verb tables are too fine print to read and cannot be changed. You cannot search for a verb. Since the verb tables are pictures and not text the search feature does not recognize them, what utility is there in paging through 700 pages to get to a table you cannot read. Also the header of the verb table is on one page and the conjugations are on the next. The publisher should refund the price of this e-book."
2,Content is great but not really searchable,I like 501 Spanish Verbs. It is very useful for looking up verb conjugations. Spend a little more and buy the paperback or hardcopy versions. The Kindle version is very portable but all the verbs are not searchable. There are links for the 55 most commonly used verbs in the table of contents but not for the rest. I think that the Kindle version would be greatly improved if links were added to the table of contents for all 501 verbs in the book.
5,Excellent CD-ROM Exercises,"I'm not sure I'll ever learn all 501 verbs, but the CD-ROM exercises are enjoyable and very helpful. I wish more of the verbs had been translated into English equivalents. The examples in the front of the book were helpful, but I could use many more."
3,"Useful, but not complete","As a student re-learning Spanish not used for too many years, I looked forward to having a copy of 501 Spanish verbs. The book is complete in that it conjugates all of the verbs for you, but I found it limited in its description of what all the tenses are -- for example, what is pluperfect subjunctive? I don't even know what that means in English. The dictionary was also moderately helpful, but I think I will have to look for another text to provide a more robust vocabulary and explanations of the listings. Perhaps I set my expectations too high, as the title does reflect the content accuratly."
5,Experience God like never before!,This book totally holds the key to effective and fulfilling praise and worship. It is totally scripture based and gives the perfect example of a God-filled life! I hate reading but have been lost in this book! I definetly recommened it to ANYONE who wants to seek God even further!
5,THE PURPOSE AND POWER OF PRAISE,VERY OUTSTANDING BOOK TO GROW SPIRITUALY WITH ENJOYING IT TO THE UPMOST. WILL BE HELPFUL IN TIME TO COME IN MY CHURCH. I BOUGHT IT FOR MYSELF AND I'M ENJOYING IT VERY MUCH GREAT BOOK AND SELLER. THANKS
5,Still the best,"I just bought some new computer speakers today and, of course, I had to bring out the best reference CD of all time. I bought Tricycle in the mid 80's and feel very fortunate to have listened to them for all these years. This is a hard CD to classify, but if you love music in general, jazz or you just want to see how good your stereo/speaker system really is, I dare you. The dynamic range is still jaw dropping today. An amazing landmark piece of work produced on day one of the digital age."
4,Good House CD,"I bought this CD after experiencing the Gen.Trance 2000 cd. It wasn't really what I was expecting (trance), but it's really good house; just like it says on the cover. If you're into house, it's definitely good. Flows very well. If your looking for trance and don't have the Gen.Trance 2000--get that one first. It'll blow you away."
3,Heachache,The first track gave me a headache and put me off listening to the rest of the cd.. it improves towards the end.. but probably best to save your cash!
5,MORE CAKE PLEASE,"This album has not let me down. I first experienced cake like alot of people with Prolonging the Magic, loved it and went and bought the previous cd's and loved them. Ive been a total cakehead ever since. I love the lyrics esp. pretty pink ribbon (brilliant and hillarious) you hear something new everytime, sometimes it makes you laugh sometimes it makes you cringe but it always makes you want to listen to it again. While it is full of the familiar cake trademarks like the rattle snake sound and the ""oh yeahs"" and ""all rights"" this cd was refreshingly new with a whiff of guitar influence from the cars on love you madly and a little more harmony in other places. LOVE IT!BUY IT FOR SURE!"
3,"Still cake, but clearly short some key ingredients","Comfort Eagle is still clearly Cake, and the sound is as unmistakably unique as it's always been. This album lacks the punch of past efforts, however. Most fans regard Fashion Nugget was the best work Cake has ever done, but since then, whether due to departing members, or other factors, their sound has dulled somewhat. You won't find much in the way of the amazing country tinged work Cake used to do on Comfort Eagle. You won't find the songwriting to be as diverse either. There are no tangos or waltzes on this album, just Cake's particular brand of pop /rock. That's not to say the album is a misstep though. There are still many great Cake moments on Comfort Eagle, but it seems like the unpredictable and erratic nature of Cake, formerly a defining characteristic of theirs, has fallen to the wayside in favor of a more formulaic approach. Oh well. Still good."
4,"Wow! Original, funky, lyrical, rocking, and intelligent","Every now and then, an artist emerges who is so unusual and intelligent that they just cut through the noise of new product introductions that is today's pop music. If you like guitar music, you'll like this. If you like Prince, you'll like this. If you like Chumbawumba (and will admit it), you'll like this.McCrea is such a creative artist. Songs like Opera Singer and Commissioning a Symphony in C simply demand attention to the lyrics. Arco Arena and the way great Love You Madly are just great, short rock songs.The rest of the album is filled with clever, unusual cool songs. Easily one of the best is a while."
2,The magic is on vacation without a passport,"This album is two-dimensional compared to what came before it. Before, we had drifting lines that would be slightly behind or before the lead vocal, poetry from simple things and complex music made to sound simple; in short, it was what every music writer hopes for: unique and inspired music.This effort is just common and uninspired and fairly disapointing. I even hear some of the old lyric subjects! (Short Skirt/Long Jacket). When an artist becomes self-referencial, it means that it is time to move on. I really don't know who could not hear the difference but I certain do. Unlike the initial reviewer (Bill Forman), I don't get paid for writting nice things about this CD. I did lose money buying it though.I liked this group effort and hope that they recharge their batteries and not put out more stuff like this!"
5,CAKE is every bodys favorite band..its hard not to like them,i love this CD i listen to it everyday..they are the greatest band ever...this review is not going to help anybody..but i need to say one thing GO BUY THE CD!!!!!
2,Weakest effort since the first,"Too bad half the band went and formed Deathray. Each band is half as good as the past. Buy ""Prolonging the Magic"" and skip this one. Totally uninspired."
3,"Good, but doesn't meet expectations","This is a good CD, but it does not have the quality or ""edge"" of the last 2 releases. Every band has an ""off day"", so let's hope this is Cake's, in which case, not too bad for an ""off day""."
5,Who said they sold out to the man?,"Everyone complains Cake sold out after Motorcade of Generosity, and they can make a good case for it. Fashion Nugget and Prolonging the Magic were both great CD's, but didn't seem to have the quirky, unrefined freshness that Motorcade did, but their music matured and that made up for it. Now Cake has done something wonderous: they've taken their style, matured it, but stayed true to their original intent and made an absolutely fabulous CD, probably their best. You might want two, one for you and one to let your friends borrow."
4,a good comeback,"after making three albums, cake has come out with a new album after three years after the release, prolonging the magic. comfort eagle is cake's best cd yet, and short skirt/long jacket is being played on radio stations and has made it to mtv and vh1 with their video.with 11 new songs, though only barely over 36 minutes, comfort eagle is going to be their biggest release yet. pick up this cd, cause it's worth it."
4,"Not their best effort, but still a great CD.","I don't think this is the best Cake CD to date. The title track, Comfort Eagle is spectacular - ironic and interesting lyrics. The radio play cut, Short Skirt is OK, but not fantastic. But, for a true Cake fan, this is a must-by, because the evolution of the band is obvious."
4,read,"This album is much better that the last, but not as great as Fastion Nugget. This album was written by the same writer as all the other albums (John McCrea), but now has to conform the new members to his style and it still comes across great. The combination has worked in this latest CD. Cake has kept its ""sound/feeling"" and vocals even though the original guitarist has left the band. There are fantastic parts to this CD and what a relief to the cookie cuteness that I have come to expect in today's music. If I had to say though, ""Love Me Madly"" is very POP and so is ""Pretty Pink Ribbon"". So far I only listen to the first 8 1/2 songs with faith."
5,Vintage Cake,"Well, what else can I say? This album is just so fun to listen to. This group has survived losing 3 members and is still remains constant. From ""Opera Singer"" to ""Pretty Pink Ribbon"", this album is full of classic Cake. Favorites include, ""Opera Singer"", ""Short Skirt..."", ""Comfort Eagle"", and ""Long Line of Cars"". The other tracks are amazing in there own way, but these are just my personal fav's. If you are a Cake fan, this album is a can't miss. It reminds me more of ""Fashion Nugget"" than it does ""Prolonging the Magic"". Anyway, thats my opinion...enjoy!!"
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I have loved Cake since their first album, and I will continue to love them, but Comfort Eagle seems, at least at first listen, to be a bit disappointing. I find most of the songs on the album, especially the first several, to be sappy and lacking in that driving edge that made such songs as Rock and Roll Lifestyle, Hem of Your Garment, I Will Survive, and others great songs to me. Many of the songs simply fail to commit to any sort of hook. That being said, there are still several songs on the album which I found, even the first time, to be catchy and yet meaningful. Comfort Eagle, Short Skirt/Long Jacket, Arco Arena, and Commissioning a Symphony in C have that special Cake vibe made me a fan at age 11 and will keep me a fan for years to come. I'm not saying I don't like the album, but I do wish it had more exciting songs."
4,Awesome cake cd,"I actually wanted to give it about a 4-4.5 because it's not their greatest cd, but still--any fan would greatly appreciate it, such as I. I have been a fan since I heard Rock and Roll Lifestyle 6 years ago off of their Motorcade of Generosity cd. I would tell anyone who is new to Cake to buy the Fashion Nugget cd before getting this one, and invest in this one at a later date. I think the next single off of this cd is going to be either Love You Madly or Comfort Eagle <--nice guitar!"
4,Continous high quality from Cake,"I don't really know a whole heckuva lot about Cake, only that their music is great. I like their combination of intelligent/quirky lyrics, synth, percussion and horn hooks, and cool vocals. First got turned on to Cake based on ""Frank Sinatra"" and then started to explore further. Everything I listened to was great. Comfort Eagle continues this consistent high quality approach. Two songs really stand out to me: World of Two, and Short Skirt/Long Jacket. World of Two is, to me, prototypical Cake - lyrics, quirky programmed percussion touches, great vocals. I highly recommend this and other Cake CDs, and hope they come east to NY to play live."
4,they did it again,"this album to me isn't as good as prolonging the magic, but it is real close. It has a different sound to it but still has the undeniable Cake aura to it. Great lyrics once again. I got it yesterday and have listened to it about ten times and it keeps getting better."
5,Cake fans won't be dissapointed,"I'll admit right away that I had high expectations of this album. Cake is one of my favorite bands, and I listen to their previous 3 albums religiously(especially the second and third albums). So I had high hopes that Comfort Eagle would be just as good, or better. And it is! I once again like every single song on a Cake album. CE is full of head-boppin tunes and the music still has that ""vintage"" feel that many of the band's other songs have. My only gripe with the album is that there doesn't seem to be enough trumpets in it, and the trumpets are a Cake staple. But other than that this album is excellent and worth every penny, and then some. Buy it!!"
4,Worthy Of The Wait,"Cake have managed to defy many of the rumours that were flying around about them and produce another top class album (even with the departure of several members) My favourite tracks on the album are, Love You Madly, Shadow Stabbing, Meanwhile, Arco Arena and World Of Two. Any fan of Cake will love this album, as it has remained true to their style and it shows that more than person makes the band, and their quality shines throughout"
5,Another great Cake cd,"Another great album from Cake, this time with a little more synths and less tracks, but about the same total length. Songs that stand out are Shadow Stabbing, Short Skirt/Long Jacket, Arco Arena (an instrumental), and Long Line of Cars. All the other tracks are good too. I definately reccommend it if you liked their other albums, especially if you liked Prolonging the Magic."
3,Is Cake sliding?,"It was with great anticipation that I awaited this album. I've been listening to Cake for years, have all of their other releases and seen several live shows. This album is a disappointment.On all but a few tracks they've lost what kept me listening - great grooves. The lyrical content is still there along with some nice melody lines but the electronic drums suck. Period. In most cases they are just too thin to provide a solid foundation for the rest of the track."
3,Funny stuff-or at least weird,"Cake's back! Cake's back! Thank God, but this album only proves that they will never, ever make an excellent album-it's more of the same weird stuff from their previous three albums. It's all here-the guys yelling refrains in the background, John McCrea's constant refusal to sing well (or at all). Nonetheless, their songwriting is still funny-who would imagine McCrea as an opera singer (""Opera Singer"")? What's the deal with ""Short Skirt, Long Jacket?"" I don't know either. Still, this album's pleasant enough that you won't be disappointed when you listen to it. It's just a shame that the guys can't do anything better."
2,Cake's Worst...,"As a Cake fan ever since Fashion Nugget,i have to say that this is Cake's worst album above all previous albums!Their best album in my opinion is Fashion Nugget!I think the loss of talented members took it's toll on the band.Comfort Eagle lacks what other past Cake albums had,good lyrics with an awesome bassist and guitarist not to mention drummer(now gone)!So if your a old Cake fan,you might be disappointed with this latest offering.So lets just hope their next album will be way better than this.And hopefully next time they'll try and choose a less of a Mtv commercial route!Like why two Short Skirt/Long Jacket videos?I've heard better Cake songs than that one,big deal..."
2,Quasi-Intellctual Rock,"They no doubt have a unique sound, but the lyrics characterize what I call ""hyper-Rock Intellect."" Which is the quasi-intellectual expression of rebellion that contains no strong intellectual insight. They are rockers, therefore they rebel against conforming society; but to sing simple lyrics mocking a classical composer and opera singer sounds nothing more than childish and annoying- leaving me to believe there was no real intellectual thought put into these words (""Comfort Eagle"" being the only slight exception). They are one step above singing about how parents are so uncool. Sell on Cake, sell on."
4,"I can't believe that Elvis is dead, y'all","Wake up and smell the melting candle wax. Cake is the new world order. Cake is tomorrow. Cake represents all that is unblemished and true and just.Take heart, unbelievers, Cake champions the cause of freedom from oppression. Cake believes in you.Believe in Cake.Elvis is not dead, he's just been sleeping. Now he's producing. Bring the trumpets, herald his return. Do not despair in these times of dismall regurgitated music. Rejoice, for there is Cake."
3,"Good, but disappointing.","I've been a Cake fan since their Motorcade of Generosity debut (which remains their best CD to date). While Cake has always been a formulaic band, it's always been a *working* formula. Unfortunately, it gets tedious with Comfort Eagle. While a few songs certainly stand out about the rest (see: ""Opera Singer"", ""Comfort Eagle"" and ""Love You Madly""), the album is too short and definitely not up to par with Cake's previous work. The lack of any slower, sad songs (such as ""She'll Come Back To Me"", ""Sad Songs and Waltzes"" or ""Cool Blue Reason"") hurts the CD as well, as that's truly an area in which Cake excells. I'll agree with another reviewer that said though it isn't up to Cake's standards, it's still better than most ""music"" out there today. I simply think that compared to *previous* Cake, this is quite a let down."
4,Something is amiss,"This album is great, don't get me wrong. But there is something missing from this album. There is no immediate favorite track, there is no track that grabs me by the neck and spins me around until I'm dizzy. Again, it's all really good, and anyone who likes Cake should buy it... but in the history of Cake albums, I would not use this one to introduce the band."
4,A nice piece of cake.,"Solid effort from this typically off-beat, unique sounding group. If you're a fan of their music, this is definitely worth having in your collection."
4,"Meanwhile, Cake...","This album is awesome, has some great hits ""Love You Madly"", ""Short Skirt/Long Jacket"", has some innovative sounds ""Meanwhile, Rick James..."", ""Pretty Pink Ribbon"", ""Comfort Eagle"", but it has also dull songs like ""Long Line Of Cars"", has some strange songs ""Opera Singer"", ""Shadow Stabbing"" and it has a greaaat really great song ""Comissioning A Simphony In C"".In conclusion, this album is totally good, is cake's best and surely a must-buy"
5,They Haven't Lost Their Touch,"Although they've been through 3 albums already, the newest Cake album still sounds basically like the first. Most bands' sounds develop or change over the years, but Cake has managed to keep their good old sound. The background music has moved up a notch to more synthesized-sounding stuff, but they're still playing their bad plastic guitar strings and their lyrics still don't make any sense-- but that's what makes them good. As with most bands, hardcore fans usually favor the old albums over the new ones, but as a Cake fan, I can say that I can't even tell the difference between their old and new stuff-- and that just makes them that much better."
3,"He's Calling You ""Dude.""","The deadpan delivery and ""Mexican Radio""-like instumentation sometimes wear thin, but every once in a while Cake drops a bomb on you that is worth the wait.The H-bomb on COMFORT EAGLE is the title track, which fairly throbs with some kind of evil foreshadowing--""It is useless to resist us""--and the kind of keyboard parts usually reserved for Public Enemy records. It's particularly disturbing since Cake points their finger only at a guy with the annoying habit of calling people ""dude."" It's the kind of song that makes me think Cake may be listening to the Beastie Boys when nobody is looking."
5,Great Job,"Cake - what a group! If you like their previous stuff, this continues to be, in my opinion, even better. You can't go wrong with this one."
3,"Worst Cake yet, but......","Ok, I'm a huge fan of Cake and I probably got my hopes up for another ""Fashion Nugget"", and this album didn't meet those hopes. This is still a great album, better than 95% of what is out there on the radio, but it does lack some of the ""quirkiness"" that previous albums had and the music is starting to suffer a little from the massive defections the band has suffered. Is this album worth buying? Yes, if you're a long time and hard core Cake fan, but if you're just thinking about sampling some Cake for the first time, try ""Motorcade of Generosity"" or ""Fashion Nugget""."
5,Cake's long awaited CD is well worth it...,"Cake's Comfort Eagle is another gem to add to their treasure chest already present. After almost three years of waiting for all Cake fans as the band lost the drummer and changed record labels, Cake is back on top. This song is great for listening and having a great time singing to. ""Opera Singer"" opens the CD by warming the listener up for a wild ride. ""Meanwhile, Rick James..."" and ""Shadow Stabbing"" continue Cake's beautiful funk domination. ""Arco Arena"" introduces the use of a banjo in a instrumental funk tune. The title track shows Dylan influence. ""Long Line of Cars"" and ""Love You Madly"" will put you in a fabulous mood. And ""Commissioning..."", my favorite track, shows you how beautiful punk rock can be. A great CD. A must purchase. Ideal for driving down the highway in your convertible on a summer afternoon."
5,Surprised by this disc!,I enjoy all the previous Cake CDs - however I always felt half the tracks were fillers - although the solid tracks made up for this. Now I get Comfort eagle expecting the same - NOT SO! Certainly their most complete effort through and through. Of course this CD is worth whatever price just for the title track - but the addition of so many other solid tunes makes this one of those rare CDs where everything just comes together. Enjoy - I know this one will be in steady rotation in my player for many years.
4,good album,"This is a very good cd. I bought this after listening short skirt long jacket in san diego last summer. They still haven't played it on the east coast (!?). Before that I didn't know cake. Anyway, after downloading some other songs, I decided to buy it at a good price. The songs are of the same or better quality as ""short skirt, long jacket"". This is a consistently good, and a bit funny album. If you like short skirt... you'll like all the others as well, same style, same funkiness, same quality. no losers here. good job."
4,Please Pass the Cake,"With the number of the original Band Cake dropping,I was a bit hesitant to purchase this CD. I waspleasently surprised about how good this CD was.On previous CDs by Cake, the songs fell intothree categories songs I liked imediately,songs that I grew to like, and songs I nevercared for. With Comfort Eagle, I would say90% of the songs fall into that first category,and no songs fall into the final category.So, have your Cake and eat it too!"
4,Excellent jazz rendition of the Stevie Wonder.,This may well have been Stanley's greatest recording of the 80's decade. I do have this title on vinyl. I'm glad to see that it is now available on compact disc. It's definitely worth getting.
4,Great Book for People New to Java or Programming,"I have some experience with programming (from school and from a few programs back in the 80s and early 90s.) but did not have any object oriented programming experience. This book brings you up to speed on OOP and teaches Java at a very basic level. I was able to skim through the sections that were too basic and learn what I needed to learn. Lots of great utilities on the CDs. You don't have to shop around -- one set of books and software will get you started. If you like Java programming, you can move onto other tools or get the professional versions of the software provided. Great package for the beginner or for a refresher!"
1,"no support, manufacturer will not provide software, keys broken","While the basic functionality of this remote is good, the net is abismal. Many keys stop working and the manufacturer tells you to send it in and they will repair them for a minimum of $175. I did this once, now more keys have stopped working and they want to charge again. They will no longer provide the device list software (which you can ge from a few resellers like AudioBuys in Manassas, VA). The support folks at AUC are extraordinarily unhelpful, unknowledgeable and rude. 5 neighbors purchased at the same time and are having similar or worse issues. It is difficult to imagine how this company survives in this era of exceptional and user firendly devices. (good margins for ""authorized resellers"") I am replacing all of my 5 MX900s with Harmonys--a far superior device with superb customer support."
4,"Works well, more expensive than it should be","Does what it says it will. PC based programming much better than trying to key it into the remote itself. Costs more than it should, but if you want to program from the PC there are not many choices."
2,The Bad and not so good,"The Remote worked well for several months until the buttons started failing. The battery life is short and if you buy any new equipment forget about it, as it is not programable without a Tech to do it. I have replaced them twice now and I am done. $400.00 and a Tech at $100 per hour. Why does a Direct TV remote work for ever and the MX lasts 6 months to a year?"
2,Software Issues,"Software to setup the remote does NOT come with the remote! Getting it is a REAL hassle and when you get it there are more issues. Complete Codes for MANY devices are NOT provided and must be entered manually. DO NOT recommend this remote if you have ""NEWER"" model devices you want to control!"
2,expensive and breaks after two years,"this is a very expensive piece of equipment. it works well, when it works. but it will break after approximately 2 years, and the company that makes it will just shrug their shoulders and tell you you need to pony up another $125 to replace it. that is really bad business. if there was a good competitor, i would NOT buy this product."
2,Does Not Last,"When I first got this remote and had it professionally programmed (which, unless you are a geek, you must do), it worked pretty much fine. It's a little uncomfortable in the hand and requires at least 2 keystrokes (and sometimes 3) to turn the system on. That was annoying but tolerable. The really unacceptable thing, however, is the lack of durability. After about a year, the ""0"" key became sporadic in its responsiveness, and then completely failed. Since then, other of the number keys have stated to fail and the remote has become essentially unusable. I have since read other reviews that refer to the same problem. For almost $500 this remote should be more durable."
2,Good Remote - Bad condition,"I have ordered several items from Amazon in the past. This is the first time I am very disappointed with my purchase. When I received the box with the MX 900 Universal Remote, the box was in a very bad shape. But I did not expect the actual remote to be bad too. I had ordered several other items like Sony Receiver, Polk Front, Center and Rear speakers and Sub woofer. All other products are working out great. The buttons on this MX 900 remote are sticky. Even when I press them and hear the clicking sound, the action is not performed. I first thought my other devices are not getting the right signal from the remote. I had to spend money to bring in an A/V expert and he too concluded that the remote is not functioning properly. I am happy with the remote's capabilities. I am unhappy that the buttons don't work as well. It almost seems like I got a used one."
1,Same problem - buttons burn out,"This remote was always a bit hard to use. Lots of switching pages and find tuning. It was OK and I learned to live with it, but just as described in other reviews - THE BUTTONS STOP WORKING AFTER A FEW YEARS!!! First it was the right sided buttons, then the mute, then the volume. At this point the remote is a brick that sits at my side. Despite my best efforts to ""get along"" with this device I must protest - DO NOT BUY this remote..."
2,Works great--until it doesn't,"In June 2007, I had a professional install all of my AV equipment when I bought my house. He set me up with 3 of these devices (one for each room with a flat screen). After 18 months, the first one started to flake out on the most commonly used buttons. Yes--the same story as the other reviews. I had him return and for $400 (yes..another $400), he replaced and programmed it. After 24 months, remote #2 started to flake out. You get the picture. These remotes are extremely easy to use if they are set up by a professional. However, they are definitely not very cost efficient due to poor workmanship and durability. If your professional installer recommends this remote, please request a different one."
1,Not recommended,"This remote was expensive to purchase and program. Making changes or adding a device requires a ""professional"" at $150 / visit. Uness the company reverses it's policy and allows user programming, STAY AWAY FROM THIS REMOTE! Get a good Harmony."
3,Sent mine in for button repair,"I have one of these along with a base station. I really like the RF feature which makes this vastly superior to IR remotes because of the range, and the fact it works through solid objects like cabinet doors. Programmability is a bit dicey unless you have the software which is not readily available to end users.The downside as everyone else has mentioned is the problem with the buttons. Recently some of mine started acting flaky so I left a message on the manufacturer's web site about it. They contacted me and had me send it in for repair and at no charge. So at least they seem to be standing behind the unit now. The question of course is how long will the repair last? I hope it's for a good long time because except for the keyboard issue I really like this remote.Update: I've started using rechargable NiMH batteries in and they seem to work fine."
1,Oorly designed remote and no support from URC,I have the MX-900 and a Logitech Harmony One. The Logitech wins this battle by a large margin. It is easy to program and update newly added equipment. The Logitech includes the software and access to the Logitech database of remote codes. It asks logical questions to set it up and is easy to use. None of the above applies to the URC MX-900. What a worthless device. For $300 you can buy it and it will stop working and be obsolete inside of a month. Check out the Harmony One and throw this POS out.
1,WOW,"Mine actually lasted 4 years before the buttons stopped functioning, I guess I should consider myself lucky. Total waste of money. No way am I buying a new one!"
1,Very good product but low reliability and bad business practices,"This is actually an excellent remote. It is easy to use and works very well. That said, like almost every other reviewer it stopped working after about 18 months. Then you are faced with horrible business practices. No advanced replacement, $180 fee to get the remote replaced, and the need to get an installer to reprogram. All-in-all, unless they change their policy of only working through installers, I would recommend against this product."
2,Costly bad quality short life span item,One of the most costly remotes with a very limited lifespan. And it takes a pro (or a geek) to set it up. BOTH of mine started loosing functions after just 3 years of use and got completely non-functional shortly after. I would never go for this product again simply because the price is absurdly high for its poor quality.
1,Warning URC will not update Software for Consumer!!!!!,I purchaed this remote in August 2007. I installed the software and did a live update all was fine. In October 2007 after purchasing some new equipment I did the live update and got a message saying URC was no longer supporting this software. How can this be. URC stated when I called them that if I purchased it from and Authorized Dealer to contact them to get the updates. Well I did and Amazon sent me to 6th Ave and 6th Ave sent me to URC.Why? Well they will only let PRO Installers have the updates what am I going to hurt myself?I feel that AMAZON and 6TH AVE should not be selling these unless they inform the customer up front that they are purchasing an expensive piece of soon to be obsolete equipment seeing as you can not get updates.I guess I should have checked on the live update before the thirty day return policy expired.
1,Don't buy it......the buttons stop working,"The only reason I'm writing this review is because I need to buy a replacement after only two years.So I go to Amazon to look it up and when I found it listed, I couldn't believe how many other people are having the same problem.Wtf? If this mfr had any sense it would offer free replacements for this obvious manufacturing defect.It's outrageous to continue to sell a product with such a high failure rate."
1,Key board failure,Too much money for a keyboard that fails within two years. I have two of these expensive remotes and both have failed with two years for the purchase date. Going to try Logetech. I am now back using three remotes. NOT GOOD!!!
1,MX-900 a rip off,All bad reviews are 100% accurate and the manufacturer propagates this bad product with high prices and no support. I think it's time for a class action lawsuit since it says it's programmable and you can download software and you can't. Buttons are designed to fail. These clowns should go out of business.
1,"overpriced and poorly constructed, poor support","I have had this product since 2007. I paid $1500.00 which included programming.Pros:when it works, it works fine which was rare after 2.5 years of useCons:buttons failed after 2.5 years of use, neither URC nor their dealers provided support for a defective productbatteries are changed quarterly.technician cost for reprogramming every time a new component was added or deleted.Do not buy this product. There are better products from Savant or Control4 now, while I cannot speak for Logitech, I have seen some good reviews."
1,This product sucks,"Trying to obtain software for this remote is like trying to get the launch codes for the nuclear missles!I have been trying for two days - they promised to send me a link to the download within 2 hours but most definitely within 24 hours...did not happen for either of those timeframes and they do not care when you call them on the telephone. I got bounced from department to department with each one saying, ""gee, I'm sorry I can't help you, but I will transfer you to someone who may be able to""I would never again buy this product and it is only a gnat's hair away from being tossed in the trash in favor of a Harmony Link or something more reasonable to work with!!"
4,"Difficult to use, but worth it","I'm buying another to replace the first, which failed after years of nearly-continuous channel surfing by my son. Its very customizable, it is fast, responsive, has a great feel in the hand due to enough mass, the buttons are backlit, and soft-buttons are physical rather than touch-screen, so you can feel them in the dark. It has good device support, and it can also ""learn"" from the IR signals of other remotes. The thing eats batteries, so get some good rechargeables like the Sanyo Eneloops. Apparently, one can write one's own device libraries, but I've never come across any documentation.Its really intended for professional installers, so if you aren't tech-savvy, buy something simple like the Logitech Harmony series. The programming software is weird and difficult. You will need to download updated software/database before you start, which in and of itself is challenging since the URC web site is a navigational disaster. remotecentral.com is also a good resource."
5,"American Diagnostic Corporation 3010G Corrosion Resistant Surgical Stainless Steel Gold 5 1/2"" Lister Bandage Scissors","Scissors were as advertised, fast shipment and undamaged. Worked great for removing tape from my daughter's ankles that she gets tapped before each basketball game."
3,"Cool color, needs to be sharpened","I bought these because of the color, so it would be harder to lose these when I'm working. They dont hold a sharp edge that well, but they are inexpensive so I guess they are worth what you pay for them."
1,not a happy camper,i ordered for a christmas present and i have a big work schedcule so i dont have much time for shopping. i received the plastic and the charge for this but no the product. so it has put me in a big bind. i have no present for my dad and they didnt offer to maybe upgrade the scissors just to give me my money and tell me they were out of stock!
3,Fair enough,"Excellent service and shiping time. A fair value for the money. A typical value for medical instruments made in Pakistan. Not top of the line, but a good value for the price."
4,"ok, not great.","These scissors are only adequate. They are a bit on the smaller side. Somehow, I was thinking that 4 1/2inch scissors would be a bit larger. The blade portion of these scissors is very short. The quality is good but I wish I had ordered a pair a bit larger with a longer cutting blade."
1,Not practical for use,"I am a nursing student which means that when the opportunity arises, I am there with full gear! Unfortunately, these scissors have let me down so many times. I was not able to cut through simply 4X4 gauze, or abdominal bandages to custom fit patients for wound care. I have tried to sharpen them but that too also failed.**(was not purchased through amazon)"
3,Interesting and Moderately Entertaining... For a While.,"I was fairly disappointed by The Sims 2. There is essentially no design aspect to this game, and that is a big part of why I enjoyed the other Sims games. Instead of having your Sim live his/her life as usual, you need to complete missions. Despite being totally different from what I expected, it was an okay game and did hold my interest for a little while."
2,what happened?,"I bought this game expecting it to be somewhat like the sims on the computer. I guess I shouldn't assume. This game is a complete let down. To get skill points you have to find them randomly around the town which i feel is really stupid. then to increase your relationships, all you can do is a 3 choice thing based on the body language of the other character. I want to talk to the people. I want to do workout to get body skill points. If you are expecting something like the computer version, think twice before buying this game."
4,Pretty Good Compared to Others,"I got this game for Chirstmas and was pleasantly surprised by it. I had the Sims 2 game for GBA and had liked it, but enjoyed this game more. It is very entertaing and can keep me busy for hours (usually 3 at the most). My only complaints with it are that I didn't always like the fact that it ran on real world time because that meant that if I wanted to build something and it said it would take 8 hours, that was really the length of time it would take. Plus I didn't like that fact that if I didn't play for a period of time, my whole hotel was in disarray and usually the repo men had come to take things away because my bills hadn't been paid. But other than those things, I really enjoyed this game and would reccommend it for all new buyers because it is easy to understand and play and is fun and entertaining."
4,good game,this is a fun game. in the gamr you become amanager of a hotel and try to get guests to stay there. there is hardlt a time when u r bored because there is new goals for you to try aliens to fight or something. parts of the game are challenging though like i have 65% completed my hotel and i cant figure out wht to du nxt. but it is a fn game. i dont think it has any replay value because it just wouldnt be fun playing it again but i think its well worth the money.
2,The Sims 2,This game is horrible you can't build or get good stuff!!!!! I would not recommend this game to anyone
3,Sims 2 for PSP,"Not nearly as much fun as the Sims computer game, but still addictive. I beat the game relatively quickly. I enjoyed the art room and casino but I found many of the other rooms repetitive."
3,Short but Sweet,"I am a huge fan of the Sims2, so when I found out there was a Sims2 game for my DS, of course I bought it. Initially, I thought the game was a lot of fun, but was disappointed that it was so short! I beat it in a mere two days. And somehow, my mayor has gone mysteriously missing, even though every time I call him, he says he's in the town hall. Hmm..."
2,Not at all like the PC version,"When I purchased this game, I was looking for a DS version of the PC game. I wanted to build houses, develop relationships, create stories within the characters I created, etc. However, this game is just like the Urbz for the DS--and even utilizes some of the same characters. Most of the game is spent calming down or restraining the characters who are bugging out for no reason. Doing this, drains your sanity and becomes repetitive and annoying extremely fast. The game is too objective-based and lacks the appeal of the Sims 2 in its creativity for the PC. I found this game to be a disappointment."
4,I think its okay.,"Okay so yeah, this game may freeze up from time to time. Its done this to me about ten times, maybe more. I hadn't saved it, so it was really annoying and I didn't feel like playing anymore. Also, you can't personalize your room or your looks. There isn't much room in the manager suite, either.Even so...this game is the BOMB!! I couldn't stop playing during the mission. After I completed the mission, it was even better! I love the art gallery, and the casino. The different choices for furniture is great. I love the clothing options. Graphics aren't exactly perfect, but hey, beggars can't be choosy. We must remember that its on a little DS and not PC.So I highly recommend this to anyone. It takes a little bit of patience, but the game will soon grow on you like it did me. I love it!"
3,Fun but not the best,"The title of this review pretty much says it all. The game is pretty fun but it certainly isn't on my favorites list.Basically you're stranded in Strangetown and are keeping a hotel clean / making the people happy, which honestly is very repetitive. But somehow it stays pretty fun. Everytime I play it I pretty much do the exact same things that I did the last time I played. Normally that would make a game boring, but somehow this game doesn't get that way.Although, I do really wish there was more character interaction. All you can do with the other characters in the game is check them into a room, let them boss you around, and get them to stop throwing a fit. You can't really become friends and there's not much of a romance system. When another character wants you to, you can kiss them but that's pretty much it. Wow... kissing. How exciting -_-Overall I'd say it's worth buying, but I might suggest that you get it used or renting it first, just to be sure."
3,The Sims 2 DS,"It was an okay game, I havn't been able to beet it because i got bored and lost it, but it is very entertaining for a while, but unless you wait a couple days, you have to play this retarded card game to make money to run the hotel. And if you don't play it like at least every other day all your customers go away bedause you need to clean it the hotel, check in and out customers, and stock the furnace."
1,This isn't a sims game,I played this game for three days and noticed it isn't a sims game. You cannot create sims like before and those sims can't get married and have babies. All u do is manage a hotel in a town with one road and 5 buildings. I feel sorrry for u if u bought this game.
1,Not Fun At All,"This game is not very fun. It's okay, but what I hate the most is the new sanity meter. It dosnt show your needs seperatly, and when you have a need it goes down like crazy untill you fufill it but you don't know what you need untill it pops up over your head. The place is very small, not many places to go to, but a plus is the remixer where you can sample your voice into a song. There is not very much interactivity between people. You could make out with someone you just met, it's not realistic like the past sim games were. If you want a fun sims game, I'd suggest Sims Bustin Out for GBA or The Urbz for GBA or DS. This game was a waste of money."
4,It's ok,"When I started playing the game it was fun, but I never found out how to calm the guy down when he was pissed off, so I never got to find out much else about the game. I still have it, but it's gathering dust. It's a cool game if you have the patience."
2,Boring,"Compared to all the other sims games it is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You have to be a hotel maneger. I hate that you don't get to live in a house. You don't even get to talk to people normally you can only do romance,cheer them up, calm them down, and restrain."
5,This Game Is So Much FUN!,"I would have to say that this is a great game. I know that it is rated E, but it is really fun. Ther is NO loading problems. You get to run the Strangetown hotel and do cool stuff. The only problem is, though, it uses real hours. But, you can always speed up the time by changing it on the main screen of your Ds. I love the sims games. I have them for gamecube. Even though you can't get married or have babies, this game really rocks. It is alot of fun to play and trust me once you start playing it, you'll never want to stop! Overall, this game is really fun and you should get it. It will be worth your money."
4,A nice twist on the usual SIMS,"I really enjoy this game. The tasks aren't too difficult and work in real time, so you have to wait a bit but that doesn't mean there isn't plenty to do! The SIMS creators have made a whole new mini simverse to interact, grow, and explore. After playing one time through you don't have many more options, but the mini games and character interactions are always worth re-visiting."
2,A very uneven novel,"The New York Times review was right. I found the first third of this novel dull and plodding, the middle section quite good, and the last third poorly edited and at times unreadable. It was if the novel had been written by two different authors--one who was in command of the subject matter (the middle third) and one who desperately needed a strong editor to help shape her writing (the rest of the book)."
2,Superficial,"I lived in Korea in the late-1970s and still possess affection for its people and interest in its history. I read this book to update my knowledge of how a 'modern' Korean looked at the world. Unfortunately I found it full of stereotypes, characters who were barely alive on the page. Only the dissolute brother held any interest. I found the descriptions of the family relationships were awkward and superficial. It's a pity because the scope and theme of the book is fascinating, and the mother's narration of historical events of interest, despite the blandness of her character. Overall I thought the author was too prepared to accept what Koreans think about themselves at face value, and not explore the differences between perception and reality. With the exception of a few pages, the final section reads more like a travelogue than a search for identity. Nice try but not quite there."
1,Extremely Disappointing Novel,"I can't believe this book managed to snag any favorable reviews. And I can't believe an editor looked at it before publication. I found it a very dull read of mostly graceless prose. Stout may be a competent journalist, for all I know, but she's certainly no novelist."
3,Thought provoking and worthwhile,"I am also a second generation Korean-American interested inlearning more about my heritage. I could spend time criticizingStout, but overall, I greatly enjoyed her style and story-telling. While the book might not stay with me in detail, the painful scenes depicting the pain and horror of Japanese occupation and Civil War made me wonder if I would have been strong enough to endure what my parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents went through.If you're lucky enough to have your relatives around, thank them for their strength. I am glad to have learned more about a time that my parents did not want to tell me about as a child. This book has given me the desire to learn more."
4,somewhat disappointing,"The premise for this book was promising - but the substance was a disappointment to me. I almost felt the book should have been twice as long - and would have preferred to have the personality of the characters developed further. It just seemed to go too fast. I thoroughly enjoyed the historical aspects - in fact I learned alot I didn't know about the Korean War, etc. I don't doubt the fictional story is based in interesting historical fact - but great periods of time seemed to have been left out. For instance - it referred at one point to the younger son having been put in a sanitarium but the details of this interesting occurance was left out of the story. It was just an OK story."
1,not enough information & very misleading,"89 dodge ram 100. Water in the oil. Replaced head gaskets and bearings. The book had no directions about installing rod and mains. No torque specs. Not knowing how to install the bearings because no information was provided, the bearings spun, and it had very very low oil pressure. The bearings & crankshaft is trashed."
2,"Better than nothing, but not by much","#1 word used in this book? ""Typical""#1 phrase used in this book? ""Installation is the reverse of removal.""Perhaps I've been spoiled by the Bentley manuals I've picked up for my various Volkswagens over the years. Bentley manuals are so complete that you almost feel if you left the manual in the car over night IT would fix the car.This book is so vague, its hard to know whether to trust the guidance it gives. There are some things you need specific information on, but this book only gives general instructions, and very little troubleshooting help. Again, its better than flying blind, but it could be much more comprehensive."
4,Pink Floyd X 10,"Do not do LSD or any mind altering drugs while listening to this CD. Your brain will melt and turn to jelly, but you'll be so much wiser after you listen...Saw them Live at The Academy of Music in NYC in the 70's. Unfortunately that is another music palace that was torn down...bastards!"
4,do not be fooled by the image provided!!!,"this is a really cute keychain...yes the description says mickey mouse...and the picture is of minnie...but I decided to take a chance and I ended up with mickey. it's still cute but i was kinda hoping it would be minnie. oh well, we're gonna use it for a zipper pull for my son now instead of my daughter. a great item though."
1,cheap was its only advantage,"My 440 came as part of a package, and boy I wish it hadn't. It skips big parts of every document, compresses part of the text on most things, and just starts printing gobbldygook on page after page. None of the troubleshooting tips has helped, but my thirty days is up (I kept thinking it had to get better, or I was doing something wrong) and I'm stuck. I finally disconnected it and stuck in an old HP which is infinitely more reliable."
1,"Very cheap, flimsy","It won't last the night. The leaves aren't that dark. Sort of a light, neon green. I'd pass on this one for anyone other than a kid."
4,It's definitely Rodney!!!!,"Although some of his earlier material is better, this is still pretty funny. If you're a Rodney fan then I would definitely recommend it."
4,Great CD,"I like Rodney Carrington, don't get me wrong. This Album has it's moments, I like his older Albums better."
5,Incredible Story!,"This is one of the best fantasy books that I ever read. Unlike the flood of TSR/Tolkien replica fantasy that came after it, this author spoke with an original voice and wasn't overly influenced by all the regurgitated ideas that have since become a staple. I remember that I kept looking back to the front cover in places, wondering if I were reading a comedy. But after a few pages I would be reassured again and again that it was a serious fantasy after all. It just had alot of quality humor in it! Great plot, great setting, great fictional kingdoms, well developed charactars, and a thoroughly enjoyable read!J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"
3,Ok,"Zapper is an ordinary game, nothing special and nothing bad.Even though the storyline is the weakest I've seen in a game, it's colorful graphics makes up for the thin story.Zapper is a cricket, not an ordinary cricket, but a cricket with zapping powers in his atennaes, which he uses to stun or even to annihilate foes. After his baby brother gets kidnapped he sets out on journey to save his brother from the evil bird, from the forest to the city, you'll encounter some pretty enviroments and great music. I suggest that you'll rent first, to see if it's for your taste, it will save you a great deal of money, but I liked it, but it's not my favourite game."
5,My 2 year old loves it!,"At times, my son will want to watch the entire 2 hour length of the video. Nothing scary about this video, though at times, it almost puts the 2-year-old's parents to sleep!"
5,In two words: FAITH PRINCE,"Hearing Faith Prince on this recording feels like having her sing in your living room! This woman is a great, great talent, a sensational singer, and should be recording solo rather than waiting for some producer to come along and give her a job. I barely recognize Martin Short's contributions after Sid Caesar's landmark classic of ""Little Me"" from days of yore. But I guarantee that you will not forget Faith Prince's version of ""The Other Side of the Tracks."" You might find yourself humming it on the way to work."
3,Old Dependable....Little Me !!!!,"I was fortunate to see the limited run of this 1999 Broadway Revival. If you'll only have one reason to buy this CD is because of Cy Coleman's score. Martin Short is definitely irreplaceable as all the guys in Belle Poitre's life plus Benny Bauschum. He provided a ""soul"" to this recording. I also enjoyed Michael Park's sexy rendition of ""I Got Your Number"" . I am just glad they recorded this revival.. because I loved the score (though the opening number , ""The Truth"" was removed in favor of ""Little Me"")"
2,A show that thrives only the presence of its star,"I bought this CD for two reasons: ""I've Got Your Number"" and ""The Other Side of the Tracks."" The rest of the music is a bad example of what Cy Coleman can do. Get his ""City of Angels"" CD instead."
3,Hilarious,"Judy Moody, M.DThe Doctor Is In!By Megan McDonaldJudy Moody is back!!! This time Judy has a challenge to become just like her idol, Elizabeth Blackwell, the first women doctor. Judy has a school assignment and it's about the human body. Judy dresses up like Elizabeth Blackwell for her project and operates on her patient, a zucchini. Meanwhile her brother, Stink gets sick, and her friend Frank tries to clone a guinea pig that is Jessica Finch's, Judy's enemy. This book is for kids of all ages. The illustrator did an awesome job on all the pictures and the author describes the situations beautifully and you can get a picture in your mind about what she is talking about. This book is really laugh out loud funny. I think that Judy is hilarious because she tries all these crazy things and she thinks that she can become the first girl doctor. Are Judy's friends there to help her or betray her? Hope you enjoy this book!!"
5,Scholarship at its finest,"This is the best piece of literary criticism I have read on a Russian author, and definitely one of the best pieces in lit studies in general. Greenleaf is sophisticated yet remarkably clear and persuasive. And the book is not just useful for readers of Pushkin; I would argue that any lit student should read some of this, to get a sense of how genre figures into literary analysis. I loved it."
4,Insightful,The video is a little pedestrian at times and has low production value(like most soccer videos) but is insightful. I like the tactical analysis of various formations and the situational problems that each systems of play creates against various formations. The narrations hightlight the problems that varrying formations will face against each other and provide potential solutions for overcomming these problems.
2,great scrub -however...,"amending review...per EWG.org this product contains some nasty stuff, I have stopped using this product, sorry about the earlier review"
2,too bad it is made with plastic...,"I love almost everything about this stuff. However, the exfoliant beads that feel like sand appear to be made from plastic, according to the ingredient list. No I feel like I am littering every time I wash my face. I'll be looking for a new face cleaner. It's too bad, because I liked this stuff so much."
5,Best Scrub,"This product is spendy, but works really well. It does just as you want it to, it's not too abrasive where you can only use it a few days a week. I have very sensitive skin and I use it everyday. The smell is very nice to. I use it because I get bumps easy and this really helps with that. It keeps my skin very smooth so the razor doesn't drag and cause the irritation. I totally recomend!"
4,Jack Black has great products but.....,in my opinion they are a bit overpriced. This is why the 4 stars. This face buff works better than others I tried. It also has a nice scent and makes your face feel really refreshed.
4,"Great pre-shave conditioner, as an exfoliant good-not great.","Overall a good product for pre-shave conditioning. The menthol is a nice touch as it addes a clean refreshing touch.It is ok as an exfoliant, but nothing like the best I have found... Clinques face scrub - that stuff will remove your skin to the bone if you wanted. The Clinique scrub is an extremely thick sandy paste which works far better as an exfoliant.However for an everyday pre-shave wash the Black Jack Buff is a really good quality product. I do really like this product but seems a bit overpriced as it appears more similar to the $5-$8 tubes of beaded face scrubs than an exfoliant.I will likely continue to use Jack Black as it does work so well for pre-shaving (and I like the scent and menthol)"
5,rough and gritty,"i really like the granular texture of this face scrub. i've tried a lot of face scrubs w/ softer beads and they don't exfoliate as well as this product does. the beads in this product are really small and make up most of the product, whereas other face scrubs are filled w/ mostly cleanser. it leaves your skin feeling new and even after you scrub. the smell has that signature masculine jack black smell - which i personally don't care for - but the scrub works so well that i use it anyway."
5,Great Product!,"Jack Black makes a great men's line... Can't say enough about this face scrub - gentle, effective, and invigorating smell. Give it a try - you'll be hooked!"
3,Finally died,"I've had my 740 for about 8 1/2 years, and today was the first day I had a major problem with it. It no longer prints in black and white, but the color is not affected. I guess I've been lucky with it, since I've heard of this happening to people within 1-2 years of buying it. My experience with Epson has been fine thus far, but I'm not sure that I'd push my luck by getting another one in light of all the complaints I've heard about their products."
5,"Followup review, warranty expired, still handles paper well","I wrote a review a while back about this item and promised to follow up once the warranty expired. Other owners had commented that they had problems with their printers. I am happy to report we have not, but then again, we don't print much more than photos on ours. Some of the newer Epsons can handle edge to edge printing on Epson paper. I tried other paper, and the results are not as good as Epson paper. The newer Epson's might be better at handling ""other people's paper"".I did get to use a Epson 777 about a few months back, and it was better than this model. So Epson has made improvements that should help alleviate the complaints about this model from other owners.I'm looking at buying another one of these Epson just to get a faster print speed on my high resolution photos. Currently a 4x6 high resolution (1440 dpi) takes about 1-2 minutes to print. END"
5,Great - Inexpensive Printer,"I bought an EPSON 740 and absolutely love it. If you have the time, count the number of 5-star ratings this little beauty has recieved. Need I say more?"
1,Piece of junk,"I have had this printer for about 2 years, and have had headaches with it ever since. I cannot even describe what the problem is - when I turn it on (from time to time), it makes awful noise and all of the ""trouble"" lights turn on. This happens intermittently, and always at the worst possible time, but I am always unable to print indefinitely when it happens (until it magically decides to work again). Print heads clog easily and streak all over the page - I have rarely had decent print quality from this printer. I have been putting up with this piece of junk for far too long and after not being able to print at a crucial time today, have decided to give up and buy a new printer. I hate this printer."
2,Warning!,"I bought this printer about a year ago. It worked fine for like 6 months then things started to go wrong. It uses a lot of ink, and ink cartridges are expensive. Finally at around 1 year old it died. It kept elling me there was no paper, and then when it finally took 1 piece of paper it jammed and didn't print. This is my warning to allof you, spend alittle more and buy an HP."
3,Happy until ink runs out,"I have had my Epson 740 for about 6 months now. It seems to be fine except for a couple things. One is that is doesn't hold much paper. More importantly is the cost of the ink cartridges. They are about $20 for black and $26 for color. I'm on my third black and second color cartridge in 6 months. Beyond that, the printer quits working if either cartridge is out of ink. My color ink was out and the printer refused to print a paper that had no color. This was upsetting."
4,"ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS, very nostalgic.","I loved this DVD. It reminded me of the way I jumped and cheered at 5 am in my basement during the 02 World Cup. I really wish that they had a DVD like this for our previous World Cup teams, as I am a bit of a collector, and the 94 Cup was so special, really kickstarted US Soccer. The matches are edited, so you are watching actual match footage, not just highlights. I actually cheered everytime the US scored, even 4 years later. Very exciting presentation. A little more in-depth coverage could have been provided as far as pre-match buildup and whatnot, but considering it is th eonly item of its kind out there (that I know of), it's a great DVD."
5,The best forklift,"My 3 1/2 yr old son loves trucks, cars and construction equip. of all kinds. This is a great realistic forklift with no batteries, so he uses his imagination with sounds, etc. It has held up through many falls and even a trip down a slide. Highly recommend."
1,"Great idea, but poor quality and durability.","The Bruder Fork Lift is a great idea, but is very poor quality. The forks are not durable and break easily leaving a very sad and disappointed child. The forks need more durability since they are marketed for small children. My grandson loves construction vehicles and was very excited with the fork lift until one of the forks broke. Purchasers should receive replacement or refund. I would never again purchase a Bruder product."
1,forks broke IMMEDIATELY,"My 3 year old son played with this toy for 5 minutes, and both forks broke. Can't imagine even at 10 year old not breaking it. It looks great, but you better leave it as a display piece. On a high shelf."
2,Forks slide off,"Well forks slide alright. Within a day of getting it one fork slid right off and got lost. Now I have to order replacement forks probably from Germany! Its fine to make them moveable but why do they need to slide off? Doesn't make sense, at least put a stop at the ends or something."
4,Good product,My only complaint is that the forks come off relatively easily. The fork moves up and down well. The quality is good.
1,Did not receive item,"I am sure my four year old would have loved this. He has several Bruder trucks and this would have been great to add to it. The reason for my low rating is that it was shipped but to the wrong address and I have not received it. Unfortunately, Amazon has only the package feedback and not the seller for this item. I still would like to receive it."
5,battery door,the cheapest ever! the only place you can buy the battery door w/out the battery.got 2! thanks!
1,Broken Watch,I bought this watch from Amazon and got it in broken condition. Never work please do not buy this watch.
3,Product okay,"However it is not 12 foot, more like 6. Product does what it says, just was not the length advertised!"
5,More Tools,"Awesome tools for my husband!! My husband, just had to have these tools for an add on addition of the tools he already has!!!"
5,Perfect,I use this wrench to change chassis settings on a Drit lae Model. It is quick and works perfect for my needs.
4,Some rare material from Jorge Ben,"This disc appears to reissue some rare material from Brazilian samba-funk legend Jorge Ben's 1967 album, ""O Bidu - No Silencio Do Brooklyn"", which has been out of print for decades... and is an amazing pop/psychedelic record. The tracks from Maria Creuza seem kind of randomly tacked on, but there's nothing wrong with them musically. Some ""O Bidu"" tracks are also available on the 2002 ""Serie Identidade"" CD."
3,Diverse rather than comprehensive,"When you start reading, you will find the authors have used too much space in this book to introduce the papers they published. They describe their own papers in such details such that even performance evaluations are included! On the other hand, the architecture of the book is rather incomplete possibly because the author want to cover too many areas: multiprocessor, distributed system (including Object-Oriented) and networking. The content in each part is not comprehensive enough, either. The works of other peoples are not presented in detail or analyzed.However, to be fair, this book does address some issues not present in other books, including objected-oriented distributed systems, detailed scheduling in real-time communications and two case studies, which I like."
4,cold weather warmth,Perfect for keeping the draft out of your coat/jacket in colder weather. It was the right length not too long not too short and very soft and colors are very nice.
3,Needs work,"Would like more adjustment possibilities. The cushion does not line up with my shoulder. It could be because I'm am 's a large man. If it's intention is to provide a temporay sling, it works."
4,"Shotgun Sling No Swivels Required,","Looked good, fit my shotgun great and very comfortable on my shoulder carrying. If you have an older gun and don't want to have to fit it with sling studs then I highly recommend this for you."
3,"I Finally found ""Hard to find"" song...THANKS!!!","Although I rated this CD 3 stars, if given the opportunity, I would've rated the song ""You're All I Need, To Get By"" (featuring Patti LaBelle) 5 stars. Patti is my FAVORITE artist of all time. Now that I have gotten this song from this CD, I can honestly and officially say...that I have EVERYTHING that Patti has ever recorded!!Rick"
4,LOOK AT THIS PRICE!,"I cant believe this sellar has the gull to ask $500+ for the new cd format. Granted this lp/cd was released in 1989-90? but the price is ridiculous! I am so sure that this cd (which i would love to own if only for the cover of ""Your All I Need To Get By"" titled ""You're All I Need"" on this cd & also as a duet with Patti LaBelle) will remain on the shelf at the sellers home or business because of the asking price. This is a good cd by a fabulous artist but times are hard right now AND THE PRICE OF $500.00+ THEY NEED TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES! DEAN JOSEF MARTELL Pgh,PA. (dmartell1101@comcast.net)"
2,Disappointing,"This product is very small, the drawers are shallow and not much will fit in it. It also does not have a fully covered back, so anything can get into/out of the drawers. Why would I want a dresser without a back covering? The product itslef takes forever to assemble and looks sort of cheap. I'd return it but that would be an annoying amount of trouble. Do yourself a favor and buy a different dresser, one with a back covering on it!!!"
1,"Antediluvian view, not ""new"" view","This book appeared just two years before homosexuality was removed from the official list of mental disorders. It was written by a psychotherapist from the old point of view, the view of homosexuality as a disease. Every chapter, almost every page, of this lengthy book drips with hostility to homosexuals. It became outdated almost as soon as it was published. Not recommended except to those who hate homosexuals."
1,Junk,"I have purchased jewelry from Amazon.com in the past and been very satisfied, but these earrings were junk! I purchased them as a birthday present for my wife, and when she took the earrings out, the ""gold"" on the posts flaked right off, revealing black metal underneath.To add insult to injury, as I made the purchase a little over a month before her birthday, Amazon charged me a 20% restocking fee. I suppose I should be grateful - they originally weren't going to take them back at all, but as they were defective, they decided to only charge me $95.40 for the privilege of returning their defective product and ruining my wife's birthday. Thanks, Amazon!"
1,Morello Un standard Tmie,"This was a diaster. Never again. I received an inferior product, skipped, inaudible on the last track(supposedly the best track). A stampted ""promotional"" stamp on the disc-as I understand this means it cannot be available for resale. What a huge dissapointment. I'll never fall for this fraudulent scheme again. All the said info. was sent to the ""providers"". No response, no refund, no protection from mighty Amazon- thanks fellas! Beware, you're own your own when the manure hits the fan."
5,Very nice source of backup power at a good price,"Electricity in my apartment would randomly go out for a couple of seconds every few weeks, usually at night, but i would find that my servers had a harsh shutdown and rebooted the next day. Very frustrating and i would lose some unsaved work. This backup battery takes care of that problem very well. It comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events. The software isnt of the best design but it works. No linux software but it can still be used without it. The unit has 6 power outlets but only 3 are powered by the battery. I have 2 servers and a router hooked up to it."
2,Fails to meet expectations,"First, let me say I don't often write reviews for Amazon. But this item was so disappointing, I felt the need to do so. This product has several small problems that add up.1) The battery died after less than 6 months. I have several other units that have been in use much longer and are still running fine.2) The On Battery Power alarm cannot be shut off. You MUST put up with the annoyance until you power down your equipment and turn the unit off. (Unless you are connected to a PC, wasting a USB port. It's not. It was connected to a Mac.)3) The Replace Battery alarm cannot be shut off. You MUST put up with the annoyance until you replace the battery or turn the unit off - turning off your equipment.4) I hate it when moron designers think they know better than I do on how I will place my equipment. This unit comes with the power plug angled to the right, which typically is the wrong direction for my placement."
3,APC ES 500,"I have the unit connected to a Mac.My only disappointment with this product, is the switch does not disable all the outlets. When you power off the main switch, only the battery backup outlets are disconnected.The surge protected outlets remain powered when the main switch is turned off.Other than the switch, I am very happy with this unit. I have some experience with APC battery products. All my servers at work are protected with much bigger units, but this will work fine for my home computer."
2,Does the opposite of its job,"This UPS worked fine for a couple years, but now whenever our laser printer turns on (it's plugged into a nearby outlet), the UPS glitches the power to the devices it serves -- a cordless phone base, a router, a cable modem, and a telephone adapter -- badly enough to cause a reboot. (Obviously, the laser printer must be pulling the line voltage down, but if I substitute an ordinary power strip for the UPS, there's no visible glitch.) This seems like an anti-UPS: amplifying an unnoticeable voltage sag into a failure-inducing power glitch.I will be looking for a replacement made by a different manufacturer."
1,APB lacks customer service,"This highly publicized device unit beeped incessantly each time the power was off.One day when the unit stopped beeping, that was the day the device did not work! I contacted customer service about their ""life-time warranty"" several times. After giving me the run-around, they did not bother to respond. This company's motto seems to be, ""The customer is always wrong."" I have decided to stay clear of this company's products."
2,BE500U Did not Last,The previous model; BE500U did not last long; did not know if it was the battery or the electronics. But the price of the new units when on sale did not make purchasing a battery see worthwhile.
2,Disappointing lifespan,"This unit worked fine while it lasted, but the battery quit holding its charge after sixteen months. The power has only gone off 4-5 times in that span, and only once did it shut down (in the other instances, the power was back on in just a few moments or minutes).Like other commenters have said, a new battery is about the same as a new unit. I'm going to shop around for a better-reviewed brand."
1,Plan on buying a new one every 6 months or so,Battery doesn't hold charge. You'll have a nice lunky object to dispose of in some environmentally friendly way. Will never buy again.
1,Short Life Span,I have had this item for only 1 year and now it beeps and my PC loses power in the middle of the day. Nothing else in the room shows any kind of a problem. This unit wasn't worth the money as it did not last very long.
2,Spontaneously turns off sometimes,"I hooked one of these units to my 35 inch TV, VCR, DVD player and XBox. Every fews months, the unit spontaneously turns off. I hear the snap of a relay and it's gone. I have to hold down the power button for 5 seconds to turn it back on. There was no alarm or warning of any kind before it turned itself off. Works most of the time, but for something that is suppose to provide uninterrupted power, it definately doesn't. The TV may be drawing too much current, but once it shut itself down in the middle of the night when everything was off. Maybe this device is a piece of junk."
3,Good Product - But Mac users beware,"I purchased this unit after reading the reviews here. The unit works very well and is easy to install. One point mentioned in earlier reviews, however, needs to be revisited and clarified.The on-battery alarm CANNOT be disabled with the software if you are running it on a Mac. The alam CAN be disabled with software if you are running it on a PC.This means that if you plan to use this unit on a Mac and you really want to disable the annoying alarm that beeps every 30 seconds when the system goes to battery power you have one choice: Install the unit and software on a PC first and disable the alarm through the PC interface. Then install the unit and software on your Mac with the alarm now disabled. If you don't have a PC available to act as a SWITCH like this, then you are out of luck and you will have no way to turn off the ear-splitting alarm."
1,Equipment Replacement Policy is a SHAM!,"Just know going in - if your equipment gets fried, they won't pay you a dime. They will blame it on anything from faulty building wiring to bad grounding and deny your claim. Why don't they just print '$500,000,000,000 WARRANTY' on the box - if they don't intend to stand behind their product? I had one computer system that was wireless and it's only link to electricity was through an APC battery. Lightning struck and it died and started to smell burnt. I sent in the claim and the unit & got what looks like their standard protocol - sorry, no replacement. The system was only worth $200 which is far less than our company spends annually on batteries. I won't use APC again."
3,"Bugs, Crash and more. Dont they playtest this first?","This game has a lot of depth and I would recommend that you get it. A nice feature is the large and in depth technology tree and nice graphics. I am going to keep this game just because it has such potential. However, I will highlight just a few of the problems I have encountered in the last 24 hours, THAT THE MOST RECENT PATCH DOES NOT FIX. (11-26 patch)The game has crashes at least 4-5 times an hour. Whats upsetting is the fact that some of the bugs could have been fixed with some iota of playtesting by the developer. For example, if you try and upgrade a military unit of a country you are allied with the game crashes.The resource management sounds good but I have 99999 of each resource after a few years. Therefore the resource management is worthless.The bottom line is this: its a great game that was rushed to the market and is LOADED with technical glitches and bugs."
3,"Liked Europa Universalis, hated this game","When I heard this game came out and that it was by the same makers as EU, I was excited to start playing. I was very disappointed. This game, in my opinion, was harder than Europa Universalis--too hard to make it enjoyable. I still think though that the game is well put together and would be very interesting for those that like this era of history. Not for the light gamer."
4,"Very good, but could of been a bit better","This game could have been one of the best ever ww2 strategy games. It is very realistic in all most everything. The ""bad"" part about this game is that there isnt a lot of tech support. There are patches but they still have many bugs to fix, i.e. lan multi is sometimes screwy. overall, a better then your average game."
5,Wonderful,The game is fun and depending on your mental capabilities you can do anything.(ever see brazil conquer the world??????????)pretty much got me off of playing risk. I just need to get a chair with a back because playing for 10 hours straight hurts your back.I has no patches. And the brazillians do not easily crush germany. Trust me. Its a game your either gonna love or hate. I personally Love it
3,looks are decieving,"all the detail in the game is really mesmerizing. fascinating until you get through the first months of playing and realize commerce, diplomacy, research although keeps up a promising appearance, it just don't amount to beans, ie you can rsearch all the stuff for nuclear bombs and/or V1 or V2 rockets, the game just does not have them designed to ever really happen. the designers figure you'll be too engrossed slogging it out with the icons. a real let down and major dissapointment when i finally have to accept the game is not all they marketers promise."
2,Interesting but ultimately unfulfilling,"I've played this game with the 1.05 patch, which greatly changes the game, i.e., making it a lot harder to do well. It's too much of a simulation. It's hard to do things that didn't happen in real life. It's very time-consuming and complex. Micromanagment is critical to success. If you have the patience for that, you might like the game."
2,Slow moving - Complex - Unexciting,"I played this game avidly for two days then, permanently uninstalled it from my computer. I am an avid wargamer, going back to the days when most games of this genre were boardgames. The old Avalon Hill title "" Hitler's War "", would be a much better choice. Considering that this is a wargame, combat is unexciting and it is very difficult to predict the outcome of an individual battle. Given all the complexity, one has to either slow down the gamespeed to a slow crawl or pause it constantly as events unfold. As a single player game, Hearts of Iron is not the best choice out there. It might do better with mulitple-players but, I'm not willing to give it the chance."
2,frustrating,"TOOO many gliches and inconsistantancies to be anything but frustrating. Freeze downs on movement of any factor to the others is not consistant with any software like this..just shows despite the ""packaging"" which is impressive that little effort was put into the battle sequences...an awful lot of program blow offs and aborts are present which shows lack of debugging..rush it to market and let the user beware"
1,Worthless garbage!,"Paradox took a great concept and ruined it completely. Their obsession with real-time gaming made what was a promising idea into a mess. There are simply too many things to manage and the flow of the game is ruined by having to think about issues like technology and resources; why can't the computer look after these, I only want to plan a war! And then the combat interface is a joke: imagine sending an army to invade a territory while losing the territory you invaded from being itself occupied by an enemy force - ridiculous! It couldn't happen in real life but it does in HoI. My advice: save your money and buy Strategic Command."
1,"THE NEW MEANING OF THE WORD ""DUNG""!","This game gives the word ""DUNG"" a new meaning, very sloppy programming, out of the box this game was horrible, five patches later, almost six now, it's till horrible. The AI has no AI at all worth playing against. Unless you like slaughtering the whole board that is and playing an ahistorical game all the way around. I took a minor like Brazil and crushed the Germans and Italians, BRAZIL!! woopee a real major power overwhelms the world in WWII and single handedly destroys the Axis powers with little or no help at all from the so-called computer allies who's greatest endeavor was sending a division at a time to be crushed by the 20 to 40 divisions guarding the coastlines of France. Pathetic game. I agree with another poster, save your money and get a quality game from Battlefront.com ""Strategic Command"", you can bet it will at least be challenging and not a ""toddlers toy"" like HOI."
2,so few owe so many an apology...,"This game is cumbersome and sluggish. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I havn't spent weeks trying to figure it all out. For people who loved Axis and Allies but wanted more, sit back and keep on dreaming. This game does not deliver."
2,not a great value,"For the TINY size of this book, it was not worth it. Yes, the pictures are cute, but as previous reviewer stated, some pictures take up 2 pages, thus limiting the amount of pictures in the book. My bad for not reading the specifications before purchase."
5,"Fantastic, warm sock","My toes/feet are always cold in the winter. I got a black pair of acorn fleece socks this Christmas and they are awesome. The fleece is thick and the stitching is very good. I am wearing them to work over dress socks and my feet are warm all day now. (heaven!) I ordered two more pairs, in black, so I can wear them each day this winter."
5,My Husband Loves Them!,"These socks are warm, fuzzy and fit my husband's size 13 feet well. He love them! I have a pair too. These are great!"
5,Warm and Toasty,This product does what it says! These socks keep your feet comfortable and can even be worn by themselves as slippers( although they have no grips on the bottom so be careful!!)
4,Unisex sizing confusion,"I've had Acorn Socks in the past and I LOVE them! Unfortunately, Unisex size S is too big for me (these really equal women's size XXS), and therefore they had to go back:("
4,Very happy purchaser,My husband loved his slippers. Couldn't believe how fast they arrived. Very happy purchaser. Thank you
5,Awsome slippers!,"These are the only slippers as far as I am concernered! I can not find them in the stores, thank goodness for Amazon."
3,Excellent - but not much selection,"Acorn's Fleece socks are great - my entire family wears them around the house in the winter and under boots, Crocs & even sandals depending on the weather. Men's selection of designs is very slim. I suppose Men with larger feet only like dark solids. The selection for Men's smaller sizes & women is very good."
1,Lasted less than a week!,"My husband has nerve damage and experiences very cold feet, his last fleece socks lasted probably 10+ years so I wanted to get him another pair. He only wore them a few times and they tore at the toe, not along the seam, the fabric just ripped. If they had cost 50 cents I wouldn't have cared but I wish I hadn't wasted my money on these. So very disappointed. Cheap, not well made, not worth it. Buyer beware."
5,Bought as a gift,"I purchased this as a gift for my cousin. She loves it! When I received the necklace it was just slightly different from what I had thought it would be but I am pleased regardless. The crystal cluster was slightly bigger than I thought it would be, it's about the size of a large 'shooter' marble. It is very light and looks beautiful when the light hits it. What is really nice is that you can put the cluster on the chain any way you like so depending on what you are wearing you can adjust which crystals show the most prominently. I would buy another one."
5,A Life-Changing Book,"My wife and I read this book at the recommendation of our minister, and we were absolutely amazed at how it impacted our life. We then went to an Abraham-Hicks Workshop, and were again inspired and delighted. This book will not be for everyone, but it can be a remarkable, positive influence in your life. Strongly recommended for anyone who is interested in metaphysical studies!"
5,Life Changing,"Indeed, life changing material. Delicious to savour. It touches every aspect of everyday life. Makes a lot of sense. I have already tried the valuable techniques of realizing one's desires and it works. Give us more of this Esther !"
3,Thank You Abraham,"Never have I read a work with so much repetition. It's as if the goal of the first 21 chapters was to see how many different ways one could phrase the same thought.Chapter 22 offered a fresh perspective that I have not encountered elsewhere.To be fair to the work, perhaps my experience would have been better had I not read ""The Secret"" and ""A New Earth"" prior to reading this one.I fully embrace the power of positive manifestation. And there are wonderful books on the subject. I don't feel this one of the best, but I am pleased for all the readers who have been inspired by Abraham's message."
5,Takes Us To A New Level!,"Ask and It is Given: Learning To Manifest Your Desires,by Esther Hicks is a most amazing book since it ""takes us to a new level!"", going beyond just positive thinking and into a new realm of also matching our vibrational energy with our desires.The information in the book is channeled information of Abraham ( a collective name for the entities channeled through Esther Hicks), I especially like the insight that desire is good and natural and that we are here to fulfill our desires...however, I would add that ultimately we are here for soul growth, and an aspect of that growth is achieved through fulfilling our desires. The reader is then provided with in depth information about how to effectively ask and receive in order to manifest in your life.If you like Ask and It Is Given then you'll love the following deeply insightful books:Nexus: A Neo NovelThe Seven Initiations of the Spiritual PathThe Prospering Power of Love"
5,Looking for a way to understand your life?,"I love this book. It has changed the way I think and feel. And it has given me the way to accomplish these changes. I bought several copies to give to my children and friends because I think it is so important for them to understand how life really works. If life isn't treating you the way you'd like, read this book."
5,Astonishing,"'Ask and It Is Given' is a remarkable book. Having bought it from a store on New York's 42nd Street, I was on a crowded subway uptown when I opened it and began reading. What followed was astonishing; a rare, epiphanic moment in which my perception of reality by means of a sudden intuitive realization completely transformed my state of consciousness. As soon as I read that the book is actually a collection of channeled messages from Abraham, I was left speechless. Sleep has that effect."
3,Interesting,"The book is interesting. But Esther hears voices talking to her, the voices in her head are called Abraham. Isn't hearing voices diagnosed as schizophrenia. Interesting that people are so into this book."
1,The Universe doesn't care about you,Another book feeding on the common desire to get things without any effort. Do you really think that the Universe with the millions of galaxies cares about your silly materialistic needs?
2,not what I expected,"I didn't know that this book was written by Esther on behalf of someone from the other side, Abraham. I thought it had something to do with the prophet Abraham from the Bible. After reading the first story about how this man Abraham, who is dead, possessed Esther's body to pass on these teachings, I just didn't get a good feeling about it and didn't want to keep reading. If you know that's the premise of the book already, it won't be a shocker for you and you may find the teachings enlightening. I wasn't prepared for that and didn't read beyond that first story."
1,don't fall for the hype,"These guys are straight up lying about science and are tricking people.When I read that diseases aren't caused by germs, I about screamed. They are going to kill someone with this horrible bad medical advise and horrible science.Tell me, when a baby is born sick, did he have poor expectation processes?They have blood on their hands."
1,don't belive the hype,"If you have a college degree ...this is not the book for you. Can't beleve I got suckered in by the raving reviews despite my personal instincts!The book does has a few tips that can help any individual ..but nothing you won't hear by the time your 18/19. The hype however, makes this book out to be somewhat unique and a cut above many of its counterpart and it isn't. Vibrations, Abraham ...excuse me ...koo-koo ....koo-koo!The fact is, this book talks down to the reader by constantly trying to drag you into the twilight zone! There are much better read out there that will give you more than just fluff and won't insult your intelligence!Well I'd better go put it in the garbage now before someone comes over to my house and see me with it!!"
1,Not a good book,"Hate this book, wish I could return it. In this book supposedly all you have you have created yourself!!!!! so if you have cancer or an autistic child you wanted that and you created it. this book had been reccomended to me, however I would not reccomend it to no one!!!"
5,Love them!,"All I can say is I have been an avid follower since 2007, love Ester and Jerry, they have taught me so much!"
5,Excellent for changing your view of the world.,What amazing concepts this book offers. I was very pleased with the effect it has had on my thought processes. It also changes your thinking about every day issues and how the world runs. I loved it.
3,"Good message, poorly written.","While the message of this book is powerful, the way it's written is, well, hokey. As I was reading, I kept wanting to roll my eyes. However, I made it through and I'm glad I did. I think that you probably can't go wrong in reading it but there are so many books out there about this particular phenomenon that there must be ones out there that are more compellingly written. My mother, however, loved it."
2,Daydream,A classic example of wishing won't make it so. They need a reality check.I didn't even finish this boring work.
5,Fantastic!,A great book for changing your thoughts and learning how to bring what you want into your life. Just the peace of mind alone is worth the investment.I highly recommend it!
5,Fantastic Book!,"This book is essential for anyone wanting more happiness and greater peace. Since practicing the Art of Allowing, I have transformed my entire life into something I love and am eager to live. I found the information in this book to be intuitive. It just feels right. There is relief on every page and the exercises in the back are invaluable, making it the best book to start you on your journey to Allowing all you desire to manifest in your life. Great help for parenting too!"
5,Give this book a try,"This book is meant to be read many times. It will change the way you think out yourself and the way you view your world. This book taught me that raising my vibration(simply put, feeling better) will allow me to open myself to many more wonderful things that are already waiting for me. Give it time and a chance as their is a lot to be learned from this book. It will also explain in very real terms what ""The Secret"" truly is and how you can integrate it into your life. I bought this book recently and am taking my time reading it again. Give yourself a chance to learn something that can change your life."
5,A profound shift,"I experienced the profound shift the book promised at the beginning. In fact, I found things were moving so fast that I asked for them to slow down a bit. At that point I seemed to lose the ability to stay in alignment, where initially it had seemed so easy to stay there!"
2,wasn't a fan,Maybe I just am not at the right time in my life right now to accept this knowledge.I liked The Secret much more and Chris Prentiss' Zen and the Art of Happiness was a very good read.
5,Skip everything else..,.. and pick this one. This is by far the most useful book I have come across on 'Law of Attraction'. Highly recommended!
5,life changing,"this is my first book of the abraham hicks but I had bought everything in mp3 at audible and it is so much fun .in one month I am starting to see huge changes in my life .first you would not belive it then if you give it a chance it will change your life for real.I love abraham,esther and jerry ,this is amazing and i'm soo lucky that i found them! thank u abraham"
4,sharing,"I haven't had a chance to read the whole book, ""Ask And It Will Be Given"" but what I have read I'm thoroughly enjoying. I'm learning a bit about myself. I still have to work on some of my defects. Mainly, ""jealousy"". That is a big one.I'm sure in this book, it will teach me some tools to use. That's all I have to say for right now.Thank you, Judy C. Kreigh[..]"
5,Be Specific About Your Desires,This book is a important key and a doorway to the fulfilment of your wants and desires. I have practiced the principles given and have attainedvery positive results.We are aways asking for something as we think and have emotions about our thoughts. Most people are unconscious creators of their world and circumstances. The wisdom in this book if practiced will guide you to become a conscious creator of you life and circumstances.I recommend it to everyone that desire more postive results in life. I will be giving the book as Christmas gifts to all my loved ones.
5,My LIFE is ASKING and Universe is GIVING,"Asking is so many things and this book addresses them. How you think, speak, act, expect, and believe. Ester tells us in the simplest language just how to go about creating LIVES that harness our deepest DESIRES. This is a book to be read and enjoyed over and over again. I know that too many times I just don't get it the first time or second or....Enjoy!Joan[..]"
5,the answer to all you'll ever need in this life,"things that we believe are unattainable,truly aren't we just have to search and the answer will find us this book is a Godsend"
4,Useful,"There is some useful information in this book, but I have others that I like better. Plus, I don't get very interested in channeling because I don't know who is really able to channel and who is isn't."
5,"From the author of ""My Truths, Accepting Higher Knowledge""",Continuing to inspire and enlighten us! I found answers to many of my questions within the pages of this book. Fantastic!
1,Amway Motivational Seminar Re-packaged,"For those of you who don't get the significance of the connection between Amway and Abraham I would urge you to do some honest, open-minded research and come to your own conclusions. For a time I believed that ""Abraham"" was the real deal. I bought their books, CD's and DVDs. I attended one of their workshops. But after discovering contradictions in the material I began to ask questions. After having done my own research I have come to believe that ""Abraham"" is nothing more than the re-packaged, spiritually-dramatized version of the Amway motivational seminars that Jerry Hicks gave in the 1970's and 1980's. Yes, it is wonderful, positive material that is lovingly, wittily delivered. It makes people feel good. And if that's all you need - I highly recommend it. But I, for one, need more than that."
5,An Awakening,"Very good read. I couldn't put it down. I particularly loved the examples and the processes that I can use. However, I wish they would have been listed them again in a resource section. Right now I have them marked by a piece of paper for easy review to see where my emotions are currently at; hopeful, anxious, excited etc. Who knew that our emotions were the key to manifesting our desires. I especially liked the list of emotions used as indicators of my vibration. It's so easy to look at the list, see where I'm at and then look up the process that will raise my vibration/emotion. The follow up CD included in the book is also nice to have because I can just pop it in and listen to it while I'm driving to get inspired again."
5,Amazing book,One of the most uplifting and inspirational books I have ever read! I recommend this book to anyone.
1,a waste of time,"Don't believe all the five-star reviews, this is yet another book about mind-control, telling yourself to change your thoughts in order to change your life. The exercises are a waste of time, as far as self-help books go, this one is one of the worst I've ever read. Every chapter repeats the same diatribe over and over. Come on, Esther Hicks is channeling spiritual entities that are giving her all this supposed wisdom and information? The Hicks have developed a huge money-making scam."
1,I was duped...again,"This is the second Abraham/Hicks book I have purchased, and I don't know why I thought this time would be different. I didn't believe in ""Abraham"" then, and I don't believe in ""them"" or in Esther's ""ability"" to conjure them up now. The language and concepts are beyond repetitive, and the reading experience becomes quite redundant once you realize they are just recycling these ""revelations"".Their whole series is a complete waste of time. I purchased my copy for 1.99 as a kindle edition, and I am mad about that!Save your money and buy Mike Dooley's Infinite Possibilities and Manifesting Change instead."
4,Good Book but could have easily been an article,"I've obtained enormous insight from all Abraham-Hicks teachings but there were many times where I had to put this book down because of reiterative text (at times, word for word) to the point of complete distraction. I don't want my ego to get the best of me here (though it has) but this book, while absolutely enlightening, was a bit boring."
5,Life Changing!!!!,"This is a life changing book - I know, because it is changing mine! I've spent most of my life looking for this. It is simple and fun, yes, fun. Not a lot of work - just feeling good - feeling joy!!!!!!!!"
4,A very good book,"A very good book. However, could leave out the part of someone(Abraham) talking to the author. A better book is ""The Power Intention"" by Dr. Wayne Dyer."
5,Ask and it is given by the Hicks,"YOU ONLY HEAR WHAT YOU ARE READY TO HEAR!!! Everyone will not get the same thing from reading these kinds of books says this author and that is so true because we are all at a different spiritual level no matter, at least we're on one. This book has Lots to open up your mind here and that's what reading is about to expand our consciouness. A must to read, I waited a long time to read any of the Hicks book but glad I gave in because I learned alot about the spiritual world and to let go and surrender to everything that is - It Just IS!!! Go with the flow of life and let go and enjoy the ride. It's all temporary stuff anyway. Life is a gift so enjoy it while your here. When life gets tuff go dancing!!!"
4,Seth?,Is it just coincidence that the Hicks/ Abraham entity bears a striking resemblance to Jane Roberts/ Seth and that the Hicks material began appearing shortly after Jane died in the mid eighties. The Seth material may be too old for many of the reviewers to be aware of it. I began readng it 30 years ago and it is much more hard slogging than the Hicks books which are very pleasant and easily understood. There are many wonderful books and are mentioned in the reviews but the two top dogs in the field are the Seth books and a really great little book that says it all and is over 100 years old ......In Tune With the Infinite by Ralph Waldo Trine.
5,Best ever book purchase,"I treasure this book very much. I bought it immediately after I learned it existed. The master appears when the student is ready, and this is certainly my case. I have been reading Louise Hay for a long time but did not know about the existence of Abraham. I recommend this book for those who are seeking the 'essence' or a 'truth' in their lives. I am aware and trying to control my thoughts now (not an easy thing). This book needs an open-minded person."
5,Amazing,I get exactly whatever it is that my heart desires!!!This is the best book if you ever wanted anything on this Earth and beyond.[...]
1,"I love inspirational books... this one is a bunch of cheesy, empty fluff and obnoxious preaching about nothing. [...]","This review is from someone who reads, enjoys and believes in inspirational books. I bought this book per recommendation. What an unbelievable piece of [...]! Even thoroughly disappointed by the first chapters, I kept reading, hoping that good practical content would come later. It did not. The book is just full of empty buzz, totally basic common sense at best, cheap and obnoxious evangelist-style preaching about nothing and brain-washing at worst. Absolutely horrible and disappointing! The style really reminded me of the cheesy multi-level-marketing presentations and other [...]. Zero magic, no good content whatsoever. The book was so bad that it made me not want to read self-help books anymore."
5,Super excited to read this book,The book came new! Very happy with how quickly the product arrived. Will get lots of use out of this book!
5,Ask and It Is Given,"What I like about Esther Hick's book is her information comes directly from the group called Abraham not from someone else. Abraham gives step by step instruction on how to make changes in behavior that will give you the results you desire in life. There are also examples why the process does not work for someone and how to make changes so it will. By using the ""pivot"" technique thought patterns can quickly be changed to bring a person in alignment so they can receive that which they want."
4,a wonderful gift to be given as a gift for the Holidays,"Ask and it is Given, to give with love , un-conditionally, what a powerful concept , but few of us are on the receiving end because we use our mind/head instead of our heart were love is concerned. Once we get thru the fluff of youthful ""love"". We see with mature eyes of the heart and follow Abraham. It is comfortable to love around the holiday's. We soon forget after the holiday's are passed. I have re-read this book several times and gleen more with each reading. This book is a gift to be enjoyed all year long"
5,"if you've come this far, click ""buy now""","if you've been drawn to this book by any kind of force whatsoever, just get it. it's a life transforming, high vibrational, guide to being human.anyone who's ever lamented not having been given an instruction booklet on how to be human, you've found it."
5,I LOVE This Book!,I've followed the teachings of Abraham for a few years now online and I've always enjoyed them. This book is the absolute BEST! I've read it completely through once and I'm re-reading chapters again and again - their 'processes' are so helpful!
3,A good faith-builder,"ASK AND IT IS GIVEN: LEARNING TO MANIFEST YOUR DESIRES by Esther and Jerry Hicks is a marvelous book and so very reassuring. If you have prayed and felt your prayers might not get higher than the ceiling, read this different approach that helps you KNOW your prayers, hopes, and dreams are being answered right now in the very right way. All you must do is really practice faith, just as the Bible and other religious books have always told us. But this puts it in lay language and easy to understand and practice and watch for your own signs that you are loved and protected and your prayers are always heard and answered. A good faith-builder in an unusual way."
5,"Spiritually uplifting, relaxing and inspirational","This book has given me stength and purposeful meaning of my life. It has educated me spiritual, it has calmed me and it has helped me to focus and try hard to remember my promise before I was given my body. I am learning how to connect to my source of energy that is constantly flowing, decrease my level of resistance and allow my true being which is joy, feeling good etc and become that which is natural. No matter your religion,faith or belief, this book educates us all collectivelly and spiritually."
4,Ask and It Is Given: Learning to Manifest Your Desires,"The book is good. It was a harder read than I thought. It took a little time for me to get into it. I do plan to finish it, but a little different than I thought it would be. I still like the contents."
5,THE BEST EVER BOOK,"Ask and It Is Given is a truly awesome and wonderful book, a real eye-opener! Great book to start connecting with Source. And the rest is Joy!"
3,good points,The book had good points that I will carry with me however because I my Christian beliefs I stopped reading midway.
5,I LOVE Esther Hicks!!!!,"This is an AMAZING book! A real page turner. I could feel my vibration rising as I finished each chapter. Toward the end, I had to space them out, one chapter each evening, so I could fully absorb the teachings and SAVOR them to the fullest. Even tho I had heard most of the information before (mostly from her GREAT youtube recordings, which are FREE) the book really 'brought them home' and made them a part of my reality! I am creating more powerfully than EVER before. I literally LOVE this woman, she is such a Goddess and clear channel for the teachings of Abraham."
5,Awesome!,I truly enjoyed this book. The process described within really do work. I feel better than I have felt in a long time. Kudos to Esther and Jerry Hicks for their work. The book was a very easy read and completely understandable principles. I loved it. I wish more of their books were available for Kindle.
5,Attract this book,This book is a gift. It is practical and inspirational. My clients have experienced greater joy and satisfaction from our interactions since working this book.
1,Just Plain Silly,"Read the first sentence of this book and you will either be needing read more or have an intense urge to roll your eyes.It's not the message that is troublesome here because there are so many other books that will be more worth your time that say the same things. The difference with this book is the messenger.Some channeled entity called Abraham? Get real. The practical information contained in ""Ask And It Is Given"" is mocked by the silly, new age way the subject is presented."
2,CAN YOU SAY PHONEY BOYS AND GIRLS?,"While this book does have some good information,which can be found in many old and new writings,which is where these two got there informationfrom and NOT!! by 'CHANELLING"" from anybodyanywhere.While i believe its possible to receiveinformation from the nonphysical,this smellsof pure BUNK! AGAIN the information here willbe helpful to you, the only ""CHANELLING'taking place will be the 'CHANELLING'of your money from your pocket to theirs.Do you really believe that as this book saysno matter what you ask for it MUST appear byuniversal law? JUST ASK and you WILL get it!Have you found this to be true in your life??"
3,"Another self help book, read A Brush with Darkness instead","Why are all these self help books written with jargon and not based on experience? I did not realize this fact until I read A Brush with Darkness, which is NOT a self help book, but a book written by an artist who happens to be blind, and is directed towards the issues of creativity. From reading this book, I discovered that the answers to a more meaningful with more positive experiences lie beneath the lines and come from authors who have gone through the rings of fire and emerged intact, whole and fulfulled."
5,The Missing Link to Creating Your Own Reality!,"The Law of Attraction is well known to students of mysticism. The idea that you will attract to yourself that which you focus your attention upon is the basis for numerous manifestation exercises. Where these exercises often fail is when unconscious beliefs get in the way. Ask and It is Given shows how you can USE YOUR EMOTIONS to determine whether you are sending out the correct vibration or whether your unconscious beliefs are producing resistance. I have no doubt that these down-to-earth teachings will be treasured by readers for years to come.-Edwin Harkness Spina, author of the award-winning, visionary thriller, Mystic Warrior"
5,Ask and it is Given: Learning to Manifest your desires,"This is an excellent learning tool. Esther and Jerry Hicks are unlike most motivational type lecturers; they don't just regurgitate wisdom, they teach you how to go about reaching the level necessary to achieve what you desire.If you are a Wayne Dyer fan, and have appreciated what he has to say, this book will teach you how to ""get there"". This will definitely kick it up several notches for you.This is an excellent resource, one that you will want to hold on to and reread time after time."
5,Finally something Practical and Clear,This is a very very special book. Abraham has been able to use our very limited language to articulate a very practical way to freedom. The Audio program is the best way to get the best use out of this.
2,Buy this book only if you have an electrical engineering degree,I purchased this book because I was interested in smart wiring my home for some basic automation. Although I'm familiar with electrical wiring diagrams this book is not for a person looking to make a couple of cool updates to his/her house or apartment.Personally I was disappointed with the content of this book.
1,Not what I expected,"It is really probably just my fault for not researching this item earlier. This camera was suppose to be a present for my son, when I got the package I opened it to check it out and it had a slot for a Floppy Disk! ?? So this camera is alot older than I thought and so many different buttons that it didnt look very user friendly for my 8 yr old. Needless to say I didn't give it to my son for Christmas"
3,Alaska Cruises & Ports of Call 2006,"This book has its strengths and weaknesses. If you are very early in the planning stages of an Alaskan Cruise this is a great book to help you select which cruise line and ship you should select. It is the strongest of the books I reviewed in describing the strengths and weaknesses of the various cruise ships. In fact over ? of the book deals with ships not the actual trip. There are shorts sections on the various ports of call. There is not a lot of depth to really get you excited about what you might want to do. Most ports have about four pages that offer walking tours, best cruise line excursions, local operator excursions and shopping."
4,the dreaded ex,"this is a really good book about sam and elizabeth. the tension between them is even worse than in the last books and if theres any book that makes chloe look good, this is the one. I recommend this book for anyone who loves sweet valley university!"
5,Inspirational,"This book is such a treasure for children and adults as well.I recently shared this book with a local school in Fiji, while I was there doing a bit of volunteer work. These children absolutely loved it. It opened their minds to the possibilitiesawaiting them in life.Use Your Voice and read this to your children and see how we can all make a positive difference in our world."
5,I Can Make a Difference,"This is an excellent, inspirational book that kids enjoy reading. However, I didn't get a copy from Amazon; the one I did get came from Borders. Much to my dismay and disappointment, Amazon didn't inform me for 3 weeks after I placed the order that it hadn't been delivered to my grandson for his First Communion gift as I had expected. The first one I bought went to another grandson, so now I am on the look-out for another one."
4,Underground culture of Istanbul,I don't think this album is meant to reflect the cliches about Istanbul. It is a collection of works by the city's undreground artists who are producing music of this century's Istanbul. Not for those who are looking for the mainstream.
2,Richard Hannay Has Disappointed Me!,"I was elated to find a number of ""Richard Hannay"" stories all in the same book, but was very disappointed that the rousing good yarn that was the basis for the breathtaking black and white film, ""The 39 Steps"" must have undergone a fair amount of revising when adapted to the screen. The original written version frankly limps along, especially at the end. I made a tentative run at the other stories, but found my self too underwhelmed to complete the book."
2,mystery,The first of the genre but rather slow and repetitive but of historic value of the literature form
3,The spy who bored me,"Buchan hasn't held up. His people are shadows and caricatures that read like the over-made-up characters in some silent movie. He doesn't seem to have much of a grip on religion, language, ethnicity or simple human motivations. Authors fade into obscurity for a reason -- and there are reasons why book introductions, like the one offered here, take on such a defensive tone. In Buchan's case the reason is his tales of exotic adventure read like one part Kipling and 20 parts dishwater. If you must read him, don't go anywhere near ""Kim"" until you're well through."
5,Very well satisfied,"I am so pleased that I found the volume of 4 John Buchan books. I had only read the 39 steps previously. A very good read in the ""Boys Own"" style. Would reccomend this to everyone, but what a great Father's Day Present"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This toy just doesn't work. When you turn the launcher on, it makes a LOUD noise. Unfortunately, that's the only thing that it does well. The launcher does not give the vehicles enough speed to even make it around a loop or up the teeter tower. Try explaining to a six-year-old why his birthday present doesn't work, and you'll understand why Hot Wheels will no longer be on our wish list."
1,Doesn't work well,"I agree with the other review...very loud, but worst of all, doesn't launch the cars very well. Hence, this toy doesn't do it's main task, which is to launch the cars into the loop. It is just poorly designed. I would NOT recommend buying this (wish I hadn't)."
4,Simple Fun,"In contrast to the other reviews, which are poor, our family enjoys these little Madnetics toys. The launcher is loud, the toys are cheap, but they are just simply fun. The green launcher that we have launches all our cars/motorcycles through the loops, tracks, and across our entire kitchen floor with speed. Simple fun for just a couple bucks."
2,the tracks are junk the motorcycles are fun,We purchased just the motorcycles and cars in packs of two at walmart for just a couple bucks and we use them on the friderator and around the house and then the kids just put them back on the fridgerator to store them. the tracks and launchers a worthless junk.
4,Never Boring!,"I liked this book alot. Each of the chapters covered a different operation and was very fast paced. Vietnam era SEAL/UDT operations were covered extensively and with a human touch. My only complaint (kind of a big one for me), and the reason I didn't give it a five star, is that the packaging of this paperback leads the reader to believe this is a work of non-fiction. The front and back cover do not mention this is fiction, and only once I got home did I notice the word fiction on the spine. The author states in his review these stories are based on fact. I just wonder what is fiction and what is non-fiction. Other than this personal complaint this is probably the most readable and flowing book on SEALs that I have read. Enjoy it but know it's ficton."
2,Gold medal does not delivery items listed in catalog,I ordered a hair dryer and curling iron from gold medal in January. It it now April and they still have not sent it to me or my money. They have very poor customer service. People tell you different things. They send you out catalogs with items listed that are not available. This has happen to me several times. Their things are always on back order. This has been going on for the past 3 years with me. Dont send a check. Call them first. They have good products IF you can get them.
1,Small Bird Millet Spray Holder and Perch,I bought two of these and wasted my money....the perches are tiny pieces of plastic that my cockatiel can't even perch on and the holder barely holds 1/2 of a millet spray. It's a plastic piece of garbage. Don't waste your money. Buy the more expensive millet holder. You'll be glad you did. Trust me.
4,"I'm trying not to be biased, but they're great!","Mellow and mild is usually more my style, but when I want to change the pace this is the CD I pick up. I had to buy a second one because I wore the first one out. I'm dying to hear more, Ced."
4,put the funk in your face,"The Anathema Project takes a foundation of hard rock and funk, and mixes in a grab bag of call-and-response banshee vocals, ambient sounds and unusual song structure. The resulting songs are tough, and gloriously messy. Check out ""Ciao Gata"", ""The Party Song"" and ""The Forgive""."
5,Timberland White Ledge boots,"These boots are great for my husband, who is an electrican and is out in the ""field"". His last pair lasted 2 years. Great fit."
5,Timberland hikers,"Great boots, already had a pair like these and wanted another. Shopped around locally and on-line. Found these at the best price. Packaging was super. Recieved in a expedious manner. They fit and are as comfortable as the original pair."
5,A great boot for a great price!,"I looked in many different stores for a durable waterproof timberland boot for my husband who wanted them to hike in. Although I found many which were similiar if not the same as this one, the prices were much greater. I got these for a great price and they are beautiful boots. They were also shipped to my home faster than I expected."
5,Great boots,I wore them for 4 days now and really love them. Great for hiking in hard pack snow. Good grips and light.
4,I like my boots.,I like the boots pretty well so far..I havnt got them broke in just yet.Give me a couple more weeks and ask me again.
1,Cheap,"VERY POORLY MADE. Bought for winter use. I don't work outdoors so use was very light. They were comfortable and waterproof for almost 1 and 1/2 months. At that time the welt began to separate. Bought some shoe goo and will try to use these until spring, then into the trash can. I have bought very cheap boots at discounter that have lasted longer than these."
1,Eyelets dug into my foot ......,"I was really disappointed with these Timberland's. Bought generally on name / past experience. When I tightened them up -- eyelets dug into my foot making for an uncomfortable feel. Tried locally, a smaller size -- same thing. I'm shocked that what they (general) and pushing off as 'winter boots' lately -- all cloth. That's crazy for the snow. I appreciate trying to get lightweight, but cloth is useless. I liked these because the leather uppers and good looks. Just a bad design. Returned them and still looking. Fogdog shipped quickly & promptly."
3,Medium Quality/Comfort,"I bought these boots to wear at work for a mostly desk job that takes me out in the field occasionally. They don't appear to be that well made and I would guess that the seam where the leather connects to the sole may not hold up. It is glued and looks like it will separate over time. The boots are comfortable, but the sole is not very thick.I have not done any heavier hiking in them, but they don't feel nearly as comfortable and sturdy as my North Face hiking shoes that have gone many miles in all kinds of terrain. They feel flimsy. Again, no problems with them yet, but they just look like they are thin.They are a decent boot for the price and for what I am using them for. Had I seen them in person first, I may not have purchased them. However, to get more, you really have to pay more and I really wasn't looking to pay much more than I did, so overall, they are a three. Ok fit, ok quality, good price."
2,Boot Review,"Nice looking boot, however the insoles of both the Timberland boots that I've purchased have been lacking in comfort and support."
4,all weather boot,I used it during noreaster and it kept me warm and dry. That is what I was looking for plus the boot is comfortable. It does not chafe and looks good
5,Mu guy loves these!,Really soft leather but extremely durable and comfortable - he says he won't buy any other brand of boot now. I bought these for him as a gift - I loved the price (he's a size 15 EEE) so shoes can be expensive for him.
4,Very good boot all around,"Comfortable, nice looks, waterproofing has held up so far. An excellent boot to go fishing, hike around town. May not be the right boot to spend a week on the applachain tail or other serious hiking but I like it for average wear."
2,didn't fit,"I got these for my son who wears a 14 M, but he said they were too small. We sent them back."
4,Nice boots,"I've loved Timberland boots for years, and was happy to replace my old, well-loved pair. However, I was disappointed when I started getting some foot pain after wearing them for about a week. After purchasing some gel insoles, I found them to be more comfortable. It appears there was little in the way of arch support in the boots when they arrived, and my previous experience was that they had them already in the shoes. I don't know if it's a new design, or if this pair missed something along the line. Try them, and consider if you need a pair of insoles to put in. Otherwise, well-built, high quality as usual from Timberland."
5,Great boots,"I have a hard time getting any boot to be comfortable enough to wear all day, at least 12 hours. These boots do just that. This is my 3rd pair over the past 6 years and I still use the first pair - they're well worn - around the yard for yard work. I use these when driving water tender on fires with my fire gear and they hold up just perfectly. I like the flexibility and traction they provide and they look nice.The price is very reasonable. I hope Timberland never gets rid of this model."
5,Great boots,This is the 4th pair of these boots that I have owned. I have worn almost nothing but these boots now for over 6 years as they are nearly as comfortable right out of the box as the old worn out pair that is being repalced. Great quality!! Great comfort!! A+++ in my book!!!!
1,Crap... absolute crap,"Yup. You read the title right.I spent a whole weekend wearing wet shoes because I walked over a patch of wet grass while hiking.They leak terribly and if you're looking for good shoes to hike in the stay away from these.On the side where the gray rubber meets the leather I now have a gap. All around on both shoes.It took all of 4 days of light hiking for this to happen.So all in all they are crap, poorly made and a big waste of your money."
1,Timberland Men's White Ledge Boot,"I bought those boots in December 2008 and was very disappointed by quality. I did not like that shoe-tongue made from nylon and it can be ripped off easy. Second my feet were sweating and when temperature get below 32 F it was cold to wear. And they are hard not soft.I always liked Timberland brand but those shoe ""Timberland Men's White Ledge Boot"" can be made better."
1,Timberland Mens White Ledge Boots,"These boots were two to three times and the seam across the sole is already coming apart. They are not sturdy at all. If it weren't passed the 30 days for returning them, and having to pay shipping, we would have returned them. NOT HAPPY AT ALL, especially for the paying what we did for them."
4,Combfotable And Durable,"I purchased this pair of boots right before Christmas and they arrived just on time for the holidays. They were not a gift they were for myself, this is the 2nd pair of these boots that I have owned in the last 3 years (the 1st pair lasted me 3 years & I still have them)they are as comfortable as they are durable. Whether you want them for work, hiking or just for weekend casual wear they are a nice pair of boots to own, good in any kind of weather. And the price here at Amazon is always just right for the pocket and budget."
5,Great Boot,"This is my 8th pair love these things,They feel like sneakers(or close)break in in is almost instant.My friends all have them now as well worth the money easy last year or better and use old pair for dirty jobs"
4,"Great footwear, very comfortable!","4 stars for now the 5th can only come from longevity....timberlands I've had in the past have proven worth the $.$70 including the shipping cost is a great price for a good pair of boots! So far, so good!"
2,"Nice looking, but cheap construction","Don't be taken in by the smart look of these Timberland boots. They do look great, are light weight, but they are badly made with little support, cheap soles, and an overall bad fit. Like wearing plastic boots. Seriously."
2,Less than happy with my boots,"I bought these to replace my aging HiTec Altitude leather boots. I looooved those boots.But I thought I'd try these as I figured they'd be the same, and because they're Timberlands, maybe even better.In every way they're worse. Where do I start?The sole is flimsy...I can feel rocks thru it when I'm hiking. HiTec were much betterThe laces are terrible. They're always coming undone. Really? I've had good and bad laces and how can it be they give you slippery bad laces?Not comfortable. They're just not.I did a 5 day hike in these things (and yes they were broken in at that point) and my feet were a wreck afterwards.Wish I'd gone with my old reliable HiTec's. Ah well.On the good side: they look nice, leather is good. Waterproofing works nicely."
3,"Holy Smoke, Batman!","{brief spoilers}:You know, I hadn't really expected to like this movie very much, and I kinda did. Kate Winslet is british but in this movie she is australian...okay. I didn't think it was very funny, but that's just me. It wasn't great, but not that bad.Ruth Barron {Kate Winslet} is in India when she is effected by a guru. Unbeknownest to her, she comes back to her home in Australia, only to meet P.J. Waters {Harvey Keitel} who is a de-programmer who has tricked her to come back and they argue forever about love and.... stuff. Later on, P.J. discovers that Ruth will give her body and her soul to anyone because of the guru. It all goes a bit over-the-top from there on. That's about all I should give away for now. Hope this was helpful."
1,"If you hate The Piano, you'll really hate Holy Smoke!","More anti-feminist crap from a woman who seems to think she's a feminist director - Jane Campion. Her movies continually trap women in bizarre circumstances, where the female characters then show themselves to be passive-aggressive doormats. So Kate Winslet's character is accused of being a man-hater because she yells at the man who has trapped her, insulted her and had sex with her during her most vulnerable moment (which he engineered)? Typical Campion. So Kate Winslet's character begs forgiveness when she has fought back against that same man (who trapped her, insulted her and had sex with her during her most vulnerable moment)? Typical Campion.The only good thing about this movie is Kate Winslet, who is lovely, complex, intelligent and sexy. Her performance redeems the 2 hours of my life I spent watching this thing."
3,"Good Acting, Bad Story/Plot","Although this movie has an undeniably talented cast (including my favorite actress in the world, Kate Winslet) and has an interesting storyline, this movie isn't very good.Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet do splendid jobs in this darkly hilarious movie about a young woman, Ruth (Winslet), who falls under the charms of a religious guru. Keitel plays PJ Waters, the cult exitor hired by Ruth's parents to ""cleanse"" her of her experience.The chemistry between Winslet and Keitel is incredibly, however their chemistry and talent can't overcome the lack of storyline development.Jane and Anna Campion really didn't focus enough on the topics of gurus and cults, but they spent too much time on sex. When the characters weren't having sex, they were discussing sexual acts in details.I think the Campions could've done something incredible with a story such as this one, but they tarnished it so much with the overt sexuality that it couldn't be salvaged.Try to avoid this movie."
1,.,"It is depressing to me that such a potentially rich, interesting premise could be so atrociously wasted. Holy Smoke is a dull, incoherent mess. Unfunny quirkiness is poorly balanced with abstract, confusing dialogue (coming from abstract, confusing characters.) The themes of the film are intriguing, but they are not so much explored as they are inanely, unhelpfully flirted with. In the situation Campion had set up, there was room for some real sparks to fly, room for some intense philosophical steam. Instead Kate Winslet pees herself and Harvey Kietel wears lipstick and a dress. The script is boring and flakey, and the characters make no sense at all. They didn't feel real; and yet on the other hand, they were not particularly interesting as fictional entities. It's a no win situation. This movie was a genuine disappointment to me."
3,Holy Smoke This ending sucked!,I liked this movie thru out the entire time... up until the end. I won't give it away or add any spoilers but Harvey Keitel was perfect in the part of the 'deprogrammer' and Kate Winslet was very good as the 'brainwashed' cultist. I also liked the Neil Diamond music and how it was used in the movie.Its not a bad flick and it has a good message but boy they blew it in the end.
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE!,"This is the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. I love Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet so I thought this would be a good film. The story is a very interesting one and could have been developed into something great. Visually it is stunning. However, after a fairly good start developing some eclectic characters the movie degenerates into something nearly unwatchable. Don't think I am saying this because the nudity or profanity (of which there is a lot) offended me. It is just that the story line goes nowhere. Characters seem to behave in ways that are contradictory to their development. Storylines go nowhere. Keitel's character makes no sense whatsoever. If I were any of the people associated with this film I would leave it OFF my resume."
5,I love this movie,A lot of people just won't be able to relate but if you've been there this movie is priceless. You just gotta wonder some times how something like this ever gets written and makes it to the big screen but I'm just glad it did...Luv ya honey. You know who I mean.
3,Benson and Banson,"The opening to Holy Smoke!- a visual intoxication of India showcased to Neil Diamond's ""Holy Holy"" - is among the best openings to a movie I have ever seen. The subsequent few minutes of the action in India, before detouring to Australia is also very well done, and together captures the atmosphere for a very endearing movie that may have wonderfully portrayed the spiritual struggle of the main character, played admirably by Kate Winslet. Instead it turns endlessly neurotic, parading out an endless display of the various charaters' idiosyncrasies, thus extinguishing the fire this movie might have had into a depressing puff."
5,A Powerful Film of Transformation,"Ruth (Kate Winslet) has her transfornation in India, it becomes grounded through her very human,intimate relationship (her first one) with PJ (Harvey Keitel). PJ has been to India but it was wounding rather than transforming. His transformation takes place through his attraction (and his projections) to Ruth, first as a woman, then as a goddess and then the Goddess herself appears. He is brought to the brink of insanity and death as deep transformations can do. What we Westerners glibly call cross-dressing is a sacred ritual done to attract the Gods and Goddesses to visit. It's a film of deep symbols that take us beyond the mundane...."
3,Gotta admire its bombast,"There are many things wrong with the movie but there are so many memorable scenes that it is difficult to overlook the film. For all it's weirdness and attempts to be audacious, the point of the film is actually kinda banal. But man, there is this scene in which Harvey Keitel is wearing a red... oh, you just have to see it to believe it. If you're like me and you primarily watch movies in the hope of seeing something you've never seen before, then this movie will meet your expectations."
2,Off to a great start then ran amok,"Maybe I'm a prude?I thought the idea of a family kidnapping their daughter back from an Ashram in India and having her ""deprogrammed"" by Harvey Keitel was great and the movie started out great but it really derailed as the sexual relationship between the deprogrammer and deprogrammee developed.I found the last 20 minutes uncomfortable to sit through."
1,Waste of time,"I only gave it 1 star because that's the lowest point you can give. This movie is a total waste of time; questionable plot, shallow depiction of Indian faith / culture, lame characters. Only for hardcore Winslet fan."
4,An interesting history.,"Title cut originally written for ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" as background for a Federation tape revealing what the ""Genesis Project"" is (also used in ST III: The Search for Spock). Huxley was also featured in an original ST episode entitled ""And The Children Shall Lead"". His musical claim to fame actually started on ""The Tonight Show, starring Johnny Carson"" where he had several appearances as leader of The Craig Huxley Trio, a three-piece jazz band featuring a kid who had to stand on a chair to play a stand-up bass! If you aren't into electronic music, or Star Trek, I'd give it a miss."
5,If it's possible to wear out a CD...this is it!,"Wonderfully smooth vocals with the type of jazz you just can't get enough of. Amazing session artists such as Michael Brecker and Nelson Rangell add their superior sounds to old and new soon to be standards. Each track is fresh and commands listening to, but you'll be pleasantly surprised with their rendition of ""Chain of Fools"". Thursday Diva is music for driving, late night and early Sunday morning with the paper. My only regret is that there isn't a follow up cd. If it's possible to wear out a CD...this is it!"
3,Room For Improvement,"Brand new this stand is fantastic. Over time the rubber washer inside the stand starts to wear leaving an extra click every time you push the pedal. I've had to take this apart numerous times to fix and lubricate it. My first Pearl Hi hat stand I have never had to work on and it was a student model. Also the rubber clutch effects the tone of the cymbals in a poor way, I use the clutch with just regular felts."
3,therapeutic gothic-lite,"""i go crazy"" introduced me to flesh for lulu and since then, i've had a growing appreciation of their dark,melodic tunes which they have an abundance of in this 1989 album. stand-out tracks are ""decline and fall"",""day one"",the title track and the lead single ""time and space"". if you are into gene loves jezebel, the mission u.k., the cure and longpigs, then this a dose of goth-pop that will perk you up."
4,GREAT ALBUM,"I SAW TEHIR SINGLE I GO CRAZY AND DECIDED TO BUY THIS ALBUM , LIKE MANY OTHERS UNKNOWN ARTSITS WHO DUE TO HARD LUCK COULD NOT GET THE RECOGNITION THEY DESERVED , ITS THE SAME CASE HERE. I THINK ITS A GREAT ALBUM AND WHOEVER OUT THERE HAVE'NT HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THESE GUYS MUST GET THIS ALBUM, I GIVE YOU MY UTMOST ASSURANCE YOU WONT REGRET IT. ITS A GREAT PUNK / ROCK BLEND OF MUSIC.........."
4,Pocket Premier League,"I wasn't disappointed when i bought this game. Nintendo Ds first soccer game and it is very entertaining. Music is good - probably about 6 different tracks in the game, match commentary runs while you play which was a very pleasant suprise - even better it is the BBC's John Motson, a classic british soccer commentator. All the teams you can think of are in here and ever league and cup competition you can think of (pretty much) so plenty of replay value. The AI is good, not to easy, not too tough - however once you have mastered the controls and team you will be running rings around people! The general feel and presentation of this game is excellent - and its cheap too! Only gripe is no manager mode - maybe in Fifa 2007????"
1,broke down after 1 year of use,"It worked great until it broke! I had it for a little over a year when the battery died and it constantly gave me the low battery warning. I thought maybe the battery was bad, so I bought a replacement battery. That didn't fix anything. The unit was just faulty. Beware!"
2,Not durable,Short review. They aren't durable at all. Click off for no reason while other things in the house still have power then come back on just as unexpectedly. I won't bother with another.
2,Beware!,"If you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet, your unit will not be covered by the APS warranty on this device. Lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried. The cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with APS. They denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage (even though the modem wasn't hurt?)."
4,Good second unit,I bought one of these 10 months ago for my daughter's eMac. It has functioned well despite many power 'blinks' and short outages due to thunderstorms and such. I have a larger APS unit on our cable modem and wireless base station-equipped main home computer. It provides the main backup and surge protection to our home computing systems. The BE350U would be a bad choice for a larger machine or a modem-using computer but for our sort of secondary computer situation it has worked well. The shutdown software kicks in when needed and we have never lost any files as a result.
2,Too small for most computers.,I would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime. Under a 200W load it only lasted 3 minutes while the Back-UPS ES 500 lasted almost 12 minutes. The ES 500 is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime. In my opinion this UPS is only good for very small loads (less than the average computer).
1,APC 350ES - Very poor UPS,"I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005. I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker. Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long. Only load was computer, monitor, and router). At any rate, the shut down was successful. But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so.Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,WARNING: Dont buy Trophy Hunter 2003 from Atari! I just bought this game and I was sooo disappointed! The graphics are HORRIBLE and makes the game really unenjoyable. Also the game is really slow like when you move around or try to walk or anything like that! And my computers up to date on all of this games requirments!!! So dont get Trophy Hunter 2003! Its a waste of money! I suggest you go out and buy Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter 3!!!!I promise you'll enjoy it more than this game!! I have also heard a lot of complants on the horrible graphics and of how slow the game is!!
1,Rated L for LAME,"What happened to the author of A Thousand Acres? It is hard to believe that this book came out of her pen as well. That first chapter, with its inane conversation on how to make a movie about penetrating Elena, was insufferable. What finally killed me was the very last part of Chapter 1. Max gets up, it is 8 am, and 6 guests are already IN the house, and he didn't know it. Come on!!!There is nothing about the characters, the plot, the narrative, that makes me want to continue. Ms. Smiley, what happened?"
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"I picked this up at an airport, hoping it would be a light, entertaining chick lit/beach read. Although it is well written, I found myself confused by the complex web of characters (a visual in the very beginning would've been very helpful), and often bored by the political ramblings of breakfast discussions. Good concept, but just poorly executed, and definitely not what I was expecting. I have yet to finish it."
1,Awful,I am sorry that I spent the money to purchase this book. I tried to read it but the conversations that these people have bore me to tears. I wanted to like it especially because someone stated it would be a good read. How wrong they were.
1,Absolute Trash,This book was so disappointing. I don't understand all the good reviews. I have read all Jane Smiley's books and loved them. What happened? She has done herself no favors with this one. Just a pile of meandering worthless jibberish.
2,I so wanted to love this..........,"Jane Smiley is one of my favorites. But this book is just painful. I mean really -- pages and pages and pages and pages and pages and pages and pages of graphic sex scenes, rounded out by an equal number of pages of vapid dialogue.I know, I get it. I understand the point. I too admire the concept and the writing, but this story is just a waste of time. Art is a worthwhile endeavor, but who cares if no one wants to see it?"
1,Only finished a few chapters then gave up....,I just could not get into this book at all. The first section is very boring and mundane. It took me a month to read a few chapters and then I gave up completely. There is a lot of sexual content but it is bizarre and misplaced. I feel that this book was a waste of my money!
2,Couldn't finish it,"I have read just about every word of fiction Jane Smiley has published (even read the Greenlanders!)--except the last 2/3 of this book. It felt claustrophobic and forced, way too talky and the sex was, um, ewww. I feel bad because I look forward to a new book by her the way I look forward to sweet corn in August. But, to stretch this food comparison a little farther, I found reading 10 Days like eating a bowl of wasabi peas, as opposed to her other books, which are like biting into a fresh peach. If you are new to Jane Smiley, may I recommend Horse Heaven, surely her most underrated book. It's epic and funny and entertaining and informative. Let's hope her next book is big and juicy and satisfying and not like some thesis topic gone awry."
2,Wanted to Like It,"I really gave this a strong shot. I wanted to like it. I liked the idea of it -- and I thought the way she layered stories was terrific. Movie people telling plots of other movies, recounting their own tales, discussing possible film scripts. And I also think Jane Smiley gave herself a real challenge of basing a book on 90 percent conversation. Also on the plus side were some vivid and excellent discussions on the war in Iraq and the Council on Foreign Affairs. However, it just drags. There is no mounting sense of tension or arc to the characters' lives. Some characters are well drawn and very 3D; some seemed flat and thin. Only for Jane Smiley completists, I would say."
3,I enjoyed it,"I enjoyed this book. I've never read Smiley before, and I suspect this isn't her best (no Pulitzer, that is). Nevertheless, I liked it. I liked all the sex, the self-absorbed Hollywood people, and the liberal sensibilities. I really enjoy fiction that captures intimate portrayals of moments shared. These people are real, if difficult to relate to because most of us don't live the lives of privilege they do. They are working through a difficult time, and they have done what many of us do in difficult times--they band together. They don't fit perfectly, but they each have their own right to exist in this web. They each are given a turn to express their humanity, and that's where Smiley's genius shines. We can relate to them when they are simply being human, and that's what makes the story, in the end."
2,My First Smiley Book...and So Unenchanted,"In anticipation of having a great book to read, I picked up my first-ever Jane Smiley book. I kept waiting for the magic to start...no such luck. Now I'm about 200 pages into it and am only finishing it as I spent $24.00 on this very, very disappointing novel. I would not recommend it to anyone...boring!"
1,Ouch.,"I read voraciously, and was prepared to devour this novel, but it is painful in the extreme. Tedious, overwrought...was it edited at all? It is as if Jane Smiley wrote an autobiographical stream of consciousness and then had it printed. SKIP IT. Wish I could get a refund."
2,Trying Too Hard to be Hip,"I have loved Jane Smiley's books, but in this one I feel that she is trying to prove she can write about sex with authority and thereby join the In crowd. How many people did she have to interview to come up with so many graphic descriptions of cocks? I just finished page 200 and I'm checking out."
4,A great listen -- tales work well as an audio book,"Smiley's anecdotal, plotless storytelling works very well to listen to. The unabridged audio version, read by the wonderful Suzanne Toren, brings to life the distinct 10 voices of the characters gathered for 10 days of shifting relationships -- some casual and ribald, others deepening in love and meaning. The narrative is not linear but a series of spirals, just as a modern version of the Decameron should be. The overly detailed sex -- actually, the details are more genital than sexual -- gets a bit tiresome, but there's enough humor, cleverness and masterful writing to carry the day."
3,An air of irreality,"Jane Smiley often has a wonderful ear for dialogue and for graphic erotica that is also wry and sensible. Moo and Horse Heaven come to mind. But this is unbelievable, both in terms of the character makeup and the conversations that don't occur. I'm halfway through and the only mention of anyone's race is done by Smiley. Plus Zoe Cunningham seems to have only melanin as her identification as ""black""--she's otherwise as white-sounding and thinking as Elena. That's a big elephant in the room. She did this in Horse Heaven, too, plucking a plucky beautiful AA girl out of a K-Mart minimum-wage job and merging her seamlessly into the old Virginia horseracing lifestyle.Smiley is scratching some PC ""can't we all just be the same?"" itch here, not to good effect."
1,Ten Days in the Hills,"Don't waste your time or money. The book was painful to get through. I felt no connection to the characters, the dialogue was annoying and tedious. The text was all over the place, giving me the impression that Smiley just wanted to air various grievances or express opinions on any number of topics so she used this book as an excuse to do so. This was my first Jane Smiley book and it will be my last."
1,Dreadful...,"I have read over 100 books in the past year and this was the first one I did not finish. I certainly gave it enough of a chance though, only throwing in the towel on page 304. I am usually not one to skim any part of a book but in this one, so many scenes seemed to go on for so long that I found myself skipping past many of these dull parts. I thought the book might pick up after the location changed but it did not. Don't waste your time on this book, it was truly one of the most boring books I have ever attempted to read."
2,great expectations,"With apologies to Charles Dickens, I'm sorry to say that my expectations have been dashed on the rocks!I enjoyed ""A Thousand Acres"" and ordered ""Ten Days in the Hills"" with eager anticipation.What a let down. It was like reading the local news rag. I can't even get through Day One. Sorry,Jane. Now I'm a bit gunshy."
1,Into the trash,"Jane Smiley does indeed have a keen ear and masterful touch with dialogue, but....449 pages of eavesdropping on the rambling conversations of these assorted Hollywood stereotypes does not add up to an engrossing read. Like many others, after 150 pages of hoping for some redeeming quality in this work, I threw my copy in the trash. This book evoked the same visceral reaction I have to people carrying on cell phone conversations in public places - the instinct for fight or flight."
1,Save Your Money,"I just got to page 177 and gave up. I was hoping it would get interesting, but it never did. Strange characters, long dull conversations, nothing doing. It's supposed to be set in Pacific Palisades, but if they can see the Getty from the house they are in, they have to be in Brentwood. A small detail, but still...get serious."
5,It makes you think...,A very good book. I'm concerned that many of the reviewers never gave the book a chance. So you didn't think the book was scintillating - that doesn't make it worth only one star.
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I love to read. I will read anything, but the back of a cereal box is more entertaining than this book. I had to force myself to continue reading. The dialogue goes on and on until you want to scream ""stop!"" and the characters are predictable, right out of central casting. Not only could I not finish this book, but only one person in my 12 member book club finished it, not because she enjoyed it, but because she is a little OCD and felt compelled. This is so unworthy of a Pulitzer Prize winner--I felt duped!"
1,Boring and Trite,"I gave this book 200 pages to hook me and it failed miserably. I had to stop reading it and ask my husband (who had just finished it) to tell me if anything actually ever happens. He said nothing happens. So I put it down. I'm all for meandering, stream of consciousness conversation but this story had no plot and if you're going to blather on please make the blather interesting. I loved ""My Dinner With Andre"" and I'm not an ADD teenager. In fact, I'm the spitting image of Max's lover Elena and even that fact wasn't interesting enough to keep me reading. I'm very disappointed. It was so pointless that even the sex left me cold. Ho hum. Big deal."
1,Goes Nowhere Fast,"Jane Smiley is an enormously talented writer. I loved ""The Greenlanders"" and ""A Year At The Races"", both books stayed with me long after I finished reading them. She can crank out very high quality work, but ""Ten Day's in the Hills"" is a loser. Yes, maybe it's experimental, but mainly it's just boring. All the characters sound the same, over privileged, affluent, droning on, far too much interior dialog and musing that goes nowhere. It seems more like a study of rarified academic types than Hollywood. Where's the fun, the desperation, the irony, the treachery? I can't imagine Hollywood is populated with people this dull. You will also be treated to Smiley's political views, early in the novel she pontificates about the Iraq war and the evils of Bush. I bailed on page 50."
1,Waste of time and money,"Endless, aimless, pretentious and monotonous. The same badly written sex scene is repeated over and over."
5,Fascinating Read.,"I recently read this book and was amazed at Malmsheimer's insightful commentary on what it means to be a doctor in America. He transcends the prevalent petty finger-pointing of other authors on the subject to delve into the philosphical, historical, and even literary basis for his arguments. He explores fascinating avenues of thought in order to understand how the image of the American physician has been developed out of necessity for the doctor-patient relationship and reinforced by basic human nature, both on the part of patients, physicians, and others. Malmsheimer's work is a delightful work at all times, only slowing pace durng the examination of the American doctor in literature. This book is definite must-read for anyone considering the vocation of medicine or anyone living the life of the American doctor."
4,A great inkjet!,"This is one great inkjet! I have had three Epson printers and this is perhaps the best. What I liked is that it has larger ink cartridges so you don't have to spent the big bucks so often. It is extremely FAST! There is a PostScript RIP available if you need it (works great, too!).Photographs printed on this printer look like they came from Kodak. And they print faster than any other inkjet available today.CONS: I can find no difference (even under a magnifier) between the 1440dpi mode and the 740dpi mode. The 1440dpi mode takes twice as long to print, so why bother. Also, I had trouble with blue-screens (lockups) in the 1440 mode and Epson tech couldn't solve the problem, so I now print in the 740dpi mode and it looks great with no lockups!Overall, this is a great printer for business or home-office use. You won't regret the few extra dollars that you had to spend!"
3,Great performance with significant annoyances,"I've had this printer for over a year. On the plus side, this Epson prints very fast in both B&W and in color, and the printed pages and photos it turns out look great. On the negative side, two or three times a week, it has to go through a noisy and annoying one-minute-plus cycle to warm up before printing even one page, it needs head cleaning multiple times(done by an included software utility) about every three weeks which can take another three to five minutes of cycling or else I see gaps in the printouts, it runs very noisily when it is printing, and it goes through black ink cartridges faster than I'd like. Bottom line, when I have to do it over again, I'll go back to HP despite the high quality and speed of the Epson's printing, because my HP printers don't do the things that annoy me about the Epson Stylus Color 900."
4,Close to laser and Killer photos,Why buy a photo only printer when you can have it all? This printer is very intuitive in the auto settings and has performed flawlessly. The ink level meter is a definite plus too. I found it a little noisy when spooling print jobs though.
3,Quality Photographs but slow,"Our company had bought 4 of these printers for our sales team. we use these printers for selling our product. the pictures come out great! this is a very good printer to use. the down side...Its slow. especially if you have BIG print jobs. 300-600 sheets a day. We eventually purchased a colored laser printer.I purchased this printer for home use and it died exactly 12 months later. But, Epson honored my warranty six days after it had expired. Now, i have a new stylus 900 and even purchased the Epson C80."
1,heath/zenith barn light,"would not recommend , very cheaply built , product made overseas and very cheap quality , socket broke on installation of bulb"
3,Gilding the Lily,"If you're looking for a brief, concise explanation of the Mennonite faith, best look elsewhere. This pseudo-leather bound, gilt-lettered version has a photostat of the original lettering in the second half of the book and is essentially a collector's item for hoarders of Mennonite trivia. A good suggestion for graduations, baptisms, and other events where gifts are given that will gather dust for years to come. For a solid and readable official creed, I suggest Herald Press's 1995 paperback confession for $4.99 (ISBN 0836190432)."
4,Cassel Excels,I really loved both the Mesrine movies. I thought the first part was the best. Cassel is just fantastic as Mesrine and watching him evolve into a criminal is fascinating. Gerard Depardieu is also excellent. There is some brutal violence which is to be expected considering the subject but I recommend this to all film fans.
5,works great,"Not much to say about this, they are regular cables to extend existing cables. The connectors seem high quality for being assembled by trained pigmy's off the coast of southern Wales."
3,...yeah?,"I made this purchase due to the fact that the RCA Male to Mini Jack (male) restricted the distance that my computer could be placed away from the subwoofer of our home theater. I'm pretty sure that in adding on this extension, I've lost some of the sound quality. Reason why I speculate that is due to the fact that I now have to turn up the volume 75+% to get decent sound coming through the speakers with the addition, whereas before it was loud at 50%. That's just an observation that I've made.If you need it, you need it. If you can manage without it, you manage without it. I'm a little indifferent about this product because it does what I needed it to do, just not at the capacity that I was expecting. That's why I've rated it at only 3-stars."
2,Flimsy terminal ends,While these work fine the terminal ends feel like they could slide off if a truck rumbled by.I also wish there was a size between 25' and 50'.
4,"Useful, but questionable quality","I'm mostly satisfied. However, I should have been tipped off that these aren't -that- great, since there's no plating (adding to cost, without doing anything useful). These function fine, except the connections are a little loose, and don't always carry all the sound. Occasionally, they're quite finicky, and I have to twist and prop them just right, to get good sound out of them. Most of the time, and when I have them tweaked just right, the sound is good. Otherwise, I get some of the music and a lot of static. Possibly, that's just my amp making up and mixing the channels a little."
4,"Great Thematic Score, very ambient","Carter Burwell's Corruptor score is very ambient in nature, and uses a lot of Asian-inspired sounds and instruments. The theme track presented in track 1 is carried throughout the album with elements that appear in crucial scenes. With respect to a great composer, the score has some great moments, however, some scenes have redundant sounds which are much more ambient in nature than thematic...an example of this are the percussion in some tracks which are nonstopping. This truly is a score to a movie and is particularly enjoyable to a fan of the film itself.I recommend seeing the film and then, if you are impressed, buy this album.BTW: The song ""baby I'm so lonely..."" in the movie, which many people keep asking about is by Alex To."
3,It's ok looks good,Well I've had one similar to this one before this was hard because the picture doesn't show the shot gun shells but it is a good product my hunting buddy wants one I buy other Allen company products and haven't had any problems there a good company
3,just didnt fit,I got this for my mossberg 835 came quick and was of good quality but they was no way this was gonna fit that gun or any shot gun for that matter i think maybe the seller listed it wrong got one else where at about the same price
5,Wonderful,"I haven't much to add that others haven't touched on, so I will just add my voice in saying that Ms. Szporluk's poetry is simply beautiful. These are poems meant to be read over and over. I love her style--different than a lot of poets I've read, and it works well. This truly is a book worth owning."
4,Larissa Szporluk's Dark Sky Question,"If one wants to visit a world not of our own, not that of heaven, but some alternative universe, this is the book to guide your journey. Through Szporluk's underlying theme of questioning religion, she is able to create this world. Decisive wording allows the reader to elevate to her unique vision ."
2,Martial arts guide for parents,"I bought this book as part of a bullying package that my son's karate school was pushing. I found that the book describes what parents should look for in a karate school. It is against flashy uniforms and young instructors and for retired teachers teaching peace in tattered belts. Where do I find such a teacher? My son's teacher is young and in good shape. While the book makes some good points, I found this book to be a bit self serving as it recommends the author's school and his affiliates as the only people who teach martial arts correctly. I signed my son up for self defense against bullies. What this book teaches is running away, agreeing to be humiliated, and lying to boot. I want my son to stand up with confidence and use martial arts if necessary.Instead, the book advocates a quaker like approach. Please!!!! I'm in the process of finding a martial arts school that teaches self defense not self humiliation"
3,Meals in a minute,"The book came in a timely manner. It was in very good condition. Most of the things in it were in some of my other cookbooks, but it did give me some insight on heart healthy meals. I don't know how much I will be using it, but it is good to have around if I run into problems. The reason I purchased the book is because my husband had a heart attack and was told to go on a heart healthy diet and didn't give me any resourses to go by."
5,"All good, all healthy, new ideas","I have cooked a number of recipes from this cookbook. All have been very simple to make and all have been good to eat. Nothing too spectacular yet, but all good, hearty, filling meals. Light, healthy, easy to make and good to eat, you can't ask for more from a cookbook."
3,A decent book for your collection,"I own and use several ""fast and healthy"" cookbooks, and this one falls into the more mediocre section of my collection. The meals are indeed quick and healthy, but there are quite a few fishy ones (which don't go over well in my house) and ones that we simply wouldn't eat. This may be just my family's taste, though, so I can see why it would be great in other households.I have found enough recipes in here to make it worth my purchase, but it's not my favorite book."
2,A waste of money,Healthy heart recipes shouldn't include fatty meats like lamb and pork or other cholesterol laden foods. I've done better on my own diet.I'm giving the book back to my physician who recommended I buy it.
4,Screaming for A Wilhelm Scream!!,"The album starts off with the harsh, Strung Out-like vocals, followed by that sweet, crunch punk guitar riffage....beautiful, simply beautiful. One downfall could be the amount of f-words throughout the album, but yet some of it fits into humerous nature. All in all, they're up there with Strung Out...GREAT, CLASSIC PUNK ROCK!!! GRAB IT NOW!"
1,its not wat u think,"my ma get this for me cuz she thot i wood like it but it has to many swares. im realy not sopost to have music with swares like this got. i like this band ""taking back sunday"" and ""underoath"" and my ma read that i wood like this to but i dont. if u like music like ""taking back sunday"" u wont like this- trost me i know wen a band is bad and this band is totale bad. wen i first got it i put it in the cd player of my grampas truck and boy did he get mad! he thot it was quiet a sin to lissen to that kind of""garbage"" he even told my ma he dint think a kid of my age shuld (i am 9) have it in a CHRISTIAN howse . so just trost me if ur a CHRISTIAN and u want to lissen to a good band u shuld get ""taking back sunday"" or ""underoath"" but dont get this sware fulled cd."
3,"PV300 is decent; PV300 Eagle ""Elite"" is top notch","I originally purchased the PV300 borescope. The PV300 is a BASE MODEL borescope. The picture of the base model PV300 on Amazon is not accurate. The PV300 did not meet my needs when used in a rugged application...so I returned it and started looking for something else. After a little searching I found the PV300 Eagle ""Elite"" online for just a few more dollars ($20-$25 more)from an Amazon vendor: toolwarehouse.com. I'm much more satisfied with the PV300 Eagle ""Elite"" then the base model PV300. The smaller, foam filled storage case, the more flexible braided stainless steel shaft, the protective foam boot, and most important of all its clearer optic qualities and a brighter light source make for a top notch piece of equipment. The PV300 Eagle ""Elite"" is recommended for anyone that needs a high quality, low cost borescope...but if you can settle for second best then maybe the base model PV300 will work for you."
3,2002 Cup Review,Great football clips to watch but unfortunately the DVD quality ip poor ...It tends to get stuck halfway and completely stops.
2,Poor Quality,"I must agree with other reviews that the quality of this DVD is poor and the content is great, and disagree with the comments on the the ""Excellent"" Quality.A wonderful tournament with lots of great goals. It was only three years ago but the footage has somehow been degraded from a high quality digitally broadcast program into a rough analog DVD. It looks OK on our small 17"" screen but on our 52"" I can no stand to watch.It would have been easier to overlook had this DVD not cost $30!"
4,Good highlights,"The highlights are great. It leaves you wanting to see more of the game, but with 64 games covered they can only show so much. The video quality is a little less than what you would see in an NFL DVD. I'm sure it probably just has to do with the source material they are working with.It's a great video for those with only a casual interest in soccer because it is non-stop goals."
5,Excellent Product,"I thoroughly enjoyed this product. The picture quality and photography are excellent, the narration is very good, and the mechanics are great. This product is much better than the World Cup Vol 4 1990-1998, which I also purchased."
2,great sound but tepid music,"the sound quality of this cd is really good and there is lots of space and detail in the recording. None-the-less, I find the music a bit boring and more suited to back-ground listening than real serious listening. I may end up giving this one away. What a shame as the recording quality is so good."
3,games is great except for a few things,This game was good except for the fact you couldn't get out of quick race.
3,Game,I got this for somebody.... so i dont know nothing bout it..... but im guessing is great cause i aint got no complaints... so obviously the person loves this game.... thanks
5,It&#65533;s simply the best!,"I'm a big fan of Formula 1 games, and the Grand Prix series is the best out there. And with this addition of the saga, it promises realistic, intense and great-looking ever accomplished."
1,do not buy it,"This was the worst Running game I have ever seen.there is NO information on how to select any controller assignments.Options to leave a practice session would not work,it only returned me to the session.the patch was no help.tech support is worthless.After about 7 hours trying to get it to work I had no more time to waste and broke the cd in half and threw it all in the trash where this game belongs!"
2,Disappointed,"My son had been asking for this for a couple of months, he loves Thomas the train and I have purchased a lot of Thomas items including the trains, the tracks, and the station pieces. For the price of this one I was very disappointed. It is very plain compared to the other station pieces my son has. Even more so than the picture shows. I kept looking in the box for more pieces or stickers or something but there wasn't any. My son however absolutely loved it and the remote control helicopter part. Which was great for the week it worked. It no longer goes up and down only around. My son then stopped playing with it b/c he was very frustrated that he had to keep picking up the helicopter instead of being able to use the remote. So he is very disappointed b/c he wants to play with it and for as much as I paid for this I am very disappointed. I may attempt to contact Target and/or the company that made it to see if I can get it replaced."
1,what a tremendous waste of time and energy!!!!!!,"I ACTUALLY HAD TO GIVE THIS MESS ONE STAR!!! I expected so much more from Omar Tyree! There seems to be no earthly reason for the book to be read. It it boring, tired and a very dull conclusion to ""FLYY GIRL"". I only have a question for Omar Tyree...WHY????"
1,GARBAGE,"This book was pure GARBAGE. I read Flyy Girl just to read this book. I keep asking myself why did I waste my time. Flyy Girl was half-way decent, but For the Love of Money is just plain HORRIBLE. I just could not finish the book. I don't have the energy to write down everything that was wrong with this book, but you can just read some of the other reviews...anyone who's read or attempted to read it knows how bad it is. Oh how I wish I could get my money back! Anyway, do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time or money on this poor excuse for a novel. It's Baaad, very Baaad."
2,Disappointed,"I read Flyy Girl when it first came out. I was expecting a lot more. The entire concept of Tracy meeting Omar Tyree and he writing a book based on her life was terrible. Why couldn't he just tell the story of what became of Tracy? There was a lot missing from the book. The one scene with Victor was terrible. I really could go on and on. There was no substance whatsoever. Being that this was supposed to be the sequel to Flyy Girl I was expecting that same fire. Unfortunately, there wasn't even smoke."
4,Flyy Girl Returns!,"Although For the Love of Money was not as good as Flyy Girl it was still a great book.. This book managed to hold my attention until the end. Omar Tyree's style in this book was very creative and made the book more interesting than if it had been written in the same format as Flyy Girl! I think that the book was good and although Tracy may have never got her man, she still had that same candid, honest and wild personality that she had in Flyy Girl which was one of the man reason I liked that book so much! I recommend it!"
1,For The Love of Money,"I could not get through the first chapter. Very disappointing follow up novel to Flyy Girl, which I enjoyed very much. I found that I was forcing myself to finish when I asked, ""Why waste time on this book when there are so many talented Afro-American writen books I could be enjoying."""
1,Library Book,If you want to read this book big suggesstion. Get it at the library like me and don't put down... dollars for this. It's very boring and Tracy doesn't have a man. No action or Drama either. This is the worst book i've ever read. Omar has really losed his touch for writing. His last two books ... as well. Please write another gooooooood book soon Omar.
3,for the love of money,"I loved Flyy Gyrl so i thoutht the follow-up For The Love Of The Money would also be excellent. I must admit that it did have some alertive parts however the book was no comparison the orginal. It seems as if Tracy lives a fantasy life, everything just goes right for her. If you REALLY have to know what happens to Tracy after teen years than you may want to read it but i recommend that you just ask a friend."
2,Terrible!!!!!,I'm so glad that I got this book from the library that I don't know what to do. I read this book and was wondering what was going on with Omar during this time. The book had entirely to many pages and I never really did get the title. Only this she did in this book was get older and get a job. The stories were crazy and made no sense. Like I said get it from the library. Just wait until someone returns it.
1,A Disappointment,"I've read Single Mom and St. Louis. I always skipped over Flyy Girl. It just seemed as if I would not care for the book. After seeing FTLM, I thought that it would be a good read. I don't like to read sequels to a book that I did not read. Needless to say, I read FG within 1-2 days. Thought that it was interesting. I began reading FTLM. I read the 1st few chapters, found that it was boring and haven't looked at it since.Borrow a copy."
1,BORING,This was the most boring book I've ever read. The poetry was terrible. I know Omar Tyree could have done better than this. Flyy Girl was interesting so I just knew the sequel would be too. Boy was I wrong. Please save your money!
1,Very Disappointed Reader,"I was very anxious to read this book and neglected to read the reviews first before I bought. Needless to say, I agree with the majority of the reviews. This book was horrible. It had absolutly no plot, the poetry inserted after ever chapter was unnecessary. And why did Omar Tyree think it was necessary to make himself a character in the book. Totally unncessary. Tracy didn't grow as a person, like I thought she would. Instead she stayed a spoiled and needy person. I wish that I would have checked this book out at the library, instead of buying it."
1,bad bad bad bad bad,"SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!One of the worst books, i have ever read. I will never ever buy another omar poopre book ever again."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I was in either middle or high school when I read this, and this was the book that everyone was talking about. I found this story to be incredible boring and a very bad follow up to Flyy Girl (even tho I didn't really get with that one).I just can't get with stories like this. I prefer more cleverly written stories than this one. It is an interesting read though. I also read Flyy Girl and feel the same way. I just think these books have a certain predictability to them.You might like it."
1,Horrendous!!!,"I thought this book was horrendous. Fly Girl was a wonderful book, but this one was absolutely ridiculous. I wish I could get my money back. Now it seems like your just writing for the money. What were you thinking? Obviously, you weren't thinking about your work. Maybe you should take a vacation, I think you have a bad case of writers block."
1,Hated It,"I am a fan of Omar but I was very disappointed in this book. It was very hard to read, and the story was very choppy. I really expected more, since Flyy Girl was wonderful."
2,Fly Girl Again,I started this book and I actually began to like what was happening to Tracy.The book began to make sense as well as get good then wouldn't you know it THE END.I believe Omar could have done a better Job I was a little confused as to who was the author also.I know Omar's work and this just did not seem like the work that I was familiar with.Please Omar do yourself and your fans a favor try again call it Fly Girl again and this time give us what we paid for.Don't take your fans for granted.You know we will buy your books because of your history of making great books.Give us something to read and we will always buy your books.
2,2 1/2 Stars Really,"I really liked ""Flyy Girl"" and was looking forward to reading this one. I was convinced that someone else wrote ""Flyy Girl"" because I thought that book's writing style was up to par and ""For the Love of Money"" just was not. This book is nothing for me but inspirational b/c I want to be a screenwriter, but the story is not realistically told. The only parts I was pleased with was hearing about Raheema and Tracy's other friends. Tracy herself was rather self-centered and conceited and made reading the book hard. I read a ""Do Right Man"" and was disappointed by that. I will not be buying any more books by this author."
1,for the love of the money I threw away,"As an African American I am always seeking out African American authors to support. It pains me that Omar Tyree won't be one of them. For the Love of Money was one of the worse books I have read in a long time. It was difficult to read more than a few pages at a time. The characters in the book were unbelievable and without any substance, especially the main character. The poetry was juvenile and did nothing to add to the book's credibility. The main character wrote poetry in five minutes. Needless to say none of them will be winning any literary prizes.Hopefully this author will improve. Somehow I doubt it."
1,Hated it!!!!!!!!,"I LOVED ""Flyy girl"" and I was sooooo happy when I heard about ""For the love of money"". But, boy was I upset at this book!!! I wanted my money back. This book was bad as was ""Sweet St. Louis"" and I was scared to buy ""Just say no!"" because of my last two books by Omar Tyree. This book is nothing like ""Flyy girl"" and the poems in it ...too. This book feels like he just threw it together because everybody wanted a conclusion to Tracy and her life. He could have kept this book though."
1,SOMETIMES A GOOD IDEA SHOULD STAY AN IDEA!,"WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS OMAR THINKING. I RAN OUT TO GET THIS BOOK THE MOMENT I HEARD IT CAME OUT AND THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. I WAS ALWAYS THOUGHT A SEQUEL INCLUDED ALMOST THE SAME CHARACTERS AND THIS BOOK MENTIONED MAYBE 3 OF THE SAME PLUS HER FAMILY IT WAS AWFUL. I REALLY THINK HE SHOULD REWRITE A SEQUEL THIS TIME BEING MORE REALISIC THE WHOLE THING OF HER BEING A MOVIE STAR WAS ROO UNREAL TO BE THE SEQUEL. AND EVEN IN THE END SHE STILL DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY. AT LEAST, IF SHE WASN'T GOING TO BE WITH VICTOR LET HIM HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN THE DUMB BOOK. THE BOOK DID NOT HOLD MY INTEREST AT ALL I WILL NEVER BUY ANY OF HIS BOOKS AGAIN WITHOUT IT BEING A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,Not Impressed,"I'm less than half way through this book and I'd like to stop reading right here, but I'm anxious to see how much worse it gets. This is my first book by Omar Tyree and if this is an indication of his work, it will be my last. I think that as a man trying to write the character of Tracy, he has made her come off as spoiled, self-centered and bitchy. He obviously does not like her. In the real world, none of her ""girlfriends"" would have put up with her. They would have told her off, dropped her, or more likely, both. Thank goodness I did not buy this book but only borrowed it."
1,Disappointed,"The first thing I want anyone whose reading this review to know is that Omar Tyree is an AMAZING writer. However, this is NOT the book to read if you are just forming an opinion of his talent. ""For The Love Of Money"" is not one of his best. I will go as far to say that it is probably THE worst novel by him I've read so far. After reading ""Flyy Girl"" This follow-up was very disappointing. I suggest if you really want to read this story you check it out of the library because you will feel your money was wasted if you buy it."
1,For The Love Of Money,"I was introduced to Omar when I was a freshman at collge. At first I thought it was a little juvenile until I continued to read it. I loved Flyy Girl and had great expections for this book. It's been over three years since I read about Tracy and I was eagerly awaiting to hear about her current lifestyle. My best friend and I were so anxious to buy it the day it came out, but waited until we heard the reviews. Boy was I glad, I rented the book from the library and could barely get the first chapter. Then I listen to it on tape, just to give it another try. I thought listening to it while driving would get me past the first chapter. Tapes later, I still found the book to be boring and could not complete it. I am sorry to say that the story was weak. I understood that Omar wanted to make a mature story geared to an older audience, but his way of going at it was not right."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"After reading Flyy Girl (which I thought was very good), I could not wait to find out what happen to Tracy and the others. I started reading For the Love of Money more than one month ago and I am only on page 88. The writing was so poor that I had to go back a couple of times to be sure of what I had read. I don't usually like to put a book down before finishing it, but I could not even read this book while standing on a long line waiting for service - BORING. The more I read, the more I grew tired of this book. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Save your money!!,"I highly recommend that you borrow this book from someone. It's not worth the money!!! I really wish that I could get my money back from this one. The story flip-flopped too much. It lacked substance and had no real purpose other than to make money because; everyone wants to know what happened to Tracey. A lot of the characters had no real purpose. For one, Tracey's young cousin. What was the point of her being mentioned? Not to mention that he threw himself into to the book as a character. That was just plain dumb to me. It was unrealistic and lacked focus. I have been a follower of Omar's work but this one was a waste of good trees. Fly Girl and Capitol City are definitely my favorites. And in my opinion his best work to date. Next book that he writes, I will check it out from the library."
1,"sorry, omar","did not feel it.i understand that you wanted readers to become reacquainted with tracy and what made her so fly (i'm not spelling it flyy) in the first place. that, i commend you for.what i did not appreciate was the fact that she was still acting like the same spoiled 14 year old that she was in the first book.i know people knocked the first book because of its melodrama, but it was supposed to be marketed towards teens, anyway. (any fool could see that) but the second book, tracy at 28 years old, is a rehash of tracy in 'flyy girl' (before she got afrocentric on me)"
2,I Knew it,"I just had the funny feeling this was going to be a bad novel. It's bad to say but I hate Omar Tyree as a writter. All his books are too dragged out, I only bought this one becase I read Flyy Girl. And once again I was dissapointed, this book could have been so much more."
1,Really Really Bad!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay I usually don't write reviews for books but I had to save somebody from buying this book. First of I loved flyy girl but this book was so boring. First of Tracy goes to holly wood and supposedly comes famous unrealistically fast. It doesn't tell you what happens to any of the other characters of the book like Carmen, Bruce, and Timmy. Rahemma is only mentioned once or twice and tracy is the same selfish spoiled 15 year old only not as interesting. Tracy only see's victor once and they're not together they don't even get any closure. Also Omar throws in lame poetry that isn't deeper than an episode of sesame street and mentions his self too many times. It seems like omar wrote this book while he was high. If you had to find out what happened to tracy get this book from the libray do not waste yo money or yo time."
1,This Book [is bad]!,"I wish I could find Omar Tyree, so I could hit him upside the head with this book and ask him for my money back. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!! It moves so slowly, back and forth every other chapter between the character's life at one point in one chapter, to another point in her life maybe 5 years later in the next chapter. It got confusing and stupid, so I gave up after a few chapters. I just couldn't give this book a chance. It was so bad... that I don't think I'll ever buy another one of Omar Tyree's book again."
2,For the Love of Money,"I was real excited when I heard about a part two of Flyy Girl. But this book was very unrealistic. I mean, how many people do you know would go from being a school teacher to a screenwriter-actress just like that? And Mr. Tyree made Tracy's rise to fame seem so easy. Plus, I saw this novel as an opportunity for Omar Tyree to pump himself up by placing himself in the novel as the writer of Tracy's biography, Flyy Girl. Sorry, Omar, but you really bombed out on this one. And it's funny, I read an interview of his in which he was complaining about how he felt that people didn't take him seriously as a writer or something. This book gives you the reason why."
1,Better luck next time,"Mr. Tyree's latest book just didn't add up for me. I kept on reading because I hoped to find something redeeming or worthy about the characters, but to no avail. Somehow, I just did't see what the point was. Next time, I'll wait for the next book to be released in paperback (and donated to my local library)."
2,Not what I expected(2 and a half stars),"I was so excited when I knew For the Love of Money was going to be a sequel to Flyy Girl. I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This book was missing something. I found that the Tracy in this book had all the money and fame but was lonely and bitter. I mean I was expecting Tracy to at least find a man to share the rest of her life with in this book.(and I do not mean Victor) Another thing that bothered me was that Tracy went from teacher to big Hollywood star with no bumps in between. Omar also should not have mentioned himself in the book so much either. The poetry could have been excluded also. There was a part in the book where Jill Scott is mentioned but Tracy says that you know what to expect from her. Was that a dis to Jill Scott??? Anyway, St.Louis was horrible but please get A Do Right Man. I still have faith in you Omar."
3,Excellent,This was the second book by Omar Tyree that I read. The fact that others didn't like the book was their opinion but in my opinion this book was a page turner. I really enjoyed reading it.
5,"""Loved It""","Tracey Ellison Grant is back!!! She has grown from the spoiled little girl that she was when we left her. She is someone who is around my age going after what she wants . And unlike a lot of books out there her primary focus is not a man. The poetry added even more appeal to the book. And for those of you who hated to hear ""Flyy Girl"" the movie mentioned so much please try to remember that Omar Tyree has not yet gained the following of someone like E.Lynn Harris ,if you don't toot you own horn who will. This is a must read."
2,Could not finish it.,"I loved Fly Girl, so when I seen that a new book came out called For The Love of Money based on the same characters only grown up I was thrilled to read it. But once I did, I could not get past several pages, I honestly don't like it. I own the book and never even read it through."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are dying to read this book, I suggest you go to the library. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY... This book is long and drawn out. It keeps you waiting for something good to happen, but it never does. Usally if I'm interested in book it takes about 3 to 4 days to read it, but this book took me 6 long miserable months. I had more fun pulling out my wisdom tooth, than reading this piece of crap. I don't want to give away any details, but Mr. Tyree shouldn't have made a sequel to a fantastic book like Flyy girl."
2,NNNNooooooooooo,I did not like for the Love of Money because for me it went too slow. She calmed down too much in this story. I loved Flyy Girl. But this was not working for me. She was not wild. She was just too boring. I would suggest reading this book is there is nothing else to read. But don't spend your money on it.
1,A very big disappointment,"I love Omar Tyree, and although I am a loyal fan, this book disappointed me more than a little bit. I dont think that Omar Tyree gave the Flyy Girl fans what they were looking for with this sequel. He should have never written a sequel, and my advice for anyone who is considering reading this book, DONT!!! It was a waste of time, and I was highly upset with the way that things turened out for Tracy and her first love, Victor Hinson. Im sure that a lot of Flyy Girl fans want to find out what ever happened with Tracy and Victor as wll as I did, and I wont tell the story, but I will say that Omar Tyree cheated fans on the whole Tracy and Victor ordeal, and I was so disappointed, that I regretted ever checking this book out from the library. The book was also hard to get into, boring, and all in all For The Love of Money was irrelavent to Flyy Girl."
2,FOR THE LOVE OF WHAT?,"VERY BOOOORING,SILLY,FAKELIKE AND AFTER READING THE COLDEST WINTER EVER I REALLY BECAME FRUSTRATED BY THIS BOOK! HOPEFULLY FLYY GIRL WILL BE A MUCH BETTER BOOK-WE WILL SOON SEE."
2,A DISAPPOINTING BOOK,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK. I DID NOT KNOW IF I WAS IN THE PRESENT OF THE PAST. I DID NOT LIKE THE STORYLINE. I DID NOT FINISH READING THIS BOOK. THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS, I KIND OF JUST SCAN THE PAPERS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE BOOK ENDED. I'M SORRY OMAR BUT THIS WAS NOT THE BOOK."
2,LOL,"I admit this book is not up to Flyy Girl Standards,but it isnt all that bad. Now Boss Lady, thats trash!"
1,Not worth the money.,"I bought it thinking that it was gonna be good. Flyy Girl was off the hook and I was so sure that the sequel was gonna be even better. I was wrong. If you want to read it for yourself, borrow it from a friend. The book had no point, no climax and no ending. Omar could've put that story in a magazine and saved me some money."
1,STOP THE MADDNESS,"I read FLyy Girl, which was a pretty decent book.So when the sequal was being released, I had to get it. This book was horrible. Tracy is boring and wack. As for Omar Tyree, I am a unoffical fan of his. I sent him a email talking about my desire to be a writter. He sent me a nasty email that I surely did not appreciate he is cocky and for no reason because every review I've seen is negative. He could of done better. Oh and his latest book, Just Say No. is stupid too!"
1,Pretty dull and boring,"I had heard that Omar was a decent writer, but I am so glad I got this book from the library instead of spending money on it! The storyline was poorly developed, the main character's life was completely unrealistic, and the dialogue -- almost laughable in some places (where it really wasn't supposed to be funny). I think Omar should have experienced living in Hollywood before he wrote this book; I'm sure the black actresses who really are trying to make it there would like to believe it's as easy as it was for Tracy. Also, did Will Smith have an investment in this novel? He must have, with all the references to his Philly roots. Bottom line: you have to care about a character to want to read the book. Tracy was so shallow and egocentric that I didn't even care how it ended."
1,Leave Well Enough Alone,I had a very hard time reading this sequel to Flyy Girl. When I finished reading Flyy Girl. I closed the book laughing and crying at the same time. By the time I finished the novel I felt as if I grew up with Tracy and her friends and family. There were lessons taught in the book. For The Love Of Money did NOTHING for me. I found myself putting down the book every few pages. I had NO emotional connection with any of the characters. I even found it hard to remember some names. This sequel was very empty. So much more could have been done with Tracy's evolvement into womanhood. Omar should have just either thought about it more. Or simply left well enough alone. (The repeated reference to himself in the novel was at an annoying level all by itself.)
2,I was disappointed...,"This book was suppose to be the sequel to Flyy Girl. I was really looking forward to reading a good book, but For The Love Of Money was truly a BIG disappointment. Giving this novel two stars is probably over rating it! REALLY! I read this book in spurs. It took almost a month to finish it......B-O-R-I-N-G!"
1,Disappointed,"I read Flyy Girl, and I was so impressed. It reminded me of my younger days (not as promiscuous though). I couldn't put the book down. So when I saw ""For the Love of Money"" a sequel to Flyy Girl, I was excited. After reading the first couple of pages, I knew it was going to be a snoozer. Next time he should stick with what he knows, and obviously he does not know how to write a sequel."
1,For the Love of Money? More Like Waste of Money,"I bought this book knowing it was going to be as good as Flyy Girl, but I was wrong. It's so BORING! I'm trying to keep reading it thinking it will get better, but so far NO LUCK. I regret buying it and I wish I would've listened to the previous readers. Take it from me: Don't buy this book! You will be bored to death UGH"
3,Jbrown,"I thought this book was ok. The first one although had me drawn in.But Tracy is doing her thang! I give hands up to a determined, strong-minded black woman."
1,one of the worst books i ever read,My friend purchased this book for me because I love Flyy Girl so much. I tried to read it but it just sucks. I would not recommend this book to anybody
1,0 stars,"My mother bought me this book when I was in high school, and I didnt get past page 20....tried to read it again(5 years later) and realized, this book is plain terrible!!! Please do not waste your money. I wouldn't be able to finish this book if somebody paid me...(I'm soo serious)"
1,All I Could Say is...HORRIBLE!!!,"After reading Flyy Girl which was an excellant book i would think this would be a great continuation....WRONG!! This book was so horrible and bland that i stopped reading dead in the middle of the book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and Omar Tyree had the nerve to add a third book, Boss Lady. I'm not either gonna bother and neither should anyone else who doesn't want to waste their money."
1,Sequels are always worse,this book is a complete disappointment. The first was a coming of age tale that even hit close to home with someone as young as me. I hated the Omar Tyree references and the boring life of Tracy. He should of left the uncompleted life of Tracy alone. My imagination would of came up with a better ending.
2,Dissappointing,"I purchased this book with such high hopes only to be dissapponted. I've read two other book by Omar Tyree, ""Flyy Girl""( which I loved) and ""Sweet St Louis"" (that I also enjoyed.) But to my dismay this was such a let down. This book didn't seemed to have a focus or plot. It just flowed from one uninteresting chapter to another. Tracy, the focus of both ""Flyy Girl"" and ""For the Love of Money,"" charactor was well developed on a personnal level in the book but other than her thoughts there wasn't anything else to hold your attention other than the hope that you just haven't got to the good part yet. But by page 200 I finally realized there wasn't a good part."
1,Terrible,I never wrote a review on this book because I thought it was obvious. But this book was horrible. Fly Girl was good but this book sucked. Don't waste your time taking this out of library.This book was a waste of trees. For Real......
1,Mad About It,"I'm Glad I bought this in paper back. I read Flyy Girl and had very high hopes. I purchased this book like 6 months ago and still haven't finished it. And I probably won't. I mean [dang], This [stinks]! Whatever happened to Bruce??? And the way Tracy met up with Victor was terrible and she looked like the same [girl] she was in Flyy Girl. Why is she still making the same bad decisions she made at 16? I mean gosh, it's supposed to be a sequel. And the Hollywood thing was freakin far fetched...We're just supposed to believe that Tracy became a millionaire? Either Omar Tyree is stupid as hell or he expects us to be. The only characted I appreciated in this novel was Rashida (sp). She was the only one who made real growth. All of our other characters were left behind, and Tracy was still as shallow as she was when she was 16. They should have a negative rating because 1 star is far too much."
1,worst book by Omar Tyree,"I rate this book no stars , it was the worst book that I've brought in a long time. I had the nerve to purchase a hard cover based on the authors name alone assuming that the book would be off the hook being it was a sequel of flyy Girl and that was very good , my advise to the author is to refund everyones money that that purchased this book including myself. next time I will go on line and read up on the book before it's purchased."
1,Changing a Previous Review,"I originally reviewed this book in December of 2000... I got the opportunity to read over that review today and realized that I completely lied! This was probably one of the worst books I have ever read in the genre of African American books.. This book was beyond boring and had too much of an unrealistic plot... Tracy had yet to grow up and was still acting as an immature, selfish brat! I wouldn't waste my time, energy or money buying this book (and to think I bought the book when it was hardback!) And while we are on the topic of Tracy, Flyy Girl is a book that will seem good to you as a young teenager, and I guess the plot of the book is okay but as an older teen/adult you will too realize this book was horribly written. ...I apologize for my previous review and anyone I may have caused to buy that terrible book! I chalk that up to being young and dumb..."
2,A HIGHLY ANTICIPATED DISAPPOINTMENT,"I really expected a lot more. The only thing this book did was tell us what happened to Tracy. I felt like Omar was building us up for the big climax all the way through the book, but we never got there. The book contained no twists, turns or bumps in the road. If you haven't read Fly Girl, you will even more disappointed."
3,unique,"I liked FG because it was different reading a story from the point of view of a young girl and a young girl's thoughts. I liked FTLM because of the unique way Omar Tyree wrote this story. The insertion of the poetry and making Tracy Ellison Grant a real person was different. I found Single Mom, A Do Right Man and Sweet St. Louis to be slow reads but I quickly read through both the books re: Tracy."
5,GREAT BOOK,I read several of the other reviews and I would like to say that people don't always like change and I feel that some of them were to critical!! This is a great book and it was well writen. It gave me good insight into Hollywood and getting into the business of film making. I think all of these critics need to go and write there own book and see how well it does. I think not enought people tried to relate to the book
2,it wasn't THAT bad,"you all act like omar tyree basically unecessarily killed some trees to make this novel. granted, the whole reference to omar tyree in every twenty pages was a waste, as was that smooth ride she had up to to the a-list of hollywood. but all and all, i was satisfied that she didn't end up with victor, because it was just not meant to be and to do so would be really contrived. my reason for reading the sequel was to find out what happened to (raheema, mercedes, victor, tracy's family, even kiwana), and i got my answer, which was what i felt was what was most successful with the novel. Whoever expected this to be a ralph ellison masterpiece, well that was you own faults for setting yourself up for a disappointment."
2,Omar killed it...,"If you want Tracy & Victor to live happily ever after don't read this book! Not only do they not get back together but what happened between them made it even worse! Omar how could you???!!! I almost wanted to cry as hard as Tracy! But Victor does bring up some valid points about why their love wasn't meant to be.I agree with alot of the reviews that this book is very hard hard to follow and get into to. I read Flyy Girl in 2 days & it's taking me forever to try to get through FTLOM. I had already read the reviews on here but I still decided to get it anyway because I wanted updates on Victor, Raheema, Mercedes & her family (where is Carmen, Bruce, Timmy, Cash & Jantel??).Pick this one up from the library if you can."
2,Why Did you do it to your self? Why?,"Have you ever heard the saying that when something is good, leave it alone? Well Mr. Omar R. Tyree did the exact oppisite, ""Flyy Girl"" a perfectly good book, and he destroyed it, completly missed it up. Sometimes things don't need a sequel just leave it alone, yet he did it anyway, Tracy growing up is not what people wanted to read about, especially when she lived a life of 30 grown women when she was younger in ""Flyy Girl"" so what more could she have possibly experienced."
2,Disappointed,I have to say that the sequal to Flyy Girl left me feeling dissapointed. FTLoM seemed to go way too slow for me. In all of the chapters that take place in 2000 you already know that she is a sucess where as in the 1996 chapters she still hasn't gotten her success yet. It just seems to take too long to get the points of the story.
1,time wasted,"IT WAS TERRIBLE, THE WORST PART WAS THE POETRY!!!! THEY HAD NO FEELING, NO COLOR, NO NO NO"
2,Unexpected,This book did not live up to the expectations of Flyy Girl. My biggest problem was the alternating between one chapter in 1996 and the next chapter set in 2000 was a bit nerve wrecking. Then the author kept mentioning HIS name over too many times. Very dissappointed.
1,For The Love Of Garbage,"Normally I do not write reviews, but in this case I have to agree with the ones I have read. Flyy girl was off the chain. For the Love of Money - not so good. If you feel you must read this book then borrow it from a friend. When you finish, you'll be ready to pay them to take it back. For those of you are curious about this book because of the reviews -- don't be. Re-read Flyy Girl. You aren't missing anything. As one reviewer said, the best parts of the books are the updates on Tracy's friends. I'm not sure what Omar Tyree was thinking."
2,Disappointment,"I was first introduced to Omar Tyree with his novel ""Leslie"" and I absolutely loved it! I then decided to check out other novels he had written. I read ""Flyy Girl"" first which, I liked as well and followed it with ""For The Love of Money"", which was a Big Disappointment! They always say sequels are bad and this novel proved that theory. The novel starts off with the end of the story and in the middle of the novel right when it is going to climax you realize the connection between the beginning and the end and loose interest because you already know the ending of the novel. The novel did not keep my interest and seemed rather long. This novel could have been summed up in one chapter and used for the Prologue to ""Boss Lady"". After reading ""For The Love of Money"", I am not interested in reading the sequel ""Boss Lady"" at all! Why make a sequel to something that is so bad?"
1,$14 DOWN THE DRAIN,"Well, the so called ""SEQUAL"" to Flyy Girl was the worst book that I have ever read. Flyy Girl wasn't that great of a book either, but I thought with ""For the Love of Money"" something good might come out of it. NO. This book is slow, boring, and just not interesting. I have to say I kept on reading thinking something good would come out of it. NOTHING. I will never read an Omar Tyree novel again. VERY DISAPOINTING."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"I really hated this book. Flyy girl was one of the best books i ever read. This book was how do i say it TRASH. I thought i did nothing but waist my time and money on this book. When i heard for the love of money flyy girl returns i was thinking oh another great book that i can refer my girls to but ant wrong THIS BOOKS SUCKS.the best part was the first chap. maybe 1st 2-3 pages when she was saying what was going on with every one, but after that it all goes down hill. :( i just wish i would have came here and read some reviews before i bought it."
3,it was ok but not betta than flyy girl,this book was very good. it didn't have that spice or sexual style that it had in flyy girl. it was still good though cause the book showed how she grew out of her wreckless teen years and into an smart intelligent and sucessful woman. the other great thing about this book is that in flyy girl she was stuck on victor hinson and she waited on his sorry a** through college then for him to go out and get married then become muslim right after he got out of jail and not think once about tracy was bogus. but she got through that phase cause to me he was the only thing that was still linking her to the past but she showed him. so this book was great and i rated it a 4 cause it wasn't quite as eventful as flyy girl but it was still off da hook!!!!
1,UNSATISFACTORY,"BASICALLY I AGREE WITH ALL THE OTHER POOR REVIEW'S, AUTHOR MENTIONED HIMSELF TOO MUCH, TRACY WAS A SELF CENTERED AWFUL EXCUSE OF A BLACK WOMEN, I CONTINUED TO READ THE BOOK HOPING FOR A SUPRIZE ENDING, OR ANYTHING, I'LL GO BACK TO READING TONI MORRISON , HOWEVER FLYY GIRL WASN'T BAD, THOUGH TRACY'S BIG HEAD WAS ANNOYING"
4,Gold Soundz single review,This cd is fairly good. I prefer Gold Soundz and Exit theory to the rest of the tracks. The instrumental is funky. It's hard to hear what he says in Strings of Nashville. 9minutes and 20 seconds on the cd. I bought it just because of Gold Soundz.
2,to small,"It wasnt what I expected at all, it had hardly any cakes Ideas. It was kinda like fast food pictures you never get what it looks like yoru going to."
5,Childrens cakes,Really cute ideas in this book for kids. My grandchildren will enjoy these cakes for years to come. Ideas are simple and come out great.
5,MOVING FILM EXTOLING FREEDOM...,"although some people may find the music somewhat ""cheesy"" this film is a wonderful portrayal of the fall of the berlin wall. it is very moving to see the east german people streaming across the opening borders so elated to feel free. the west germans were also welcoming and happy as well. in this day in age i believe our younger generation needs to see this film! it is a reminder of a time and a place where freedom and oppression lived side by side and the devasting effects of oppression and the wonderful feeling of freedom can be closely compared."
4,Great resource,"This is one of those books that can sit on your shelf for months or a year without any use. Then, all of the sudden, it becomes an invaluable resource. As a veteran of two Broadway shows, one of which is in the book, I have used the book to quickly get up to speed on a show. If you are looking for an in-depth analysis and documentary of the productions, this is not the book for you. If you want to get a quick glimpse at the plot and where the characters and songs fit into it--then this book is one that your should own."
4,"Loved the book, but hated the ending!",Freeze Tag was a real page turner. I read it in one day! It kept me guessing what was going to happen next. Cooney writes some of the best books ever but this books ending sucked. You can do a little better. Please listen to us Cooney and write a sequel!!!
4,Unsettling....,"I loved the cover for this book, it was one of those covers that just grab you. Anyway, I really liked the sense of unease that Caroline B Cooney set up through the book. Lannie's presence whenever she was around scared me, and I have to admit I was pretty annoyed at the ending. But, I understand the message that Cooney is sending, I just didn't like Lannie."
3,Oh my Goodness!..,"Gosh, Caroline B Cooney comes up with some very unusual stories!Here is no exception...A cold young girl goes around freezing people by pointing at them.Yeah, it held my interest...but there are better Horror novels."
1,Ugh,"Finishing this book was like pulling teeth. Most of Cooney's books are very good, but this one was extremely boring. It's hard to feel sorry for the herione, Meghan, and even the climax of the book doesn't pick up the pace. Not only do you not care what happens to the villian of sorts, Lannie, you couldn't care less if they all dropped dead. I found myself wondering why they didn't just get it over with. Don't judge all Cooney books by this one. The Face on the Milk Carton is probably her best."
3,freeze tag a little Cold,"Lannie, Megan, West, Tuesday, and Brown have lived in the same neighborhood and played together for their whole lives. As children, freeze tag was their game of choice. Only, when Lannie was IT, she could really freeze someone when she tagged them. Turn them into a block of ice. Now, as teenagers, Megan and West are in love. They all have vague memories of not liking playing with Lannie as kids, but they don't know why. Lannie, now a cold, unloved teenager, reminds them.....with a touch. She is determined to claim West for her own. No one is safe from the Ice Queen. Can Megan escape Lannie with her life or will she and her friends end up frozen............ forever?"
3,Ok.... just doesn't seem like Cooney's work.....,"Freeze Tag was a good, book, I guess. I liked the way it had a great beginning, starting with Lannie freezing people, but this book was just plain... weird! I mean, come on, how on earth did Lannie get her powers to FREEZE people, especially, like, their HEARTS?? I hated it when West was frozen, and it was all Lannie's fault! Most people are disappointed in the ending, and I must say, so am I, but for a different reason. I LIKED it when Meghan saved Lannie from the car, but, still, why was it so unsetteling??? It needed more details, more clues, and.... to sound more like Cooney, because her books are all so great... this book was just... uh, weird. That's all I can say..."
2,No more than an illustrated checklist !,This book looks like an illustrated checklist : 10 birds by plates and very small description ! No pointers on plates to see the difference between 2 species ! In the Index there are birds not describe and illustrated ... ghost birds ! No alternative names and very strange taxonomy for some birds ! We are now in 2008 and this book isn't updated : many bird species missing !
3,"Cute book, but...","I really want to love this book, but the premise is all wrong. Feet really are made for kicking, and hence, they are a great teaching tool. When intractable people don't do what they are told, I bury my boot so far up their anuses that my bootless foot comes out brandishing a brown sock. It's not very diplomatic, but it teaches them to listen.I'm only kidding. Nice book."
4,Fweet are not for kicking,"I found this book at a library originaly. My 3-yr old granddaughter loved it, so I ordered a copy for her to keep. Arrived quickly,and in terrific shape."
5,A Great Book For Preschoolers,"I am a foster parent and these little ones tend to be somewhat violent when they have a tantrum or just get mad. These books help you learn a specific language to address their behavioral issues. The key words in these books ('feet are not for kicking people) give the children a key to addressing their own behavioral issues. I can't tell you how many times one of these kiddo's will start to kick something and then say, 'feet are not for kicking.'"
3,Didn't work for my 2 year old,"These books don't keep my son's interest, so he doesn't listen to them. I bought the whole series...teeth are not for biting, etc. They may work great for some people, but not so great for me. He's two now and I don't seem to have problems in these areas currently, so I haven't tried to read them recently...actually I should start using the ""hands are not for hitting"" now that I think of it."
1,Utter garbage,"This book is utter nonsense. An ""Internet tax""? Uh huh. And MSN Hotmail is about to shut down, too. Just forward this e-mail to 10 people and you can prevent losing your e-mail account.It's about time that the United States started obeying international law, rather than coming up with random books that pretend this is a ""subversion"" of its freedoms"
5,This is scary stuff.,"I grew up like a lot of people thinking the UN was, if not the saving grace of the world, at least benign. But from this book it's clear that's just not the case. What was particularly eye-opening for me were the chapters on the US courts, and on how the UN and unelected non-governmental organizations are trying to destroy this country's ability to control its own destiny by way of legislation - as opposed to letting voters decide. We can certainly see evidence of that all around the country, where courts are making decisions that voters would never approve - they're making them BECAUSE the voters wouldn't approve. But I didn't realize that the UN, which supports so many of these NGOs and other such organizations financially, was a major player in trying to destroy our freedoms. I'd recommend this book to anybody who is disgusted by the overwhelmingly liberal cast of the courts in the country, and wants to figure out how they got that way. Scary and important."
1,Right Wing Rubbish,"I read the whole book and found it somewhat beyond pathetic. It must be quite rare to not find a single part that made any sense or that one could agree with. This is shear right wing nationalistic rubbish on a massive scale and the sort of nasty rhetoric that makes the US so disliked in the rest of the world, including most western nations. This gentleman should definitely move to Idaho and set up a commune of some sort. A sad but true reflection of what America is becoming at the moment as it goes through another of it's strange phases."
4,"It's NICE, but........","I am very upset that Corky Buzsek's huge #1 hit in Kazhakstan, ""Bing Bang, Bing Bang Bong"" was no include in this CD. If they include, I'm rate it not just 5 stars, but High 5 stars!!!"
1,Cannot pull songs off it for your own mixes,"I bought this CD for one song, Born To Be Wild, the rest of the CD is just OK. So even though you own it, the stupid disc won't play in the computer and I cannot pull off the only song I wanted for my music mixes. Thank-you you greedy record producers yet once more!"
4,unexpected dimonds,"Hi,I got tired of pop music (White and Black) a long time ago. Every few years something interesting happens but overall - quiet times awaiting something New and interesting. BTW, importantly - I live in the USA.So, I resort to listening to what they often call - world music. Anything from Ivan Kupala, to French/Arab rappers, to Gogol Bordello, to Andean and Native N. American music . . . So when I heard BORAT's soundtrack I was blown away! There are scenes from the movie (or is it ""motion-cinema""?), a few tracks that seem to be jokes (Born To Be Wild+) and that's all funny and good. But many of the tracks of my interest are musical gems! Wonderfully fresh (for us in the US) rhythms of South-Central Europe with lots of Gypsy sound - boundless energy and beat fused with melancholy [Chaje Shukarije, Gypsy Kolo, Siki, Siki Baba++]. If you can move past ""Borat"", you'll be treated to the world that's very unique, fresh, and fun for us here in the US.K"
2,I will not be using this product,"Great seller and shipping time but horrible product. It is baggy fitting on a remington 700 stock. It covers up the sling swivel. It has velcro sewn to spandex which is falling apart due to the stiching in it. If I were to use this I would have to do some sewing and cutting in order for it to fit as specified. And as cheap as this product is made it is not even worth it. This is by far the cheapest, thinest material I have ever seen one of these made from. I would never recommend this product."
1,"Piece of ****, Has Velcro to attached it and it definately blocks the sling","DO NOT BUY.... very bad material, very cheap. no wonder its $6. I would never suggest for any one to buy this ."
3,"Video somewhat comical, but helpful nonetheless","This video was made in the 80's and it shows. The format is a lecture by Sarno with questions from a small group of people watching. Okay, the video quality is what you would expect for its time period. But what is comical is the stilted way in which the attendees ask questions - that were clearly written down ahead of time. So that aspect of it feels very staged.But still - to hear Sarno explain it in a lecture form was helpful for me, and I am very grateful for his work. I have recently begun a more updated and comprehensive program by Dr. Schubiner, which is fantastic. Go to unlearnyourpain.com/ to signup. Additionally, there are links on the site of free lectures (on other sites) given by Schubiner.So you can watch this Sarno video. And there others available now that are more current that I recommend.CheersBill"
5,You must have this book,"I read this book within a week after my wife left me, and it helped me tremendously. Donald Harvey maybe oversimplifies things, but when you are going through the crisis, you want to know why this is happening and what to do. Not all of the ""why"" questions will ever be answered, but this book helped me make some sense of what was going on, why a spouse leaves and what to do and how to do it. Most of the time if someone leaves a marriage it is the husband and just to make it easier to read he refers to the spouse that has left as ""he"" or the ""husband"".I am afraid that I must disagree with the Rev. Dr. Daniel J.G.G. Block's review of the book. I'm a pastor and I reccomend it to every pastor I know to have for a reference and to give to someone who is facing this crisis. You will never know what it is like unless you've been through it. I've been through it and this book helped me very much."
4,"An excellent, practical treatment to surviving an affair","An excellent, practical treatment to surviving an affair or marital breakup. Written from the counselors point of view, Prof Harvey tells steps to helping each partner deal with one of them having an affair and wanting to leave. He establishes practical boundries and expectations for re-connecting. A very good treatment."
2,not what I expected,"The tone of the book is pretty defeatest from the outset. While there are quotations from the Bible, I found myself wondering if this was really a guide for committed Christians. The author seems to say that in relationships that aren't working, divorce is inevitable, not taking into account the sovereignty of God. If you are interested in saving your marriage, I would suggest Ed Wheat's ""Love Life For Every Married Couple."" It is firmly routed in Biblical teachings and has a section on how to save your marriage alone."
1,"This is a garbage book, novice will be confused","The authors do not know how to write a tutorial for new Struts 2 users. If you are very new to Struts, this book will confuse you and tell you nothing valuable.The authors may be experts of Struts, however, they do not know how to guide a novice to learn struts from beginning. They omitted so much content which is very necessary to beginners. If you know struts very well, you may understand what they are talking about, but why do you want this book if you are already an expert ? Therefore, this book is garbage for anybody."
1,Rookie mistake in chapter 2,"I came across this book in a bookshop and browsed through it.I am surprised to find a glaring mistake in chapter 2 (chapter 1 is only 7 pages long). In the beginning few paragraphs of chapter 2, it briefly described serlvet container and mentioned one of the popular serlvet containers is WebLogic from IBM. WebLogic is not from IBM.I stopped browsing furthur."
3,Fun for what it is!,"This game wasn't really like the table top game at all. It is very simple and I would only get it if you find it dirt cheap, it does have a little bit of charm to it. I had a fun play through and may pop it in from time to time."
1,Noisey printer,This printer is so loud that I woke my sleeping mother up on the other side of the house. Frequent cleaning is needed to keep color pictures looking good. I would pass on buying this one.
3,Sometimes doesn't print,"Sometimes grunts and groans and then prints unintelligible characters- for pages if you don't remove the paper for the out of paper stop. Pressing the off button does't always shut it off. When it prints the output is very good on plain paper, though I don't have another ink jet for comparison. Maybe 2 1/2 stars."
5,"Inexpensive, reliable printer",I have had this printer for about one year. I do a lot of greeting cards and brochures. The colors in all my documents are rich and vibrant. Speed is plenty fast for the average user. I refill my ink cartridges and have had no problem with clogged print heads. A good buy.
5,share it with your girlfriends,This is a lovely movie about women from different generations and their stories. My favorite part is that they come together to make a wedding quilt and that is how we learn most of their life stories.
5,Others' love stories have much wisdom to offer,"This is a great summer romance of sorts with nervous bride-to-be Winona Ryder spending her time writing a master's thesis on a relic American Quilt. As she weaves her paper, she also weaves together the thread of romantic patterns from all the women in her life. There is much to be learned when hearing the life stories of those who have loved before us. It's a simmering multi-layered story of how deep loves, even when lost, never truly leave us. The worst thing in life is to die without your own love story to tell ... even if it didn't end the way you wanted it."
4,Well woven!,"Winona Ryder plays Finn Dodd who spends her summer with her grandmother. There she meets Grandma's sewing friends who start to make a quilt for her wedding day.Each piece of the quilt is symbolic of the many stories they have to tell her. And each story teaches Finn something of love that will eventually help her deal with her own set of problems between the hunky Leon (played by Johnathon Schaech) she met while swimming, and her fiance whom she had a quarrel with.Though somewhat fragmented at times (perhaps intended because of the quilt concept), this tale is rich with poetic imagery and thoughts about life, old age and the beauty of it."
4,How to make an American Quilt,"I got this because Jared Leto is in it. The movie is ok, he is not in it much. It is an ok movie, good to watch if you have never seen it."
5,Great movie!!,A must watch movie for anyone who is a quilter! A great story line and fantastic acting! I have shared the movie with my quilting gals!
3,bought as a gift,I purchased it as a gift for someone for christmas. I didn't view it or examine it. I guess it was okay.
3,Park Hyatt Box Review,"I could only find the Park Hyatt Box CD on Amazon.com first of all,once I received the CD I immediately opened it up and proceeded to listen to the whole thing. I must say it is a very diverse and distinctive accumulation of musical artist with a lot of very very nice easy listening music and songs, old and new. This CD has something for the young generation and the older folks as well. It is truly a melting pot of vast musical talent digitally put together on two disc."
1,Hook DOESN'T work,The metal ring that is suppose to fit around the camera is not practical unless you do not like your neck strap. Do not recommend.
3,"It's a Hand Leash, not a Hand Grip - better for small SLRs","I have a Canon 1D Mark II - and I was buying the Camera Armor for that model (which works great btw) and this strap came with it free! If I had paid for it however, I would be sending it back.The Good: It's made of great quality material and looks nice. It would probably work well with small SLRs or SLRs without battery grips. Especially if there are no other hand grip alternatives.The Bad: The build does not feel very secure with a bigger camera like mine. If you let go of the camera it swings down but is saved at the last second if you don't let the strap slip off your hand. In this way, I would say it is less of a grip, and more of a leash. This is because it only attaches on the top of the camera. Also, the metal key ring scratches the black metal on Canon cameras.Other notes: It is not as big as it looks. It is about 2 quarters wide. And it doesn't seem like it would fit people with bigger hands."
2,Not safe enough,"Compared to wrist straps the SafeGrip wraps around your palm. It doesn't feel safer than without it. It is also harder to use the camera controls with it around my hand.The grip came with a ring missing. Customer support was quick to send out the replacement ring. They said there was a production batch missing the rings. If you can't attach the grip to you SLR, contact Camera Armor.I bought a Canon WS20 Wrist Strap for Camcorders that works perfectly with my Sony Alpha DSLR."
1,Not good for BIG Hands,"If you haoppen to have size 2XL hands, this little puppy is just that too little to be of any use. This is not to say that it's a bad product, it's just too damn small for monster hands.Manufacturers have this idea that they can make a ""one-size-fits-most"" and keep people happy. I suspect this would work 99% of the people. Great, I'm the 1% and don't recommend it."
2,Dumb,Received in a timely fashion as advertised. Unfortunately a stupid product which was a waste of my money. Oh we'll.
1,16 times disappointing,"Sorry, this book is a huge disappointment. Very little is learned about trade entries and trade exits from the 16 interviews conducted for this book. I'm afraid this reeks of marketing. The only entries and exits that this book can describe are apparently the 16 entries and exits the good doctor made coming and going to these trading rooms. This book is simply not for those traders hoping to garner new trade techniques from other professionals. I suggest anyone expecting that to look elsewhere."
1,Disappointing,"I have read Elder's other books and was looking forward to reading this one. Unfortunately, Entries and Exits, does not rise to the standards Elder set with his other books. I can honestly say, ""read his first two books,but,skip this one"" Sorry Dr. Elder."
5,Different streams all leading to one ocean,"Having read a couple trading books before this one, I naturally would have rated this book 3 stars BUT the other 2 starts come from the approach; that is, hearing from other people who are in this business and applying some of the ""rules"" that one almost always reads about.In the book you will find out how people apply these often read rules, if even some rules that they made up as they go along.The important aspect for me was noticing how everyone has one goal, i.e to make money, but- the methods that they each go about it is different and each time the methods seem to have been chosen on the basis of the trader's personality/character.- they traded different market and/or instruments- they used different time frames- they had different risk tolerance- they came from different backgroundsSome commonalities- they seem to love what they do- they persevered when times were rough"
1,don't be fooled by the reviews,"I bought the book because the reviews were good. When I received the book and started to read, I realized I've been duped! It's another one of those trading books with some trade examples and analyses by Elder on those trades. Everything looks perfect after the fact.I personally didn't get much from reading it so I returned it for refund. This is the first book I returned a book to Amazon. At least I now know how to return a book back to Amazon. They paid for the return shipping."
5,Another Winner from Dr. Elder,"Having read his previous two books, my expectations were high. He met and exceeded them with this book. I am on my second reading, this time with a highlighter and notes in the margin. I have found that there are always a few books that end up on everyone's recommended reading list ... the Market Wizard series, Lefevre's book on Livemore, ......, no doubt this one will be added to that list.Well done sir, my compliments."
3,Its Okay,Didnt get a lot out of it. His other 2 books are much better in my opinion. The book just shows several traders and their trading styles. It is a good book for entertainment but it didnt really show much beyond what was already covered in his previous books.
5,an Unbelievably great book!,"Great education from Dr. Elder again! Unlike many other books on trading which are repetitive, every word of Dr. Elder's every book is valuable, not a single wasted. They're all worth their every page, every paragraph and every word.Highly recommended for those who are looking for trading methods.Lucy Chen"
2,Not what I had in mind,"I chose this rating because I really thought this book would open my mind to some new knowledge, but it didn't. Everything in the book the experiences of the various traders, I have learned online. Entries and Exits had nothing to do with learning to enter and when to exit trades but the experiences traders have had in the past. For the money, no I would not recommend this book, sorry."
3,"OK, But Better To Check His Other Books","OK book, easy to read with some interesting points on psychology, but a little expensive for what it is. I love Dr. Elder's work, though. If you don't have it, I would recommend his ""Trading For A Living"", which is far superior, and a must have for any trader."
5,Alleycat,"Felinicity is the ultimate! The other songs are pretty good, too, but there is something special about Felinicity - somewhat a perfect night driving song for my wife and I. I finally found this after YEARS of searching."
4,Felinisity,I heard the tail-end of Felinisity on the Radio as well and was sold! What a great fall-in-love-with-life piano groove. Just an all-out Feel-good Tune!
2,Disappointing,"This is one of the most expensive cookbooks I have (and I also have Millenium). I love cooking and will do whatever it takes to make great dishes. However, when the recipes don't turn out, it's not worth my time or effort. I have found this to be the case with Artful. Two recipes completely did not work, even though I followed the directions exactly.I will try a few more and write an update if I come across some decent recipes, but I can't help but wonder if these were even tested."
2,Good luck - these aren't easy,"Great inspiration in the recipes, but many of them have ingredients you'll have to work hard to find, or have more complicated processes involved (like smoking something) that simply make this book too difficult for the regular home cook. I got it as a gift and started looking through it excited to make some of the dishes, but then when I got to reading the ingredients in detail I started giving up and turning the next one. And then the next one, and the one after that. Halfway through I think I got maybe 2 or 3 things I'd be able to do without spending a fortune just to make one meal. We aren't in the restaurant business, the authors jobs should be to set up a recipe to be made at home. Even in the intro they say that they don't typically even write these things down, but just wing it through inspiration. From this it doesn't surprise me that some people say that some recipes just don't work."
5,very good book,"very good book, good recipes, pretty pictures. i really enjoyed it. i am vegan, lots of good ideas, i highly reccomend this book to all egans"
3,Wrong Description,"For the product itself, it performs well.It is a strong plastic, without being too thick to cut. It fits well into the top, not the deep neck, of Walmart's largest 'traditional' shaped glass vase. Found in the Craft section for $10.I ordered 2 of these from BetterGroHydro without reading the description. Naturally, when I went back, I was dismayed to find that it came in a 25 pack. I got the package, expecting to find 50 there. There was, however, only 2. I can't complain, since I didn't want the other 48. However, I would double check the amount from the seller before you purchase the product."
3,"no ipod, but that's not why I bought it","I bought this mp3 player for it's ability to record audio through a external microphone jack. I works fine for that purpose. As an mp3 player it down right sucks. The menus are confusing, and the little control thumb stick is hard to use. But it has features that other mp3 players don't, so I'm happy with my purchase."
3,Headphone Jack Didn't Work Properly,"Because I have an IPOD I didn't buy the iFP 780T to listen to MP3s - instead, I bought it to record notes to myself using the voice recorder, and I bought it to record my LPs and then move them to my computer. So, I gave it a go and I hooked the unit up to my mixer and I taped 30 minutes of songs from my records. Then I plugged the headphones into the iFP 780T to liten to what I recorded and sound only came out of one ear. If I plug the headphones in only part of the way it sounds fine (but of course it falls out). I even tried another set of headphones - and got the same results. So, the headphone jack in the unit is faulty and I'm going to have to return it.But, I plugged the unit into my computer and transferred the songs I recorded to my computer and they sound fine on my computer. So that works fine.I'll update this review once I see how iRiver's customer support responds to my faulty unit."
5,Good first Mp3,"Bought this Mp3 and used it consistantly for over a year. The menu's are confusing at times, but overall a good purchase. Fast and friendly shipping too!"
1,A dissapointment,I purchased these clubs for my son who juggles well with balls and wanted to progress. His is 19 and took care when he tried to use them but they fell apart after 2 months of very little use. The company was completely unsympathetic I would recomend trying more expensive ones or from a different company.
3,"Cheep, good for starters","These are decent clubs. Very inexpensive however that may be where the big pros stop. I have owned them for a year or two and they have done ok. The weight nearest the handle has broken off completely on two of the three from dropping them. They aren't balanced very well and they can defiantly hurt your hands catching them. They are also shorter then normal clubs. All in all, these are good for the beginner who is going to practice from time to time but if you are going to juggle more then occasionally, I would go with something with better quality."
1,Weak at best so far.,"I have followed the instructions to the T. I have had it test twice and now it won't even turn on without giving me a PL (polluted) error message.I am going to try and return it to see if they say it is defective, but by the looks of the workmanship I'm not holding my breath.I would try a different brand if I had another chance."
3,"Good pan, but too big!","I didn't see anywhere someone mention that these pans are too big for a normal residential oven. So the hassle of sending them back and then getting the half sized ones began. They looked like good pans, just be sure you know what size you want because these might be too big."
5,Missing Song,"The song listing is missing song #1 on the CD. It is called ""DON'T COME CRYIN' TO ME"", and this is the only CD you can get it on. I attempted to get the song list for this CD corrected thru Amazon, but there is no avenue to have this done. Modern technology for you!!"
4,I Absolutely Loved It!,"Actually I'd give it 4 and 1/2 stars. Before my friend got me this CD for my Birthday I wasn't a big fan of Cher. When I first put it in my player I could not believe how good the songs were, and how powerful Cher's voice sounded. Every song turned out to be great, even the ones I was skeptical about like Bang Bang, I Found Someone and Dark Lady. But I loved all the songs, especially I Got You Babe, Just Like Jesse James, Bang Bang, Heart of Stone and The Way of Love. All of the songs on this CD are classics. My only complaints were about the song Don't Come Cryin' to Me which was the only song I didn't like on the album. Its too bad that Cher's biggest hit Believe wasn't included on the album."
2,"DO YOU ""BELIEVE"" IN CASHING IN?","This ""Greatest Hits"" compilation was only released in the wake of Cher's most recent comeback.Make no mistake, the lady is more a presence than artist, as this collection of songs, which span 25 years, painfully demonstrates.Geffen Records turns in an odd, unbalanced set of tracks. The bulk consists of Cher's stab at rock and roll, eighties style, with a smattering of her early ninties half-hits.Most fun are the handful of early seventies ""classics"": ""Half-Breed"", ""Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves"", et al. Pure kitsch, pure Cher.This disc is only for the true die-hard Cher fan. Most of the earliest cuts have shown up on many previous compilations, at budget prices."
5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST,"this is all cher....her best of all time. from early to now..usually i like only a few songs , but this is one of those albums where every song on it is great. i never grow tired of listening to it. it is a must have."
5,THE BEST COLLECTION OF CHER SONGS EVER!,"I love this cd! I am a young Cher fan and I was capitivated by Believe into buying this cd....and im glad i did! Many of the songs i hadn't heard before, such as ""Love and Understanding"" and ""Save up All Your Tears"". Both of the fore-menchoned are excellent songs. If I Could Turn Back Time is a reason enough to buy this cd, as well as the famous ""I Got You Babe"". I loved it so much i printed out all the lyrics! Cher has outdone herself with this collection, and anyone who already owns this cd i encourage to purchase ""Believe"". Remember Living Proof out in Nov."
4,Special in her own way,"These songs are as slick and over-produced as you could expect for any Cher collection,be it a hits package or some effort of hers that tries (cries?) to get lesser known songs by lesser known artists a piece of the rock n' roll recognition pie.But can you really complain much about the results here? I sure cant.No gimmicky editing was done to any song,and should she be scorned for making ""its in his kiss(the shoop shoop song)""bigger than the original? Hell,she had the vocal and groove to carry that baby,and the overly-critical need a head soaking for being that way.Some of these are her originals,the others are ones she carries home the way others simply couldn't-well...most of the time.If anyone can truly turn back time it is Cher.May the forces be with you-as long as you do it all right."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I received an electric skillet for Christmas and thought this book could help me out in using it....especially for camping recipe ideas and things children might eat - like cooking biscuits and cakes, etc. While it has tons of recipes, they are more ""gourmetish"" than I thought they would be. I wish I had borrowed this book and not purchased it. There are only 3 recipes that I marked that I might actually use."
4,WHERE'D DA 'FROS GO?,"I thought this bunch would burn up the charts with their insane lyrics & slammin', rubbery beats. Maybe they were a little too way out or ahead of their time. The Wayans Bros. understood them!! Their music was overwhelmingly utilized by Rosie Perez & the Fly Girls (which begat Carrie Ann Inaba of the Austin Powers flicks & J-Lo!!) who danced in between skits of the great ""Living Colours"" comedy show. Funky, in-your-face, comedic, cartoonish rap is the best description I can muster. If you like Digital Underground, The Black Sheep, Nappy Roots or The Pharcyde, you'll feel right at home with these big 'fro lyricists. Outstanding are, Feel It, Afros in the House, Jump, This Jams For You & Straight from the Penial. You are guaranteed to sweat yourself nappy!!! YEEAH BOIIIY!!!!!"
2,No Good,Feel it and kickin Afrolistics was the jam kinda back in the day..I liked th4 video cuz all the rappers were in it....the rest of the album in not very good even tho produced mostly by jam Master j...not easy to find but if u like different stuff u might kinda like it...its not very good i promise
1,Not Compatible with Windows XP.,"Dear Public,This version of Epson Perfection does not support the new Windows edition of XP, therefore I would upgrade to a newer epson version of the scanner.Scanner Tester"
1,Why did I bother?,"OK, Hong Kong movies are not known for their subtlety and plot, but this jumped the shark. Characterisation was poor, even for a Hong Kong flick. Supposedly important characters would vanish for half of the film, only turning up to betray the lead character before getting shot. The plot was missing presumed dead and the developement was so garbled, I gave up. You can find decent Hong Kong flicks, but not here."
5,Great sugarcubes and good price,"The boxes arrived on time and in good shape, the sugar is very good. They even enclosed a sample teabag :)I will definitevly order from them again"
1,it came and when i opened it and took out the book the spine of the book fell apart in my hands.,Not happy at all. I recieved the book in not as the condition that is apeared to be. I contacted seller and they never did anything about it. Unhappy.
1,Garbage,As far as I am concerned this game is total garbage and I would not recomend it to any one. I do not know why it was ever released..!! Deer hunter 2003 is the same way I tossed both of them in the garbage. Trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story. The game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers...
4,Nice Book,"I haven't had time to read this book in depth, however, I have skimmed it and it's a very nice book with good information and nice drawings and a few patterns."
2,Book seems like a first draft,"First off, the book refers to it's CD-ROM quite often. After getting about halfway through the the book, I had yet to find one single file referenced in the book to be on the CD-ROM. Basically this book comes with a nice coaster, not a CD-ROM. Her descriptions tend to be vague and they don't always have a begining or an end. Also, I found the number of spelling and grammatical errors to be highly annoying. This is a good book.....if it only cost a couple bucks. It is way overpriced and not worth the money I spent on it."
4,For computer users who know no HTML to those who do,"I checked out three other Pagemill books. One was too specific, giving directions for specific types of web pages, and another was humorously written (and verbose) but didn't teach me what I wanted to know about Pagemill. Rita Lewis is straightforward. She starts at the beginning with an overview of the internet and what can and can't be done with Pagemill, yet is never condescending. The graphics, notes and FYI boxes are informative. It is easy to understand, and well written. I am looking forward to putting together my hompage (and finding out what goodies are on the included CD)"
4,If your technical or just a little this will help.,This book helps you go through the page mill mazes . just that you have to have some knowlage of computers and the net to help out. Yet this is a great book to keep next to you if you need that quick help.
4,around the bend,"One glaring omission..Happiness Is Just Around the Bend, both the vocal and Instrumental version would have made this collector's item truly special."
3,AFXtolin,"What makes this release so great is that the titles to the remixes are very descriptive of what they sound like. However, this is for the completist only."
5,Newman's Best,"This is no ""pop-culture"" film. This is a powerhouse adult drama that is totally gripping, and doesn't let up till the very end. It is nothing short of a crime that Paul Newman lost the Best Actor Oscar to ""Ghandi"" -- a Hollywood fad film that doesn't hold up nearly as well as this superb film. Way to go, Paul!"
2,"interesting melodrama, not very logical or plausible","The theme is stereotyped: wealthy doctors can afford to hire the slickest, most unscrupulous shyster to cover up their mistake. They are helped by a corrupt, cynical judge, who makes the most incredible rulings against the victims. On the other side is an unsuccessful, boozing, fumbling lawyer with all kinds of irritating mannerisms. There is the usual courtroom drama, with the impoverished victims winning against the evil rich people. It's all about class warfare--ordinary people against the ""system"".This is a political caricature. Except for the class-warfare claptrap and irrelevancies (such as the personal shortcomings of the attorney for the plaintiffs) a very thin, predictable piece of nonsense. Too bad such a good actor as Newman got involved."
3,Casual and Uncritical Racism,"Cinematically, I can appreciate ""The Verdict"" as one of Sidney Lumet's finest accomplishments. Unfortunately, the film's casual and uncritical racism dates the story and makes it almost impossible for modern audiences to tolerate.""Frank Galvin"" and ""Mickey Morrissey"" are intended to be protagonists, but their openly racist reactions to ""Dr. Thompson"" baffles moviegoers today who do not consider racists to be ""good guys."" While such casual racism may be an accurate depiction of life in Boston in the 1970s or 1980s, it turns otherwise sympathetic characters into jerks.Not all films translate well in today's culture. This is one of them."
5,Mesmerizing.,"The Verdict is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen in my life. Frankly, I'm not sure what to rave over more--Newman's acting ability or the script itself. Imagining a physically gifted and charismatic man like Newman as an alcoholic loser on his last legs is not an easy thing to do, but his performance accomplishes this seamlessly. As for Mason, what a loss his death was because even nearing the end of his life he could do absolutely everything. His portrayal of Concannon is quite amazing. In O'Shea, Warden, and Rampling the lesser characters become quite major, and the courtroom finale is so good that I watched it several times over again. This should be on everyone's Top 50 list, in my humble opinion."
5,The Verdict (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),"Frank Galvin is a down-on-his luck lawyer, reduced to drinking and ambulance chasing. Former associate Mickey Morrissey reminds him of his obligations in a medical malpractice suit that he himself served to Galvin on a silver platter: all parties willing to settle out of court. Blundering his way through the preliminaries, he suddenly realizes that perhaps after all the case should go to court, to punish the guilty, to get a decent settlement for his clients, and to restore his standing as a lawyer. ""The Verdict"" is simply one of the best legal dramas ever done. This movie captures Paul Newman's finest screen performance and that alone makes it an important movie. The level of acting is high all around in this movie. The summation is about life, not just the law. It is a masterpiece, worth seeing the entire movie for."
5,Paul Nemans The Verdict was Awesome,I got this not knowing what to expect. I didn't watch it when it came out but glad I got the chance to see it. A down and out lawyer takes on a case that is surely a loosing one. No witnesses and everything is on shakey ground. What's in it besides money is pure pride and Newman is not going to let them get the best of him. He turns down offers to end the case early even without a hope or prayer and going up against a shrewd opposing lawyer. As the movie unfolds several characters develop and the movie has a supprise ending. A great ending to a great movie. I was really supprised. Hard to say if this was Newman's best performance but he couldn't have done any better for the type of movie it was.
4,Unsung,"A moving and powerful character arc, with a delightfully evil Charlotte Rampling.The changes that Newman's character go through are inevitable and revealingto the audience without being obvious or crude."
4,Good Bear Market Movie,"Actors Paul Newman and Charlotte Rampling star in this 1982 bear market movie.This movie seems to fit our times when the men we thought we in charge are not doing so well. Here Paul Newman portrays a man full of frailty, hesitancy, and self doubt. This is the kind of damaged hero we can behind in the 20 teens as we march headlong into a greater depression.Attorney Frank Galvin has been beaten down so much he seems like a man twice his age. He is paralyzed by fear. He feels threatened by bad luck. Past experience has been a cruel taskmaster. Here is a weak man who stammers, is hesitant, weak, alchoholic and defeated. Even in the dramatic courtroom scene at the end, Frank Galvin can't get it up. He is halting and hesitant. In keeping with his character in this movie, actor Paul Newman, although nominated, did not receive an Oscar for Best Actor for his role in this film."
3,Surfing culture comes alive,"Atkinson brings the Hawaiian surfing culture to life in her latest Storm Kayama mystery. Kayama, a lawyer, attends a surfing contest at the request of a client's son, but runs into her cousin who is competing. However, she's also present when he receives a threat, an ancient Hawaiian weapon that indicates a call to battle. Storm soon finds herself investigating more than just a threat. The surfing competition soon leads to violence and murder.The ""green room"" is the underwater space where a wave shoves a surfer or where they dive to escape the crushing water. In Atkinson's novel, it's not only an actual threat to Storm's life, but also indicative of the pressure from all sides, the Hawaiian surfers who want to keep the sport pure, the promoters who want to capitalize on commercialism, the clash between cultures.Atkinson uses the Hawaiian culture and language, as well as the surfing story to show the forces that can tear a family, a sport, or an island apart."
2,Sharp Microwave,"I have owned several Sharp Microwaves, but never a refurbished one. I won't own another. It rattles all over, I can't keep the clock set to the correct hour, and the defrost cycle will only work on one setting, there are suppose to be several, so it takes much longer to defrost a large item. I would not recommend anyone buy this product. Spend the little extra and get a new microwave."
2,"Bloated, overpriced, self-serving and superficial","A couple of comments. First, although I enjoyed her first book, ""Second Serve"" very much, I found this one to be a bloated, overpriced, self-serving and superficial attempt at avoiding any real depth about the major interest people have about her, that she is a transsexual. Famous surgeon, male tennis pro turned female tennis pro, tennis coach, whichever, it's still the frank gender stuff that carries the major interest. Although this was present in her first book, it is mostly absent in this one. This could have been more correctly titled, ""No Way Renee: The second and mostly boring half of my notorious life."" In addition, given that the author is a noted opthomologist, it would have been thoughtful for her to have enabled the text-to-speech feature in Kindle for those who are either visually impaired or just want to listen on a Kindle while driving or walking."
4,No Way Renee,"I got very impressed with Renee Richards, her personality, her bravery.I think to myself: What leads a person to do such sort of things?Best regards,Servulo Wilson Correa"
4,Mobile Edge,"Case well made and my 14"" Acer Aspire Timeline laptop fits perfectly. Downside is lack of padding and storage but knew this from other reviews when I ordered. Use for laptop storage and light travel and is perfect for this."
5,"Great fit, quality","Product arrived on time, fit the laptop perfectly, and proved to be a great gift."
5,Great Slipcase,"Fit is excellent for a 14.1 screen laptop, just zips up without any stretching. The neoprene is quite heavy for nice protection. I like the strap on one end for pulling it out of my backpack without squeezing the screen. It has enough depth to accomodate the expanded 12 cell battery on my HP laptop. Very nice product, not too big, like most slipcases that also fit the 15"" laptops."
3,"Fits well, but padding is less than desirable","I bought this neoprene sleeve to add some extra padding to my notebook bag. My Dell Latitude D620 fits very snugly in this sleeve, but I am not thrilled with the padding that it provides. Also the zipper only runs along one side - which is a problem for me because I have to slide my notebook in sideways into my notebook bag. So I have to remove the sleeve completely to get to my notebook. However, overall I am happy with the sleeve and will continue to use it."
4,Solid laptop sleeve,"Perfect fit for a Dell Latitude D620. Works well, no problems so far. I never use the pocket. The neoprene material is relatively thin (at least compared to the last laptop sleeve I owned), but I guess it still offers sufficient protection. The handle is pretty useless, a more substantial one on top would be better."
3,nice product,"This is a nice sleeve. Doesn't quite fit my 14"" Gateway (can't zip it all the way on top). I still used it and stuck it in my carry on. My carry on wouldnt fit a bulkier sleeve."
3,"merchandise fine, description inadequate","It didn't fit. Otherwise, it is about as expected.I wanted a snug fit, but the information was not complete enough to get what I wanted. My laptop measured 14 1/16 X 10 1/4 X 1 3/8 exactly. This was close, but couldn't zip up. I bought a larger Case Logic that was cheaper but isn't as nice."
4,above average quality,"I have a thinkpad T400. this sleeve needs quite some stretch to be fully zipped. however, this is due to the unique design of thinkpad's square instead of rounded corner. I only use it occassionally so it's okay. if i were to use it on a daily base, this sleeve would have been stretched too much to a tearing point in about a month."
2,"Sure sure, whatever.","Thanks for dropping in, Laura, and singing your own praises. Otherwise, this book isn't very good at all, regardless of who wrote it. But if you do think it's amazing, you might be needing to read a few more books."
1,Who REALLY cares who wrote this book?,"It doesn't matter who was behind this collection of stories, because it's just simply not all that good and incredibly derivitive of other/better writings.And, yes, it was published as fiction and doesn't claim anywhere on the dust jacket to be autobiographical--but if anyone who is even half aware of the writer and ""his"" supposed background, it mirrored what the author was telling journalists, magazines, writers, doctors, musicians, actors, agents, etc., as being based on actual events in ""Leroy's"" life which was supposedly being purged via writing. My god, this was a scam/hustle in the most fundemental sense. But if you really want to dive into the pool, you should at least acquaint yourself with the books most of this joke was borrowed from, i.e. anything by Dennis Cooper, some of Mary Gaitskill, and more than a dollop of Flannery O'Connor. The only difference is that those people were/are original and truly talented from the start."
1,Stranger than Fiction,"While I don't share the venom of many of the reviewers I am grateful that I found this book post-scandal rather than before. The writing, which should be at the crux of a review, and not the celebrity of the author, is TERRIBLE. That's what I took away from this book. Terrible writing capitalizing on the stereotypes of people in pain in order to make a profit. I'm not surprised this author turned out to be a hoax, I'm just curious to know why it took everyone so long to figure it out."
2,Gross and Disturbing,Part of you can't put this book down and the other part is thinking why and I reading something so sick.
2,"Read Dennis Cooper instead, go the source","It's just not a very good book, sorry. There's nothing in this book that Dennis Cooper and others haven't done better. Even as a Copper pastiche it still falls way short of the mark.As for Laura Albert, this kind of writing/hoax seems to be a typical American phenomenon: girls, who can't get over the fact that they weren't born as boys. They invest a lot of energy to ""re-invent"" themselves as young males (who never really become adult men) and at the same time reduce their envy by putting boys down (just like in the case of ""Anthony Godby Johnson""). Make them suffer all kinds of abuse, turn them into some weak and miserable beings so that you don't have to envy them anymore (it's therefore only logical that Jeremiah has to wear girl's clothes) - that's it, there's nothing more to say actually. People, who still believe that JT LeRoy is a 25 years old man, should maybe ask themselves why they want to believe it."
1,Ouch!,"What an extreme case of [snooping] envy, mixed up with a love of male genital mutilation. The woman who wrote this certainly has some serious issues, not the least of which deals with boundries and control."
1,"Yes, J.T. LIVES...","In the head of Laura Albert, that is. And that's why the NYTimes just dumped ""Leroy"" and his Deadwood article (because the ""writer"" couldn't provide very basic proof that he wasn't Laura Albert).Naturally, unlike most people who have been wrongly accused of something they aren't guilty of, Laura Albert herself has made no public effort to claim she isn't her creation. As such, none of what's written about in this novel rings true or was based on honest experiences. Although the books by Albert as J.T. makes for an interesting study in penis envy taken to the extreme. Otherwise, nope, nothing in Heart really happened. Faketion, indeed! But if you want to believe J.T. isn't Mrs. Albert, I've got some ocean front property here in Arizona you might be interested in..."
1,Ignore the woman behind the curtain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Actually, don't ignore her. It's not Oz, it's not funny, and it's a sad, sad comment on the state of contemporary literature and the desire for serious artists to feel more connected with ""outsider"" talent, i.e. people who aren't in the insular worlds of West Coast or East Coast art. This hoax does an injustice to those who are truly outside creators, as well as the intentions to help those artists by more established talent. Shame on Laura Albert and Team LeRoy. And shame on Ira Silverberg for covering his ass in The New York Times by pretending he wasn't aware of what was really going on, especially since a lot of unconnected people from New York to Los Angeles--and all points in-between--had pretty much figured something wasn't smelling honest."
1,"I've Read 'em all, and they ain't worth it.","Spend your money elsewhere. There's not a single original idea or voice in any of it, completely ripped off from better writers.Interesting someone would give these books such high ratings without even reading them first. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm..."
1,I must be the dumbest person on earth!,"How can I be the only person alive not to know that J T LeRoy is a fake? I just bought the movie and cried all the way to the end where, they even interview this poor soul. He wants to hide, he acts very weird like someone that's been totally abused in every way possible his whole life. All of Hollywood's A-listers love and Cherish him, They support him so lovingly! He's not real? He's a middle aged housewife in NY?I really can't believe it took me this long to find out! I'm so disgusted with my self. Laura Albert, May you burn in hell! The disservice you've done to abused children everywhere makes me sick! You should be ashamed!"
2,The Objective Eye,"I approached this volume of stories desiring not to be swayed by the current tides of public condemnation, which shouldn't really matter in terms of fiction anyway. Nevertheless, I can honestly say that it isn't importnat who wrote this book. Leroy or Albert, it's still a stinker, and a grand stinker at that. Perhaps now the dialogue should turn toward why so many were willing to praise this book in the first place, because the story, writing, and talent behind these stories is as transparent and meaningful and unique as cotton candy."
1,Not a yuppie...,"and I don't like Oprah. Oh, and guess what...these ""stories"" still sucked. One of the most derivative collections of fiction I've read in recent memory. Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy watching a worm squirming on a hook."
1,The Writer Is Deceitful Above All Things,"Who really cares if this guy ever existed or not, or if it's a middle aged housewife writing it or a former boy hustler, because either way it's sub par prose. If this book had been better I personally wouldn't care who wrote it or why, but it's simply poorly executed and sketchy in every sense. Save your cash on this one and read ""Everything Is Illuminated"" instead (now that's a real writer at work!)."
5,WOW,"I read this book in less than 24 hours. His writing style flows so effortlessly that you forget your reading a book. I need to re-read it to figure out how he did it! It's a hardcore book, but a must-read also. I recommend it to everyone I know. And I found this one to be a better read than ""Sarah."""
3,I don't know really what you are complaining about,"The book said fiction, I own a copy of both Sarah and The Heart is Deceitful and they both say fiction on the back, so stop complaining on what a person said, because it doesn't matter, read the book on merit, and judge from that, if it sucks, it sucks because of the writing, if it's good, it's good because of the writing."
1,Heart is Deceitful Above All Things ---book,"I still haven't finished reading this a year later.since finding out the author made up most of it, or all of it.she's some housewife in New Jersey, which takes my interest away.If it were a true-life account of a kids life I'd have already read the whole book.The movie was pretty good though."
5,A Must Read!!!,"JT has written a truly amazing book. The book is quite difficult to read at times, as the subject matter is painful. He lived through it, though, and has allowed us to take a glimpse at hell. I highly recommend this book. JT lives!!"
2,The Harry Potter of Fakeness,"Not a bad book, not all that good either, but you're better off reading it without any knowledge of the scam behind it. JT or Laura or whoever you are, enjoy it while it lasts because the embers are cooling on you already. Good gag though, almost a funny one.--Janet Lambert"
4,Who cares who wrote it?,"A book is good because of the writing, not because of who wrote it. ""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things"" is a good book. It's a true page-turner, a bit overdone on the shock value, but good nonetheless. I don't care if it was written by JT LeRoy, Laura Albert, Herman Melville, or my cat. I enjoyed reading it, as did many people, though some of them now claim it's a piece of trash just because it wasn't the autobiography they thought it to be. Nowhere in the book does it claim to be autobiographical, and the title is not ""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things: An Autobiography."" The fact people assumed as much only illuminates the cunning skill of author Laura Albert. Her writing reads as autobiographical, a talent few writers possess. Though this book is not the greatest I've ever read, it is certainly good and certainly worth reading. Keep an open mind, and give it a shot."
1,Sickening,"This is a great and entertaining read-- FOR A CHILD-MOLESTING PEDOPHILE, MAYBE!! Laura Albert (the pyschopath behind J.T. LeRoy's hoax) is a disgusting individual. She has written about sex with children and people have praised her. The fact that there is a child in her care disturbs me greatly and now that her cover has been blown, I certainly hope the proper authorities have been notified.The rest of the book is just a joke as well. Although I really enjoyed Sarah (the book, not the character), the writing in this particular piece of junk was bland, the situations blatantly unrealistic and the characters were just plain bad. I can't believe she wasn't figured out after this hit the bookstore shelves."
2,Not enough traction,We have a textured shower floor and have had a problem with anything adhering firmly. This mat does adhere firmly to a textured shower floor but does not provide enough traction. I would like something with a more definitive textured surface.
1,Pure white my butt,"I recently refinished my bathtub in white and wanted something other than suction cup mats. I found this and purchased it hoping for a permanent solution to my problem. I got it in, laid it out to flatten for a day or so, and went to install it. Not even close to white. It's more of a greyish color that sticks out like a sore thumb."
1,what a disappointment,"My already prepared bathtub and I were ready to install the ""WHITE?"" mat, then when I put it over my white tub to check the measures, my eyes could't beleive what they saw: the mat was PALE GREY...And even worst, I bought two of them."
4,So far so good....,"Our bath had a bad peeling surface from a previous treatment. I had tried paints etc, but nothing lasted.This seems an ideal solution. Fitted it very easily and it's been down a few weeks now with no problem.It is a grey colour though when put on a bright white bath. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars....."
4,Just what I wanted in a bathmat,"This mat is just as good as the $40 one I had to replace. Although it is relatively smooth feeling, it definitely is non-slip. I'm so glad I found this one for such a good price. It would be perfect if it was transparent but you can't have everything and non-slip is the most important thing."
3,slip resistant but turns ugly in a hurry.,I like the idea that I have a non-slip bath mat for my baby but this thing is hard to clean and gets awfully dirty after a few uses. I'm not sure if you can design this another way but was I disappointed at my permanently dirty tub!
4,Not Quite Perfect,"I saw a similar tub mat in a hotel and loved the low profile. This mat is the same color of my tub so it blends well. It adheres very strongly, which is great because I was concerned with corners peeling.My only issue is that it's more slippery than I'm comfortable with, so I have to be a little more careful.That is all."
4,good player,i purchased this player of ebay for 30 dollars it has a lot of cool features for the price but the downside is it does not have the best battery life only about 8 hours the pair of earbuds are great better than ones i bought for 15 dollars but it is not very durable i put it in the cd player compartment in my back back and when i tryed to play a cd it said OPEN but i fixed it this palyer is good if you just want to listen at home or in a car and stuff like that. The volume is very loud unlike some of these people have said.
4,Spurgeon: A New Biography,"I have not finished with the book yet. My pastor, Jerry Johnston, told me to read it. I am interested in having some of Spurgeon's books of sermons in my library. I have found it an easy read and easier to understand than the 4 volume biography probably would be. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get a basic idea about Spurgeon's life, then go to the 4 book biography for a more indepth look at his life, if you so choose."
1,Much too large and heavy,The book weighs 3 lbs and is 9 by 2 1/4 - it is too big and heavy to pack or to carry around.
2,not illustrated,"I bought this book and returned it. I did not make a scientific count, but it appears that about 1/2 or more of the birds covered are ""not illustrated"". I am a casual birder and need a picture to get started. The 2 birds I had hoped to identify for certain, a possible cuckoo and ovenbird, were ""not illustrated""."
3,"Good, but a bit cumbersome","This book seems to be a pretty thorough look at the birds of Mexico. It is a little difficult to use, but it does have a lot of information."
4,Beginner Birder in Mexico,"I am a beginner self-taught birder and did some birding north of Puerto Vallarta and in San Blas. This Guide does not have colored plates for any aquatic birds, so I recommend using a complimentary book on western North American birds such as Sibley's. This guide is cumbersome on it's own, so using 2 books was more so. Despite this, I learned alot from Howell's entries of habits and similar species to help me identify specific species. Additionally, Howell's Bird-Finding Guide to Mexico with checklists helped me hone in on species of the area.A perfect world would be to revise this Guide into sections of Mexico, and organize it similarly to Sibley. A guide could then be smaller, more specific and less cumbersome. One must keep in mind, however, that Mexico has an abundance of birds (the 10th most in the world, I understand) so this Guide is naturally thick. Anyone I encountered who is a birder referred to this Guide as THE book to have for birding in Mexico."
4,Almost Excellent,"This book is excellent for a trip to Mexico; however be warned, some of the most common birds are not pictured in the plates. While all of the species not found in the US have colorful plates, there are no plates for waterbirds such as gulls and no plates for the warblers or flycatchers other than endemics; however, there are descriptions and location maps for all birds found in Mexico. If you visit during migration, and have trouble remembering fall plumage distinctions on migrating warblers, be sure to bring a Sibley or Peterson guide along with you as well!"
2,Ridiculously heavy & pictures are small inset in center,"I really don't like the pictures-separate-from-the-text format in birding books. It's tedious and silly. Also, the sheer amount of text in this book is staggering. I needed a take-along guide with pictures adjacent to text, not this behemoth."
3,Not exactly a field guide,"I purchased this book before going to Mexico for a three-month research trip. While this guide is fairly complete, it is more than a little cumbersome to take along on any birding expedition. Also, some of the illustrations seem cartoon-like, especially after seeing the real bird in the wild. However, the general information at the beginning of the book about birding in Mexico was helpful, and it helped to initiate some interesting discussions with local nature guides."
1,author should have hired a professional indexer,The index is not usable and takes away any serious utility of this book. Was this a computer-generated or author-generated index? Bad idea on both.
5,The Best Ambiant Album I have ever heard,"On occasion, you find a recording that truly is ground-breaking. Stearns' Planetary Unfolding is such a recording. Why this album is no longer available is a mystery to me. Michael's ability to alter the consciousness of the listener is un-matched by anyone I have ever heard. Perhaps some of the Aphex Twin's ambient recordings or Robert Rich at his best would be a close second. If you can find this recording, buy it ASAP. A classic, especially considering it was recorded in the mid 1980's. Other Stearns' recordings are good, but nothing compares to Planetary Unfolding in my view."
5,A True Ambient Masterpiece,"I was fortunate enough to find this CD at a little CD shop in Austin, Texas. Unfortunately this was in 1993. This is Stearns' best in my opinion. I use this CD for meditation and relaxation. This is a defenite favorite among my vast music collection."
3,This band remained true to the original arrangements,"For this project the band came up with the idea to use the original charts for the big bands they were playing a tribute to. This is not a bad idea for with our modern technology, it stands to reason that the sound of a new recording would be fantastic. Wow! This band created a knock out sound. They accomplished their goal.This band is a fine compliation of musicians. They all played together really well and used a high engery approach. I can't get over their total sound and individual sound. They are great!The repertoire used was a good one. They did play a few songs that I didn't like or know. This was the only dark side to this cd. All and all I think this is a cd to be proud of."
4,Good Book,"I felt it was a little heavy handed on getting kids to read. It's a great message. It's just that kids don't want to be preached to, but I do think it's a good book and great for the child who loves animals and especially cats.Author of ""Hobo Finds A Home"""
3,Beautiful at times. Annoying at others.,"Sufjan has an incredible talent for writing beautiful lyrical and musical melodies, and he does so on this most recent album. Like ""Greetings..."", the hook of the initial progression of many of the songs grabbed me, but there is often a point where the songs build, and a full band kicks in. Unfortunately, the repetitive back-up vocals and droning organs significantly take away from the songs. The production decisions are invasive of the stripped down and otherwise beautiful guitar, banjo, and vocals. While I initially love the songs, I find myself skipping to the next song when Sufjan heats things up with his back-up help."
5,If Only Sufjan Would Stay With This Style.....Great CD,"I made my way to Sufjan Stevens by way of Iron and Wine. This CD was suggested to me by a friend, and I must say it is has some of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I've heard in quite a while. I am not a big fan of Sufjan's newer work, which evidently puts me in the minority. I wish he wouldn't have abandoned the intimate, acoustic style that dominates Seven Swans. He has a lot to say, and says it very well with just an acoustic guitar and minimal arrangements. I would suggest this CD to anyone who enjoys artists such as Iron and Wine, Elliot Smith, or M. Ward...... good acoustic guitar, strong songs, with lyrics that go beyond Jack Johnson's 5th grade drible. I can only hope Sufjan makes his way back to this style, at least once in a while."
4,Very good,I'm new to Sufjan. I first heard of him 30 days ago. This is a very good CD. Simple and pleasant music and wonderful vocals. I can't wait to get the other CD's by Sufjan.
5,Genius,"What else is there to say? Surjan Stevens is a genius. Certainly a musical genius, but possibly an all around genius. There are moments on this album that make me shake my head and want to cry they are so beautiful. The line ""I have a sister somewhere in Detroit"" emerges like a great black hawk at dawn, sucking us in, and dropping us down. (I have the vinyl and this comes at the end of side one.)I must add that I listened to this album about half a dozen times on faith before it began to work its way under my skin. It's subtle and rich in its effect. Don't give up on it!! After listening about a dozen times I sat down one day and played it loud. All of a sudden it was as if I'd been hit with a hammer in the chest. Magical, truly magical."
4,Really Good,"This isn't my favorite Sufjan album, but it's still freaking amazing. For fans of Iron & Wine and the like, this is a really good choice. If you want something with more of a variance of instruments and which can draw no comparisons, go with ""A Sun Came"" or ""Illinois,"" both of which I would grant six stars were it possible."
5,Great Sufjan Album,"This album is one of Sufjan's best and a great introduction to his music. I bought Michigan and Illinoise before buying this one, but I wish I had bought this first. The lyrics and arrangements are simple, intimate, and beautiful. I highly recommend buying this album if you want something relaxing and low-key but with deep meaningful lyrics."
2,Did Not Hold my Attention,"I'm not a big fan of non-fiction, but I am an avid reader and have been coaching Little League for a number of years. Normally, I think most non-fiction texts can and should be shrunk down by 90% and placed in a magazine so their narrative doesn't run dry. This book is a solid case in point. I got bored after four chapters and had to put the book down. It's not that the writing was bad, it's that the book went into too much detail about people I didn't care about.If only this were an article in Sports Illustrated!"
3,Nice keyboard for the Palm PDA,"Why write a review on a product so old? Because I still use the old PDA, until my wireless telephone provider lets me upgrade my phone. This sleek keyboard works through the IR port on the Palm. The keyboard buttons are a little small and the space key is split. It takes some getting used to but the keystrokes are accurate. It 'converts' the PDA to a tiny 'laptop'.Set up takes about 30 seconds to open the case, lock the keyboard and pull the stand. Then you take out the metallic supports for the PDA. It is stable and the PDA does not rock. Software driver loads on the PDA to activate it. There is a conflict when the driver is activated and you surf the net on the PDA.Other than that, I recommend this item. That is, if you still have a Palm. Ha Ha!"
5,great knife,"one of the best all around, multi purpose knives in the kitchen. works great as a gift to get somebody started on a nice wustof collection."
4,Una época apasionante y buena investigación,"Una gran España imperial, una impresionante Venecia marina, la rica Génova, los estados pontificios y la Orden de Malta se unen para enfrentar a los invencibles turcos otomanos. El libro relata el contexto, el antes y el después de la batalla, que, si bien, tuvo un efecto efímero en el campo político-militar, es un punto de no-regreso en la historia del mediterráneo y de Europa y Asia, en general. Ahora, para el lector aficionado, es un libro de lectura no tan fácil y de corrientes sinuosas. Esto principalmente debido a un cierto grado de Erudición del libro y a que las cartas ""[E]stan scriptas [e]n Español antiguo"" (Pero es realmente un placer leer esas cartas, en realidad no es un lastre). Sin embargo las cartas y los relatos son tan apasionantes que realmente lucen este trabajo. Lo recomiendo fuertemente para todo aficionado a la historia."
5,Humminbird 7300101 Temperature Sensor,"A few years ago I purchased a sensor for my Humminbird depth finder and it workedfine. As time passes and use is incured, things wear out and eventually break.I found this sensor on Amazon and ordered it for my depth finder. NO PROBLEM installing, and most of all the delivery was fast,and the sensor worked as soon asI plugged it in. Overall a pleasant shopping experience."
3,Trainers and Dieticians Gone Mad,"The Perfect PlanetThis was my second book by Ms Smith and far superior to the other. It is a good read for a rainy weekend, although a bit heavy handed at times. Ms Smith lampoons the culture of beauty and fitness as it existed in the early 1960s. Perfect Planet will be a minor SF classic in time."
2,Wicked Wyoming Nights,"I usually enjoy this author's books,but found the main characters a little unbelievable. The lead female character, Eliza, became quite unlikable as the story progressed, and frankly, annoyed me. The lead male character is written as a strong man with deep convictions, yet he seems to have no reaction when betrayed over and over again by the women he supposedly loves. Eliza's uncle commits a horrific crime in front of the sheriff and apparently is never even arrested. My opinion, pass on this one."
5,Buy this now.,"This manga is great. There are many different situations in this, which I like. There are even a few pages in color, which is uncommon for manga! It has fantastic characters (mostly Shin and Mitzi) but the humor you get from them is some of the best you'll get from any manga. My only complaint is that the books are short. I don't want them to end! If you've seen the show, you'll love this just as much."
5,Very funny commedy.,It is very hard to describe this manga. It is one of my favorite and I even went to the extent of translating a few of the stories and placing them on my website in the hope that it would help to create more US fans for it. Very recommended.
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!","If you're looking for a peice to play in church or at a Christian event, I would really reccomend this book. After 5 years of playing, I had some small trouble with the rhythm, but nothing a little counting didn't solve. I wouldn't reccomend this book for beginners, but for people in high school, or even in college, or is you just want something fun to play, this book is a must."
3,"Unfortunately, this is the only small Norwegian-English dictionary that I know of","As far as I know, this is the only pocket-sized Norwegian-English dictionary available. It has 319 pages, special sections for food and drinks, numbers, and telling time. There is a useful but limited English to Norwegian mini-grammar which includes 3 1/2 pages of irregular verbs and a concise explanation of using articles with nouns. The grammar is missing some simple key information, such as how to form the past and future tense of regular verbs.The Norwegian to English 'g' section of the dictionary starts with ""gi"". Apparently, the first part of the 'g' section was cut out by the editor. Very strange. I wonder what else is missing from the book.Einar Haugen's Norwegian-English dictionary doesn't have much grammar but is a far more comprehensive and useful dictionary than this one. It is not pocket-sized, however and does not have an English to Norwegian section."
4,Freddie's back!!!!,I am so excited that Freddie is back. (And he looks great I might add!) I have to admit that I would rather have an album of new material but this is still a really solid release and one that I would strongly recomend to any old school fans or to someone just looking for some great soul singing. Freddie lost a lot of weight but he did not lose any of the power or beauty that makes his voice so amazing. I also like the song choice. Can't wait for some new original material but this will hold me over for the time being.
3,Plain Vanilla,"I like it when artist reach back and grab a bunch of songs from back in da day. Sometimes they can make the song their own by putting their touch to it. Luther V was a master at it. But Freddie brings nothing new to the table with this collection. All of the original versions sound better. Not that this is a bad CD, if you are a diehard Freddie Jackson fan. They keyword there is ""diehard"". It might make good background music since almost all of the songs are ballards. Nothing on this Cd made my ears perk up. But some people like plain vanilla."
2,Rusts too much to really be stainless steel,"When I purchased this shower caddy, it claimed to be stainless steel, but it now has so many rust spots I highly doubt if it really is. I paid more for this shower caddy than I would normally pay thinking that it would be rustproof. Well, it isn't. So if you are looking for a shower caddy that won't rust, save your money don't buy this one. I'm not sure if there is anything better out there, but this definitely isn't it."
1,Maybe worth more stars if military interest,I rated this a one to get your attention. This book is not about building all dioramas but is only military focused. It may be good for that aspect but it is not about builiding any other theme. There is nothing I could find in the description that it was mainly military themed. I returned it free with prime. You can find most diorama info in an internet search or Woodland Scenics.
5,Perfect book for the modeller!,Wow! Excellent book of lots of dioramas and perfectly built kits. Sheperd Paine professionally and easily explains how to build realistic dioramas and he even focuses on giving tips about painting models and figures. Very very useful book for the modellers who are willing to add extra realism to their dioramas and kits. Very highly recommended! You won't be dissapointed!
5,HEY...IT'S TONY!!,"what can I say about the great Tony Williams that hasn't been said before? One of the all-time great drummers. I love this CD because it swings and I love the straight-forward jazz on it. Oh yeah, the players aren't too shabby either! As a big-time fan of rock music I've always liked the way Tony would sound like a rock drummer at times, and I don't mean he sounds like a rock drummer trying to play jazz, far from it. He doesn't seem to tune his drums as tight as most jazz players and his playing can be quite forceful. His catalog is too extensive for me to rate this album with his others but this is a real nice jazz CD and thoroughly enjoyable.www.electriceyes.us"
5,48 Championship Basketball Drills,"Great instructional DVD/Video for youth basketball coaches! Not to basic, but not to complex for beginners to understand. Our department has purchased a number of these to loan out to all our volunteer coaches for review. It offers good instruction & explanations of all the drills. It also suggests the time involved in each drill as well as the appropriate age levels each drill applies to.It's easy viewing as a sit-down ""watch it all at once"" instructional film, but also works well as a quick reference to a particular drill or instructional segment. Very well done and a worthy investment."
5,Basketball Coaching:Dynamic Basketball Drills & Skills For Practice Organization!,"Some of the best drills I've seen to help coaches organize practices.48 CHAMPIONSHIP BASKETBALL DRILLS is presented in such a way, there are no boring moments.Even though I spotted more than one fundamental ""faux pas"", there is enoughin this program to energize any coach, parent or player. Recommended highly!"
4,Good starting point,The drills provided in this disk provide a very good starting point for new coaches putting together there first practices.
5,"The road to the ""Final Four""starts here!","Terrific general basketball drills! Don't be caught up with famous coaches and their videos & books, this is where you should start if you want to run an effective practice and see your team improve. I coach my 12 year old recreational team and used all the drills in this video over a period of 4 months. I found my practices to be better run with these nice assortment of drills. The narration will give some good tips that I probably should have known but did not. For instance, a defender should always try to block a shooters shot with his left arm because most shooters are righty and the defenders left arm is closer to his shooting hand. Good stuff like this is throughout the video. At the end of the video they give you a few sample practices which are very helpful. All in all great value for the money!"
5,First Rate Basketball Drills,"This DVD is first rate for those looking for a variety of basketball drills. The drills are divided into different topics such as shooting, rebounding, passing etc. The DVD menu makes it easy to navigate and all the drills seem useful though I always found myself going back to the wonderful shooting drills. Basketball technique is not the main objective but there is a nice section on form shooting. Coaches from the youth level through middle school will achieve the most success instituting these drills in their practice sessions. This is a definite thumbs up!"
4,GRINSPOON ROCK,"Grinspoon are 1 of my favorite bands. I got this CD when I was holidaying in the U.S. And it kicks ass. It may not have ""Just Ace"" but there are alot of other great songs. I would recomend this album to every American who likes alternative or Rock music. So buy this CD now!"
3,Needs a bit of improvment,"Pretty good album by Grinspoon, but needs alot of work, there are some real good songs like ""Post Enebriated Anxiety, ""Black Friday,""More Than You Are"", ""Pedestrian"" ""Bad Funk Stripe"" and ""Sickfest"" but the rest are really bad.I can't believe all you people are writing all these good reviews about this album, when half of the songs i can't bare listening to anymore."
1,5 stars from all their friends,This band always interupts my festival experience with their talentless dribble. The lead singer should not try to scream during a song because it comes across as sounding like a fat kid with asthma climbing over a brick wall. no stars (if i could)
4,METAL GUIDE TO THE GALAXY,"Australian metal band with a philosophical handle on star-struck hit making angst, battling the demons of rock and roll success via cool control over thumping bass line guitar, bewildered teen vocals, and just enough tender reverb to give the songs memorable hooks and riffs. Picture a young, crownless James Hetfield fronting a more melodic Cannibal Corpse and scowling at barracuda record executive types as in ""NBT"", or 'next big thing'. If this sounds a bit pompous, it comes across as a genuine love of metal in familiar thump and grind structures that often slip into quieter, more thoughtful angst, as in the nearly apologetic, metal defending, ""Bad Funk Stripe"", and the fluid, bar-gazing, ""Repeat"". The band's individual roles aren't credited on the CD, but the vocals, scowling and lung busting one moment, meek and vulnerable the next, give the band both a youthful zest and wizened maturity."
4,Solid live album,"If you're already a Testament fan, then LoL is a great addition to your collection. If you're new to Testament, then this is a great way to sample their early material without buying all the CDs (see also: First Strike Still Deadly--a re-recording of material off their first two albums). This is a good, solid live album.Recommended."
5,Great sound.....classic Testament!,You have to get this cd! This line up is killer and the sounds is like being right there in front line. If you wanna hear some real trash metal you should get this!! totally worth your money buy this!
4,Como Descubrir Sus Vidas Pasadas by Ted Andrews,Buena elección. Ted Andrews relata de manera práctica distintas maneras de explorar las vidas pasadas. Recomendado para las personas que dan sus primeros pasos en este tema ya que contienen ejemplos sencillos e ilustrativos que no implican ningún tipo de riesgo.
3,quality versus noisy/long warm-up,"I can't agreed with some reviews any better. This printer offers quality printing, though it's not uncommon anymore with nowadays color inkjets from Epson or HP,but does take some annoying and grinding minutes to warm up. Annoying because of the semi-endless rattling when you least want to be bothered with noise. Use it sparingly because of its costly cartridge but beware of the warm-up."
3,And it's noisy...,"Being a typical college student, I typically work right up to the deadline for projects.So when it's time to print out that research paper and jolt to class, it's really annoying to be delayed five minutes to wait for endless buzzing and grinding to stop and actual printing to begin. I've finally learned to restart the printer when I sit down at my computer to work.Another thing... When printing text at normal resolution it sometimes comes out distorted and kind of smudged. I end up using the higher quality resolution, but that takes more time and ink.Compared to my old Epson Stylus Color, this printer is only marginally improved. I do have a number of complaints, but until somebody makes the ""perfect printer,"" I'll just stick with the relatively superior Epson printer series."
5,Epson 850 is a great printer,"I have been using an Epson 850 for two years. It always works, always makes great looking pictures, and is fast for what it costs. Cheapest place to buy refill ink, that I have found, is Target."
2,Don't listen to the commercial below!,"What's this other person below talking about? Is he reading a script? I have this printer, and it .... It prints a lot of dots, and the coloring is often not what it should be. I've had it cleaned and everything. It just isn't a good printer. VERY loud, and takes a good 3-4 minutes to warm up before you can do anything with it. Buy something else like I should have."
4,The product is both tasty and filling. I love it!,"Not only is this protein crunch filling and tasty, it's also kinda fun to eat! I mix fruit and plain yogurt in another container and mix in your product. In my opinion, its great! GOOD JOB!!"
5,Best High Protein Cereal I have tried,"I have tried at least 5 other brands of ""high protein"" cereals on the market and this is by far the best of them. It has a sweetness that has a hint of honey which is just enough. I also like the texture...it's crunchy, but will soften up when you put milk on it. It's definately worth trying."
5,My Favorite Cereal,"I haven't found another cereal that is even close to this tasty that is also no fat, LOW sugar and plenty of PROTEIN!! Give it a couple of minutes after pouring on the milk--then it will be nice and crunchy without threat of breaking a tooth! I can't find this in my grocery store anymore, so thanks Amazon for making this available."
4,What ever happened to Amp on MTV?,"Zen TV on DVD is great. It has cool videos you can't find anywhere else. They used to play these type of videos on amp on MTV at 1 am. I loved that show. The highlights of this DVD in my opinion are Animal Chin, Sweetsmoke, Get A Move On, Timber, Rockit Soul, Sculpture, Pinball # Count, Sunflower Girl, and The Hexstatic Music Mash-up. All the videos are worth watching though. The RARE artsy VR music videos make for good conversation or just to trance out to. I enjoy the album sleeve gallery music and the 60 minute mix. All in all it makes for a unique musical experience. If you're bored with the same ol', let this stimulate your mind."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR NINJA TUNE FAN,"35 MUSIC TRACKS & THE VIDEO IF YOU LIKE ELECTRONIC MUSICK THIS IS A MUST HAVE. THERE IS NOTHER MORE I CAN SAY. BEST DVD ""EVER"""
2,Amon Tobin saves the day!,"I'm a big fan of Ninja Tune but their music videos suck! Except for Amon Tobin's the rest are bland. I like 'scratch video' art but those by Coldcut are just boring. Better invest your money in the ""Director's Series - The Works of Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham, and Michel Gondry""."
3,Need a little help with this one,"I am an old fan of spacey music. My roots are in heavy classic material but I have very much ventured out to ambient, jazz, space rock and many other types. I love Ozric Tentacles and Porcupine Tree when in the Psych/Spacey mode. Hawkwind seem to be a staple of spacey hard driving music based on reviews and their popularity. I need to know why this album is one of their top sellers. I bought it but don't see the magic in this. This is average garage burnout music (I should know, I'm one of the burnouts). I find it generally pleasing and do play it from time to time but nothing here that strikes me. Someone please recommend where to go in the Hawkwind collection to experience the greatness that is cast upon this band. I'm ready. I'm willing .. but not getting it thus far."
5,This album has stood the test of time,"I first bought this album when I hosted ""The Mellow Sounds"" (an all-metal program) on KXLU-FM (88.9 in LA) in the mid-70s. While there are more than a few records I have trashed since then, Hawkwind still does it for me, and I'm sure other Friends of Jef™. They were unique then, they still are 30 years later. Got to love that Mellotron! Great tunes to ""space out"" to. I've long since copied my vinyl to MP3 and was playing it at work. All these young pups are going ""wow - great music. Who is it?"".If you're new to Hawkwind, as other reviewers have said, you just can't go wrong with Hall of the Mountain Grill! It kicks! Long live Beenzon Toste!"
4,Bike jersey,"Bought this for Christmas for my son. He said it runs a little small, but he liked it...."
1,EXTREMELY INNACURATE!,"I purchased an early release of this CD because I have always been a fan of Larry's music. I was not just dissappointed in it's message...I WAS OUTRAGED! Since I have watched it,I have spoken with 7 people who appeared in the film. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM told me their words were taken out of context,and they had mostly good things to say about Larry. This so-called ""film maker"" needs to repent and apologise to the Norman family and the other artists he used nd abused in making this film ONLY to line his own pockets. Larry is no longer with us to defend himself,yet his music is still touching the lives of many. That alone,in my opinion,outweighs the blatant lies told in the WORK OF FICTION!"
1,***WARNING***Most positive reviews were FAKED.,".Be forewarned: most positive reviews were FAKED.Take a look at most of the positive 5-star reviews (click on ""See all my reviews"" next to the reviewer's name).The VAST majority of them were all done within a few days, by a person who had never done any OTHER reviews of ANY sort -- before or after.Glad I checked into this before wasting my money and contributing to an obvious ""hit piece"" on Larry Norman based on a BOGUS rating!"
1,Lies + Fabrications,This film is nothing but lies + fabrications about Larry. Do an online search and you will find out the truth about Larry Norman a man after God's own heart!
5,i Like it,I like a lot this movie. The strory is amzing and the actors are very good. I enjoy my time seeing this movie
5,5 Stars - I love it.,"The movie is awesome,the experience i saw i just cannot believe it.I can recommend this movie to anyone,the intro is really good and the acters well-performed it.If you are having doubts go on and buy it,next thing you have to do is watch it i tell you its awesome.Again 5 stars from me."
1,Great battery,"My camera was doing all sorts of crazy things.. like zooming when i am trying to take a picture.. So i ordered a replacement battery... hey, it works like it did when it was new...."
2,Two dead in only a year and a half,"I'm a bit upset that I bought this great camera, then had to buy a rechargeable battery and charger pack to go with it, then bought another battery so I'd always have one spare charging. While I've really had good success with the camera (though its photos in dark places are lousy), when the batteries start running low, the CCD takes progressively worse photos. Now, the real icing on the cake is the rechargeable batteries start losing their capacity within 6 months, and by the time they are a year-and-a-half old, they only get 5 minutes of time on them before saying ""Low Battery"" and shutting down the camera. And that's with the LCD OFF!!! I'm not at all pleased. I will be buying two more, though, to extend the life of my lovely camera. It's cheaper to buy more batteries than a new camera, anyway..."
4,"Great, but petered out after 2 years","I purchased a set of these batteries for my Powershot S20 and until recently they have been fantastic. I only charged them when they are completely dead and did not leave them on the charger for much longer than needed. But now after 2 years, they no longer hold their charge and I can only take about 5 photos before I get the low battery icon. At this price, I was hoping they would have lasted a lot longer. They were really good while they lasted, though."
1,Battery shot,"I didn't ""top off"" but did make the (apparent) mistake of leaving charged battery on charger. Now it won't hold charge. I recommend against buying any camera that requires this type rechargeable."
3,can be fixed with duct tape,"These are OK when new, but after a while they suddenly fail and then are only good for a few shots. This often happens if you leave them in the charger too long, but it is not convenient watching the charger for 2 hours to see when it is done. All 3 I have bought have failed in this way.It seems that there is a diode inside that fails allowing the charge to leak out throught the center contact. When this happens, just stick a piece of duct tape over the center contact before you put it in the camera and it is as good as new. Remove the duct tape to recharge it."
2,Canon marketing,"Yes, the rechargeable battery is necessary for saving the $8 each on disposable batteries. But no, it is not a panacea. I was amazed when my rechargeable battery went dead after just 1 year of occasional use. If I'd known it went dead this early and there was only one manufacturer (Canon) to buy from, I would not have bought the camera. Grrrr."
1,Ghostwriter is a pedo.,"We all know that VC Andrews is gone.Andrew Neiderman has now taken over the books and writes the newer series. Let me tell you that this is complete garbage. I wish I could return this and get my money back.The issue in the book is that the girl who is like 10 I think, has early puberty she is developed and her creepy ass brother runs test on her, feeling her up. She gets molested. I had to stop reading. Honestly this book made me sick and I have read worse but this one made me feel gross reading it. Even though its fiction I felt bad."
1,Stopped half way thru,"I read alot of VCA books when I was a young adult. I loved the Flowers in the Attic series. This one I couldn't finish. It never got to the point. It dragged on and on and on about the puberty issue. Geez....then when the brother touched the sister, I had enough. Sorry I can't agree with the fantastic reviews of some of the other viewers, but this book just didn't cut the mustard!!!"
1,Ewww,"I've been a fan of V.C. Andrews' through everything-including her death! However, this book finally pushed me to the limit. As a fan of V.C. I'm clearly a fan of the grotesque and macabre, but this exploration of a seven-year-old's sexuality went too far. My stomach was churning the whole time. Yes, I understand that this is a real phenomenon-early puberty-but something as disturbing as someone who not too long ago was wearing diapers menstruating is a medical issue, not one that should be put in gothic hack fiction as ""sexy"". Psychologically a child of seven could never handle such an event and I found the addition of a character who wanted to ""introduce"" the child to her ""new feelings"" so upsetting I decided to give up the ghost, literally (the ghostwriter) for good. He went over the edge, and not in a good way. I felt molested reading this book, and I have a baby girl, and I certainly wouldn't ever want her to read it. I recycled it."
1,Poor,"I have to state from the start the only book I ever liked by V.C. Andrews was ""Flowers in the Attic."" The dialogue was simplistic but at least the story was interesting. I read the next in the series and it was terrible. I read the third in the series and gave up midway.Someone gave me Broken Flower and having nothing else to read I am attempting to read it but I won't last long. To a degree the characters are the same as in Flowers. Last night I read Ian who molested his sister is going to be a doctor. How many times can this story be rehashed?The mother's grief over precocious puberty is so over the wall it is pathological, especially in this day and time when it is common. I had a child with precocious puberty and that was 15 years ago.Usually I am happy that people read no matter what they read but I hate these characters. I hate these storylines. I feel badly that people don't read books of better quality."
3,No continunity,"The ghost writter seriously sucks at continuty. The book stands alone but when taken as part of a series, which it is, it sucks. In this book the girl is seven and had her period, in the next book she was older when her period started. I hate it when there is no continuty!"
1,Nasty!,I stopped at the first chapter! When I read something along the lines of don't let Grandma see your pubes I couldn't continue.I'm a HUGE VC Andrews Fan and I have read a lot of her books. Everyone one of her books I've read has gotten me hooked. This one made my skin crawl.
2,Confusing mixture of comedy/tragedy.,"I was also reminded of the movie ""Miss Congeniality"" when I read this book--beauty pageant world turns nasty. But no one was hurt in the movie; even the violence at the end was slapstick comedy. What bothered me about the book was that the mixture of silly romantic comedy and psychological thriller didn't work. The ugly undertones and tragic climax did not fit the light ""tone"" of the book. And the Epilogue went right back to silliness, as though nothing bad had happened. I would have given it 3 stars up until the end."
5,The best recording of Brahms Clarinet Trio I've ever heard,"This is definitely the best recording of Brahms Clarinet Trio I've ever heard. It easily surpasses Sony's Stolzman/Ma/Ax recording in both interpretation and sound quality. Beethoven's trio is very good as well, and Glinka's Trio pathetique is a pure delight. Highly recommended."
1,Tweeters aren't what they used to be.,"Had these tweeters before the quality was a little better back then. Fell apart and threw them away before I could even get them mounted. Take the money you would spend on these add a little to it, and buy something better."
2,frustrating!,"bought a pyle gear 6x8 ...awesome! but this pyle plus made my frustrations :( installation was easy and comes with crossover..plastic finish is not that good..but the sound quality is nice..in the first 2 weeks! noticed that it is releasing crackling sound on one of the tweeters...i suspected my HU settings so I adjusted, the same thing..logically if the HU setting was bad for the tweeters, it should blown also the other one..can't increase my volume level for the mean time till i purchased a new tweets... will try kicker to blend with my subs that i also purchased here in amazon :)"
1,Trust me on this!,"I purchased two PMW A230 Portable PA's from Pyle and discovered that they were a bit weak on high frequency response.Low and behold, Pyle solved this in the A850 model by adding a small tweeter.Well, I did a search and found that Pyle made a small tweeter that looked like it would fit into one of the baffle ports on the speaker enclosure.It didn't appear to be a critical mod as the next series up had it's tweeter mounted in the same hole.I was also impressed that the tweeter came with a cross over.Mounting was fairly easy and so was the hook up.I even made sure that the tweeter was phased properly.Pro'sTweeters are made by Pyle and are labeled as such.Very easy to mount and hook up. A little modificationis necessary.Cons: (both units)Very Very Very Very low output.Distorted audio.I plan to find a better tweeter and crossover and start over.Save your money...."
4,Interesting footnote of history,"""The Frozen Water Trade"" is an interesting chronicle of a long dead and forgotten industry. In this book, a story is told about how a particular idea first considered to be absurd, but then grows to a tremendously large business all around, and then impacts other later industries (such as beer brewing in Milwaukee) and then ultimately capitulated from the march of technological progress.In many ways, I found the actual specifics about the business of selling ice as interesting as the general story about 19th century business life, such as dealing with relics from the mercantilist age in the caribbean to the business like of 19th century Boston shipping magnates. If the concepts that I am describing sound interesting to the slightest, then this book will not disappoint."
4,Story of a Forgotten Industry,"Mr. Gavin tells a very good tale of how Fredric Tudor took the seemingly absurd idea of selling ice and turned the idea into what was one of America's largest industries of the 19th Century.What I found most captivating - more so than the biographical aspect of the book - was how Gavin put ice in perspective in America. It was a huge industry producing millions of dollars a year and employing thousands (many on a seasonal basis), yet because it was not taxed there is very little hard data. Moreover, ice appears to have been a primarily American love in the last century. Only after WWII did the rest of the world pick up our affinity for cold drinks and food. These perspectives make the book more than a biography or ""how they done it"" book and makes it worth reading.Although I thought the book weakened towards the end (as if he was looking to fill a few more pages) it was a joy to read. Gavin made the history of a unique industry into a good story."
2,Artificial Hindi,"The language presented on the Pimsleur Hindi tapes is not ordinary spoken Hindi. It is an artificial Sanskritized version. These tapes will teach you many words that Hindi speakers will recognize but would not normally use in their own every-day conversation. Very disappointing. It seems as though someone took the transcript of the Pimsleur French or Spanish tapes and attempted a word-for-word translation into Hindi. Hindi speakers do not normally use separate words for 'please,' 'thank you,' and 'excuse me.' These sentiments are normally conveyed in Hindi through the use of verb endings, particles, etc. Hopefully Pimsleur will produce another set of Hindi lessons using 'real' Hindi sometime soon. I have used the Pimsleur tapes for Spanish and thought that they were excellent. I would like to see the Pimsleur method applied to a 'complete' Hindi course that uses normal spoken Hindi."
4,Could be better,"I have Pimsleur CDs for many different languages (Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and several others) and have found it very helpful for learning different Asian languages - however, this one for Hindi was not that good. There are certain sounds in Hindi that are much easier to pronounce correctly if you know where to place your tongue. In Pimsleur programs for other languages, this kind of helpful information is usually offered, but on recordings for Hindi it was not. I still consider these CDs a valuable addition, but out of several different programs that I purchased for learning Hindi, so far I have found Colloquial Hindi to be the most useful and Rosetta Stone Hindi has also been helpful."
2,Good for pronunciation - overly formal speaking,"I thought this was a good intro to Hindi but lacked much of the basics. For example, you only the learn the numbers 1-5 and then 8 and 9. Also, a little too much time is spent on pronunciation and not enough on content. In comparing what I've learned with Hindi speakers, they thought the conversations were overly formal and not completely realistic with awkward phrasing for colloquial use."
1,"""journalists should shut up or go to hell""","If you expected, like I did when I bought this ""product"", to be seeing AC/DC perform some legendary performances, you're gonna be very disappointed. The band is excellent, and while the sound is sometimes compromised, what annoyed the hell out of me was the various clowns who inadvertently interrupted these videos with their own wax and wane on the band's importance at that point. The result is, you get enticed into their playing, and then suddenly, the band becomes the background while these ""journalists"" sit on comfy couches and babble about the band. I say, ""shut up and let me see the band perform"". I don't need anybody telling me what they're doing while they're doing it. These people are as annoying as radio ""personalities""! VERY DISAPPOINTED. And it's funny, that throughout, not one band member talks, except for Brian who is interviewed in 1980. Cheezy."
4,Good for travel,"It says these are to be placed on your needles, but for the life of me I don't see how that's possible without breaking them. Maybe I'm just dense.Other than that, these are pretty handy for knitting on the go. They are small enough to fit in a pocket and stays on your number even when being jostled around in a purse."
3,not bad,The counters themselves are fine. My problem was on one of the cards there was only the yellow counter. Checked the box and still no red to be found.
4,Performs the desired function,"I've been knitting for more than ten years and had never used a stitch counter. I wish that I had discovered stitch counters sooner. They are so useful! Each of these particular counters can count up to 99 rows, or two sets of up to 9 rows. One is sized for a smaller needle and one for a large needle. This style of counter is ideal for knitting back and forth, either on straight or circular needles. If you used it for knitting in the round, I think you'd probably end up with a gap in your knitting."
1,Don't waste your money,"Numbers are very hard to read, almost like from a stamped impression and it was out of ink. Too cheap to bother sending back plus most of my purchases from Amazon have been awesome, so don't mind this cheap lemon."
3,Oh So Easy,"This game is so easy I beat it in only 3 days. I have Windows NT and I just popped the game in and it boom it worked, no installation, no nothing!!!!! All the other Humongous games did the same thing, it's very crazy. Well anyway if you just get stuck press F1 and click on solutions, that's what I did. It's still a pretty good game anyway."
1,Another one bits the dust,We have eagerly awaited this new Spy Fox game only to discover that Humongous as well as The Learning Company and others have stopped making software for the Macintosh. You would think with so many iMacs being sold that they would cut us a break. My kids are exremely dissapointed and so am I.
5,Wow wow wow..,"Our family LOVES Davidson's Tea. They have the nicest customer service, and their tea is absolutely delicious! Vanilla Cream Spice is one of our favorites. My friend came over yesterday and had some and could not believe how yummy it was! I recommend trying all of their teas."
2,a waste,"doesn't seem to be working at all for night sweats, and not sleeping.otherwise the product is packed well, and came in a good container."
4,Some side affects,I purchased this product based on reviews that were very helpful and the value of the product is the best I've seen. I have been taking them for 3 weeks now. I started with 2 a day and started having problems with gas. I went down to one a day with another supplement that I like and no meal with it and solved the gas problem that way. Soy is known for not agreeing with people so its not the brand. I would recomend this product because of the value for the money and it has helped tremendously with the hot flashes.
1,Did not do a thing,"Although the product packaging and quality appear perfectly fine, they did not work at all for me after two months."
1,can be bad news,hooked it up fried two hard drives called ultra yea they replaced the power supply but i was just screwed far as my hard drives being fried and thats what they told me too what if it fried somthing else well according to them they are not resposible for any hardware you might fry told me i should have tested it first well it does have a sticker saying it has ben tested so be carefull ive ben bulding systems since 1993 and this is the first time if ran acrross this sort of thing just glad it wasnt a customers system!!!!! call them and ask em
5,Great Psu,I highly recommend this product for any one who is building a Gaming computer. All the power you will ever need...!!
5,okay so i wrote one of the essays...,"Maybe Narducy of Evanston is kidding, but just to clarify for the kids in New York, Los Angeles, and Berlin--this IS the Jay Ryan based in Chicago, dude. And this book of his posters should grace the collection of any art student or indie music fan...ps. it would be great if Amazon would fix the typo in the title--it's ""Decade,"" not ""Secade."""
5,Zhou Yu - Master of the Chinese Erhu,"This disc is fantastic.I'm not analyzing very much what I am listening to, but just hear the end of ""Rivers of Blood"" and be in awe.There's a great instrumentalist here, the recording is very good (not perfect), the songs are rich in interesting forms, playing, and harmonies.Then you could say that it is classical Chinese music. That's what I got this album for, but now I listen to it simply because it is some excellent acoustic music."
4,A Good Book,One ofthe Good Books i've Come across the gambit Game.Both Decling & Accepting the Gambit & the Variation.A must read for a Good Player.
4,In a new tradition of fantasy,"Red Shift (Collins Voyager)and other Alan Garnertales share this strange English sort approach to 'magic' and the struggle between good and evil historically. The idea that some people aresomehow chosen at a very early age is also part of the Tibetan tradition.I found the acting pretty good, but the use of dark lighting again irritated me as it made it hard to distinguish details. The camera work was also very jerky and discontinuous,but overall I enjoyed the movie."
4,Magical,"I found this G rated movie to be fun, full of CGI and very entertaining. A very welcomed surprise for a movie that I'd heard nothing about, even when it was released."
4,Great movie!,"""The Seeker"" is part of a series of novels I LOVED as a child, and that my own children loved, too. The series introduces the reader to Old Magic, the magic and lore and religion of the Celts who inhabited Britain a LONG time ago! I actually re-read the series a few years ago, when I saw one of them in a bookstore. This movie does a terrific job of modernizing the setting and the people, but also of conveying the tone and events of the first book. I gave it to my family for Christmas, and they all LOVED it! Set at the Winter Solstice, it's a great winter movie to watch with your kids.If you love Harry Potter and Tolkien (the books and the movies), you will love this. I can't wait until the next one comes out!"
1,Dismal adaptation of a GREAT book,"We all had such high hope, didn't we? The fans of Susan Cooper's famous seriesThe Dark Is Rising (Boxed Set): The Dark Is Rising, Greenwitch, Over Sea, Under Stone, Silver on the Tree, The Grey Kinghad waited so long and when we heard Walden Media of Narnia fame was making the movie we were thrilled.Sigh. To get it made, Ms. Cooper signed away her rights to halt the massive, poorly concieved changes to this beloved novel. Not only was it 'updated' to appeal to tweens, substantial alterations added up to a movie no one really liked and were sad to see. Shame on Walden media for altering a classic in the name of marketing.Read the book and act as if this film never existed. You'll feel better."
1,Disappointing movie,"I discovered the Dark is Rising sequence nearly 21 years ago, and have read each of the five books hundreds of times. I hadn't remembered seeing the movie in theaters, so I was excited when the local Blockbuster had it to rent. Anyone who's seen the Harry Potter movies knows that you can skip parts of the plot and tell the same story, the Seeker doesn't even do that much. They've left out key pieces of plot, key developments, and a lot of the wonder of Susan Cooper's book. As a stand alone movie, if you've never read the books, it's just ok, as a lot of the story seems to wander. I was hugely disappointed with the movie, although the actors and effects were all pretty good. Anyone with children who want to read the book, I'd almost recommend that they watch the movie first, it would be less confusing."
2,disappointing,"After watching *Spiderwick Chronicles* and ""Golden Compass*, I thought I was in for a treat with *The Seeker*. Whoo, boy, was I wrong. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.Will, unknown unto himself, is destined to be a seeker, saving the world from darkness with light. The Old Ones, fearing that darkness is on the offense, make themselves known to Will and guide throught a ""crash course"" with the retrieval of six signs. These six signs will save the world from the dark force.And...that's pretty much it. Nothing really cool about it. Just. Plain. Boring.I haven't read the book. And by the majority of the reviews here, it looks like the movie has really deviated from the book...leaving fans sorely disappointed. Well, I didn't have to read the book to know that the movie was simply boring. The special effects was nice but they weren't enough to save the movie.You're not missing anything if you don't ever watch this film."
1,Disappointed & FURIOUS!!!,"As a huge fan of Susan Cooper's ""Dark is Rising"" series & a satisfied viewer of the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Narnia movies I was very excited to hear that they were going to adapt the ""dark is Rising"" to film.They shouldn't have bothered! This film is an offensive travesty with no resemblance to the book at all with the exception that the signs need to be collected. The casting of some little snotbag of an actor as Will is unforgivable along with all the other additions, subtractions & general 'creative liscence' that was taken.I wish I could give this movie no stars or better yet make it go away all together. Anyone who is a fan of Cooper's books will be sparing themselves some serious anger issues if they avoid this miserable piece of crap altogether."
2,"If I had read the book, I probably would have disliked this even more.","Susan Cooper's THE DARK IS RISING came highly recommended to me from a good (and very well read) friend about 10 years ago. I must confess I still have not read it. Some other friends convinced me to watch me to watch the movie though. I will let fans of the book make the call as to how well the movie follows the book. I've heard the two have very little in common, and I'm inclined to believe the report.In terms of imagery, one can tell where the movie borrows from such sources as HARRY POTTER, LORD OF THE RINGS, and to a large degree, even THE MATRIX. And although in certain points, THE SEEKER succeeds as a family-friendly and perhaps different kind of Christmas movie, it fails miserably in terms of poor writing, bad directing, and for the most part, poor acting.The experience of watching this film has not deterred me from reading the book."
3,The seeker should have found something else.,"Another poorly made movie adapted from a great book series. Instead of rewriting everything, just deal with what happens in the actual books. The actors are subpar especially Christopher Eccleston whom I really liked as the Doctor in the Doctor Who series. There never really seems to be any real danger for the lead character as he searches for the objects he needs to keep the Dark at bay. Better to keep with the Harry Potter movies than this."
3,The Seeker,"While there were a lot of interesting adaptations, some of the changes did not seem to serve the story. Will's move into the attic became a way to have his brothers pick on him instead of the treat that his brother Stephen provided for him. The brother who died before Stephen's birth became Will's twin who was stolen at birth. Other than that, I enjoyed how they tried to accomodate the book action to film."
1,TOTAL disappointment :(,"Having read the whole series, I found this book a TOTAL disappointment. It was like taking a line from every book and making a movie of it. It was truly terrible. Read the books! They are TOTALLY amazing!... and I am in my late 30's.. never too old for these books!"
1,Incoherent mess of a movie,"The book this movie is based on is an absolutely wonderful work of children's literature, probably one of the top 10 works of fantasy for children of all time. Couldn't the folks who made this movie have at least chosen some other (not good) book to base this movie on? This movie is a work of bad, not-fan fiction, by people, it appears, who did not bother to read the book first."
4,Give it a chance,"ok..i am betting most of these negative reviews didn't watch more than two or three episodes. Like most tv shows - it takes time to grow on you and this is one of those. Yes, they compressed a lot of stuff, over looked a lot, and seemed to be rushing it. But, as the series went on, it seemed to become closer to the books. I've read all the books so far and I can say that while it is not what I pictured - it is a viable depiction. For a TV show it does well and covers the topical points and powers with enough viability to make it worth watching. Yes, I pictured Richard and Catlin with more maturity but hey - I can go with the premise to attrack viewers. If it continues it will get better - Richard and Catlin have a long way to go and I enjoy the journey with them.Buy the dvd and get into it..it's worth it."
4,movie review,The movie The seeker: the dark is rising was very good. ALEXANDER lUDWIG WAS EXLEANTin the title roll
4,Not bad if you disassociate it from the book,"When I was a child my parents bought me the audio cassette version of The Dark Is Rising, and I spent hours listening to it over and over. I played them so much in fact that I wore the tapes out completely! When I heard that the movie had been made, I was ecstatic and couldn't wait to see it! Unfortunately, as others have said, the movie is definitely not the book.By itself, the movie is quite good. As for being a movie adaptation of the book, it's not even close. The only similarity between the movie and the book are many of the character names, and the concept of The Light versus The Dark. Beyond that, the movie and the book have absolutely nothing whatsoever in common with each other."
3,Not a movie to strain yourself seeking,I rented this DVD and allowed the replay to run it's normal course. I was not bored but the movie was not anything to shout about. Basically it is an adventure movie best enjoyed probably by Harry Porter fans. A seeker to return the power of the light? 'let there be dark' is a corny idea but certainly not novel!
2,Wish they had kept more of the book,"Having long been a fan of the Dark Is Rising book(s), I was really disappointed in this move adaptation. I understand the need to make a movie exciting, but and might have excused that, but the acting was so flat on top of the changes that seemed to lessen the story. I'm a fan of Christopher Eccelston and he just wasn't big enough in this movie, and I know he could have been wonderfully so. Also, the script did not do the character of Merriman Lyon justice. So basically, if you love the books, you'll be disappointed in this adaptation. But even as a standalone move it had several shortcomings."
4,great family movie,"Great family movie, fantastic special effects. A good puzzle of a story which keeps everyone glued to their seats watching intently."
2,sad to see a wonderful series end up on screen this way,"I sincerely hope Susan Cooper got a good deal on the rights to TDiR, as they've now sledge-hammered the spirit of one of my favorite series of books in the name of updating, relocating and modernizing...and ended up with a flop anyway.I can't really see how this would attract any of the audiences they were probably hoping would see it - the readers of the books will no doubt be disappointed and those who haven't read the books will have better-executed movies to choose from (see: Harry Potter, Spiderwick Chronicles, even The Golden Compass).To remove the story entirely from its lush UK settings and Arthurian plot devices is to deny child viewers a lot of credit that they honestly are due.Oh well."
1,Ruined a wonderful book,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am a huge fan of Ms. Coopers books and was excited to see a movie based on one of her books. Unfortunately, it was pretty much unwatchable. This review is on the first half of the movie, which I managed to force myself through. After that, I turned it off. From what I can see in the other reviews, that was a good choice.The movie has made unneccessary changes to the plot of the book. None of these changes improved upon the book; in fact, just the opposite is true. Further, the story was so condensed that it was almost impossible to follow. Special effects were over-the-top and completely distracting.I hope some day a good movie is made from the Dark is Rising series. Unfortunately, this is not it."
3,Not as bad as I was expecting,"Despite the horrible reviews I've read, I added this movie to my netflix list. As a bug fan of the Dark is Rising sequence, I knew there would be plenty of disappointing plot changes. For about the first 20 minutes, I continued to compare the book and movie and found the changes not necessary. Finally I decided to give the rest of the movie a fair chance and pretend the book and movie were totally unrelated. From that viewpoint, the movie isn't a total failure.Some of the acting was off, I was most disappointed with the character Merriman. I'd say this movie was average, certainly better than I expected."
3,A disapointment,"I had high hopes for this movie, the series by Susan Cooper on which the movie is based was a favorite of my as a child. While I realize the movie was only based on the book The Dark is Rising a bare nod was really made towards it. While that in of itself would not be to much of a problem if over all it had been entertaining, the movie really didn't flow well and was rather poorly done and uninteresting. While I have never before written a review this disappointing movie deserved a warning. I wouldn't buy this movie. Rent it if you must see it, but otherwise save your money. I give it 2 1/2 stars."
1,Why do they take good books and make them bad movies?,"The ""Dark is Rising"" books are excellent and well written...Why the movie people always seem to say ""well, we'll just take the names and the setting and see if we can't punch them up a bit"" when faced with great source material is beyond me! The movie isn't really even going to appeal to people who haven't read the books, as it seems very derivative at times. People who have read the series and are fans may develop violent feelings towards the screen play writers; I know we did! Just avoid this movie and perhaps ""they"" will consider it a bomb and not make another...."
3,Disappointed,"I had read the book serious by Susan Copper. Loved the books. Got the DVD, which did not cost a lot but was sadly disappointed in the movie and sadly disappointed in the purchase. The movie because it was not at all like the books, but then again movies usually aren't. The purchase because there was a rather large and significant skip in it which prevented me from viewing the whole thing. So next time be aware that sometimes you get what you pay for. Next time I will be purchasing a new DVD, not taking the risk that it will skip on me."
1,All too cliche,"First came Harry Potter, followed soon by the Narnia movies, Spiderwick Chronicles, The Golden Compass and a whole host of other fantasy movies starring white, English/American pre-adolescent children revolving around Good vs Evil. All have been based on successful books, and all have a built-in audience they cater too. Most of the movie adaptations have turned out good to great; but there is the occasional stinker, and this probably counts as the stinker of 2007. The movie has an all too simple plot; a boy discovers he has magical powers and learns to use them just in time to defeat an evil white guy on a horse. The boy is aided by a brotherhood of magicians; all white of course, with English accents too. The only authentic part of this movie is the fact that our boy hero saves his long-lost twin brother in the end. Everything else about this movie is too cliche. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
1,AAAHHHHHHHHHH!,"I watched the previews for this and decided I didn't want another disapointment, Like Blood & Chocolate was. I loved the classic book series, it is one of the best, right up there with Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Prydain, and the Chronicles of Narnia, but all I can say from what I saw is, ""AH, IT BURNS!"""
2,NOTHING like the books so don't hold your breath!,"Aside from some of the character names ...there is nothing to link this movie to the Susan Cooper series. At least with Harry Potter the storyline was somewhat followed - even if some things were left out.Having read ""The Dark Is Rising"" series, this movie was a sore disappointment to me. The books were fantastic, action-packed - hold on to your seats wonderful! The movie is a tiny shadow of the books. You find yourself being frustrated with Will and his teen whine and self-pity instead of hoping he finds the signs. Really important characters to the story were tossed to the wayside and some were left as a side-look instead of the real character. Sad disappointment of a movie. BUT, if you've never read the books - and you are a really young kid (or kid at heart) - you might enjoy this sad adaptation."
5,The Seeker,I found that the purchase was easy and I recieved the movie in a timely maner. I love the movie.
4,Don't read the book first!,"I really, really wish I had not read the book first. The single most boring, sleep inducing, confusing and silly book ever; the movie was definitely an improvement over the book. I only went to see the movie because Eccleston was in it, not enough, as it turns out, but I enjoyed the movie enough to recommend it to friends and see it again. I keep hearing it compared to the Harry Potter movies, as any movie with children-centered stories will be for quite some time to come, but I admit I didn't notice anything Potter-ish about it, except that it has a young boy as the lead. I recommend it."
5,"A great album, and seemingly, the only place to find, 'I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START' !!","Here is another nice Eddie Rabbitt album.This one was released in the middle of a string of number one hits in the early 80's.Three songs topped the charts from the album.The first two went to #1, and the third landed at the #2 spot.The b-sides of those three are also included in this great album.1. ""Step by step"", b/w ""My only wish"", 1981.2. ""Someone could lose a heart tonight"" b/w ""Nobody love me like my baby"", 1981.3. ""I don't know where to start"" b/w ""Skip-a-beat"", 1982.The first 2 hits are easily found, the problem arises if you would like the 3rd hit,which I do, but seems you can only find it on this one c.d.That may have something to do with the higher price!Well, for now I will keep listening to my vinyl, true it's not as handy,but it will do for now.This is good, easy listening country music."
5,Great Transaction,The seller was very involved and communicated to me more than any other seller when he/she really didn't have to. My son really enjoyed the jersey for a minimal price.
1,I Still Have Not Received This Shipment. This Is My Second Time Sending This Message.,I Still Have Not Received This Shipment. This Is My Second Time Sending This Message.
5,The best satire of the American public is found here,"Nothing is too sacred for it to be lampooned in Mad magazine, to the benefit of us all. Among others, in this book there are sections on:*) If corporations ran summer camps.*) If they had summer replacements in everyday life.*) If the U. S. government bought like the U. S. public buys.*) The lighter side of winter.*) Labor Day cards from management to labor.*) Mad's football roundup for little-known schools and colleges.There is no one better at writing satire of the American public than the staff writers of Mad. The best satire has a bite to it and that found in this book really bites. I laughed out loud at many of the jokes and I am sure you will as well."
5,Excelent Moonglow!!,"Excelent interpretation of lovely swing standard ""Moonglow"". Teddy Wilson shows a lirical approach to this theme and lets the arrangement be one of the best we can hear!!"
1,Second opinion - follow-up,"I first purchased a compact talking timer with its various sounds about 7 years ago and found it enormously helpful. When it finally needed replacement, I bought two new ones a month ago...one for the kitchen and one (pinned to my jacket) for reminding me for all sorts of follow-ups during the day. (ORIGINAL MODEL WAS ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL AND EASY TO USE....--- NEW ONES RECEIVED IN DECEMBER 2010 untrustworthy and almost useless- February 9 2011)THE TWO NEW ONES MUST BE DEFECTIVE BECAUSE THE TIMERS DO NOT ALWAYS START WHEN REQUESTED, OR WIPE OUT THE TIME INSTRUCTION AND I HAVE TO START OVER AGAIN IN THE ENTRY. NOT TRUSTWORTHY OPERATION."
4,I really like this timer/clock,"I use this in the shower to keep from using up too much water with a long shower. It's not waterproof, so I keep it away from the shower water. It has been working great at helping cut down my shower time. Not only does it show the current time, it has an alarm on the timer, and a timer that tracks your total time. In other words, a timer that counts up and another that counts down and they can both be on at the same time. The clock is small. The only drawback that I have found is the switch that goes from time to count down to count up is very small, which makes it hard to switch between them without going past the one you want."
1,IMPOSSIBLE,"I have a Master's Degree and could not figure out the diections! My 27 year old daughter couldn't either. Back in the box it went and I found a ""Pill Turtle"" that is awesome! Easy to set and my elderly mother can manage it. Don't buy this product unless you are an astro physicist or something like one in the brains dept."
1,I hate this talking timer,"I bought this for my elderly, diabetic mother to remind her to eat every 4 hours. This timer does not just chime every 4 hours as I wanted it to do...........oh no............it reminds you CONSTANTLY, like every few mintues that the scheduled time is approaching. Terribly irrating, in my opinion. I wasted [...] bucks. I put it back in the box and stuck it in a drawer."
4,upgrade photo,"Looks fantasti, really quick delivery but the down side was the photo needs to be upgraded cause its a lot thicker then it looks but looks fantastic."
4,Beats the heck out of Alkalines,"After going through my first 4-pack of alkaline batteries in my digital camera in only 1 day, I immediately looked into rechargables.I hadn't purchased any rechargables in a while, back when only NI-CADs were the only option. I was often a victim of the memory effect, which NI-MH completely eliminates.My camera has both an LCD display and a viewfinder, and the batteries will usually last about 2 or 3 days of picture taking unless I use the LCD monitor, which will reduce the longevity to about a day and a half.If you transfer your pictures directly from your camera instead of a card reader, your battery power will suffer a great deal.Overall, I'm satisfied with these batteries, but with today's higher-drain cameras, I'm sure there are other batteries that will hold a stronger and longer charge."
1,Why Bother?,"My bike was stolen right before my eyes. It took some junkie less than half a second to cut through the cable and ride away on MY custom built mountain bike. They claim it's cut resistant, but this lock resisted nothing. ...almost as if it wanted to be cut. If you're going to buy this lock then you better start saving for a new bike. Oh yeah, AND the combination mechanism is a total pain."
1,bad lock,"I bought two of these locks. The first one jammed after it fell on the ground (from about a 2.5 foot height); the second one jammed after I put it on, for no apparent reason, and I had to use bolt cutters to get it off. A cheaply made, faulty product in my opinion."
1,Stopped working after 3 days,"This lock stopped working correctly after only three days of use :( I used a lock by this same manufacturer for about 15 years without incident, but when I bought this one it failed to work properly after only three days... They just don't make 'em like them used to."
1,Junk,"This product did its job as described for a period of one year. After that the entire combination lock assembly fell apart into about 10 different pieces. It was then I learned that most of the assembly was made of plastic! This should have lasted longer. Save yourself the trouble and expense: go to the hardware store, buy a padlock and chain, and be done with it. It will probably cost the same as this thing, but will last for 10 years without falling apart."
1,Even the maker doesn't thinks it's any good!,"This cable was cut and my brand new bike stolen from in front of my house less than a week after buying it. Note that SOME Master Lock bicycle lock products offer an anti-theft guarantee...but NOT their cable locks! That should tell you something about what they themselves think about this product of theirs. See the locks that Master Lock recommends (and their anti-theft guarantee) here:[...]Lesson learned: don't cheap out on a bicycle lock, especially if you have a nice bike. Junkies WILL steal it because cable locks are so easy to cut, and expensive bikes are easy to sell for a quick $20 or $40 in cash. I would give this lock zero stars if I could!! Needless to say, when I replace my bike, I will not be buying this bike lock again, but will likely buy one that offers an anti-theft guarantee."
