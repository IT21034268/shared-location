2,Recycled Stooges,"New Shemp, Old Shemp, Fake Shemp.New Joe, Old Curly Stock Footage.For some fans, the DVD release of Columbia's final Three Stooges two-reelers is a cause for celebration. For others, the 1955-59 shorts are painful to sit through. Plenty of recycled footage, but not enough original material - guided by director Jules White at his heavy-handed worst. Moe, Larry, Shemp and Joe try their best to enliven the diminishing comedic returns and occasionally succeed. However, when ""Blunder Boys"" (an amusing ""Dragnet"" parody) emerges as the best film in the set, you realize that the Golden Age of Stoogery is long gone."
3,3 stooges dvd comedy,"I like the parts with Shemp, but when the new guy came in all of the comedy left due to very little if any slap stick.The new guy did not want Moe to hit on him, so that took away the REAL three stooges life style on screen."
5,Stooge Mania,"I am a huge fan of the Three Stooges, every episode is funny and a pleasure to watch with family and friends."
5,Amazing substrate for your aquarium,"There are many micro/macro nutrients in this substrate, so I don't need to add plant tabs for a long time (1-2 months). Plants that rely on roots to obtain its' nutrients will do well in these substrate. I have many amazon sword plants in my aquarium and they kept dying. After I changed the substrate, they stop turning yellow and their color recovered.Another pro is that the dark color makes the aquarium looks amazing. Fish have brighter colors, plants have brighter colors and it looks very natural."
5,"Looks great, can't beat it for freshwater plants","I use Eco-Complete in my 10 gallon freshwater tank. I have java ferns, wisteria, foxtail, anubias nana, and dwarf baby tears who have all taken off since being planted in this substrate. The dark color makes your tropical fish's colors really stand out. Would recommend this substrate to anyone who wants to start a planted tank. 20 pounds is enough for a 10 gallon. The fact that you don't have to wash this substrate is good too."
5,Great for plants/shrimps/fish,"I have about 30 lbs of this in my large tank and it works great. Plants love to root into it and shrimps and fish colors seem to pop more with the black background. I also think this helped me cycle my tank much quicker when i first installed it 2 years ago. Overall if you're looking for a black/dark substrate for live plants, this is a great way to go."
5,Excellent ... Best substrate out there.,"I bought 3 bags of the Eco Complete Black for a heavily planted 29 gallon tank. First of all, the substrate is a really nice brown and black color. It looks great in the tank. I was starting this tank from scratch. So I poured the Eco Complete in without washing it or rinsing it. Very little cloudiness which disappeared completely overnight after filtering it with a Emperor 400 filter. The water was crystal clear in about 2 days. I planted pygmy chain swords, Ludwigia, Brazilian swords and corkscrew Val. Everything grew like crazy with no CO2 and just small periodic feeding of Flourish plant foods. Eco Complete is a little expensive. But worth every penny."
5,best plant substrate ever,"I put this product in a full 55 gallon tank that contained fish plants and regular aquarium gravel.There was no mess or cloudy water at all!I just added it a section at a time in 2 day intervals,my plants and fish love it!"
4,been over a year and plants are doing great,"Tossed a bag of this in my 29g planted aquarium, haven't had an issue yet. I haven't had to add any extra plant food to my tank yet, they are all growing nicely. The fish, snails, and shrimp don't mind it either."
4,Not my favorite,"Like the title but is comes very close... the two downsides are that the 20 pounds counts the water weight since it comes pre-cycled and its not all black substate. If your okay with this, then this is for you!!!"
5,great stuff so far,"I got this from a different place but it's working great so far, it clouds your water up really badly, but with a good filter it clears up in about six hours or so. I will post a further result but I'm using fertilizer and have just one forty watt bulb thats just a full spectrum and about seven years old and need to be replaced obviously, though the plant's look great today three days into it."
4,"Good soil, but pre-rinse!","It took me about 4 to 5 bags of this for my 75 gallon to be able to put in my plants. Also says pre rinsed however I rinsed it thoroughly and still had cloudiness. Waited a while for it to settle, and then turned on my filters which cleared it right up. Only problem was the dirt and particles got trapped throughout the filter, so had to clean them out. Despite the cloudiness and cleaning the filters from it the soil works great and looks great as well."
3,different color than expected,My wife has purchased number 524 covergirl outlast before at stores and it was a different color.
2,"Nice looking case, until you put it on","This case looks good. The green is the perfect shade that I was looking for, and the swirls on the back look nice. But then you put it on, and it would look great if the back of the cover wouldn't stick to the back of the iPhone. It looks like you have massive air bubbles on the back of the phone, but no matter how hard you try (and believe me I tried) they will never go away because the edges of the case dont stick and the middle of the case does. Good concept, poorly executed here."
2,Not impressed,When I put this cover on my iPhone 4 it made the back of the phone look like it has water bubbles. I bought another case. The case is sturdy and the color is pretty but it doesn't work for me.
1,"Cheaply made, stay away!","I got this exact same case on EBay, for about 90% less. And the one on EBay was even constructed better. The cut-outs were all in line. I figured since this one cost more, the material would be 'better'? ""FALSE"" I ordered two of these from the same seller. Two different colors, and the materials, and the cutouts did not match. Save your money, go to EBay, and get a better much cheaper case than what is listed here. I have already emailed for an RMA on both cases."
3,Mind the size,"I usually wear a reliable size 39. When I received my order in that size, the shoes were so small that my feet could hardly fit in them. Determined to have these shoes, I ordered a size 41, which seemed to fit more like a 42, per a friend who's a size 40. So, being slightly stubburn, I made one last attempt and ordered a size 40. It was not a Cinderella fit as I had to have the shoes stretched for an additional $5. But now they finally fit and they're great!"
3,Beware of 20% restocking fee,"First, the shoe is well made & very stylish. However, I agree with the other reviewer. The shoe style/brand runs very small. I ALWAYS wear a size 11 (42 European) shoe. I could barely fit my foot into this shoe! I'm not willing to take a chance on another size because of the $11.00 shipping fee, no return label provided & the 20% restocking fee policy of One Chic Boutique. Give me a break! My shoes arrived in a box that didn't even have a cover."
4,The lost history of a forgotten First Lady,"This book,about the wife of Jefferson Davis-the President of an independent South, is an overlooked masterpiece of an overlooked heroine of the South. It is not the story of Magnolia and moonlight..but is the story of of the wife of a beleagured first lady to the President of a beleaguered and invaded nation at total war in the forlorn fight for independence.There are many commarisons to the spendthrift and mentally ill wife of The Invader, Abe Lincoln And Varina is by far the better woman. Varina's life is that of a true woman of strengh and courage both during the time of war and of defeat. This book deserves to be read by all those who claim feminism as their credo and they will learn what a woman of courage can do an be in a time that most living Americans cannot comprehend."
4,"good for a ""various artists"" album","The tracks on this CD are all by ""various artists"" so the thing lacks any ""consistency"" to it.However, several of the tracks are exceedingly good, and the rest of good also.It's all by female artists, and the styles really do vary a lot. But they are almost all of them of the ""Stevie Nicks Electronica"" type. HipHop to bass-groove type stuff. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole CD. However, my main focus in music is something to play while working. As I said, the styles and content are various enough that it can be distracting listening to it and trying to engage in some thoughtful work at the same time.Again, an Amazon recommended purchase which I am glad I did."
4,Good Trip Hop Album,"Due to the amount of gems on this album, I could only give it four stars. From the first song to fifth song you will be entranced with that wonderful trip-hop flow. After that the songs become bland and boring fillers. However, the first five songs are so great, it makes the album worth buying. The most beautiful song is Insensible by Mandalay, which combines beautiful instrumentals, intricate bass and beats and a lusty voice to make a for a pleasurable song. A perfect accompaniment of Hooverphonic. The sensuality and deep beats of the song Purple, and a vocalist that sounds like Fiona Apple is the perfect song for a rainy night. And the array of instruments and sounds of Creeper are just lovely. The deep trip-hop sound of Lusty reminds one of Massive Attack, also the sound of Uneasy, all shine with brilliance. These songs are defiantly worth the price of the CD. If you love trip-hop and electronic music, buy this. It has some of the best songs ever made."
2,Mediocre at best,"I personally couldn't get into this cd since I do love trip hop music. This compilation isn't terrible but it isn't what I consider to be good either. I really couldn't get into this cd. The songs just didn't flow together. I think this cd could have been better if Hooverphonic, Olive, Goldfrapp and Supreme Beings of Leisure were included on this comp and leave out Hybrid's ""I Know"" for example. I'm sorry I just couldn't enjoy this cd."
3,OK...but not special,"The reviewer is spot-on. The album starts of strong and loses its sense of purpose note even 1/2 way through....Pretty soon the tracks blend together in an overwhelming sense of blandness. Moreover, the compilation does not feature enough variation in the vocal styles available in trip-hop. But, in the end, even if the disc disappoints on several fronts, it still is quite pleasing to listen to."
5,Smooth and Sly,"I knew after the first song this CD was a winner. If you like Portishead and Soma Sonic your going to love ""She: A Female Trip-Hop Experience"". This is a CD that you can sit back and groove to, while sipping on a glass of Merlot. You will be grooven in your house, but you will be feeling like your in that upscale lounge. Don't hesitate, this is one for the collection!!!!"
5,excellent the collection of Mylene Farmer,"I love this collection . Its very beautiful big black box set with 4 disc into the coffin . Include 2 Cds in the concert ""avant Que L'ombre"" plus DVD in the concert and bonus DVD behind the stage . and the the booklet with extra picture in the concert .WOW - Oh my gosh, the sellers here charged too over price $681.51 for this . does it worth for that price ? LOL ... come on ... go for france ebay is much cheaper , . last 2 months i bought it at France ebay only $300 new and seal include shipped"
5,Similar to Lonesome Dove,"Really enjoyed the flavor of this book. You find yourself in a muddy tent city much like Lonesome Dove, the television series, which was surprisingly good and of course didn't last long. The mystery is interesting, although if one reads a lot of mysteries the who done it is pretty easy to figure. Anyway, this is still a good read because the author really does put the reader in this time period. Ms. Harris obviously did a lot of research. Hope we see all the characters again. (especially Chin and Mary)"
4,Great little press,This little speedball press is easy to use and gives good results. I didn't buy mine from this vendor but this looks like the best price around.
2,Speedball Block Printers Press: A toy!,"Speedball Block Printers Press did not live up to its promise. It feels more like a toy. I can get as good a result using a rolling pin. A waste of money, haven't been using it since trying it out when I first bought it."
4,Excellent - don't pass this one by,"This story is well told. A bit daunting to follow in the beginning, it is well worth it to stay with this story. Many paths that lead to one point are well written by Clemens. He leaves each section of the story in a suspense that pushed me to read onward, and onward, unable to easily put it down.The story itself reminds me of those stories told in Eragon and Lord of the Rings, with descriptions of scenes and emotions that put the reader in touch with the characters. Battles won, loved ones lost, and a single goal uniting all in their individual goals to protect the Wit'ch. (I happen to think that apostrophes are clever, actually)On to the next book!"
3,Stumbling out of the racing block.,"An easy book to read, and while the series' story seems promising, there are some annoyances. Mainly the racial naming convention of inserting apostrophes into known words. Wit'ch? Og're? Come on! I also find there's a bit of awkwardness to the characters and their conversation, but I hope this is due simply to the author having a final vision of what the characters will grow into, and is struggling with the metamorphosis."
3,Good at best...but dwindles on just ok.,"The characters seemed awkward and unreal in their personas. Their interaction to each other seemed even more so and unbelievable. The first half sucked me in but throughout the second half-I became less and less intrigued. Also there were too may inconsistancies and holes left by the author. On a more positive note though, the descriptiveness was great and the plot and the novel idea was golden."
3,Good. But not GREAT.,"Upon the sterling recommendation of amazon readers, I took the chance and read Wit'ch Fire last month. The first couple of chapters were awesome (making of the book, Greshym's search for the girl, blah, blah, blah), but thereafter, it took on a more ordinary turn. One thing I found bothersome about this story was the author's constant description of the character's feelings---not that this is a bad thing, but the overdoing of it (specifically in regards to Elena), kills the flow of the action and makes the character's look overly reflective. Now granted, the girl lost her parents, brother, found out she was a witch, all in the matter of 2 days, but her well-documented, emotional rollcoaster ride results in her looking whiney. By the end of the book, I had no desire to this follow this wimpy character into the apparently much-anticipated sequel. Sorry to ruin the 5 star average, folks."
2,Predictable Tropefest,A story only a Dungeon Master could love. The book strings together every D&D/fantasy trope one after the other in epically predictable fantasy story populated by hackneyed stereotypes. But if you like that sort of thing go for it.
3,Average,"This was an acceptable read, though the plot was somewhat formulaic. Seemed slightly trite at times, but it gave me my fantasy novel fix."
3,Interesting but series too long & drawm out,"Book One drew me in but as I slowly realized after reading all 5 books in the series, it became boring. Could have easily condensed the plot into 3 books. The author elaborates on the meaningless, drawing out each battle until you almost wish the main characters would just die and get it over with. Instead just when you think the author has painted himself into a corner they're saved by another character teleported at the last moment to save the band of characters, or by something else as simple as the common cold was in War of the Worlds. Could have been a great series, like Terry Brooks, but turned out to be just medicore."
3,Ok for a beginner,"Pretty much what you would expect from a guy who is in vet medicine and writing his first sci-fi novel. The whole novel covers only 2 days (the characters must have been very exhausted --all that happening and no sleep for 2 days??) but the characters are actually pretty interesting and the evil ones are pretty nasty. There were many inconsistencies and contradictions in this book, but by the second book, the writer seems to have found his groove and solidified his ideas. I do have to say that the cover art is hideous on all the books. . ."
1,Terrible Cliche Fantasy,"This book begins with a nice flair and moves at very quick pace until you arrive at 100-130 pages which reads much like an horror novel if anything before it unfortunately digresses into your garden variety fantasy fodder. No where near the works of great fantasy writers such as Hobb, Martin, and Tolkien. No comparision! First-off book contains very thin history- or world-building. An important aspect that great writers like Martin and Tolkien went to great pains to create. That's a big substantial zero in my book. Despite lacking this substance the novel also descends into shallow and unorginal clichedom, it reads too familiar. I am not going to pick up the second book."
4,A Magical Complexity,"Wit'ch Fire by James Clemens like most fantasy tales is pretty much the same story Bards were telling centuries before man could write. Over time storytellers have taken many different views of the witch story and added interesting and unusual threads to make their own tapestry of the tale. Clemens does this well. The story is his own and different from all other witch tales. There are a lot of characters because it is a big story with a lot going on. I had trouble at first keeping them all straight, but the challenge just added to the enjoyment of reading something that was so different. In essence this tale takes many of the old stories and ties them together with the characters that represent the old powers and the war between good and evil which is still fought today. What makes it special is the author has added things that never existed in the old stories and that gives his tale an unexpected newness."
3,Meh.,"Having read a lot of fantasy by a wide variety of authors, I found this book to be kind of a rehash of common fantasy elements and races. Nothing new to see, nothing unique or unexpected. It wasn't a bad novel, it was more just ... forgettable."
5,"Fast Paced full of Mystery and Magic, I want More...","For a first time Fantasy reader, I really liked the way the story started and ended. You could see Elena change during the story as you experienced with her the wonders of discovery. I was glued to the various characters as a terrible fate awaited them at the end of their journey. I couldn't envision how they would all meet and get out of the caverns alive, but they did and I couldn't stop reading until the late hours of the night. I can't wait for the journey to continue. My brother and son-in-law both enjoy fantasy, but this was my first book. I enjoy reading almost every type of book however, I think its time to read more like this if Witch Fire is an example of what I can expect. I had a great time sharing the adventure with the characters in the story. It was simply a lot of fun.p.s. I couldn't find any other books by James Clemens. Let me know if he writes any others, I would like to read anything he writes..."
4,four star fantasy = very good book,"If you like fantasy novels then this one is well worth the read. It's not perfect, nor the best book in the genre, but it does deliver on its promise, and while the characters aren't the deepest ever, you do find yourself pulling for them as battle the very bad bad guys. I will certainly be reading more of this series."
2,Okay book,I picked this up on fond remembrances and found it slow boring and somewhat clichéd. I regret buying it and the second second in the series. Moving on to other books
4,it was great!!!!,"i thought this book was one of the best books I ever read. it has action, excitement. it really paints a picture in your mind. I can't wait for the second book to come out. if your older you might not like this book but im 12 and i thought it was great."
1,Don't touch this if you aren't twelve years old.,"I got this book as a Christmas present, several years ago. When I finally got around to reading it, I was probably fourteen or fifteen. Even at that age, it came off as a children's book.By no stretch of imagination is this book worth reading. it's very poorly written, and more often than not, you're left wondering how the writer thought he could pull some parts of the novel off.I'll admit, I didn't even finish this book. It was slow torture. I could stomach the parts about Elena, but when I got to the story about the Ogre, and the one about the shapeshifter--I mean, it isn't that it was too outlandish for me; at the time, fantasy was all that I read. And I have read some very good fantasy novels.This just isn't one.Run away and don't look back."
2,Not the best,"While the story is complex and the fantasy/magic elements are plentiful I was extremely bored with the characterization. The best adjective I can come up with for the Elena and her band is ""pathetic"" and that applies singularily and in group. I think the villans would have been more interesting, but we don't really see them. It is tough to identify with so many pure victims."
2,Didn't even finish it,"I was about 3/5 from finishing this book when it became due at the library. I didn't even bother finishing it. Although the work has a few potentially interesting characters, it reads much like a gaming session of DnD yet not as fun. The plot is lackluster and unoriginal and the characters are artificial. This isn't a series worth beginning although I will give it that it's a quick read."
3,Cram it in - it seems to work.,"After reading multiple reviews online of the Wii Sling Bag, I was worried that it wouldn't be able to hold very much. After all, it looks pretty tiny. I was surprised to discover it actually fits quite a bit - you just have to cram it in there. I was able to pack in the Wii console, power brick, RCA cable, sensor bar, sensor bar stand, two Wii Remotes, two Nunchuk attachments, and one classic controller. I'm not lying.Placing the sensor bar vertically to the side of the Wii, and the power brick at the very bottom in front of the Wii seemed to give me plenty of space to cram everything else in. There's probably room to stick another remote or two, if you don't mind them pressing up against other objects, but it's certainly a tight squeeze.The inability to fit games or the Wii console's vertical stand in the bag is a big minus."
3,Not Enough Room,"I got the sling bag a few days ago and let me tell you, it cannot hold the Wii. It only has one pocket, and there are two mini-pockets inside. The back of the box says that it can hold the Wii System and accesories or something, but it can barely fit the Wii system, all the cords, and a Wii Remote. It wasn't even able to fit one game! I'm not sure if the cords were supposed to go in there, but believe me, ff I tried to fit anything else in there, it'd burst. If I'm using it wrong, (and I probably am,) it'd be awesome if you can give me some tips. I put the Wii system in there with the stand, then I put all the cords (sensor bar, AC Cables, adapter) in the big pocket. I then put a Wii-mote on top of it all. PLEASE, if anyone could help me out, that's be great. Thanks!"
3,Wii Sling bag,When I went to buy this item it showed a picture of an all white sling bag. But when I got the bag it ended up being mostly gray and I wanted the all white one. That was a disappointment.
1,"TOO SMALL, but perfect for PSP","FAR too small - don't believe a word about it being able to fit in all it's supposed to... but that being said, after my initial TOTAL disappointment, I realized it was PERFECT for my PSP and loads of games, instructn booklets (which fit well into main inside pocket, along with headphones - into little bitty pocket, charger and splitter). You might want a smaller interior case still, though, for your accessories, since there is a definite shortage of inside pockets.So don't give up on this case-- just do not consider for your Wii set-up. It's PERFECTLY PSP!!"
5,Nice and raw :),"This ep is very raw and freakin awesome! If you are a lover of metal, this ep is a must have."
5,Helpful Resource,WELL worth the money spent!!! This book is valuable and has great information for all ages and money saving tips. Buying one of each of my grown children. Keep on the book shelf.
2,Cheap Trick on Women,"While I really like the product, I resent the fact that they try to cheat us with this ridiculous trick. They must think all women are not very bright, and don't realize that the wide golden band at the bottom of the bottle just covers up the fact that the applicator does not reach past the golden band, while there is still plenty of the product left.They thought we wouldn't notice and think the product was empty when it was not. Don't they make enough profit on that little bottle already?"
1,Shoot smarter don't bother with this,"This is formula photography. Boring, uninformative , unimaginative. Save your money."
4,Wirklich toll!,"I moved to Nuernberg in 1986 and was exposed to this album through friends and fell in love with it. As the other reviewers have stated, understanding German will help listeners absorb the songs. I knew him only as a singer before Das Boot came out, and must say that I've not seen the entire film. Flugzeuge in meinem Bauch is one of my favorite mellow songs- there is so much emotion in his voice.Great album. Classic album."
5,A to-die-for hero!,"I simply adored this debut novel by Kate Rothwell--but I especially adored the hero, Mick. He was a very real, very sexy, very endearing character. Timona was a fascinating heroine, as well. She was an unusual mix of sophistication and sweetness, and different from most romance heroines. It was a terrific, fast-paced, sexy read, and I can't wait for Ms. Rothwell's next book!"
5,Excellent Debut...,"The characters are what really make this book. Timona is an intriguing mixture of adventurous and naive. You can't help but love her and cheer her on. The hero, Mick, is a strong, honest man forced into a dishonest job. Things relating to Timona provide him with the push he needs to leave it behind. Together they take a ragtag group to a better life and go on to face their own challenges and adventures in Minnesota.It is a sweet, heart-warming read. You owe it to yourself to give it a try."
3,maybe I'm getting picky...,"looks like I'm the one bone of contention here, but I didn't find this book as wonderful as the other reviewers. I kept getting the feeling that I should have liked this book. Some of the situations just struck me as too implausible for early America.While I liked the hero, Mick, at first, who was fairly honorable in every respect, I quickly took a dislike when he thought he'd ""have a go"" at the heroine because he thought she was a prostitute-in spite of her being injured AND the fact that he was almost bethothed to someone else. This one scene just threw me off the book, I'm afraid. That and the fact that, even though he's a cop, he still believes Timona is a prostitute through a third of the book? I quit at that point.Anyway-three stars for an interesting premise, maybe I'm wrong-try it for yourself, for $3.99 you can't lose."
3,Casca returns to the land of the Quetza,"This story begins with a fascinating passage where casca is a prisoner of the Inquisition and has to endure all sorts of torture. Worth reading over and over again. Later he travels to Cuba and joins Cortes and his expedition to the Aztecs, in the campaign of 1519.The book is well balanced between historical fact and the fiction of Casca's participation, and the final part where the conquistadors make their bid for freedom is full of tension and suspense. I particularly found the part where Casca returns to the place he visited centuries before compelling and memorable.Definitely worth a read and Casca fans will enjoy this one."
5,Excellent product,"Very nicely finished, appointed and packaged. Brand new condition, just as described and works perfectly in my bathroom! Highly recommend!"
1,useless dvd,"No idea if the music is good or not, as moviemars sent a dud dvd NOT playable in region 1"
3,"Good ""movie cowboy"" fiction","I enjoyed it as an introduction to the cowboy fiction most used by the movies of the forties and fifties - strong silent type, more at home with his horse than a woman, but hankering to settle down with the right woman. Stories are well paced.Hero is presented as almost superhuman in virtue and is always the best lightning fast shot anybody has ever seen, without having to practice. In order to have some suspense, as in the ending to Kilkenny, the author often has to set up unbelievably stupid behavior by the hero to put the villain in a power position."
3,Lots of large hook patterns,"If you like working with K-P hooks and 2 strands of yarn you'll be happy with many of the patterns in this book. They are designed to work up quickly. I don't care for using the jumbo hooks so am not thrilled with this collection...I suppose a pretty pattern can be adjusted for a smaller gauge using a smaller hook but I haven't bothered yet. Otherwise it's a nice book; good illustrations and the instructions appear to be thorough and simple enough for a novice, as a rule."
4,Great Patterns for Beginners as well as Advanced Crocheters,"Wonderful patterns for a variety of themes and styles. The book is divided into sections according to season, which is great to browse for ideas, but annoying when you are looking for a specific style of afghan. Does have two of the cutest baby/child afghans I have ever seen! One is Rainbow Diamonds, which is granny squares worked with side joining (I've made 10 thusfar) and A Child's Very Own which is done in rounds and looks great not only in primary but pastels (I've made 4 thusfar). I've made quite a few others and have found the patterns accurate and appealing when completed. Highly recommend!"
5,Great Afghan Book,This book has a wide variety of patterns that are easy to follow and easy to make.
3,poor documentation,"I have a copy as well. I ended up taking a class in 3-D to get up to speed. The manual that comes with the software is too dependant on the user already knowing 3-D terminology, etc."
4,The cure for the winter doldrums...,"This is wonderful, happy, good time music. If you don't feel instantly cheered up upon hearing songs like ""Mama Bird"" and ""Bang the Skillet"" you might want to check for a pulse!I only hesitate to give it five stars on the stength of ""Slow Time"" which was just a little bit better,but this album is still a must for any lover of ska music. Get it and shake off those winter doldrums!"
3,mediocre,these guys sound great live but somehow that live feel is missing in the cd. Over mixed on quite a few songs leading to a 2-dimensional sound stage. I have heard a lot better from a lot worse. Get a better producer and I think they will really stand out on their next release.
5,Very well done,"This commentary is one of my favorites. The scholarship is excellent, treatment is even-handed, and the writing style is fluid and easy to digest. I suppose the account of Israel's first kings makes for a particularly interesting study to begin with, but Bergen leads the reader through the text well. I highly recommend this book."
3,"Standard Conservative, Mid-Level Commentary . . . what one would expect from NAC","I purchased this text because it was required for a class. NAC is a mid-level commentary series, but I am typically interested in more scholarly works. I would say this commentary is well-suited for a non-specialist seeking a relatively informed commentary from a conservative position. Anyone looking for significant dialogue and interaction with scholarship at large (especially critical traditions) should look elsewhere. I would say that in light of commentaries as a whole, Bergen's is helpful in that he tends to be more sensitive to the literary structure of the book than most commentators (conservative, moderate and liberal)."
4,A Short History of Gaming,"This short book covers the history of gambling from Classic times down to the present. Gambling means wagering money on events which are beyond your control. (But sometimes the events can be controlled!) Gambling can encourage a reckless disregard for two precious commodities: time and money. As often as there is gambling, there are ways to fix the results. ""Don't bet on anything that talks"" is what some gamblers say. But the house figures the odds so they have the advantage.It is commonly believed that compulsive gamblers have an unconscious desire to lose. They also tend to be tense, irritable, suffer from insomnia, and think of suicide. They come from all levels of society and have many different backgrounds, but the overwhelming majority are men. Knowing that the odds are against them rarely stops people from gambling. Compulsive gamblers are a danger to themselves and to society."
2,"friendly advice, but some ignorance","The format of this book is appealing, but as with the other ""what to expect"" books there is bais toward our very new westernized approach to child care. It is not an opinion, but a fact that the AAP suggests breastfeeding past the first birthday due to the numorous benifits afforded both mother and baby. The author's DO show ignorance in promoting weaning by one year."
4,Excellent,"As always the ""What To Expect"" books have a great way of answering your questions while putting your mind at ease. I would recommend you have this whole series handy before you even have a baby."
1,Disappointed,"I should have taken into consideration the negative reviews on this book and taken them seriously. What a waste of money this product was in my opinion. I loved the book ""What to expect when you are expecting"" so I figured this book would provide the same enjoyment and was left disappointed. There's so much I didn't love about the book that all I can say is that there has to be something better out there and I will continue to look for it."
2,"OK, But ideas are outdated","I actually own the book ""What to expect the first year"" and thought it was fairly helpful. However, the more I get into this book, the more I think the ideas are antiquated and are in conflict with information now available on breastfeeding, sleeping, bottles, etc. I think the Dr. Sears book series is more helpful and identifies better with scientific and psychological evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding both babies and toddlers, attachment parenting, co-sleeping and avoiding the ""cry it out"" method. I also preferred the series of books ""Baby Hearts"" and ""The science of parenting""."
2,"another step down in the ""What to expect seires""","""What to expect when you are expecting"" was a good source of information and I could tolerate the writing style. ""What to expect the first year"" was less useful and I could just barely tolerate the writing. ""What to expect the toddler years"" I find impossible to read. I can summarize the book as follows: ""All toddlers are different. As long as you love them, you are doing your job as a parent. Don't worry about anything, they will grow out of it."" There, now you don't have to read it. If you just want to feel good, read this book. If you want real information and real advice, look elsewhere."
4,not as good as the first 2 but still pretty good,"The first two books in this series were never far from me during my pregnancy and my daughter's first year of life, but I use this one much less often. I think that is mostly due to the fact that I'm getting the hang of the whole mothering thing. I don't need to look up little things like how to change a diaper, but I do need it for big things like potty training or how to say ""no"" to my daughter without her laughing at me. The information is very good but the month to month organization that worked so well for the first two books doesn't translate so well to toddler development. Most of the things I've had issues with were nowhere near the month the issue was discussed in, so although I read the month to month chapters I usually have to resort to the index for questions. All the same, this is an excellent book and I don't think any new mother should be without it."
4,This new Edition is great!,"I was very happy to see that they added a chapter on the Special Needs child. I have a 3.5 year old son with Pervasive Development Disorder (PDD), and it is nice to see a book that deals with the entire child. My son has ""special needs that have to be dealt with, but he is also your average Toddler."
2,There are better resources out there,"This book is probably helpful for basic first-aid and illness care. But the negative stance on breastfeeding past age 1 irritated me. If I weren't so comfortable that I am doing the right thing by continuing to nurse my 14-month-old, this book would have made me guilt-ridden. For a series that tries to extoll the virtues of raising a healthy child through the right diet, this forced weaning attitude is a serious contradiction. American women need to be educated about the value of prolonged breastfeeding for their health and their babies' health. This book does the opposite."
2,"I never finished it, and I never look at it.","I read a bit of it.... to tell the truth you would be better off to but a years subscription to ""parants magazine"" or some other such...Most of the information will probably not be applicable to your child.. and you'll have many issues not addressed in the book. The questions/answer were to specific in nature to make the applicable unless you just happened to have the exact same problem. (unlike ""the first year"" when problems are usually more clinical, cut and dry)And, most of the ""advice"" is things you have hear 1,000 times anyway, or just common sense.The only thing that is moderately useful is the medical section, but the layout of the book makes it impractical in emergencies... there are much better suited books for this purpose out there."
1,"Easy to read, but not always scientifically accurate","The ""What to Expect"" books have become Gospel to pregnant women and new moms everywhere, but I take issue with some of the ""studies"" they generically refer to when citing what to most readers would seem like facts. Such as the claim that breastfeeding a child over the age of one has ""no nutritional benefits."" This is just plain false. Do the authors think the nutrients, immunoglobins and healthy cells contained in breastmilk just ""disappear"" after our toddlers' first birthday party? The book is ""dumbed down"" for easy digestibility, but I often think the facts are overlooked as a result.Also -- tackling issues such as physical affection with our toddlers in terms of what's appropriate and what's not appropriate is utterly ridiculous (one of the entries refers to kissing our babies on the lips). Who are they to say? It's almost creepy that they even try."
3,"Ok, but...","I haven't fully digested this book, but have tried a few of the recipies from the ""Best Odds Diet"" and so far they have all been awful! The sweet potato wedges turn out poorly, and the little pumpkin muffins are almost inedible--health food run amok. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for specific advice for feeding your toddler."
5,Practical and useful -- a must read,"Don't be put off by a few negative comments in these reader reviews. There is a reason this series is a national best seller. I have young twins and this book (and the entire series) has been simply invaluable. I use it as a starting point/reference, read a few other books that have different perspectives (I like Penelope Leach but think Dr. Sears is much too liberal for me) and then apply common sense. That is what parenting is all about, right?"
2,"Useful advice, but instils fear and uncertainty","I have both What to Expect in the Toddler Years and What to Expect in the First Year. While both books offer useful advice, too often the advice was fear-mongering and alarmist. ""If you do not do this for your child, he/she will do/become this..."" One ""sound"" bit of advice asserted that if your child cries as you head off to work, he is simply manipulating you. Often the advice is to push your child aggressively towards independence, a sentiment I found quite ""American.""I would balance these books with the level-headed advice of Penelope Leach's Your Baby and Child, or Martha Pieper's Smart Love."
2,Incredibly outdated,"Unfortunately, the first section I read of this book was the section on weaning. It left a pretty bad taste in my mouth, making it rather hard to enjoy the rest of the book. And for the non-believers, The American Academy of Pediatrics has this to say about nursing beyond one year of age:""Increased duration of breastfeeding confers significant health and developmental benefits for the child and the mother, especially in delaying return of fertility (thereby promoting optimal intervals between births)."""
1,OUTDATED!!,"This book is like 15 years out of date!!!! Maybe it's ""buyer beware"" - but I mad the assumption that this book is just as updated as ""What to Expect When You Are Expectating"" - and that is NOT the case!@"
4,Informative and Reassuring,"This is a very good book for any parent of a toddler. I have enjoyed all of the ""What to Expect"" books because they answer just about any question you can think of. I did feel that this one was a little opinionated, though on a couple of issues, such as extended breastfeeding and ""crying it out"". Overall I give it a very good rating."
5,Helpful book,"I do like this book alot. It has chapters by the months of age and milestones your child should be reaching and it also has special chapters on specific things like emergency and sickness. I don't listen to everything it says, but it is a good reference book on toddlers. I do recommend this book for parents with toddlers."
4,Pretty good so far,"So far this book is pretty good. I haven't had it long, but so far it's on target at where my 13 month old is at. Yes, I agree with the other reviewers about the advice on weaning your breastfed baby. I also breastfeed and plan on doing it for awhile, however the advice for people who want to wean is actually very good. Who says you have to do it now, do it when you are ready. Other than that, the book is pretty good."
3,Grandparents can say it better.,"Some of the ""rules"" in this book have been taken much too seriously by my son & daughter in law. We are now at a breaking point of when it is permissible to allow their 18 month old to ""visit"" his grandparents. They think he will be afraid if he wakes up in our home, he will be afraid if he's left with us for more than 4 hours... in all instances, they are afraid. I say, ""Be Afraid, be very afraid"" that this book has caused two intelligent human beings to become so neurotic we cannot communicate on the same level. What happened to ""family"" and grandparenting??? In this modern world, do we dare care for our grandchildren.??"
1,Good for a guilt trip,"While I did appriciate the medical reference guide. I thought that the authors were quite biased. The overall attitude of this book is 'if you don't do it the way we do it then you're doing it wrong'The book gives reasons that have no medical basis as to why a mother must wean by 1 year. Anything other than letting your baby cry it out is seen as 'cowardly' and co-sleeping is completely looked down upon and discouraged.I found this book to be insulting, as if by following my insincts I was actually harming my child."
2,Not as good as we'd hoped,"Definately doesn't live up to What to Expect the First Years. Somethings are written very vaguely, if at all. Recently we were looking up hives - nothing!!!! Just a blurb. Sorry Arlene Eisenberg, you need to take your time with these books and include everything before you just send it to the presses."
1,save your money.,"I really regret this purchase. I had the pregnancy one, and found it to be reassuring. I never got around to buying the first year one, and instead picked this one up. I knew from the beginning when they were basically discouraging breastfeeding that it was a mistake. I am not completely into attachment parenting, some of it works for us, some doesn't, but if you are then this book is not for you. There was really nothing that gave me an ""ah ha"" moment. It was all either common sense or contradictory, as other reviewers mentioned. I have found much more practical info on [...], or just my own trial and error and gut instincts. It ""felt wrong"" to let dd cry it out, so I just didn't. Check out Dr Sears instead and remember, you know your own baby better than anyone."
5,A lot of userful advice,"We turn to a lot of books for helping in raising our daughter (now 2 and a half) and the various issues we face. ""What to Expect the Toddler Years"" is among our top three, along with Penelope Leach's ""Your Baby & Child"" and the American Academedy of Pediatrics's ""Caring for your Baby and Child"". The advice of the three is quite consistent (including on such ""hot button issues"" as when to wean), but this What to Expect Book provides the greatest help on day-to-day stuff. The philosophy is consistently respectful of the child, and the book is full of useful advice."
1,What to expect from this book? Garbage!,"The authors' tone is that of know-it-alls, yet, I see their credentials nowhere in the book! Hmmm...maybe, they have none!?The information given is simply their opinion presented as facts.The question/answer format is maddening and redundant.I stopped reading the book when I got to the section on why you MUST wean at 1 year old. Their reasons (read:opinions) are not based on any scientific data or research, and they go against what the American Academy of Pediatrics and all other medical organizations in the world recommend.Why an educated parent would want to get his/her info from a source as this obviously ignorant pair of women is beyond me...If publishers didn't just care about money, they wouldn't let this kind of garbage be printed.My copy of this book was picked up with th erecycling yesterday. Good riddance."
1,Obtuse and Unobtrusive,"I was unimpressed and also left quite uniformed on several issues concerning me. A lot of words here, the authors seem quite verbose, but the words ring empty. I would say I found it difficult to find anything I wanted to locate in this work. In all actuality there was truly nothing of substance to find. Metaphorically I was left empty handed."
4,"The Toddler ""Bible""","This book is the Toddler ""Bible"". Anything and everything you ever wanted to know about what your toddler is or may be experiencing is right here in this book. You come off looking like a pro when you need to explain to your significant other why you child is acting the way he/she is or feeling the way he/she is feeling. Love the book..can't put it down, can't say enough good things about it. I always have it with me."
2,"Too old, out-of-date?","I almost ordered this book but good thing I realized that this book was published in 1994, almost 13 years ago! Toddler care and education have advanced a lot since then, so I'm going to buy a book that's more up-to-date."
5,Received in great condition,I purchased this book as a gift for my sister whom is expecting. She is currently reading the first book in this series and I thought this may be helpful for her in the future.
1,"Just the facts, please","I've grown to dread reading this book. It's a thousand pages and should be a hundred. Does any tired toddler mommy really have time to sift through pages and pages of preachy, way-too-earnest commentary? This one doesn't! Please, just give me the facts, preferably in bullet points. And hey, maybe even throw in a tiny bit of humor. That's what Mommy needs after a day of tantrums. Ha!"
3,Glib and Superficial,"I was disappointed in this book. I leafed through it at a friend of mine's house and came across this advice on tantrums: Basically, wait until they calm down and then EXPLAIN to the toddler why they couldn't be gratified. They will listen and be interested.My friend and I laughed our heads off at this. She bought this book because her three year old is pitching riotous fits and she was looking for some advice to help with the calming down phase."
3,Should show the real cover of the book they're selling,"It is the book i wanted to read, but the edition they sent is not the one showed in the picture, i sure wanted to see the updates and that is why i didnt purchase of the adds with the old cover..."
2,"Author's personal opinions stated as ""fact"" - not helpful","I received this as a gift and was really excited to read it, as I enjoy learning about child development, but I quickly became frustrated with this book and refuse to read any more of it. The author gives many opinions about child development and ""proper parenting"" that are nothing more than her opinion or personal feeling and are not in agreement with other reliable sources of information. My biggest concern is the mis-information that she gives about breastfeeding, stating that it does not have any nutritional benefit after one year of age and suggesting that there is something wrong with continuing to breastfeed past one year. This simply isn't true and certainly should not be presented as anything more than her personal feelings on the matter. This completely discredited the book for me."
4,A Grandmother's Opinion,"It's been a while since I had a toddler, but my grandchild spends quite a bit of time with me, so I decided I needed a little guidance. This book has been a great resource to help me and my son figure out if our expectations are reasonable, and what to expect as my grandchild matures. It is not a manual on how to raise a child, but simply a guide to help with the many questions that arise as you are doing so. It is a good book for first-time parents, and for those who just need to brush up--and for grandparents who are doing their very best to spoil their grandchildren and drive the parents crazy. Turn about is fair play!"
5,must read,I am a first time mommy and I have been given lots of advise from family and friends. I have read all the book in this series and have to say that these books have the answers to almost all my questions.
2,I agree with the nursing mom..,"Some of the book is ok but the information on breastfeeding seemed to be more the author's opinion and not fact. If you are going to get this book I would suggest taking the information in that section with a grain of salt! For more accurate breastfeeding and weaning information read something by Dr. William Sears, visit the La Leche League website, and/or contact a LLL leader in your area."
4,Easy to read & find info,"If you are going to buy a general book on raising toddlers, then consider this book. As a mom of 2, this series of books is the only one that I have kept, recommended and loaned out constantly.The format and writing style is easy to read and understand. It's easy to scan to find what you need. Although you may not share similar opinions on every child rearing subject, it's interesting to read the author's notes on what they feel works. But I did not feel pressured to choose one way or the other.So whether you buy, rent or borrow... this book is worth checking out. And I always think this book, along with What to Expect make great gifts for pregnant moms."
2,Needs to be updated,"This book has the same format as the other ""What to Expect"" books, but some of the information is out of date. This is not a book to read if you are breastfeeding, or if you are practicing any version of attachment parenting. The breastfeeding section quotes studies that have since been proven wrong, and will make you feel guilty for breastfeeding your child past their first birthday. I returned this book, and am looking for a more up to date toddler reference."
5,Love this book!,"I LOVE the what-to-expect series. I have the prior two books, and it puts my mind at ease to have advice for each stage. LOVE it!"
3,"Lots of information, but poorly organized","Readers who are familiar with What to Expect when You are Expecting and ...The First Year will be familiar with the authors' style and provision of useful answers to simple but important questions parents have. However, I found the format of the book--sections organized by the child's age AND by special topic (e.g. toilet training)--pretty disorganized."
1,"Too much preaching, not enough useful advice","Although I found the ""milestone"" sections of this book to be helpful, I wasn't a fan of the rest of the book. Even if you can get past the condescending, self-righteous tone of the author, I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know. Not only that, some of the ""advice"" is more or less the author's opinion. For example, the author obviously isn't a fan of nursing past the age of 12 months. While I'm not a breastfeeding Nazi by any means, I just feel that child development books should state helpful facts, not an author's biased opinion."
3,"Not the worst book I've read, but...","As a nursing mom I found their advice about weaning to be more inline for a bottlefed baby. Thank goodness for La Leche League and the sound, sensible, proven information I got from them and their book. I hope all nursing mom's talk to a La Leche League member, or read ""The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding"" before following Eisenberg's instructions for when and how to wean a breastfed baby."
2,it's okay,"I have the whole 'series' and while I found the pregnancy and 1st year books helpful, I hardly ever used this book. The month by month format is helpful for babies/pregnancy, but toddlers don't really change month by month as drastically, so I disliked the organization. I agree with another reviewer that there is a bias/agenda to wean by 1 year and if you are into attachment parenting, this book doesn't fall in line with that at all. I just find it too broad and it hardly ever gave me the answers I wanted."
1,"bad advice on discipline, tantrums and behavior","This book does an ok job of covering the medical and developmental topics, but let's face it: most questions we all have about toddlers involve behavior! I followed their advice for 6 months, and in retrospect feel that they too frequently make parents feel that we risk harming our toddlers self esteem by setting firm boundaries. In general, I feel their philosophy is too wimpy. They even say that some kids are just unhappy/grumpy by nature and that you can't do anything about it. I strongly disagree, and after purchasing a few more parenting books, feel that my son is so much happier, communicates with me better, and I enjoy being a mother so much more! There are no right/wrong answers to parenting toddlers, but this book is way too wimpy and submissive when addressing very little people with big opinions."
3,not so impressed,"I had to contact the seller and ""remind"" him that I ordered the book~ it took almost a month to finally arrive~"
4,What to Expect the Toddler Years,The book was received in a timely manner and it was in good condition.
3,I could definetely relate,"This book is about a girl who starts to crush on one of her brother's friends, a big no-no according to her brother. I coul really relate to this story because i have an older brother, and it helped me to identify with the characters. I would recommend it for any romantic. It is a good book."
5,AWESOME,I have read over half of the books in this series and this one is still by far the best i wish they would get this author to write some more books for the series.
3,Tilt,"I would have preferred the scale to be in degrees of tilt. Instead, it is in inches of correction at the low corner of the trailer. Perhaps this is useful to some, but not what I had expected (photos were too small to see scale numbers). Otherwise, the levels are nice, and easy to read."
2,Not as expected,"It was not what I ""thought"" the product should have been. It is too small for me to read at any distance....anyway, no hassle return."
4,Hipkins Levels,Nice but no instructions received for installation. Also unsure of proper mounting area within the motorhome for best effect. Once I figure it out I'm sure they will be great.
4,Simple solution for RV,"Easy to install, peel and stick. Inexpensive solution for our RV.Been installed for over a year now, no problem.As always shipping with Amazon Prime was super fast."
5,trailer level guide,these were exact rplacements for the trailer the liquid in the old ones turned clear new ones have green colored liquid you can see the bubble
5,Neat,"Arrived promptly. Simple design, attach them all over the place. What you see is what you get, no surprises."
4,RV level gauge,"These are a great help when leveling the RV from the the jack controller. Like any other Level, bumping could move them out of position and off level if not screwed to the RV."
3,Little small,"I bought these to put on the corner of my trailer to help with finding a level spot before setting up camp but they a little small against my travel trailer. I guess instead of digging out the level in the drawer it is a quick look to try to level the trailer. I may have to adjust the levels, because they show the trailer is not level when it lloks pretty level to the eyesight."
3,It does what it is supposed to do!,These levels work like a charm. Unfortunately the design hasn't changed since I was a boy. They would look right at home on a 70's or 80's trailer but stick out like a sore thumb on my 2011 hard wall trailer.They do the job at a reasonable price. The double sided tape seems to be secure enough. I'm always happy to avoid drilling holes in things that live outside.
5,You NEED this.,"If your trailer has none of these levels, you need these! Easy to just peel and stick. Takes minutes and saves you lots of time setting up the trailer."
4,Keeping it level,"You get two levels, one for side to side and one for front to back. Each level is calibrated to help you adjust to reach level and a printed guide as to how much to raise or lower the unit and where. Once you have made sure the unit is level you have only to stick on the guides and from then on you need only glance at the bubble to know how close your unit is to being level. They both are easy to read and seem to weather well and are good quality for the money."
5,AWESOME!!,"I bought this for my husband so he wouldn't be jarred awake by his regular alarm anymore. He LOVES it, and he's very hard to please. I'm ordering one for myself now."
5,Love this Clock Radio!,"This is the best alarm clock ever! It looks very cool and has many great features including dual alarm, nap button, variable snooze setting, and built in night light. It also has a very decent AM/FM radio. My favorite feature is the gradual alarm which gently wakes you up. It starts out as a soft chirp and gradually increases to a loud beep. I used to hate waking up by a sudden loud alarm which always left my heart pounding. I highly recommend this clock radio."
5,THE BEST STUFF THERE IS!!!,"AFTER FALLING IN LOVE WITH ""O, BROTHER"" AND THE SOUNDTRACK CD, I COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE RELEASE OF THE CONCERT FILM!!! IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT! THE MUSIC IS SPECTACULAR-MOST IS FROM THE FILM, WITH SOME WONDERFUL ADDITIONS!!! CHRIS THOMAS KING IS FANTASTIC!THE BACKSTAGE FOOTAGE IS SWEET, FUNNY AND VERY ENJOYABLE! SEEING JOHN HARTFORD AT THE END OF HIS LIFE MAKES THIS EVEN MORE SPECIAL! THE WHITES, THE FAIRFIELD FOUR (UNBELIEVEABLE),EMMY LOU, ALLISON KRAUSE AND THE INCOMPARABLE RALPH STANLEY MAKE THIS A MUST-OWN FOR LOVERS OF ROOTS MUSIC!"
3,"Great music, frustrating access","The music is great, but there isn't a searchable song menu and there's a lot of backstage stuff that should have been put in the ""bonus features."" Why not start with ""Introduction"" then have each song in the concert as individual accessible chapter? Very disappointing."
4,Diamond in the rough,"This was the concert of the ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" sound track. It has some great performances, less the famous ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", which is a real disappointment. But you get some excellent glimpses into the origins of Bluegrass music as well as some great performances from current and upcoming stars of this genre. A definite must for collectors."
2,Dlivery Disappointment,"I chose this rating because it is currently 02 Feb, it was estimated that the delivery date was 31 Jan and it still is in transit. The person I sent it to was to have a special surprise on her special day and that will not happen. Next time lets have a liottle honesty when you estimate package arrivals. Anyone can say it will be there in a couple of weeks. very disappointed, Have still to receive the product."
3,For Fans Only,"When a recording is named for its principals--no other title--you can bet that it is considered some kind of landmark. So it is with this 1958 recording that featured Kenny Burrell on guitar and John Coltrane on tenor sax, backed up by Tommy Flanagan on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums. Quite a roster! To these ears, however, Burrell's guitar never takes off and Coltrane seems to be just sort of noodling around about half the time. Overall, I find this recording quite forgettable, but I am well aware that mine is a minority view, and that many jazz fans will be completely delighted to learn that JVC has made this recording available in XRCD format. To them, I recommend it highly."
1,wrong color,I would have returned had I not brought the brand new tube with me to mexico before noticing that it is brown instead of black as labeled. It also seemed dry compared to every other max factor mascara (including other tubes of lashfinity that i have had).
2,"""HTTP: The Definitive Guide"" is a better deal","I bought the ""HTTP Developer's Handbook"" and read it in about 2 days. I just didn't see a lot of developer information in the book. Then I bought ""HTTP: The Definitive Guide"" for less money and realized it has lots more information in it. Sorry Chris Shiflett, as much as I liked your PHP security book, your HTTP book needs an upgrade."
4,Excellent overview of HTTP,"This is a short book in comparison to some others, but the author does provide numerous experience-based insights into best practices, some of which are not at all the obvious thing to do. In general, the book does a good job of preparing the reader for using and understanding HTTP in the real world."
5,An excellent introduction to HTTP,"Perfect for a web developer that has never previously put in the time to learn the fundamentals of HTTP. I read this entire book in a weekend, and it was time well spent."
5,Great all-in-one product,"Great all-in-one product, easy to install and use. First Laser cartridge doesnt last too long, but a refil at cartridge world lasts forever"
4,nice fast in home office printer,"This printer seems to work well. If I am printeing in bulk (>20 pages) is has gotten jammed. But this is not the inteneded use for this printer. Also, I am not sure how to turn the fax option off, other than disconnecting the phone line."
5,Cannon MF4150 Review,"The MF4150 is one of the best investments that I have made. It does everything great at an economical price. The copying, the scanning, the fax, and the printing performance was as advertised. Would recommend it to anyone."
2,No Scanner Support for OSX,"Title about says it all. You can use the scanner without having a driver, which it turn isn't compatible with OSX.The rest of the machine works OK, but alas, I can't scan. They shouldn't be able to say they are compatible with a specific OS unless they are 100%, or a disclaimer at least."
1,BAIT AND SWITCH MF4150 & MAC,"After several hours of reading, installing, and trial and error, I am unable to connect my MacBook Pro to the Canon MF 4150 via airport. In my opinion, this product should NOT have the MAC compatible symbol on the box if it is not completely compitable. The downloaded drivers give me continuous error messages for both FAX and PRINT. The no recipients message is given every time I try to print. Fax is not even an option at this point. I do not recommend.I did read the side of the box prior to purchase that the Canon stated that it had limited functionality of only fax and print (this was all I needed). Yet, it still did not work. I'm going back to my Samsung ML2550 printer (worked out of the box) and I'll buy a separate copy machine and fax machine by companies other than Canon.I will NEVER buy another Canon in my life for any of my businesses."
5,Very good,This is perfect for what I needed. Scanning and printing are both acceptably fast compared with the old separate printer and scanner I replaced this with. Output looks very good for an all-in-one in this price range.
5,Ahead of the game,Our office just went paperless and I finaly could get rid of the huge copier we were paying a monthly fee for. This machine meets all our needs for copying now as well as faxing.It was simple plug and play for these functions and has worked great so far. I feel I am ahead of the game since the purchase price of this machine is less than one month's lease payment on our previous copier. I highly recommend the mf4150.
1,Useless if you've got a Mac,"I bought one of these about a year ago. It worked great on our wifi network with our windows notebooks. We've now switched to Macs and found the printer is now complete junk. It just about prints with a direct USB connection, but scanning is not supported and neither is printing via airport.C'mon Canon how about some love for Mac users?"
1,Cannon scanner does not work,"The technical service support need a lot to be desired. I had to change a toner cartridge and it took me three phone calls to get it right. The memory inside the cartridge had to erased out, and this was done by turning the power on and off at least 10 times. I never tried the scanner before until yesterday, and even after few phone calls I am not able to get it working. The technical service people need lot of training. I would not recommend this product to anyone"
2,Terrible Mac OS Support!,"This unit has all of the features that I wanted: scanner, document feeder, and duplex printing. Canon also has a reputation for good mac support. However, this printer has terrible Mac OS X support.It comes with a USB 2.0 printer driver for OS X that works well with single sided printing, however there is no way to send two-sided print jobs. I know that the duplexer inside the printer works (I can make two-sided copies), but Canon's Mac software doesn't support two-sided printing. How hard can that be.Second, there is no scanning software for this Canon unit. None at all. How hard could it be to include a TWAIN driver or some basic scan-to-tiff or scan-to-pdf support?Finally, I could not get any news from Canon's customer support about when, or even if, their engineers were planning to support these features on their OS X driver. It would be nice to have some news on this front, and maybe to get on a beta test list.Agh."
3,Incorrect list price,"List price on this printer is $249 not $695. Amazon's selling price is still a good deal, but not quite as good as this listing makes it appear."
2,Two problems leading me to return it,"I really like this printer in theory -- but am returning it, for two reasons. First, the good: it prints well, and does everything it says it will do well, is nicely designed, etc.Now, the bad.First, it won't work with an Airport Express print router (even just as a printer). The Brother MFC I need to replace would do so, and I guess I'm going to have to go back to Brother. (I didn't expect it to allow scanning wirelessly -- that entails data upstream rather than downstream -- but printing it should have been able to do. I've confirmed with Canon, however, that it will not work.)Second, as others have said, I cannot get it to print duplex on a Mac. (It will duplex from my WinXP computer, but not from my Mac.) Really frustrating, as the Mac print driver has an option for duplex printing -- but it is always grayed out."
5,Great printer,Great laser printer. Paper never jams. had great luck with canon's ink jet and laser seems just as reliable. great price too
4,VERY GOOD PRODUCT,"The MF4150 arrived ahead of projected delivery date. Quick and easy set up. Provides the multifunctions, prints rapidly. Well worth the money."
3,"Good all-in-one, but no scanner driver for macs","I got this printer quite a while ago.Duplex printing works great: even though it is not as fast as some would like, I think it pretty good for a printer at this price-range.Only reason it is not getting five stars is because there is no way I can get the scanner to work with my Mac. Apparently, there is no scanner driver for Macs and Canon does not seem interested in making one available. If I did not have my stone age era Windows machine still with me, I would not have been able to use it...CANON: I LOVE YOUR ALL-IN-ONE AND I HATE YOU FOR NOT SUPPORTING IT FOR MACS!!!"
1,Do NOT buy this printer!,"Sure, this product works just great... until it breaks!!! I bought this printer because it was an editor's choice from PC Magazine, but obviously, they didn't use the printer for more than 30 days. Mine malfunctioned in less than 90 days. Just do a search on the internet for ""Toner Is Not Set, Insert Toner"" and see some other people's experience. After 90 days, Amazon won't replace/refund, and the nearest Canon repair center is over 100 miles away. The worst part is I spent almost $100 on a new toner cartridge because I believed the error message. Horrible Product!"
5,Cannon multifunction laser,"I have used the fax, print and copy functions, but not the scan function. The performance is great, especially the ability to copy 2-sided. Speed is good and print quality is high. This product uses black ink only. This is one of the main benefits to me since I do not print in color and did not want to mess with color cartridges. However, according to the literature, you can scan in color. One inconvenience is that the provided guide covers only the basic uses. For other uses, you have to refer to the guide that becomes installed on your PC when you run the installation CD. I had to use this guide when copying 2-sided."
1,toner runs out almost immediately,"If you don't mind spending $80 on toner every thousand pages, this is the machine for you. I get 1200 pages at most before I have to go out and buy another toner cartridge. I've had this printer for two months, and already I'm looking for another."
2,Works great--as long as you don't use a Mac,"Canon's support for the Mac OS X platform is horrendous. First, they have NEVER supported scanning on a Mac with this machine. The driver has always been crippled in that respect. Then, it took them 2-3 months to get a crippled Snow Leopard driver out and it *barely* worked. You had to print 1 page at a time and could not duplex print. Then they finally released v2.05 of the driver and printing was OK but you could no longer share the printer out to other computers (either Mac or Windows). They COMPLETELY bungled the Snow Leopard driver. I'm still waiting for a full-featured (I NEED TO SHARE THIS PRINTER!) driver to come out. It shared fine under Leopard but if you install the latest driver under Leopard or Snow Leopard it will not share out. [...]"
2,"If you have a Mac, move along - nothing to print/scan/fax here","I'm a big fan of Canon cameras, lenses and even their printers. I bought this multifunction unit to give me the print/scan/fax functionality. Unfortunately, it is not possible to get any of these features to work consistently from an Apple manufactured computer. Not on Mac OS X, not on Windows 7 through Boot Camp at least. If you have a Mac, do not buy this printer. I have spent many hours looking for work arounds and drivers, but the printer is getting older and it doesn't look like Canon or Apple (or whoever is responsible for the difficulties) will ever write the drivers for this to work. I've had it for about two years and it's never really worked consistently.While I can generally print a page or two from Mac OS X, eventually, its back to non-functioning status. If you have a wife or kids who want to print anything - this is not the printer your looking for. Don't get me started on faxing or scanning."
1,NOT FULLY MAC COMPATIBLE,"The printing and copying functions work fine, but there is NO SCANNER DRIVER FOR MAC. Unfortunately, I used the machine before I discovered this. I regret buying it, because I need the scanning function and simply don't have it. I spoke with Canon customer service and emailed them and they don't seem particularly concerned about this problem. If you're a mac user -- be forewarned! -- don't buy this product."
4,Superb and happy so far...,"I concur with the majority that I have had great success so far. I only rate 4 instead of 5 because a) I have not successfully scanned a doc into a Word.doc yet - and I hope to be able to do that, and b) I have not actually used the duplex function BUT I trust that it works based on other feedback.re: L Simon's concern with fax and extension phoneI am not sure whether I have this same set up BUT I have never had this problem. My phone attaches to the Printer and the Printer attaches to the wall. I believe this is the correct way to set it up. I have a tri-function RF45 Jack and my computer modem (which I don't use) attaches separately. I have had no problems in this regard."
3,great machine Bad toner indicator,"This is a great machine except for two things. The toner out light will come on almost all the time unless it is a brand new cartridge. For example you put a new catridge in and one week later it says ""out of toner change toner"" when in fact there is plenty of toner. Sometimes you will have to shake the cartridge but there is weeks worth of toner still in the cartrige. The menu is also non-intuitive. except for these two problems it is a great machine"
2,Decent printer but the Mac drivers stink,"I have this printer and it works well enough, and the toner lasts forever. However, despite being labeled ""Mac-compatible,"" Canon's drivers do no support scanning or two-sided printing. The third-party program Vuescan actually supports the scanner now (for years the answer was a virtual machine or Boot Camp partition running Windows), but that's extra money.It's deceptive to call a product ""Mac-compatible"" when the Mac functionality is crippled."
2,For Mac this is multifunction minus one...,"I bought this Canon to replace an inkjet multifunction which had high cost ink, and I rarely used color anyway. Works OK with mac as a printer, but there is no way to get a scanning function with Mac OS, and I've spent hours trying. On the good side, it works well as a stand alone fax and as a copy machine, so it is, at least, not completely useless."
1,Paper feed not working,"This printer never really worked. The paper feed is not working, i.e. it does not pull paper. You have to stand next to it and push the paper in there, even then its a hit and miss. Do not buy"
2,does NOT do double-sided copying!,"The description and specifications for this unit are very misleading:it doesn't do duplex scanning and the ""double-sided"" copying function only means double-sided printing of single-side originals. Quick, quiet unit otherwise but, unfortunately, I bought it to do double-sided copying... It's going back to amazon."
3,Scanner Frustrations,"I'm on Windows XP Pro and still not able to scan. I think this is due to lack of a scanner driver. I emailed support so I will see what they say about it. The MF Toolbox scanner software also takes forever to load or respond at times.Having some issues with getting Fax receive modes to work properly.Printing and fax transmission is fine, I like the ADF. The machine came with a starter cartridge that has been lasting for me thus far. Overall I think I got a great deal on this machine, I just need to get all the features to work and then I'll be set."
1,Worked great...for a week,"I bought this based on customer reveiws. The scanner function worked perfectly at first, then it started pausing about 80% through the page and leaving a grey line across the page at the point where it pauses. The printer worked perfectly at first too. Now it spits out blank pages."
1,No Snow Leopard drivers available!,"It has been over 3 months since the release of the Mac OSX 10.6 and to this day Canon has still not been able to provide a functioning printer driver for this machine. The response of their customer support people is essentially ""It will be coming when it's coming"" but it is evident that no real effort is undertaken to correct the problem, particularly in the light that Apple had made versions of 10.6 available to developers months ahead of time.In addition, there is absolutely no scanner support under OSX for this device - never has to the best of my knowledge. Although Canon sells this machine as Mac compatible, that is simply not true. They have always supported this device half-heartedly in the past and not at all since the inception of 10.6, and it also affects other machines in this product line, such as the 4350, etc.It is shameful for a company like Canon to behave that way towards its customers."
3,No love for Mac OS X,"This could've been a great printer, but Canon really dropped the ball with Mac OS X support. Most of the functionality of the device IS NOT available on Mac OS X. Duplex printing is NOT available. Scanning is NOT available. What's the point of selling a multi-function printer as Mac compatible if the multi-functions are not supported?"
2,Loaded with typoos,One of the worst proofreading jobs now in print seriously diminishes what otherwise might have been a useful reference.
5,"Solid chisel, a workhorse in my shop","I hand cut a lot of joinery and when I finally made the move from basic bench chisels to a proper mortising chisel, the difference has been night and day. Like the other Diefenbacher tools that I own, this chisel is well made and has some heft to it; exactly what a mortising chisel needs. As with any edge tool you buy, it required a short sharpening session before the first use, but it didn't take long to get the back flattened and get the front bevel honed. I've used it to cut out mortises in a number of woods including red oak, white oak, alder, hard maple, and southern yellow pine."
4,Works,"I bought this mouse for a super cheap price. It works as expected, but the quality of it feels very cheap. The downside for a wireless mouse its massive battery consumption. I would recommend getting a wired mouse just to offset the price you'd pay in batteries."
1,4 phones and counting...,"I've had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular. I've gone through 4 phones - the same thing over and over. Never did they (or I) put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD card (although right now it's working, and the card is not in it - go figure!). So, I guess the options are not download things, but have the phone work, or download things onto my SD card, and not have a phone?"
2,i think the phone was alot better,"Time to time the phone frezzes up the battery would last a half a day. the signal is poor sometimes its difficult to get out a call. i had always wanted a treo from the time i saw them, but in this treo 680 i was very dissapointed. i already bought it so i have to go ahead and try to work with it but right now i am not happy with my puchase. i hope the other models would be better than this one."
2,problem with garbled text,I have a Cingular 680 and I am having a bad problem with repeated non-functioning which happens in association with garbled text on the line where you normally see AT&T.;A patch for the problem has been promised by Palm for several months but is not out yet. It is important that peole know about this problem as it is quite widespread. You can read more about it on the Palm and cingular user forums.
2,Worst Phone!!,Palm could not resolve all the issues associated with Treo. I bought this phone few days back and it freezes frequently.
5,Believe the non-hype,"Good Lord, this record is fantastic. It was my first Silkworm purchase (I've since bought ""Developer,"" and anticipate buying more), and I have a hard time believing any of their other albums are better. If so, my brain will fry! I'm not sure that, barring Robert Quine or Marc Ribot, I've heard a better guitarist from the ""alternative"" world than Andy Cohen. I wish I knew which of their records had the most of his soloing, because I'd buy it instantly.As far as ""Italian Platinum"" is concerned, everything works magnificently. Albini's production is stellar, the songs get their claws into you on the first couple of listens, and the additional musicians add a nice touch to the proceedings (especially Kelly Hogan's vocals). This is an early contender for my rock album of the year, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Other than Spoon, I can't think of a band right now that shows more promise - but Silkworm's been at this for years now! Very impressive stuff, indeed."
3,Returned mine,"Got mine at Sams too. I used mine once and it worked ok. According to Karcher the pump problems that plagued earlier models is now addressed. The problem is that they didn't address the awful quality of the hose that goes to the gun. It kinks way too easily; very aggravating. It's too bad, this unit has nice features and isn't too heavy, but they simply have to improve the hose quality. It is no better than the hose on their electric pressure washers that are half as much (they kink too). I also will not buy another pressure washer that does not have at least a 35' (better yet a 50') hose on it. When you are drawing detergent and trying to wash out a garage, it's a pain to have to go and keep moving the unit around."
4,good replacement,"still working. fits well. not sure that it actually lasts any longer than it's ""OEM"" counterpart. but as usual for the money it rates well......"
5,phonics made fun,"I really like playing with Chunks with my [...] son. We learn to make silly words and real words and at the same time learn some needed skills for reading. Chunks are easily sorted into easy word groups and harder word groups (blends).By having the beginning sound(s) separate from the ending, you can work on rhyming as well."
4,Absolutely fantastic!,"It's great that slowly classic salsa is making it into mainstream music stores, like Amazon! This CD is jam packed with hardcore salsa dura! I could probably do without a few tracks (that's why minus one star) but to get a collection this good in one album deserves accolades! Just listen to the sampler!!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST LP'S RED GARLAND HAS EVER RECORDED,"I have ""All Night Long"" (with Kenny Burrell not the Brubeck album), and ""All Day Long"" (with Donald Byrd). Every serious jazz fan needs this LP. An original in nice shape will set you back $600+ so an OJC/Fantasy reissue is not a bad choice."
3,"Lovely book, not as much info inside","This is a really lovely book. The examples are very nice and I think most of them come from the authors own home. The three step guide to accesorizing is wonderful. I just wish she had taken a little more time writing. The pictures are vibrant and modern. It's a nice book, but could have used more written content."
2,Dated and disappointing,"I was SO excited to get this book. I know that the author is the granddaughter of the founder of Home Interiors and Gifts, and I mistakenly thought that Carter would use a lot of her family's company products in the decorating. Instead, there is little or none in the book. It is the author's own home, and non withstanding the beautiful cover arrangement, I was taken aback by what I find to be her dog-ugly decor. I know style is a very personal manner, but what about faith in your own company products? I have a LOT of Home Interior, and I was looking forward to learning how to use what I have in a better way. If I can get over the photographs, the book MIGHT tell me how to do that somewhere. So disappointed!"
5,If you seek YOU WILL FIND !,"This book is a gift to my heart.If ever one finds themselves grieving, this work offers comfort; if ever in a dry barren desert, this work offers a deep well of life, love and motivation to live the life God has created us to live.A very compelling book!George Papageorge MFTLicensed Marriage & Family TherapistDanville, California"
3,On the Decline,"I have always loved American Nightmare. I loved the self-titled CD, I loved The Sun is Getting any Brighter, and I especially loved Background Music.But now they're on the decline.This is a great CD--if you like alternative rock. This is a sorry excuse for hardcore. They are not brutal songs as one reviewer mentioned. Wes sings with a tired voice that wants to be hardcore but in reality is not. Background Music was the peak for this band. But Equal Vision Records eventually got to them as they have done with many other bands, changed their sound to make it appeal to a more mainstream audience, and ruined the band."
1,Great at First...,"I received this as an early Christmas gift from my boyfriend.It worked great...at first. Now, a few weeks later, it won't warm up my coffee at all. I was so excited to get this, as I drink a lot of coffee and hot tea throughout the day. Though now that I'm having issues with it (and I've tried 4 different types of mugs) it won't keep my coffee or tea warm...not even luke warm. Very disappointing. I've even tried plugging it into a different computer -- thinking maybe its just the usb plug I was using...didn't make any difference.Did I mention that this ""technology"" is disappointing?!"
1,Not an effective mug warmer.,"I have what appears to be the same product, but in black and made by ""apex intelligence.""The product is completely ineffective as a cup warmer. The heated surface is just under 3 inches in diameter, so a large ceramic mug will not fit correctly and will not make contact with the heater. If you use a smaller mug, or one with a tapered base, you will find that it doesn't warm up the mug at all. Yes, the center of the heated surface is quite warm to the touch, but the edges (where the cup makes contact) are not."
1,Ineffective,"Simple fact, a USB port isn't going to provide enough current to keep your coffee or tea warm."
3,Great as an introduction,"This is a great book if you are looking for an introduction to focus group. Very easy to read and to the point. However, if you're looking for methodology and design of focus groups this is not your book."
5,Focus Groups as Qualitative Research (Qualitative Research Methods),"Succint, accurate and practical. Great help for those entering the world of group interviews."
2,Not so great,"My 3 year old daughter loves pretending to be Dora and Diego, and saw this at a local store and begged for it for her birthday. It requires THREE watch type batteries, which cost us $10. That was a month ago, and the batteries are already dead. It's not as fun as you'd think, as the ""tools"" don't really do anything. There is a button that you press and Diego says a few things, but that's about it. There's a ""magnifying glass"" that flips up, which doesn't actually magnify. Oh, and it will clip onto a belt, if you get an adult to help you as it's really tough to do. Not worth the money, there are other more fun things in the line."
1,Not great,"This item was supposed to arrive two days earlier than it did as it was a gift for my nephew. We also ordered a couple other things for him that were not so great. This arrived and never worked, batteries were replaced and still nothing. I guess it is just for show now as it doesnt make any sounds. I will not purchase from this seller ever again."
5,Pearls and Peril,This book arrived in a very timely manner. There was a name written on the inside cover and discoloration on the outside cover from use. It was in good shape inside.
4,all's fine,"Got this as a gift for a left-handed milliner. She was happy with it, especially since she requested it! All went well."
1,Please: someone put me out of my misery,"The film Braveheart was truly magnificent and amazing to watch. It's one of my all time favourites, despite the historical inaccuracies.This book, however, is complete rubbish. I saw the movie before I read the book, so I was able to project pre-formed images and ideas into what I was reading. That made me able to finish this book. The grammar is so awful that one wonders how an editor would allow it to be published. It seems like he wrote a 10 grade (long) report on the movie. Images were not completely described, dialogue was not inserted well into the text and generally it was painful to get through. It does complete injustice to the wonderful screenplay that he wrote. My advice - stick to writing screenplays Mr. Wallace and leave the novel writing to novel writers."
1,See the movie; don't read the book.,"In the movie version of ""Braveheart,"" I was able to overlook the historical innacurracies because of the excitement of the battle scenes and the epic feeling of the entire movie. But in this novel version, those inaccuracies are glaring,and this reader - without the stirring excitement of the movie battles - could not overlook them, and could not enjoy the novel because of them. Even were the story fully accurate historically, it is not very well-written, and, as another reviewer stated, is a fit story for children, but adults had better seek another source."
2,It didn't happen,"It's all right as long as you don't mind the fact that Wallace died before Princess Isabella married the prince; Wallace and the Bruce are unlikely to have had many personal conversations; Wallace probably died during the torture and did not yell out freedom like some superhuman. Aside from that, it is an epic story that became that incredible movie. An entertaining read if you don't mind complete bastardization of Scottish history.For fact, try ""William Wallace: The Man Who Was Braveheart."" I don't remember the author, but it's a pretty fast, interesting book."
2,Braveheart by Randall Wallace,"As a Scotsman I first of all had grave doubts about seeing the movie version of BH. I was glad to find that it was quite an emotional film however. RW's buik however could perhaps be a little misleading to those not familiar with the story of WW, who think that this is how it happened. Personally I thought it was quite a guid buik for a 12 year old say, but if older readers wish to read a work of fiction which sticks more to the facts then they should seek out the buik ""The Wallace"" by Scots author Nigel Tranter. This buik makes BH luik like a Disney novel. I gave this review 3, not because of it's reliance on history, but more for the fact that it's an excellent adventure yarn for 12 year olds!!"
3,Braveheart,"Although not historically correct, this book never claimed to be. It may also be a book version of the film script, but if you came to this book from seeing the film, that is what you'd want. I think the other reviewers are being a little too harsh, this may be pulp fiction, but if you are prepared for that, it is a good enough read. It conveys the epic battles of the film and relationships in the film quite well and isn't too bad for a film tie-in novel. There is definitely scope for a decent faction book on William Wallace, but this is an OK read for fans of the film.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,This is not pure,"I have baked with this organic vanilla in the past and realized that it is not a ""pure"" vanilla extract. I found this product very misleading even though it's categorized has an organic product."
1,Hotel and Restaurant Commercials,"This is basically a bunch of commercials for the hotels and restaurants. Each one is around one minute - so this stinks as a DVD. After each one, it returns to a menu. I have gotten a lot more information reading books."
1,Amazon prime video sucks!,We cant actually watch tv shows we want and the videos that they do have are either stone age old or just sorry! Some Netflix competitor -_-
5,Magic City,Awesome series! Would definitely recommend. Has a lot of stories going on to keep you interested. Starz finally got it right this time.
5,Can't wait for Season 2,"This is a great show! Love the era, so realistic! Can't wait for Season 2 and Jeffrey Dean Morgan is hot!"
3,The sopranos on the beach,"Interesting well acted series about early 60s Miami Beach. However, a little too much nudity makes this a three rather than a four star production. More attention to the writing and plotting and less to sexuality of characters would have made it for me. Also, these are all lesser known tv actors."
2,DIDN'T LIKE IT,"I WATCHED THE FIRST DVD AND WASN'T IMPRESSED. THE FULL FRONTAL NUDITY OF THE MALE WAS NOT EXPECTED, I AM NOT A PRUDE BUT I AM FROM THE OLD SCHOOL AND THINK THAT SHOULD BE A PRIVATE THING KEPT IN THE BEDROOM NOT ON DISPLAY FOR ALL TO SEE. I WILL NOT BE GETTING ANY MORE DVDS. GAIL"
2,Hard to connect to these characters,"Heard this show was good, but I can't relate to any of these characters. Don't understand why people like it. Guess this glitzy 'living in the fast lane' kind of show just isn't my type of entertainment. Terrible portrayal of women, despite the cultural differences of that era (circa 1959 - 1960). Characters have very little depth, seem flat/ one-dimensional and not well-rounded believeable / real people. Also,the plot seems shallow and predictable. Disappointed!"
3,Magic City - alot of potential,"sets are great, the costumes, perfect, even the choice of characters and stars to play them, seems to be right on target, however the series falls short on story. too confusing and hard to follow. Not sure who is who, or what direction it is going"
5,A Real Work of Art,"The story, the characters, the film photography ... just to name a few is so well done it makes it easy to escape into another time. I love this series. Its abundant with rich texture. Well Done!!!"
1,Don't waste your time.,I threw this dvd away right after I watched it. Don't waste your time or money. Total garbage. But I'm not bitter.
1,Max Factor Lipfinity lipstick,"The color showed in the picture is not the same as the color they sent me. The one I received (and unfortunately I bought 2 of them) is much darker. So they are sitting in my make up case, maybe one of my friends might like it and they can have it."
5,excellent,"This product is perfect. I saved 1,5l per 100 km on my Jeep commander. The engine is running smoother.The Oil change can be extended."
4,Updated publisher's comment,"This story has in it the original Y2K bug! Not technically a bug, but a genetically altered form of lepidoptera, which produces larval forms with a voracious appetite for tobacco in the field! The industry is wiped out, in this book, in spite of the wickedness of those in charge, and we have a tobacco-free world in the year 2000. It was a great fantasy, while it lasted!"
2,Very Confusing Book,"I would not recomend this book. It was a required text for one of my classes, and it was terrible. I ended up reading only the first six chapters (instead of all 13) due to the way it was written. It is very easy to get confused due to the fact that the author continue to ramble on using complicated terminology. For readers with a lot of backround in endocrinology, biology and the structures of the brain, the book may be of some use - even though I have all of those backgrounds, I still found the book a terrible read due to all the rambling and repetition - very confusing book - you have to reread many of the paragraphs to figure out what he's talking about. For anyone just looking into the subject, don't bother with this book (try Life - The Science of Biology by Purves, Sadava, etc. for general biology or Animal Physiology by Randall, Burggren and French for a more advanced physiology text - both great books)."
1,not worth the money,"While many things from years gone by are superior in quality, creativity and craftsmanship to todays goods and services, this DVD of Berenstain Bears episode is quite the contrary. This DVD is not the modern version of the cartoon. Rather, this DVD is a collection of out dated, and rather shallow, cartoon programming. What a shame!"

2,Beautiful game - Horrible controls,"What a shame, The story seems great, the graphics are amazing, everything was extremely well thought out - except for the controls - (PC version) for some reason the X axis is extremely choppy - I tried to change the sensitivity but it did not help at all. Also you can invert the mous but its universal so it inverts for both ship and character - this is a problem if you play one way on the ship and another with a person - A real shame - could have been one of the great 3rd person games but is barely playable due to the controls."
2,Horrible voice acting.,"It is a decent game, but the atrocious voice acting & ""silly nature"" of the game bring it down to pretty much nothing."
4,Ala Peanut-buttah sandwiches!,"Strange game that takes place on an abandoned asteroid that is overrun by machines. I only have the DEMO but it's fun. Thier are numourous glitches however such as no dialogue tree at times with the characters(ANY of them) and sometimes there is a tree. The ""space"" ships as they are called do not travel beyond the asteroid, but the backdrop above is cool. This is a game about city living and city traffic... from outta'space.... or rather NOT D Mietri's planet. dominated by robots, of course it can't take place on other planets that are dominated by organics because the robots couldn't function there and this is about ROBOTS. The characters are comical and sound like they came off of seseame street with the quirky brookland accents and muppet-like heads. The game is still fun to play and the ships fun to ""drive"". Nice camera. Why only 4 stars? Because 4 is great, 5 is perfect! This isn't perfect but I am still asking for it for Chistmas."
4,Tight fit,"The hooks are just as advertised. They are heavy-duty, and I haven't seen any defects or rust, even they've been in my damp garage for a couple years. My main complaint is that the extra nib in the middle is a little too fat, so it is difficult to squeeze into a pegboard hole. The top goes in fine."
2,Not recommended for Showers.,"I did not find the information that I was looking for in this book. It gave general information, but I was not satisfied with the 'guts' of throwing a shower. I did find another book which was more indepth (although out of courtesy I will not mention it here.) I was looking for specific ideas on a variety of things in a shower and was disappointed. Good luck with your event."
1,Air Horn Review,"Ordered directly from Amazon.com with no shipping or handling problems. Replaced 10 year old air horns that were performing poorly in cold weather. Documentation notes a 20amp fuse should be used, and the horns come with a relay if you don't have a 20amp horn circuit. You must provide your own wire. Actual amperage is about 8-9amps, but according to Wolo this has the potential to double to 16-18amps, hence the 20amp fuse suggestion. Wolo also indicated that if the horns are connected to the car alarm, the motor could burn out prematurely due to the short bursts. Do not recommend this air horn to people inexperienced with their car's electrical wiring or air horns.Horns failed from 9-12 months of use, and are warranted for only 3 months. Recommend contacting Wolo directly if still interested and asking why no better warranty."
3,Great service from seller--but product leaves much to be desired,"I bought this set of horns to replace a set on my car, but if I would have known they were high pitched and sound like a childs bike horn, I wouldn't have. The seller lived up to expectations, quick service and delivery, but the product did not."
1,To Laura Brown,"I couldnt agree more. The fact that this book is even available is disgusting and speaks volumes for the kind of trash that this site sells. And guess what, they actually do allow child pornographers to sell their books. As we all learned today with the arrest of Phillip Greaves, this sight actually allowed him to sell his 'how to' guilde on child molestation, and not only allowed it, but defended it. So as long as this site allows dogfighters and pedophiles to prosper from the plying of their craft I will no longer be a client."
1,Disgusting,"Capitalizing on the brutality, violence, and abuse of the dog fighting world for financial gain is ghastly. Selling this material supports and perpetuates this horrible industry and sends the wrong message about our society. Until Amazon stops distributing this and other dog and cockfighting materials, I cannot in good conscience give them my business, and I will urge friends and family to do the same."
1,fighting dog breeds,"dr.fleig should have done more research before writing.Theres no proof that molossers started in tibet .its simply re- written material.Non functional sour mugs are presented as bulldogs.""Billy""the champ from the rat pits wasnt a bull terrier either,he was a manchester terrier.The french bulldog and pug should not even be in the book.Dr. fleig should stick to writing about what he knows,AKC show dogs."
1,Excellent for the,Excellent book for the most uneducated people who take pleasure in animal cruelty. Maybe Amazon will start selling child porn next- that will be a good accompaniment to these types of books. I am no longer a customer of Amazon.
1,Amazon needs to remove this book from it's inventory,"This book is about an illegal sport that is outlawed in all 50 states in the U.S. It encourages a ""sport"" that causes injury and death to the animals which are fighting, but also to animals which are used as bait dogs - often small dogs which are completely defenseless - and serve only to incite a blood rage in the fighting dogs."
3,Helpful,This book is helpful if you are trying to find your style of marker rendering it has a lot of helpful information and examples.
1,My cat could not have cared less,"This must be breed-specific or something because my cat could not have cared less. When I sprayed it on a counter top, he walked across it without hesitating. I also sprayed it on the top of a barrier gate to keep him out of our kitchen. He hopped up on top, sniffed it...licked it a few times...then continued over. And then when I put him back out of the kitchen he did it again. He did not show any distaste and it certainly did not prevent him from going on surfaces where it was sprayed."
1,Ineffectual,"Owning a new miniature schnauzer, I expected the teething stage at about five months and wanted to protect both my furniture and carpet from chewing and the possible other 'accidents'.Of a few taste deterents I purchased, this by far was the weakest of the bunch, and overall seemed to have no effect with my puppy. I realize that all dogs react diffrently, but my little guy acted as if I didn't use a drop.After using as directed daily and seeing no results after using 1/2 a bottle, thank goodness my local store took it back and allowed me to buy another product such as Bitter Apple or Boundry."
1,LORD FORGIVE ME FOR I AM GOING TO SIN...,"AFTER READING POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT I decided to go ahead and purchase it. my mothers cat climbs on all my furniture as if it was a playground for him (which gets under my skin). So, instead of *ACCIDENTALLY* leaving the screen door open in hopes that never returns, I thought this product would be a better way on earning so points with God.HUGE MISTAKE! THIS SPRAY DOESN'T WORK AT ALL! I CAN'T BELIEVE I WASTED MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP! Do to the result of this product not living up to its name- IT'S BYE BYE FOR KITTY TIME!I do love animals but there's a limit.Oh, Btw, I know others will feel the need to negatively comment on my review as an attempt to ""Insult"" me but I thrive on negativity =)"
1,don't bother,"I saturated the cushions of both my couch and chair - the very next day, my cats were just as comfortable as the day before the application. In my case, this was a waste of money. All 4 cats ignored the smell."
1,"Product is a failure, a BIG ZERO.!",I ordered to buy 2 bottles of this product at the same time because I thought that I would be saving some money on shipping and handling cost. I applied it as directed to my furniture (the dinning chairs and sofa in the living room)but it did not work at all. The cats still jump in and sit on top of the furniture. This product is NOT EFFECTIVE to repel my cats from staying off the furniture. I recommend not to be fooled to buy this product because it's just a WASTE OF MONEY. The company that makes this product should modify the ingredients used to be more effective.
3,Not as good as I'd hoped.,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found this video to be disappointing. I mean, how difficult can it be to make an erotic lesbian vampire film? All you need is one gorgeous lesbian vampire, and then add several beautiful victims for her to prey on, right? But this video, like most of the others, gets wrapped up in a stupid plot, and the girl-girl stuff is added more like window-dressing. I was disappointed. Why can't the producers of these things hire some creative, imaginative writers before they begin shooting? The women in this video are all attractive, but the end-result is (in my opinion) disappointing."
3,"Gorgeous women, but toothless!","Nicely shot, but a lot of fast-forwarding through acres of cheesy dialogue before much happens. Shelly Jones is stunning, but seems to have forgotton vampires have fangs!"
3,Hot Vampire Nights,"This was a cheesy movie, but the plot kinda grows on you after a few times. I would recommend this to all vampire lovers"
3,Repetitive but informative,"The Wyoming Corporate Handbook repeats a lot of the material that Gary Sutton has published. It does a great job communicating the basics but I would have preferred to learn more about Wyoming. I would purchase ""How to use Limited Liability Companies and Limited Partnerships"" by Gary Sutton."
4,Circle T Euro Leather Lead,"I have used this product for the last two weeks and it has performed at expectation. It is versitile allowing several lengths to be used during the walks. It also allows for greater control of my dog, without the hand pain associated with a nylon leash. Would give it 5 stars, but have not had enough experience with the leash to go that far. One caution is I would go to the 1/2 inch size if you pouch is under 80 pounds."
3,A valuable story but slow,"The previous reviewer summarizes the book well, so I won't repeat that here. The texture of this growing-up and coming-out novel is rich, both verbally and descriptively. You not only see and hear the 1960's, but they feel as dull and entrapping as they were. The main character, Justin Crystal, is portrayed in depth, and we are allowed to glimpse the inner thoughts of his mother as well, but their lives are so ordinary, and we are dragged through them in too much quotidian detail. Joyce conveyed this kind of experience marvelously in Portrait and Dubliners, but here it is sometimes almost as boring to read as it must have been to live."
3,Not impressed,"Ok, maybe I'm not the market for this book or maybe I was turned off by the very obvious ""romance author"" pseudonym, but the book didnt' live up to the reviews I read on-line. I had a hard time with the 50s movies images along with the 1990s anachronisms. And I guessed the ending well in advance."
2,Too clever by half,"The book was mildly amusing, but not as clever as Mr. Devereaux seemed to think he was. The characters were paperthin and I couldn't bring myself to care about them. I've definitely read better books by better practioners. Better luck next time.."
5,Totally Enjoyable!,"You know, it's not too late in the year to call this a great book to take to the beach. It truly is. I have several friends who have this book now, and they kept telling me to read it. So, if they wanted me to read it so bad, why didn't they loan me THEIR copies? They said they wanted to read it again. I can see why, now, and I'm certainly not going to loan MY copy out to anyone, either! I have yet to see what the naysayer here saw. I was raised in the ""business"" in the 50s. The eclectic mix of the 50s movie scene and the book's 90s readability was spot-on for me. I think anyone who doesn't give this book a chance is going to be sad later that they missed such a good read. I did some checking. This author has more books coming out before the end of the year. I'll be looking for them, and this time, I'm going to be the one buying the books and telling everyone else to get their own copies!"
1,Product Image is misleading,"Five clips and screws are shown in the product image, but you only receive three. The item number on the package matches the number in the title, so it doesn't seem to be a shipping error. Instead, just shoddy internet marketers who didn't feel like posting an image that accurately portrays the amount of product you'l receive."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this item intending to use it for various hanging tools. The first place I tried was a broom. The broom was within the 1"" to 1-1/2"" diameter limit and was quite light (less than the 5# limit). The broom would not stay in the clip. It just does not work and I will return it and go with another type."
5,"Great movie, but beware the subtitles!","This is an old favorite of mine. Love the sets--typical of old Hollywood grand production days... However, the DVD is subtitled in CHINESE, with no way to turn off the subtitles. Quite annoying! No english menus are available, all Chinese. Very distracting from a great movie! FOX MOVIE CLASSICS, WHERE ARE YOU AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU DONE A DVD ON THIS MOVIE????"
4,The Egyptian,"Beautiful color and CinemaScope print. Nota great film by any means, but have always found it very entertaining especially for the exquisite Bernard Herman and Alfred Newman score. Also found Peter Ustinov and Gene Tierney much fun to watch. Biggest draw back is Edmund Purdom in the lead, a very wooden and unemotional actor."
4,Dori speaks,"Ok, I didn't really pay attention when purchasing this, but Dori's tail makes her speak. This thing drove me crazy the first week or so. I couldn't turn it off or lower the volume - and it's loud enough to be annoying. I will say the fish is good quality and looks like Dori. The voice sounds pretty good - good enough for my daughter. No real educational value, but if your child, grandchild etc. enjoys Finding Nemo - he/she will enjoy this fish. If you received an annoying ray-gun, fire truck, or some other noise making toy from a friend that drove you crazy - you could pay it back and buy this fish for their child :-)"
4,I used it in my shapeshifting course... A good resource for beginners.,"As with anything, there are many ways to get there. This is a good approach if you are exploring Shapeshifting for the first time."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"What I liked about Raife's first two books was that they were filled with hope. Her characters were imperfect people who matured, grew up, and otherwise became better people. This book was filled with one-dimensional characters -- curmudgeonly old aunt, shrewish ex-wife -- and I didn't like the use of a disability as a way of propelling the plot. Perhaps her next book will be better."
5,No one does romance in Scotland better than Raife,"~<p~ <p~ fans of contemporary rural stories. The story line constantly is propelled forward by superbly drawn secondary players, but it is Sally, whose ability to disassociate is told with insight and warmth by Ms. Raife, that makes this book a wonderful reading experience. Like the author's previous romances, DRUMVEYN and WILD HIGHLAND HOME, MOUNTAIN HEATHER is a rich tale.<p"
3,My Opinion,"I quite enjoyed Mountain Heater, but found it was a bit predictable and rather light-weight.I have enjoyed Alexandra Raife's other novels much more.However for a quick read with a happy ending Mountain Heather fits the slot."
5,Le Creuset Dish,This dish was larger than I expected. It is very useful for my family dinners. Very well made and should last for years. Would recommend.
5,It is simply great!,"It is a great size, can handle just about anything very impressed...Glad I have it, Easy to clean up. The only thing is that it is pretty heavy on its own, so you really need to be careful with food inside..."
3,Not stove-top friendly!!!!,Warning to potential purchasers: this particular item is not for use on the stove-top. Keep looking if you want a stove-top to oven version...
1,A waste of time and money,The CD consists of the same repetitive guitar noodling with random drum beat and someone making a noise between a chant and a gargle in the background. It is a continuous loop of the same sound.
4,VERY ENJOYABLE -- TENDER LOVE STORY,"Patrick Cameron is sending another woman on her way. He's had enough of women wanting his money.After getting his brother out of so many scrapes he wants nothing to do with marriage. Until he meets little Jess.Claire Franklin is convinced that Patrick is Jess's father, until she learns that he has a brother. The most intriguing part was that she was refusing help from Patrick.Dog and Patrick's parents are wonderful supporting characters.And Patrick's gentle and tender care of Jess helped to win Claire's wary heart.The attraction and hormones esculated to desire and then to lust? Neither would admit readily to love.The English barn became an intriguing center piece to the story along with Jess's parentage.Definitely Recommended --M"
3,Circle T Euro Lead,"This is a well made leash, however this leash comes with several uses and there were not any instructions included with this leash. My main purpose for buying this leash was the ease of walking two dogs with it. Well, I never figured out how that function worked and ended up sending it back. I was disappointed! I think there should have been a diagram included with pictures on each use of the leash. I probably would have kept this product if I had known how to use it?!"
3,"Not that bad, but not the greatest",Well this item is ALOT bigger then pictured. It is quite painful. But after a while you'll get used to it. I wouldn't recommend but it's not bad once you get used to it the rippled feel pleasueable.
4,Almost 5 stars!,"Very good, as all the books of Steven Forrest. He is excellent. Only 4 stars because I would like to read more about de Transposition Houses (example: My Sun in your 4th house, etc.)"
4,Very Helpful,"After the previous two presidential elections didn't turn out the way I wanted them to, I decided to take matters into my own hands on a local level.I found this book to be extremely helpful in managing my first campaign."
2,You get your $15 worth,"If you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment, this isn't for you. The radio is hard to use since it doesn't have any indication of what frequency you are on, and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static. The pedometer function is marginal at best. But its what you would expect for $15."
4,great!,"Excellent pedometer for the money. Worthwhile investment. I only had to play around with the step measurement sensitivity, and now it works great. Radio works great also.. Definately reccommend."
5,Thorough and Well-Organized,"This is an incredibly meticulous presentation of the annihilationist debate as well as a fantastic elucidation of Edwards' theology regarding annihilationsim. The content is simultaneously readable, well organized and concise. Morgan first presents the history, proponents and their arguments, and the evangelical responses to annihilationism. Then the author gives a summation of Jonathan Edwards theological method and its application to the debate as it rages today. Morgan explains that one's view of Hell is directly affected by one's doctrine of God and sin. Edwards' argument against the view of annihilationism, therefore, begins with the most fundamental doctrine in Christian theology for refutation, the doctrine of God. And Edwards does it well. Having minimal previous knowledge of this specific topic, I found this book to be thoroughly enlightening and a very stimulating read."
5,Natures Wonders,"This is a really great book for EVERYONE to read! Too often we grab a can of Ant spray when we see the ""trails""..Our three year old grandaughter loves the outdoors and seems to notice everything, the snail trails, the aphids, the wilted roses, the dandylions, and YES the ants. She always asks where they are going in such a hurry and why.We have purchased Mortimer and Friends for her and several of our friends children...They love it but so do we!!We have lots of ""picnics"" at our house and now have a different view of the reason for ""friends"" and how important they are to everyone.. Thanks Jim and Connie for a wonderful, colorful dooropening to FRIENDSHIP with all Gods creatures.."
4,Great for Complicated Home Theaters,"If you have a complicated Home Theater setup, you probably already have a universal remote. If you have one from Universal Remote Controls, then this RF distribution box is nearly essential.It's important to note that this device is not for the technologically faint of heart. You have to do some additional programming of your remote. You have to figure out where the IR receiving element is on your components (if you choose to use the leads) and you have to experiment with signal strength.All that said, the end result is very impressive."
2,"DOESN""T WORK AT ALL; no customer support","Unfortunately no matter what I have tried to make this product work, it does not work with the Osiris remote, when I called the company, the tech said to go to a factory authorized dealer...when I went to ""house of Music"" in San Francisco, the sales rep said they only assist clients that buy it from their store.Save your money...it sounds like a great idea to be able to work a device from any room but this one it too time consuming to set up."
3,Not Kay's best work,This story become laborious and predictable. A few good parts keep it from being a total miss. I wouldn't read it again.
3,Good,Karen Key is a great author when it comes to Indian Love Stories. It has been awhile since I read this book so I don't remember too much of it but it was pretty good. I just got irritated with the whole thing of her guardian not telling her who she was or what her purpose was and then she willing just left the love her of life without a fight just because she felt as if she owed him. Which I can respect that but I just did not agree with it. Then she willing got engaged to a person she did not know and did not know what he looked like. It was irritating too that it took the book so long to say who in the heck she was and why people were trying to kill her. In the end she made a great choice for herself finally (which actually she did the first time she laid down with the guy) and with them in that house with all them people did noone hear her cries of passion (Im just saying :))
4,Man o' Mann!,"This recording is beautiful baby! No, Herbie never wails, Roy Ayers plays smooth, Sonny Sherock doesn't go Jimi Hendrix on you. The arrangements are cool, the suite sweet and lovely, it's a mellow fellow and the orchestra feels it just right. If you like the Herbie Mann with Strings album you will enjoy this-or vice versa. Not essential but very cool."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this set because the idea of a countersink, with a correctly sized tapered pilot hole in one step seems like a time saver. The set delivers on these points as long as you don't need to move the countersink towards the tip to accommodate a shorter screw. The set screws that hold the countersink in place have very little to take purchase on when it is moved onto the flutes of the drill bit. Thus, the countersink has both slipped and wobbled. This set will go in the trash when I receive the 3pc Pro Countersink Set from Rockler. This system uses a much longer sleeve between the countersink and the drill bit allowing you to move the drill within the sleeve and having adequate purchase for the set screws of the countersink."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I found the depth ajustment to be useless as once you tighten the set screw it warps the bit and loses its center, I had to use a bit from another set. The countersink and stop collar work fine."
4,This is a good assortment for a decent price,"These countersink bits are decent quality and the size assortment is pretty good. I have had good luck using these to drill pilot holes and recess screw heads in all types of wood.My only real complaint is that within a few months of owning the set, the depth adjustment ring on one of the bits cracked in half. I think they should be made well enough that you cannot crack it with a tiny allen wrench!I really like everything about this set (except the broken depth ring) and I recommend it as a good deal for this price."
1,Very Poor,"I have just received and used these Steelex tapered bits. The results were poor. The bits do not cut, especially into hardwoods like oak. Even in soft woods they do not cut without a significant amount of pressure on the drill. Other, more expensive, tapered bits I have used worked well. In addition to the foregoing problems the bits would spin in the drill chuck. I tried them in two different drills, both well known brand name drills which have not had any chuck problems before, and neither would hold the bits well. I do not recommend this product.AD2"
2,Poor Poor Quality,"I love the Steelex casters, so I figured I'd give these a try. Wow, these are poor quality. The screw is almost useless and the countersink is nigh near impossible to prevent from slipping on the shaft. I do not recommend these Countersinks. I gave them 2 stars because you get a wooden box to keep them in and I really like the Steelex Casters.Steelex D2610 4-Inch 275-Pound Swivel Double Lock Polyurethane Plate Caster"
4,WOODSTOCK INTERNATIONAL G1728 7-PC TAPERED COUNTERSINK SET,"I AM WELL SATIFIED WITH THE PRODUCT SO FAR, I'VE DRILLED ABOUT 40 HOLES IN PINE AND PLYWOOD AND THEY STILL SEEM VERY SHARP, HAVN'T TRIED THEM WITH A HARDWOOD."
4,Finale!!,This dvd includes the finale to dbz. A must have for hardcore fans! I plan to get this as soon as it comes out! The only reason I rated it 4-star was because the batles stink. The only reason a none-hardcore fan should buy this is because of the final showdown of Buu and Goku. The price should be a bit lower though. I am still getting this!
4,Solid and worth a listen,"Good solid creative rock. Inventive arrangements. Up to date. Intelligent influences. The comparisons to Beck are somewhat correct, it's kind of a more experimental and hard counterpoint to his music. Beck fans might like this. Can't call this brilliant though because it's not trail blazing.Guys like this can end up really great or fizzle out."
4,Another great record that won't get attention,"Such style packed into an album it's almost sick. Enon flirts with different styles and pulls them all off. With all the sound-alike ""alternative"" bands out there in HEAVY rotation on whatever Clearchannel controlled station is on in your area, I'm stupified (but never surprised) that here is another original record that most people will never hear... Deprivation. If you want to pick up something that rocks with intelligent, excellent songcraft, you'd be well served to pick up this album."
2,Trying too hard,"2 1/2Overly rambunctious pop experimenters continued to pursue worthy goals through dedicated, and singular explorations, though this time around the songwriting feels mediocre at best. Most often the jagged combination of spazzy electronics and warped pop songwriting do not add up to anything worthwhile. Only a few noticeable tracks, perhaps only one true standout (Natural Disasters), High Society is too preoccupied with it's drugged out catchiness to match their better releases of drugged out catchiness with greater composition."
4,"Yes, She was.","She played bass on the first album. And this is from Touch and Go's ""official"" bio:""Enon were formed by John Schmersal when his previous band, Brainiac, were tragically forced to call it a day. The band's first album, ""Believio"" was essentially John's solo record, but he toured with a revolving door of musicians. By 1991 however, the band had solidified into a three piece, with Toko Yasuda (formerly of Blonde Redhead and The Lapse)""Just because she's Japanese doesn't mean you should automatically assume they're confusing her with Kazu."
1,miami dance,"im not surprised we never heard from this artist ever again. after listening to the whole album ,it amazes me how a producer can work with such an inept vocalist. after hearing the title track ""i want you"" this was a pleasing enough dance-pop song that could have been sung by madonna (at least then it would have been interesting)but after that its all downhill from there. considering this was mostly produced by a very talented producer ,lewis martine, im surprised the songs were so lackluster. she makes j-lo sound like whitney...file this one under ""bad 80s singers"""
4,"harsh, drug-induced, stunning","Fabulous read. You'll wonder about the Japanese character after this book. It's not tea services and complex go games, it's an insightful William Burroughs. The descriptions are clear and pungent, unlike most of what came out of the US in the 60's. Includes a great sex scene as well as good drug descriptions. An interesting distance is set up between the characters and the reader so that you are amused by all the horrible things that happen, then you wonder what in your own soul could care so little."
3,cool but done before,This is a cool book. I found his descriptions of his feelings towards the end of the novel more interesting than the sex and drugs. I suggest to people who enjoyed this book and haven't read Henry Miller's 'Tropic of Cancer' to check out what the real master did 50 years earlier.
3,Abject Beauty,This book shimmers in places with brilliant light. I don't like the characters so I can't sympathize with them. There is abject beauty to this book. I can appreciate that. But this book will never be a favorite of mine. I have to be able to identify with at least one character.
3,almost transparent characters,"If nothing else, this book will shatter any illusions you may have had about Japan and its people fitting any stereotypes or what you thought were your astute observations on them. However the novel soon runs out of steam and ends somewhat predictably. The sexually explicit passages are quite compelling and realistic overall, but maybe used too much later when the focus is weak. The subplot involving the narrator's imaginary City isn't very interesting. It is a must-read for the serious student of Japanese and a quick one at that. In the end though, other novels like Box Man and some Tanizaki or Dostoyevsky evoke the same sort of conscious self-destruction with more insightful endings.This book is like Less Than Zero but in 1970's Japan. While I did enjoy the book and was able to relate a few tamer pieces of it to some of my own experience, the end didn't quite live up to beginning. You could argue that the same is true of the lifestyle in the book."
4,A Must Read for Eastern Literature,"Through the course of Almost Transparent Blue, Ryu whirls the reader into the Japanese subculture of the sixties. Although the story may seem predictable and not quite a shocker, it serves to decentralize the focus of the American ""hippie"" to other cultures of the time. I feel that any reader will walk away from this book with quite a different image of Japan. The ending of this short novel is the most fascinating section. Here Ryu interlinks his society to himself as an individual and the rather despondent substance abuse that plagues his world. A good story to read at least once!"
4,A work of a genius that cannot be translated,"It is a shame that Ryu Murakami is so little known to the rest of the world. Yet, it is little wonder considering how much of his genius is inevitablly lost in the translation. I wish there was a way in which the English-language reader could feel the quiet rythms of his prose. It would make the book a lot more haunting."
2,"Disturbances: bile, semen, snot, vomit, and saliva.","Into the abyss. Never has such a short book felt so agonizingly long. Murakami's book is a study in the many nadirs of Japanese drug users in the 1970s. Their relationships are strained, the drugs are addictive and horrible, and sanitation is absent. The book feels exaggerated and stylized, as if the author magnified his own experiences five-fold. There's a kind of cool glossiness in the tone. This distance partly works: the characters feel like walking dead, but partly creates a kind of depraved allure. In the end, the book could be read as a ""just say no to drugs"" scree: its people are empty and unreflective. Redemption is no where to be seen--not for its characters or for the novel."
2,makes sex & drugs seem as boring as hell,"this book is monotonous, just scene after scene of drugs and puking and sex. it's shocking for the first page or two, then just banal."
3,"sex & drugs, sex & drugs, ... Japan as you never knew it","'Almost Transparent Blue' is very difficult to review. Although a translation, the book is well-written and the prose, such as it is, flows well. But there is almost no plot, just and endless sequence of young Tokyo-ites getting stoned, puking, and having violent sex. The characters are wasted youths.But there is almost, *almost*, a charm to this book. It does have a flow like something from Kerouac, and it captures nicely the lives of lost Japanese youths of the 1970s. Yet it is such a bleak, *totally gross* read that I can't recommend it to anyone. Instead look to *Haruki* (not Ryu) Murakami's works for a more palatable view of modern Japan/Japanese people.Bottom line: weird, some curiousity value, but too vile to recommend."
2,Really not very good,"I couldn't finish it...I just hated everything about it, except the cover, which was very cool."
1,not even transparent blue,"If you enjoy books about ..[drugs], ...drinking too much ...and their friends buy this book."
3,Who can you trust?,"An average book that could have been really good if it were a bit more realistic. After Kenya catches her boyfriend cheating on her, she vows that she will never let herself get hurt again. Until she meets Scott... He's everything that she's ever wanted in a boyfriend--sweet, handsome, funny, loyal. Is he too good to be true? Kenya is determined not to make the same mistake again. She will have to put Scott to the test and see if he can resist her beautiful, flirtatious friend Monica. The plan just has to work! Right?!?"
5,Why is this album impossible to find?,One of my favorite albums of all time and I only have a ratty cassette tape of it from the 80's. I've been looking for a digital version for years.
3,Enthralling but should have ended sooner,"This is a great, first historical novel with interesting, complex characters. I really enjoyed it up to around page 240 or so. After that the characters' morality all seemed to go downhill and when an aged man developed an attraction to an 8 year old I was totally thrown and confused by his character. I find it hard to believe a man could be attracted to such a young girl. So the novel lost its sense of authority for me. Though I did finish it, it was without the relish with which I started it."
2,Readable Novel of the Heresy,"Tanya Mravik, 32 year-old single female, Los Angeles, CAI was introduced to the Cathars and the heretical Inquisition through Stephen O'Shea's The Perfect Heresy. It was so fascinating to me that my supervisor at work recommended that I read another book about the heresy that was written by a student who had gone through our writing program (at UCLA Extension). That book, a novel, is called The Good Men: A Novel of Heresy and was written by Charmaine Craig.Ms. Craig has done a SUPERB job researching for this novel and her writing style gave life to these characters who are based on real people who lived in the Middle Ages. She has made the human issues as realistic as those that we deal with today.This book was highly entertaining, educational, relevant, and should be read and enjoyed by everybody who is interested in the Inquisition, the Medieval time period, and/or southern France."
3,Readable but not memorable,"The cover synopsis and the praise quotes from various reviewers influenced me enough to buy this book; however, the deeper I got into the novel, the more I thought that I was reading something very different than what the reviewers read. While I continued to read the book, it was very hard to look past the book's obvious flaws.Many of the characters were not developed well, and the whole concept of naming the book _The Good Men_ is very strange. The Cathars play a very tertiary role in this book, only appearing right before someone dies. It seemed that the book's real story was about three generations of women and their relationship with a perverted pedophilic priest... and the cover of the book said nothing about that."
1,"Simplistic writing, and an unfortunate author.","The introduction to Japan and the Tokugawa Era provided in this book was good, but I thought the plot and character development was simple. I wouldn't have minded this and would've still rated it an okay book except that upon posting a relatively benign review of it on Goodreads, the author himself verbally snarked back at me. A few of my students posted and he insulted them as well! I couldn't believe it.Suffice it to say I'm even less impressed with his work now, and certainly wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing his novels. I can't wait to introduce my students next year to a better representation of Japan (during the Heian Period): excerpts from The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, an amazing historical artifact. So long, ""Demon."""
3,attractive sterling silver green jade bracelet,"For the inexpensive price this is a great casual jade bracelet. Very comfortable to wear and is really attractive. I have received many compliments. The clasp opens a little too easy after many wears but the bracelet will not fall off. For an everyday casual inexpensive jewelry I can't complain. I wear it every day in a chemistry lab, so I did not want to purchase something too expensive. I just love"
5,Great,"I have to disagree with the wobbly fan person. If you mount it correctly, per the instructions that are included, you can hang from the fan if you wanted to. Now I have two of these in my sun room and they are out of the way mounted on the wall and much more powerful than those cheap fans you get at home depot. Pull string lets me change the fan speed with a short tug I recommend these to anybody with a home garden."
1,too loud to use,"i mounted this as per instructions and it hit a frequency that rattled the whole house on high, its a loud hum on low , it makes this fan only usable in the day, i believe its off-center a bit"
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL - BW/WM,"Sometimes, books are incorrectly classified so I wanted to put in my title that this is indeed one of those rare finds: a HISTORICAL IR BW/WM romance.It's amazingly well written. The heroine is independent but vulnerable. The hero is equally so, although we don't understand why until the very end.It's a happy ending and you wish that there were a sequel featuring them because you can easily imagine them having a happy, extremely interesting life in future novels."
2,High Fructose Corn Syrup Included!,"I just bought the new 'improved' chocolate peanut butter zone bars. I've bought them for years in bulk at Sams. They are the only bar I've seen without HFCS that tastes great. I eat them and feel good about giving them to my family instead of those 'fruity HFCS' bars for snack. When I bit into the 'new' bar the chocolate was very smooth and the inside 'crunch' was chewy. I knew that 'chewy' generally comes from HFCS - it's cheaper.I called customer service and explained that HFCS goes against everything the Zone is! Abbott Labratories said they have distanced themselves from The Zone and their affiliation with Dr Sears. They explained that they did add calcium and fiber to the bar. However, if you look at the nutritional info the bar is no longer 40-30-30 and sugar and salt contents have also gone up.If you're disappointed with the change please call them! Until the old formula comes back, I'm on a quest to find the new perfect protein bar...any suggestions?"
3,"Some good, some not so good.","I enjoyed some of the poems and the pictures, but too many of the poems lost my interest. I find the anthology ""Cowboy Poetry: A Gathering"" from Hal Cannon much better.My complaint is that many of the poems are free verse and filled with obscure allusions, much like main stream poetry. I read cowboy poetry for its content and form, and both were lacking in many of these poems. I recommend you try somewhere else if you're looking for good cowboy poetry."
5,Recent recipient of Wrangler Award from Cowboy Hall of Fame,"A collection of fine land-based poetry, and beautiful, haunting photographs -- perfect for any collection of western verse"
5,Jepetto,"I just saw Jepetto in concert at Indiana University. They are a great band. If you have the chance, go see them in concert. You won't be disappointed."
1,crap,luckily i borrowed this book from my university library instead of buying it. the cover design and naming of the book are fantastic but the content is all crap.
1,I would pass on this book in my humble opinion.,"More work and deeper indepth research would make this book perfect. Sadly, in this case, its not true."
4,love it,"I love Drizzt and I wish the humans of Earth were all like him. I was very happy with this book. It takes us into the city of menzo and lets us know what happen after the drow war. For i as was wondering about that after i finshed R.A. Salvatore's books. I found that reading both of Elaine's books is important to understand the whole story.For true D&D fans know that there are good Drow as well as evil just like all other races. I hope that Drizzt and Liriel meet each other and become friends. Then Drizzt will know that he is not alone. That is what is so wonderful about TSR books, all the races blend together to make one whole adventure. I have read every single book of the forgotten realms and other worlds so i know it is true. If you love Drow and adventure then read Elaine's 2 novels of the underdark."
5,I loved it,"I love this book. I feel with the characters. I even find the bad guys interesting (I usually get bored with the vilians).Maybe I like this better than others because I'm not a Salvatore fan. Only read the Icewind Dale trilogy, and wasn't impressed at all.DotD has everything to make it great. It worked for me. I loved the way teh drow were. ""Without joy."" Striving for, not knowing it didn't exist. Liriel's first understanding of friendship was great. She never imagined a situation like that, a state of being like that, possible. To her frienship was hanging out with someone until they tried to kill her.Yes, she was a spoiled brat. She was meant to be. Nobility and honor were things she had to learn. So was the reality of consequences for actions. She had to grow up. By the end of Tangled Webs, we believe she's done it well."
2,Only for patient Drow fans,"While the story flows well, Ms. Cunningham's grasp of Drow culture in Menzoberranzan and life in the underdark is at best tenuous. At times I felt as if I was reading a bad episode of ""Menzoberranzan goes Beverly Hills 90210"". Liriel, the main character is interesting however for a magic user incredibly skilled as a warrior. The introduction of the other drow deities is the book's saving grace. I believe Ms. Cunningham should stick to writting about the surface elves, where she's more cofortable with the setting, henceforth making for much better stories."
1,Awful!,"This book was just plan awful. I can't believe I read the entire book, I should've stopped reading it after the first ten pages (which was the only good part of the book). The characters are not interesting and as a matter-of-fact I hated them. The main character Lirel (sp), seemed to me like a spoiled brat not a deceitful drow. The Fodo, fordo, whatever his name was barbarian/warrior character was only cool when he got mad (which he didn't do a lot) and his backround story was a joke. I higly recommend to NOT read this book. It gives a poor description of the drow life and Menzoberranzan."
1,Dire.,"The author has no grasp of Drow society and her attempt to make a teenage love story out of what should have been an exciting book is a total failure.The main character has no depth at all and the whole story is shallow. I suggest Ms. Cunningham should take some time to learn about the Drow before she writes any more about them.As for the evil Drow turns good theme... Salvatore already used that one past it's peak, this is just plain boring now."
1,"no sir, I didn't like it","Maybe I was expecting another 'Homeland', but DOTD just didn't do anything for me. I couldn't care about any of the characters or what was going on so I don't think I'll be reading the next book. A pity, I love the Drow."
4,Great book,"I personally loved this book. The only reason I rated it as a four star book was because the first few pages were hard to follow. The beginning, and I mean in the VERY beginning, there is a lot of characters to be introduced. I had to do a bit of back skimming to remember them, but it worked out fine. Its easily followed as soon as you get out of the first few pages of the book. i love the idea of a rebel drow, one who dreams and aspires to have adventure. Liriel is a dynamic character who loves to party, but still has ruthless drow qualities. Fyodor is a simple human feeling simple feelings for this Drow girl, even though he knows the drow are ruthless beings. I highly recommend this book for someone who is patient and can follow a plot. you will get into the very heart of the book and hardly want to put it down."
2,Drizzt vs Liriel,"There are two distinct visions of what Menzoberanzan really is. One, is that of Drizzt, the Salvatore character. The other is Liriel, the Cunningham character. I have read all the books by both authors, and they are all well written. The primary difference is that each character undergoes differing sets of circumstances. Drizzt is a noble male raised in a violent matriarchal society. Liriel is a noble female in the same society. Liriel, through her series of books, has to learn the lessons of honor and loyalty, not mention responsibility and proper behavior because it was never taught to her. Liriel's story is the the female perspective of drow culture. Drizzt's is the male. As a reader of both, I found Salvatore did not really emphasize female perspective. To truly understand the drow cities, be it Menzoberanzan of Ched Nasad, both authors are a must read."
1,Wrong picture. Wrong watch.,I purchased this Washington Capitals watch with the LOGO as pictured. It was the black eagle. What I received was the new LOGO. Wrong picture for this product. DON'T BUY THIS WATCH!
4,Molto bene!,"In this CD Andrea Bocelli demonstrates why people say that he has one of the most privileged voices in the world. You can sense Andrea's passion for music in each song specially in La Luna Che Non C'e and Caruso, my two favorites. If you appreciate good music then this CD definitely should be in your music collection."
4,"Bocelli still thrills, despite repetition of titles","Andrea Bocelli has the finest tenor voice since the young Pavarotti. Whether he is singing opera or pop, in Italian, English, or German, his voice is by turn warm, soothing, thrilling--completely commanding. And his English diction is better than some American singers'. The down-side of this album is that most of the titles are already on other discs. But does this really matter? The reason to buy this one is Miserere, in which he does both parts with total mastery. And don't worry that you don't understand the Italian; the translations that come with the Romanza disc don't make all that much sense. As with his other albums, I could listen to this one forever and never get tired of it."
1,Totally Useless!,"This is a lousy camera case and the label, ""Deluxe,"" a joke. I immediately returned the item after receiving it. Almost no protection is provided for the camera, there are no pockets in which to carry anything, etc., etc. Don't waste your time or money!"
3,Canon Pro1 protecting case,"It is very usefull to keep your machine protected.However every time that you need to take picture ,the case must store separetly.Ideally is that hangs from the machine"
2,Beware the content!,"The benefit of this book is that it provides an intelligently structured approach to reviewing the material needed to pass the VB exams for the MCSD certification.On the other hand, the text itself is rife with errors of fact, which is not acceptable in a technical manual and especially not in a book that purports to help you review for technical exams that may be worth thousands of dollars to you. For example, chapter 9, exam question 7 has no right answer because none of the T-SQL code samples actually work!In a backward sort of way, this book will prepare you for exams 70-175 and 176 because you'll reference Microsoft's documentation so often to correct errors in the text that you'll know your subject by the time you've worked your way through the book.Two stars for the review outline, but there's probably something better on the market."
4,Good but not quite good enough,"This book is very good and helps you learn VB but it isn't complete enough to pass the test. I used this book solely the first time I took the Desktop VB Test and got a 685 and barely didn't pass. I then bought the Transcender prep test and got a 871 today. So if you have both the Transcender product and this book and you should not have a problem. Chap 9 of the book WILL be on the 70-176 test. Also, look at the MSDN online help for Package and Deployment Wizard. Know about the Data Report also."
5,Another Hawhee winner,"I used Howard's VB5 Exam book to prep for that exam a few years ago and it was wonderful. So there was no doubt that I would get his book for VB6. I passed both VB6 exams with plenty of room to spare. The few typos do not detract from this book, I haven't found a book w/o typos yet. As before the only tools you really need are Hawhee's book and Transcender exams. Used together and you will pass. You will find similar comments from other reviewers below. Good luck!"
3,Good but not enough...,"I just passed 70-176 with this book and Transcender's practice exam. The combination was sufficient but the book did not cover the various app deployment scenarios thoroughly. Also, try to supplement the book's coverage of COM Component management and selection from another source. This book was weak in this area."
2,"Good packaging, poor product design and implementation","The cover, chapter organization with objectives, study strategy, and so forth, all suggest that this is a comprehensive, well thought out product. It is NOT!The actual text is a mish-mash that reads more like a catalog than a text book. The teaching aids were layered on top of a product that seems like a brain dump, not a planned, organized exposition. And the errors are very disturbing; they are littered throughout the text. Prepare to be frustrated by the poor continuity and segues from hell. Terms are often used extensively before being defined, as example. Much of the subject matter is assumed to be known in advance, so the presentation that is offered ends up being rather weak.I am looking for a better text! You should, too."
4,Good Technical Resource,Has errors when you can spot them you know your ready - passed 70-176 first try - no problems - best technical resource I have found compared to the others -if anyone else has better please let me know - i'm getting ready for 70-175
3,Beginners Beware,"Although very comprehensive and contextual structured, MCSD training guide is not tailored for beginners. The writers of this book assume that the student is quite familiar with Visual Basic. However, the language is very technical, inundating the reader with technical jargon without introducing basic concepts. Its exercises, although excellent for your more advanced learners, assume that the reader can already code in Visual Basic. Bottom line: The book makes to many assumptions, even for those familiar with Visual Basic."
4,Good book,"I 've passed both exams. I suggest use that book with a Transcender VB Pack with Flash. Flash does a good job. Chapters are cover thoroughfully the exam subject except Chapter1,12,15,16,17,. You can count on other chapters."
1,Which 4?,Can any kind soul tell me which 4 exams are covered by this book? it received only one star for lack of this vital information. Thanks.
3,"Excellent format and content, but too many errors","I loved the format and the content. There were too many errors though. If I didn't already have a strong knowledge of VB, I may have accepted everything this book had to say at face value, which may have resulted in examination errors. I recommend this book, but with caution."
2,The Guys that Wrote this Book are Retarted,"I read this book cover to cover. There are no less than 500 errors, omissions, typos, and contradictions in this text. However, the book does attempt to address all of the exam objectives published by Microsoft. It touches on the basic essentials and should be used as a starting point to do your own research. This book must have been written in about 20 minutes and proofread by a monkey, because it is quite inaccurate and hilarious in some cases. Be forwarned that if you plan to pass the exams you should not believe any information in this book, but just use it as a general guide. I cannot believe Microsoft approved it as a study guide. Some of the code snippets in this book do not even run. Good Luck, and Beware."
3,Good...Stops short of Great,"This is a good book if you have the time to go through every chapter. If you think you know enough on the topic and just want to skip around or to just study the exam questions at the end of the chapter - this is where the book falls down. The code for the examples or questions is not included on the CD or available for download. Many of the questions at the end of the chapters rely on the code from previous chapters. So if you want to learn advanced ADO, you might have to go back a chapter and do the previous chapter's exercises and that chapter may use other code from a previous chapter, and so on. I found this absolutely MADDENING.The book is all inclusive in it's coverage of the exam topics. It is also well thought out and easy to read. Inclusion of the code would have made this a great book for exam prep and reference."
4,Too Big ?,"This is a pretty good reference (I still have it and use it), but it is too big for the material covered. My bookshelves are overflowing (I have gotten rid of many GOOD books) and it is frustrating when a book is good enough to keep, but the material could have fit into a space half its size. Still, one of the better VB6 references."
2,Don't rely to this book for passing the exam,"First time I went to take the exam (70-175) I used Study Guide by Michael Lee and failed. I missed 2.8% to pass the exam. But the book so poorly covered the topics, that after the test I could not even remember all of the questions. I read the critics for this book, bought it, learned for one month, went for the exam again and failed. Only second time I missed more than 10% to pass the exam.I noticed that the people who passed the exam used the Transcender test and that could be the key for success. Or perhaps is still better to have much of programming experience. My experience: only this book will not make you pass the exam."
5,Quite a relief to pass the stupid test,"I passed the 70-176 test today and I don't think I could have done it without this book, as well as the Transcender sample tests. Read the book cover to cover doing most of the exercises. Then took all of the tests. The first time I took each of the three Transcender tests, I failed. This led me to more review, which led me to take the sample tests again. I was extremely nervous about taking the real test, but I did quite well, which leads me to believe that these certification tests represent 60 percent understanding of VB and some 40 percent of How to Take a Test! This book, Transcender, and some experience will help you pass. But it still is alot alot of work. Plan on heavy duty study for about a month. Do all of the exercises, answer all of the questions, highlight heavily, and when you are done, go back and thoroughly review all of your highlights. Know Package and Deployment and Debugging very, very well, and you should do fine. Good luck."
3,Beginners Beware,"Although very comprehensive and contextual structured, MCSD training guide is not tailored for beginners. The writers of this book assume that the student is quite familiar with Visual Basic. However, the language is very technical, inundating the reader with technical jargon without introducing basic concepts. Its exercises, although excellent for your more advanced learners, assume that the reader can already code in Visual Basic. Bottom line: The book makes too many assumptions, even for those familiar with Visual Basic."
4,Best book on the market,"I looked at a lot of books when I was studying for the 70-176 exam, and this books was by far the best. It is very comprehensive and thorough. This books contains very good exercises that you can code in your self. I passed the test last night and I owe a lot to this book."
4,"Excellent for 70-176, needs more material for 70-175","I passed the two exams at the first time. For 70-176 I used the book, and for 70-175 I used the book & Transcender."
4,Any other online discuss group on 70-176?,"I haven't taken the exam yet and this is the first book I am working on (thanks to commends at this site), so I really don't know how good this book is. Besides the misprints, typos, I found a serious mistake in Ch.6, Exam Question 8 (on form DeActivate event), choice B should be correct (in addition to choice C), you can test this from Exercise 6-1 of this chapter. Does anybody know of any online discussion groups on 70-176 and other MCSD exams? Thanks in advance for any info."
3,Too many pages ... you'll need months to get through it all,"however, it does cover all the topice. I thought I could use it as my only study guide, but it's just too big (too much information). Instead I ended up using it as a reference and primarily relied on the Transcender Flash and Transcender Exam products. Using all three methods, you're sure to pass."
4,Covers all exams objectives in details,"Buy it if you plan to take the test. It's well written, covers all exam objectives excellently, but it's rather bulky."
4,"Not perfect, but still the best","I almost stayed away from this book because of all the warnings about excessive typos. And they are there, but to me it really didn't detract much from the excellent teaching method consistent throughout most of the book. Having looked at quite a few others, I'd say this is the one to go with for the desktop exam. (I passed yesterday using this, Transcenders, and some of Exam Cram). You will definitely need to supplement this book with other materials (Transcenders is worth the high price) but I don't know what I would have done without Hawhee as my core reading. I hold back from giving it 5 stars only because of inadequate coverage of P&D Wizard. (Nobody else covers it well either. Everyone just walks you through it, but the test wants fairly extensive knowledge of the separate files.) All in all, however, I think if you're taking 70-176, Hawhee is superb, a must have."
2,Lots of mistakes and inconsistencies,"Both the book itself and the testing software have a lot of mistakes and inconsistent information. The text of the book says one thing, but the test answers say something different. Because of this I often had to stop, and research from other sources to find out whether the text in the chapters, or the answers from the review and exam questions was correct. And I've downloaded the errata from their website, and it covers some of the inconsistent information, but not nearly all of it. For a book that was published almost 2 years ago, you'd think they could put correct info out there to use.And their testing software apparently has no updates; but it has a lot of incorrect info in it also. So you may get a lower score when you take their tests than you should have received."
2,Very Good Content But Some Impossible Exercises,"Okay, this may seem trivial to the more advanced users, but the exercises in this book are deadly. They give the briefest of instructions and have no corresponding text on the CD! I mean, would it have killed the author to include the code so the reader can check his or her work? There were hundreds of megs of free space, but alas, no code to check your work! Forget the website, and e-mailing the tech support address at the site resulted in an automated response sent two days later! Arrrrggggghhhh! I dare someone of intermediate or lesser skill level to complete Exercise 4 without flinging the book out the nearest window! Good luck!"
4,The sample test is representative,"I agree with everybody else. This is a really good book to use for studying and passing the test. One thing I like is that the study questions are about the same level of difficulty as the real test. On the sample test I scored 869, and on the real test I scored 842. If you can pass the sample test, you can pass the real thing."
4,"Excellent, passed both exams on first attempt",I found this very thourough book exceptional but would agree with others that the software included is somewhat lacking though it does review exam concepts well
4,A Bit Too Much for Home Theater System,"First, there is nothing wrong with this amp. However, with today's speaker design, it is a bit much for the discreet seven channel home theater system unless you are trying to outfit it for a gymnasium sized room. I bought three of these because the price was right, and they work fine, but at the settings I'm using, at one quarter power, it's like putting a Hemi 427 V8 in a Volkswagen Beetle. The 100 watt version @ 50 watts per channel would have done fine. I also purchased the 100 watt version for the center channel speaker and it is more than adequate."
2,look elsewhere,"as far as the quality of the sound, its as others say. its decent for the price. however, the amp cuts out when the music volume is too low which can be extremely annoying. its particularly bad for classical music and annoyed me so much just now that it inspired me to write this review. i've read on forums that others have experienced this same issue. i'd spend the extra and get a better stereo amp somewhere else."
2,Stereo amplifier,"Not a bad item for its price. However, the sound quality leaves much to be desired. If you have a special ear for sound quality, this is not the item you would like to purchase. Your computer sound amplifier speakers would be much better. If you appreciate the bass-trebble definition and subewoofer fill, do not buy this....in that case, it's a waste of money!!!!!"
2,Disapointing,"We purchased this amplifier to drive a 5-ohm load based on the manufacturers claim of a low impedance 4-ohm capability. The unit arrived dead out of the box. Amazon promptly credited us and provided a return label. We purchased an identical amplifier locally because of time constraints. When connected to the 5-ohm load it worked but got extremely hot and we shut it down. We double checked the ohm load and it was 5-ohms. We returned the amp and purchased a completely different amp in slightly higher price range from a different manufacturer. The new amp worked fine. The audiosource is OK for a basic, small 8-ohm load and does not have the low impedance characteristics advertised by the manufacturer."
3,Confirmation of my suspicions,"For years I have been aware of a drive to replace the concepts inherited from the American Revolution -- blood was shed to separate us from the centuries' old battles indulged in by Europeans, that there were people who wanted us to go backwards,involve us in those battles, and Divine's book proves how right I was-am. Before reading Divine, I wrote my own version of that separation and now re-union, In the Presence of Our Enemies, listed on Amazon under my pen name, Ellen McClay, so it is nice to have confirmation from an authoritative source of how right I am."
5,TSUBO SHIATSU....WOW!!,"This is a wonderful self-study guide book that holds a wealth of information for the Shiatsu technique. It is easy to understand simply and is an excellent quick reference book.I was amazed that Kiyoshi clearly describes with detailed illustrations and clear comprehensive text. This book also includes interesting history of Tokujiro Namikoshi Sensei, the founder of Shiatsu, and his memorable events. Such as treating Celebrity Marylyn Monroe, and Athletes Muhammad Ali, as well as George Forman.TSUBO SHIATSU.... Must own book at home or office."
5,Next Book Club Selection,"Thank you,Ellyn, for putting into a story what many women have experienced. I could relate to the characters in this book. For years my group of 8 female friends, the Magnolias,met for Saturday morning coffee. Yes, we had all gone to see the movie. We cried when one was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, died, and served as her pallbearers. We were angry and supportive when husdands left two of our group.Ellyn has captured the emotions and feelings that women, who are truly friends, develop over the years of their history together. This book will be my choice for my book club, Women of Words,when it is my turn to make the selection."
4,Intriguing mystery and enjoyable women friends' book,"Really liked Riggs Park and would recommend it to o my friends. The story captivated me from the first and the mystery of what happened to Penny and wondering what Marilyn was doing having a face lift kept me turning the pages.The story shows that sometimes what we remember from childhood is very different from what actually went on.The flashbacks were a bit confusing at times, but I was able to keep up.Look forward to more books by this author."
2,Valuation of IT,The information and writing style is very old. Mr. Gardner need to doctor the book with modern language and new examples that are applicable to current technology.
3,Love this!,"I love the airy and sentimental feel - the first and the track entitled ""Beating"" have a chord progression very similar to Michael Jackson's ""Will you be there"" - Love it!"
4,Not for Young Children,"Haunting tale of betrayal that is truly frightening and powerful enough to render adults speechless and even tearful.Unlike many fairy tales, there is no happy ending. Indeed, that's the way life often deals out betrayals, but if you're looking for some fantastic escapism, this book won't do it. It is a bit like a fable from Aesop, but without the humor.I agree with one of my fellow reviewers who states that this would be good for older children. Might be a good way to broach the topic of cruelty, but the kids who are sadistic bullies and need to learn a lesson probably don't have parents who'd have the sensitivity to get this book.Rich, gorgeous drawings hold so much power that even the illustrator himself admitted to being taken aback when he leafed through a copy of the Chinese translation."
4,this book will break your heart,"This book will haunt your sleep and make you cry at night. It's about futility and betrayal and love and it is heartbreaking. It is not for small children. It is a beautiful, sad book."
4,Text format and features taught with flair!,"The author uses a very creative text format. The students love turning the book to read the words. The font truly looks like their writing and is very realistic to them. The color scheme in the book (I won't give it away) was very interesting. I didn't think that they would be able to infer what the red color symbolized, but I was wrong. The story was a little disturbing (my students love happy endings) but they were really excited to try writing a story that used this text format."
5,"Move over, 24...","...because the Brits do it so much better. Yes, the screenwriter has training in Hollywood, but the BBC and the fine actors show just how good this kind of show really can be.It doesn't get much better. Don't hesitate to own this series.BTW, it's up to Season 4 on the BBC, with major cast changes, but nobody appears to be complaining over there. I wish we poor second cousins were up to speed with our previous government when it comes to quality TV. As I've often wondered, perhaps we shouldn't have been quite so hasty dumping that tea in the harbor...."
5,MI-5 is Amazing,"I am currently obsessed with this series after having a friend turn me on to it. It's perfect for the summer when the rest of my crime drama shows are on hiatus.This also just might be the most realistic spy series ever produced. I have trouble sleeping (in a good way) after watching episodes. I would also add for those faint of heart this series is even more realistic and chilling in light of the tragic events in London this summer. Be aware of that. Also be aware that they are not afraid to kill off main characters without any of the ""very special episode"" hoopla of U.S. shows."
4,mi-5 doen't disappoint,"MI-5 was on PBS for awhile and I got hooked. It is a great show. And my favorites are these early series, when Matthew MacFadyen was still in it. I liked the later series too, but the best were the ones with him. Each episode has you on the edge of your seat. And you cannot have it on and do other things. Whenever I tried that, I had to just begin all over and sit down and pay close attention and have the sound turned up, because you really have to pay close attention to figure everything out and to know what is going on. I think our series '24' sort of followed this. They aren't the same show, but it does look like 24 came from many aspects of this British TV series. And these early ones have Jenny Agutter. I like Peter Firth - he is the charcter that stays consistent, as much of the rest of the cast changes in later series. Love the guy that plays 'Danny'. It's a great cast."
1,No Show,"Can't review it as I have not seen it yet - one month and 2 days since ordered, 1 month since they say it shipped."
2,Banzai Runner,"""Banzai Runner"" is without doubt a ""B"" movie with a definite ""made for television"" feel. But, it stars my Pantera - Cool! It's very predictable and full of corny lines, but lots of fun none the less. I expected a lot worse from what I had heard about the move, but I was pleasantly surprised. To quote my wife after we watched it for the first time, ""It wasn't that bad. We've seen a lot worse."" The chase and race scenes are fun to watch despite the lack of realism, and any car guy would love to own just about any of the cars used in the movie."
3,Banzai Runner,"This is a decant movie for 'car guys' who like fast cars racing around, even a little fun watching them work to build a car along the way but other people may find it a little weak on the plot. The only actual 'bad' thing about it is that it shows it's age, or rather the age when it was made (mid-80s). The sceens with the super-hot cars racing across the desart is enough to make it likeable for any car guy and seeing Dean Stockwell's reaction (ie. emergency pitstop) after his first trip above the 150mph mark in a tricked-out, low-riding customized pickup is worth a good roll in the floor for anyone with a sense of humor."
5,Terrific Technique,"Jonathan Talbot's book is small but it is packed with ""user"" friendly information on the creation of collage. His work is excellent and his instructions easy to understand. Reading the book inspired me to take his workshop. I'll carry what I learned from both into my own collage tapestry, weaving my imagination around his techniques."
1,collage,"I read glowing reviews of this book, so I bought it. I was disappointed, however, to find that the method requires special materials and tools. Nondeterred, I sought to track down the matte medium called for in the instructions, which turned out to be very difficult since I live in Japan and do not speak Japanese very well. After I triumphantly obtained the magic medium, I eagerly followed the guidelines for ironing the collage together, but found that my excellent and expensive Rowenta iron was not able to fuse the pieces together as demonstrated in Talbot's book. I ended up having to glue them, which is what I sought to avoid in the first place! To achieve optimum results, Talbot suggests using a special iron, which I am not about to buy, given my dubious results so far."
2,not what I expected at all,"I was hoping for samples of his work and ideas on how he creates his artwork. Instead it was a dry lecture on his philosophy of collage and how he approaches his artwork. Helpful perhaps to advanced collage artists who already have technique and style and are looking for a new slant, but totally useless to me!"
5,Best Game Ever,"I chose this rating because this game really is the original and I still like to play it. None of the other expansion packs, (Sims2 or Sim3) has Superstar which is my favorite."
5,Absolute nostalgia,"I had the original Sims for the PC when I was about 10 years old, on my old Gateway PC in the early 00's. I recently acquired the Complete Collection (minus the first disc, but I burned the ISO to a disc and now have it), and it's everything I wanted when I was a kid. All the expansions, all the fun!The music, the old townies, and even the Simlish brings back memories of staying up ALL NIGHT and playing this game because I loved it so much. I have since moved on to the Sims 2 and beyond, but I still load this up and play it often.The only problem I had with this were some errors where the game wouldn't recognize the first disc and wouldn't start up. But it has been fixed, and this game provides hours of nostalgic fun :)"
3,"Outdated, but what the heck.","This is an older game, outdated when compared to current games on the market.Still a fun way to spend your leisure time."
4,couldn't wait,"I'm 9 and I LOVE the game! It was difficult at first. In Magic Town there are fun duels, but if your guy is angry he/she won't do the duel. Also, you can build your own house. When you put wallpaper on, click on the wall and hit the shift button and unclick. BYE!!"
1,Pointless boring game.,"Lets simulate playing going to work, having kids, paying bills, eating food and going to the washroom.....OH THE FUN!!! This game sucks."
1,Bad Sims,"If you had a choice to go to prison, or play the game, you would probably have more fun in prison and the game has bad graphics. If you want to try the free trial on Sims Online, you will wait all night for the download and then it won't even work. It wont Be Fun at all. After you read this, you might want to think of a different game to buy and never buy sims."
3,sims complete,"I finally got bored trying to get many things to work at the same time, takes time indeed. Maybe I'm too hasty in games and this is not the one for me."
3,A graphics dinasour,"After having only known, played, and become a die-hard fan of The Sims 2, I bought this TS1 collection out of sheer curiosity. Boy oh boy was I surprised when I installed it. I never would have guessed the huge difference in graphics quality (or lack thereof) in this game in comparison with The Sims 2. I've never seen such a giant leap in game and graphics quality between game versions until now. I'm SO glad I already have The Sims 2, along with all of the expansion packs and add-ons, to keep me entertained, but this was at least worth the cost to check it out and to collect. It also comes with all of the expansion packs already included, too so that's a big time/money saver. I may fiddle around with this version a bit more in the future, but I'm quite thoroughly satisfied with The Sims 2 and it's hard to take such a big step backward graphics-wise and quality-wise and still have as much fun. So I'm only giving this 3 stars."
5,Wondrful game!!,"The Sims Complete Collection is a fun game with countless posibilities. go on a date with another sim, adopt a dog, turn your neighbor into a frog,or even create your favorite star and acully mack it famus. with all the styes, objects, and new game play The Sims Complete Collection is a great game and I strongly suggest it."
5,The most addicting game ever,I love this game it's a classic and an all time favorite. This game can get pretty addicting so be prepared to sit for hours building up your families and lifestyles. Recommended for those with lots of time on their hands.
5,Awesome!,"At one time I had collected all of The Sims 1 expansion packs. After a few years I sold all of them. So I bought this and it is awesome. Its a pretty good price for all of the expansion packs, totally worth it! Its fun to just play The Sims 1 after playing the Sims 2 for so long!"
3,sims collection,The games were fine but sims 3 seems much better even though I got the complete collection regular sims..
5,Dresses up a counter,"This is a nice item for the price. Solid and well balanced it fits spoons forks or ladels. Deep enough to keep splatters off the counter.It looks nice on the counter and matches my stainless steel kitchen. It is shaped so you can lay spoons down and don't have to just position them upright.Great item, nicely priced."
2,Chuck Murphy's Childrens Books Are Usually Entertaining,"I have purchased a number of Chuck Murphy's books for our child over the last 12 months. My son is usually amazed with all of the shapes and colors that are used in Chuck's books. This is an exception to those books which are always educational and entertaining. I would recommend you to examine and purchase some of the other books this author has published as the ""Big Trucks"" book is not of his usual standards."
4,"great book, but not worth $600","Steve Purcell introduced this limited edition sketchbook at Comic-Con in 2006. It has a lot of never-before-seen art and is a great purchase for any Sam & Max fan. This sketchbook will not be reprinted but supplies are still available and it sells new for less than $20 at www.telltalegames.com. Someday it may become a rare collectible worth the $600 some sellers are asking, but that day hasn't come yet."
1,Badly written and irrelevant.,"There's not much in this book that Lessing herself hasn't already said in her autobiographies and in interviews.Klein's obnoxious second-guessing at Lessing's decisions and how she's lived her life is unappealing. The few new facts she has dug up about Lessing are irrelevant. Lessing herself is far more interesting and impressive than Klein can ever hope to communicate in this badly written, even more badly edited, book."
2,not for me,I got this DVD to do on days I can't get to Zumba and was hoping it would be equally as fun. I guess I was unrealistic in my expectations. I didn't like the music and the steps were boring. I guess I have to spend the extra money and get Zumba DVDs.
1,beginners NOT welcome,"Colorful aesthetics, moderately fun and challenging steps. HOWEVER, the video is shot for watching NOT for participating. The timing fluctuates between cha cha, merengue and salsa without notice. Familiarity with each dance does not make it much easier to be successful following the format. Steps are often NOT to the beat. If you like being on beat and in sync with others...this is not the video for you."
5,Great fun!,"I just finished exercising to this and have to say its great! I have exercised for 25 years and am 45 years old and have to say that I work up a sweat when I do this and also learn salsa dancing which I love. Sstella is a great and very pretty instructor. Some people have said that they dont even break a sweatwhen they do this so I have come to the conclusion that they must be Olympic athletes. I have three of Stellas dvds and find that they are all great. At 45 I still wear a size 3 in clothing and I think the constant use of these dvds has kept the middle age weight off! I also do Turbo Jam, Boot camp and Joyce Vedrals workouts etc. Anyway this is great and I highly recommend it. Beginner to immediate."
3,Fun and Low Impact,"I've just started using exercise videos as a form of working out at home. I love to dance and this is one of the videos I picked up. The video is fun, but if you're looking for something to really get you moving, this isn't for you. This will be one of the videos I save for when I want a lighter workout. But nonetheless, it is fun and the moves are great. You just need to pep yourself up a little to get a sweat going."
4,Good exercise dvd and fun too boot.... makes you think you can dance.,I am not good at sticking with an exercise routine but I love to dance! I bought this and several other exercise dance dvds at the same time. Sure makes working out more fun....
5,"Sizzling Salsa with Stella Sandoval is ""Sizzling.""","I found the sizzling salsa DVD exercise video to be excellent. I exercise regularly, including walking, spinning, cycling, body pump, etc. But like everyone else I get too busy sometimes and can't get to the gym. I like exercise videos and actually use them. I have been taking body jam classes at the gym, which are not easy, and can really appreciate the sizzling salsa dance steps. Stella is very clear in her instructions and she makes it easy to follow the steps. The choreography is outstanding and the exercise group maintains perfect tempo. Please note the steps are difficult but Stella and her class make the movements look and flow easily. With practice I was able to follow the steps and keep up with the class. For such a good exercise video the background music is lacking. In Stella's next salsa video I would recommend better tunes!"
2,Dancing Salsa is a better exercise!,"I took ballroom dance lessons last year and I found the latin dances to be my favorite. I thought if Salsa which I loved the most is incorporated into exercise, it would be perfect! But when I started the DVD, I was very disappointed. The music was annoying and the steps were very simple, repetitive and boring. For me, dancing salsa with salsa music would be the best exercise and more enjoyable."
3,"Good instruction, but not as fun as the other Dance of the Inches series","I like Stella as an instructor, but this workout didn't have the same pizazz as the workouts led by Michelle Dozois and Maria Forleo. I agree with the other reviewer who found the moves repetitive. I also agree that this workout won't get you sweating. It's a good workout for a lighter day, or to pair up with another half hour DVD. As far as workouts go it is safe, will get you moving, and provides proper instruction, but it lacked the wow factor (for me, anyway)."
2,Not Really a Dance work out,"This video was a great disappointment to me. I no the latin dances and I was really hoping for an exercise routine that incorporated those dances into the workout. After all that is how it is promoted. With the exception of the cha cha move being slightly like the dance there are no real dance moves here. If you are expecting to see the Mambo, Merengue,Samba, and Tango moves they promise you will be disappointed. They are not there. Each move is just a slight variation of the next. In my opinion it is not at all what they claim it is, and it isn't a very good work out. I was very disappointed."
3,No inches came off,"I own quite a few exercise DVDs, and I purchased this one to do on my ""off"" days where I wanted a less strenuous routine. But this is too easy and I don't work up a sweat quickly enough. However, it is more fun than the usual, and the music is good. Plus, you might be able to use some of the moves on the dance floor. When I say, ""too easy,"" keep in mind that I am a middle-aged woman with 30 excess pounds to lose."
2,Sizzling Salsa,"I did not like this workout at all, if you want to call it that. I did really like the instructor, I just found the moves and music to be too repetative, and after about then ole' arms, I had had enough. I'll stick to the shape workouts for now because I actually want to see results sometime this year."
5,Classy sturdy sports bag,"Excellent bag. To last for years. It serves as sports bag, travel bag. It looks classy. I just love it!"
4,Does what it says,"If you are looking for a no-frills pre-amplifier that will deliver what it promises, this is it.No remote control, no digital read out, nothing fancy ... but it works and delivers good value for the money!"
3,SIMPLE IS GOOD,"This was just what I expected. A good solid control amp with no bells or whistles. A remote would be nice but the last preamp I bought with a remote, twenty years ago, was a Yamaha at $1100.00."
4,AudioSource Pre One/A Stereo Preamplifier,"Works as expected. Had no response from the dealer for extended specifications after inquiring several times. Wanted to know the power consumption and if the volume control was a true audio semi-log taper. The unit pulls 5.4 watts and does have a good audio taper, but had to buy the box to find that out. Many manufactures use a linear control which is wrong! The balance control is too close to the volume control. I've pulled the balance knob which leaves a gapping hole, but no longer tweak balance when intending volume. Balance should have been one of the smaller knobs like Bass and Treble and further from the volume control. Input select is lost with power down. The reason for buying the unit is to go green. Adding a 20 watt class-d power amp to the stack has reduced the idle power from the previous Panasonic VSX-9300 from 67 watts to 12 watts. Panasonic has been retired."
3,"A ""Good"" Book; Could Have Been Better.","THE GOOD NEGRESS would have gotten a higher rating from me if it didn't shift so much in time frames. First she's in the country, then she's in the city, then she thinks about the time that something happened in the country that was relevent to the present, and the story takes us back there, then stays. Then, we are back in the present, without so much as an acknowledgment of the transition. WHEW! Still, this coming of age story was pretty good. It felt like more of a filler during my downtime, but had enough to keep me interested."
1,Disappointed,"This book made no sense. One gets the idea, but then it is lost over and over with the way the author bounced from the time periods then back again so much so that one is pertually confused. The ending, well it is no ending, just another beginning that never got concluded as many other beginnings through the entire book. If this is the style and calibar of the authors writing, I will not be reading anymore books by her."
4,As always - the Inside Out series is outstanding,"I am always satified with the Inside Out Series, this book is very helpful for every level."
4,Sutherland and Baker reign in Handel!,"After last Saturday's Rodelinda MET broadcast I had to rush to this recording to recover from David Daniel's and John Relyea's wobbles and above all Renee Fleming's aggressive singing (who now sounds a lot like Bartoli).Sutherland and Baker are exemplary in the way they sing Handel music. They were both young when this performance took place and their gorgeous voices blend in beautifully! Countertenors normally sing the two alto parts nowadays but Margreta Elkins and Patricia Kern sound at home and sing with ease. The two male singers also do a fine job but nobody steals the spotlight from Sutherland and Baker.The sound of this recording is better than I expected. I didn't go through the entire score but I'm pretty sure this performance is cut.In any case, go for the much cheaper Opera d'oro release."
2,"poor source recording, I fear","Very, very uneven sound/recording quality. (Recording was taken live in 1959.) For instance, there's a part of the finale that sounds very much like the source tape sloooowed down and then sped up again. I also noticed during last night's listen that I could barely make out much of the harpsichord continuo, even after fiddling with my stereo settings. Unless you're a completist when it comes to one of the singers or a performance historian, you'll be better served with another recording."
4,Love my Gizmo!,"it's quite a detailed even down to the fingernails. I bought it as a gift for my husband. it was his favorite toy when he was 5, but had been lost during a move. he said it's an exact replica of the one he had as a child. I'm very happy with it!"
3,It's what you expect.,Don't feed it after midnight. Don't let it get wet. Good television adornment. It fails to sing and dance despite my repeated instruction.
2,gizmo,not bad for the price but i dont like the color of the hands ears and feet it was off from the picture i also notice a lot of glue around some of the ears mouth and eyes all and all not bad
2,Not what I ordered,I ordered a plush Gizmo for my daughter for Christmas. I got the dancing Gizmo. The dancing gizmo is listed for about $10 less than what I paid for the one that I thought was going to be a stuffed animal. I am not happy at all.
2,just a collectors item not a real toy... there can be only one.,"I ordered this with the idea that there were going to be 3 of them like it says in the description. There was only one. I was planing on giving one to my niece one to my friend who likes gremlins and keeping the other for myself. like I said there was only one when I received it I wrote Neca they told me that they would give me a refund if I returned it. I needed the one for a Christmas gift so I kept it. They were only slightly cheaper from the other sellers, and I would have wasted more to ship it back. Gizmo's ears are way too hard to give to my niece anyway. And I will just order me one off ebay after Christmas."
2,Gizmo Sucks!,"I am not at all satisfied. I originally sleceted a ""new"" Dancing Gizmo plush doll. I received a old, used, worn-looking Gizmo doll that does not dance or make sound as it advertised!! I would like a customer service rep get back to me. I would like to get a discount since I paid the regular rate price for a new dancing Gizmo doll!!!!!!!--Ceci Milian"
4,Very cute.,"The little Gizmo looks exactly like a slightly shrunk down version of one from the movies. I would have liked it if it has been more cuddly, since plastic parts are a bit hard to the touch, but it is a must buy for any fan."
3,Warning! This is the DANCING GIZMO!!!,"The doll looks alright, you can see the stitching around the mouth. Plus, nowhere on the description it says it is the dancing Gizmo. I thought it was going to be a full plush doll, but it really isn't. I was upset by the fact that it was the dancing Gizmo, the one i did not wanted, but i hate returning stuff. Oh well, i guess i'm stock with it."
1,misleading,The advertisement states an 8 inch plush doll and I got a 4 inch plush doll; I called the retailer and he said he hasn't had a chance to change the info on Amazon; yet it is still advertised as a 8 inch plush doll. I wanted to send it back but it would have cost more in S/H then the doll is worth!!! I am VERY DISATISFIED with my product!!!!!
3,Not as expected,"This Gizmo is super cute and it was shipped extremely fast. HOWEVER whoever measured it to be 8 inches tall must be using an Oompa Loompa's ruler. It is in fact 6 inches tall. I already had one this size, and would not have ordered another one if I had known it was the same. But if you are looking for a 6 inch Gizmo this is really great - but you could find it cheaper on e-bay... just as I did originally.."
4,Well worth it.,"We purchased this as a gift for our mother in law and received no complaints. If anyone would have complained, it would have been her. Great!"
5,Every Dog Enthusiast Should Have One,"Canine Terminology by Harold Spira is a timeless classic that every dog enthusiast should own. If you are the slightest bit interested in breeding dogs, showing dogs or just knowing about dogs this book explains clearly,concisely and with excellant drawings what all the terms that you will find in dog breed standards and show reports actually mean. It is written for all levels of knowledge in a non-patronising way that imparts knowledge and instills confidence in the reader and also shows a love and respect of the subject. This book is widely recommended by many courses on dogs, quite deservedly so."
5,Encyclopedia for doggy terms,"This book would be great for any pure bred dog owner to have around. I show my dogs and sometimes i'll hear a term being used by other fanciers who know a lot more than me. I may have to keep quiet at first but after checkng my ""Canine Terminology"" book for that term i can later join the conversation and pretend i knew what they was talking about the whole time. LOL ...this book i also great for understanding terms your vet may have used that you didn't understand. It's just a all around good book to have around for some one who is a serious dog fancier."
5,NOW I CAN ROLL,tHIS IS THE BEST THING THAT I HAVE BOUGHT. NOW I CAN GET TO THE STORES AND ENJOY THE OUTDOOR. I HAVE A PERSON THAT TAKES ME OUT.
5,Keep coming back to this constantly..,"I wasn't as enamoured with the Brit spoken word scene as everyone else was at the time, but Just Jack was the odd one out. In the beginning I mostly listened to it whilst I was bicycling, but soon fell deeper in love with the clever and witty lyrics. Today I regard it as one of my fav albums and perhaps one of the best albums from the 2000's. Yes, it's that good."
2,For Sartrists and Satirists,"You must have read Being and Nothingness if you are considering this book so I won't describe Sartre's scholastic interest in preliminary formal considerations; as usual it takes up 3/4 of the total work. Sartre is also an imaginative writer, however, and his analyses of group terror, top-ten lists, and respectability (in vol 2) almost make up for it. I find Sartre's apparent devotion to Marxism troubling in an ""objective"" philosophical work, especially since much of Marx is obsolete. In other words, I don't know why you would buy this book. It used to be tedious; now it's just interesting to specialists."
2,Not reliable,This product lasted less than two years. First one channel went bad and six months later the other receiver went out. They started to get static in the line tried to change frequencies to no avail and then the receiver would not receive at all.
5,Sweet sounds of classic jazz at its very best.,"In ""Tenderly"", Dennis Marcellino and Mark Stefani perform the sweet sounds of classic jazz at its very best.Dennis Marcellino's virtuoso saxophone performance is both masterful and passionate .Madeline Frank, violist,""In Performance"" and ""Madeline's Midnight Melodies"" cds www.madelinefrankviola.com"
3,Love is Alive - I Praise God,"I would like to say I love this CD, but I can't because I can't understand all of the words. I want to teach ""I Praise God"" to my choir for our upcoming Spring Concert. It's kind of difficult when you can't make out the words. In the future, include the words in your CD and cassette cover. It will help considerably."
4,There are some practical applications,"Even though this book was written for the military leader, it can still be used for guidance in leading any small unit. It follows along many management books that are already on the market, but this one goes a little farther in that those that it speaks of leading depend on each other for their very lives.Definately worth checking out if you have charge over a small unit."
4,Good tool for any leader,I am a battery commander and wish I had read this book as a platoon leader. This book is written for leaders of all levels from the new sergeant to a new commander.If you want to help yourself be a better leader and to figure out what you need to focus on...read this book.
4,SECURITY OFFICER,"A GOOD GROUND FLOOR BOOK FOR MEN & WOMEN LEADERS IN THE MILITARY.IT WAS USEFUL AS FAR AS PHILOSOPHY,BUT IT LACKED THE ADAPTABILITY I NEEDED FOR THE PROFESSIONAL SECURITY INDUSTRY,I SUPERVISE IN. Good Luck..."
4,Small Unit Leadership,Small Unit Leadership: A Commonsense ApproachThis book is a no nonsense aproach to leading small units and helps you spot problems before it starts or gets worse. It shows ways of getting the job done.
2,Little disappointed,"Was disappointed with this CD simply because it is more modern jazz than I care for. Oh well, win a few and lose a few. The price couldn't be beat and the service was very prompt. Item in excellent condition."
2,Not worth it,"Doesn't fit quite right (we have the same stroller the advertisement uses).Very flimsy, and does not stand up to any sort of wind (even the slightest breeze).Very disappointed!"
4,Good product so far,This has been a life saver to protect my babies lily white skin from the hot Florida sun. The only draw back I can see so far is that it kind of makes her stroller hot like a tent. Otherwise it has been great and allowed us to go for daily walks in the beautiful weather and get some fresh air.
3,Not what I was expecting,I bought the protect a bub sunshade because I have an umbrella stroller that's missing the shade canopy. I must not have read the description very well because I thought the protect a bub shade would be just what I needed... However it has to attach to an already existing shade! Oops! So I tried using it on my full size stroller and it just slid around everywhere. It was hard to keep it in place. I don't know if the material is just slippery or the shade is just to big. I'm a bit disappointed because it wasn't exactly cheap.
2,Navy not Brown?!,"Ordered the BROWN, NAVY arrived...returned it! If it was the right color might have kept it. Also wished the color options were more available in lighter colors like pink or khaki."
4,Protect a bub.... classic sunshade - excellent sunshade,I purchased the classic sunshade for use on my maclaren triumph on a Caribbean Cruise. It is a little big for the stroller so that when you tie it down it is not that tight around the top but this does not impact the overall functionality of the cover. It works really well and keeps my son nicely protected from the sun. I would highly recommend this product.
5,2 to 22 Days in the Rockies,"These are the best travel books we've ever used. They are easy to follow and offer very good tips. Although they were published in 1995, they are still the only books we use."
2,Better the first time around,"We had heard through the music grapevine that the Brothers Sardo were finally releasing some of our old drumming work almost 13 years later and, suprised, we thought it would be fun to discover how they would re-interpret the songs we put so much into.Gawd's, were we in for a suprise! Not only does it seem slow when compared with our current project, it lacks the power and majesty one will find in evidence by listening to the original 1986 version.Although we recognise our drumming, now laughingly attributed to Mr. P Sardo, much else in the way of crushing bone is no longer in evidence.If anyone would like an original mix of these tunes, complete with a photo gallery and a live rehearsal video, write to us at the address below.In chaos,Rasputin J. Svengali..."
4,GOOD READING,"Phantom Over Vietnam is the story of a Marine fighter pilot in Vietnam; his two tours, the time he spent in the USA between the tours and his thoughts about the war which are changing as he logs missions. It is a very good book for the military aviation enthusiast. I gave it 4 stars because the numerous flashbacks and various other explanations present all over the book sometimes makes it hard to follow. Moreover, I think that the author could have concentrated more on the "" cockpit stuff "". The epilogue, in which he evaluates his performance as a fighter pilot on a cost effective basis, is unique and quite interesting. I reccomend reading this book to anyone interested in military aviation or curious about what it was like to be a fighter pilot in Vietnam."
4,Another good Johnson album for your collection,"A lot of this material is old material that Eric re-worked, together with some new gems. The collection doesn't have the fire that AH VIA MUSICOM has, but these are basically ""sketches"" that he had that he felt might be appreciated by his legion of fans. There are a few numbers that are really good (his version of the Beatles PAPERBACK WRITER is incendiary). A lot of it is acoustic, but done really well. These are what you could call DEEP CUTS that show the depth of his talents. A lot of the tracks are not ""radio"" hits, but unmistakably intelligent, and would be appreciated by Johnson fans that want to understand his work from more than the angle of his ""hits."" I think you can buy it from his website, so don't pay the exorbitant prices shown here ($40?)."
5,"Another Gem By Austin's Guitar Virtuoso, Eric Johnson","""Souvenir"" is a most have CD for Eric Johnson fans and guitar fans. The eclectic 12 songs showcase Eric's acoustic guitar skills and mellow vocals in addition to many wonderful instrumentals. Most of Eric's CD's attract Steve Vai, Jeff Beck and Brian May fans because of EJ'S incredible tones. ""Souvenir"" is different and has a style similar to some of Steve Howe's finest solo CD's. Eric Johnson's riffs, dexterity and tones have been consistently brilliant for over thirty years. This reclusive guitar master is an ageless vegetarian who personifies all that's hip and talented in Austin. ""Souvenir"" is a timeless gem."
4,Wake Up People,"Those of you whining about this being a weak album certainly are stupid AND lazy. There are samples of the CD RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON. All you had to do was click on them, and MAGICALLY, sound will come out of your computer speakers, thereby allowing you to ACTUALLY HEAR WHAT THE ALBUM SOUNDS LIKE.As for the CD, yeah, it's a departure for Eric. So what. Since when does he have to do what you think he should do? And for that matter, the wanker who said it's a Hendrix tribute CD must be deaf too. Let me know when you become as famous as Eric Johnson. Loser."
5,A Hysterical Look at Love,"The ability to identify with the characters is amazing, and the comical way Hunter and Annalee misinterpret each other's situations can only be likened to true life."
3,Stalin's bloody war against the Poles,The joint invasion of Poland in September 1939 by Russia and Germany set in motion 50 years of disaster for the people of Poland. Hitler's crimes are well known. What is far less well known is that millions of Poles also were killed by the Russians. The famous Katyn massacre was a part of a campaign of mass murder. Millions of Poles were deported to Russia from 1939 to 1941 to serve as slave labor. When the Poles rose up to fight the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944 Stalin stopped the Soviet armies and let the Germans slaughter them. I have a list of other examples political terror and mass murder on my profile.
5,worth it for whiskeytown and bright eyes,"great tracks all around, but ESPECIALLY the song ""Choked Up"" by Whiskeytown and the song by Bright Eyes that Conor Oberst recored just for this record. FANTASTIC!"
1,Not really Lost Highway,"In case you're a bluegrass fan, be aware that this is NOT the bluegrass group Lost Highway, but instead a rock compilation being advertised to bluegrass fans such as myself under what I consider false pretenses."
1,rip off,"The picture of this products show a different article.It very small, only last for two aplications.It's a rip off.The perfum smell great, the beast, but this is a sample, they should'nt sell it, this should be a free sample."
4,Loved it,"If you like good old fashion piano music and a chours, this CD is for you! Mrs. Mills plays the piano, has a chours and sings! I really enjoy listening to it."
5,This is the best Indian Romance I have ever Read!,"This book is the best American Indian romance I have ever read, I just borrowed it from the library and when I was on page 13 and 14, I couldnt help myself but I cried.... It is very touching....and I must confess, this is the first book that I read about Karen Kay...well, since I am very interested in reading about American Indians...I am going to read more of her books =) I fell in love with this book and I am very upset to see that it is out of print because I would want to have my own copy of this book to gain my collection of American Indians Romance... all in all, I am looking forward to read more books by Karen Kay =)"
5,A great book,"Ms.Kay, thank you for a wonderful book... my dad is a Cheyenne and he enjoyed reading your book""Proud Wolf's Woman"" (He saw me reading it one night) Even mom liked your book too...she is Norwegian... well, thank you for writing this book and also I should thank for my friend ChenDee for recomanding this book to me in the first place...my family is looking forward to read more of your romantic novels :) Wish you the best! Little Coyote"
5,Slam bang Gaelic,You need big speakers and a big venue to appreciate the sound here. It sounds the same in every room in my house and it sounds great. I'm a fan of Celtic music and this is one that I can play over and over again. I love this disc.
5,Wonderful!,"This lotion is probably the best lotion I have ever used! My skin is noticeably smoother and softer after the first use. Also, very fast shipping."
5,Because of Winn-Dixie Review,"I think this CD is the best! My favorite song is I've Gotta See You Smile by Leigh Nash. Also, Opal's Blues is pretty good,too."
3,Disappointment.,"I thought that the movie was pretty good. The music is what made the movie. However, as a Dave Matthews Fan, I hoped to see at least one of his melodic jams on the soundtrack. I could replay that scene in the pet store for hours just to listen to that little jam of Dave and his guitar."
3,Where is Dave?,"Honestly... awesome music in this movie! Where is it all - why isn't it on the soundtrack? Isn't the point of a soundtrack to put the music from the movie on it? Dave Matthews even said himself in an interview, he wishes at least one of his songs would have made it. He specifically mentioned ""Butterfly."" Dave Matthews was the musical influence for this movie. There's no reason he shouldn't have been on this disc. Also, one of the most popular songs from the movie, ""Sunrise"" by Nora Jones should also have been included. I like the music they picked, but it by no means is a complete soundtrack of the movie."
4,Like them,"No problem with shipping or packaging. Good sturdy product, expected of a Kohler product. It's a little funky that you can see a bit of the screw when it's completely assembled, but wouldn't make NOT buy them again."
5,Beautifully designed & sturdy shelf!,I love the look of this shelf. It's made of gorgeous thick glass and hardware. I would definitely recommend this shelf to anyone.
2,Not the best choice,"Rampal has the most beautiful playing style I have ever heard. Unfortunately, he wastes it here on Gershwin and Joplin. Those pieces are excellent in their own right, but they weren't written for flute, and for good reason. Even so, they might be okay on an album comprised of music within the genre, but there is no discernible common thread to all the pieces on this CD. If you want Rampal, there are plenty of other options; my personal preference is the ""Best of Jean-Pierre Rampal,"" which also has Faure's ""Berceuse"" (one of my favorites), Vivaldi's ""Il Cardellino,"" and Bach's ""Sicilienne,"" along with several other gorgeous classical pieces."
5,This DVD works miracles! Thank you Joel!,I have owned and used this DVD for three weeks and it is truly transforming my whole body even my squishy post-child bearing body and I have been out of the gym for five years. Is running after two children exercise? Well that has been the extent of it and this DVD is changing that. I can do the workouts in my pajamas and no shoes at anytime of day. After only three weeks I received compliments on my arms in a sleveless dress over Thanksgiving weekend in Key West. Whooo-hooo. I highly recommned this DVD for all shapes and sizes and fitness levels. Joel's instruction is fun and motivating too.
1,a waste of money,This product doesn't work at all. It's suppose to deter birds looks like more nested in the bushes and trees of my property.
1,Worthless,Put this tape in various areas where a woodpecker was drilling holes in our siding. The next day he was back and drilled a hole right next to the rows of dangling tape. Couldn't be less satisfied!
4,A nice listen,"From what I understand, Jill Day was not a big star even in the United Kingdom. But listening to this CD, I have to say hers is quite a pleasant voice. Many of the songs on here, as was typical of British recordings in the 1950s, are covers of familiar songs I know in versions by American vocalists, and familiarity alone makes me prefer the US versions. But I must point out that even in those cases, I enjoyed her versions.Add this to the list of collections of British artists I'm getting to like listening to."
2,Not as good,"This unit working OK, the blade is terrible its rust after 1 month, and broke after 2 month. It stills under warranty but I can find the company or replacement anywhere in web."
2,Poor sound,"The CD I received through Amazon does not sound as attractive as my LPs. I expected the Cd to have been manufactured by RCA or Sony, but it was manufactured by ""Castle Communications (Australasia) Limited"". The seller should have pointed this out, certainly that it was manufactured in Australasia."
5,the Phantom Of The Opera At The Royal Albert Hall [Blu-ray],"WORTH EVERY PENNY.THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. I just bought this blu-ray and,this performance is the best show yet. Ramin Karimoo and Sierra Boggess are the best Phantom and Christine. The end of the is also worth seeing Sarah Brightman and Peter Joback, John Owen-Jones, Anthony Warlow, Colm Wilkinson former Phantom's sing. Thank You Cameron Mackintosh. You can buy this blu-ray now on Amazon U.K."
3,Too bad,"The spectacle for the taping of The Phantom of the Opera is visually great, however Karim Raminloo, although he shows his effort and stron performance, his tendency to make a hissing sound between breaths can be a minor distraction/annoyance."
5,WOW!,This is without doubt one of the finest Blu-ray discs I have purchased (and I own hundreds!). I could not believe what I was viewing and hearing. I have always loved the music but had never seen the musical and am very grateful that a friend recommended this Blu-ray to me because I am still in awe (just watched it last evening). Perfect example of why Broadway plays & musicals should be filmed for those of us that cannot get to New York to see them. A stunning production!!
5,Best Phantom!!,Absolutely LOVE this staged version of Phantom!I had never heard of the two main stars..and having seenPhantom 9 or 10 times over the years...I have to say these twoActors playing Phantom and Christine..are the BEST I have ever seen!You feel like you are actually THERE! Front and center!! Crank up the volume and ENJOY!!
4,"almost perfect, except needs a photosensitivity label","I'm used to adapting to my world, and not having my world adapt to me but I felt a little ambushed by this movie. I'm a long time fan of Phantom, so I knew the key points to expect trouble for my photosensitive epilepsy. The problem in this case was that the lighting effects in this version tended heavily toward strobe - even at points I wasn't expecting. I streamed the movie as a rental, so I just dropped the movie at the key points. However, I found myself rapidly spinning myself out and around or slamming on minimize at multiple other points completely out of the blue. That meant I was missing entire sections (although I at least got to hear them.) One would think with the recent news stories about seizures and movies people would begin to think things through. I guess it's just going to take some time."
5,Espectacular Production,Cameron Mackintosh production for this 25th Anniversary with the talent of Andrew Lloyd Webber is amazing. The longest production on the West End and the Royal Albert Hall as the main scenario is exciting along the video.
5,Beautiful production,I am thrilled with my purchase of the cd Phantom of the Opera. It was filmed in the beautiful venue of Royal Albert Hall. It was like I was right there watching it. BRAVO! BRAVO!
5,Phantom of the Opera,What an Amazing feature! It is awesome. I highly recommend it! It was received quickly and as advertised!The added bonus features added great enjoyment!
5,Excelente,"Me encanto, la puesta es genial, los protagonistas espectaculares, fue la mejor versión del Fantasma que he visto hasta ahora! Me hubiese encantado haber podido disfrutarla en vivo!Altamente recomendable!"
5,"Gorgeous, Well Done & Most Importantly Well Cast!","I purchased this for my husband who is a die hard Phantom fan and has seen the show 8 times with various different casts. We initially rented this from RedBox and fell in love with it. In my opinion, when they put together the Phantom movie and other various anniversaries, they kind of miscast some parts and it can be a let down. In this production, Sierra, Ramin and Hadley are PERFECT!! Casting was well done and the costumes and staging are phenomenal!The extras on the DVD are great too. This was a great gift for my husband and he has been obsessed with it even since I got it for him!"
5,Totally Awesome!!!,If you love Phantom you will love this. Not only do you get an amazing performance of the Opera but you also get to see what they did after the performance. Sarah Brightman comes out and sings with many of the past Phantoms.
5,A WONDERFUL & TIMELESS CLASSIC!!,This movie is AMAZING!! The music is awesome as well! The actors and actresses are also perfect for their parts! Great casting!!!
5,Phantom of the Opera + Love Never Dies,"= Amazing day watching Andrew' masterpieces.If you love POTO, but this, you won't be dissapointed.And I love the sequel too, but you know, the sequel is just Webber' vision of the story (Phantom & Christine romance), so watch with a free mentality."
3,Not my favorite Cast,Wasn't my favorite cast. I don't feel that Ramin Karimloo is fit to play the Phantom. It's just not suiting for him. I do not like Sirra Boggess as Christine at all. She is not able to hit all the notes and she forces a lot of them that are out of her range. Hadley Fraser as Raoul and Liz Robertson as Madam Giry just weren't doing it for me either.I would of given it 1 star for the cast and 5 for the musical ... thus making the 3 stars it stand at now =/
5,Awesome!,Amazing production. Andrew Lloyd Webber did it great again! This celebration of the 25th anyversary is exciting! I love it.
5,Phan-Tastic!,"Although it seems that everybody has their favorite ""Phantom,"" however, I think this is one of the best productions of ""Phantom"" that I've seen to date. The quality is outstanding, and the acting is exquisite. It is wonderfully adapted for viewing at home, so much so that one almost feels like you are sitting at the Royal Albert Hall watching it live. I would highly recommend this to any ""Phantom"" fan."
5,Amazing,This is the full play in the Albert Hall with so much technology effects. The performance is shine and in the end you can see a only moment with Sarah Brithman. Only opportunity to see the Phanton of the Opera outside of the Broadway's theater with so much color and technology. Simply perfect!The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall [Blu-ray]
5,Phantom of the Opera and Royal Albert Hall - Speaks for itself . . .,The Phantom 25th Anniversary Concert was a fantastic Celebration Program for the Ages . . . the singing and the acting were Top Notch . . . I Highly Recommend this wonderful show.
5,Come to the Opera,"This version of ""The Phantom. . ."" is exceptional. The presentation is beautiful. And the extra material with the persons who have sung the role of the Phantom and Christine is worth the whole video alone. Don't miss it."
5,thrilling,"beautifully sculpted, sound and visually great! It was good to see the other stars from this production also, a real plus."
5,Amazing!!,I watched this is Vegas and fell in love with the music. Saw the dvd and just bought it on impulse. No complaints... The music and singing and acting are superb. All characters were amazing!
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"I have loved ""The Phantom of the Opera"" since I read the book many year's ago. I have seen a few screen versions which I liked, but when I saw this version on PBS, I fell in love all over again! Since purchasing it, I have watched it numerous times and have loaned it to friends (who have now purchased it as well). Unfortunately I have never attended a stage version, but I hope to visit New York City to see it on Broadway. Excellent production as well as a superb cast! Ramin Karimloo, Sierra Boggess, Hadley Fraser to name a few! And of course Andrew LLoyd Weber is a musical genius! I highly reccomend this fantastic production!!!"
5,Phantom of the Opera Royal Albert Hall,"If you like the play, you'll enjoy this DVD. It is very entertaining with a spectacular cast, and the audio is excellent."
4,Next best thing to live,Of course Phantom is so amazing live but we are so glad to have a better option than the movie version. Will watch it again and again.
3,Cut my favorite moment,Just got in an import CD as a gift (both the DVD and CD won't be available in the US until 2012) and my favorite moment from the concert was cut from the CD - the Sarah Brightman 'Phantom of the Opera' -with the Phantoms from Around the World - was cut from the 'Grand Finale' number. (Though ALW's long speech and 4 minutes+ of audience applause was left in - shame!) Hopefully this number will be present on the DVD/Blu release.
5,WONDERFUL!,I saw this live on Oct 2 and it was stunning. The set design was brilliant and the acting was supurb. I adore Sierra and Ramin as Christine and the Phantom. They're the best since Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. I was disappointed that Michael Crawford didn't sing with Sarah Brightman. It would've made it that much more special. This is a spectacular musical and a timeless story that will live on long after we're all gone.
5,The PHAAAANNtom of the Opera is there.... inside your head. And will be forever after watching this!,"Amazing production of the Phantom! If you are a Phan you will LOVE this DVD. The Phantom is captivating, Christine is exhillerating, Raoul is amazing and La Carlotta....well she's La Carlotta. Whether you are familiar with the story or not this will make you want to go to NY or London and see it live. And then watch it over and over again. The music is spectacular. Probably one of if not THE best of ALW."
1,unstable picture,"I love Phantom of the Opera, but this copy does not play steady, it has a flutter.....tried other DVD's that I have and they seem to be OK......should I send this back....???"
1,Not impressed,"I watched this Royal Albert Hall version on TV during the local PBS fund raising campaign. I have see Phantom twice at the Curran in San Francisco and listened to the original CD hundreds of time. I have heard many different voices in the lead parts. The three leads at Royal Albert, singing Christine Daae, the Phantom and Raoul were disappointing. To my ear, Lisa Vroman is by far the best Christine, even better than Sarah Brightman. Franc D'Ambrosio does the best Phantom with Michael Crawford a close second. No wonder the SF and LA runs went so long.The acting is very artificial, maybe due to the use of close-ups. Live theater, even from cheap seats, is much better and gets stuck playing in my head. The various singers/actors performances are available on YouTube by bootleg video. Even bootlegged, Lisa Vroman is the best."
5,Just incredible music.,Just an incredible performance by a full cast!! Amazing sound and picture quality. This is a disc I wanted for my permanent collection.
5,Wonderful,Took me back to sitting in the theatre and watching this amazing play. This is a beautiful DVD. It is an amazing value.
5,"Phantasic Production, A MUST SEE","This is a Phantastic production of the actual ""STAGE"" performance of the most successful stage show in history. You are drawn in from the opening curtain. The camera work, colors of the costumes, the score, the songs & vocals, the staging, the acting, every aspect of this performance is TOP NOTCH.If you have seen the ""Phantom"" in person, this is the next best thing to being there. If you have never seen the ""Phantom"" and have ever wondered if it's worth seeing, wonder no more. It is."
5,Fanastic Production,"Having seen ""Phantom"" four times over the years it was touring, it was and will always be my favorite musical. I was not overly impressed with the movie, but I purchased this having liked the DVD version of the Broadway finale of ""Rent"". I have to say it exceeded my expectations. My only complaint, and it's minor, (SPOILER ALERT!!!) is that the chandelier was stationary above the audience, but I will assume that had more to do with the venue than the production.The curtain call with Sarah Brightman and the four actors who had portrayed the Phantom in various productions was another wonderful surprise."
5,Really outstanding!,I was expecting something good but this event was really Amazing. They did a great job with the BD. Image and Sound are awesome! Do not hesitate to buy this. Wait to see the surprises in the Finale!
5,Magnificent,It was just like being in the front row center of the Royal Circle in London without the uncomfortable seats. Truly magnificent. A must for Phantom fans.
3,Not great...,It is not the actual show but a concert... I think you better skip this item. Waste of money as I see it
5,Love it very much!,"I love it very much!! I have tried to sing"" wishing you were somehow here again"".Love Sierra's performance and her voice. Great show!"
5,childhood favourite,"Cosmic Christmas was a favourite of mine as a child. I waited each year to see it, checking the tv guide to see when it would be on, watching it every chance I got. Haven't seen it in years and was glad when a friend told me it was available here at Amazon. Now I'll be able to show it to my neices and nephews when they come to visit!"
5,A Cosmic Christmas,I saw this animation classic as a child. I would search the TV guide every christmas becuase it would be played on Windsor CBC. It is a wonderful Christmas special for kids and adults.
4,OOPS!,"you know, im sure the cards are great and all, but i have a hard time telling. thats because these are JAPANESE cards. i feel kinda silly that i didn't pay attention to the picture and description. if you can read japanese, get these ones. if you can't, i would reccomend NOT buying the 35$ that other companies are trying to sell. i guess the only thing i can do now is take out the duplicate cards (of ones that i have in english) and use those. :(."
5,Love the ducky,"I had been searching for these forever since my old one failed after 10 years. Strong, easy to handle, and fun!"
2,Disappointment!,"I ordered this book on a recommendation from a Bear shop. I was very disappointed, as it was written in 1964 and the bears are all very old fashioned. I was also hoping for some design tips, but find this book sadly lacking in this area."
5,fabulous selection of jill's music,"This is a must-have for any self-respecting musical connoisseur. The genius of Jill Sobule transcends the genre of singer-songwriter and steps away from anything considered the ""norm"". This disc is the best of the best and I highly reccomend it to everyone. Good storytelling is so rare a commodity these days. Thankfully we have it in Jill."
4,Fun Fun Fun,I can never get enough of Jill's witty lyrics and melodies. This album is a must have for new and long time fans alike. Long live the Cult!!!!!!
4,Interesting reading,"Some of the fiction is way out there and hard to understand but for the most part it's interesing reading, some really great stories, quite a mix"
2,Don't buy this if you want the original version of Car Wash!,"I don't know who the lead vocal is on this, but it is NOT the same version I listened to in high school. I thought I was careful when I was selecting files for purchase. But I definitely goofed on this one! Be sure to listen to the samples carefully before you buy."
1,Another Unhappy Person,"I too also purchase this cd for the song Tonight is the Night/Won't be Long Now, but it is not on the cd. Somebody needs to correct the track listing because it is misleading. The cd has 12 tracks not 13.Passion & Compassion"
4,Very good Merchant,"Item was as advertized and was delivered in a timely manner. thank you,I'll Be Back."
3,Something's Missing,"As a lont time Gilder and Sweeney Todd fan I am dismayed to find a lot of material missing, especially one of my Gilder favourites ""Here Comes The Night"". Whoever did this compilation on Nick's behalf should be fired and given a job as a plumber (my apologies to all plumbers). Once again, die-hard fans have been short changed."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN AN 80-MINUTE ANTHOLOGY...,"... Nick also recorded some great overlooked stuff in the 80's (""Let Me In"") that could have been included... it's hard to believe that almost 30 years have gone by since ""Hot Child In The City""! Weren't those the golden days of radio?"
4,"Great place to start, but...","I have to agree with the general tone of comments in this section. It's a great way to check Gilder out if you're interested, but us long-time fans just have to wonder why more of his great late 70's albums aren't available in full. ""You Know Who You Are,"" ""City Nights"" and ""Frequency"" are all stellar albums chock full of great tunes, and this little 12 song comp barely scratches the surface! Still, I can't NOT recommend it, as every song on here is fantastic. I just want more! If you're only familiar with ""Hot Child In The City"" and want to hear more, I recommend the rocking ""Got To Get Out,"" ""She's One Of The Boys"" and ""You Really Rock Me."" By then you'll probably download the rest anyway... Lastly, I also agree with others who have lamented the omission of ""Here Comes The Night,"" how could that have happened?"
5,It has Hot Child in the city doesn't it.,"As a greatest hits album this CD is a winner. It contains all of Nick Gilder's greatest hits: Hot Child in The City, to name a just a few. This is the perfect compelation for everyone who loves all of Nick's Hits like Hot Child in the City. If you like Hot Child in the city or just Hot Child in the City this is the album for you!"
1,Inferior collar,On my first attempt to use the collar it came apart. I e mailed Amazon and they promptly authorized return of the product. One star for the collar and five stars for Amazon. I would not recommend this collar to anyone.
4,Compact and handy,"The TI-25X is a nice handy calculator - small and light enough to take anywhere. The thing I liked the best was the fact that it needs no batteries, yet can run off the solar panel in very low light. Other ones I tried needed nearly direct sunlight to work, yet this one works in almost any room light."
1,Display went bad,"It worked OK for a while, hence the 1 star. But after a year or two, the vertical bars that make up the display in the 3rd and 5th positions from the right disappeared, so you do not know what the numbers are in those locations. The calculator is now useless. And I'm afraid it will end up in the electronic waste."
5,Absolutely amazing!,This album certainly did not disappoint. Love all of Felipe's work. He's a fantastic musician.
2,Ethics Class,"Although Mike is my teacher at la roche college, I do have to say this is a hard book to understand. My class has confronted him about it and he said that he will try to put it in simpler terms for the people that aren't quite up on the asian terms and culture.HEY MIKE- INCLUDE A DICTIONARY NEXT TIME!"
2,Something is very wrong here,"I understand these things are machine built, but they need to watch the process more closely. I had burrs in the wheel that had to be filed down, some of the spoke nipples where mushed and mangled. I would say the QC department was sleeping on this one.It gets 2 stars because it is a cool looking rim and goes great with my black and chrome bike."
3,"Bright Boulevards, Bold Dreams","I enjoyed this book. It provided some insight into the Black Hollywood scene from its humble beginnings through the 1950s. Since I'd previously read books about Stepin Fetchit, Hattie McDaniel, Sammy Davis, Jr., Ethel Waters, and Dorothy Dandridge, Bogle rehashes alot of information that I already knew. He did, however, talk about some of the lesser known stars like Herb Jeffries, Madame Sul-Te Wan, Fredi Washington, et al. Bogle also talks about the wonderful contributions of architect Paul Williams - someone who I'd never heard of but would love to find out more about. We get to read about the famous Central Avenue and its smoking clubs and swanky hotels. We get some inside dish on career breaking interracial relationships and some pretty detailed info on just how and where the Black stars lived. If you like Bogle's other works about Black film/Hollywood and its contributions to the entertainment world, you'll probably like this effort."
3,A quest,"Continuing the series of books in the universe of the League of Peoples, ""Trapped"" centers on a group of friends living on a post-apocalyptic Earth, which is under the control of the temperamental Spark Lords. Phil and his fellow teachers at a third-rate private school find themselves involved in a quest to save one of their students from a powerful entity whose intentions are unknown, but it certainly can't be good, what with all the dead bodies in its wake. All is not what it seems with the Spark Lords, because they have knowledge of this entity but they won't share, but then, Phil and his friends aren't what they seem either. Gardner's vibrant style is here, but it comes out muted. And as the book progresses, the plot feels more and more contrived. I like how elements of sword-and-sorcery fantasy were blended with science fiction, and Gardner's sense of humor is always great, but overall ""Trapped"" isn't as great as his other books. Still worth reading, but just don't expect much."
2,Couldn't keep me interested (or awake),"""Trapped"" follows a group of university professors who investigate a student's death and another student's kidnapping.The prose is quite well written, and the plot has interesting developments. The universe (a future Earth with fallen technology) is interesting, though the ""we're so much better than you"" aliens get pretty annoying. My biggest probem was that the pace is really slow -- rather like Dune or Moby Dick -- padded with lengthy descriptions of scenery & people & monologs on semi-related events.So, not my cup of tea, but nicely written and suitable for those of you who enjoy liesurly books."
3,What happened? -- Numerous Errors,"What happened? David Geary’s books on the AWT and Swing are excellent and stand above all others. But this book was clearly rushed with numerous errors. For example, consider the EnforceLoginTag in Chapter 9. Geary's TLD defines the errorPage attribute as optional; however, if you don’t specify an error page, the custom tag fails miserable because Geary tries to set a null attribute on the session object (illegal by the API). This technical error is very hard to debug.On the other hand, this book is full of great ideas. The material addresses how programmers are tackling real JSP issues in industry. The ideas alone will save you the... investment. Just be cautious of errors."
4,Advance implementation... not for beginner,"This book is definitely the best(at least for me), providing many designs, and implementation of JSP that we can't find in any other ""Core JSP"" books. It will be perfect if you finished one of those ""Core JSP"" books before started this book. I read the ""Web Development with JavaServer Pages"" before I started this book and find no problem to catch up this book."
5,In depth,Excellent in depth coverage of JSP's. This book does a very good job of explaining the architecture of a good JSP website.You will need an understanding of JSP's first. This book doesn't explain how to use a 'useBean' tag.
5,"Stoney Point Telescoping Explorer, 25-60""",I bought this monopod for hunting Whitetail in North Central Idaho. I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes to use a walking stick that doubles as a shooting stick. The posi-lock adjustments work great and are very stable. You can use this length of stick when sitting or standing. If you like still stalking spooky bucks that require quick snapshots this is what you want. In most of my stalking situations Bipods take too long to set up. I also find myself using this to stabilize my binoculars when glassing clear cuts for long periods of time. I have used other shooting sticks and this tops them all.
2,Misled,"I ordered this book as a gift for my sister. We had Egermeier's Bible Storybook as children, and she wanted a copy for her grandchildren. My purchase was listed as being ""new"", however the presentation page was already filled out, so it could not be new. The cover was not as pictured, and the book smelled musty. While Egermeier's is a wonderful bible storybook, I feel I was misled by the seller."
3,"""Yeah Right"" is so Wrong!","I was very disappointed in this tune by Jonah. The lyrics and the beat are EXTREMELY repetitive. I believe that if you are going to have lyrics in a song, at least have more than just two words. The remixes really don't help it much, unfortunately. I would highly recommend buying ""Ssst...Listen"" instead because you get a good variety of beats & breaks, and better lyrics. ""Yeah Right"" is a terrible follow-up to it. Don't waste your cash! If my review was helpful to you, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
3,Charming and entertaining all the way...,"The only indisputable and exciting great element in ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" is its music...Clifton Webb does a fine work as the great band-master and composer of memorable marches who, on the 1890's, when he leaves the Marines Corps., forms his own concert band and travels around the world...With the sensitive and beautiful Debra Paget as the singer-dancer, and the sympathetic and good-looking Robert Wagner as the horn player, the loving couple shares a real and firm part of the 'imagined' tale...The great highlights of the picture are when a black choir is singing ""The Battle Hymn Of The Republic,"" and the outstanding performance of ""Dixie,"" played by Philip Sousa and his Orchestra as they enter the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta...With Ruth Hussey playing Sousa's sensible wife, and with vivid costumes and a rich amount of Sousa's music, this colorful film is charming and entertaining all the way..."
3,sousa`s march,. o colorido é muito bom .o filme parece ser uma copia de anterior.as musicas podiam ser mais longas .a cenas da guerra com cuba poderiam ser deletadas
2,Nostalgia better than original,"I saw this movie when it first came out and have remembered it ever since. Seeing it again makes me marvel at the music -- worth the price of admission. The plot, though, is corny. Clifton Webb is superb as Sousa. Too bad the movie doesn't show the rest of Sousa's life."
1,Don't buy this DVD,"I purchased this DVD entitled ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" as a birthday gift for my wife. I received it, tried to play it on my year old Sony Blu Ray DVD player and it would not play/load. I returned it via the requested procedure and received a 2nd copy. I also tried to play this one on the same player but with the same results as the first DVD. Nothing. I also returned this 2nd copy of the DVD and received a full refund. I do not encourage anyone to purchase this DVD as it is obviously defective."
5,ladybug,Excellent movie. Our family tradition to play this every 4th of July and our VHS tape was getting shopworn. Finally it became available on DVD!
3,Only for the complete collection,"If you're interested in the ""orphan lifestyle"" the book is fantastic. Great info on a true street-level game. However, it doesn't make the orphans more interesting or complex. No new character enhancements. Don't buy it if you're looking for a way to make orphans more appealing as a character option. Buy it if your looking for the harsh reality of orphan life."
4,One of the Best in a while,"Well, okay, you might get turned off by some of the content, thats okay, its the WoD, your supposed to be uncomfortable, anyways, it is very, very good, and may give you a brand new prespective on mage, like it did to me, buy it, read it, and you will begin to see Mage through Orphan eyes..."
5,Absolutely amazing!,"I 'grew up' with this album. (Music in a Doll's House)Then realised it was missing from my days.So I had to buy another copy.Of late I have been listening to it on the cassette player in the car, and realised it is one of the forgotten /overlooked classics of the period.I'm a musician of sorts myself, and as such, can say in all honesty that this album is up there with the very best.It has stood the test of time; it is musically very, very brilliant.It was **really** innovative in it's day, and now, --in 2004--, it is still really very original - and put together by REAL musicians, not the tripe that appears on most TV screens or radios these days!If you want to know what the very best of the late 1960's were all about, then get a copy of `Doll's House' and hear a genuine marvel.It was a tragedy that this band got passed over in the welter of events.They were just, plain terrific."
4,Cinemage by Ryuichi Sakamoto,Ryuichi is really great. Cinemage can show that!I heard him before in Wutherings Heights movie soundtrack only.Pure emotion!
4,A new--and live--orchestral recording,"Sony says: CINEMAGE consists of 'New recordings of Sakamoto's best-known music for film and television, including ""Forbidden Colours"" from Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence with vocal by David Sylvian, the Oscar winning theme from The Last Emperor, and ""El Mar Mediterrani"" composed for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. Sakamoto on piano is accompanied by a large orchestra in these new arrangements of well-known themes.'"
2,LIGHT IVORY IS PUTTING IT MILDLY,"NICE PRODUCT, BUT THE COLOR IS SO OFF! LIGHT IVORY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN CALLED CHALK WHITE. I NOW USE THIS TO MIX WITH OTHER FOUNDATIONS TO MAKE THEM A TAD LIGHTER. OH WELL."
2,"Concise, but Too Simplified","Come on, you need to know much more than what was in this book to be a structural engineer. I bought the 3rd edition right when it was fresh off the press to prepare for the NCEES Structural II exam in April 2006. I didn't take the Structural I exam so I can't say if this book is more tailored to that. However, I have to say I passed in spite of this book. The examples in the book are easy to follow, but for a good portion of them they only cover the easy special cases, not the more elaborate, more complicated variations. For how thin this book is, I think it is outrageously expensive. I was also disappointed that the concrete design aids are not updated to the current code with the revised factors.Another waste of money was the 2003 IBC. They took out all those useful sections from 2000 and just say refer to ASCE-7. You would be fine just to get ASCE-7 for the exam and save some money."
5,Finally......,"This is THE book to buy for the NCEES Structural I exam. There are so few decent books to study for the Structural I exam. I bought two other related books for my studies and returned them because they were garbage.This book is exceedingly concise, while at the same time, exceedingly thorough. If you only buy one book to study for the Structural I exam, this should be it! I was surprised at how thin this book is (only about 1"" thick), especially for the high price, but it is jam-packed with exactly the material you need to bone up on your topics. The material assumes a certain level of knowledge of the topics covered. It gives the essential formulas and references to the codes. The text, and figures are of high quality.Thank you for such a great book."
1,Disapointment,"Another reviewer said this was really needed, thus I got it. I wasted my money. I much prefer the adjustment tool that wcame with the planer as opposed to this. First, you have to attempt to find top dead center and mark it on the fence, then scribe the fence(I really did not want to scratch my nice new planer....). Finding exact TDC on an arc is not easy. In any case, after fiddling with it and ten checking the results with my gauge, it came out pretty sorry.I then reverted and used the gauge that came with the jointer and was able to adjust them all quickly and easily and they came out flat and the same. Thus, it now draws dust in the drawer... Anyone want to buy mine?"
4,I liked it!,"I liked the organization of this book- the ""tried and true"" names are first for each letter, followed by the ""slightly daring"" and ""living on the edge"" options. This allowed me to only browse the traditional names that I would consider for my child. I also liked the commentaries about the names."
3,Your very own 12 tiny Power Rangers,"I used to hate batteries. That was until I used these little babies! ""Stay back - I've got a Rayovac"" should be the tagline for these cosmic tripple-A (Alkaline AA) batteries. I used them to power some small electronic circuits I build (a hobby of mine) and these things last much, much longer than any other brand I've tried (and I've tried a lot!) Great value! ""You won't want your money back once you've bought a Rayovac!"" Keep up the good work boys."
3,What can I say,Really they are batteries. Nothing much to say. Used in all toys that required this size. They served their purpose.
3,not happy,"the book was not as detailed as i had hoped for . i had expected more from fred than this . plus it took 14 days to get dilevery on this book and i did not like that . the seller put down a very long dilevery time and from now on i will watch for that . it was my fault ,but his his mistake .when i buy a book it means i want that book and i feel 14 days to be excessive ...."
4,Munchkin Math Counting Money,"This was a great video for first graders, they went through how much each coin was worth, what color the coin was. Some of the songs were boring, but my first graders enjoyed this video"
2,GOOD FOR K-3,"SLOW,SLOW,SLOW. MY GRANDSON WILL BE ENTERING 1ST GRADE AND THESE 3 DVD'S ARE WAY TOO BORING AND EASY FOR HIM. THEY MIGHT BE OK FOR A CHILD WHO HAS NOT ATTENDED SCHOOL. MY GRANDSON WAS WATCHING THIS KIND OF STUFF AT TWO AND THREE YEARS OF AGE. A BIG WASTE OF MONEY ON MY PART. I WILL DONATE THEM TO THE LIBARY FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN."
2,Christmas story lamp,"Item turned out very well. Did not care that I had to glue the lamp into the hands so the figurine was complete. There was no indication That I had to complete assembly. My opinion will make no difference, if it was to come complete the item would cost more. I see very little use in this survey"
5,A Superlative Guide for working with multicultural classes,"This is not the typical ""let's celebrate Hanukkah, it's the Jewish Christmas"" kind of simplistic stuff you find in many curricula. It's a thorough, thoughtful and insightful exploration of the many ""cultures"" that children and parents and teachers bring to the school. It's the school as the central meeting place of various cultures in our society and how to deal with those cultures respectfully and not as problems but as resources, strengths and treasures."
4,"Ambient, soothing, different.","I received this album on MD a few days ago and have been enjoying it ever since. From the first three tracks, things seem to get progressively more experimental, going a little more conservative with Aqua, and the 4-hand wonder Tong Poo.Tetsudouin (Railroad Man) is a very poignant piano piece and that, along with Energy Flow, Aqua and Tong Poo are my favourite tracks on the album.It gets a little samey near the middle but other than that, it's quite good. Ryuichi Sakamoto is also evidently masterful at the piano, as well as technopop..."
5,sultry southern stories,"A Confederacy of Crime contains twelve short stories by writers who, even if they are not natives of the states below the Mason-Dixon Line, have managed to capture the Southern Style of writing. Plenty of crime, sex and humour, dressed up with grace and good manners, sultry drawls and steamy weather. The stories by Jeffrey Deaver, Joan Hess, Michael Malone, Margaret Maron and Sarah Shankman are especially delicious."
5,Excellent book for understanding neural network innards.,I took a graduate neural networks course with Dr. Hagan who used this book. The book analyzes the contemporary algorithms for neural nets and shows why neural nets work (and don't work). MATLAB examples are on the supplemental disk but they can be coded easily in other languages. The convergence toward a solution is shown using 2D and 3D plots.
5,Great book - well done!,I have been fortunate to take Dr.Hagan's neural network class and use this book as the text. He is (in my opinion) one of the most understandable authors on this subject (which comes from his vast knowledge of the field). The book makes use of clear examples and informative diagrams. I may have skipped a few classes (sorry Dr. Hagan) but I had no problem at all learning the material from this book. I now write neural net (among other AI schemas) code on a regular basis and still use Hagan's book as a reference.
1,"Bad quality, very thick.","I liked the 1st version of this book, and I thought that the 2nd version of this book would be better. However, the 2nd version is exactly the same as the 1st version. In addition, it has bad print quality, and it is very heavy because each page is very thick."
4,Amor a la Bachata,"Para los amantes de la Bachata, este Cd tiene que estar en su colection. Las canciones son memorables y vienen de nuetros artistas favoritos como, Alex Bueno, Monchy Y Alexandra, Junior Y Jorge Y muchos mas. Ordenalo ya."
4,Handy Dandy Grater,"I ordered this grater, on the recommendation of another user. I love it. The ""grate"" is fine,which my family loves for pasta and pizza dishes. It's not bad to clean, and I don't get hurt using it! It worked well on dark chocolate too!"
3,Good and bad!,"I usually dont rate reviews for products unless something exceptional good or bad comes my way.This product is a so so!PROS:1. It does what it says though...2. It is rather small in size and easy to store.CONS:1. It grates cheese VERY slowly. (Main function)2. It is not the easiest on the world to clean.Overall for a prime price I would expect a ""peachy"" product that is easy to use and works exceptionally well. I have since gone back to the handheld grater that works in a fraction of the time that the electrical takes and it is much much easier to clean!"
5,These books rocked!,"I adored these books. It's wonderful to watch the characters mature and develop over the series, in addition to seeing their relationship grow. Very colorful and entertaining. If you like vampire romances, you'll likely love these books. I know I did!! ;-)"
1,Jenni,"I am an avid reader, often 2 to 3 books per week and this book was less than entertaining. I stuck with it because I kept hoping it would get better. Romance, what romance? There was a kiss, a caress and then it was the next morning. The plot kept leaving me hanging. The main characters would be in some heavy situation against the enemy and the next thing you know it's the next day and their escape or an explanation never materialized. Very disappointing. I will not read the follow up!"
4,great book,"1st book in a series. Great book, lots of action, vamps, zombies, psychic powers, attraction between PI Nikki and vampire Michael. And read the 2nd book to, Hearts in Darkness for more of Nikki and Michael."
4,Kept the pages turning.,"Where I do not think Dancing with the Devil can be put on the same shelf as Laurell K. Hamilton and Tanya Huff's Blood series, it was still very good. The action - where definitely not as graphic as Hamilton's books - kept you reading - unable to say ""I'll read just one more chapter and put it down for the night"". After reading the last sentence I was glad to see in the next paragraph that there will be a continuation of Niki and Michael's story coming in December. A lot of things were settled, but there were a lot of things left dangling. I am looking forward to continuing the story to find out what happens with Niki and Michael."
2,"dancing with the devil ( Nikki & Michael, book 1",I was very disappointed with the book. I was expecting something along the lines of her 'Riley Jenson series.'I kept waiting for the characters to spark.I did not buy the sequel but I did move on to another series that she wrote.I love her style of writting and like the heat the books produce.
1,Boring,"This story line had so much possibilities but it went wrong fast. I got so tired of the angst between the two main characters. Pages and pages of angst in-between the pages of the stupid decisions to go into the dark tunnel with a train coming; go down the dark stairs into the basement alone; search the dark warehouse; even though you're sure it's a trap. Then there are the multiple scenes after each trap where the two main characters are healing or are healed with more angst and guilt trips. This is how the first book in the series start off, the advertisement for the next two books are more of the same. Not worth buying. (Amazon Verified Purchase)"
4,"LamsonSharp 6"" Jumbo Turner","This spatula is just what the doctor ordered, well made and substantial. It being the right size to pick up and turn over a large pancake in a skillet, it fills the bill. If there is any negative about it, unless the skillet is flat-like (a cast iron or other type that has virtually no sides) or a super extra large frying pan, it is difficult, due to its size, to get the spatula underneath the item you want to turn over. One other note: if used for turning pancakes, it is best to spray the spatula with cooking oil at the same time one sprays their skillet in order to facilitate the turner sliding completely under the pancake without the pancake sticking to it. Of course, it being metal, this turner is not for use with one of those non-stick/coated frying pans."
3,Huge,"Well-built in true Lamson Sharp tradition, but it is just so big. I get way more use out of the flared turner. I must mention that these can go into the dishwasher with no adverse effect. Awesome utensil, just too big for my needs."
3,Not worth it in this day of internet .,"1998, do you remember that year, I dont. Not really.This book is now outdated in so many ways. Not worth the shipping as you can get all this information online that is up to date."
4,A must have for every investigator!,"I have used this guide for my investigations for eight years, from the fourth edition. It only gets bigger and better!"
2,Did not live up to expectations,"The Krypton bulb burned out within the first 2 days of using this product, and I wasn't even using that bulb. Somehow my batteries were used up after 1 days use, maybe it got accidently clicked on during the day. My replacement batteries did the same thing, so by the end of a 3 day trip I had no light as I only brought one set of replacement batteries. When the light was working properly it gave off great light."
1,Bad old translation,"I don't know why such a weak old translation remains in print given the excellent more recent ones by folks who actually read, speak, and understand current K'iche' Maya and who also have the translators' tools for historical work. This translation is based on a one hundred-year-old French translation that was full of errors. Get Tedlock's prize-winning translation instead."
4,good,this is a great clock! it has big green numbers it also has a good tuner! i live near morganton and can pick up charlote stations! i give it 4 stars!
2,"Was great for 3 months, then it died on me.","This was a really great alarm clock, and if I was posting this review yesterday I would've given it a 5 star review. However, after just 3 months of life, it died. I came home from work to see it displaying OEO instead of the time. Perplexed, I unplugged it from the wall and replugged it in. Now nothing lights up. Pushing the On/Off button does nothing. RCA has no mention of it on their website, and writing to RCA has thus far returned nothing. Oh well, waste of ten bucks I guess. I'm only giving it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it served me well for those few short months..."
3,Backlight is so dim,"From the beginning the backlight is so dim as to be a joke. Working 3rd shift I keep the room blacked out, so it is plenty dark and I still have trouble seeing the display with the backlight. That being said, the rest of the clock has worked fine. It seems that you have to take care of the lid/stand as it seems to be fragile."
4,Great for home and travel,"I like:- two alarms with selectable snooze time- push on top of unit to snooze and turn on backlight- sets to atomic clock via WWVB- easy time zone switching- folds up small for throwing in a suitcase- uses standard AAA batteryI wish:- backlight were brighter- it had a thermometer- controls were more intuitiveI do recommend this clock and would buy it again, but there's still room for improvement."
2,La Crosse WT-2165U travel alarm clock,"I bought this clock becaue I understood it would automatically swith to whatever domestice timezone I was in. Either I don't know how to use it or it does not. I travel every week so wanted a worry free clock requiring little input from me that I could depend on rather then hotel wake up calls. Also it does not light up bright enough at night to clearly read the time. Nice light weight, compact clock, but disappointing."
1,"Broke after only a few months, poor design.","At first I really liked this clock, it functions very well, but it broke after a few short months of use. It is designed so that you press down and back to hit ""snooze"", which is actually pretty difficult to do when you're asleep-- a simple button is much easier-- and when I did this one time it bent all the way back and snapped off the base. It won't even stand up without the base so it's useless. Also the folding design is good for travel in theory, but all the buttons are on the back and it folds toward the front, so all the buttons are exposed when it's folded. Thus the alarm could easily get turned on while in your bag."
2,Make Sure You Know What Your Buying,"Thought the quality would be much better. Does it work - Yes. But, it is a cheap, cheesy feeling plastic travel clock. Gets the job done, but I was very disappointed on the quality side."
2,Bad design,"This might be fine as a travel alarm but not as an every day alarm, which is what I bought it for. I have had this clock a little more than a month and the snooze function has already broken. Because all of the control buttons are on the back of the clock, and all of them look and feel the same, it is very difficult to turn off the alarm unless you are in a brightly lit room. Because I don't want to wake my husband, I have to get out of bed and take the beeping clock with me into another room to turn it off. The clock also feels flimsy. I hope it breaks soon so I can buy a different alarm clock."
1,Setting alarms is a pain; display light died,"The instructions for setting the time and the alarm are written in the inside cover, and for good reason - It is not intuitive and even when you follow the instructions, you've never quite sure that you've got it set right. I've had the alarm go off when I didn't want it to, and I've had it not go off when I wanted it to, making it pretty much worthless as an alarm clock. I still tried using the clock for a while as just a clock and not an alarm clock, but then the backlighting stopped working."
5,LOVE IS ALL; DO AS YOU WISH,"THERE IS A SIMPLE SPIRITUAL EXERCISE IN THIS BOOK WHICH I TRIED. WITH MY EYE CLOSED, WHILE SITTING DOWN IN MY ROOM I STARTED TO SING THE WORD HU HU HU HU HU HU IN A LONG DRAWN OUT FORM LIKE A ROLLING THUNDER.I MADE SURE I WAS LISTENING TO THE SAME SOUND I WAS ROLLING FOR 20 MINUTES . WITH MY EYE CLOSED I STARTED TO SEE WHITE LIGHT AND HEAR A SOUND OF FLUTE OR MORE LIKE VIOLIN OR MIXTURE OF BOTH.AFTER I FELT VERY PEACEFUL ALL DAY LIKE A LITTLE CHILD.I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS BUT I LOVE THE FEELING AND NOW I DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY BEFORE I SLEEP AND BEFORE I GO TO WORK.I HAVE BEEN WALKING AROUND SMILING AND HAPPY AND MY JOB HAVE SINCE TESTED ME OF DRUGS 3 TIMES AND FOUND NO DRUG IN ME.THEY ARE NOW USED TO A NEW ME. I DONT DRINK OR SMOKE I JUST DO MY LITTLE HU HU HU HU HU HU EXERCISE GIVEN BY THIS AUTHOR SRI HAROLD KLEMP."
3,No replacement was available,I had to return it and they had no replacement but the sent my money back right away. The product worked for about ten minutes but the the distance probe kept sticking. Other than that it seemed like a good product. Had to spend double the money to get a comparable tool.
4,"Actually, this is the same recording as Trance Planet 3!","I don't know why the repackaging, but it seems to be exactly the same as Trance Planet 3, so if you have that one, don't be fooled by the new cover or numbering."
1,NOT Trance!,"This album contains a series of ""ethnic"" music with ""new age"" overtones. Beautiful music for peace and relaxation, but I won't classify this as trance. I was disappointed with the content as it did not give me psychedelia I've wanted."
2,ugh,"I recently bought this rub collar to run some raised panel doors ,only to find out that it did not fit on my 3/4 inch spindle.. I have a brand new delta 5hp shaper, funny cause the cutters I bought from grizzly (reversable ogee cutter set) fit but the rub collar that seperated the two cutters did not.. its close but will not seat all the way down the spindle, guess I can try hammering it,lol, but will never get it off that way..lol.. I hate to use this quote with grizzly caue I'm usually verry happy with there products but ya get what ya pay for.. thats probably why amanas set was $50 more.. I even bought a seperate collar by it self thinking it was a flute but that one was the same..Now that I think of it its woodstock that makes that collar not grizzly but they should not be putting on there cutter sets..its way to tight ...Ill try and send it back now if I still could.."
4,A Great Game That's Breathtaking for DOS,"This game is one of my favorites. Yes it's not exactly new but it's still quite a lot of fun. The object of the game is to build armies of orcs or humans, depending who you are, and sending them out against your opponent. Clicking characters several times gets them mad at youy while clicking wild animals several times make them explode! This game is a lot of fun and its battle editor will make hours of fun gameplay."
5,"SKRAPE ""NEW KILLER AMERICA"" IN STORES NOW!","SKRAPE'S FIRST CD ''NEW KILLER AMERICA'' IS FINALY ON THE SHELVES OF RECORD STORES EVERYWHERE! WITH KILLER TRACKS LIKE ''BROKEN KNEES'' AND ''KILL CONTROL'' SKRAPE IS SURELY AN AWESOME BAND! I HAVE TO SAY PERSONALLY THIS IS MY FAVORITE BAND, AND IF YOU BUY THE CD, IM SURE IT WILL BE ONE OF YOURS TOO! SO IF YOU HAVE HEARD THE SINGLE WASTE, AND WANT TO HEAR MORE, BUY THE CD, YOU WONT BE WASTING YOUR MONEY!"
3,Mediocre Wallup,"For the most part this album isn't all that bad. Unfortunately it isn't all that good. The majority of the album sounds identical to itself with little variation and little punch. Notable exceptions are tracks Waste, Isolated, and Rise. Isolated and Rise are easily the most impressive songs on the album and subsequently the only reasons I gave it three stars instead of two. If you can find this CD used it'll probably be worth your money, but I wouldn't recommend it at full price. Ideally, find someone else who owns it and burn Waste, Isolated, and Rise off of it. As a side note of praise they don't sound a whole lot like most of the other up and coming metal bands, which lends some originality to their music, the only problem with this is that their somewhat original sound is less than remarkable. I'll be keeping an eye out for any other albums they release. A little bit more experience and they could really rock."
2,Nothing you haven't heard before,"This CD isn't afwul. It's just.... blah. I had to force myself to listen to the entire thing, since all the songs sound the same. The music is nothing special and the vocalist sounds like he wants to be Chino Moreno of Deftones, but he can't compare. There's nothing really wrong with this album, and maybe they can improve in the future. I don't know. If you like this but want something better, I recommend Deftones' first and third albums, Nonpoint and Disturbed."
5,New metal outfit planning to take on the world!!!,"If anyone out there thinks they can handle one of the newest and best heavy metal outfits they should check out skrape. They have a good new sound, heavy for the most part but with a great mellow sound to them. Lost in the Limp Bizkit scene? Sick of all these flashy poser bands? Well society thankfully put out a band that you can be proud of listening to. Act now and you will recieve this cd with an awesome enhanced video of Waste. Waste is a good song (not their best in my opinion but it's a good sound."
3,Not as bad as i thought it would be,Okay first of all I saw these guys live with static x I didnt think they sounded to good live ( kinda boring stage presence) But I saw this cd going for 99 cents on Amazon marketplace so I said what the heck and bought it I think its a good straight forward nu metal cd nothing ground breaking but I have listened to it like 4 times in a row so far Becasue all the songs kinda flow together and I like that Im kinda out of the nu metal thing now but sometimes I find something I like in this genre
1,"Surprisingly Dry and Boring, Don't be mislead by ""Waste""","Skrape has been getting a fair amount of attention on the air wavs with their first single ""Waste."" That is a fairly good song, good enough to get me to spend money to see what the rest of the songs are like and to see what Skrape has to offer. Wow was I disappointed. I should have seen it coming. Skrape is just another 5 second band. Get some airplay, then completely disappear. I know this band will not do another album under the title of Skrape. This album is just dry as .... It offers exactly nothing. Besides ""Waste,"" every song sounds exactly the same. They all have the same boring riff and same boring chorus. And the lyrics are just stupid. Stay the hell away from this is all I can say. And I hate it when everytime a band comes along with a high pitched singer, they are compared to Tool. This is nothing like Tool."
1,SKRAPE IS A FRAUD!!,"THIS BAND SUCKS!! THEIR MUSIC IS UNORIGIONAL AND BORING AND THEY STOLE THEIR NAME FROM SCRAPE, THE DEATH METAL BAND ON CENTURY MEDIA RECORDS (NOW KNOWN AS SCAR CULTURE) ITS PATHETIC THAT SCRAPE (WITH A C NOT A K) HAD BEEN AROUND LONGER, BUT THESE LOSERS GOT TO KEEP THE NAME!!"
1,EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME!!!!,"This has to be one of the most boring bands i've ever heard in my life! Everything this band does has been done before by countless other bands. Sick cat vocals, repetitive guitarist who is in power chord heaven and won't take the time to pull off a lead or solo, basslines that are nonexistant, and slow drumming. At least try a good nu-metal band like System of a Down, Deftones, or Mushroomhead. Then get some real metal like Megadeth, Children of Bodom, Opeth, Black Sabbath, Pantera, Tool(I consider them metal, especially after 10000 Days), Slayer, Iron Maiden, Death, well you get the point. Don't let this CD Skrape the money out of your wallet."
4,almost perfect,"Actually, I know this band from [the] website. At the beginningof i got this album.I think maybe just some songs are good.And the rest song is so-so. But oh my god. Whole the album is great.There is no so-so song on this cd.When i listen the opening riff of { what you say} I believe this album must makes me pleased. I can feel skrape mix up jane'saddiction, soundgarden,deftone,and a little of power metal element in their song.HOWEVER i recommend this cd for heavy music fan. Absolutely don't miss this album.I believe this band is going to be very famous in the future."
3,They show some promise and have the potential,"Of all of the bands to come onto the scene in the past four years of this nu-metal BS, Skrape may be one of the few remaining a few years from now. I hadn't listened to these guys before ever until I saw them live on the Extreme Steel tour when they opened for Pantera, Slayer, Static-X, and Morbid Angel last summer. After hearing them play live, I kind of liked what I heard and checked out ""New Killer America"". While the music and lyrical content is nothing original, Skrape have what it takes to become a much greater band than they are right now. All in all, ""New Killer America"" is nothing original in the least, but it is worth checking out."
1,Garbage....Nothing but Garbage,"So I figured that if these guys could tour with the likes of Pantera, Slayer, Morbid Angel and Static-X, then they must be OK. Boy was I taken for a loop. .... Skrape for me, is quite disapointing."
4,COOL!,"I got this CD on impulse (i do this a lot) at Best Buy, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a really good CD all the way through, GREAT to listen to in the car, and it's a real good headbanging disc. Enjoy it. Live it. Love it."
4,Fun twist to the metal scene,"A great CD with a mix of hard core metal ""E- chords"" and strong vocals. I'm not a big fan of recent metal music, but these guys are fun to jam to. Enjoy!"
5,Fandango - a pleasant soothing collection,"I heard this CD playing in an antique store and thought it was really great. The clerk looked up the title and I ordered it. It is everything I was looking for, a really nice mix of old ""cowboy"" and spanish music, very wel played."
4,Nice Music,Some nice Western Songs. It reminds me of some of the songs I use tosing in music class in elementary school many many years ago. They havea good clean & clear sound. It will take ya to another place and time.
3,3/4 length sleeves,I wore this leotard for Halloween (I was Smurfette) luckily I also bought gloves because the sleeves were very short on me. This fit good everywhere else but those sleeves are just extremely short.
1,I AM STILL WAITING ON MY MONEY,THE 6 LEOTARDS CAME. THE COLOR WAS OFF. I CALLED THE COMPANY AND LEFT MESSAGES. I GOT NO RESPONSE. I MAILED THE PRODUCT BACK. THEY SAID THEY NEVER RECEIVED IT. THEY REFUSED TO GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY. I AM NOW OUT $80.MY ADVICE IS TO ORDER FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.
4,Nicely made,I bought a large and I am probably around a 7 and it fit well because it stretched. Unfortunately I am around 5'7 ad it was a little right lengthwise. Other than that it was nicely made and I have no complaints. I received it quickly as well.
2,Pease stop exploiting Sammy!,"Don't be tricked by the price tag...this is no steal of a deal. the only eason i gave it two stars is because i dont believe sammy did anything bad enough to only deserve one star. dont get me wrong...its not necessarily sammy, just the poor song selection and the typical line-up of I GOTTA BE ME and MR. BOJANGLES, ECT. as big a sammy fan as i consider myself to be, i could live without this one. stop the expoitation of sam's work....please. for a good buy check out the Rhino/Warner box set YES I CAN or SOUNDS OF 66 WITH BUDDY RICH. these will show you why sam was such a great entertainer."
2,Please Stop Exploiting Sammy!,"Don't be misled the quality of the cd is limited by the poorsong selection such as I'M OVER 25 and IF I COULD TALK TO THEANIMALS. The producers at Curb just slapped on stereo-typical I GOT TA BE ME and MR. BOJANGLES and continued the exploitation of Sam by those looking to make a quick profit off the ""usual"" sammy songs. One would do much better purchasing the YES I CAN boxset or SOUNDS OF '66 WITH BUDDY RICH. These cds truly show what sammy is capable of as a singer and entertainer. END"
5,An overlooked action film. Deserves better recognition than it has received.,"This movie should have had a theatrical release in the US. I just saw it, and it has great fight scenes, a good plot, and solid acting. The movie was far better than most action B movies I have seen. Michael Jai White is as good as Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal were in their prime."
4,Surprisingly good,"Who knew that Michael Jai White was so good? The star of 1997's maligned adaptation of Spawn has never seemed to rise to that position of action film all-star that he otherwise should be, but if there's one example of why he should be, Blood & Bone is it. White stars as Bone, a recently released inmate on a mission , and takes on all customers on the street fighting circuit. He catches the attention of a local crime lord (Oz veteran Eamon Walker, who is wonderfully menacing) on his rise to the top, but Bone proves to be cunning in more ways than just the physical aspects. Though its editing leaves something to be desired, the film is surprisingly well-written and even more so surprisingly choreographed in terms of fight scenes; making Blood & Bone is definitely worth seeing for fans of action/martial arts films. Don't let the fact that it's been released direct to DVD fool you, Blood & Bone is a blast."
3,A good show for Michael Jai White,"This was a lil independent actioner that I picked up cuz I love Micheal Jai White..and I thought it would be fun. The plot was predictable, and a bit flimsy...but it had special guests from the world of MMA, the likes of Kimbo Slice, and Gina ( my secret lover) Currano...so it was high on entertainment in my opinion. There is not much to this film outside of some pretty cool fight scenes (and that may be an understatement..the fight scenes are awesome) It gets a little slow toward the ends and culminates in a predictable confrontation between the protagonist and antagonist. Nuthin' new but lots of fun...I say if you like action and kung fu flicks..and if the price is right...go for it."
3,Interesting fighting scenes + Stiff acting = Still worth watching if you're a martial-art fan,"Interesting fighting scenes + Stiff acting = Still worth watching if you're a martial-art fan.After watching this movie, I pull out my collection of Ultmate Fighting Championship and watched them. They're more realistic."
4,"Very good movie, poor quality dvd.","This is a very good movie with alot of action but I was disappointed in the quality of the movie, it showed very dark we turned the lights off to see if we could see the movie better but was very disappointed. As I stated, this is a very good movie but I wish I would have purchased from somewhere else."
4,guilty pleasure,"i don't have much more to say about this flick that hasn't been said....sadly, MJW needs more dialogue. The guy is sly, slick, confident, and kind oflike that line in Black Dynamite...""wink and a smile"" - ""i am smiling""...for those that have seen BD.fun on a saturday afternoon if you're snowed in....fun on a saturday night when your altered.cameo from julian sands is fun and swanky....MJW is amazing to watch. I don't know how he can move like that and be so damn bulky....read about his exercise routines focusing on flexibility but the guy is fast, smooth, good on the mat.rent this"
5,BAD TO THE BONE,"MICHEAL ""JAI"" WHITE IS A FANTASTIC ACTOR AND VERY UNDER RATED. HE IS AN EVEN BETTER MARTIAL ARTIST. I AM A SERIOUS MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE FREAK, AND HAVE SEEN ALMOST EVERYTHING. THIS MOVIE HAS THE BEST FIGHT SCENES TO DATE. MICHEAL IS THE REAL DEAL. THE FOUR KICK SEQUENCE IS INCREDIBLE. THIS MAN HAS ""SKILLS"" I PUT HIS MOVES AGAINST BRUCE LEE AND JACKIE CHAN. HIS STUFF POPS. THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ANY KUNG FU NUT. IT IS VERY REALISTIC, AND SHOWS MICHEALS"" AGILITY AND POWER. THE PLOT WAS GOOD FOR A MARTIAL ARTS FLICK, AND THE SIDEKICK WAS FUNNY AS HELL. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF MR. WHITE, TOO BAD THIS MOVIE WASN'T PROMOTED BETTER. IT'S A COLLECTORS ITEM FOR ANY MARTIAL ARTS BUFF. THANKS MICHEAL, YOU ROCK!IYA KHAN"
1,western movie,"DEAD AIM was horrible. did't even finish watching it.THE DESERTER which is an exceptional movie, was bad because it skipped and blacked out in spots. was very disappointed."
4,Good Discount Bits,"I bought this bit set a few years ago for those rare occasions when I need a bit that's a little longer than normal (pocket holes, etc.). I have used them a few dozen times, only in wood (hard and soft), and mostly in a hand held electric drill - I have been pleased with the results.These are not the highest quality drill bits you can buy, but they are good enough for average work. Considering you get 13 bits for about the price of one or (maybe) two high quality ones, I think these are a pretty good deal.Regarding flexing, I don't think it's possible to make a thin, long bit that won't flex a little, and many of the bits in this set are thin. Whenever possible I try to drill a pilot hole using a standard size bit, and then use the 6"" bit for the remaining depth. This seems to minimize the flexing problem."
5,Great Product,The Neca head knockers are a great collectible item and I have numerous. The detail is fantastic and they look great. The ear was broken but I glued it back ....
4,A Great Way to Experience Joy and Peace Everyday,Choosing Happiness is a delightful book with creative ideas on how Alexandra Stoddard personally chooses happiness in her daily life. Alexandra does not force her ideas on you but gives lovely examples and suggestions of the choices that she makes. This book truly expanded my ideas for finding joy and creativity in new areas that I had not thought about previously. While enjoying this book I was reminded of Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment which also gives simple and inspiring ways to choose daily happiness and live in peace and joy.
2,Very Disappointing,"I have always been a big fan of Stoddard's books, finding all kinds of useful and insightful ways for making life a more joyful experience. That is probably why I found this book so disappointing. It lacks the personalization of her previous books and is essentially a distillation of all the things she has written before. No new insights, no new inspiration. I infinitely preferred her ""Making Choices"" to this book. It's not even as ""pretty"" as some of her previous books. Can it be that Stoddard has run out of things to tell us?"
2,Bizarre. Haughty. Had to say something!,"Here's a key to a ""choosing"" happiness:Go through life so vapidly that redecorating truly makes you happy. Here's the trick - get born rich. Born so rich that you can never conceive of happiness as being something other than a personal choice, as if unhappiness is caused by refusing to go on a shopping spree or jet to Paris.This book consists largely of (pink) quotations, listing the inanities of her friends and relatives amongst wisdom from Sartre and Gandhi. The rest, unintentionally sad and unintentionally funny platitudes that reveal a woman who lists her profession as ""noted thinker"" but has all the depth of a full-length mirror."
5,My Lenten Reading,"I have devoted the Lenten season to reading about inner peace and happiness. Most of my reading is on a deeper level than this book. However, it is a good book for basic ideas to brighten one's mood and day."
2,Happiness for the rich with nothing to do,"This book is pretty much a long rant about this egotistical woman and how she has lived her life.Well, we aren't all rich, nor perfect, so if you have a life touched with reality this book isn't for you. A Martha that tries to be spiritual... not at all what I needed."
2,B'Cuzz Root Stimulator 12 oz.,This product does not work even half as good as some of the other products I've used in the past. Would recommend just using gel or powder products.
3,Small difference with the original,"I got this item for a bike restoration because i have the original GT hanger but it was slightly bended, this item was my only option and since it was so hard to find i bought it regardless of its very high price.When i got it I noticed a small difference in the hole drilling of about 1/32"" or less but enough to render it useless in my frame.(1995 GT Zaskar) i decided to use the old one and keep this a a replacement, an in the case the original breaks I'll just fix the holes in this one and use it"
3,Just when you thought it was safe ...,"Great subject for a book, but I would have preferred more critical commentary from qualified scientists and educators. This book does a great job in covering the theological debate over evolution, but is short on biogenesis, how life first formed."
1,Overreaching title; prematurely self-congratulating text.,"If ""Darwinism"" is the hypothesis that a single reproducing population can branch out into distinct, reproductively isolated populations (species, genus, phylum, and so on) through an evolutionary process driven by natural selection among individually varying members of the original population, then it is very much alive and well. The counter-proposal that design by an intelligent super-being might explain the same physical evidence better is an intriguing one, but it is in its infancy at this point, and it has by no means displaced the natural selection hypothesis in the way that modern medical practices have replaced bloodletting and charmed amulets in the treatment of physical illness. Intelligent Design theorists still have a great deal of work to do, to demonstrate their alternative hypothesis using solid physical evidence."
2,"Oh my, please save me.","This is not your usual Anne Perry, which is not an endorsement but more of a warning. From almost the very beginning of the story the author browbeats you with the one clue that if you know anything about flowers you will know who did the crime and how. There is very little suspense and no character development and by the end you couldn't care less if the beautiful (an adjective repeated constantly) Countess Zorah Rostova did the crime or not.Referencing the audio version, the narrator does an admirable job with the narration and the male voices but he wasn't very good when it came to portraying the female characters lending a, if not intended, comedic slant to the book."
2,Weak entry in solid series,"Talk about giving the ending away in the first chapters--it was, as my sister Becky says--fore-clobbering. I agree with one reviewer who said if you know anything about flowers (I just didn't know which of the many possibles until the last few pages) you get the ending early on. I do enjoy learning history from this series, but I didn't care about tiresome German kingdom-states politics of the 1800s. The narrative was tedious to say the least. Try another in this series and skip this one."
2,Disappointing,"This story plods along to it's rather lame solution. Interesting in parts, but is in the lower rungs of the Monk series.(This novel does not really add anything new to the Monk/Hester/Rathbone relationship.)"
1,Oh Dear,"I used to love the Anne Perry books. She was one of the few authors I permitted myself to buy in hardback, the minute they came out. I even went out of my way to meet Ms. Perry one time. What a crushing disappointment it was to guess this one in Chapter Two.I'm going to keep my eye out for more of her books, but only the Pitt and Charlotte series, and only in paperback.Sigh."
3,Present,"This was a gift for a wedding shower. The groom is a firefighter, the item was a big hit. They don't use it for drinks only for decoration so it will last longer."
5,Another Solid Product By APC,"This APC unit is built rock-solid and does exactly what we need it for: keep our machines up and running when the power goes out. With 4 battery backup ports (plus 3 surge only outlets) and very quiet operation, this is a must have accessory for anyone that uses their computer on a daily basis. Upon setting up this unit we lost power only days after plugging this in and we were able to continue our work and save our precious data before disaster struck. With the very likely possibility that an electrical surge can happen at any moment and cause a $15 surge protector to allow this deathblow through without the slightest resistance, you would be ill-advised to not have one of these protecting your investment(s)!!***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,APC Top Notch,"I have several APC UPS devices running several computers, cable modem and wireless router and they have kept me working throughout many short outages (I work at home testing software), others run a Tivo & cable box (never missed anything on TV I wanted to see) and a salt water aquarium. They've all performed flawlessly. The one Tripplite I owned a while back let me down with poor power regulation. I've been delighted with APC. Only downside is there are units that sound an alarm every 30 seconds while on battery power, that can get a bit annoying. Otherwise these things are outstanding."
1,NOT happy with it.,"I have always used other products since I didn't think I could afford APC, but after looking at them I realized they were inline with everyone elses prices so I got one. The second day it went into battery mode for NO reason, I contacted customer support who said it must have a bad relay in the switching mechanism. Ok that can happen to anyone. I sent the unit back to them and received a new unit to replace it. Now this unit after one week I had a power sag (brown out) and the unit did its job and kicked in, but like the first one, it won't come back out of the battery mode. So far ""my"" opinion is that they are junk. I mean 2 in a row?????"
5,It lasted a little over 4 years.,I just replaced this model with the UPS XS 900VA in my office. I was very happy with the 800. It lasted 4 years and saved my system many times.
1,WARNING regarding Garmin GPS Compatibility,"Although the Amazon website says ""Transfer your notes and routes from your GPS to Terrain Navigator's detailed maps to analyze where you've been"", MyTopo Terrain Navigator is not compatible with my Garmin etrex Vista HCx GPS.I had no way of knowing this until I installed the software and attempted to go through the GPS setup procedure where the software would not recognize my Garmin model.I returned the package to Amazon.com same day as received."
3,Ehhh..,"It's not the best book, but it's not the worst either. I love the large, beautiful color photographs and the ease of the two patterns I've tried thus far. However, I have a real problem with an author/publisher putting out a book with ""50"" baby bootie patterns, and it turns out to be far less than that. Changing the color of the yarn and adding a pretty ribbon does not make a different pattern. I do really admire Zoe Mellor as a designer, this book was just not what I expected."
2,I'm disappointed,"As a previous reviewer said, this book does not have fifty different bootie patterns--too many are simply variations on a theme. In addition, much of the photography is very poorly done, with many designs out of focus and/or overexposed to the point of obscuring detail on the knitted item. For these reasons and my belief that the book itself could have been half the size it is, with far fewer pages (large, sparse type on informational pages), and therefore less costly, I would not recommend purchasing this book.All that being said, there are some cute patterns in the book. I recommend borrowing it from your public library instead."
3,lots of detailed finishing,"Many have soles knitted separate and sewn on -(you can't tell this in some of the pictures - really talented finisher, I guess). Some cute patterns. Some just goofy embellishments -(sequins and yarn tassels? They just beg to be swallowed). I have made one pair of the shoes (with the sew on soles) and there may be a couple more that I will do."
4,Great if you don't mind teeny needles!,"This book is filled with beautiful designs and instructions that are easily read and understood. This is not a book for busy Moms with little time on their hands, though, because nearly every pattern requires size three needles! Buy this book if you like to knit heirloom quality gifts that show off the time and skill put into them."
5,very nice projects,"very nice projects, I enjoied it a lot. All the projects are based on 3 -4 basic designs with variations, but they are so nice that this was not a problem for me."
5,Great Book,I was surprised to see the rating for this book. I bought this book several years ago and it is my go to resource for booties. It has a great variety of patterns with difficulty levels for everyone. This is one of my favorite knitting books!
2,Pattern Problems,I absolutely loved the patterns in this book. Then I made a pair of socks and found the pattern errors on shaping and turning the heel. After doing some research I learned that Zoe Mellor is infamous for having errors in her patterns and it is REALLY hard to find the corrections. There are a few other patterns in this book that just don't make any sense. Save yourself the fustration of re-writing the patterns and buy a different book.
2,An OK Book...,"Whilst this book has a few cute and practical patterns there are many that aren't really usable at all. Some have no cuffs and would fall off before you can blink, others would be very fiddly to put on a kicking baby.A great book if you're knitting for full sized baby dolls but if not give it a miss."
2,Wonderful designs but patterns made difficult by lack of clarity,"This book has many wonderful different baby booties to knit. However, the pattern instructions are VERY difficult to follow for all but advanced knitters. The knitting and construction are not difficult, just trying to figure out what you're supposed to be knitting. The pattern instructions are not clear and concise--even with the pattern information in the back of the book. There is a lot you have to figure out by trial and error. More clarification would make knitting these booties enjoyable instead of frustrating. I had to rewrite the pattern, not by making changes but by inserting details that should have been included."
3,"3 patterns, not worth the cost","I bought this book anticipating a flurry or wonderful new booty/shoe/sock designs. What I ended up with was about 4 designs and lot of ways to change them up with diffferent color work, straps, buttons, etc. Most of the booties/shoes are constructed in 2 pieces, which I don't really like. I haven't actually sat down to try and make any of these designs because none of them have ""called"" me like I expected them to. Right now it's just another book on the shelf."
1,It's not even a good doorstop,"Worked fine for a few weeks, but now doesn't even heat up. I see that it's discontinued ... yeah, because it's a piece of junk! Wrote to Amazon ... they ignored me. I might as well throw it out. I even bought the extra jars. Three-year warranty? Yeah, right. I'll never buy from this company again."
3,Yogurt is runny.,"The yogurt made by this machine tastes good, but is quite runny, possibly because I use skim milk. I deal with this by putting oatmeal in the yogurt after it is cooked. (The oatmeal soaks up the extra liquid.)Also, the machine does not turn off automatically. You have to be home and remember to turn it off after 6-10 hours. I wouldn't pay full price for this machine, but it's probably worth the sale price."
1,Need an Instruction Manual,"I recently purchased this yogurt maker, but the instructions were missing. If anyone could submit a manual on this site that would be great. Or, let me know where to find one."
3,Girmi JC70 Yougurt Maker - approval pending,"The votes aren't in yet on this appliance. The directions are poorly written and seem to contradict those for other makers. The first batch took nearly 24 hours to ""set up"". The second batch, made with my own recipe, took less time, but it still isn't perfect. One shouldn't have to spend so much time (and ingredients) experimenting with a simple machine like this. Also, the ""timer"" on the cover is nothing more than a static display, which you set to tell you what time to unplug the devise. Why bother?"
2,I tried several times but I could only make runny yogurt,I tried several times with all different types of milk and yogurt but the best I got was runny yogurt. The recipe it recommended without cooking was definitely the runniest of them all. I returned mine and I am looking for a better yogurt maker.
3,Great yogurt... if you know the tricks,"I bought this yogurt maker several months ago, and was frustrated with watery yogurt. I tried boiling the milk. I tried different brands of yogurt as starter. I even tried different brands of milk, even organic milk. Nothing worked, and I was frustrated that I needed to search for plain yogurt as starter each time I wanted to make yogurt. I bought a machine like this so I would not have to buy yogurt all the time.Now I love it. The two tricks:1) Add 3 tbs milk powder to the recipe. It sets up like nothing and tastes better to boot. Milk powder last years and costs next to nothing.2) Buy a quart of plain yogurt and freeze it in ice cube trays. Store the cubes in the freezer and use for starter. They last months (so far) in the freezer.Too bad these tricks are not in the instructions. It would have saved me headaches and earned it more stars."
5,A Winning Collection of Essays,"Those familiar with Ian Frazier's writings will also enjoy these essays. The concluding essay, ""Out of Ohio,"" alone makes purchase of this volume worthwhile. Those not familiar with Frazier will find witty writing combined with insightful and detailed (at times) observation, along with a few of Frazier's private pursuits like plastic bags in trees."
3,Eh-,"I read the first few pages of this book and couldn't read anymore. It dragged the story out so much I couldn't read it. I think it was a good idea for the story, but not fast-paced enough for my liking. On the other hand, my friend lovews this book. She has read the whole series of Help! I'm Trapped . . . and reads them over and over. If you don't mind slow-moving books, I think you might like this book."
4,good book,"i usually hate reading, but this book was tight. Its about how people eat eachother and stuff. Read it"
3,OK,Its good. But only disadvantage is we can not hang to our shoulder while roaming here and there as it does not have strape to hang. If this product comes with that it would be more good.
2,Canon PSC-70 bag is a bit lame,"Just an FYI for folks out there looking at this bag. It is a very minimalist design and feels cheap. It doesn't fit anything but the camera. It has a belt loop so you can have small bag on your waist but camera is heavy so it doesn't make much sense. I bought another bag that has good padding and room for extra batteries etc... which also has belt loop and is solid construction for SAME price. I do not recommend this bag unless you just want a minimalist bag which has the fashionable ""Canon Powershot"" logo on it."
1,Matt O,"I should have listened to other reviews... Only bought it because ""something was better than nothing"" for are trip to China. It wasn't easy to get camera into or out, not very dustproof.. Shame theres not a decent case for such a nice camera. Years ago I had to pony-up 100 bucks for my Contax case (1000 dollar camera)..."
2,Picture is misleading,"I expected this case to be quite a bit bigger. My camera barely fits in it! It will come in handy when I just want my camera protected in a backpack or something, but if I was going on a long photo session, I'd need space for extra batteries and cards. The picture is very misleading and this case is much smaller in person than it appears on screen."
1,HATE IT!,"This case is not big enough for this camera and extra batteries, I wasted my money. Go to Walmart and get a larger camera bag..."
1,Shame on Canon - G6 won't fit,"After a dozen tries, and trying to be careful that I wasn't making any stupid mistakes, it's official: The Canon PowerShot G6 does not fit in this case. By the time you've zipped one side zipper, and started to try to zip the other, pressure of the sides of the case against the on/off switch on the top of the camera will have switched it on, the telephoto lens will be trying to extend, with complaining beeps, and you are motivated to extricate the camera quickly enough to save damage to the telephoto motor. And Canon has their name on this?"
3,BARELY fits the G6,"You can get your G6 in there. It works better if you don't try to fit the straps in too. I was looking for a very small case to fit my G6 in, in order for it to be protected in my canvas purse (which I'm using as a camera bag), and I think it will work for that purpose. Don't be fooled, though, this thing is VERY small!"
4,Great road trip book,"After my first trip across country, I wanted to write a real road trip book. All of my US guide books give good information about big cities but little about small towns and back roads. The real gems I found on cross country trips were a cheese factory in Wisconsin or an ice cream shop in Iowa. Luckily I found this book before my second cross country trip. It was really great. It gives about 8 different 2-lane highway routes usually stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic or from Canada to the Southern tips of the US. It doesn't cover everywhere I want to go, but it's great if you're going on a long road trip... or if you live near one of the 2-Lane Highways in the book. Although it gives information about large cities along the way, you may want a supplement if you plan on spending lots of time in big cities. This book focuses more on the interesting places between those major cities."
1,High Hopes Fade Fast,"I had the pleasure of uncovering this book at the AWP conference a few years ago, and, with all the praise it received there and all the reviews which gave it Faulknerian comparisons, I grew excited about having time to read it. I began it immediately and my disappointment was almost as immediate. Though the language did in fact remind me of Faulkner and, more recently, of Cormac McCarthy and Jeffrey Lent, in ""Bloodroot"" it was forced and the hand of the author is too present. Also, the dialogue shifts are abrupt and the obvious use of dialogue to propel the narrative weakens its read, for the speech doesn't appear natural. Ultimately, I'm surprised it won its award and that it received such praise. Though the plot is thoughful, it is awkwardly presented and the rough language overshadows the narrative."
1,"Shabby quality, finicky blender","Avoid this blender. You can do better with a low-priced model from your local discount store. Sometimes it won't turn on, sometimes you turn the switch to 'off,' and it won't turn off. Parts of the bowl's handle/spring apparatus also tend to come loose, and you can't use it until everything's properly aligned again. I can't imagine that it actually ever sells for the advertised retail price!"
1,Didn't last very long,"It has been a long time since I bought this and I can't remember how long it lasted or why I didn't return it, but it did not hold up to the rigors of making smoothies. It might be okay if you're just making baby food or very soft products, but don't count on it if you're going to put ice in your smoothie."
1,Giant Egg Cups,These egg cups are only good if you have giant eggs. Not only did i have to wait a month for these to finally show up but when i went to put an egg in it it just fell in and didn't fit snugg. I had put X-Large eggs in them. I would not reccommend these cups. They look nice but thats about it.
3,Too big!!,"The cups look great, but unfortunately they are too big even for the extra large eggs I've purchased. The eggs roll around inside the cup making it hard to eat the soft boiled egg. Wouldn't recommend this purchase"
1,Esto no sirve.,"Me engañaron al comprar esto, los botones son muy duros, es muy incomodo de manejar, el control no se ajusta a la mano y hay que presionar varios botones para realizar muy pocas cosas. No lo recomiendo."
5,Great price for a great quality!!,"I just bought 3 necklace for my nieces and i couldn't be happier! The pearls are all prefect and the whole necklace is very well made. The diamond is tiny, but still very nice! It's a prefect gift and I think a wonderful buy!"
2,Bennett Garmin DVD,This is my first video from this developer. Based on the content of this video I could have easily just read the manual. There is very little information on this DVD and I would suggest not buying it. Just turn on your Garmin and read the manual.
5,it was freaky(in a good way),"as i said, it was a freaky book!! the kind of freaky that scares the air out of a person, causing them not to want to put the book down. if u liked this book, you have got to read danger.com books. they are awesome!!anyways, i still haven't figured out who the kidnapper was!!! was it neale, justin, or was it skip???"
4,Changing society,"Speed and nature of changes between technology, culture and social scheme are different: Gaps. It's nice to learn his perspective on the changes."
3,Hard to rate,"This books gets 3 stars. I would give it 5 stars for factual content, and the goal and ideas behind the book. it gets one star, though, for entertainment. One of the most boring books I;ve ever read... If you're looking for a, enjoyable, thought provoking book, skip this. However, it has tons of information and is a good read to learn something"
1,I won't whisper: do not bother with this book!,"I found this book trite and poorly conceived; the characters were neither interesting nor sympathetic and the plot had to rely on outlandish coincidences in order to plod along. There was no suspense and the basis of the ""mystery"" was not believable. Even the dialogue was weak."
3,Let Me Whisper in your ear,Enjoy the book but it has a lot of spelling mistakes. I've never seen so many mistakes since I started reading the kindle device.
3,This is the first one that I have read from this author.....,"When I first started this book I liked the short chapters. Then I became completely confused with all the characters that had similar names that were introduced in all the beginning chapters. Sometimes it was alittle difficult to try to think ""who was this,"" now? Anyway, I loved the concept of the mystery, but it became alittle ""anti-climatic"" towards the end. I would have liked a few more ""twists"" to the story.I am not completely ruling out this author, I want to read another one of her books to get a ""feel"" for her writing.I do have to say, I did read it in a few short days, which is good for me, I usually take alot longer to read a book with over three hundred pages. This was a fast read!EMW"
5,Excellent novel!,This is one of my favorite novels by Mary Jane Clark. The plot is amazing and the ending is shocking. You will definitely enjoy it.
4,The best Mary Jane Clark book yet.,"The Clark family has a real feel for the suspense novel. This member has set her mysteries around a television network's news division in NYC. Her main character is an up and coming producer of a 60 Minutes-like news program. She is working on a story of the diappearance of a young boy from the old Palisades Amusement Park, not knowing that both she and her superiors at work have ties to the incident. The plot twists and turns are engrossing and I had a hard time putting this one down."
3,A Good Beach Read,"This is a good book for a day at the beach. Laura Walsh, an up and coming producer for a major magazine, is working on an article regarding the now defunct Palisades Amusement Park. When digging commences for the new high-rise building that will take its place, the skeleton of a boy who disappeared 30 years ago is discovered. As Laura continues to try and get information on the Park, she begins to suspect that her father (who ran one of the rides at the park) may have been involved. There are a few surprise twists and turns throughout the story which make this a nice, light suspenseful read which will most likely hold your attention."
3,beware,"It is nice to see many of the great, old, classic cartoons, but I do detest the trend towards controlling evrything in DVD watching. They force you to watch their stupid commercials when you start up the DVD. So annoying, it ruins the whole experience. Given the price they charge you would think that that should be sufficient for their needs."
3,Yes and No,"First of all, it's great to have these on blu-ray. They look good and I found myself laughing out loud (even though I grew up watching them and know many by heart). My three star designation is for the presentation.These are historical documents, yet they are treated as if they are brand new cartoons. The cover art looks like slick cereal box design. The holographic foil material looks ultra-modern. I would have much preferred a retro design. How about the ubiquitous Loony Tunes / Merry Melodies intro for a cover; you know, the concentric circles. That would have been classy. And maybe a matte finish. That would have been cool IMHO. Of course, that would perhaps be more suited to a true chronological collection. It also bugs (pun intended) me that they don't even list the dates of the cartoons in the digibook. Weird. Oh, well."
3,good product but poor dubbing,"The product per se is good but not excelent. First reason, it includes some of the classics, but I was expecting the old ones. I mean, the very very old from the begining and may be a little bit more variety. The original soundtrack in English is O.K. but the new spanish dubbing is ugly and it doesn't match with the characters and the origianl voice that I used to listen. So, if you are a spanish speaker, and you used to like the original dubbing, re-consider to purchase this product because it doesn't include the original, and some of the cartoons are not available in spanish, just a few of them. But if you are very nostalgic about the looney toons, I strongly recomend this product even if you watch with the original language (english) and subtitles in spanish or english. All cartoons are re-mastered but you can see a lot of artifacts on the screen. Colors are O.K. and so is the audio."
3,Anybody else noticing the Hard Cuts to other parts of the scenes?,"I was really excited about this and not even upset about the white dots issue since it seemed like how I saw them as a kid. However, the jarring cut aways to the next part of the scene when someone is about to say/shout something is really noticeable and def takes something away from the experience. I would have liked to have been warned that these were cut and censored before purchasing."
1,The Episodes Are Full OF White Dust,"Until Warner starts releasing the shorts chronologically like Disney did with the Tin Editions I won't but them anymore. First because the episodes are sharp but full of white tiny dots like dust and second because I don't want to see someone else's choice of the ""funniest"" or the ""best"" cartoons. I want to see them by the order they were released. They're a part of history and they should deserve a better treatment."
2,No Visible Wounds,"It is another books that tells you how to get out, but not how you got there (with an emotional abuser) in the first place. What is it about us that causes us to end up with emotional abusers? Lack of options? Low self-esteem? Must be something deeper."
5,This book is essential for peopleraised in the United States,"As a counselor in the field of domestic violence, specifically working with women's groups, I feel I've finally found a thorough explanation of men's non-physical abuse of women in our society. Dr. Miller does a phenomenal job of peeling the onion, i.e. defining and explaining all the convoluted reasoning behind men who control women by any means necessary. Dr. Miller calls this behavior what it is ABUSE. She points out that we are socialized to deny and accept and cover up domestic abuse. My favorite line is her description of our society's response to domestic violence, including non-physical abuse, as one of ""learned helplessness"". This book is enlightening for those who work with women in abusive relationships, for the women themselves and for all of us living in a culture that creates, reinforces and perpetuates abuse against women."
4,Enlightening,"I was given this book about one year before I actually dug it out of the box I'd stuck it in and read it...someone suggested I highlight anything that might ring familiar...suffice it to say, most the book's passages are now bright yellow...Dr. Miller's insights into the abuser and the survivor's experiences - and her profound understanding of ""covert"" emotional/verbal abuse, brainwashing, ""crazy-making,"" etc. were comforting and enlightening and somewhat painful...especially to a girl who had just broken free and remained in denial...I recommend this book to anyone who feels that they are being controlled, manipulated, and/or abused in any way. If nothing else, you will come to know that you are not alone - and in time - you will find strength and courage in the truths that Dr. Miller offers..."
2,Small collection with basic designs.,I am not saying dont buy this one.But beware that this is a only 128 pg book and all of the foldings and designs are basic.I believe a good graphic designer can create the same die-cuts and designs in a very short time. No trade secrets or big creativity involved.
2,Not worth the $$$,"Ok first of all i think if you replace two meals a day with anything liquid your going to loose weight, with that said i think your better off making a protien powder/fruit shake yourself. This taste like crap. It's better if you mix it with juice but when you add all that to it your adding calories. It doesnt last very long either i will not be ordering this again."
4,not sure,Not sure if this works. Guess you must be real strict about meal replacements every day. Taste is good when blended with fruit.
2,It tastes like crap,It was awful! I purchased 3 containers full and the first time I tried it I was gaging the whole time. Next I tried some different recipes to make it taste better and it did not do a think. It tastes like chalky soy milk and I LOVE SOY MILK! I would just rather stick to regular protein/diet drinks.
5,Almased,"This really kept me full and I did not have any problems using it as a meal replacement. I lost weight the first week. It is an acquired taste, but I put cinnamon in mine and it tasted just fine to me. I also noticed that I had more energy and I was not hungry. I will use this product regularly and the only negative for me is the cost: its rather expensive as it lasts for only two weeks if you use it to replace one or two meals a-day."
5,Almased,"It is a great product, and it works. I have used it for a few years now, and I am not disapointed."
2,Aweful,The Almased may work - I will never know as I can't get past the taste. I've tried it a couple different ways and it tastes like - I can't think of how to discribe it. It's chalky and just tastes plain aweful. I still have 90% of the can left and don't know what I'm going to do with it. Definitely won't be drinking it unless someone has a recipe that makes it taste good and can be used by diabetics.
1,EWWW!,I was not able to try the protein powder for the purpose of weight loss because the taste and the consistancy was awful! I was excited to try for the simple science and ingredients in the powder. Maybe when I get desperate I will try again along with add-ins and get back with a review that exclaims WEIGHT LOSS!
3,Can't get past the taste,"I have tried a few meal replacement powders and although this one seems to be full of the right stuff I think it tastes horrible. I have mixed it with fruit, yogurt, even chocolate and it is still not a good flavor. I ordered a vanilla flavored protein powder and will try to mix it with that just so it's not wasted money."
5,Easy on my system,Good high protein product. I typically have problems with my digestive system but Almased was easy on my system. I would definitely purchase again.
1,Not for me,I bought this because I am very sensitive to sugar cane and corn syrup and this has neither. Do not think that because this is made with honey that it won't taste bad. It is horrid. Another reaction I had with this is a increased appetite. All I want to do all day when I drink this is to eat. It is really not like me at all. I usually have a low appetite. I don't know how this could help loose weight when I have constant cravings and a desire to eat all day. I am very grateful that I only bought the one can to try. I will not buy it again.
4,Received a few days before estimated delivery time.,"I did write a review on this product. What can I say? I have been using this product for a while now. Its taste good, lots of engery and I loss weight. I have purchased from Health FoodStores and at Amazon from different sellers. My main reason for buying from you was because you used Amazon Fulliment.Service was great, product great. Life is good."
3,Not What I Thought,"I ordered the Almased product and the Turbo Protein Diet book to do with my husband. We both did pretty well on Day 1, felt a little lightheaded and a bit nauseous. He was still lightheaded but not nauseous by Day 2, but I was extremely nauseous and ended up throwing up for several hours throughout the evening and morning. My husband is going to continue taking the shakes and the vegetable broth for a few more days. I lost 2 pounds in the 2 days and he has lost 4."
4,Excellent item for Diabetes,"I find the product is exactly as advertised. It is an excellent supplement for someone with Diabetes. My only difficulty is getting over the taste. If you mix with flavored items like milk, its cuts the bad taste. Its not really bad like medicine. It just tastes like it smells, kind of like flour would taste if you mixed with water and drank it."
4,Better than expected,"Liquid diet! thought i would be starving, but that wasn't exactly the case. Had my hunger pangs, but they were easily quenched with an Almased drink. Before you buy, you might want to check out their website almased.com. You can download their program for free. FYI - you will need a min of 2 canisters to get through 14 days. All in all the product does boost energy and dropped some pounds. Tastes like mild cornstarch."
2,This stuff is nasty.,"I bought this because of all the great reviews, but i should have asked for a taste sample first. Gross."
5,Super diet aid,"Almased Synergy Diet is the most/best-researched diet aid available, in my opinion. It is effective at burning fat and totally natural. I will always use this product as a stand-by, even after I've lost the inital weight. I've already lost about 10 pounds in just a little over a month."
2,Taste horrible.,My wife followed all the directions and it made her throw up. I would not recommend this product to any one.
2,Not what I expected,The taste is dreadful. I ended up having to add sugar and flavoring to make it palatable. I used it for a week and there was no change in my weight.
1,Product spilled inside of package.,"I made this review twice before with no response. Product came with the outside box OK, but the Almased container inside broken, and the powder all over the box."
4,It does work,"Ok, so the taste of it made me gag. But i had to ""doctor"" it up. I do 12 oz of water, with 6 teaspoons of almased, then i add 3 teaspoons of cocoa powder and 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract. These add ins definitely makes it better. I did lose weight and i even cheated. I lost 4 pounds in a week. I know how hard it is to find a pretty good deal on this but there is a site giving 15% off with the code VIP15 and they are also doing free shipping over 45.00. I just bought 3 and only paid 50.00. Use my link and as long as you spend over $30 you will get $10 off as well as me. Just paste the link in your web browser. [...]"
2,Not for fussy eaters,"By far this product is the worst tasting protein powder I've every tried. I'm on day 2 of the 3 day phase to reset my matabolism and have to brace myself before eating. It's not one thing I don't like, it's everything from the smell, the taste to the price. It's too early to tell whether the product will give the results I'm hoping to get."
1,YUCK....,"However quickly you are to lose weight with this shake, I will stick to my original plan. This shake mix is so gross, I cannot even choke it down. Save your money!"
3,Never got to try the product...,"I don't want to lower the rating of the product, but I never got to try it. The company that fulfilled the item ships through amazon I believe. The container was damaged and I had to return the product."
1,Not Tasty,I was disappointed that the Almased powder was so unpleasing to the taste buds due to its lack of flavor and not fully dissolving. I found it difficult to drink even when mixed with juices and other flavored liquids. I think other products are available at a better price that do the same thing and are easier to consume.
1,Don't Like It,I am sorry to say that after the 1st serving it went in the trash. Just couldn't use it....yuck. Wasted my money on this!
3,protein drink,I cannot rate the product because I haven't tried it. I heard stories about the taste and dreading to try until really ready to commit.
3,Decent at best....,"This is a typical protein powder. I used this product for about a month as a breakfast meal replacement. I lost about 2lbs, so nothing major. My best friend used it as well, but replaced breakfast and lunch and lost around 5lbs in a month. We ate healthy foods and execised about 3 to 5 times a week for about 30-45 min. So no major weightloss with this product.It taste fine, mixes well, but nothing extraordinary when compared to other powders. The increase in metabolism is what drew me to this product (34 years old, one child, and need to lose about 30lbs), but I could get the same result with any other product as well.I would definitely shop around for a cheaper product and I won't be buying this product again, but of course, to each his own!"
4,Great product,"This is a great product . I fasted one week , drank the reccomended 3 drinks a day . (ate no food ).At the end of the week i had lost 9 lbs . It kept by blood sugar level..... so i never got that shakey feeling from my blood sugar going to low . The taste is not so great but adding sugar free flavors did help .It is a great drink to replace a meal . kept me feeling good for hours ,unlike most of the protein drinks on the market,it last longer because it is slowly absorbedI would reccomend this product ."
3,Not that tasty,"I read a lot of reviews on amazon that said this stuff was very tasty, but I don't agree. It has a strange taste and is very gritty. I mixed it in a blender with fruit and sometimes a sugar substitute to make it palatable. I won't buy this again."
3,Nasty tasting,"This product does seem to work. However,I cannot give it glowing recommendations. I am hungry a lot of the time. My major complaint is that it tastes really awful. I have tried vanilla, cinnamon etc. but have found nothing that helps make the taste less offensive."
2,weight loss product,I purchased this as it was recommended for weight loss and energy. I really have not experienced a big change. I use itas directed. Very good seller. Very prompt delivery.
1,didn't work for me,"$30.00 for one container. it lasted less than three days because you use 8 tablespoons. I was starving. I used Davinci's syrup to at least be able to get it down. Expensive, horrible and I was starving 2 hours after each drink.I could eat a lot healthier for less cost and at least feel like something is in my stomach.. This stuff has made me realize that.Hey.....maybe it's just me."
2,ALMASED SYNERGY DIET MULTI PROTIEN POWDER,"I am trying to like it, but the taste and texture are not great. I am not giving up on it because my friend has seen good results"
5,I don't feel hungry!!!!,"I lost 5 lbs the first week!!! I feel energized, my appetite is suppressed & I am losing weight!!!I mix it with Soy Milk & I love the flavor of Almased!"
4,It's recommended for diabetics,"I have type 2 diabetes, and of course the Dr. says lose weight, about 20 pounds. I had read ads in magazines about Almased being recommended for diabetics, so I thought I would try it. I put it in light Almond milk, used a blender and put in a couple of ice cubes, I think it tastes like a malt, you can also add a little cinnamon extract and it's even better!! It has the amino acids that most protien shakes don't have. The difficult part was the first 3 days when it recommends having nothing but the shakes 3 times a day and some broth. I have only lost a couple of pounds, but I have never been a breakfast eater and I can drink a shake with no problem. I feel that the 25 grams of soy protien is really healthy. I am going to continue using it for the health benefits."
1,Good price but only of you use it,Bought this for my wife and she didn't use it. Rule of thumb is let the one that is going to use it buy it!
3,Some Amino Acids in Almased can cause high blood pressure if you take certain meds,"If you have a thyroid condition or take thyroid medications or anti-depressants be careful of the amino acids in this product. My blood pressure is normally 110/70. I had it checked on Mon, it was 135/88 and then again on Wed, 140/92.I had to stop drinking Almased. I should have consulted with my doc and I didn't, my bad. There is one amino that is of the main concern that I checked into: L-Tyrosine. Also, L-Phenylalanine can cause high BP.I'm abit bummed because I felt like it was starting to work but now I know why, 'cause I was getting really wired up.UGH! On to try something else..."
5,Almased Is Wonderful,"My blood sugar was very high, I am insulin dependent. I started on Almased, just 1 shake in the mornings, within 3 days my blood sugar was down to a normal range, I also lost weight."
4,Keeps your hunger satisfied.,I've tried other diet shakes such as slim fast and After drinking the shakes I felt just as hungry afterwards. I would drink a slim fast and be so hungry after it that I'd have to eat a meal anyway. Not so with Almased. I feel completely full after drinking this shake. I don't mind the taste at all. You have to use a blender if you want it to mix well. I use Low fat soy milk and sometimes a frozen banana added to it.
2,it's ok,"I followed the advice on this product and I lost a little weight but it worked as well as other protein drinks I have used. The up side of this product is that it has a lot of nutritional value to it. Find something that has worked for you in the past to lose weight, and stick to it. Best way to do that is to keep occupied. Keep so busy that you have no time to think of cheating. Good luck!"
3,Not Bad,"Starting today, First placement mixed with tropical v8 splash. 161 lbs will state how progress goes. This taste is not to bad."
3,Tastes like Baby formula!,"I am a vegetarian so the proteins in the Almased powder is really nice. I am only on day one & only 2 glasses in and I tried it plain and almost threw up so I added a little cinnamon made it a tad better the 2nd glass I added unsweetend choco powder to it, bad idea the powder didn't mix so it just floated around the top. I hope I lose some weight atleast because the taste is horrible. and I can't find low sodium vegetable broth so I have to watch how much I drink because of the salt so far I had the drinks 4hrs a part and don't feel gungry. good luck to anyone willng to try this diet I hope it works."
3,Almased,"I really liked the idea of this product, but it was not really what I expected. I think the amount they want you to put in a bottle of water is overkill and honestly it tastes like you dumped plain flour into your drink. I decided not to put in water anymore. Now I add it to shakes and smoothies, and you don't even notice it this way. So if you want to add something to your smoothies, get it. If you want to just drink this with water for the diet plan, then you might have a really hard time choking it down."
1,Not Happy,"This stuff is one of the worst things I've ever tried. No matter how much you mix it, it is still grainy! I might be able to get past that, if it had some sort of flavor. Might work if I could stand to drink it! Guess I'll never know."
5,Very Good Book,"Very usefull book, with lots of articles versing on all aspects of birds of prey. I strongly recommend for everyone involved with raptors, be a falconer, a biologist or a veterinarian."
1,Never received the product!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It has been over 1 month and I still have not received my product. Why?
4,Comprehensive,"It there is a body of water in Oregon with fish in it, its listed in this book. From salmon to largemouth bass, Fishing in Oregon will put you on 'em. My only complaint is with some of the directions to the locations. Unless you're fairly familiar with the area mentioned it can get a bit tricky. Though a good Oregon map pretty much makes up for any difficulty. If you live in Oregon and you fish, this book is a must."
3,shorter than the original book,"I didn't realize it wouldn't be exactly the same as the english version of the classic book. It is a board-type book for very young children, and it has many fewer pages so quite a bit of the story is left out."
2,Not what I expected...,"This is a mini-book...not a regular size book. I guess I did not realize that before purchasing and was quite surprised to reash in and pull out the book...the book is very small and missing more than 60% of the actual story. Disappointing to say the least. The story itself is one my favorites with my daughter, but again, much of it not there."
3,Not for learning Spanish,"I purchased this book thinking it would be a good way for my kids and me to pick up some Spanish words. However, I agree with the other reviewers that it is not appropriate for that. While I can't speak to the difficult tense of the verbs, I do know that this version does not follow the English version in a way that would make it easy to directly translate what is going on. The kids still enjoy it, and feel like they're reading Spanish, so it is fun in that regard."
2,Abridged version,"This is an abridged version. The story has also been rearranged. The cute encounter between the two dogs about the hat has lost its charm in this version.I thought this would be a good beginning Spanish book because of all of the colors and sizes, prepositions, etc, but this is too short to include all of those simple descriptions."
5,My son's favorite book!,"My son is 20 months old and he absolutely LOVES this book. He'll have me read it to him six times in a row and he still doesn't get tired of it. I think he especially likes the flow of the words and the simplicity of the sounds. I've tried to read other books with more words on the pages and he loses interest, so this is a great book to read at first when kids are getting used to hearing written words out loud. It's also very durable!"
5,My son's favorite book,"What do you get when you combine cars, dogs, Spanish and books: A book my two year old loves and I love to read to him. Its a classic in English my only complaint is there are not enough good translations or original books like this to keep our Spanish library stocked with fun interesting titles that I don't have to make up the words for. A must have."
2,They sent me the wrong one!,"the only reason am giving it that low rank is that they actually sent me the wrong battery,which i donno if it is gonna be the rule for everyone who asks for this battery,they sent me Lenmar CLK-5C not 5B as sown above!i had to pay for shipping back..but they gave me a refund on the battery's initial shipping..anyway Lenmar itself is a great battery trademark,i tried it b4 and it works really great..."
1,not happy,"got the wrong size battery, not the one i ordered. didn't wanna deal with the hustle so i just kept it and took the loses. always looking for an easy hustle free transaction."
1,PhotoCopy,"The Book is not original as describes, its a PhotoCopy of the Original one, that really embarrassing to have this in Original Price."
5,super tight performance and production,this album is a masterpiece to the fullest. i have followed the knobs for a few years and was the 1st to congratulate them on their deal with wildebeast. this album contains all hot new material that teh band wrote almost spur of the moment when they had just completed an EP. its amazing that they could crank out such hot stuff so quickly but this is a winner all the way. i highly recommend this fine work of art.
3,A mediocre bibliography of the U.S. Constitution,"With 850 citations, many of them with descriptive annotations, this reference work should be useful for university libraries and for advanced researchers on the Constitution. At the same time, the short descriptions are not always reliable. Many are evidently written by a person not conversant with the subject; some focus on a minor aspect of the works described. This book cites materials in a variety of genres, including primary as well as secondary sources, and electronic as well as print formats. While usefully touching on many genres and formats, it cannot be comprehensive since it cites only about 850 titles. This is more than enough to give the researcher a good start in the massive and variegated literature on the Constitution, but the book is not as comprehensive or as authoritative as it aims to be."
4,BUTTER,"THIS IS A JAM-ON PAIR OF SCIZZORS. I liked it because it has a rainbow appearance. Yet it is metal, so it can't be a rainbow. BUT IT IS!!! Don't just listen to my expert advice, just buy the scizzors. I bet the seller even has a no-money back guarantee. This is a serious consideration. Let me mention on last thing - it cuts through butter like a knife does except with scizzors on hair. you take your pick, scizzors and butter is probaly not the winning combination. did I mention I am from a far away nation. Yes, and that is what makes me an expert with Jaguar scissors. We have them all over Saudi Arabia. Thanks for your kind reading of many facts and pertin information. we make your oil pricy, but your scizsors oh so cheap. please buy these!"
1,Don't be misled by the product description,"The product description for this book is in error. The description is for a translation of Johan Bojer's ""Den Siste Viking,"" about Lofoten fishermen. This book, however, is an old English novel about the Viking Age. Somebody is in error. Don't buy this thinking you're getting the Bojer book."
5,Happy with this purchase,I would recommend buying college books and textbooks on amazon instead of going to the school bookstore. I just ordered it online and it was shipped quickly to my house. It is very simple and fast.
2,If you haven't lived...how can you know,"This woman takes on Peter Taylor's important prose. Of course, her perspective is painfully provincial and her style the copied, earnest voice of a daddy's girl who has no real opinions of her own...but reads just enough to capture the obvious and restate it in a way that is pale enough to get publication. It is too bad that Taylor can be read by anyone and misunderstood by someone who had to have been a cheerleader in some incarnation. Oh Gee Whiz isn't the south full of mystery and custom? yikes. Please promise me she won't write about Percy...she might tell us that he has an interest in the south too."
3,Strictly for Sun Ra Fans,"While any CD's of Disney music as interpreted by various artists are welcome ....and I collect as many as I can find.....this CD is one of the lesser efforts. If you are a fan of Sun Ra's raucous experimental arrangements you will probably enjoy this. If not, you will find it merely annoying."
1,Second Star doesn't shine...,This cd was a major disappointment. It sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement and the singers' voices were not up to par.
5,What Would Washington Do?,"J.R. Norton calls our current crop of political leaders to task with this wonderful, funny book. By paralleling the lives and actions of guys like Tom Paine, James Madison, John Locke, and other Founders and Framers, he does an incredible job of simultaneously making us ridiculously proud to be part of the legacy of these amazing men and making us feel embarrassed and outraged at the perversion of their values that has taken place during the Bush Administration. A wonderful, worthy read--one that will make you both laugh and cringe."
3,Not a quick fix book.,"This wasn't the book I expected it to be. I was ready for a book that would give me a quick answer to all my lawn question, but this isn't it. There is some work you need to do before you read this book. The major thing is find out the pH of your soil then go from there.It is a lot of if you have A then do 1 and if you have B then do 2 answers. I was really expecting if you have fescue then do A, B & C and you will have a great lawn, but it isn't that easy.It does make a good reference book after you do some work to find out a lot about your lawn and soil. I will put it on the shelf and when I see something strange I will consult the book but I don't think it is going to get a lot use."
2,Low quality radio,"I just received this today. It has a nice updated look, large buttons, & big bright display but the sound is terrible. Also I thought it had a digital tuner instead of this 1980 turn knob that's hard to control. Also there are no station presets which is a must with any clock radio! I'm returning this one."
1,Don't buy this piece of trash!,"I bought this recently, and the first thing to go was the CD player. I played a CD on the SECOND day that I had it, and after 10 minutes of normal play, the sound is distorted. Tech help is NO help.Stick to the better brands like Sony or Philips if you want a CD clock radio, jWin is a LOSE LOSE proposition."
2,"Giant, bright, low quality","Although the price for the alarm with CD player is low, its flaws are really bad. First of all this alarm is giant.This clock alarm is almost the size of regular CD player. It can barely fit on the shelf near my bed. Its display is huge and super-bright. The good part is that I don't need to use night light anymore, because this alarm is a good substitute for one.Even though I'm not picky, the sound this unit delivers is really bad.The worst part is that only after 2 month of use some buttons on this alarm already don't work. When alarm goes off I sometimes need to unplug it from the outlet or it won't stop. Is not it too early considering that my old alarm clock broke after 5 years of use?UPDATE: This alarm has its own personality. It goes off only when it feels like it. The same applies to some bottons. They don't work."
1,"bright, poor audio quality, did i say BRIGHT","even though this radio is cheap, I still expected something, anything, and what I got is an extra bright night light that keeps my gf up, and as a consequence i'm looking for another decent alarm. Did i mention it runs slow for me? It slows about 1 min per day, which is not a good feature in an alarm clock"
2,Not as advertised....very disappointing.,"I purchased this because I wanted an easy to read clock that would play CD-Rs & CD-RWs. It does not play them even though it is supposed to. Also, when playing a regular CD that was a very loud humming sound in the background. I was very disappointed.The clock is easy to read and the radio seemed to work ok. But I wanted it for playing CD-Rs, so it is going back."
1,DONT BUY THIS!,"Blue screen is so bright that every night I have to put a blanket over it so that I can sleep...it literally lights up the whole room...I suppose it may be nice for young kids or people who like a nightlight. I personally like it dark.When you hit the snooze button the time on the clock ""loses"" a minute or so for each time you hit it. Every night I have to check the time on my cell phone in order to make sure the time is set accurately."
3,Ok quality for the price,I bought this clock radio for our office. The reception is better than our old radio and the digital tuning is much easier to use than a regular tuner. the display is only bright when the lights are off - not much help in an office. The blue numbers are difficult to see under the fluorescent lighting.
1,"Fifteen minutes, and the arm fell off!","Our son played with this toy for literally fifteen minutes after it arrived via UPS before the left arm fell off. Mind you - it fell off in his hands, not after being thrown or otherwise abused. I can't believe that something so badly constructed cost so much!"
1,"I had expected more, I suppose...","I had hoped to read a more extensive account of what the writer went through when her son became ""frum "". It is a kind of overview ,which is rather superficial and doesn't give me much insight into the mind of any of both parties .Of course , I agree , it is private - but nobody forced the writer to write this book , I think ?I also could have done without half of the -slim- book being dedicated to explanation of basic Jewish words.In short , there are ( when too few, I agree) better books on the subject."
5,A Gentile Point of View,"What a delightful book! I only wish I'd been able to read something like this years ago. It would have helped me so much in understanding more about my Orthodox Jewish friends. It would have even been helpful in understanding more about my Reform Jewish friends. Now that I HAVE read it, I will be much more cognizant of the traditions and laws of Judaism. A great book for anyone interested in learning more about Judaism, without getting bogged down in a heavy, complicated learning process. Just a purely enjoyable and informative book."
4,Good Stuff,"these are a good pair of undies. good looking waist band and a comfy 100% cotton fit. One thing i noticed on these, compared to other pairs of CK's, is that the pouch on these is huge! maybe its just my pair but there is plenty of room in this pouch (and im not small by any means). Not really a complaint, its very flattering"
3,go for the trunks,"these are some of the best underwear that i have owned, but the calvin klein trunks are better; not as long."
3,"About as exciting as ""Masquerade""","I saw this movie while riding on a bus from Puerto Vallarta to Tepic in central Mexico. For 80's made for tv anti-terrorism drama, it's not too bad. It holds up better over time than its contemporary, Airwolf. The only point of interest of this movie is that the guy who plays Josh Lyman on West Wing appears in it. I can't imagine why he leaves this off his bio on the NBC website. Next time you see him, be sure to go ""Hey, it's that guy from C.A.T. Squad!"" Then plead ignorance if he mentions his other work."
5,"Very Realistic, and logical","Machiavelli is an amazingly logical thinker. The book constantly stresses ""the way humans act and should act are seldom the same"". This book will be able to help you understand why some acts, although terrible and highly immoral, are necessary. Machiavelli pays little or no attention to morality and focuses only on how to get the job done, for in Machiavelli's time, the moral choices would more often than not lead to ones own death.The book has an excellent intro, and is has numerous annotations. I gave the book 5 stars, because I think everyone should read this book. This book references real historical events and will open your eyes in ways that you would of never thought possible."
4,Brutal!,"Machiavelli was the first to say what everybody had been doing for centuries. His no mercy, blunt way of how the Prince should run his kingdom is the first real sign of a realist. I would recommend it because its a quick and interesting read. You may need to familiarize yourself with the politics of Florence at the time of Machiavelli to fully understand his references, but it would still be interesting regardless."
4,the prince,"Without a doubt, Nicolo Machiavelli has to be the most dissembling, evil man I've ever read. Though he covers it well in his constantly changing subjects and demeanor I would have not wanted to be around him in the 16th century. I would have never trusted him not to ensnare me in one of his plots!"
5,A Guide for Today's politicians to gain and keep power,"I first thought that the main purpose of the book was the need Machiavelli part in politics. He had a love for the ""art."" As I further read I found out that his love for politics has enabled him to create a masterful plan of becoming an guide for today's politics."
3,From the viewpoint of a high school Sophmore...,"Being as though it's on our school's required reading list, we have to buy a copy and read it.I would have no problem if the book wasn't so boring.The book talks about how a country should be ruled if it were to be successful, and he does it rather well. The only problem is he doesn't make it interesting.I've forced myself through a majority of the book and I still don't see a real point in reading it.Machiavelli might have been one of the best political writers in his time, but I have to say, let bygones be bygones."
1,Suffering from insomnia? Read this book!,"This is probably one of the most backwards and boring books I've ever read. It is a complete waist of time, unless you plan on becoming some sort of ruler, and even then I'd pass it up. Steer clear of this one."
1,Piece of trash!,this book is the most confusing & stupid book i have ever read! i had to finish it thought because my teacher made us do a book review on it! i hate this book i wish it would die!
1,An Un-interesting Book,this book isn't that bad... i mean... i've never read a book like this. this book talked of how a prince is suppose to act and stuff! ow gosh... this was a very boring book.... maybe fun and interesting for those with a mind for conquering or trying to persuade people to love them... great for political people.... but for me... and i maybe speakin for others... this was a very boring book.... I don't like the way Machiavelli wrote this... this was just to help him with his reputation... i guess i don't think very brillantely.... well... it was ok... but not good to read just for fun.. cuz it's not fun...
3,"Not bad, but not a business book","I read The Prince because, like Sun Tzu's The Art of War, it is often listed as a worthwhile book about management. Well, I found it reasonably interesting (as was the case with The Art of War), but in the context of history or political science, not in the context of management. In fact, it has very little, if anything, to do with management, except for one or two ideas regarding matters like people management and vigilance in times of good fortune. Machiavelli is an early proponent of realpolitik, and some of his ideas are, to put it mildly, ethically dubious if viewed from a business/management perspective. I would think that the last thing the major Western economies need at this point are (more) Machiavellian managers!I enjoyed the foreword to the edition I read, which I think is the Wordsworth edition, not the one listed here. It sets out nicely the context within which Machiavelli wrote the book without being too detailed."
4,Great introduction to politics.,The Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli is a great introduction to politics. Machiavelli encourages rulers to do what is expedient rather than what is moral.
4,Political Power,"Men should be either treated generously or destroyed, because they take revenge for slight injuries - for heavy ones they cannot.That was a famous Machiavelli quote, that shows how little human nature has changed over the years. In fact many of the maxims Machiavelli wrote about nearly 500 years ago are sill very much in play today.In the book ""Quotes:from the Cunning and the Powerful"" Machiavelli is quoted more than any other person, second only to Napolean."
4,Must be understood in context,"Many reading this classic do not account for Machiavelli's personal circumstances when employing these strategies, and thus achieve a dangerous half-understanding of his advice. Remember, he was an unemployed political consultant, exiled to an agrarian existence by the man this treatise advises. Hence, this text was designed as a covert form of revenge and to lay the groundwork for his future employment.To achieve these aims, Machiavelli selected a set of strategies & historical examples that achieve striking yet misleading short-term results, but end in the long-term attrition of their implementer. Thus, Lorenzo was impressed with the effectiveness of these strategems, yet he would soon require Machiavelli's expertise to extricate himself from the unforseen consequences of his actions.When read in the proper context, this book illustrates well how to mislead a powerful person with deceptively simplified stratagems & historical metaphors, yet not get caught at it."
3,How to an effective leader,"The prince has recently been pushed as being similar to ""The Art of War"" in its aplicability to succeeding modern life. However, aside from a few insights, I found the book to be largely bland. Machiavelli makes a point and goes into stories which resemble ""the begats"" in the Old Testament. Unless you are well versed the European history of this period, you will probably want to skip those passages. Even the though the passages are relatively short, they seem too drag on too long.The book does make some very valid points about being a prince which could translate into being a leader in the modern world. However, these passages don't really make reading the book worth the time. The Art of War is much more insightful."
2,I've read worse books for class...,"This book is more or less a sort of handbook that Machiavelli wrote for future rulers. In it, he breaks down different styles of ruling, different military defenses, and many other things, all the while using historical examples. One of the reasons it has remained so popular is because of Machiavelli's lack of morals included in his ideas. In addition, the book is easy to read and interesting to most because rulers up to the last century had been known to read it. It's not exactly exciting reading, but it's surely interesting for those who like history."
2,A classic?,"This book did not hold my interest. Machiavelli does make some good points about politics, but his writing style failed to hold my interest. I don't have much else to say about this book. I apologize if this review was not helpful to you."
3,the root of modern polity,"if anyone doesnt like the way modern politics works, you can put the blame right at Miachiavelli's feet. his ""real world"" view of politics changed the way princes related to each other in Europe and then later, in the world. thankfully we have improved on his views somewhat, but he began it all with his short book."
3,"The book had water damage, and shipment took more than it was supposed to.",I was not satisfied with the book because it had water damage. Overall it was an okay sale. I expected the book to be in a better condition
4,Read it in school...,Hey. I read a part of this in school for World Civilizations class and for an assingment we had to change parts into our own words and once we did that it was SO much easier to understand what Machiavelli was trying to say. It was very interseting.
4,"Great read, very interesting.","Enjoyed this book, it was not too difficult to read, it is an excellent copy. I would recommend this book to everyone."
4,Should be read by all,"Not just for the history value, but the common sense he struggles with. I think there are so many things that this can apply to, but most people can't get over thinking of this as a guide for royalty. It still has value today."
5,"Change ""Prince"" for ""Boss"", and...","If we substitute some words, like ""Director"" where it says ""Prince"", and ""lay-off"" instead of ""kill"", we get a book that explains how -to stay in power-, it is necessary to be in good terms with the people, how influences help, how change is very difficult to achive, and many other great advices.This book is a jewel. It shows how technology evolves, and people remain mostly the same, no matter the date."
2,hard read,"This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself."
2,Better than Nytol,"I had to read this book for my AP European History class, and I thought that this book was great... for putting you to sleep. I was additiced to Nytol, but I kick the habit with this book. Yes, there are some very good ideas that this book talks about: war, leadership, backstabbing, etc. What you should know is once you start reading this book, you will find tha language very hard to understank, and if you did bad on the SAT, your in tough luck. Good luck to those who will try to read ""The Beast."""
1,Read with caution.,"After reading this book, I am convinced of two things: that the author presents a compelling description of how a ruler should maintain his rule over his subjects; and that if holders of political power take the author's advice, mankind would once again be reduced to living under absolute despotism.Among his many recommendations to the Prince, Machiavelli suggests that the Prince order his armies to slaughter any people who have before tasted freedom. For, as he argues, they will always rise against a ruler who would oppress them.From such a recommendation, is it not apparent that Mr. Machiavelli would like to see mankind enslaved, rather than free? Despite this, Machiavelli is often praised for his candidness and pragmatism!And what does Mr. Machiavelli seek from the Prince in exchange for the ""gift"" of his advice? Why, riches, of course, that the Prince's armies would plunder from the people under the Prince's rule."
2,Hard to read.,"A bore. Maybe just because I had to read it for class, and I hated the teacher, but I had an awful time with this book."
2,"Machiavelli - Winner of the 1rst ""Ass-Kiss Rodeo?""","Definitely a book to read to help you get up in the corporate world.I will be making this a staple in my bookshelf of references in surviving corporate culture, I encourage you to add it to yours."
4,Definately a classic.,"If you have been told something was ""Machiavellian"", but never knew what it meant, you must read this book. A little dry (reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but a great insight into the mindset of the privileged in 16th century Europe. Because of this, it is a great read; especially for history buffs, but also for anyone who is interested in what goes on inside the mind of a great leader (or even not so great leader, [cough, cough]). Once again, though, there is no substitute for a classic."
3,Good content - poor layout,"I have to echo the opinion of the reviewer who complained about the layout of this book. While the content is good, with an abundance of illustrations, I found it quite frustrating to follow text passages that reference illustrations located 8 to 10 pages ahead. It appears that little or no effort was made to locate pictures and drawings on pages near the relevant text. While this may seem trivial to some, I consider it a serious flaw that detracts from an otherwise excellent tutorial on table saw basics."
3,"Good information, but Bad Layout makes it a difficult read","The information in this book is very good. What keeps it from being really excellent choice is the lack of COLOR photos and the frustrating layout of the text.There are numerous references to the black-n-white photos (e.g. ""Fig. 4-5"", or ""Fig. 6-8"") that are rarely found on the same page that references them. This results in a constant search - as much as 4 pages ahead(!) - for the photo that the text is refering to. In some cases, there is no reason for not including the photo on the same page. It's a maddening back-n-forth scramble all over the book.Whomever put this book together was an ..., and did the author a disservice."
4,A good read!,"This novel has some interesting, off-beat secondary characters. It's good to see Hispanic characters that are not stereotypes. Sweet story line without being too predictable."
2,Bad 2nd Disc Audio,"Well disc 1 of 2 on this Blu-Ray set was great. Good video, but not Blu-Ray quality and great digital sound. Disc #2, well can't say anything but that it will not load after repeated tries. Could be that stacking two discs on one spindle wouldn't be a great idea, but this one was on the bottom.UPDATE: In taking the #2 disc out to check for dust, scratches, etc., I find a really, really thin piece of tape stuck to the playing surface. Removed it, clean the disc and it plays. Sorry, but you still lose a couple of stars because of the tape stuck to the disc, the lack of audio on the bonus track, and the unthinkable stacking of one disc on top of another."
1,Poor Quality DVD,"I concur with Luke's review, everything he says goes double for me. DVD's both are very scratched up and on the second DVD there is no sound for one of the key segments when they are jamming in the dressing room. Amazon should not sell this specific product. I thought maybe Luke's came from a different seller under the umbrella of Amazon but when I got my DVD in Early Sept. 2012, it was the same poorly packaged DVD and to boot mine did not even have tape to hold the DVD's in place. I will not go through the trouble of sending it back. I ordered another copy of an older version release which cost me 25 dollars instead of the 17 I just spent but hopefully all the sound is present and the dvd`s are in good shape. Please Amazon remove this from your buyer list."
1,"Poor Quality, Packaging","This product was clearly not an original as I was replacing a copy that I had owned for years and scratched. I was disappointed for a few reasons. First of all this is a two DVD set. It came in a case intended for one disc and had both scotch taped into the one spot. Very disappointing. The other elements, such as the slightly scratched disc and the poorly printed cover just show how cheaply this was made. This is the first time I was disappointed with Amazon. I don't mind getting a knock off as long as the quality is good but this disappointed on all levels. I figured it wasn't worth the time to send back."
4,Pleased with my purchase,I was pleased to see the avalablilty of what I was looking for. I am also pleased with my purchase
4,Atencion es una reedición,"Es imprescindible informar sobre las reediciones este DVD es del 2003, lo compre pensando que era material nuevo, porque aparecia como novedad. Por favor informen más y mejor!!!"
4,track selection,"I have no complaints about what is here, only about what is missing. The nights chosen to record this DVD were amazing shows....but what was left out was Layla!!!!! Come on! How could that be left off this DVD?!?"
4,Still Solid After All These Years,"Gregg Allman is in great voice. Butch and Jaimoe are steady and playful as ever. And at the risk of treading on sacred ground, I must say Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks recall Duane and Dickie peaking at Fillmore East, though, let's face it, nothing will ever match the freshness and fluidity of those early performances of high-octane blues. I was especially knocked out by the energy and good humor of Statesboro Blues. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to visit an old friend and appreciate the flowering of a virtuoso in Derek Trucks. The smiles exchanged by Allman and Haynes when the youngster plays say it all."
5,The Gregg Allman Band delivers the goods,"I have to admit i was not happy when brother Dickey was kicked out of the band as i felt he was a major contributor to the bands success, that said, i watched this concert and was blown away by the great musicianship of Warren Haynes and the excellent slide work of Derek Trucks. I especially liked ""instrumental illness"" which shows us again how great these guys are at long jam sessions. I wish they would have thrown in a few more of the old classics like Les Brers in A Minor, Elizabeth Reed and Jessica but i guess they (Gregg) didnt want to do any of Dickey's songs. Dreams and Whipping Post are also highlights of this Beacon Theatre concert."
5,Back to the classic days,I grew up on the original Allmans lineup and even saw Duane at Manhattan Center and the Fillmore within 6 months of his untimely passing. Live at the Fillmore was a peak for the band which they have never really approached. The greater the influence of Dicky Betts on their sound the further away from their blues roots they strayed and the greatest band on the planet plummeted into mediocrity. Firing the doped up Betts has breathed new life into the Allmans as Derek Trucks has a sound and style which elevates the Bros back to their glory years. My son and i attended a few Allmans shows with Trucks and they were the best concerts i have seen in at least 25 years. The dvd captures the excellence and the dynamic sound of the current lineup. For the old time Allmans fan revel in the return to the glory days. For the hillbilly drugged up dickey betts fan you can go see him fumbling through a set with his group.
5,They still can jam!,"The close-ups of the guitar playing really shows what this band is all about. There is so much talent and they still have the ability to pull in an audience, even without all the original band members. Derek Trucks makes it look so easy. He is truly amazing and Dickie Betts is the one who lost out by leaving this band. The audience are true winners. Sure, Greg's voice has more ""maturity"" now but that happens to all of us. One great product!"
5,I agree with top-reviewer Bill Thompson but...,"I couldn't have asked for a better quality DVD concert release from the ABB than this. The purpose of this release was to show how dynamic and powerful the band has carried on since the passing of original guitar blazer Duane Allman, and more recently Dicky Betts. All of their classics are not represented here, which is true. But the only classic songs left are the ones Dicky Betts penned such as Ramblin' Man, In Memomry, Melissa, etc., and I feel the band is carrying on without him in the band and without his songs with their live repetroire. As for recent newby, Derek Trucks, I believe he is filling Duane's shoes, not Dicky's, as he played along side Dicky for a few years in the ABB prior to Dicky's exit. Derek is quite possibly the greatest slide guitarist in the ABB since Duane Allman (which is in no way a dismis on Warren Hayes). This DVD releaseis everything I dream of in a concert release. Just brillant. You have to get this."
3,IN A WORD,"In a word, WHO are you? Evolving from this question we have here a new art form. More than that, here is a venture into the challenge of identity. One hundred individuals were asked, ""What ONE word defines you? As ( Pastor) Laura spoke with and listened to each one during the ""identity"" session, photographer ( and Pastor) William captured each individual on film. Their combined skills were agents to clarify, record, and present one hundred LIVING WORDS. This is a new art form which prompts thoughtful response."
3,More of a comment,Don't really see how they can sell a true HHS High Speed Steel Tap & Die set for ~ $150.00.Wonder if Grizzly would be honest or really know if it was true HSS if I called and asked them?http://www.amazon.com/Grizzly-G9770-pc-Inch-Metric/dp/B0000DD0QW
3,It's Ok For What It Is...,"I bought this just to find out what was on it. It is an ok disc, perhaps the music has not aged all that well? Anyway I've included a track listing for those of you interested in such.

4,Easy to install.,"The lock was very easy to install. It serves it's purpose, but the materials could be a little more heavy duty."
2,What the...,"This product would have been fine if it actually looked like the picture!! The glass is absolutely clear, where as the picture shows it as amber... did they send me the wrong product?? This is a joke"
2,Be warned: finish not what it appears,"This is a well-made and attractive lamp. However, the metal finish is not bronze as stated, it is mottled brown and green with whitish highlights as if you left metal polish on it. It isn't hideous but it isn't at all what I expected based on the photos and description. Better photos are definitely needed."
5,Buy two You will be glad you did.......,"As an owner of a lot of Fiestaware this one piece is something I bought two of. One in Sea Mist and one in yellow. The yellow is a light yellow more like a pale lemon. The one thing I noticed right away was how balanced the carafe is when it has liquid in it. Easy to carry and pour from.I think the size of the opening aids in the balance and ease of pouring.We have Fiestaware dinner sets in a variety of colours and use it as our daily dishes as well as outside around the deck and pool and inside for small casual gatherings. The colours are what make these dishes so fun to use and if you have a variety of colours they enliven a table like no other dishes can.The carafe holds a healthy 60 ounces and we have served everything from coffee to french lavander lemonade in ours and the hot liquids stay hot and the cold liquids stay cold, longer. And the item is easy clean as well."
5,Wow!,"The photo does not do this piece justice! My jaw dropped when I first pulled it out of the box. The color is beautiful, as is the styling, it feels good in hand, and is as sturdy as Fiestaware's reputation. I haven't however, used it yet, but from years of experience with this company's pieces I'm betting on it's efficiency."
1,Wrong Items Shipped,"I absolutely love Amazon. After several years of ordering from Amazon (mostly books), this S'more set was the first item I ordered that arrived incorrectly. I received the grilling s'more but not the lawn-mowing one. After a week of going back and forth filling out forms with Amazon, I finally found out that a replacement would be shipped. It arrived today. Still no lawn-mowing s'more. Instead, I received two Cowboy S'mores. The receipt said that it was the Summer Ornaments, Set of 2.Also, I ordered the following, which arrived exactly as they should:Seasons of Cannon Falls S'Mores Crafty Ornaments, Set of 3Seasons of Cannon Falls S'Mores Sport Ornaments, Set of 4Seasons of Cannon Falls S'Mores Cooking Angel Ornaments, Set of 3Seasons of Cannon Falls S'Mores Summer Fun Ornaments, Set of 3If you want to order the Seasons of Cannon Falls S'Mores Summer Ornaments, Set of 2, you're better off spending more money and getting them from a supplier that checks the boxes before shipping."
4,Page Turning Thriller,"This was my first Douglas Preston book & my first introduction to the character Pendergast. Lately I had been choosing books that I could not finish because they were too slow (and I hate that), but this book was not one of those! This was a great page turner that kept me reading & interested till the very end. I was literally up at 2 and 3am reading this & I work full time & have an infant daughter. And of course there's a cliff hanger that'll keep me reading the other books till who knows when! But I love it. I'll definitely be checking out his other novels.I gave it 4 stars b/c towards the end it did drag out, but still good nonetheless."
3,Entertaining,"I leafed through the book in an airport bookstore (so you know I wasn't looking for a Pulitzer Prize winner to begin with) and was delighted to find that Preston/Child finally seem to have grasped the concept of limited 3rd person narrative, so I set out to read ""Brimstone"".Since I am one of those people who can never figure out who did it in whodunits, I was quite content to plod along with a story that was even lengthier than my layover and enjoyed watching most of it unfold through D'Agosta's eyes (I can't help it, I like him - LOL).In short: I didn't have high expectations when I bought this book, so I wasn't disappointed when I finished it. After several Pendergast/D'Agosta books, I also have finally got used to Pendergast's Gary Stu'ishness and don't find him quite as annoying anymore. HOWEVER, the motive for the murders in ""Brimstone"" was too farfetched even for my severely relaxed standards.""Brimstone"" is a nice easy airport read. I wish I hadn't paid $17 for it, though."
4,Just Right,"The book as an 1890's feel to it but is set in the present. The case the hero investigates has a preternatural aura but the hero (almost a superhero) and his more ordinary side kick attack it as an ingenious crime and not the work of the devil. This is the first Prendergast novel I've read and I enjoyed it. There are details that really resonated with me, Prendergast has what looks like an abandoned mansion in Harlem that is picture perfect on the inside. It's just a cool idea that someone would do that (only in a novel, I don't think it would work in real life). Such quirks scattered throughout the book just make the whole thing more interesting. Near superheros and near perfect bad guys make the book a fun read."
2,Good action ... only an OK story...,"Agent Pendergast is just too eccentric for my tastes, I guess. He seems to know everything about everything, has unbelievable luck, and I just can't be made to care about him. There are some nice twists and turns in the story, that keep you guessing.. but the ultimate 'cause' of some very interesting and bizzare deaths that appear to be Satan himself, was ultimately a real letdown for me. I felt like I was missing 'something' the entire story because I'd not read any of the previous Agent Pendergast stories... and there are lots of references that probably would have made a lot more sense to me (or that I'd care about) if I had... and Preston leaves you hanging at the end ridiculously just to set up another book."
1,Not up to snuff -,"Normally, I enjoy Preston/Child books. This was a very disappointing read in comparison to other Preston/Child books. The premise is very interesting - devil collecting his dues or spontaneous combustion? Unfortunately the story just plods along. Too much filler existed between the action scenes, and Agent Pendergast is actually boring in this book. I only made it a little past the half-way point and I'm skipping pages. Please, do yourself a favor and read other Preston/Child books like, The Relic or my favorite, Thunderhead which have stronger plot lines and more interesting characters.."
2,"over-hyped, and as far from good writing as one can get!!!","it's been awhile since i've read a preston/child offering, but my recollection of Relic and Thunderhead is that both were far more literate and left no loose ends...wish i could say the same for Brimstone, which began to annoy me from the first few chapters. Another reviewer has allready noted the problem with Constance (from Cabinet of Curiosities) but the omission of detail regarding her presence in wren's and pendergast's lives is nowhere near as aggravating as the HORRENDOUS dialogue.what is meant to pass as coarse repartee among the various men in blue falls terribly flat as do the authors' repetitive word choices; if i had a nickel for every time the word ""cadaverousness"" appeared, i'd be a wealthy woman, although i suppose points could be given for using it as a descriptor of people AND places.overall, this book disappointed me. word to the wise...ignore the blurb on the dust jacket; wait for the paperback, if you bother at all!"
3,"No, not like ""Relic""","The trouble with ""series"" novels is that the quality gets sacrificed at the alter of the readers' demand for more, and the writers' tendency to make hay as long as the sun exists. This novel, the 1st one of the trilogy featuring the Pendergast duo, suffers from the same malady. It tries to incorporate a lot of stuff into the basic fabric of an action-packed novel, that is also a (sort of) homage to ""The Moonstone"". But overall, not good, despite being better than most other dime-a-dozen techno-thrillers, since it falls short of the gold standard set by ""Relic""."
4,ENTHRALLING AND FRIGHTENING NOVEL,"I had thoght that some of the collaborations between these authors were extending and over-written. I am now convinced that their mysteries are a genre of a certain specificity and intrigue that defy description - I, for one, am convinced that they,they authors, can only now go on to more elaborate and intriguing heights.Timothy Wingate, OTTAWA CANADA"
2,Didn't like it,"Sorry, but this one dragged too slowly for me. I generally like Preston/Child's books, and this one had a GREAT premise. Maybe I was expecting too much. It seemed to fly off in a dozen directions, taking forever to get back around to the parts I was interested in, namely, the Devil coming for his bought-and-paid-for souls. I thought the logic was weak in many places. For example, the protagonists follow a millionaire around the world and break into his compound, based on very weak evidence that he may have information about a murder. Since a huge chunk of the story was about their pursuit and I didn't buy the pursuit in the first place, I found it tedious to keep reading. I kept thinking, it's almost there, almost the story I wanted it to be--with foreign locales, historical tidbits that tied into the present, interesting characters--but ultimately, it let me down. I think it was trying to be a bigger story than it needed to be, and the authors just couldn't keep it together."
3,Good But Tangled,This book had alot of promise with a great story line but it just did not flow from begining to end. Too many lose ends and not clear on how the main detectives came to their conclusions.
2,Yuck,"The story (what I read of it) was okay, but the language was so bad that I skipped over about 1/3 to 1/2 of the book. I was interested in how it turned out, so I read the ending. It was only semi-satisfactory."
3,Definitely worth reading but........,"Preston and Child's earlier books are such hard acts to follow. BRIMSTONE is a good read but not quite as good as their earlier work. It just rather drug along for me at times but as always it is a joy to see our favorite sleuths off on new adventures. I always learn something new and interesting in a P & C book and this one is no exception. Their use of language is always fresh and rich as chocolate. Can't wait to see the next one, Happy Writing Gentlemen!"
4,ALWAYS CONSISTANT.,"Well it is late Summer again and we know that means that Lincoln/Child will be back....and here is Brimstone. One thing I love about these guys is that no matter how they tell a story, some good, some bad, but they are good over all compared to the rest of the junk that's out there. This is Brimstone a story of murder, mystery, intrigue and great settings. In this novel we have the teaming up of Agent Prendergrast and Vincent D'Agusta after a strange mystery of bodies that have seemingly spontaneously combusted. How, these things happen always are the thing that appeal to me in their novels. I strongly recommend Brimstone, though it is not the best they have written it is up there."
2,Terrible prose combined with cliche dialogue,"While it is very well researched, this book is cliche and boring. The plot requires you to not only suspend disbelief but to completely ignore it.The dialogue is cliche cop-talk, and the descriptions are juvenile. I endured this only because I assumed it would get better towards the end--it didnt."
4,BRIMSTONE,Glad I finished it in one day. It's tough holding ones breath that long.Although Pendergast is becoming an almost 'Bond' like superhero with Houdini escapes he is still barely believable.Can't wait for the appearance of the brother.
4,Preston/Child begin a new adventure with old favorites,"I have always been a fan of Douglass Preston and Lincoln Child. Brimstone beings a new adventure that spans several novels, however each maintains the quality of a fully developed story with a complete start and finish.Characters that appear in earlier novels return in Brimstone, but they are re-introduced in such a way that a new reader will have no trouble catching on. Having read a plethora of Preston/Child stories, Brimstone stands out for me as one of my favorites to date. The characters are vibrant, the plot is fast-paced, and the story is gripping. For fans of mysteries, this book is a must."
4,Brimstone,"This was a really good book. Well, until the end. I was almost convinced that the phenomenon causing deaths in the book was really supernatural, and I couldn't wait to see how that would be handled ! Then the book started to wrap everything up a bit too quickly at the end. I didn't really buy into the premise that the lost violin could have put everything in motion, and a full 30 years in advance. I really enjoyed most of the book, however, and the investigation was very good. I also enjoyed the globe-hopping. I am a fan of the series, and still enjoyed the book. Ultimately, however, I did not find the villain convincing enough."
4,Good... But not as good as Cabinet of Curiosities,"I am very fond of the Preston and Child books. If you have not read them I strongly encourage you to do so. This book was good but not as good as Cabinet of Curiosities, although I still really enjoyed it. The main character, Agent Pendergast, is a very intelligent and interesting character. Brimstone makes several references to the earlier Agent Pendergast books. You will not be ""lost"" if you read this before the others, but it does make for a more interesting story. Overall I was indecisive an whether to give this books 3 or 4 stars. I was left slightly disappointed simply because, in my opinion, the earlier Pendergast books where more enjoyable. If you are interested in the science and archeology related mysteries presented in the earlier books, you too, will be slightly disappointed. I would still recommend it to friends however. If you have not read Cabinet of Curiosities, I would recommend that book over this one."
2,If a protagonist has no way out,"I always looked forward to the next novel of Preston & Child, but this one was dissapointing. The mysteries are to obvious except for the motivation of the evil genius. Furthermore integration of a bored wealthy bonvivant, an illegal weapon deal, James Bond like production plants, intrusions in deserted factories and ancient italian nobility is simply too much; even for Preston and Child. Up till now i liked the twisting of technological fiction, reality, crime and some elements of horror as a good read. But this is overdone and sometimes even ""unwanted"" funny. I think it is always a problem to create a hyper-super hero like Pendergast, because he has no way to develop. Consequently the setting must become more and more absurd and unbelievable."
2,Oh how the mighty have fallen,"I really loved ""Relic"" and have followed these two ever since. I was pretty disappointed with this installment. Pendergast is just becoming a ludicrous figure, eccentric to the point of utter unbelievability. These books are becoming a parody of their former thrillers. It seems to me that the works of every extremely popular author just tend to deteriorate over time. This book is still better than some I've read, but is very long winded and I am having the hardest time involving myself in the story. I will finish it since I am about 3/4 of the way through, but if I knew how bad this was going to be, I wouldn't have started it in the first place. Good luck!"
2,Sure to be a Jerry Bruckheimer Movie,"I admit, I really wanted to like this book especially since I enjoy novels with a supernatural flair. It started off at a great pace, with enough hooks to keep me reading. Unfortunately, around page 350, I realized there were just too many plot-threads, characters and unbelievable cliff-hangers. Quagmire accomplished! I guess I just found Agent Pendergast too perfect, too much: a combination of Sherlock Holmes and James Bond. If you like your stories with more fluff than intelligence, then you'll probably like this book.I also found the ending to be yet another cliff-hanger and unsatisfying. I do admit though I will pick up the next book in the series just to see what happened to one of the main characters. While the two authors are much more talented than I, they've cemented my negative knee-jerk reaction to works of fiction written by two authors (especially since I quit reading ""The Relic"" about 90% into the book)."
1,Comic Book,"I agree with the reviewer who compared this to a superhero comicbook. I read all of it but couldn't wait to be done with it so I could move on to something else. This the first book I have read by these authors, and needless to say, it will be my last."
1,A Comic Book,"This is a terrible book. Pendergast knows everything, charms everyone, has done everything, and is invincible. That sounds more like a comic book character than a human being. The weapon of concern is obvious almost from the start of the book . . only one kind of appliance will damage a body like that. What was all the mystery in the Riverside Mansion in New York City. That was never explained, nor were the people associated with it, namely his ward and the old man. Saving themselves from assassination was too ridiculous to be credible. Not only was Pendergast a comic book figure, the entire novel was of comic book quality. I kept on turning the pages hoping to find a reason why I was reading this book, but I never found it. Don't waste your time with this unless you like comic-books, and stories that have no real ending."
3,Anticlimax,"This book has a great plot as well as charismatic and compelling characters. From the first page the reader is drawn in, it's a real page turner, until the first of two mistakes are made. The first being the clumsy sex scene on page 188. It came out of nowhere, seemed completely out of place, implausible, as if a page from a bad supermarket romance novel somehow got mixed up in the manuscript. The second is the ending, I won't ruin it for anyone, but come on ! I felt the same way I feel after reading any book with a great story, but a terrible ending, cheated. Time is a precious thing, even more precious when it is lost to an outlandish, disappointing ending."
2,SORRY BUT I'M SPOILED...,"I'm sure I'm being unfair to the author, but I was spoiled by reading RELIC,STILL LIFE WITH CROWS, THUNDERHEAD and (to a lesser degree) RELIQUARY, which are among my favorite books in this genre. In comparison, I was underwhelmed by BRIMSTONE, DANCE OF DEATH, etc. I have just started Preston's TYRANNOSAUR CANYON, and I'm getting that same dragging feeling...It's not that it's not good, it's that it's not what you'd call a page-turner..."
4,Another Winner from Preston/Child,"I borrowed the CD audio version of this book from the library and listened to it while I drove. What a wonderful story. I love Pendergast so much, it was a pleasure to hear from him again. The reader (Scott Brick) for this version is just wonderful, and I love hearing him voice Pendergast (and his Italian was also very nice). In the author's note at the end they mention that one of the characters Count Fosco is from another novel,The Woman in White.. I may have to hunt that one down, as Fosco was an intriguing character."
4,Brimstone #1 of the Trilogy,By and of itself this was a great novel. As part of the trilogy it was definitely the best Pendergast plot the authors have penned. A must read for the FBI agents fans.
3,Brimstone,I had started listening to the Pendergast books a long time ago and have just recently been catching up on the earlier books. I find this book is well written and continues to build the Pendergast character.
4,Brimstone,"I wanted to get into the Diogenes part of the Pendergast story and so began here. I love the Preston/Child series, but this trilogy was REALLY involved!"
4,Excellent Book,I've only recently started reading the Pendergast series and am enjoying all of the books tremendously. Brimstone was fast paced and kept you guessing. The ending was quite unusual too.
4,brimstone,Loved this book!!!Pendergast is alway intresteng and different than most detectives.He is my kinda cop Have read all his stories love my fire
4,Larger than life cinematic fun,"The authors are such master craftsman (rarely a word out of place), and Pendergast is such an engaging character, and the pace is so consistently brisk, that one finds oneself forgiving all sorts of implausibilities and unlikely contrivances in the race to read more. Fragments of past and future Pendergast adventures provide an unfortunate distraction here, as does the increasingly James Bondian skills of our albino hero, but the tension, atmosphere, and history lessons are so deftly applied that it's churlish to complain. A fun thriller."
5,Great!,This was the first novel I had read by Preston and Child and it was brilliant! I like the intelligent yet mysterious agent Pendergast and the normal and sensible Vincent. The plot developed so well that I was unable to put the novel down. An enlightening and excitng journey.
3,Superstitions,"A mystery centered around an exceptionally perceptive sleuth sets the tone of this fast moving thriller. The detailed historical information brings authenticity to this adventure and shows the influence and power that superstition can and has had in escalating the fears of society.The main character dodges many life-threatening events, but leaves the reader questioning whether he was able to do it the final time. The authors, cleverly leaves the reader to create his own climax. An interesting approach."
4,They Should Just Put Pendergast in the Title!,"Special Agent Pendergast has evolved to be Preston & Child's focal point. In each of their novels they seem to release a little more information about him.In this book he has evolved to be the equal of Sherlock Holmes with a little bit of Houdini thrown in. He now has a police sidekick (Officer D'Agosta) just like Holmes had his Doctor Watson and the book sets up for a showdown with Pendergast's evil older brother (a la Mycroft Holmes).The book seems to go in several directions from devil conjurings to supernatural-like deaths to terrorists to valuable antiquities. Through it all, the authors seem to hit their stride with Pendergast and D'Agosta who make a nice complementary team. I know the authors are busy with a lot of solo projects these days but I hope they follow-through with the continuation that this book promises."
2,A disappointment,"I really enjoyed still life with crows and Cabinet of Curiosities, but this novel got downright dull and boring by the middle AND I thought the characterization of Agent Pendergast was even off a bit. I started skimming during the Florence section and to the end. this novel was a definite clunker in the series. I have begun Dance of Death and it is off to a good start... so I have higher hopes for it and will review it when I'm done..."
2,Used To Write Much Better Than This - Not Their Best..!,"Preston & Child have put out some memorable books in the past (Relic, Reliquary, IceLimit were all excellent!). However, they managed to fail miserably in their last 3 books - even though they had a very interesting character, Pendergast, to work with.BRIMSTONE only barely managed to hold my interest: the plot was stretched-out (the price of sequelization), the villains were obvious and all style, no substance. The side stories were but page-stuffing, they added nothing to the story or the characters' development - whereas, (the partial) catharsis came in the most predictable way possible!!This is another example of a story diluted to blandness, in order to milk the cash-cow until it bleeds...Disappointed. Again."
2,Brimstone,Not pleased. The dust cover was torn and taped back and I wasn't told that it was torn. Other than that the book is ok. I would not buy from this seller again.
3,Brimstone: Pick it up,"Brimstone: good bookThough the book was EXTREMELY boring in the beginning, it picks up fast, and then makes up for the boringness. It is amazing to see Pendergast's mind at work, and for all the crazy people who say he's invincible, the authors purposely did that so the image of Pendergast would still be a hero to everyone. Pendergast is definitely why anyone should read this book. Pendergast has humor, witts, knowedge, and is a combination of every single hero ever known. If you want a book with code and suspense, pick this up and read it!"
2,"Brimstone, not worth the wait","After almost a year waiting, and preordering the book, it let me down. There are serious gaps, like how and when did Constance become Pendergasts ward, and who confronted her first, Wren or Pendergast?Before you go ripping into me, I am a serious fan of the authors and have read all their books, even some several times.IMO it was not up to par.SKM"
1,The Woman In Brimstone,Count Fosco?...a fat Italian evil count?....uh.....can anyone say The Woman In White by Wilkie Collins?!?!?!?!?Can anyone say Literary Theft?Shame Shame Shame on 2 authors........and their publishers..... is the rest of the worldso illiterate that they assumed no one would notice?
2,Good at First,I rented this game and it was really fun and exciting at first but then all of a sudden I beat the game. It is really short so if you are one of those people that likes to drive cars and jeeps off road then this is the game for you.
3,"Better than the sequel, better as multiplayer","This game is actually fairly well done, even after the sequel was released. The terrain was done well, and the vehicles looked like the actual vehicles. The controls are relatively simple, and that's what makes this game a great multiplayer title. However, like Rockstar's current trend, the game is only good for shallow fun, as the game doesn' offer much depth. However, the game does get extremely difficult in the latter stages, nearly impossible to beat. After losing more than 30 times on one stage, this title became a backseat title. This game is exceedingly one of the best games out there -- for multiplayer. It does offer the most fun that I had in quite a while. However, Gran Turismo 3 IMHO is still one of the best multiplayer titles. If you are willing to venture into shallow games and great multiplayer games, this is one of the most fun!Note: Rent first. Buy later if you like it."
3,not everybody's cup of tea,"Ever dreamed of smuggling contraband across the border? Well, now you can.Except...well,that's ALL you do. For me, it just got a little irritating not being able to do more, like launching a missile into the nearest police car. Constantly running from the cops just gets old.Technally the game is amazing. Whatever object you see on the screen you can drive to it. Truly unlike anything i've ever seen in a video game. The graphics are excellent also, well beyond any other game of this type on any other system.Still,like I said, this not everyones cup of tea, so you may want to rent it first."
1,Smuggler Run What a letdown,"Terrible game, I had more fun playing RC pro am on my game boy, nothing like it reads to be, drive around in circles on 3 levels runnign through gates, with the cops chasing you, terrible graphics, no reason to even play this game again"
4,Good' un,"Hey this is my first review but I'm glad to be doing it on this game. I haven't bought Smuggler's Run yet, but I plan to. This is a very interesting game. I think (for car lovers especially) that it will amaze you. It's not a game that you'll beat right away because of the continual difficulty of the missions. But even if you do, you still have the turf war, joyride, and capture the flag. This is a game similar to Midnight Club Street Racing. Basicly they're the same game just one's outdoors and one's cities. So it depends which one you like. thanks..."
3,Another dissapointment,"With the slew of unfinished looking games coming out for the PS2, it seems like the developers are having trouble tapping into the power of the system. This may be the best of the launch titles, however that isn't saying much. Basically you're the new guy in the world of smuggling, you pick up and drop off the various packages while speeding around beautiful 3d landscapes. One highlight is that there is unlimited land for you to drive on. No invisible walls here. This game is very fun for awhile, running over animals, hitch hikers and various other breakable objects. The cars are just polygons with no real paint scheme or detail. Once the initial rush wears off, you're simply left with a somewhat prettier but much less in depth Grand Theft Auto."
2,Don't Judge a Book by its Cover,"At first look, I pictured Smugglers Run to be a action fun filled game, as soon as it loaded I knew I was wrong. The graphics are PS1 caliber, there is no plot to the game (in contrast to the backcover), and it is not ""fun"". I felted cheated... You can not compare this game to any other PS2 game I own. I was truely disappointed."
4,"Good, but not GREAT...","Basically, this game is the offspring of Driver and Crazy Taxi. You have to take valuable contraband across borders while avoiding the border patrol and other gangs. The graphix are awesome, but the gameplay could have been made a lot better and I feel they didn't use the full potential of the PS2. If the developers didn't rush to get this game out at the time of the PS2's launch, it could have been a lot better. If you liked Crazy taxi or Grand Theft Auto or anything like those, you are sure to like this game aswell, but if you aren't sure, get another game."
5,Great Game--definitely buy this one!,"The graphics--awesome, game play--too much fun (especially running over the cops), sound--a little repetitive (The female voice says the same things quite a lot). Overall, a must have for the PS2 owner. If you liked Crazy Taxi for the DC, then you will love this game."
3,a painfully average game,"Graphics: 4/5 - nice environments, cars are ok looking, the scenarios are rather boring thoughControls: 4.5/5 - i really have no complaints, it might be somewhat difficult to maneuver your car if cops are after you depending on how good you areStoryline: 2.5/5 - grand theft auto but much worse set in a rural setting, with completely linear gameplay. i'll never understand the story exactly.Fun: 2.5/5 - not all that enjoyable. it was a launch game though and the ps2 took a bit to get off the ground, so what do you expect, must rent before buying or be ready for dissapointment, dont expect it to be close to as good as is advertisedValue: 4/5 - used this game is almost nothing, and you can be plenty of people will be willing to sell, anything over 12 (maybe 15) is too much"
2,Where's the beef?,"This game sports great graphics. Beautiful worlds but no beef. This game will leave most gamers quite bored after about two hours of gameplay. All you do is drive from point A to point B. What this game really needed was weapons, enemies, and a variety in objectives. If you're thinking about this game, rent it or wait for a better game of its kind to come out."
3,Is this game really up to PS2 ??,"I got this game after reading the greats reviews regarding its fun. Well, at first I enjoyed it but then I got the feeling I was playing a game in the old PS1 console... The graphics and quality of the game are really poor in my opinion, compared to games like madden, for exemple and not up to the capacity of the PS2. Altough it gives much fun, I rather get other games that can explore the resources of the PS2, with better quality graphics..."
3,Guess who's back,"Mousse kidnaps ""AKane Tendo,"" but it ends up being her stuffed pig. The second time he's got it right though, and challenges Ranma again for the love of Shampoo. Getting the snot beat out of him (grrr), Mousse gives his best once more. I would have given this video 4 stars, but the art on this video wasn't the greatest, as if the animators were in a hurry to finish this one up. Another great video with a lot of Mousse is ""Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire."""
4,muddlesome mousse continues his piteous ploy,"A mysterious masked man kidnapps Akane... or actually her stuffed pig. Now Ranma must face the wrath of a very irate Mousse/duck. Can Ranma rescue Akane before she too becomes a duck? Or will He end up marrying a duck? The wackiness continues in the second half when Akane and Ranma decide to throw a fight so Mousse can win Shampoo's affection. However, will Ranma's male pride allow him to lose? Or, will Shampoo catch onto their scheme and decide to do a little fight-throwing herself? You cannot mis this hilarious adventure of love, extreme near-sightedness, and knife throwing circus ducks."
3,Good sound but the mount broke!,"I have two mounted outside for patio/pool coverage and they sound great. The problem is as reviewer #1 said, the wall mounts are plastic and one of mine is broken, hanging by the speaker cable. I can't find where to get a replacement mount. If you know where I can buy another one please email me! Thanks.Trixtektrixtek@comcast.net"
4,Nice Shoes and Very Comfortable,"These shoes generated a lot compliments; they are also very comfortable; I like them a lot. Florsheim was my shoe of choice for a long time...reasonably priced and a nice looking shoe. I then discovered Cole Haan, and I haven't purchased a pair of Florsheim since."
4,Back to the Bronx Blues,"Not as up beat as Yo Frankie. However, a good effort as Dion goes back to his roots."
4,really good,"You get the feeling Deetz is a bit of an ass, true, but the book speaks for itself; it's sensational. He gets right to the heart of the matter in the first pages: the truth about Thanksgiving is nothing like the perception. He brings the truth out of a morass of lies. Even in this time of greater accuracy in history-telling, Deetz's book stands out as a particularly honest approach. Yes, English people were responsible for the annihilation of the native population; that much even Jerry Falwell would acknowledge. But the fact that we cover it up and celebrate it with Thanksgiving is the sad part.There was a lot more happening in the 1620s than historians have allowed us to see."
3,Not a Martin's Hundred quality book,"Poor Deetz. His ego got in the way of a great book. There are some exceptional chapters... the one's that avoid his own personal agenda or self publicity attempts.Yes, our view of the past does needs to be reconsidered, but the attempt to set the record straight is not helped when one, such as Deetz, wants to remind the general reader how ""correct"" he is, vice those of lessor talent.As for the title, one gets the impression that he was also referring to himself. Deetz has done good work and can be justly proud of his achievements. But his self publicity makes one appreciate all the superb works of Ivor Noel Hume, such as Martin's Hundred and The Virginia Experience."
4,Who Needs G-d,"Well, I have to let you know that I had some difficulty getting into this book. That lasted all the way through the introduction. The only reason I gave this book four stars was that I had some difficulty following the author's train of thought at times. I am reading the book for the second time. I have found this book excellent for focusing on my own doubts on being Jewish and my relationship or lack there of between myself and G-d. This book provided the perspective I needed to reach inside and think of my own needs and the needs that G-d may have for me. This book is a great read and one that you will like to own."
1,Soles disintegrate,"Bingo! Took my Eccos out for winter wear only to find big chunks of the sole falling off as other reviewers have noted. Musta been a bad batch of gum... Worn maybe two dozen times. Eccos are usually winners. Ah, so. Their workers in the Peruvian jungle messed up..."
1,Pure crap,"I have 4 other pairs of Ecco shoes which are great shoes. I bought these about 3 months ago. I have worn these about 12 times. Maybe twent-five miles, and the soles are disintegrating. They might last me three months if I do not wear them.What a disapointment. I'll look for a different brand."
2,soles fail in 2 years,"The problem with ECCO shoes is the sole. They just don't last more than two years and when they fail it is a total failure. I have several pairs and each has been re-soled at a cost of $70. They are great looking comfortable shoes, but plan on the re-soling cost within a couple years."
4,ECCO Men's Seawalker Tie-up shoe,"Good, lightweight, comfortable shoe that appears well made. Grip on sole is good even when wet and wearing this shoe all day is no problem thanks to the soft leather upper which moulds to one's foot. Breathes well and stays cool."
3,do they have quality issues??,"i have worn eccos for about 20 years. my current pair ive had for 6 years, and the soles look like new. There is some stitching coming out on the top front of one, but thats easily repaired.Back in 1996, I had a pair where the soles fell apart, but the company replaced them. I thought the problem was short-lived, but I read in these reviews that the company is not replacing them.that is disturbing.i am at a loss to know what to do. i will probably risk it.jb"
4,Mens Seawalker,Have worn them two weeks and I am very happy . Shoes are comfortable and well made. I wear them all day have had no problems except my wife who says they look like old men's shoes. I told her I am an old man and she agreed.
3,Good But Some Flaws,"I bought a pair of Seawalkers to use for weddings as I am a professional photographer.Pros: Leather body and sole has held up with four years of hard use; comfortable shoe; nice fit; non-slip soleCons: Eyelet grommets were sharp-edged so lacings frayed within a few months (had to take to a cobbler to fix the problem); rubber sole squeaks on linoleum and hard wood floors; expensive compared to similar quality ECCO shoes.Overall, nice shoes but suede begins to get old looking after a year or so. I have therefore purchased another ECCO shoe, the Boston lace-up, for wedding work. I would give the Seawalker 4-stars for comfort but having to pay a cobbler more money to fix the eyelets was a bummer, particularly on such an expensive shoe, so 3-stars in my book."
3,No Half Size,"Purchased through Amazon, who made a quick delivery.The Black Seawalker Tie Oxford, (made in Slovakia) has sufficient and comfortable leather.The shoes have good arch support, and are comfortable for standing on concrete for 8 hours.Oversize single stitch mfg on the upper, appears somewhat fragile, and possibly prone to snags.Single sizing (no half size offered) appears to produce a larger than usual shoe. My ordinary size 9 becomes a size 9-9.5 in this shoe, creating a generous toe space."
2,Dissapointed with color,"I was so excited about my purchase until I got the product. The picture of the shoe doesn't match the color of the real product. It is like got switched. I already changed the product once, so I didn't want to do it twice. Next time, I will suggest buying the product in a store where you can see what you are buying..."
4,Seemed like good shoes.,These seem like good shoes. Unfortunitley I had to send them bac. I feet are wide and these were to tight to weas. I think they are OK other than that.
1,Are these shoes made in China?,"Are these shoes in made in China? Or are any of the parts to put the shoes together made in CHINA? I hear these shoes are not like the old and last only about 2 years compared to 10 years pre-china manufacture - if so then, does that mean little children are making these products? Also does that mean Denmark has lowered their standards to selling the name base on a good product history, then switching up on the consumer for cheaper quality at the same price....oh ...hell no!"
3,Great but with huge flaw,"I bought these for a walking shoe when out of town, and absolutely loved them...most comfortable shoe ever. Sooo... I only wore them on ""dress"" walking occasions, and they looked new when were about 1 year old. That is when the plug with logo on sole fell out. I went to 3 shoe repair shops with no solution. Since it is rubber, I also went to bike shop where they perform tire repair...just laughed at me. A premium shoe should not have a plug like this which ruins it. I am off Ecco because of that."
5,Well worth the money!,"These shoes, while costly up front, more than pay for themselves. They last for years and maintain a good look with very little signs of wear occuring until at least a year down the road. Even better... they are comfort focused. No rigid edges or stiff soles. Excellent for working and walking all day! They also are versatile... dressy enough for dress slacks (but not a suit) and casual enough for jeans."
2,poor workmanship,"I've owned Ecco shoes for years. I was always impressed by how well they were assembled and how long they lasted. This pair is different. The insole has come loose and the stitching is failing. I will think twice before considering this brand again. For the price I expect top quality, not cheapo stuff."
2,The shoe doesn't look like this...,"Not as advertised: The shoe looks very different than every photo on the site. The box and documentation indicate it's a ""Seawalker"", but it is a very different shoe style."
3,runs narrow,"I have purchased many pairs of ECCOs over the years mostly with good results. I am a woman with bad,wide feet and I stand all day long as a painter. In the past I have purchased the ECCO Men's ""Cross"" style as a work shoe and found it met my comfort requirements: soft breathable leather, including a smooth leather insole, great arch support and flexible sole. Since that style is no longer available I took a chance on the ""Seawalker"". Unfortunately, I have been trying to ""break-in"" this shoe for several weeks but still cannot wear them for more than an hour. The leather seems heavier and stiffer and the sole is not as flexible as the ""Cross"", the stitching is higher on the foot and it is DEFINITELY cut more NARROW. It is still a well made shoe and if you have narrow, less sensitive feet, it could be a good choice.I may have waited too long to return these but I am still looking for a comfortable, supportive work shoe that fits me....will sell the ""Seawalkers"" to anyone interested."
5,Great shoes,These are very comfortable shoes. i have a wide foot and usually cannot wear shoes comfortably unless they are in a wide width. These however fit fine. They are my second pair of these WCCO shoes and I like them a great deal.
1,Delivered WRONG size and USED,"I received these shoes today and I was ecstatic since shipping took awhile. When I opened it, the box said size 40, the correct size that I ordered. I took a shoe out, it was new and size 40 which is perfect. However, I took the other shoe out, it was size 45 and obviously USED. I am not going to wear one foot with the correct size and the other foot 5 sizes larger..."
5,Best I've ever owned,"I'm in my sixties, so have been around. I always buy $100.00+ shoes. These are my all time favorite. You can wear these for semi-dress or with shorts or dress slacks with a sport coat or tee shirt. They will become the most versatile shoes you own. perfect for travel in a carry on."
4,My kids love playing house with this iron!,"I bought this iron for my in-home childcare about 18 months ago. They use it with our Little Tikes laundry ironing board and have a lot of fun with it. The light is cute, although the kids always leave it on; the batteries have never needed to be replaced, despite daily use, so that says a lot! My kids range in age from 2 - 6 and they all enjoy it, especially the 2-year old. It is incredibly durable (my son finally realizes it's not a throwing toy) and looks exactly like a real iron. I used the water feature once and realized it was not a good idea as our son had the water everywhere. The kids don't even know it's missing and I'm sure it helps the toy last longer. The price was a little more than I wanted to pay, but--in the end--it was worth it. They really enjoy playing house, laundering and ironing clothes! For your boys and girls alike, it's a wonderful way to introduce them to the concepts of responsibility and the work that keeps a household going."
3,I guess kids don't like to iron either,"My daughter likes to pretend she vacuums when I vacuum. She likes to push her bubble mower when I do. So I figured she'd like this iron to go along with her be-like-daddy behaviors. Well, turns out it's pretty boring to pretend you are ironing.It's a well crafted toy, but I would question how much fun or educational value this would have for other children."
4,GREAT FOR KIDS OVER FIVE,"i BOUGHT TWO OF THESE IRONS AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE RED LED LIGHTS AND A SPRAYER ON THEM. LOOKS ALMOST LIKE THE REAL THING. MADE OF PLASTIC, BUT NOT THE MOST DURABLE."
4,Fresh,This cd is pretty good. I would recommend it for anyone that likes the old skool rap. It is a good one.
5,I love this book,The author has a great sense of humor and I love how it is broken down by rooms. I also like how she explained what room to clean at what time of the year.
4,"A Little Different, Still Good Stuff","Now when I first heard some of their new stuff of this album on purevolume, I was afraid that the band had completely changed their sound. Remember Right Now is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I'll admit that this CD is not as good as that comparatively. Either way, the band does transform their sound, but it's not a terrible change. The comparison to another Taking Back Sunday copycat doesn't do this CD justice. There are still remnants of their sound from Remember Right Now, like the driving bass line that you can usually hear. The vocals are a little different but it still has the general sound from the last album. Either way, I think it's an honest effort to change the band's sound a little, and it's an enjoyable listen. Most real fans of the band will appreciate the subtle changes, the fairweather fans will dismiss it and consider them another sell-out band."
1,What Happened??,"I'm sorry. Remember Right Now was a really good CD that caught my attention the first time I heard it. This CD has no emotion in it whatsoever, it sounds like they wrote this album because they needed to put something out and they just didn't have any time to develop any good songs. They should really take their own advice and stop doing bad things."
2,What Happened?,Yo this CD sucks compared to Remember Right Now... I still listen to that CD.. I was done with this garbage after 3 plays.. It lacks the hooks that Remember Right Now had... Remember Right Now is head and shoulders above this album.. you guys are just in denial.. trust me.. i didnt want this to be true.. hopefully they will throw this CD in the garbage and make another CD more like Remember Right Now.. Spitalfield can do better and we all know it.. Im just givin it a 2 out of 5 because I have too much respect for Spitalfield to slap a 1 star on em
1,Different isn't always good,"Spitalfield's first album is definitely a hit but as for ""stop doing bad thing"" well that's a whole different story it just isn't spitalfield it sounds like a pathetic attempt to go hardcore and it just doesn't work for spitalfield at all don't bother buying this album its garbage and I'm pissed i wasted money buying it stick with ""Remember Right Now"" and don't destroy any respect you have for spitalfield by even listening to their new album"
5,ha,"I usually don't write reviews but I was reading some of the ones for this cd, and omg... it was given like -no- credit at all... anyways, Remember Right Now was sooo good, and i was in love with it for the longest time. Spitalfield is so unique its not even right. So I buy their new cd, and it kicks the old ones ass. I'm sorry, but it does. I still rock out to Remember... but Spitalfield has really gotten so much better musically in this cd. I mean seriously, anybody who reviews this cd and says ""omg no it sucks! stick with remember right now!"" is very narrow-minded and shallow. Sure they changed styles a bit, but its for the better. So if you're thinking of buying this, then you should. I promise you won't regret if you have any type of good music taste at all."
2,Fun but...,"This is, as has been said before, a fun toy. However, the smell is strong! If you are like me and are reading this review now, having read a few reviews already, and thinking to yourself that ""those people must be exaggerating, or they have super sensitive noses"" think again. I made that mistake. It IS a fun toy, but the plastic strawberry scent is EXTREMELY stubborn. After having washed it with 3 separate soaps 5 times, the scent is still very prevalent. The only way it went away was when I dunked it in my bathroom sink. Only completely submerged in water does that plastic strawberry smell go away, and even that was only temporary, because as soon as it was pulled from the baptismal sink the smell came rushing back. Wish I had paid attention to the other reviewers about the scent. I would much prefer this toy with no scent whatsoever."
3,Not too bad,"This was the very first time I had purchased an adult/toy product. It was too big at first. The first time I tried, I had to stop because it hurt. The next time, I used a lot, I say a lot of lube...and you know the saying ""where there's a will, there's a way.""The smell gave me a little head ache. It's not that bad of a smell (almost like plastic strawberries) but I can still smell the scent in my room an hour or so after cleaning it and tucking it away.All in all, not a bad product and not too expensive. If you're curious, give it a try."
3,The toy,We wanted to try something new in the bedroom..but no one told us we would be punished after we had fun lolThe toy is very good feel great it did hurt at first because it is bigger then we expected but once you get used to it its not that bad but the smell is so strong even after we put it back in the package and put it in the closet our room still stinks i even doubled it in a ziplock bag and the smell is still in there if anyone knows how to get rid of the smell let me knowi give it a 3 out of 5 because its good at doing what it was made to do its smooth i dont know about you guys but i use a condom on it and it still feels great but the smell is just bad
3,NOT WHAT EXPECTED,I REALLY DO NOT UNDER-STAND WHY THIS HAS TO SMELL LIKE CHEMICAL BUT IT SMELLS REALLY BAD LIKE CHEMICALS EWWWWWW. WASNT LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT BUT BESIDES THAT IT ISNT THAT BAD OTHER WISE
3,Surprised,"Be prepared!!!!! This is quite large! I purchased a toy previously on Amazon and it was too small, so I was looking for something a bit larger.. This is huge! While I have enjoyed using it, I am not able to do so as much as I would like..."
5,***Just Right***,"My wife likes it a lot....Not to big and not to small !!! Just the right size!!!! The texture is great and it is rigid enough to do the job but still flexible enough to not be uncomfortable. It does have that synthetic smell, but its not horrible and it does seem to fade a bit after a few washings!"
5,Its GREAT!,"I really like this product. It has a strong rubber smell to it, but honestly it gets the job done. It was actually my first toy and I couldnt be happier with it. Delivery took a little long, but I was anxious for it so I didnt care. For the girls that dont really get wet easily I recommend some Lube. because the chubby 8.5 incher is a good size. I thought it would be bigger in thickness but its perfect! Deff recommend!"
2,its silly,"basically i was expecting hard plastic, my mistake i guess. also it smells like fruit and makes everything it touches smell the same. its floppy, and silly. too big (also my bad) haha this just makes me laugh."
1,Beware-nothing but a reprise of old recordings,"If you have other Spitfire Band CD's, you have the recordings on this CD. It is nothing but a collection of already existing Spitfire Band recordings. Amazon should be scolded for not including a list of songs or a review indicating the nature of the CD. I returned mine unopened with a harsh note."
4,Good Product,"Was Having a drainage issue with the sewer line and used this product as prescribed and everything seems to be back to good operating order,no problems as of yet and has been 45 days"
2,Didn't work,I used this as a preventative measure for our old pipes in a house we just bought. But alas this didn't not clear the pipes as just recently we had to have a plumber to unclog our pipes
1,$10 wasted,I first treated all my drains with lye. They were still slow so I figured must be the mainline Spent $10 on this CRAP and followed the directions. Used it at night did it the 4 days and AND NOTHING! MONEY WASTED! In fact I think the toilet is draining even slower now. Ridiculous the stuff had no smell or color and I could a swore it was just plain water. I think I been scammed!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,whats all the fuss,"sounds like a thousand outher garage funk bands out there ,lead singer very annoying ,bad mix on the recording not that impressed sorry"
5,Amazing cleanser.,"I picked these up in a local beauty supply not expecting much. I was totally wrong! Fruitland's yellow soil cleanser is the best cleanser I have used in recent memory. After washing my face the first time with it, my face glowed as if I had not washed it for days.I've used some of the other packs, too, and they are good, but the yellow soil is amazing."
5,nice ride,These springs give my Scion a great new feel on the road. Cornering speed has doubled without any problems. I'm also able to go over speed bumps without bottoming out. My advice for weekend mechanics like me. Get a good set of strut spring clamps. Air compresser would be good as well. Total R&R time for front was 3 hrs. Also you may need to buy a camber kit for the rear to even things out durring alignment. Without it you may have accessive inner tread wear. Front alingnmnet good to go.
1,This game sucks!!,"This game sucks I cant believe I wasted my $20.00 on this game.You know the saying you shouldnt judge a book by its cover, well the saying is pointing at this game. I mean come on the cover makes the game look very awesome but its not. The cars are ugly and so is the city. I only get 1 game a year until Christmas comes and I wasted my 1 game on this STUPID GAME DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!"
2,Blahh,"After playing GT3 I was looking for another PS2 racer. I saw that MCSR was a highly rated racer so I opted to get it. Even at the reduced price of [money]I felt slightly ...A Racer? Hardly, a good amount of time is ""cruising"" the streets for a race or performing other mundane tasks. When you get to race you have to race against a few cars, the trick is to learn all the shortcuts such as which street to turn down first etc.. The car selection is ..., you have a cab, low riders, a couple other boring cars and it really leaves you wondering why this game was so popular. The cars cannot be upgraded as far as I can tell. The game play is responsive but not realistic.If you enjoy the driving action in GTA3 you will like this game if you're a driving enthusiast and like the realism of Grand Turismo stay away from this game. My kids who don't like GT3 prefer playing it over MCSR. I will rent the next version of the game before purchasing it.Ed"
1,Horrible game,"This game disapointed me quite a lot. It has bad graphics, but the worst part is the control nothign like any other racing game except maybe pole position for Atari. Bad physics int he sense of hitting others and aceloration and everything. With the bad control I find it quite hard to get anywhere int he game as well as the sight of the game screen just mkes me want to shut it off. Sorry I don't mean to be so rude to the game but I really am disapointed and would not recommend it if you like racing games at all."
2,Too hard to win,"Graphics are okay. Gameplay is fine. However, you practically have to be a professional NASCAR driver to win once you start moving up in the levels. I don't feel like re-racing for one hour or more just to win one race! And why do you have to chase the person you want to initially race for 5 to 10 minutes or more just to race them once you catch them?Bottom line: Rent it, don't buy it."
2,Whats Missing here?!,"Checked out the box before I bought the game.Loved the idea of the game and the games graphics looked awesome (look at the picture with the highly detailed road,yellow car, and skidmarks). Now when I got home and put the game in I thought, where is the game pictured on the box. The backgrounds are horrible, the cars are horrible, and I have yet to see one skidmark on the road...and dont even mention the crappy looking water. I could have sworn this was a PSone game. Is the game fun..yah for about 2 min. This game had potential to be awesome and in my opinion it flopped. Just my 2 cents."
3,"Play control great, but nothing special.","Its really easy to control the vehicle, and the cars look neat, but the game really doesn't stand out as a racing game. Although I only played this game as a four day rental, I have the following issues with it:1) Looks like the used the engine from Midtown Madness with different cars and the ability to hit people.2) No guts when you hit people, litter, sparks, needs more realism?3) Acceleration a bit too slow. It gets better as you get better vehicles, but it can be annoying in the beginning.4) Needs more jumps and cool stuff. Midtown madness had drawbridges and stuff that made great jumps. Maybe use Car Carriers or something.I suggest holding out for Grand Turismo and seeing what people say about it."
2,Unimpresive,"If you are looking for a good racing game, look somewhere else. This game has great graphics, but the cars control like shopping carts. If you are looking for a game that is essentially the same thing but GOOD, go buy Midtown Madness 2. Otherwise all you racing fans better wait for Gran Turismo 2000"
1,"If you are getting the Midnight Club game, read this first!","Somehow I thought that this game was cool, but I believe I was mistaken. This game looked like you could crash inside the stores and the cops in your tail. But no, this game has rules such as racing fast and the cops chasing you for no freaken reasing, doesn't that ... Come on ROCKSTAR GAMES, make games that are cool not dumb like this one. I want my money back because I wasted ... plus tax for nothing. Please rent the game first ok people, before buying it because then you are going to feel the same way I feel."
3,"Great graphics, mediocre playing","Whoa! Another greatest hits[]deal! Don't pull that money out of your pocket just yet; read this review! (just kidding)This game is another racing game. How many racing games have there been for PS2? 500? Who knows. But somehow, this game was a bestseller, and is for 3 platforms. What makes this game latch on to people like only a few other games do?Well, you can take a joyride, and runover people and find secret cars, or race gang members like Emilio and win their cars. This sounds fun! But, if you're like me, and you've played many racing games for many platforms, this will become boring.Especially, there is no single mode where just you and another player can race each other. The two courses, London and New York, are not made for that. That is a big problem.[]"
3,Same cars,The gameplay is okay. The sequence is kind of stupid. The makers could'nt even come up with more than 10 cars. The graphics are good though.
3,"It's fun, but too easy...","When I first saw this game, I really wanted to get it. When I finally got it, I thought it was very fun. Atleast until I had played it for a few days. That's when it started getting boring. It was way too easy. I mean, you know, I would always beat the guy I'm racing against. And getting the secret cars was a sinch. I think anyone who likes to get through games VERY quickly should buy this. You'll get through this pretty fast, unless you haven't played racing games before."
2,"Buy it used, better yet don't buy it at all",The game play wasn't very captivating and became mundane and repetitive after only a few games. I was willing to sell this thing... less than three weeks after I bought it.... Don't pay attention to the hype. This game isn't all that it is cracked up to be.
1,"Umm, I don't know what some of the reviewers are smoking but","This game really just ...The graphics are terrible for a PS2 game. Oh, ok, up close the street looks pretty decent. The buildings look like lovely blocks up until you get close enough to ram them. More than once I've found myself driving over nebulous gray something that may have been concrete. It's a sad waste of what the PS2 is capable of. Oh, but the wet streets right under your car look ok, as the building textures suddenly pop into view as you zoom past.It's somewhat ok as a multiplayer game, but even then it's only so so. These guys tried to make a game to compete with carmageddon in the original midtown madness. That was mediocre too. It's pretty obvious they're trying too hard to make something for the masses that is a toned down version of just that -- carmageddon.Save yourself the cash, don't buy this one. It's pathetic."
2,What a waste of money,"It's a stinker. I normally write verbose reviews with pros and cons and try to be objective but I took this game out of my console within 10 minutes because it was so bad (or rather it really didn't show me why I should pay for this title on PS2 rather than buying Midtown Madness 2.0 for PC - written by the same developers).Didn't really push the PS2's features, car control and physics were poor, graphics were fine but nothing spectacular...not like some of the other launch titles, and choice of cars was limited and cartoony.Save your money and wait for GT3."
2,Here is an idea!,"I have a great idea for an awesome driving game!A driving simulation that you just drive in traffic day and day out. All you do is obey the speeding limits, use your turn signal and pass legally. Rear end someone, break speeding limit, and do something stupid. The cops are after you like a hawk!After seeing all those police chase videos, you realize that you cannot evade the cops no matter what. So what the heck you put the pedal to the metal and later get caught and etc...To final stage is to wait through a traffic jam in the middle of rush hour in New York City and then find a parking space next to your run down apartment!"
2,Awful!,"When I first got my PS2 ( during its early weks of release ) i got this game with it. The second I started playing it, i wasn't taken away by the graphics much, or the gameplay. I find the story hard, and boring, as well as the rest of the game. Very boring, and very stupid game right here. I still have it but it also has a few layers of dust on it. Skip this one."
3,"Midnight Club is Good, but it Freezes","The game is great, just read the other reviews, but I have to mention one problem with it. If you plan on playing the game for over an hour and a half, don't get it. It freezes after you play for that long. Otherwise, it's a really good pick."
4,a very deep and addictive racing game,"as soon as you pick up the controller, you will not put it down for quite some time.sure, they're are only two cities to race in,but they're HUGE!as you traverse the cities,this game just keeps you coming back for more.as far as the grahics go, it's quite obvious that you're playing on a next generation system. a little bland in spots,but for the most part they're excellent. this is no gran turismo, but then what racing game comes close to that anyway? highly reccommended."
1,a truly terrible game,"you know those missions in GTA3 where you have to race to grab the most checkpoints? thats all there is to this game. Only you can't get out of the cars to blow stuff up. There is absolutely no reason to purchase this game, especially if you own GTA3.I got it for free and it was overpriced."
1,Worst Midnight Club Game Ever Made,"Good:NONEBad:Poor GraphicsNo Customization of the cars that you can dono ponding of rain on the roads like on versions 2 and 3:DUBPoor weather condition graphics, good in Midnight Club 2 and 3If you plan on buying this game, it really sucks, so do not buy it, even if you like it. I rather you purchase DUB EDITION: 3rd MC game.My overall ratings of the game are:Fun=100% (for a month in 2004)Fun Rating Now: 0% (for the remainder of 2004 and some of 2005)The last time I played this game was over 9 months ago, it got so boring because of graphics and the poorly made cars.LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GAME: It really sucks, so do not buy it."
1,Zero stars if it was possible!!!,"What are all these positive reviewers smoking? I rented this game, and was severely disappointed to say the least. The box made this game look like a playable ""Fast and the Furious"" type game. Boy, was I disappointed. I rented it, and brought it back the next day. My friend is big into racing games, and he said ""I need to buy this"" after watching the opening cinema. However, the gameplay is [terrible], as we both soon found out. Seeing that this was made by Rockstar, we expected something in the area of Grand Theft Auto 3, but with more emphasis on racing. What we got was Playstation One graphics, no cars to start off with except for a stupid taxi and truck, and no incentive to unlock the other cars. I felt like I was playing Sega 32X!!!!!!!! Avoid this game like the plague, rent or buy Grand Turismo 3 instead!!!!!!!!! Please, it's for your own good."
2,Sadly Disappointing...,"I got this game through Hype and the previews of magazines, and I must Say What a Disappointment!! The gameplay is horrible compared to what the ps2 and decent games are capable of. The graphics are ok but the cars just ...... I would not recommend this title to anyone. I have played this game for an hour and must say got bored with it almost instantly. Even with the Gameshark codes with all the cars unlocked it was horrible. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The reason I even gave the game a 2 was the graphics alone, and even those could be a lot better."
2,Midnight Clubmeinthehead,"When I first bought this game, i thought that it would be much like The Fast and the Furious. It was satisfying after a while, but the game gets so BORING! It's extremely messed up and this is my opinion and I feel it is one of the worst games i have ever played! I sincerely hope that Midnight Club 2 is better, because it sure sounds better!"
3,Midnight Club: Street Racing,I bought this video game for my sepson's boy. So I'm just saying what I noticed in him.
2,"Good thought for the game, but the product not the greatest","After reading several reviews on Amazon.com and couple of other web sites, and then finally maing the purchase, and actually playing the game, I'm somewhat disappointed in its design, gameplay and the story. I've expacted a little more. Truely graphics need to be improved, they don't look like PS1, but need major improvement. Gameplay is simply okay, but the story and the plot of the game could be done with more sense. I personally hate the idea of chasing some guy around NYC for couple of longer minutes, before he finally stops and tells you, that you can race him. The game itself is somewhat confusing as it lacks good instructions and what the objectives are.If I were to rate this game by gameplay, design, etc. here is what you can expect (on a sacle from 1 - 10):Gameplay - 6Graphics - 7Sound - 7Fun to play - 5Value - 8 ..."
4,Almost a Substitute for Driver...,"I loved Driver and Driver 2 on PS. My favorite way to spend a couple hours gaming was to go for a ride around the featured cities, just exploring. Midnight Club almost brought that experience home to the PS2 for me. Unfortunately, though the graphics are much better than the latter titles, the cities (only two, New York and London) in Midnight Club are too small and don't have the same atmosphere as those in the Driver games. Regardless, some of the visuals in MC are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, like the rain/wet tarmac effects. wow. Another great thing about MC is that in some small way, it satisfied my hunger for Gran Turismo 3. MC is one of the best first generation PS2 titles."
3,It's fun then blah...,"this game is very fun in the beginning when you are trying to get better cars and beat faster people... it kept me entertained for a few hours but when i learned the map, the techniques of the computer driver, and the shortcuts, the game became very repetative... it was just blah... i would recommend NFS over this game..."
3,Not bad,"This game is fun for a couple of hours but then becomes kind of repetitive, especially who PC gamers who have played Midtown Madness and Midtown Madness 2 (developed by the same guys). The graphics is decent, although it does not appear to be as sharp as on a PC with a good 3D graphics card (maybe it's the nature of TV images). I wouldn't say it's worth the money if you have played MM2, but makes a good rental title."
4,Mid-night club with cheats,"I got this game a few months ago, it's not bad, just confusing when doing a race because you can go both ways eg left or right and still end up at the end.you race a guy once to enter the club and get his phone number (if u beat him in a race) next time u race him and come first, u win his car, race him again u get his other car. after that u have to find another guy to race and get their cars, then u go to london........also theirs capture the flag. u have to pick up the flag at a flashing location, shown in yellow on ur map, and deliver it, a flashing green light on ur map, before the other racers.... . ....Overall not a bad game but can be boring after a while (couple of hours)"
5,this is one of the best games i have ever played,This game is definitly worth buying. The graphics are outstanding. The cars are really cool! Drive around in a tricked out sports car through the city of New York or even London! When you catch up to one of the racers in cruise mode you have to follow him until he finally stops. He will then challenge you to a race. If you beat him you are then part of the Midnight Club!If you like Illegal street racing this is definitly the game for you! Even if your not crazy about racing if you like anything that has to do with cars this is the game for you. This game is definitly NOT A RENTAL!!This is a must buy game! This game is better than Gran Turismo 3 and better than Grand Theft Auto 3! This game shows that you do not need violence in a game to make it a good game!
1,Dull,This one got dull pretty fast. 2 cities and 4 cars to choose from. This one appeared to be rushed in order to make the launch of PS2. Another good rental.
4,a very deep and addictive racing game,"As soon as you pick up the controller, you will not put it down for quite some time.Sure, they're are only two cities to race in,but they're HUGE!As you traverse the cities,this game just keeps you coming back for more.As far as the grahics go, it's quite obvious that you're playing on a next generation system. A little bland in spots,but for the most part they're excellent. This is no Gran Turismo, but then what racing game comes close to that anyway? Highly reccommended."
1,"Nice, but boring...","Of the 3 PS2 games I own and the 10+ I have rented so far (this was a rental), Midnight Club is definately the worst.One word summary: BORING.Unless you are a 16 year old kid who dumps all of his money into suping up a lowered Honda Civic (trying to create the fastest street car in his high school), you will probably not appreciate this game.The game: Race other computer drivers to try and move up in the game...win pink slips...get better cars (you start with a taxi cab!?)...blah, blah, blah. Wow, what an exciting concept (yeah right). The game earns its one star because the graphics are good - as they should be, this is PS2.My recommendation: Save your money for some of the other titles that are coming out soon, many of which look to be pretty cool. (Unless again you are 16, grounded from you lowered Honda, and just NEED your fix of racing that neighborhood punk.)"
4,Nice Job !,"I like this game for the simple fact that its concept is different than most others.The game play is pretty smooth and the graphics are sharp with detail in most areas..The control is not bad it goes pretty good with the smooth game play (not choppy).The only reason I did not give it a 5th star is, I feel the game is missing something ? REFINEMENT & REALISM...If You play this, run over a pedestrian a few times in a row, they should be dead by then. Nope they get up and come back for more..And I say refinement because It would be nice if the cars laid rubber on the pavment when you peel out. :PThis does not take the fun out of the game.Also, The Dance Disco Beats are Great, to bad I cant Burn the soundtrack on CD-R !!Over all in My opinion it is 97% game that could have been 100%..Nice Job !!"
2,yawn,"I rented this game after reading some good reviews here, but personally I thought Midnight Club was pretty lame. The lighting effects and cars are pretty cool looking, but otherwise the graphics were just average. The audio is really bad. The characters that you race against have about three different taunts that they say and it gets annoying in a hurry. On the positive side, the controls are decent and the cars handle well. It's a nice concept for a game, but I just didn't think Midnight Club Racing was that much fun. I'm certainly glad I rented it first instead of wasting fifty bucks."
4,Midnight Express,"Very fun game with very simplistic gameplay. This is the Grand Turismo made more for kids or someone who does not want extremely hard gameplay. Multiple races with multiple vehicles once you win the first couple of races which, once again, are very easy. I recommend this to anyone who does not want to have to push several buttons at once just to do one thing."
2,missing lessons,"book arrived in a timely manner, although the first 18 pages were missing. I don't remember if the listing told that there were missing pages. That means that the 1st 9 lessons are gone, so it makes teaching a bit difficult as I have no idea what the initial pages had for content."
5,Delicious L'elisir Recording,"This is my favorite L'elisir recording out of many. Carreras perfectly captures the romantic ardour of the not- so- sharp Nemorino, one of the most likeable characters in all opera. His voice has a nice ring to it and he genuinely seems to be having a good time with the character. He plays off Nucci very well - they're really hilarious. Nucci is also in great voice here - a perfect casting choice.Ricciarelli proves to be a rather viperish Adina, with an edgy quality to the singing. at least before she falls for Nemorino towards the end of the opera. She is also quite humorous in her interactions with Nemorino. When she finally melts to his charms at the end, her voice takes on a much sweeter sound - it's very touching. This is also a very ITALIAN sounding interpretation on all acounts... Scimone conducts with lots of style, never letting things drag out. The digital sound is about perfect. One of my favorite Donizetti recordings."
2,Unreliable,"I am a pro photog and purchased two cards about a year ago and have been having constant problems with corrupt files and my computers not recognizing the card (more than one computer, more than one reader... after months of trying to determine whether it was the camera, the readers, the computer, the software, I came to the realization that it was indeed these cards. I continued to use them as sometimes they would work but I'm finally tossing them because one day I will lose something I will forever regret (and memory is so much cheaper now. SanDisk has worked well for me.... I did not get a Kingston reader so maybe that would help."
1,Sure to break down,"I bought mine 2 months ago, and for no reason at all, while i was taking some vids through my camera, it stopped functioning. I was unable to read the device and now its waiting to end up in the bin. The travelite works fine so far."
3,Kingston TravelLite-AWESOME (for a while),"The 2GB card worked extremely well. In 3 weeks in China I filled the card with 1298 images at the highest resolution (most pics a meg or more). They downloaded perfectly to my computer. Because of previous negative reviews on Amazon I took the precaution of not using the reader until the images were downloaded and backed up. The reader was awesome at first! The thumbnails came up instantly and it was a great and easy way to preview and delete pics. But after previewing about 600 images the instant previews stopped. I'm not an expert and don't know why it worked great for about half the images and then had trouble--maybe a memory issue? I also took the precaution of being sure to ""safely eject"" USB devices, both the camera cable and the reader. No problem with images being erased which can sometimes happen with any USB device if it is not ""safely"" ejected. Would like to know from Kingston if the reader stopped working so perfectly because of memory issues."
1,bad quality of the card sd Kingston,I am a client called to account in Venezuela which day 17 of March of the 2007 buys this card since in my work he is very useful to handle data information and sd of 2gb interested a card to me but I do not recommend this card it soon last (life utility) for my necessities of 2 weeks damage to me
4,Useful and compact,"This is good New Testament for taking along on door-knocking. It fits comfortably in a pants pocket and has decent-sized type for such a small volume. I'm not sure how useful all the ""metadata"" is (it includes lists of verses on various topics and directs you to the next verse in the list from each verse). Overall, well worth the price."
2,Disappointment,"The picture posted did not properly represent the actual adding machine. The nachine is very old, and barely prints on the paper roll. Lesson learned this time. I got such good deals on the website that I got used to positive input. This is my first negative feedback to you, Amazon.com."
4,Portlandia season 2 - Uneven but funny enough,"I enjoyed Portlandia season two, especially the first 4 episodes, and the then last 3. There was a lull in the middle episodes where some of the material was just not that funny. The bar was set pretty high with the six episodes of season one. Looking foward to season 3."
3,"Funny, but not as good as season 1","I thought this season was thoughtful and there are definitely some really great moments, but the excitement and originality of season 1 isn't really really there. I can't wait to see season 3 though and I really appreciate this series. It's great as a whole."
5,It is so fun to watch Portlandia!,"You know that feeling? The feeling that you've seen/heard/watched it all before? Well, get ready to lose that hurtful feeling when you delve into the fun that is Portlandia. Portlandia is a roll of the dice (in the best way possible). They will take you into realms of comedy you have heretofore not experienced. In my line of enjoyment, that is all that matters. Thanks, gang!"
3,"Great show, lousy packaging for Season 2","Wonderful quirky show.But why did they cheap out for season #2, and package the DVDs in a flimsy cardboard box with cardboard envelopes that leave surface scratches all over the discs. How much did they save by not using real DVD covers?? Come on!!"
4,Still Smilin',"Just finished it, and I'm still smiling. 'Brunch Village' in Portland- yeah, I've been there. It nails the Portland institution (with it's often painfully long wait-times) of brunch, and adds a spin that only Portlandia could . . ."
4,Pure Armisen!,"Addictingly off-the-wall humor! (Funny no matter where you live, but even more so if you live (of have lived) in Portland. It's so-o-o painfully true!!) If you don't live in Portland, go ahead . . . laugh at us. If you do live in Portland, laugh with us!"
4,"The show's good, but I wish Washed Out would release Life of Leisure on CD again","Again, they did a great job of making North Brooklyn look like Portland, OR. Really great show, they just need to change the name to something more relevant\catchier."
2,not what I was looking for,"All I wanted was a book to help me prepare for breastfeeding, not a book that made me feel that if I didnt breastfeed my baby would be at a huge disadvantage. I felt like it was judgemental and non forgiving to anyone who either can not or chooses not to breastfeed. I am a future mother who wants to try to breastfeed but I refuse to beat myself up if I am unable. This was not the book for me. I was really dissapointed because it had such great reviews"
3,Helpful find,I started reading this book during my pregnancy and found it full of useful information. Not only do I recommend the seller but I recommend the book as well.
2,Not very helpful,"While it is titled ""the definitive breastfeeding edition"" it is more just filled with anecdotes the author and her friends experienced during their own breastfeeding adventures rather then giving advice and suggestions for going about breastfeeding. Entertaining at first but more annoying towards the end. I wouldn't recommend actually purchasing this book unless you are strictly doing it for an entertainment value rather than educational/informational value."
5,delightfully to the point,"I thought i knew a little something about breastfeeding, and i wanted to do it, you know, if i was able ... I loved reading this book and finding out why my first statement is a mistake and learning a lot about the different types of breastfeeding and all the advantages of breastfeeding."
3,"Some good info, but too preachy","I was torn on how many stars to give this book.I love some of the information in this book; but to get to it you have to get past all of the author's one-sided views regarding breastfeeding. Even as someone who plans to breastfeed, I was completely turned off by her need to constantly tell me why (1) breastfeeding is the only way, (2)formula is evil and (3) it's breastfeeding mothers against the world. I was also a little suspicious of some of the ""facts"" and ""studies"" she gave about breast milk over formula because she didn't provide any references or sources for what she said.This book definitely should not be read or given to anyone who is on the fence or who may have trouble with breastfeeding."
1,Terrible!!!,"I received this book free in a breastfeeding class I took at a local hospital. I thought this book was absolutely terrible. It bashed hospitals, nurses, and anyone else not 100% involved and supportive of breastfeeding. I myself am planning on breastfeeding, as I am due in one week, and wanted to read up on the subject. I just thought the writer was overly negative about everything. It was a shame I wasted my time reading the book. I threw it right in the garbage after I was done. I am not even sure way I finished it. I was just hoping chapter after chapter it would get better. What a disappointment!"
4,Good Book..A bit lectury,"I liked this book as it is very informative and to the point. I did, however, find it to be a bit lecture-y. It's great if you need to convince yourself or someone else about the benefits of breastfeeding."
2,Good information but too onesided for me,"The information was good but it was buried within the author's own prejudices. I was very disappointed as I was really looking forward to this book. My recommendation would be to spot read this book and use it for reference only. Reading it cover to cover will make you frustrated, just give me the information and not your own ""formula makers are evil"" speech."
5,Easy to Read,"When my friend handed this book down to me I thought ""A whole book on breastfeeding? How much can there possibly be to learn? And how will I ever make it through the whole book?""Well, there is a lot to learn but this book made it enjoyable. It is an easy read and offers great advice on breastfeeding and dealing with a newborn in general. I breezed through this book and before I knew it I had a wealth of knowledge in the breastfeeding department. My stance on breastfeeding before I read this book was ""Well, I'll try it, but if I'm not able to do it I won't be devastated."" Now I know that most women ""can"" breastfeed if they want and only about 5% of the population have serious enough problems that they actually cannot physically continue breastfeeding. It has made my decision a much more definite one which I believe you will need in order to get through those first few weeks of breastfeeding.Don't be scared of this book! It's great and you will get through it in a breeze."
5,Great for all new moms!,This book was refered to me by a great friend. I love reading it! It's wonderfuly funny and informative! It helped me feel alot for comfortable about nursing my 4th child! I then bought several copies and gave them to each friend and neighbor that was expecting. I've heard nothing but raves from each person. I'm expecting our 5th child And have more friends expecting their first. I am going to purchase more coppies to give away. This is a great book EVERY mother/woman should read to KNOW how their bodies work! I recomend this book very highley to everyone!
1,I Threw it Across the Room,"I bought this on the recommendation of several people before my daughter was born, but she was only a few weeks old when I literally threw it across the room. For one thing, I found it VERY light on actual concrete information/mechanics, and almost all breastfeeding problems were attributed to ""not breastfeeding enough."" Second, I thought the author's attempts at humor were lame and not funny at all. Finally, the author presents a view of the ""breastfeeding lifestyle"" that isn't necessarily accurate. I wish I'd known it was possible to breastfeed without going whole-hog attachment parenting - we're just not a co-sleeping, 24/7 babywearing, extended-breastfeeding family - because seeing that presented here as THE way to breastfeed made the whole thing sound so unattractive that it made me want to give up completely. Don't waste your money."
4,A Bigger Font Would Be Helpful,It's so nice having so many translations of the Bible in one place. I really like the Bible. My only complaint is that I wish the Font were bigger.
4,Good Study Tool!,"This bible provides an excellent way to ""study"" the New Testament through different translations. It contains the regular King James version which can be used as a baseline for Christians who are opposed or reluctant to look at any other translations. The other translations give excellent interpretations of New Testament scriptures in line with the original text. This makes bible reading easier to understand and relevant to living today."
3,"Great Binoculars, Novelty Camera","The binoculars are excellent. The camera however is a novelty. Do not expect a high-resolution close-up shot of what you are looking at. It will give you an ok 4x6 picture. It is a .3 mega pixel camera, and that is exactly what you get. The magnification of the picture looks as if you stepped forward about 5 yards and took a regular picture. I like the rubber eyecups. They make it more comfortable for extended viewing. The software is easy to download and use. I highly recommend using a tri-pod though for the best pictures. I am pleased with the binoculars and the camera is fun to use. Do not expect more though. If you want more resolution buy a set with more mega pixels. All in all I am pleased with it, and it is worth the $54.00 I paid for it."
4,Great for music lover,"This is light jazz CD album, melodious, beautiful improvisation.Great Pianist, if you like Art Tatum or Hank Jones, you will likethis Japanese Pianist too.Musical performance & recording quality is good ( 3-4 stars ),if you like this album, you must get ""Autumn In Seattle""( XRCD2 / FIM ), it's latest album from T.Yamamoto ( I rated this CD for 5 stars )."
3,"Suprisingly fragile for the bulk, but nice looking...","The toy looks good and feels really solid, but one of the arms snapped off at the joint as soon as I started to pose it. I'm guessing it's a defect in the clear plastic used to make the joint. Soon after, part of the clip on his shield broke as well; the shield fits in a very specific way on the arm and the clip will bend/stretch if you attach it too far up. The figure looks really nice, and the clear plastic skeleton does give the illusion of floating pieces fairly well, but be careful it you plan on posing him dynamically, or in any way other than standing straight up."
1,Not valid,"Is he making his students buy this dribble? The poor guy is constantly billing himself as a International Relations expert, a History Expert, a Terrorism Expert, anything he can do to get his face on TV as an ""expert"" commentator. He is now writing on African-Americans, yet is from overseas, and now professes to tell us about our history?"
2,"detailer's choice 6375 chenille wash mop with 45"" telescopic handle","I liked the product,but they were defective.....did not telescope I had to use WD40 on them and one of them started working properly the other one I took it apart and finally got it to work ? would have returned if it wasn't for returned shipping cost.vendor should have inspected before sending. now they are what i expected !!"
2,Wand broke as soon as I got it.,I was really needing something to help clean the roof of my car. When I opened this up the wand would not extend and after twisting and pulling the end of it broke where the mop head screws in. I have compatable handles that I can use but this was really frustrating.
5,Awesome mop,"I know that this is meant to be used on cars, but I have found it to be the perfect kitchen mop.It swivels around the corners easily, and when I am finished I remove the chenille head and put it in the washing machine. I like it so much that I have bought another one to use at work."
5,Just as good as always,"The World Press Photo annuals are always a good showcase for the best photojournalism from the rest of the world (and an excellent companion to the NPPA's Best of Photojournalism series), and this year is no exception. There's plenty of spectacular documentary work in here that for whatever reason, just never seems to be published in the America, outside of these volumes: illegal immigration in South Africa; acid attacks in Bangladesh; the roadkill problem in Australia, etc.What's also nice is that although there apparently wasn't enough space to print the multi-image winners in their entirety, the back of the book has thumbnails of all winning entries, so you can still see the story in its entire presentation.The World Press Photo series is much more than just a simple chronicle of the winners, or a summary of the year in pictures...it's a window into some of the best work being done anywhere today."
5,Marketing and Finances for the Artist!,"It's always been too easy for me to focus on producing my art and let the financial and marketing side slide. This book made me aware of new ways to promote and market my work and helped me make plans to do so. Some of the questions in this book caused me to face ""tough"" realities about making and selling art, like the question about ""if I sell everything I make at the prices I'm currently charging, will I make money?"" But the book also showed me how small changes in price can make big changes in profit. I found it helpful that the book isolated the issues of promoting and selling my work just for the satisfaction of seeing it out there in the world. And then I could also focus on the promotion and sales sections, the parts which deal with expenses, variable costs,fixed costs, and profit."
