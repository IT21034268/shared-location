5,"Aesop would be proud, multi-level morals and fun","Kevin Henkes spins a wonderful tale that appeals to many age groups with the fun story of Lilly and her new purse. Lilly loves her teacher and school, but her normally attentive nature is put to the test when she brings her new purse and accessories to class one day. Woven with lessons about the importance of patience, listening, and responsibility, the story is accompanied by colorful and simple illustrations depicting the young mouse Lilly and other characters in ordinary classroom situations every child can relate to. Your children will love reading this with you; you'll have to read every delightful caption. Something in the story will make adults laugh every time they read it too. Very well rounded and enjoyable work."
4,Excellent Book,"This book is perfect for my 6 year old niece. It's the cute story of Lilly, who is so excited to impress her favorite teacher that she fails to give him respect and is punished instead of wowing him with her new things. She's mad at first but learns that he is trying to help her and not hurt her in doing so. I highly recommend this book."
5,Excellent read aloud!,"This is an excellent read aloud. My class really enjoyed Lily's antics and can relate to her overwhelming desire to show off special things. This is also a great author to use as a mentor in the classroom - we learn how to use emotion and humor, to show rather than tell, and to organize thoughts and ideas in our writing. A+!"
2,Lilly`s Purple Plastic Purse,Mae WhiteI read the book Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse. The reason I would recommend this book is so people could decide if they like it even though I didn't. I didn't like this book because Lilly was mean. In the book I read that Lilly was writing mean stuff to her teacher just because the teacher took her stuff away when she wasn't supposed to have it in school. This convinced me that it was not a good book.
1,Tedious!,"This story, is so tedious I couldn't keep my kid focused for more than a few moments at a time. The story took so long to get to the point, when you got there you could care less!Unfortunately it was required reading so we were forced to take the long winding road."
1,I hate it!,"i would give this book no stars if I could. It shows the ambivalence of our culture's attitude toward limit setting with children, as well as our inability to deal with anger. I would not let a child of mine near this book, no matter how entertaining it is. Having the teacher give Lilly presents after setting a reasonable limit undermines the idea that adults NEED to set reasonable limits and need not apologize for them; it gives the message that adults should try to get children to like them at all costs. Having Lilly feel deep shame for expressing her anger in a perfectly appropriate non-violent way delegitamizes her angry feeling and her way of expressing them. I am appalled but not surprised by the book's popularity; I would hope adults would start to think about the message this book gives to both aults and children."
5,Best pans ever!,"I have owned a set of these pans for many years! I love them! I add a new design here and there. They are well constructed, cook evenly, clean easily, look beautiful and last forever! I am very proud of my circulons and will stay loyal forever! This particular pan is my favorite! I use it for everything!"
4,"3/8"" iron","Was exactly what I wanted, unfortunately I recieved a defective one. There was no problem returning it, and it was easilyreplaced"
3,not as hot as i'd like,This curling iron doesn't get hot enough..I noticed even with extensions it still doesn'tProduce a lot of heat. The handle is a little loose and hard to keep in my hand. I am beautician who isvery familiar with Marcel irons.
4,"Hot Tools 3/8 "" Micro Mini Marcel Iron","I love the size of the barrel and the heat that it delivers, but it burns out quickly. I am a hairstylist and it lasted a week from the time I opened the box it was in, used it for the first time, and until a week later when it would not heat up. It might last longer for some one who uses it once daily. I style short hair and have it on all day. My larger size barrel irons have not burned out and I've been using them over a year. I wonder if there is a problem in the electrical plumbing of the iron. I want to get another one, but I can't keep buying this iron every other week. I hope this help with your decision."
4,so cute year after year,I purchase these for my mom for her to give as christmas gifts to her friends. I myself don't care for the stand (it's plastic and I've never been able to totally figure out how to make it stand up since the stand is really not long enough) and I wish they would do individual pictures on the weekends instead of putting Saturday and Sunday on one day. Some years they're a little pricey on Amazon so we've been forced to shop around the internet to get the best buy when you figure in shipping for 10-12 of these calendars. In the end they deserve the 4 stars. They have always arrived promptly and in great condition. And who can resist these furry critters...they give you a daily smile!
4,A pleasure to eat!,"This chocolate is not super sweet, but somewhere between semi-sweet and dark chocolate. You can really taste the cocoa. Rich and delightful."
3,great for beginners,"i only gave this three stars because it wasnt anything really new. it gives some good positions to try, but most of them are commonly known. they just gave them cool names to make them seem better i guess. now if you are new to this area of sex, then it is a good book with step by step guidance and pictures (though not very good ones!) my husband and i are still going to try the ""low down on going down"" book, but my hopes are not as high as they were when i ordered this one."
5,To all who suffer from TMJ,"This book came recomended to me from someone who has TMJ. She read the review from the Flutist and It has really helped me. If you stick with the exercises they will give you some relief and yes it has helped me with pleasing my husband. I was never able to last very long because of my TMJ and now we are both getting what we want. ha ha! So if your like me and are afraid to buy a book like this, it is tastefully done and whatever your reason it will be worth it, but you have to put the time into the exercises."
4,Useful exercises,Great book with a friendly style. Useful exercises for gaining strength with mouth and tongue techniques. One big tongue up!
3,Welll...,A bit long winded in parts...definitely some useful tips if you suck (pun intended) at this sort of thing. For those who are more learned there are some exercise to keep you limber?
4,Interesting overall -,Great ideas and exercises for the tongue. Wish it had more pictures of the exercises or visual diagrams of the other descriptions but I think that just depends on the person. Otherwise interesting & informative
5,Just the right amount of information Concisely told,Informative & Concisely told. The exercises are short enough & detailed enough to really learn something.
4,Not bad for the novice who wants to learn more,I bought this hoping to learn a few new thing to try out but pretty much all of the techniques I already knew. It did have some excellent exercises worth doing. It was well written and for those of you that are novices at this and want to drive your man wild in bed I recommend getting this book.
4,You Must Be Interested,"If you truly want to be a better fellatrix then buy this book. It will require you to do some work, more precisely, some oral exercises. Being an RN I was able to do the exercises w/o much question, but I think more diagrams are needed for those who do not know anatomy well. I must admit, I learned some very interesting things besides how to give good oral sex. I never knew my tongue had a specific resting place in my mouth or that it was slightly out of shape! I am doing most of the exercises, & there are a lot. Therein lies the problem....not enough time. But, like I said, if you like the power associated with being the best he's ever had, or love giving your partner this totally unselfish pleasure, then buy it. I guarantee you will learn more than just oral sex techniques."
2,Not for the monogamous,"Full of information, true. I feel like she spends the first few chapters selling you the book you just bought. While I understand much of the population has more than one partner, Marcy Michaels seems to think if you don't, you're missing out. Her constant reminders about protecting yourself from STD's and the like made me feel like I was reading some sort of trash for a porno, instead of learning how to become more intimate with my husband.She makes logical sense and provides some basic information that will encourage and improve any level of oral sex, but the feel of the book was not for someone who is in a monogamous relationship."
2,....,"Atleast there are pictures...need a few more details however. I was looking for a book that will give direct technique information for things I did not already know, this book is not that."
3,To much talk about preparation,"I know one needs to properly prepare for everything, but the exercise routines listed in this book are way too much to do and to remember. The last 10-15 pages were a little helpful, but not anything that I haven't heard before. I agree with the other reviewer...save your money and just set your pride aside and ask your partner what he likes!"
3,Just average,"A little hard on the reading. Not much I didn't already know. But there were very good tips for the, should I say beginner???"
4,Blow Him Away: How to Give Him Mind-Blowing Oral Sex,"The book was received in a timely manner but I didn't receive a confirmation email saying that the book as sent, in route, delivered."
1,Turn off,The tongue exercises where such an unbelievable turn-off for my wife that she hasn't attempted any oral sex since she started reading it.
1,Are they running out of Ideas?,"Although this appears to be a new book by Florence Farr. This book, The Book of the Grand Words, is in fact a chapter from Florence Farr's book _Egyptian Magic_. It is unfortunate that Kessinger Publishing or Amazon.com have not indicated that this is just a reprint of a chapter."
4,A nice compilation,"This is a very nice compilation of recent Tangerine Dream tracks between 1990 - 2000. However, it's sadly missing some tracks that I would have liked to have seen from Goblins' Club and Oasis. Too bad. But overall, a good mix of stuff for fans too lazy to burn their own mixes and a good intro for those who don't really know TD. For 2 full cd's it's a very good price too!"
4,Dipping Back Into The Archives,"What was initially issued for promotional purposes received some minor tweaks and then released to the general public.The 24 tracks span a number of periods for TD - the end of the ""Melrose Years,"" the ""Seattle Years"" and into the ""Millennium/TDI Years"" - in a nice sampler for those who want to explore the vast catalog that is available.There is a fascinating continuum within the tracks that is heard within this interesting collection."
3,Overpriced,"I bought this back pack for my daughter in 3rd grade. It lasted about 2 months, before one of the wheels broke off. I would have given this item a much higher rating if the price would not have been so high on it. For this price I could have purchased something much more durable"
3,Rolling backpack not as expected,"The zippers are not easy to open and close. There is not as much inside space as a regular backpack. The rolling handle is short (and this is not a toddler backpack). The water bottle is made of cheap, flimsy plastic. It did not close tight and leaked. I threw it away in the recycle on the second day.On an upnote, my daughter likes it. It is very pretty. The handle goes up and down very easy and it converts to form a comfortable shoulder backpack. Hopefully it will make it for the remaining 6 monthes of the school year.Overall, I am disappointed. If it was $20.00, I would chalk it up to ""you get what you pay for"". For the $35.00 - definitly not worth the price."
4,Pentatonic pleasures,"Ethiopia has one of the more intriguing indigenous piano traditions in the world. Ethiopian jazz piano playing has been heard in an ensemble context on cds in the fine Ethiopiques series. But this may be the first recording of Ethiopian songs for solo piano to be widely distributed (outside of the Ethiopian community) in the US. And it's a lovely recording, by a talented young player currently living in the US."
5,A highly talented pianist who will continue to develop and impress!,"Of the two extant DVDs that feature Yundi Li, this one is the best. Li's playing of the four Chopin Scherzi was enjoyable. He really impressed me as a young up and coming pianist. One can see that Li has grown incredibly as a pianist in only four years if one compares Li's playing on this DVD to his already noteworthy playing at the 14th International Chopin Competition when Li was only 18. I look forward to seeing Li, and a number of other talented young pianists (e.g. Arcadi Volodos, who is perhaps the most extraordinary new pianist out there today) develop their talents and continue to please. The extras on this DVD were fun. There are video promotions similar to MTV videos featuring Yundi Li as a heart throb. More importantly, the DVD comes with a bonus of Li playing a movement of the Chopin Concerto No. 1 in Warsaw at the International Competition -- a real bonus!"
3,"So so, but so what?","Man, it's amazing these fawning reviews....Li's performances of Chopin basically imitate those of Horowitz. Li brings nothing new to the table. He makes a mistake on the third scherzo, and you can see how he reacts to it, following the completely misplaced dissonance with a guarded and wooden performance. OK, he can get 99% of the notes right, but is he making music?"
5,awesome book,"I bought this book and its companion (Mom Mine) for my toddler (23 months) as a gift when we brought our newborn home from the hospital last month. I wanted these books to help her understand that our feelings for her haven't changed with the new addition to our family. She loves these books and asks us to read them to her several times a day. The pictures are so cute, and since she can be quick to turn the pages, there's not a lot of reading involved. She understands the message of the books, too. She smiles and leans in for a hug when we finish each one. I would highly recommend these books if you have a toddler and are getting ready to have a new baby. These books have only helped strengthen the bond we already had with our firstborn."
3,"If you need a smooth transition from single into dual, this is not the item for you","If you need stainless, this is not the part for you.I just needed y-pipe, so it's ok for me.One of the reasons to get a Y-pipe is to split the exhaust back into dual.With that being said, the dual pipes inside the Y-Pipe have about 1/3"" lip.This will create somewhat a ""chambered muffler"" effect.This is not bad for me since i only needed 1.75"" duals, and in fact will help me keep some noise down.However, if you need full 2"" dual outs without any exhaust turbelence, this wouldn't be item for you.Now, if you don't care about performance, then this item would work just fine and fit 2"" piping."
5,good y-pipe,Bought one of these when I rebuilt my truck's exhaust system. Inexpensive and does the job. Nothing really to write home about.
5,Perfect,Great product. Beautiful welds and it arrived within two days with my Prime account. Will be used on my '06 Dakota when I install a cat-back system later this month. Hello power gains..
2,disappointed,i ordered this product because it was described as a 2.5 inch y-pipe. but the two inlets are only 2 inch. now i have to find a proper pipe and wait for delivery.
5,Awesome worship,"As a fan of Kathy's for years, I was delighted with this CD. While I love the more upbeat music, I enjoy this CD for quiet reflection and worship with the Lord. The lyrics and soft music invade my quiet moments.This is one of the few CD's that I consider an absolute must in my collection."
5,sets the tone for my day,"Listening to this CD allows me to ""pray"" in the midst of my chaotic days. Kathy's soothing voice coupled with these inspiring songs creates an atmosphere in my heart and home where peace can reign. The arrangements are classy - not over done, like Kathy's beautiful vocals"
3,A real surprise,"I was really surprised by this one by troccoli. She doesn't usually do worship songs. Her style is '40's jazz. Yet, this compliation was good. It would have been nice if she had sung at least one of the songs all the way through. So, in truth this album was just one long medley. I'm not sure who desighed the cover of the cd, but the head - body proportions were out of purportion. It looked like someone just placed her head on someone else's body. I just hope she no longer uses this cover photographer/designer to do anymore cover work for her."
1,Sleepy,"I got Kathy Troccoli's first album, Stubborn Love, back in 1982. I liked it. Then her follow-up came out in 1984, Heart And Soul, and I loved that one! It was among my top 10 favorite Christian pop albums of the 1980s.Then I lost track of her. This is the first album I've heard since the soulful, lively Heart And Soul. I knew her sound would have changed vastly since then, but I wasn't expecting this.This is a very slow and sleepy album. She plays various worship songs and hymns on a piano, all at incredibly slow tempo, often flowing from one song to the next, but they all sound exactly the same. I find it incredibly boring...so boring, in fact, that I'm getting rid of the album."
3,Performs it's job but not well,I expected more from this adapter. Technically it does exactly what is advertised but there are some design flaws with it. It doesn't fit as tight to the controller as the original 360 headset connector. It feels loose when inserted into the controller. The volume wheel is tight just like someone else said. I also think the components might be low quality but I can't prove it. It could use some more engineering but shows good potential.
2,deceptive product description,"Please be aware that this adapter does not work for PC headsets. After I received this product and discovered that it was not compatible, I had to look very hard in the description to find out why. PC headsets apparently do not qualify as ""any headset"" like many of the glowing reviews seem to indicate, and the splitter does nothing to help with the PC headset. I wish someone had been much more clear about this before I purchased this product."
1,Don't buy.....,"I would not recommend this to anyone, as it doesn't well at all. The plug is too short and does not connect well."
1,Very very very bad,Please avoid this product unless all you are looking for is the splitter. That is the only thing in the package that works. the fitment of the adapter is so poor that when my head set is plugged in the xbox doesn't even recognize that it is connected. It is visibly lose at all times and there isn't anything you can do to fix it. I tried it on multiple controllers with two different head sets.. same result. buyer.... you have been warned.
3,Disappointed!,I bought this to try and repair something that was broken on a very expensive xbox 360 headset. Didn't work at all. Very disappointed.
1,"Piontless adapter, don't waste your money!!!","i thought this adapter was going to allow me to use any headphones i wanted... after relizing that i needed a 2.5mm plug (not standard) i wasted an additional 6 dollars at radio shack, to buy an adapter for my adapter... got home and it still doesn't work. so after tons of research i discover that only microsoft products will work for it, although it clearly states on the back of the packaging ""-Can also be used with any headset with a 2.5mm jack plug"" what a waste of my time and money... i should have just got a regular headset from game stop... f this stupid product!"
3,good idea horrible product,"I bought this for my husband and a third party head set because he is always on xbox live so i thought this would be better. Well when he opened it for Christmas he was really excited he opened it right away to try it out well, to our surprise the sound quality is HORRIBLE. I gave a 3 because it was a good idea."
2,Should be a lot better,"I had bought this same product awhile ago before circuit city closed their stores down and was happy with it for the 1st week or 2. After that it felt like something just fell apart inside it. The volume button became extremely hard to move. If you barely touch the thing while its plugged in it makes a whole lot of static in your headset like the whole thing just does not connect right. So i decided maybe to try again since nobody seems to make headsets with this type built in anymore and it is a lot easier keeping the mute and volume right under the controller instead of dangling somewhere around your chest. Well it turns out to just be crap. I would not buy this product again. Everybody keeps saying they get an annoying static noise when I use this but whenever I bypass it, my voice comes out crystal clear. Microsoft needs to make an official version although then it would probably be triple the price knowing Microsoft."
2,Works Sometimes,"During my lunch period I like to walk 2 to 3 miles. It takes the sensor, device located on my hip, about 1/2 mile before it finally kicks in even if I should change the sensor battery. Once it kicks in it works great, monitors the distance and speed of my walk. I'am disappointed in the inconsistant operation of this device."
1,Worst Purchase EVER!,"This watch was ridiculous! I tried 4 different times to get this watch to work on long runs. Only once did I get the GPS to connect to the watch. I thought for $165 I could get a decent alternative to the Garmin - I was wrong. I have returned the watch, which is a WHOLE story in itself. I still haven't gotten credited for the return after 2 weeks. I called Jomashop, which Amazon outsourcers to and after sitting on hold for 20 minutes was told I would get my refund maybe in a week. Hum.............Not a great shopping experience."
4,Timex Bodylink with Heart Rate and GPS,"This watch does everything that I expected it to do after reading other's reviews. One thing to remember: For me, the watch will not pick up the signal from the GPS if it first received the signal from the heart rate strap. This means that you need to turn on the GPS and lock-on before you put the heart rate strap on."
4,Timex Ironman T5F011 Does what is says,"I found the Ironman T5F011 to work as suggested. Even though I run an area with tall trees the GPS held signal almost all of the time. Accuracy (GPS) was within acceptable parameters with the heart monitor spot on.My guess is if there is trouble it is because it takes several readings of the manual and trials to understand how to configure the watch.However, once you understand it, it works great."
3,Geheime Mission,I was wondering if anyone had an English version of this book. Gimme an email at Michalobe2002@yahoo.com. I am willing to pay pretty good money for it.
5,Great price and convenience for this hard-to-locate item,"We're talking Orbit irrigation control valve washers and seals so it's hard to get excited about this kit - but this is a convenient find and useful for the widely used Orbit control valves. If you need it, buy it here rather than running all over town looking for this specialty item."
3,Baby Einstein Cow Puppet,"I was excited to order this puppet for my grandson and my preschool class.I am disappointed that it does not look like the cow puppet on the Baby Einstein video. With the name in front, I thought that I was ordering a look-alike from the video series. This puppet looks like any cow puppet so the colors of the mouth are not vibrant as the one in the video.It is comfortable to wear but the ears will flop and fall over the face most of the time. There is no way to place your hand to keep this from happening.Again, I was disappointed that it wasn't as colorful as the cow puppet on the video."
4,Good help,this book was full of good info and good photos of stages of skin problems. This is a must own book for all Southern Californians.
4,What if the book was what it's purported to be?,"Interesting vignettes of history, but +/- 85% of each essay describes what actually happened, not the alternatives (they were a few exceptions).Despite that, I'll probably still buy Volume II."
4,Wrong Title,"The title of this book should have been: ""Defining moments in History and What could have been"". Each easy is about 4/5 Historical review for a situation and 1/5 or less about What could have been. There are a few chapters that had almost nothing on ""What If?"". However, all these moments in History are of such great importance and sometimes little understood, that I believe just learning about them from this book is worth the read. The ""What If's?"" are interesting in about half the chapters, some thou just don't make sense. In the end I am glad I read the book and feel I have learned a few things I never knew about History and how things could have been different."
3,Very spotty,"Like many collections, the quality of this work depends a great deal on the particular author of that section. Several areas are excellent, particularly those dealing with the civil war and ancient history. Several others are rather poor, often giving little facts and making considerable leaps.Every historian, amateur or otherwise, enjoys playing the What If game. By its very nature it is speculative and, even if done well, is fun to pick holes in. Unfortunately, several parts of this work make too many assumptions while giving too little supporting data to back it up.That said, several parts of it are fun and, for whatever reason, there are a lot of used copies around. For $... it is worth picking up to read the few excellent chapters it contains."
3,Hits and Misses,"As with any work containing input from a variety of authors, there are good and bad sections. I was disappointed that the majority of essays contained far too much information about what did happen than concentrating on what might have happened, which is what I assumed the purpose of the book to be. James MacPherson's contribution is an excellent example of how the entire work should have been structured, but unfortunately was not. Counterfactual history is a fascinating field, and this work contributes to it, but not as much as it could have were all the contributions of equal strength."
3,Eh?!?,"Okay, I'll be honest. I haven't actually read this volume, so I'm basing my opinion on the earlier article that appeared in MHQ early in 1998. And the result is... I hope that the amount of counterfactual speculation in this book-length volume exceeds what was in the magazine entry as otherwise it would be pretty pitiful. The entries in the magazine essay suggested some good possibilities, but none of the authors had any guts to carry their ideas further. I hope (knock wood) that in this book version that they developed some ""intestinal fortitide""."
2,"interesting idea, but done poorly","Interesting ideas, often badly written and apparently with little or no editing."
1,Garbage,"They state Europe would have been better off had we been defeated by moslems? They deny the foundations of our very existence. How can ""distinguished"" historians write this? Waste of money - Literary trash - leave it on the shelf."
2,-Good Ideas but not enough depth-,"I am a dedicated history and counterfactual history enthusiast. I have read just about all of the alternate history I can lay my hands on - I think it's a wonderful means of learning how close we've come to disaster. This book was a fascinating read in terms of topic, but had very little to offer in terms of analysis. Each short essay explores a different possibility, and granted many of them go into some depth explaining how the possibility might have come to pass, but the level of depth included for each scenario is truly insufficient. Kenneth Macksey, on the other hand, really understands how much information is necessary for an alternate history: in his books, The Hitler Options, and Invasion, he gives excellent alternate history accounts. So does Peter Tsouras in Gettysburg. This book just doesn't give enough. The best thing it has accomplished has been to give recognition to a valid means of studying history."
2,Disappointing,"Most of the essays contained in the book are mere accounts of things that actually happened. Only at the very end of each chapter is there any mention of actual alternate history and then it is often very short and only presents a general overview of what the world would be like if different events had taken place. The exceptions are probably the essays about World War I, Hitler and Midway; otherwise the book is just a collection of information that could be readily found in textbooks."
3,Formulaic and a bit repetitious,"This is fun to read, and the military historians do a GREAT job giving the context of the battles and the historical impact they had. However, most of the ""What If's"" end up being ""the world would be a very different place."" Well, duh.On the plus side, it was unusual to read a book like this written in 1999, before the anti-Bush/anti-America frenzy permeated academia. The essays were written at a time when military success and the peaceful administration of government were approved of. Nice!The best essay in the collection was Thomas Flemings's 13 what-if's about the American Revolution.////////////This book pointed me toward a few other things for my wish list:Cecelia Holland's historical novelsTheodore Rabb's ""The Secret History of the Mongols"" and ""Climate and History""Thomas Fleming's ""1776: The Year of Illusions"""
2,Too much background needed,"Many of the writers presuppose that the reader knows a great deal about each historical situation. I'm all right in this area, but I frequently became confused to some of the references. I'm sure this is heaven for the historical buff, but it all left me a little cold."
3,What If?,"The basic premise is that authors identified historical turning points and hypothesized as to how history might have been altered with a different outcome. A great idea. I liked it, but found a lot of variability w/in the authors' interpretations of this premise, and their assumptions about their readers' knowledge levels. So sometimes when reading an unfamiliar scenario, I would get truly lost between fact and conjecture. I read very little history, which didn't help. At the time it seemed somewhat boring, but several times found myself mentally returning to some of the essays and ideas. There was substantial variability in the writing quality as well."
2,WHAT IF....WHO KNOWS?,"I found this book interesting in part but I cannot really recommend it for this reason: It is possible to take any historical, natural or personal event and mentally change an element in the sequence of events that apparently brought it about, then write a story about how things might have worked out differently. The resultant work is not history, natural history or biography, it is pure fantasy. Historical events are so complex that even knowing that something has acutally happened, it is only with the utmost difficulty that historians attempt to explain what has happened or why. The idea that a historian sitting in an armchair could change around some causative event and then explain what the resultant events would be is sheer nonsense. No man or machine is brilliant enough to do that."
3,Pretty good for the most part,"Each essay does a great job of outlining the facts leading up to the battle and the book is worthwhile just for that. But the ""what if"" scenarios are for the most part unrealistic - for example that Europe would have been better off if it had been under Moslem control in the middle ages. It makes you wonder what some of these guys and gals are smoking."
2,So-so,The premise is great but most of the items read like lectures and some do not have an alternate. Was not thrilled.
2,arrived damaged so I am returning it,"the book I received was unusable. It had a strange bright blue sticky substance across the bottom of the book, which glued at least two thirds of the pages together and I could not read it without damaging the pages.I am returning it.It did arrive promptly though."
2,MISTAKES,"very interesting views about what if scenarios. my interest in this book faded after reading STEPHEN W. SEARS ""A Confederate Cannae and Other Scenarios"". His essay stated that Stonewall Jackson was killed at the Battle of Bull Run 1861 By a ""federal volley"" wich mangled his left arm.Stonewall Jackson was actually killed at chancellorsville in 1863 by friendly fire. These mistakes just made me wonder if other facts in the book where correct or not."
2,Not the same as in the picture and not paperback,"I received a hardback book with a different cover to the one in the picture. However, I believe (I hope!) it contains the same text as the one in the picture so I will keep this item, as I can't be bothered to return it for the price I paid."
4,Intriguing and thought provoking,What if WWI was a brief six-month war? No Nazi Germany? No WWII? No communist Russia? No Cold War? These speculative essays really make you think about how the world got to where it is today.
4,counterfactual history at its best,"History, like everything else, has fads that come and go. It seems that now counterfactual history is the fad of the day. Nevertheless, the exercise presented in What if? is, to say the least, very interesting. But is it useful? I believe it is, but not from the point of view of the historian, because history, no matter how you want to put it, is about things that happened not about things that didn't happen. What if? is useful from the point of view of the decision maker, and to be more specific, from the point of view of the decision making process. Some essays contained in the book base their assumptions on circumstance, or a chance, like the famous ""lost orders"" that influence the outcome of the US Civil War. Others essays, the ones that are really useful, explore the decisions behind the historical events. Only these essays serve a wider purpose, not only of entertainment, but of greater insight into things that truly could have been different."
2,Dissapointing,"I like alternate history and thought this would be interesting. However, it was rather dissapointing. Battles are described in detail but what ifs are barely mentioned(several paragraphs at the most). Since that's the title of the book I expected a lot more than that."
1,UN-inspirational,Dull and boring. Nothing in-spirit-ational in this music. Neither the guitarist nor the volcalists. NOT RECOMMENDED.
1,Blu-ray version has issues,"O.K. i am not going to mention how lame this movie was, and i am a fan of b-flicks.However, i must point out the issue with the Blu-ray disk as there are audio problems with this release.BOTH the Dolby and DTS tracks have the same issue with the sound field. The audio surround mix comes from the FRONT LEFT, CENTRE, and RIGHT REAR, the front right and rear left are silent, who the heck mixed this sound track? what a mess up, not to mention it was REALLY annoying hearing all the right front audio coming from the right rear speaker.But wait folks!! it gets better!! even the stereo 2.0 track is messed up but with a diff'rent problem, in the 2.0 track there is a slight echo with the ambient sounds (like a car driving by) but the voices don't have the echo but come from a combo of the front left and centre channel.buyer beware!!!"
2,don't waste your money and time on this one,"if you are sci-fi movies addict and just want to gobble up anything related to this genre no matter what, then go ahead. otherwise, don't do it. this is such a ridiculous movie with outlandish scenario. i've tried so hard to sit it thru but finally decided to bail out and went where the toilet bowl located, never thought going back and tried it again."
1,its better then watching paint dry,"Strange disappearances and cover-ups proliferate in a Northern waterfront town, and reporter Jake Roth (John Cassini) shares information with cynical archaeologist Lloyd Walker (Gil Bellows) after his dig site is ruled off limits by city official Korshaft (Serge Houde). Lloyd discovers strange mounds of organic material in an underground chamber near city hall, and finds a friend in ex-astronaut Liz Quinlan (Daryl Hannah), an attractive city troubleshooter who also suggests that they pool resources------blahblahblah.you get the point! its not so good! but better then watching paint dry---:p"
2,"Not the worst Sci-Fi movie, but close.","Not the worst movie ever but bad script and plot line.SPOILER - My favorite stupid plot error; Hey we need weapons so they buy machetes, then kill four cops in full SWAT gear but don't bother to take any of their weapons. Earlier Gil Bellows character knocks a cop out and steals his full uniform, including gun and it goes missing as soon as he gets back in the exterminator's van."
1,dreadfull,"it has to be one of the worse movies i have ever seen, even on blu-ray, complete waste of money"
3,good sci-fi film,"although a made for cable film,this ones worth a look.A colony of Praying Mantis from another universe plan on using the human race for food.Seems that the insects home planet ran out of food they needed to survive.They use human skin to cover themselves to look like normal humans, are the top officials of city hall as they ""prosses"" humans to make a liquid they can suck up to nurish their body's.Sort of a insects from outer space establishing a ""Star Bucks"" serving a human liquified delights."
3,Half good (not half bad),"I rarely buy a movie I haven't seen, but I bought this thinking that with Daryl Hannah for decoration and Gil Bellows as the lead, it had to be worth $4.99. At the end of part I was thinking ""Hey, not bad!"", but part II was terrible acting and poor plotting. What finally made it ""bad"" for me was the ""aliens in disguise"" business. At first they seemed to be using mind control, but by the end we see Hannah's character jump out of her rubber suit, instantly becoming several sizes too big to have ever been inside the suit. Bellows looked really silly holding Hannah's empty ""human suit"" and staring up at the giant monster. sigh. At least he didn't actually have sex with her (but he came close!).Oh, well. The kids will enjoy it."
3,"Kinda silly, but fun...","I have to admit the film was silly, and had been done better previously, but I found myself watching with some interest and amusement. Gil Bellows saves the film from being a total washout. He plays a good hero. Daryl Hannah has often been criticized, and if this was her comeback, it didn't work. I really loved her in ""Splash"" and ""Steel Magnolias"". She's not convincing as a mean person. Campbell Scott played crazy, and he was okay in a difficult role. Not bad, really, but it will satisfy those who enjoy movies ""so bad, they're good"". I was entertained."
3,Non-stick coating didn't last,"I bought this griddle in January 2006. It got used 2-3 times per week on our glass-top GE electric range with bridge burner. It worked great while it lasted. However, even though it was always hand-washed (this thing doesn't even fit in our dishwasher!), the non-stick coating started to flake off sometime around summer of 2008.For comparison's sake, given the same care our Kirkland/Costco non-stick cookware pieces have lasted considerably longer than this and several of them get used much more frequently. The non-stick surface on that cookware looks almost good as new after 4-5 years.So while this Circulon product worked great while it lasted, I have to say I'm very disappointed that it didn't last longer given the price point. I'm not sure what to try next but it won't be another Circulon nonstick product"
4,Great Griddle,"I basically only use this once a week when I do big breakfasts. It's nice for pancakes, french toast, etc. there is enough surface room to get them done faster. I'm trying to think of more uses for it! If you have price compared elsewhere then you know this is a great buy. Highly reccomended."
4,Quicklee not for all bars,"Quicklee is an excellent quick-change collar for some bars. I use it on a Texas Power Bar with no problem, but it is too big for a Pendlay Oly bar, for which I had to get a pair of Bulldog collars. So, make sure that you match it with the bar you have."
1,Plastic broke during first week,"Do not confuse with the metal ones. Worthless, plastic rim broke during first week during normal use. Sounds like this is a common problem."
3,rating of quick release,I ordered a total of 6 sets of these and at least 4 of them had the rim break off the first time we used them. I had to use superglue to glue the rim back on. NOT what you expect for a NEW item. Disappointing but more trouble to send them back than to glue them. The manufacturer needs to fix this.
2,Don't buy,"During the first use I dropped one and the lip poped off. The section of the collar that you pull (what I'm calling the lip) is not attached by anything else than pressure/friction. I reattached the lip with some super glue... but it's not tough at all. I wouldn't buy these again.When they're on they do hold the plates in place... so I guess that gives it a 2 star.EDIT: I've since bought these ""Olympic Lock-Jaw Barbell Collar""They ARE AWESOME. GET THEM INSTEAD. http://www.amazon.com/Lock-Jaw-Collar-7642-Olympic-Barbell/dp/B000XUC11I/ref=pd_sim_sg_1"
1,Broke during first use,The plastic broke the very first time I used these. Hopefully I can glue them back together. They are very light and flimsy. Not good.
5,Just what I was looking for,"I have read numerous books about affirmations, and they basically just say to repeat the affirmation over and over or write it. I tried this and never got any results and it seemed to be rather difficult and time consuming. This book gives you something different, you write one main long affirmation only once and then the short form affirmation every day. She also has a lot of information on forgiving others and hundreds of ideas for affirmations. If you are interested inn affirmations, I recommend getting this one first (if I had gotten this one first I wouldn't have wasted my money on the other ones)."
5,Affirmations,"I've got 'Anne's book now for a few months, the book as been a tremendous help for me,my life as got better,richer and fulfilling. Affirmations your passport to hapiness is my guiding light. I plan to offer a copy of the book to my Christmas gift recipients."
5,Fantastic Tool for Everyone,"I had added the concepts in this book on Affrmations by Anne Marie Evers into my Life Learning Tool Box. I believe in her concepts and teachings. She gives very simple, yet effecive exercises on forgiveness, self-esteem, loving self, releasing negativity,dropping weight and many others subjects. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a Life Learner or anyone who is interested in finding ways to improve their lives. It is my constant companion. I feel it should be in every Library and Book Store in the Countty."
5,Affirmations-Your Passport to Happiness,"This is a great book, it is well written and easy to follow. In many ways this book has changed my life. After I read it, I began using affirmations on a regular basis and I have been creating my life much more to my liking. I am a personal empowerment coach and therefore work in this kind of medium all the time now, AnneMarie's book I find it easy to follow for many of my clients and a great way to get people started on taking control of their lives. I highly recommend this book if you want to create your life as you want it."
5,Take Along Thomas's Emily,"This Thomas item is just the right size to fit a child's pocket. The item is durable, colorful and has a good magnet for linking several cars together. My ""granddaughter"" loves them."
1,Price jacked up for Christmas ...,"When my friend put this in her son's Wishlist, it was going for $8. When I bought it, unsuspecting (because I'm old), it was listed at $19. This isn't a collectible ... this is just a toy. The seller basically jacked the price over 100%. Look elsewhere and you can find it for $9."
3,Not all it is cracked up to be,"I bought this book for my 3 year old son since he has an interest in science. When I got the book I was disappointed in the experiments listed, such as disecting an osyter and fish. Not that I have problems with that, but I was looking for something that you can find objects around the house and more cause and reaction type thing."
3,Birthday Party Fun,"Bought this and a few other books for a nephew's birthday party. With the right planning and materials, the children loved it."
3,ok,"My wife, kids and I are ok with what we bought. Amazon is definitely a great place for home school supplies. Not as nice as I expected."
2,template,I was a little disappointed in that I received only one template. Granted the description never said how many but the image displays three.
4,Nice to hear Christian House music,"It's really good to see Christians in the electronic music industry. As a fan of house, techno, trance,etc. Jesus Christ is Lord, Rapture, I lift My Hands, are my personal favorites on this CD. The message in River of Life is good, but since I'm not a big fan of rap music, the I personally didn't dig the musical aspect of it. <><"
5,Nice setup for deep frying a turkey,Last turkey day I bought something like this at a local store for so much more.After buying it I realized that I need one of those hook things to lower and raise the bird from the oil. I came to Amazon to look for a hook and found this pot for so much less than what I paid and it included the hook I was looking for.I was able to cook a 15lbs and 18lbs turkey in this (they were snug in there without touching the sides and cooked fine). I like how the pot has higher walls than the one I originally had which makes it a bit safer when the oil level rises and splashes.The thermometer is not included like the picture.
1,Dora the Explorer Bike,"I was very dissastisfied with the product. The 16 inch DORA bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter. We had to keep it in the box until Christmas Eve, so that she wouldn't find it. When I started assembling it that night, we found no training wheels or SEAT. I was very upset for obvious reasons, how do you tell a 4 yr old that Santa forgot the SEAT and training wheels for her bike?"
1,Terrible,"I bought a ZR80 about 3 years ago. It really seemed the perfect camera for me, new mommy who wants to record all the baby stuff. I got lovely videos and everything worked perfectly for almost 2 years. Suddenly, the screen started to appear black. It would record only the sound but not the image. It worked randomly, sometimes it would record the image, sometimes it just wouldn't..... very frustrating and disappointing! I have read other reviews stating similar problems. I will never get another Canon camera, as I don't plan to replace it every 2 years!!"
1,"Don't buy, camera doesn't last!!","We got this camera 3-years ago as a baby shower gift. The camera does not have high quality video indoors, the battery life is really short (lasts only about 30 minutes after being fully charged), and we ended up with the black screen of death (see reviews for Samsung SCD23 MiniDV Camcorder with 2.5 LCD). I would expect a video camera to last much longer than 3-years. I'm very disapointed with this camera and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,worst vacation camcorder EVER!!!!!!!!!,"I took it to europe thinking I would get great video, instead I arrive at London and it says SORRY NO LIGHT SOURCE FOUND. Ever since then it has been pitch black vido and picture. Even though it says it has a warranty, they say I broke it no refunds. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, GET JVC!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Poor video during indoor recordings,"I bought this comcorder because of the zoom, price and ease to use. I was inmediately disappointed. The video looks grainy if your shooting is inside the house. In my case, most of family scenes occur inside the house!!! The audio quality is poor. The camncorder can not capture voices more than five feet away unless you are yelling. Fortunately, someone stole it and I decided to buy a Sony HC20. With the Sony the quality of the video and audio are superb.Sincerely, I would not recommend the Canon ZR80 not its predecesors."
3,really nice camera but some flaws,i have had this camera for about a year and it is good. one of the problems was that when in low light it dosn't deliver really great quality. one time when i was connecting it to my computer it wasn't working so i had to send it back canon and they repaired it. another thing is the battery life. the battery that comes with it lasts a short while. it seems to drain the battery really fast and i am constantly charging it. it's a good camera but next time i would choose another one.
2,Crappy Quality Indoors,"Some of the reviews here state that this camera produces good quality video is false. I am wondering what they are comparing the quality to. My camera (Canon ZR80) is horrible. When shooting indoors with light coming through a slider door into the living room the image is very grainy. I compared it to one of the old ""suit case"" analog camera and the analog camera produces I would say 100% better image quality than Canon ZR80.I bought this camera about 6 months ago and am very unhappy. I paid over $400 at Sears and I feel like I got ripped off by Canon. If you are planing to shoot vodeo indoors and want to have a decent quality image, do not buy Canon ZR80."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS SERIES!!!!!!!!,"I wanted to make really good movies at a low cost. My first camcorder was a samsung hi8 camcorder but I wanted a DV camcorder for a low price so I purchased the Canon ZR80. I was satisfied at first. I loved the effects and picture quality outdoors. The indoor quality was really bad. The nightshot or lowlight mode makes the picture brighter but more grainier and slow frame rate. After 1/2 a year it had problems connecting to my computer. Canon repaired it. After 1 year and a half, the camcorder died on me. I read other reviews and other people complained of other or similar models in the ZR series dying after the 1 year warranty was up. This was ridiculous. I am never going with Canon again. It died during the summer so I'm getting the Panasonic GS300 for christmas. DON'T BUY A CANON ZR CAMCORDER!!!!!!!!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT EVER GET THIS CAMCORDER! EVER!! Sure it works for the first year, but after the first year or so, you will start noticing strange noises coming through the camera, and you WILL eventually get the black screen of death. Once you get ""THE SCREEN"" you are basically done with that camera. The majority of people who get this camera also get this strange, weird problem. And as far as I know, there is no way around it. The only way NOT to get this problem, is to simply NOT get this camera. If you are going to get a camera for under 500$ get a Sanyo or pretty much any Sony camcorder. They will work, and also come out to a fraction of the cost. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMCORDER!"
5,What a collection!,"This book is amazing! As a bilingual Pre-K teacher, I recommend this collection for every young class. The Spanish nursery rhymes are classics and the English adaptations help make the book even more enjoyable for bilingual readers. These poems make meaningful rhymes in both languages that are sure to delight!"
4,great resource!,"This book gives such a wonderful array of Spanish rhymes and fingerplays. The illustrations are adorable. The families I work with recognized several of the rhymes, which is what I'd wanted - - - reminders to them about rhymes they could use to enrich their children's language development. There are cute, rhythmic English translations as well, but it's helpful to know that they are only based on the same theme, not at all literal translations."
5,Love them,"I love this book, it has a lot of the stories I grew up listening/singing to and now I get to share those with my son."
4,It's canned air...,"... as for the canned air aspect of this product, it's just that. A 10 oz. can of canned air, to shoot away dust and whatnot, with a little plastic straw nozzle attachment. And it works great.Note however, that this is a two-pack of 10 oz. cans. I've ordered this three times now, and it's always a two-pack. The model number for this item corresponds to a two-pack on Google as well.Plus, as it's a DOT restricted item, this will ship GROUND ONLY, whether or not you have Amazon Prime."
4,"content OK, but problems with the typo density...","(...) First let me remark that talking about content, the book is very good. It contains elegance, rigor and the explanations seem OK. The problem however with the book is the typo density of most of the proofs. Some long proofs are presented as one continuous block without even no linefeed in between the facts. This makes some parts of the book rather uncomfortable to study from. I can 't stop starting to read these beautifull theory, but mostly, after one hour I give up, because ""my eyes start dancing"" ....Tip for the author and editor : take exactly the same text, but spread it over 600 pages instead of 350 pages. This will make the book more expensive, but I will definitely buy it.."
2,Way too dense,"The entire book is written in thm. prop. lemma. def. etc... form, with few breaks from this sequence of statements and proofs. While this seems to be the preferred style for a lot of textbooks, frankly I found it boring to read, and difficult to understand. That being said, the book covers a wide variety of topics, and goes into a good level of depth on each. The material is definitely worthwhile, but Browder seems to share the all too common mathematics teachers' curse of poor communications skills."
4,Advanced Undergrad Math Text,"This book is concise and straightforward. It serves well as a reference when you're trying to solve problems since it follows the definition, theorem, proof, proposition, lemma, example layout. However the block style writing of the proofs is hard to read."
3,Turn about is fair play!,"A truly eclectic Ink Spot array: the 1935 & 1939 original group mixed with Bill Kenny's group after he & Charlie Fuqua split, plus 2 Charioteers tunes that have no bearing on the Spots. The major tunes are by George Grant's current group. To top it off there is a Modernaires group doing ""Juke Box Sat. Night"" to add confusion. The original group items were ""pirated"" by another label from the Totem LP: hence the ""turnabout."" If a new fan would like to get a cross section ofInk Spot groups, by all means, this is the one to give you that."
1,"Beautiful Grill Pan, BUT...","It is a beautiful pan, if you have the right stove to use it. The grooves (""hills"") [BTW, they are parallel + not concentric as the Amazon description states] have ""valleys"" on the bottom of the pan. If you have a gas stove, which I have not, - you will probably be very pleased. Don't expect to use this pan on a ceramic cooking surface or just a plain electric coil element as there is not enough contact between heating source + pan; you might damage either. I gave it away to my college kid w/ a gas stove."
1,Too much work,"I have had this pan for a year. I bought it because it was on sale and was shopping around for a new pot set. I figured it would be a good test run on the Circulon brand. It grills great,but you will spend twice the cooking time cleaning the pan! I could not imagine how much food would be left on this pan if someone without great eyesight cleaned it. You have to go along each crevice on both sides of the grill gooves to get the food out. It is very time consuming and tedious and just not worth it. I wonder if the Calphalon pan is the same??? As far as the pot set I ended up buying-Analon Titanium 12 piece. Highly reccomend it."
4,A mix of mellow as well upbeat works,"The single piece that sold me on this album is ""Ja Sha Taan"" by Fun Da Mental. It is an upbeat piece featuring a good Pakistani Qawwali. The other reason I bought this compilation was because of Talvin Singh. I hadn't heard of ""Ghoom Charakhana"" but I'm an avid fan of Singh. I think he is the best solo artist among the Asian Underground Movement and he didn't disappoint me with this piece. ""Sweet Pain"" by Joi is another excellent remix, but this single is on ""Star Rise"", a compilation of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan remixes. Incidentally, Fun Da Mental is also on ""Star Rise"" and they deliver beautifully. The remaining pieces on the CD were too mellow for my taste. It was relaxing to the point that it lulled me to sleep.If you are interested in getting into this genre of Asian Underground music, ""Anokha: Soundz of the Asian Underground"" is the best place to whet your apetite. It is probably the best compilation of Underground music yet."
4,An Aural Massage,"On repeated listenings of Asian Travels I find that more often than not I am asleep before the end of Shankar's ""All for You"" track. Is this a bad thing? NO.The order of the remixes works beautifully like an aural massage. The earlier tracks (""Ja Sha Taan"" through ""Sweet Pain"") stimulate and the latter tracks (""Delirium"" through to the afforementioned Shankar mix) calm and pacify. While I am particularly enamoured with ""Ghoom Charakhana"", there really isn't a wasted member in this set.Some listeners may make the mistake of listening only for hard-core grooves--don't go there! Remember that the musical traditions of the Indian subcontinent often tilt toward the meditational. Sit back, relax, and take a journey to dreamland. On the morning after, you won't be ashamed with whom you fell asleep..."
3,Too much remix.,"I like the first and last couple of songs. The rest are too ""remix"" for me, but I guess all the series are like this because it happens to me with the Latin Travels as well. Is interesting, thought."
3,"What exactly is ""Asian""?","I like the music on this CD and other Six Degrees compilations a lot.But like the catchphrases ""Asian underground"" and ""Asian massive,"" the title ""Asian Travelers"" is very misleading. The only Asian influences heard on this CD and indeed in much of what is called ""Asian"" in the UK is from India and/or India's immediate neighbours.Hey the last time I looked there was a lot more to Asia, both culturally and geographically, then just the Indian Subcontinent. I think it's a safe bet that the folks in Japan, China, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia -- all of whom have their own musical traditions -- resent having 'Asian' nomenclature stop dead in its tracks at the eastern border of India.Karsh Kale is an incredible talent, and having chatted with the man in NYC, I believe he'd be the first to decry this use of 'Asian' as a descripter. Only in the UK is 'Asian' used in this manner.Good music, but I take off two stars for nationalistic (or is it merely ignorant?) marketing."
2,Best of Trance Rewiew,Unfortunately I have to agree that this compilation is outdated. A lot of these so called trance tracks are more mainstream euro-pop than Trance. If you really want to listen to some awesome trance then take a look at the Trancemaster compilations. Full length tracks that reflect the true essence of today's trance music.
1,Trance??,"I have no idea how this Comp. is supposed to be Trance. This is a far cry from Trance, even house style. Listen to the sound clips before you buy. Its just plain ole tired house music. If you are looking for House with more a ""Techno"" feel, so to say, then try the Webster Hall ""Tranzworld"" Series. I believe a box set is avaiable for the series. Even though it starts at the mid 90's, and works its way up through the years, its still a great comp. and house music really hasnt changed a hullva lot since that time period. (at least I dont hear much diffrence expect it has seem to get more ""poppy"""
2,NOT AS NICE AS THE PICTURES!,"I saw the pictures of this and fell in love, thinking the fabric wouldbe kind of shiny, and the fit snug and cute. Ordered in it purple and olive in large. Although it's not ugly, it just looks very plain,and looks like any plain old colored wife beater you could buy at walmart. Not bad but definitely the pictures were deceptive and they're just so plain, and stretch out and provide an unflattering fit. What a letdown."
1,The pictures do not represent the real product!!!,"These tanks look nothing like the picture. On my screen they have a ""velvety"" look to them ( at least the black and olive colors do ) which was a bit unusual and why I ordered in the first place. I received them ( I thought they were so cool, I ordered 2 ) earlier than expected but am very disappointed. They are very thin and cheap, not even worth the postage sending them back ;(Update: June 8th. After 3 washes, the black one has 3 small holes in the front. grrrrrrrrrrrr. Not sure why everyone else is raving about these crap tank tops!!!"
1,BEYOND TIGHT,SIZE SMALL IN THIS TANK WOULD BE TIGHT ON MY FORTY POUND GRAND DAUGHTER. SAD AS FINDING 100% COTTON SHIRTS IS DIFFICULT. GUESS I'LL CUT THE SLEEVES OFF OF T-SHIRTS AND MAKE DO.
2,Simpleminded Premise,"The premise is that Las Vegas is a microcosm of the greed, corruption and exploitation that is the United States of America. This simpleminded and essentially anti-American theme explains the rave reviews from the New York Times and other left-wing papers. Anti-Mormom sentiment is overt. The authors also cram in way too much information as they stretch to support their theory. The type is annoyingly small."
1,Paranoia Strikes Deep,While many authors tend to overlook the criminal influence in Las Vegas and view the known criminals as a group of Damon Runyon characters these authors go to the other extreme. Every problem and political scandal in the United States today is traced backed to Las Vegas in their view. I hate to admit it but the book was so boring that I couldn't finish it. If you are looking for the worst this book may be for you but if you want an even handed approach look somewhere else.
1,Complete Fiction,"Although the title sounds tempting, it is a waste of money and time to read this book-- glorified gossip is more like it. Sally Denton and the publishers should be ashamed to claim that it is ""Based on five years of intensive research and interviewing""."
4,Magisterial,"Denton and Powers open up Las Vegas like a clam. I said to my wife, while reading this book, ""It's startling"", she said, ""I can imagine"" and I had to reply, ""No you can't"". I guess I expected exposes of sleaze, but sleaze (in the conventional sense of back-room oral sex, or whatever) is just background noise. The real sleaze is the tightly integrated relationship between organised crime and ""straight"" society, described in a deadpan style that makes the hand-in-pocket relationship between mobsters and pols seem completely ordinary - as, indeed, it is in Las Vegas's history. The overriding theme - that America - or, if you prefer, modern society - is at least as corrupt as Vegas and that Vegas may be an honest admission of that corruption in some strange way, is made with finesse. Only some leaden writing, from time to time, stops this from beiung a 5* review."
4,Excellent read,"A lot has changed in Las Vegas since this book was first published, but that doesn't change the fact that is remains a stunning read. Learn a little bit about the corruption that created America's playground, the hack ""journalist"" who started--what is now a media empire in the city--a newspaper to coerce politicians and land developers, and all the shady politics that involve a number of names you will recognize from today's ""corporate"" Las Vegas."
5,truth sets free,Read this book. Truth does set free. Seems 'conspiratorial' .. but the 'ring' of truth is there throughout .. if one has ears to listen for it.
2,Bland - lacking inspiration or vision.,"much too ""textbook"" for me. I struggled through the first chapter and gave up. I was looking for a resource to guide our church through the foundational aspects of small groups. Arnold takes 20 pages to communicate what should fill 3."
2,Much Overrated,"I'm afraid that this book is much overrated. Miller claims to expose all sorts of intimate details of Foucault's life for which he has no actual evidence--only his own imagination and a loose construction of the context--and then bases his biography on those constructs. In the end he does little do illuminate the late Foucault, doesn't engage with any of the lectures which are being translated these days (and which were available in taped form much earlier) and consequently fails to extend to his subject what most biographers would expect for themselves--a serious engagement with the life and thought."
2,Lets Get Real about this Biography,"I give 2 stars because Miller is uncritical and his premise is excellent, looking at Foucault's life as a Nietzean exercise, but his execution of it is rather clunky. 1)His interpretation is overdetermined. Reading this biography flattens Foucault's works into being about the same thing. Foucault, in Miller's hands, appear to never have had shifts in his thinking. 2)Reader beware! Miller quotes Foucault out of context. One will always have to compare Miller's quotes against the original. 3) He overpersonalizes the philospher failing to provide a context of which Foucault's ideas had arisen. If you want a well-balanced biography try David Macey. Macey respects the reader's intelligence, he allows us to decide for ourselves unlike, Miller who imposes his interpretation on us."
2,Too general,Great topic but this book is full of supposition and not much that we haven't read a hundred times before. Very general overview with not a lot of interesting facts.
5,Everyabody Hates Chris - The Frist Season - AWESOME!!!,I purchased the First Season of Everybody Hates Chris for my 13 year old son. He ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS SHOW and has watched the DVD's over and over. He can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out on DVD.
4,Great new baby gift!,This is a sweet book with a simple rhyming text. It expresses in just a few words how many parents feel about their children and makes a great new baby gift. It is sure to bring a tear to any new mother's eye!
3,Eh.,"This book is for parents, not for children. It is excessively sentimental, and while the illustrations are pretty, they bear little relationship to the content. The words don't rhyme, scan, or have a strong rhythm, and the vocabulary is not aimed at young children.It's sweet, but does not hold a candle to ""I Love You Forever""."
5,"A warm, touching rhyme.","My two-year old daughter loves this book. When I read it to her now, she recites it along with me, and it just fills me up. I dare you to read it aloud the first number of times without a catchy voice."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.,"This band has great talent but the album was totaly flat their intent is noticable but not felt,the musical arrangement was horrible and i was REALLY LET DOWN,especially for the price i paid i would have been better spending it on any other album. I give them 1 star for effort but thats about all they will get out of me.I expected alot more especially since they talked about the ""OLD SCHOOL SALSA FEEL"" it felt alot like reggeaton beat...the same beat over and over and over."
2,Don't be fooled!,"This collection is not worth the price because firstly, the songs are all re-recorded versions and secondly some of his bigger hits are not included. It is quite surprising that until now no definitive collection of all his hits (originals) have been issued by his record label."
4,good tire for the price,"So i was working on a bike project and wanted a 24 x 3.0 tire and took a chance on these to keep the cost down. the side walls are really thin and came kind of wrinkly before they were inflated. we'll see how they hold up but the thin sidewalls also means they weigh less than my thickbricks. also not all 3.0s are created equal and these are actually 2 7/8 mounted on a 2"" rim and 2 5/8 on 1.75 rim that could be a good thing if clearance is a concern. they are a cheaper tire but worth going with from my point of view especially for mockups or bikes with clearance issues"
2,"One Anthem, One Kiss-alike Song, One Cover","Back in the day, I gladly threw my fist in the air and banged my head whenever The Right to Rock came on MTV. From what I recall from that time, Keel's whole career was built around that single, and for a good reason: the rest of this album is the very definition of metal filler, with the possible exceptions of Easier Said than Done, which sounds like a tamer version of Kiss's Lick it Up and Let's Spend the Night Together, which is a Rolling Stones Cover. Good 'ol Ron Keel at least knew that hair metal's selling point was catchy songwriting, and seeing that his band was sorely lacking in that department he would ultimately ditch the genre and go country years later. For hair metal completists only, or people like me that must own a physical copy of The Right to Rock, arguably one of hair metal's biggest anthems."
2,Anybody want a headache?,"The headache you get the first time you hear this is the good ""kick smash yell and start fights"" kind, but halfway through the second spin you'll be ready to toss this one out. Ron Keel sounds like he is HURTING himself the way he sings! The guitars sound like construction equipment. There's a similar sensation to cracking your head on a brick wall in hearing this album. The number of stars we give it equal the number of stars you see circling your head. It's painful. That's the point tho. I think that makes it ""better"" than todays death metal. It is it's own worst enemy"
4,"Good, but not his best","This is a good album, taking some songs from the classic Lay down the law album. Lay down the law was less polished, yes, but it rocked much harder than anything Keel ever put out after it."
4,The right to Rock still,This album lived on my turntable back in the day the year that it came out. The Right to Rock is one of the better anthems from this era. It does not surpirse me that Gene Simmons had a hand in producing this album. It has the same general makeup of a Kiss Album. It has some good riffs and catchy lyrics. Keel coulda been a contenda.
4,Excellent,"Excellent case. When I first got the case, it was so stiff I could not get even 1/2 of the base into the sleeve. The top half was even stiffer. However, after a day of some stretching under a hot light bulb I was able to slide the phone right into both half's of the case... Only minus to this case is the way the top snaps to the base sleeve - it snaps from the inside causing the tip of the ""flap"" to stick out and always catching of things - like chair backs and coat liners. All in all an excellent case. Probably the best case I've bought yet. Since I'm hard on my cases and like them to look good, I'm sure I'll be buying this one again!"
2,The Song by Boy George is Better!,"I'm still struggling through this tedious novel, which does have its good points, but my impression so far has been: WHERE ARE THE EDITORS??? This book contains POV shifts in the middle of scenes, vague descriptions, redundancies and the author's terrible habit of using ""and"" 3-5 times in one sentence! The most annoying thing about the novel, however, is the way he introduces characters in disconnected scenes and gets us acquainted with them only to kill them off! Gets so I don't want to know them and I can't keep them straight. I will give him credit for his action and sex scenes. These are tight and well-written. He has done extensive research and his writing has an authentic ring to it, be it about explosives, arctic oil rigs or Italian race car drivers."
4,Does their job well,"What can you say about a set of skewers? They were chosen based on a Cook's Illustrated review: they're reasonably sharp-pointed to penetrate well, they're 12 inches long to be very useful, they're sturdy, and they're flat so food won't rotate. All I to do was research more the best price"
4,Good quality,"These skeweres are very good quality and I expect them to last a long time and because they are flat the veggies turn with the skewers. However, I do wish the loops on the end were a little bigger because it is hard to grab them with tongs to turn them but using a glove solves this."
4,Nice and lightweight. Ridges sometimes trap food.,"I like this pan for stir fry and various other uses. It's very lightweight and the non-stick surface is good. The only complaint I have is that there are ridges on the inside of the pan around the edges that certain foods can get trapped in while cooking, like scrambled eggs. But, for typical stir fry meals I think this is a good choice. The inside is quite deep and holds a lot."
4,A really good pan for sauteeing,"In a New York kitchen, this stir fry pan can do multiple duty: I have used it as a wok (not perfect, but a creditable performance), as a skillet for steak (worked surprisingly well), for vegetables, even to steam rice. The non-stick coating is great, although it is a pity that cleaning it in the dishwasher is not recommended. That said,nothing sticks, so everytHing rinses off easily by hand.Very happy I bought it!"
3,Delicious,Tastes good. I only ordered one bottle and it recommends that you take the product for a minimum of 2 months. I didn't notice feeling any differently because of taking it but I finished it in a week or so I think. So you would need to buy 8 bottles. But from my research I know its good for your body so it definately didnt hurt. It may have helped me internally but I just dont know it yet.
5,Covers it,"This covers everything you need to take on your big notion of becoming an aviation artist. It will also serve you well for an understanding or perspective of objects in space, and to make the good compositional decisions. It was very inexpensive, and I was very surprised and pleased with what I got for so little. Now, to become rich and famous from my aviation art."
4,Reglo Maxi Super wide Walk thru Gate,"I purchased this Gate to Keep our Young, wild Great Dane out of our Family Room and off our new furniture:) I searched several different styles of gates, and keep coming back to this one. Mainly because the price seemed to be the best deal I could find for an extra wide gate. I ended up getting this one that actually screws into the wall because I heard that the other kind, when you tighten it against the wall, was then hard to open the door on the walk through part of the gate.When I recieved it, my first thought was that it looked cheap. I did want something that would look like a total eye sore since it's going to be there for a while, but it is doing the job so far. My boys ages 9 and 3 can both use the gate with no complications, they both can open and close the door of the gate without any assistance.Overall a good purchase.Amazon.com has the best deals."
1,Not a Pressure Mounted Gate,This gate isn't a pressure mount. It's definitely not portable. It pressure mounts onto plastic things that you SCREW into the doorway. No thanks. I'm disappointed that it was misrepresented in the description and I'll be sending it back.
2,Deceptive advertising,"I was looking for a pressure-mounted extra wide gate, and came across this product and thought it fit the bill by reading the product description. The description reads as follows: ""This features pressure mounts for easy set up and take down around the house and on the road."" The utility of the product might be okay, but I had an issue with its advertising. This product DOES NOT pressure mount. It needs hardware to be installed to the walls. If the manufacturer just wrote that it needs screws to mount, it would have saved me the two week hassle to get the one that I truly was looking for."
1,If I could rate 0 stars I would,Our opening is 46 definitely does not fit! either fits the minimum width or the max. In the middle the door opening feature is useless because part of the extension is in the way. Sending it back tomorrow to get something else.
3,"Sturdy, awkward opening","It seems like a fairly sturdy gate, we bought it to keep our 80 lb dog out of the kitchen. I don't care for the latch of the gate and the gate opening is narrow."
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this gate because I run a home daycare and I have an extra-wide doorway that I need to close off. The gate quality is really good but the latch and lock system is terrible. I have children that are year and a half old and they figured out how to unlock and open the gate about a week after I installed it. So unless you plan on using it for pets I would not waste the money on this one.
2,Company didn't think design through,"Had to align it just right, otherwise the gate doesn't shut. Torn right out of walls several times. Doesn't take into account height of baseboards, have a book wedged underneath the middle to support gates."
1,Easily Broken,"We were so happy with this gate which worked well for nearly 5 months. Then yesterday, the entire metal bottom of the gate snapped in half. The warranty is only 90 days and they didn't have a part they could ship to fix it. The only option is to buy a brand new gate. I'm not going to do that just to have it break again. So irritating and a huge waste of money. I'll add a picture later."
1,Terrible Gate,This gate is so poorly built it is not even funny!!! Don't waste your time on this gate!! I am so glad we returned ours.
2,Ok for the price....,"I rated this 2 stars, if says three stars I dont know why, anyway Seems fairly sturdy, good for the price, BUT the things I HATE about it is you have to screw brackets into the wall to secure it, the gate installed sits an inch off the floor so there's a bar you have to step over when you walk through it(Huge Trip Hazard), it's NOT a space saver if you choose not to have the gate up, the latch on the gate is kinda child proof, the release slides to the side to open latch i do and do not like that, and the gate only opens one way! SO its not a bad gate but not a great gate, you get what you pay for and Im glad I didnt pay anymore than I did for this and it's serving its purpose But in the future I will pay more for a better gate."
2,"Does not fit all openings between 38"" and 60""","Although the instruction manual claims, ""This gate can be used in openings from 38 to 60 inches,"" there is a window between 40 and 45 inches where the gate cannot be made to work. Using only the main gate (without extension) it will span up to 40"" and the gate with extension can only be shortened to 45"", leaving the gap between 40 and 45 inches, which happened to be the opening I wanted to span.In addition, I didn't like that it would only swing one way; also, the latching mechanism seemed cumbersome. It's probably a good gate if you have a very wide opening, but otherwise, stick with something else. The two stars are because the product was not as advertised."
2,Not what was expected,"1) Gate did not reach 59 inches because that is what I needed EXACTLY.2) Gate was also bent during shipping and it was a pain in the rear just to try to bend it back3) Door opening was very small and narrow, so if you're a fatty, don't come throughI would have given it 4 stars if it fit 59 inches. Either I was sent the wrong one, I don't know. All I know is that I spend a LOT of money on Amazon.com, too much to have this mistake. And it's such a hassle to have to return items because I work so many hours a week that I literally work USPS/UPS hours and more so I literally have to lose money by taking time off work to return it. Thats why I do all my shopping online."
2,"Would not fit our 48"" door opening","I bought this gate to fit in a 48"" doorway, but we could not adjust it to fit. Other than not fitting, it seemed like a nice enough gate, although it was not very tall. I was a little concerned my active 2 year old would try to climb on top of it, but we could never install it, so I don't know if that would have been a problem or not. I think if you had a larger door opening or a smaller one, it might have fit."
3,good - not great,"not a great product. it does fit the opening fine and the installation was easy. my only complaint is the chintzy plastic wall connectors. a 2 year old walked across the floor bar yesterday and the 4-cent plastic wall clip snapped (i.e. the bottom side is no longer attached). They shouldn't advertise all metal construction, and then supply cheap pieces of plastic for the actual connection."
1,Protrusion!,"My hallway opening is about 44.5"" which falls between the claimed 37-59"" capabilities of the product. However the provided extension leaves 5 inches of itself protruding into the pass-through, just waiting to snag something or someone. Only option is to take a hack saw to it or return it."
3,not as great as it seems,"The gate seems flimsy, the installation hardware that it comes with is not the best. We had quite a time getting it to feel ""secure"" in the wall. However, this is one of the only ones like it on the market and it does fit our need."
3,too easy to open,My three year old figured out how to open this in about two seconds. It holds my 1 1/2 year old twins back (but not the three year old). I guess this might be good till they are about two. Then you will have to lock it with an additional lock (what I do).
3,Nice Picture,"Wanted to upgrade the appearance of my files w/a lided hanging file. They do what they are suppposed to do, however, the workman ship--misshapened lid that doesn't quite fit & several broken wicker stubbs--disappointing. Not as elegant as the display & the hang bars needed waxing so files will slide."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Flimsy, doesn't fit well, way over priced.... We ordered 2 on the same day at the exact same time and they are different colors from each other. To boot, we have to pay for shipping and handling back so it actually cost us money. NOT A GOOD BUY NOR PRODUCT."
4,Perfect File Storage Solution,This basket really fits the bill. I have a very small home office and did not have the space for a filing cabinet. This wicker basket with the built-in hangers for hanging files is just right! The wicker around edge was a tad brittle and some pieces (nothing major) broke off. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. Other than that it is a good value!
1,Not happy with quality,"I love the natural look of wicker. These boxes had pieces sticking out randomly and the paint job appeared chipped. If I had seen the boxes in a store, I would not have paid $40 each for them. Please note, the boxes were not damaged in transit...they are just poor quality.Buyer beware, you are responsible for shipping the items back to the vendor. When I went to return the items, I discovered shipping to California is very expensive...anywhere from $32 to over $100. Needless to say, I kept the boxes because it was more money down the drain to return.Lessons learned, review the return policy! There are many alternatives out there and I should have chosen one with a better return policy in a state that is cheap to ship to. I was told by the very nice man in the package store that next to Hawaii and Alaska, California and Texas are the two most expensive states to ship to."
1,Wicker breaking as soon as it arrived,"I'm amazed that someone would say the wicker around the edge was ""a tad brittle, and some pieces broke off"" and then give the product four stars! The fact that pieces are already breaking off when the box is brand new might be a clue that it's of inferior quality. The broken off pieces of wicker make the box actually dangerous--you can scratch or cut yourself if you aren't extremely careful hanging files in it. The best I can say is that it looks nice."
1,Great information,"This book is great. Golly Gee whiz I love it. It is awesome. Can't wait to tell mom that I found a whole book about WEED. Cool huh? This book is totally cool and mind-blowing, especially with all the cool pictures. Dude. Sweet."
2,Looks good but watch out...,"Nice design, that's about it. Not only is this desktop poorly designed but it also does not seem to like certain software/hardware combinations; coupled with the buggy windows XP pro, this machine will reboot frequently without warning...watch for HP spywares as wellGo check Dell or Sony first. I am returning mine."
2,Suitability for Scouts,"This book is well suited for young auidences. Grades 1-4 will probably find this a good resource on Native American pastimes. I bought this for my district scout library. It seems to be well suited for the Tigers and Wolf scouts, but a bit young in style for bears onwards. this has surprised me slightly. Wellw ritten and plenty of photographs"
1,which?,how can i review the book if i have not one? i thought i was conducting me to be eligible for receiving an evaluation copy or so...
2,"Great music, lousy singer","It is a tragedy to have a band perform so well, only to be eclipsed by Gord's ranting and barking which essentially ruins most every song. I couldn't help but think of him as the kid in class who acts up to get attention. I've never been a fan of singers who feel they need to add commentary -- but this takes it to the extreme. Get some respect and chill a bit, let the band shine sometime and give a rest from distracting rants which feel forced. It's really unfortunate."
5,Classic Hip,"Terrific concert, great video/audio quality. I especially love the approach the filmmakers took in trying to really capture the experience of being there. They leave in the standing ovations, the cheering and the pauses between encores. It's one concert (not pieced together from different shows) and it runs in real time. It really captures the energy and vitality of the band and the audience. It's really very exciting. I felt like I was there! Spectacular work all around!"
5,Great high-energy concert!!,"Finally a concert DVD by this band! No gimmicks, just great music and an inspired performance. Gord rants - but that is what he does. I highly recommend the DVD."
2,Don't lose the software!,"This camera is a great little ""pic on the fly"" type camera. If you're a person who actually composes photos, or have an artistic streak, don't waste your time and money. However, it is a good little camera for spur of the moment image capturing. The worst thing about it is that THERE IS NOWHERE TO FIND THE DRIVER if you lose or damage the accompanying CD. If there's someone out there that cam make it available online please do so."
4,Circulon Pasta Cooker,"We Purchased this product to replace a larger Circulon pot whose non-stick coating had failed and because it had the locking lid. The first one we received had a cracked handle and the lid wouldn't fit properly, probably damaged in shipping. As is the case with Amazon they immediately replaced the product and it arrived the following day. We have used it several times since receiving it and we love the versatility of uses, we cook pasta, and have used it as a wok, it heats very quickly and maintains high temperature with less fire. It works as advertised and we enjoy using it. I would have given it 5 stars, but the circular pattern in the pot makes for a little harder job of cleaning food residue.Incidentally, I shipped the defective product to Circulon and they honored the warranty for the failed coating. I did include pictures of other pieces of product that didn't have the same problem, I'm sure that helped."
3,Don't count on 'Jokes',"As the previous reviewer mentioned, mine arrived a little beaten up. The 1st can wasn't too bad, but there were a fair number of unreadable chips (due to shipment damage). I'll wait and see how more of the cans turn out before getting a refund from Amazon.Also beware that the image shows 'Jokes' as the prints, however, mine were music trivia - something I wasn't really interested in. Now I have 14 cans of trivia to get through :("
5,LOVE IT!,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I'VE PURCHASED, THE JEANS ARE NICE. I WILL BUY FROM HERE AGAIN AND AGAIN, I WISH THE SHIPPING WAS FASTER BUT BESIDES THAT I AM VERY SATISFIED!!!"
4,Excitement in an Exotic Land: DJAKARTA,"Daren Lamb uses the exotic island of Java as background for likeable characters to meet danger and excitement. The story abounds in hairbreadth escapes and warm moments of deep emotion. Djakarta comes alive with all its sensual flavors. The author clearly knows Indonesia well. Some pages left me feeling the heavy, humid heat of the island, and actually wanting a tall, cool drink! As a professor specializing in Southeast Asia, I have lived and worked in Java. I recommend DJAKARTA to both enjoy and learn about Indonesia."
2,"all in all, it is a good book",This book is very useful for special situations or special places. It is a lexical and has many words in it with exact meaning.It is not so useful for specific words that we would look for as we would do in a dictionary.The only inconvenient of this book is that the words contained in this book are not all of them at the lexical of the end.
4,"Sturdy, fun toy","We've had this cooktop for seven years with two kids and it has been great. It sets up anywhere, is sturdy, and adds a fun element to pretend play with food. The materials have stood up to a great deal of abuse and still look great. The cooktop has been set up in every room of my house, on tables, chairs, counters, even on the floor with a box or block to prop up the backside. The only detraction for both of my children is that the knobs simply twirl; if they had any ability to click into place the kids would find it more satisfactory."
3,ADHD as subject matter,"This book is concise and easy to understand for the layman, yet in-depth for the professional. The diversity of the contributors, and their differing opinions on treatment is interesting and rewarding reading."
1,Disappointed,"We were soo excited to give this to our girls for Christmas.My husband decided to put it together the night before and instantly ran into many problems. The prodict did not come with some of the hardware that it needed to be built. The pre-drilled holes in the boards were in the wrong place, NOT drilled at all or on the wrong side!! On every piece of wood there was a smudge of slightly different color paint on it to hide some scratch I guess-did not look good. We were so completely disappointed in every way and had to return it because even if we decided to keep it we couldn't put it together based on the above mistakes."
3,What no ADO??!!!,"I have not read this book. I would not buy it as it does not(apparently) cover database access with ADO ...which I would have thought would now be the prefered method? Having said that, the other methods probably work just fine."
5,3 stone moonstone earrings,"my wife saw these and wanted them. i ordered them they arrived quickly, the product was as shown and described in the posting. the price was great and above all my wife loves them, she even wears them to walk around the house. thanks, it was great doing business"
4,3-Stone Drop Earrings,"The Rainbow Moonstone Earrings with 3 stones are lovely, delicate and feminine-looking. I would definitely buy these for my friends who like moonstones."
5,Papal Coronation,"John Paul II, the philosopher pope, is the most intriguing thinker of our time. But it's not easy to plow through the mass of encyclicals, adresseses, and books. This work provides an excellent study of the Pope's thought. Special kudos to John Crosby for showing the phenomenological side of the pope and to Joseph Koterski for unraveling the Thomist side."
4,Helpful International School Resource,"Literary critiques aside, this book is one I highly recommend to teachers and parents who are looking for help with preparing kids for a new student. Teachers in international schools or deal with ""new students"" all the time. This is a great book to read before the new student arrives and as a ""reminder"" after. As for the comment about the teacher - for some insulting; for others reflective material."
3,The Brand New Kid,"This is a book about The brand new kid. There is a kid named Lazlo how moved here from a different country with his mother. He joined mrs.Mcsnelly's class at brookhaven Elementary school. He is not very pleased, he doesn't fit in then a nice girl named Ellie came to his locker."
4,the Brand New Kid,"The Brand New Kid by Katie Couric is about a kid from a foreign country and joined Mrs.Kincaid second grade class at Brookhaven Elementary Schools. This kid's name is Lazlo who didn't quite fit in. The kids in his own class and everyone in the whole class made fun of him and pulled terrible pranks on him, until a girl named Ellie said the unsaidable!I give this book 4 out of 5 paws because this book tells exactly what happens to new kids who don't quite fit in."
4,What A Wonderful Idea,"Can't wait for my 8 y/o to read this book. I hope that she learns that because you are different or a new person that you should not treat anyone the way that she would not want to be treated. What a great ideal for Katie's first book, and to also use her daughters names."
1,Pathetic excuse for a book,"How sad that some readers actually feel this ""book"" has any literary merit whatsoever. Apparently people are more concerned with the moral of a story than with the story itself. When did childrens' books become medicine? And where, may I ask, was the editor while this book was being produced? Oh, wait, now I remember. It really doesn't matter if the book is good or not. When the author is on the Today Show every morning plugging her book, who cares what the content is? Shame on Doubleday for publishing such a poorly written, didactic book."
1,Cliche and lame,"""Too different and strange to fit in they all feared."" Thank god the kid wasn't black or Asian."
3,"OK, BUT WHO IS SICK OF KATIE COURIC","KATIE COURIC IS THE KATHY LEE GIFFORD FOR THE NEW MILLENIUM, BUT OVERALL THE BOOK HAS SOME GOOD LESSONS FOR KIDS. WHAT'S NEXT KATIE? A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL?"
2,Doesn't Work as a Read-Aloud,"I agree with the reader from Amherst that the rhymes in this book are VERY clunky. I bought it for the charming illustrations and for the theme (I'm currently working on a lesson plan about acceptance, diversity, etc.). However, I regret buying it, because it's extremely difficult to read out loud. The rhymes are awkward, and the inconsistent metre ruins any sense of flow.There are plenty of high quality children's books that deal with this theme. Take a pass on this one, and try Wolf! by Sara Fanelli, or Something Else by Kathryn Cave and Chris Riddell. Both of these books have talented illustrators AND writers."
1,Better Luck Next Time,"I like Katie Couric on the""Today Show"", I like the fact that some of the proceeds are going to charity, I like putting out the message of tolerance - what I don't like however is this book.The writng is mediocre at best. If someone else's name was on the cover I seriously doubt it would have ever been published. There are far better children's books with messages that are just as valuable only they have talented authors who wrote them. Hopefully, Katie can do better on her next book (yes, she is writing another one). Oh, there is one more thing that I like - the fact that I didn't have to pay for it, my daughter got it as a gift."
2,"Beautiful, Vibrant Pictures, but Couric Can't Write!","As usual, Marjorie Priceman's illustations are divine: colorful, energetic, and stylish. But who told Katie Couric she can write? The rhymes are incredibly clunky! Just try reading this aloud:""He's terrific at chess, and his Mom's really sweet.Playing soccer the guy doesn't have two left feet.""Couric's heart is in the right place, but the story would have been better if she had written it in prose rather than forced rhyme."
1,Authors don't write books today,"Katie is a media star and certainly not a writer.Seems that we, American public are not able to decidewhat is news nor characteristics we would want for our children?Sometimes, I think I am alone in thinking for myself because""beautiful people"" like Katie Couric stoop to nothingto further their own popularity. Rhyming and writingcan be so important to all of us especially as a learning toolfor youth and this book is a disappointment. Not worth my time.."
3,The Brand New Kid,The Brand New Kid is about a boy named Lazlo who moved from another country and joined Mrs. McSnellys second grade class at Brookhaven Elementry school until he wasn't happy because he didn't fit in with all the other kids . Until finally a girl named Ellie came to his locker and asked him to play.I think This book is a good book because it's not and it's not boringand you should read it when your board.
1,Awful!,"I read this book while at the Children's Library yesterday and I was shocked! All the kids are so mean to the new kid and it seems that the teacher allows it. The girl is only nice to him once she feels sorry for him. How about writing a book where the kids are accepting from the beginning to show how kids are supposed to act! Please do not buy this book for your children. If you do, I think you will be extremely disappointed. Shame on you, Katie, for putting something like this out there for kids to read!"
4,Read This Ms. P.,"The Brand New Kid by Katie Couric4 pawsThe genre of The Brand New Kid by Katie Couric is realistic fiction. It's realistic fiction because it charactorizes a way a student might feel when they first move to a new school. Poor diminutive Lazlo gets teased and taunted by all of the 2nd graders. No one dares talk to ""Lazlo the wierdo"". Then a sweet girl does something nobody expects.This story shows what new kids are going through. Even if they seem weird at first, they could be nice people. It helps kids underside what it's like to go to a new school."
1,Katie's Vanity Project,This amateurish effort from Ms. Couric should never have been published. The writing is bland and the rhythm forced. Buy a book from a professional children's author who has spent serious time honing their craft.
2,Well Intentioned But Not Well Written,"I was greatly disappointed in this book. The rhymes are forced and awkward - I had to read one page to my son several times and it still didn't have any flow. One review suggests that we shoud give Katie a break because her heart was in the right place. Well I disagree. A book should stand or fall on its own merits, not because of whose name is on the cover. If she is truly concerned about putting the message of tolerance out, why doesn't she become a patron to a young author with some real talent. I'm afraid this is just another example of a celebrity who thinks they can write. 2 stars for the illustrations."
3,Close But No Cigar,"I recently read this book thinking that it might be good for my son to read. He was adopted from eastern Europe and is of gypsy descent. I felt that it might ease some of his fears about not fitting in. However as I got into the book I realized that the lead character was ostracized because he was too light skinned and too blond! Obviously the book was intended to address the issue of tolerance in general - but my son would not have gotten past the race issue. I think she should think about that in her next book. Additionally, I felt some of the rhymes a bit too forced and contrived. Although some of the proceeds go to charity (why not all?) I can think of better books at a more reasonable price."
2,Misses The Mark,"This writing in this book is energetic but uneven. While well-intentioned, its forced rhyme and missing meter fall short. The illustrations however are quite nice."
2,The Brand New Kid By: Katie Courie,"The Brand New Kid is a book about a boy named lazlo who moved from another country. He wasnt very excited about joining Miss Kincaid's class because he knew he didn't fit in. But all that would change when a girl visited him at his locker.A real ""Z counter""The book would be interesting if you were a first grader but it has a very typical new kid plot."
5,Night Game is terror on a rampage!,"Author Carol Davis Luce will take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and leave you shaken and breathless. And when the book finally shudders to a halt and you're on solid ground again, you will be haunted by scintillating Reno nights, the secrets of the dealers, and a memorable character: Kasey Atwood, whose dangerous undercover work leads her to love, betrayal, and murder"
4,A Good Read,"I don't believe in synopsizing the novel in my reviews & wish other reviewers would observe the same, the blurb does that for you. I also don't believe in commenting on the price of a novel. I just want to give you my findings on the novel.I've just finished this novel & I thoroughly enjoyed it. Things I like in a novel - the author tells you something & then repeats it further into the novel (love that - I don't have to go back looking for the info), all the loose ends get tied up & the pace is good. I got this in this novel. I really would have given it 5 stars but for the bad punctuation, ie, full stops where it should have been a coma and some bad ?typing, eg, comer rather than corner & no, my eyes didn't deceive me cos I put the cursor on the word & the dictionary gave me the meaning of 'comer'!! That said, I enjoyed the read & I think I'll read some more of this lady."
3,Numbers must bewilder the author,"Good story, well paced. However, I found the lack of research when it comes to numbers very annoying. A 12 story hotel/casino of 49,000 sq ft (p. 86, loc. 1540)? With 25,000 employees (loc. 1520)? Another hotel described as having 2,000 rooms in 100,000 sq ft (loc. 1952)? A little common sense, please - that's 50 sq ft per room with no hallways, lobby or anything! Must be like the TARDIS - bigger on the inside. A very picky complaint, true, but the serious lack of association with reality is a sign of sloppiness. That said, it's well worth the 99 cents if you skip the dimensional silliness."
4,Great Read,"I really enjoyed reading this book as I have the other 2 Carol Davis Luce books I've read. Personally I liked Night Prey the best, followed by Night Stalker and then this one. The only let down on this one was the ending. Other than that it had edge of your seat action and a great story line with believable characters."
2,too long and got boring,This book dragged on and on. Would have been ok in 50 pages. I wanted to staquit entirely midway but i painfully finished it. I don't recommend sorry.
2,Fails to Provide All Advertised Features,"MPEG4 video does NOT work, and after two attempts plus a week of waiting, the manufacturer's technical support has no idea how to make it work.I asked specifically about what video format to code and which ISO version to burn. The only thing they could tell me is that DivX4 & XviD specifically won't work, but they have no idea what MP4 formats >will< work.The reason why this rates two stars instead of one is the price that I found ($70), burned DVDs >do< work (all DVD +/-RW that I tried), and as an added (unadvertised) bonus, it will read both NTSC and PAL video.As a side note, the A/V input cable is (to my knowledge) non-standard, using a single, three-wire 3.5mm mini-plug. By contrast, I also have an older (1st generation) portable DVD where the A/V cable split into two 3.5mm mini-plugs (a two-wire standard audio and a single-wire video) which allowed (now) standard cables to be used as replacements in case the included cable was lost or destroyed."
4,a must have,"For a chilly/windy winter in NJ, this item is a must have for all Joovy owners. Kids feel warmer inside with this cover and I can even take them to walk when it is sunny (temp: 50F). The reason I do not give it a five star is because of pricing. It will be nice if joovy would include this in the original packing or charge it at a lower price tag."
3,Not really what we wanted!!,"Other reviews lead me to think that this would work VERY well on our Baby Trend Stroller (and it works...just not VERY well). We got it to go to Disney World (we have not gone yet, but tried it at home). It will do the job that we want it to. I will say for the money it is a very good value, put togather well and the cover its self seems to be of very high quality."
5,Love these........,"I love, love, love these sesame bars......I'm gluten free and they are such a nice treat."
4,Tasty snack 23% sesame seeds!,"These bars are a tasty snack.They are very similar to the ""sasame snap"" bars exept made with rice and date syrup instead.My only ""issues"" with these is they have 23% sesame seeds, so in a 50 aprox gram bar that is around 12 grams sesame seeds and really not much- these are mainly made of the rice syrup and also stick to your teeth well.Still, I will buy these again as I do like the taste and they are more ""natural"" than other bars. Also made in the US :)"
4,It's a Hat,"Hard to a review a hat--it was exactly as ordered--New ERA 59FIFTY hats are of course of the highest quality, and it is an excellent hat. Delivery was fast, and on-time."
1,Size was not printed correct,"The size of hat was not right. I order 7 5/8 but the hat is much bigger like an 8, must be a defect that you are selling."
1,Don't Trust This Title,"As advertised on the cover of this book, anachronistic me-generation guru Peck and his wife Lily set off on a tour of Britain's legendary stone circles, right? Wrong. Peck and Lily do visit some circle sites but this book is about 1% stone circles and 99% Peck going on and on and on and on and on and on about himself, his life, his beliefs, his personal health, and why faithful Lily forgave him for all the pain his freewheeling, skirtchasing lifestyle as one of the ""it"" crowd of the '60's and '70's self-discovery movement caused her. This is not about Britain's heritage sites, or even about self-help, it's about Peck patting Peck on the back for being such a smart fella. A bad book without any redeeming qualities. A waste of money and time. Oh, and Dr. Peck, Scotland is not, as you claim, ""larger than all the rest of the United Kingdom combined."" Jeesh."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"Having read a couple of Dr Peck's other books, I bought this one hoping to find the best of all worlds (travel, archaeology, religion, and spirituality). I was disappointed on all counts. The 'stones' part was a rapid-fire description of site after site. Because very little is known about the history behind these stones or the people who constructed them, the book becomes a somewhat thinly disguised autobiography (in spite of his denials at the beginning). One must admire Dr Peck's honesty in cataloguing his many physical (smoking, drinking, various health problems)and psychological (marital infidelities, addictions, relationships with his kids, and other) problems. It makes me feel a little more human, but it wasn't what I expected when I bought the book."
1,Arrogant and narcissistic,I am deeply disappointed in this book. To allow his wife and children to be humiliated by his 'sins' or addictions as he refers to them is unforgivable. I have read the 'Road Less Traveled' and assumed Dr. Peck was a person of integrity. I thought he was a Christian with a love of God and a moral person. I don't get the point of the 'Search for Stones'. It seems like a rationalization for his behavior. It's time he grew up and took some responsibility for his actions not blame everyone else.
2,HMMMM?!?!?,"Wanted to get insights . . . after reading a bit, more just wanted to stay awake. I'd read Peck's other books, so I knew I'd have to read a lot to get the tidbits . . . weeeellllllllll . . . never found them!"
5,P-3000 Great item!,This unit was exactly what we were looking for - a way to take selected pictures with us for friends to view. The picture quality is great and it is very easy to load the pictures to the unit. We absolutely love it!
1,Outrageous cost of repair,Epson USA wants a flat fee of $300 to repair this viewer device that costs $399 new. Buy a viewer today and after the warrenty expires you will pay 75% of MSRP to have it repaired. Another item for the landfill.
3,Don't buy this to save pictures on trips,"Reviews to save pictures on trips is on the wrong tract. Buy this device to display pictures. You can buy Compact Flash 32 GB for $80. You can buy Secure Digital High Capacity 32 GB for $35. The top reviewer bought this ""storage device"" to continue using his 512 MB compact Flash! For $80 he could have multiplied his storage by 64x and never needed this ""storage device"". I take all of my pictures in raw & jpeg with a Canon 5D full frame camera, 12.8 mpxl. Using a 32 GB CF, I get 1,400 pictures. I carry 2-32 GB CF cards for a total of 4,200 pictures on very long back pack trips. The total cost for these cards is $240. So - don't buy this 'storage device"" to save money - buy it so you can show pictures to friends w/o taking your laptop with you."
4,Great in Europe,"This viewer did exactly what I hoped it would do...download tons of pictures from my card to later enter into my home laptop. Although it doesn't offer much editing features, it does allow deletion on the very clear 4"" screen and that is enough for me. Battery life is exceptionally long and there was no problem using it with a convertor in Europe. Once home, it easily downloads into albums onto the computer. I am not techy and even for me, it is enough user friendly to be a great buy."
5,Great Storage Device,"I got this to back up pictures off of my CF cards for my digital SLR. There's plenty of storage, easy to use, and is very versatile! This is the perfect accessory add-on for your digital camera. Don't go with a cheaper alternative. This is well worth the money!"
4,Epson P-3000 40GB Multimedia Storage Device,"The P-3000 is a great device to review, edit store and share your digital photography. The large screen allows for the viewing of my photos in great detail and clear focus - much better than viewing on my digital camera. The slideshow function allows for the playing of my favorite music while viewing the slideshow of favorite pictures. I would definitely recommend the P-3000 for all photography buffs. I would rated it 5 stars but for the limited battery life."
3,Not For Me,"This product did not work well for me. I wanted an easy and lightweight backup for photographs to take on trips. This unit is relatively heavy. Transfer is slow.More important to me: The interface is clumsy and non-intuitive. For example, it took a lot of trialand error to create a folder of a few pictures to show to a dinner group.But the killer was that this unit froze twice during the trip, i.e., responded neither to the touch interface nor to any manipulation of the on/off switch. Leaving the unit unplugged until the battery ran down and thenrestarting it did work. I don't believe any pictures were lost, but I've lost my confidence in trusting the unit for important backups.The unit has a huge amount of space. It may just suit the needs of other users. My unit may be defective.So don't write this off if it meets your needs."
5,Great,"I bought this item for my son and he loves it, it was in good condition when I received it. My son is a Michael Jacksons fan so he watches it all the time!"
5,all around good,good service on time product was in like new state have nothing but good comments about this seller
5,The Jackson Story DVD,"Excellent picture, I first saw it on tv (PR) and I liked very much, look for it and finally I founded on your site. Thanks very much. Picture, excellent, artists excellent!"
5,The Jacksons an american dream,watched this on youtube before buying it- it's great and it has a lot of good music too
3,Too long to receive,"I am a hugh fan of Michael Jackson and I order this they day after he passed. I didn't receive the movie for almost a month later. I actually forgot I ordered it. The product was in mint condition. The only complaint I have is it took to long to receive the product, otherwise merchandise was in excellent condition."
5,Satisfied,The item arrived on time and in the conditioned it was ordered. I am satisifed and would order from this seller again.
3,DVD with no additional features (or extras) inside! why ?,"Its really great to know that the miniseries The Jacksons: An American dream is finally out in DVD format. The quality is really good, it contains 2 DVDs... but I am very disaappointed when I learned that no additional features (or extras) inside!How come ???"
4,"Great DVD, but...","Great story line and music. But, I would have like to have some behind the scene footage. I had originally taped it from WABC in 1992 on my VCR, and was pleased when it was released in this format."
5,A biographical history of the Jackson Five music story!,"Film traces the early days of the sixties and seventies with Michael, Tito, Randy and Jermaine Jackson's music career on how they formed together under the influence by their father Joe who was very abusive and rough also to hard on his children as musicians. Cause theyneeded a manager for touring and contract of recording albums by Motown studios under president Berry Gordy. It's very indepth and to get a retrospective view on how they formed as a singing duo pop sensation played by all of these black child actors who actually did a great job portraying every Jackson brother in it's family!"
1,shipping,"This product took almost two weeks to ship. Why? If they are going to charge my card right away, then it should be shipped right away. I ordered this product one week ago and it still is not shipped. It will be shipped next week. This is not good customer service."
4,Great miniseries... but DVD without extras !,Its really great to know that The Jacksons: An American Dream is now out in DVD format. I really like this miniseries but I am quite disappointed on the lack of extras. How come ???
5,Jacksons an American Dream,"Great soundtrack, great story, good acting, the music in this miniseries was great to watch again the second time, I would recomment this movie as I would the seller . Product arrived ahead of scheduleThe Jacksons: An American Dream- The Complete Miniseries"
5,feedback,"My family are Michael Jackson fans, and we first saw this movie on VH-1. We would watch it whenever we could. It is a wonderful movie about the Jackson family and how the brothers became musicians/singers and discovered by Diana Ross. The actors are very good in their respective roles. The movie features Lawrence Jacob-Hilton, Angela Bassett, Billy Dee Williams, and Vanessa Williams. Also, the hit music of the Jackson 5. Wonderful for the whole family to watch."
5,Review of The Jacksons Miniseries,"The Jacksons - An American Dream was an excellent depiction of the life and times of an African American family from Gary, Indiana who had a dream to be stars in a business that they loved. It shows not only the success of one of the biggest groups of all time, it also gives us a peek inside the emotional development of arguably the biggest entertainer of all time, Michael Jackson. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves music or simply loves a good story."
2,disappointment,"this dvd is a disappointment because of the horrible sould quality on most of the live performances, i couldnt' wait to get this dvd because fear factory is one of my fav bands and I was going to blast this on my surround sound and have my own mini fear fac concert at home but when i turned up the juice on demanufacture it sounded like [fecal matter]!!! maybe fear fac didn't have enough money to overdub the songs, who knows but its' just like some guy recorded the concert footage on his cheap camcorder, the interviews and the videos that are pretty cool though"
1,One word for this DVD...SAD!,"What a terrible way to make a DVD.The sound and video are terrible.Only about 2 songs are half way decent.Fear Factory are one of my favorite bands but they lost my respect with digicrap and now this lame excuse for a DVD comes out.They try to make these hi-tech futuristic graphics and then have video that looks like someone was taking it with a fisher-price camera.Don't bother getting this if you havn't wasted your money on it already.Some good DVD's to get is.NINRammsteinEarth CrisisPanteraSteve Vaijust to name a few.If all your interested in is seeing the music videos then i guess you could buy it,But don't expect to see a concert that is watchable."
2,disappointment,"this dvd is a disappointment because of the horrible sould quality on most of the live performances, i couldnt' wait to get this dvd because fear factory is one of my fav bands and I was going to blast this on my surround sound and have my own mini fear fac concert at home but when i turned up the juice on demanufacture it sounded like... maybe fear fac didn't have enough money to overdub the songs, who knows but its' just like some guy recorded the concert footage on his cheap camcorder, the interviews and the videos that are pretty cool though"
2,i'm disappointed,Very cheap... The video Clips are fine but some of the live clips are really bad. I have better DVDs of bands a lot more underground...
4,Beautiful and unique rendition,"While not an expert on the Christmas Oratorio, I have been a ""fan"" of Nikalaus Hornoncourt since the Telefunken Bach Contatas (Concentus Musicus Wien) - I have them all) led me to purchase this DVD which, although over 25 years old, the recording is brilliant and shows the intensity of Hornoncourt at his best. I have heard Hornoncourt's interpretation is rather controversial, but I enjoyed it greatly. I recommend it heartily!"
2,I must not like Japanese RPGs,"I must not like Japanese RPGs, because I barely made it through the first act before losing interest."
3,Not the best but it serves the purpose,"Overall it was not a great game. I am glad I played it, the combat system which I at first did not like grew on me. I found it very linear which is not a problem for me. I avoided most of the side quests so I could just finish the game. So it filled a void where I did not have a RPG to play, so it gets 3 stars from me."
5,Enchanted Arms,"The A.I. has improved alot, in recent years this game has proven that.Though i wished they had of gotten rid of the term based fighting system.real-time fighting is the wave of the future.Ventura"
5,Best accounts of the CW that I have encountered,This book is the absolute best day by day history of the Civil War that I have ever encountered. It makes you feel as though you are there and able to relive the actual day's with the soldiers and commanding officers. Every care has been taken to cover detail and events as they took place. I would love to see another published dealing with the Civil War Hospitals by the same author.Mr Denney excels in his field. Thank You for a GREAT book and information contained therein.
3,It's nice movie,"The story shows a lot of love and affection in a family comprising of mother and daughter Priyanka (Gul Panag).On the other hand, Esha (Eesha Koppikhar) shuns her family and lives alone to achieve her motto of making big in the fashion world.In the meantime, Varun Malhotra (Sohail Khan) tries different ways to vow Esha who, initially, refuses to budge but at the end realises his sincere love.Also Radhika (Amrita Arora) who has to try hard working at both the places, at home during the day and at the call centre during night, is at the receiving end. She is always depressed after she comes to know that her hubby Arbaaz Khan is having an extra marital affair. So she starts ingesting tablets to fight depression."
4,Kansas City Bomber,I loved it. Yeah it's old and cheesy but most 70's movies were. Besides how can you go wrong with a young Raquel Welch!
3,I really enjoyed this move,"I really enjoyed this movie and not because it is by any means a masterpiece. I first saw this movie as a teen and it was a lot fun watching it again after all these years. Even though the acting was so so and the plot was nonexistent my wife and I still enjoyed the movie. Would I watch it agin, no would I surest a friend see it well no. All in all if you remember ""B"" movies from the 70's and enjoy some mindless entertainment then give this on a try otherwise it is probable better to pass on this one."
3,No Wonder They Made No More Roller Derby Flicks,"This film is a missed opportunity. Roller derby inherently has the ingredients for great sports satire a la ""The Bad News Bears"" or ""Slapshot"". Instead the makers opted for melodrama. Instead of concentrating on the action on the rink, which is filmed unspiringly by director Jerrold Freedman, we are inundated with Raquel Welch's affair with her club's sleazy owner (Kevin McCarthy) and her foibles as a single mom. In a way these subplots do give the film some camp appeal but not enough to my liking. This film does contain a couple of good supporting turns by Norman Alden as the club's enforcer and Helena Kallianiotes as Welch's chief rival on the team. Kallianiotes did similar scene-stealing in a bona fide seventies classic, ""Five Easy Pieces"", with Jack Nicholson."
2,Great roller skating,I remembered this movie as being better than it is. the filming is very unprofessional. It looks like a home video. The rollerskating scenes are still good though.Bratz Girl's Skate Shoes
3,Could have been better,When I bought the movie I thought I was buying the full length feature from the movies. It wasn't. This was the condensed version that has been shortened several times for TV. Love the movie and love the sport even more.
4,knockout,"This came out in the early 1970's. Must have seen this entertaining flick about 8 times over the years--and never tire of it. The one and only Raquel Welch--one of the most beautiful women I ever laid eyes on--was perfectly cast here. She does a wonderful job, possibly the best of her long career, if not the best, at least one of her best performances.Having said that, I should add that the mother seems miscast in this film. I found it hard to believe that the actress they got to portray Raquel's mother was the best choice.Anyway, hey, check out the rough and tumble world of the roller derby and re-visit Kansas City Bomber--and if you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat, especially if you're a Raquel Welch fan.Glad it's out on DVD."
5,More great stories from Poirier,"Naked Pueblo was a great introduction to Poirier's unique take on pop culture/college days and thrift store life..I found Goats to be even funnier and twice as hard to put down. I have read it three times.Now Unsung Heroes comes thru in classic form.This time around the humor is a little more subtle but the stories are much richer than in Naked Pueblo). My wife read me the entire book on my drive from Norfolk to New Orleans, and i cant wait to read it for myself on the drive back..."
2,So Disappointing,"What may be perceived as topical edginess does not equal entertainment. These stories each have several things in common, most notably that they proceed in an obvious manner, focusing upon the desperation of the characters and the clear motives for this desperation. Ultimately they go nowhere. This book isn't terrible. Its pedestrian. That said, I would rather be angered enough to put something down than simply lulled to a dead end while waiting to be stirred. This book is simply boring."
5,**brilliant! charming! ourstanding! terrific!**,"yet another witty, intelligent, thought-provoking, twisted book from the ever delightful mark jude poirier. his odd characters fit right in with all the grostesques in literary history. you almost feel you need to keep children away from these protagonists, but boy wouldn't they be interesting companions on a long plane ride. i am eagerly anticipating his next book!"
4,"Easy to use, good value","I have a manual sharpener, but in reality almost never use it. The electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no-brainer. There's a coarse grinder for knives that are dull. For most knives the fine- and polishing-grinder works just great. If you have inexpensive knives, the coarse grinder will chew them up, but if you have well-made knives the Waring will work well. I've had good success with the Waring."
4,Waring sharpener,I am quite satisfied with this knife sharpener. It leaves a nice sharp edge on my knives. The only negative is that the blade edge nearest to the handle can't be reached. I think this is probably true with any sharpener.
5,Great knife sharpener,Very easy to use and produces a much sharper blade faster than I have had with many other sharpening methods.
1,Don't waste your money,"Sorry to say, but this moved too slowly from screen to screen and was rather dull. It's too slow for children, let alone to play with adults. I didn't see where the ""leveling"" was evening things up for children to play with adults. It's just a ""miss"" as far as games go. You're better off with Playstation or Nintendo games than something like this."
5,Movie Miracle Must-Have!,"Made for a miniscule $11,000, ""Suckers"" proves that dedication, creativity, and talent can turn a first-time film effort into a darling little movie. The Sativa Brothers ambitiously enter the urban latino comedy genre, untouched since ""Born In East L.A."" (1987), with a lovable crossover movie that ranks in the low budget arena with ""Clerks"" and ""El Mariachi."" ""Suckers"" is a must-have for any aspiring filmmaker and guarantees laughs to viewers who don't go to church on Sundays."
3,Ferret out the slapstick,"In this low-budget, low-brow Latino yuk-fest about the bad guys vs. the good guys in the Los Angeles barrio, Weezo the ferret (played by Weezo) comes to the aid of a poor sucker (Danny De La Paz) just when he needs help the most. The movie is not about Weezo, but the charming little sable is featured in several scenes (swimming in the pool, noshing on a Mexican meal, etc.). The movie has some pretty obvious, over the top humor, but it's so likable that you just can't help but root for the hapless hero."
5,Excellent and entertaining.,"Disregarding minor quibbles, I have to say that I have not been so entertained by an Oz book in quite some time, and I admire (i.e., agree with) the way the author handled many Ozzy contraditions and puzzlements. Unlike so many authors, he chooses to address head-on such knotty questions as fashion in Oz, change in Oz and in Ozzy characters, etc. that have mostly been unanswered questions until now; I think he provides reasonable and workable answers. I had a hard time putting down this _Cat_. Thanks for a good read, David!"
3,Lovely pink brains,"Another original book from Books Of Wonder's line of Emerald City Press titles is Glass Cat Of Oz. Written by David Hulan and drawn by George O'Conner, this book highlights Bungle, the glass cat that first appeared in Patchwork Girl Of Oz. The story involves a twin brother and sister who find a genie that grants them the ability to transform using the magic word ""Pryzqxgl""(from Magic Of Oz)and then sends them to Oz. There, they become involved in a plot to save Queen Ann from a bunch of punks called the Bad Lads who use the gun tree to take over the land of Oogaboo. Along with Glass Cat, Trot, Cap'n Bill, and Hungry Tiger, they manage to save Ann in the others just in time for Betsy Bobbin's anniversary. This was a good book with references to most of the original 14 Baum books, although it might seem a little too much like author wish-fullfilment. But it's a good read for your average Oz-phile."
2,Not what I was looking for.,This book isn't a good book to use if you're looking to develop VoiceXML applications. This book delves too far into proper software engineering and doesn't give enough information about the VoiceXML standard (doesn't touch vxml 2.0). I wish I would have purchased the wrox version that covers voiceXML.
3,the first review,"Your panel is beautiful. I would like to know if it is hand crafted? if it is, what type of cutting tools did you use. very nice product, I hope, if it is hand made that you get your $$ worth in your time and efforts.admire, a nice piece of work; even if it is not your own (author unknown)"
3,Good content Poor Design,The book is very helpful. The layout does not make for easy reading. The book would be much better with good visuals and less chunky paragraph style writing - the virtues of bullet points especially during pre-exam reading.
2,Awful text,Awful textbook that was a pain to get through. Better off with google than this random array of topics. Don't reccemond.
4,this is a quality product,"if someone is going to massage you, then choose the tiger tail. otherwise i recommend the 'The Stick Marathon Stick'. i have the latter at my gym and it rolls a little easier when you do a self-massage."
4,The cure for sore muscles,"My husband and I train for a few athletics event per year. When we finish a tough workout, we have to jokingly fight over who gets to use the tiger tail first. It works, and was totally worth it. We use it right after the workout and again the next morning. This is the first time I have felt so moved to write a review, it's that good."
3,I've got both this one and The Stick and like the stick best.,I had this for about a year and it just didn't get used much at all. Picked up the smaller travel STICK and oh yeah that one gets used. This one looks more rugged but it doesn't flex while the smaller Stick seems to do just that. I've used that now on regular basis and this though on occasion I get it down and check it out....goes right back up on shelf and back to the stick. In part you can blame my ganglion cysts perhaps on wrists that intefere on how well I might get this item to roll along. But then again have to use the same wrists to apply pressure to the Stick too. Over all I'd recommend the other brand but his one is not useless. I think for some it's great and for those with strong arms and wrists it might give them a better work out using some arm muscles too. For me it's a pass. So I give it 3 stars for those who might like and take off for not beating the competition before I discovered the competition.
3,Good for your calfs,A useful product for working out calf tightness after a long run. Comparable to similar products and good price. Roller sometimes binds. Perhaps this will improve with use.
3,Works as intended but is awkward to use on yourself,"This product was recommended by my physical therapist. It functions as intended, and is basically a fancy version of a rolling pin. In fact, my PT said you can just use a rolling pin! You grip the orange plastic ends and press firmly to roll over your tightened muscles. It is awkward to roll over your own muscles---nothing wrong with the product. It may be of more value if you have someone to use it on you, as opposed to trying to roll out your own muscles. If you have a rolling pin, see if you would or could use it first before wasting (or investing) $ into this type of product. If you do buy this type of product, know that I spent hours reviewing them and this particular one came highly recommended."
4,I do use it,"I use it. It's not as amazing as all the other reviews make it sound, but it does help. I would buy it again"
5,Works Great For Shin Splints,Ordered this tool to help roll out my son's sore shins. As an athletic trainer I have used many different techniques to treat shin splints. They can be very difficult to treat to say the least. This was not an over night treatment by any means but was the most effective technique I have used. After only a couple of weeks he was back to practice pain free. Great for stiff sore muscles after a work out or a long day on the job too.
4,Works nicely,"I got the roller for my boyfriend and he loves it! Because he has a wide back, I wish I got the 21"" length, but the 18"" works just as well."
2,Not So Fresh,I used this product as directed hoping it would help relieve the redness and burning in my eyes. For me it was a waste of money. Visine does a better if not totally satisfactory job.
2,Buy the Harvard Business Review article reprint instead,Excellent content; just not a book's worth. The authors say virtually nothing more than they did in their superb HBR article of the same name a few years back. Another case of a fine 10-page idea gratuitously expanded into a book.
1,Don't be fooled ....,"Notwithstanding the allegations about ""book-buying"" to get this book up the business charts (which I have no idea about whether they are true or not), the real disappointment here is the book's content.It falls victim to two of the most dangerous pitfalls of management books(1) excessive post-rationalisation (e.g. ""I've got a nice, simple model and by god I'm going to make these examples fit it""), and(2) picking winners (e.g. ""here some companies that are successful ... here's some things that they do ... if you do them then you'll be successful too"")meaning that the result is evangelical (""you will believe"") rather than a detached, objective view of what makes some companies successful and others not. Either that - or it's just a very long way of saying (again) ""stick to the knitting"" ! To say that the book oversimplifies the integrated nature of the modern corporation is a massive understatement.Treat the recommendations with extreme caution ..."
5,Staying focused on core value proposition,"The book reemphasizes the importance of product or service leadership, customer intimacy, and operational excellence. Organizations willing to be ""anything for a buck"" will find they loose touch with their customers quickly as they thinly apply talent and resources to serve everyone averagely.Unity of purpose is also essential; a successful firm must act together to consistently and successfully compete. The book is good reading for managers and marketing professionals that need to review their business focus and the alignment of tasks, processes and competencies supporting that focus. The book offers materials to be used in team exercises."
4,The Discipline of Market Leaders,"In this book the value discipline model of Tracy and Wiersema is explained. They use examples of well known companies to support their arguments. Despite the book is written in 1995, it still contains some valuable lessons to be learned today."
2,Masters of the obvious,"The authors are masters of the obvious. If you don't agree with the premise presented in the introduction, then a read is worth your time. The premise is simply that to become market leaders, a business must choose between operational, customer or product focus then make this focus central to their mission and value proposition. This book would be good for the reading list of an intro business strategy course."
4,Try not to excel at everything,This book has greatly assisted me to help focus on some very important issues. Our company was suffering from some negative customer feedback - and after analyzing the situation - we came to the conclusion that this was in fact caused by our desire to be good at everything. The premise of the authors - to be leaders in our field - suggested that we should focus on one discipline - not all 3. This is liberating and will greatly assist us to let go of some of our sacred cows and help us focus on what we should deliver to our customers - intimate relationships. Hopefully I will be able to write a postscript in 12 to 18 months time - when we have completed the transformation of our company.
5,Great Diapers for the price,"Some diapers fit better than others on different body sizes and shapes. My child is neither small or large, more in the middle. Great fit for ""regular kids. If you have a smaller child, I would suggest you buy Huggies. Larger baby, get Pampers. Great price per diaper at Amazon."
1,Blow-Outs Everywhere,"Luvs are priced great, but it does not make-up for the fact they are horrible at stopping blow-outs. My baby wears a size 3 and she blew-out everyday this week including twice in one day and this morning. She is within the lbs according to the package (and not on the cusp), but I am switching brands. I searched online for reviews because I saw a TV commercial last evening for Luvs blow-out protection diapers. I found nothing, so far...just people with the same gripe as me. I am stuck with a giant box I recently bought; however, I might gift the remaining to my cousin...who I do not like."
1,Horrible! Leaky USELESS pampers.,"My daughter's daddy bought 3 super size packs of these when we bought her home from the hospital a few weeks ago! He tossed the reciept. The money back guarantee only works for 1 pack and you must have original reciept or I would have taken these back. These leaked more than any brand I have used with my 1st child or this one. I have been washing more clothes, bedding, and scrubbing out poo and tinkle. Even the smallest amount leaks right out the leg! Every single time even if the baby is sitting up. Not much fun to have poo leak all over your own clothes while holding baby. Expect to do a LOT of washing and soaking if you buy these! They suck!"
4,mango salsa for the head,"great album combining a cleanly-produced, fresh patchwork of loungey beats, ethereal vocals (here and there), and samples taking cues from all over the world.think carribbean-ized jazzanova/nightmares on wax/headz mixed w/ basement jaxx on sedatives (see ""skin"") mixed with soundtracks for saturday morning programs for kids (see ""pencils for dolphins"").although a bit brighter and more colorful than what i usually gravitate toward, this one's really grown on me."
3,an important source on fundamentalist Christianity,"This is a good book, and I recommend it, but it's not perfect. Although Ammerman did a lot of ethnographic work, it seems like she relies mostly on interview material rather than direct observation, and that was sort of frustrating. I have to assume that if what she was told by her subjects had contradicted what she saw, she would have said so, but I still found myself wishing I had a clearer picture of daily life in the congregation. Still, I don't know of a better book on the same subject -- that such a good book as this has these limitations only shows how difficult a subject it was to tackle."
1,Horrible storyline,"Although it is visually captivating, the storyline couldn't be worse. If you are DYING to see it - rent it, it's not a buy."
2,Pretty lame,"The DVD player on my set pooped out after about four hours of use. The problem is that the DVD player part of the unit appears to be removable, but it's not. Now if I want to hook up a working DVD player to the TV, I'll have to have two DVD players sitting on the shelf. The design and execution were both very poor."
5,I love this music,"Chick Webb swings hard. This stuff will get your feet moving. The more I listen to it, the more difficult it is to turn it off. Now I understand why Gene Krupa said, after the Benny Goodman band played against Chick at the Savoy in 1938, ""Those cats cut us to ribbons."""
5,Unbelievably Exciting,"This book drew me in and put my imagination in overtime. The graphic descriptions and candid look into the torments of this couple's story made me feel as if I were watching it all unfold. The story line was intriguing, insightful and very informative. I know this book will be enjoyed by many."
5,best ninja turtles game ever!!!,"I've been a big ninja turtles fan ever since I was a 4 year old, so when i saw this game for sale, i decided to check it out. t was AWESOME!!!!!! Real good, solid beat em up game for the GBA with nice graphics and sounds. Only minor complaint is that its rather short. I recommend this for any beat-em up game or TMNT fan."
2,dissapointing coming from these authors,"I could not wait to get this- I love most of their books. But it had few recipes, and what was there was nothing I did not have in many other books.The book says on the cover it is about traditional cooking of New Mexico. Then has recipes like fajitas, which they even say came from Texas fairly recently. What is there is fine, but I suppose I expected more traditional native american dishes that had influenced New Mexico, not what I would consider to be typical Tex-Mex."
1,Disappointing as best,"The authors produced a much better book when they compiled The Border. Rancho de Chimayo has very few recipes, some of which call for Velveeta of all things, and the warnings about drinking and driving in the Cocktail chapter, are annoying.This restaurant may be the darling of the New York food writers, but NY food writers don't know anything about Southwestern food.Spend your money elsewhere."
2,placebos?,"I took this stuff for a while, and I really didn't notice any relief or discomfort in my hips or joints.It's pricey and you're expected to continually take these forever to improve your joints.I think just regular exercise and managing your weight is the best thing you can do to take care of your joints."
5,Puts his techniques with reach,"For those of us who wondered how he came up with his sound this is an ""aha!"" experience. This is not just one of those videos that shows flashy playing and then moves on. The explanations make sense and though they are not always simple to follow, they are within reach. It's nice to see that it is explained much more in terms of arpeggios and chords rather than scales since most of us guitar players are much more familiar with chord spelling than we are with mixolydian mode in the key of D or similar jazzspeak. Everything he does is tabbed out in the book that accompanies the DVD and for that someone deserves major props."
1,Larry Carlton,An excellant guitarists.The vidio is for entertaiment purposes.You are not going to learn nothing Carlton goes way to fast.Gilbert Campagna
5,wonder,"If you want to be infused with wonder for the God of the Universe, this book is filled with great aspects and ideas. Heschel is a man so sensitive to the changes of his time, that his writing is as fresh today as it was 50 years ago."
4,God is Everywhere,"* ""Man is Not Alone explores what may be the largest question of a believer's life, What is God like? Heschel says that there is a God and presents an idea of what God may be like. More importantly Heschel discusses what kind of attitude people must develop in order to have a relationship with God. Even an atheist will find this book beneficial because Heschel lays out a standard for how people should treat each other. He also makes it clear how we must view and treat ourselves. God is a force that is always here for humanity in this book. Heschel proposes that the task for us is to reach the highest level of humanity. - [...]"
1,silver?,"tell it like it is. 'silver' is mentioned 3 times in your review. the thing is stainless. im looking at the item, not the price. decieving."
1,AudioLearn : DAT,"This is not a good product for DAT prep. It is EXTREMELY basic. If you got a C or better in freshman Biology, these tapes have nothing more to add. Spend your money on the kaplan book and the topscore tests. Good luck on the test!P.S. Instead of selling my used tapes I threw them out. I felt that if I sold them I would be taking advantage of someone."
4,expensive but worth it,"Don't expect to learn all the science you need from these tapes. However, they are useful. I listen to them in the car on my way to and from work. Then when I see the material in a textbook I already know about the topic and it makes it much easier to learn and remember.The cost is high for what you get, but I couldn't find any substitutes and it is worth what you pay for it. I would buy it again and recommend it. Good luck on the DAT."
1,Not worth your time,"If you are serious about the DAT and are shooting for a very competitive score (20+), I wouldnt waste my time with these cds. They are way too basic. When it comes to DAT prep materials, Kaplan seems to have the monopoly, and I havent encountered much that can really compare."
2,Still dont know what IMC is,"This book claims to explain integrated marketing communications and presents several case studies. The book is well structured. However I still cannot make sense out of it. IMC is a concept of integrated communication to change the behavior of customers. Right. But exactly how are customer behaviors changed? After (kind of) intoducing the concept, the book describes each communication tool in a separate chapter. But how are these tools exactly intergrated? What rules can be applied? I did not find anything I can use for my course.To be fair, the prospective reader is actually warned about the marketing skills of the authors: the cover is wonderfully desiged with silver characters on pink background with a white graphic that looks like a molecule structure. Integrated marketing?"
5,Works!!!!!,Did as advertised........creats a good seal and sucks 'her' right up into it...........my gal loved it!!!!!
3,More fun,"Another item for fun with my wife. The supplied bulb pump works better on this than the breast pump but, is better with the guaged pump."
1,kind of cheezy,"1st time I used this, it broke. Company did send a new one, and I just have to be very gentle with it, and it works ""ok""."
5,Good for taking with you,"I have a nice large study Bible that I use for church, but for trying to read through the Bible in a year, this is a nice and small version suitable for reading on the train or bus without drawing too much attention to what you're doing. A good travel Bible because it is so thin."
1,Sometimes it looks like gold.. but it's fools gold,"I have to say this is one of the funniest comedies I've seen.. unfortunately, I laughed in all the places the film was trying to be serious.Put simply.. it's not very good. The acting is bad.. the script is bad.. the only really good thing I can say about it is that San Diego is pretty and looks great in the film.It's supposed to be Goonies meets Stand by me.... and it's a pale copy of both with none of the humor or drama. For almost a hundred bucks the only reason to buy this one is if your kid was in it."
1,HSC smells.,"i suppose its a good maths book, but i hate maths too much to give it more than one star.'sorry."
3,Pleasant Background Music,"Pleasant, though routine, arrangements of popular Christmas tunes. Expertly played, though mainly nice background music. Similar to ""Christmas On The Mountain,"" but with different tunes, of course.Christmas On The Mountain"
3,Raw,"Bryan Adams has had a serious make-over since 18 TIL I DIE. That album laid to rest the scrappy and scruffy Bryan Adams and gave birth to a more adult contemporary, dare I say, fashionable BA. The album photos revealed a more sophisticated BA, and this DVD is an extension of that new artist. The stage and lighting is artistic and highly conceptual. The bands clothes and overall vibe seem very ""VH-1"" (for lack of a better adjective). They pull it off quite well, as we can't stay 18 forever. The only gripe then is the actual performance. Without the benefit of a 2nd guitar player AND keyboardist, it is impossible for the BA band to recreate the sound of the original recordings, especially from the Mutt Lange era (Waking up the Neighbours and 18). The crowd picks up the slack however, raising the energy level as the night goes on. I loved the look of this DVD and the audio is actually quite good, but without a full band...it's hard to give it a perfect score."
4,Just Like I Was There,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 68 year old boss who is a huge Bryan Adams fan. After he watched it, he loaned it to me and I loved it. It was just like I was there. Relived some fun times from the 80s with these classic Bryan Adams songs as well as his newer hits. The crowd at this concert was totally into this concert which really added to the fun of watching it. Great gift item for a Bryan fan!!"
2,This is not a good concert,"I've seen alot of concerts of my favorite musical artists. From U2(Zoo TV, Elevation Live from Boston) to Randy Travis, and I thought the Bryan Adams concert from Ireland would exceed my expectations like the others did. Man was I wrong. The music is good, or at least most of it. The problem with this DVD is the way it's filmed. The stage is a ball of white light, Bryan is wearing a WHITE shirt, playing the BASS guitar and the video director shows the crowd more than the band. Of course this may be because there are only 3 band members. Don't waste your money on this DVD, it [STINKS]!!"
5,BADAMS PURE ROCK AND ROCK HEART!!!!,The dvd is asome a really must have concert for your badams collection no doubt badams surprise us playing the bass guitar on the entire concert anyway the dvd is asome i hope badams release the unplugged soon on dvd of course and the video anthology so far so good also
2,Bryan Adams Live in Ireland,"I was very excited to see this in my local music store. After the Unplugged dvd I was expecting another brilliant musical journey. I was SO disappointed. On this video, Bryan has cut the band back to a 3 piece, just himself on bass, Mickey on Drums and Keith on guitar. Gone are the keys and the second guitars of previous recordings. Even though it was mixed by Bob Clearmountain, the band sounds thin and unremarkable, especially when Keith takes a solo and there's no 2nd guitar to fill the space that Adams normally slotted into. Also, the white set? What's with that? Everything is white. Clothes, amps, guitars kit, lighting (although his lighting has always been weak) I saw these guys live in Perth in '96 as 5 piece and they rocked. It's a shame they didn't maintain that on this recording."
4,different point of views,My sister gave me this book as a gift when I told her I was pregnant. It has been a lot of fun finding out the different points of view about having a new baby. From nursery rhymes to Charles Dickens advice you can go through this little book enyoing every word of it.
4,Fifties Fins (Enthusiast Color),"The written information contained in the book is well done. I learned some information about the ""fins"" I hadn't known before. The color photos are just great.But I think there are a few cars that could have been ""talked about"" and not pictured and some that are talked about but should have also been ""pictured"". There are photos of cars with really questionable fins.And how many photos of 55, 56 and 57 Chevys there are (along with a 58, 59 and a 60)! Not one 55, 56 or 57 Ford???? They do have fins (more than that 58 Chevy)! In fact, there are only about 6 FoMoCo automobiles in the book and only 2 or 3 are actually Fords. One of those photos is of the engine compartment only showing an old flathead V8! Fins???Now, Chrysler and GM and some of the smaller manufacturers are all well represented; as they should be."
3,good,I like this book .happy perches it looking for more this kind of books I love history of the cars .
5,Best low-budget horror movie ever!!!,"I'm so glad I accidentally stumbled upon this movie. I don't even want to start telling you what this movie is about. I can assure you it has the best twist ending since the original Saw. It is freakishly original, And fresh to the genre. Some of the acting is off. But the main character makes up for it. So if you love horror movies and you're not afraid to watch low-budget films this is a movie for you."
1,Ground Hog Day in a Junk Yard,Nothing much here! Just marginal acting and the repeating of a plot over and over again. Just like Ground Hog Day with no plot or character development. Instead of waiting for the ground hog you are waiting for some guy to take off your face with a carpet knife.Don't worry there is no sexuality or nudity...
2,Time to flush,"This film is like having diarrhea. You sit there for 90 minutes doing your thing until you come to the realization your arse is numb and it's time to wipe, flush and go on with life. Nope, no sir, didn't like it."
3,strange,"this movie is a little strange and hard follow, but i have seen worse i got it for $4.00 so i can't complain."
3,A Fairly Good Movie,"This movie was alright, it was nothing to brag about. The movie plot was easy and simple. It's about a woman who works at a gas station; her boyfriend was supposed to pick her up and instead somebody was there. All of the sudden, she experienced dayjay view. It's happening over and over again.In my opinion this movie is like an eposode of Charmed when the three witches experience dayjay view.(Prue, Phoebe, and Piper).I give this movie an c+."
3,Blockbuster? I think not.,"If you want a movie with second rate acting and production values then this is the movie for you. Salvage is a direct to video movie by the folks at Echo Bridge. If you are familiar with the work they do then you know what I mean. Other than that it was a fairly decent movie. It features an interesting plot that at least you will not have guessed after 5 minutes of viewing. even when you think that you have it, guess again. So on the plot alone I would rate it 4 stars, but the weak production and acting only rates 2 stars. For the price ($5.00) I was not disappointed."
5,silence of the groundhogs.,"What a movie! I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this. I picked it up on a whim at the local video store- and this is one of those movies that snuck up and got me. Without giving too much away, I can truly say this film had a twist ending that didn't reveal itself until the last two minutes of the film. Along the way I had speculated a few times about what was going on and was extremely wrong. I will continue to look for films made by this group of people, and I am thrilled to have found what one day will probably be considered an underground classic. Don't let the DTV style fool you, this is a great and cerebral film!!!!!"
1,Not worth even the low price.,"Really a terrible movie. The only reason we watched past the halfway point was cause my girlfriend didn't want me to feel bad about spending money on this movie. Ironiclly she has no problem making fun of the movie enough not to let me pick movies. There was one funny part, but besides that the cheap price wasn't worth it. Very bad."
2,SALVAGE CAN'T BE SAVED,"Cerebral and manipulative, SALVAGE is an independent thriller that ultimately caves in on is own plot devices. Lauren Currie Lewis plays a young girl who keeps getting murdered over and over, she thinks its a weird dream but the script hints at something more. Is she losing her mind? Who is this demonic Duke and what is her ultimate fate? Lewis gives a good performance but it's not enough to save this muddled, confusing and ultimately unsatisfying psychothriller."
3,A Real Strange Movie,This film was ok but kind of strange . The girl who was the main character was very good although the movie was different and not what I expected I think that overall it was well done .
2,Salvage Review.,This movie doesn't not look like Blu-ray first off. It looks like something downloaded off the internet. That's how bad it looks to me. But mroe important is the movie itself to me was BORING. Although the movie was like mystery/horror I wasn't feeling this movie at all. It it actually looked like Blu-ray It might of been a bit better.
1,horrible movie,Let me put it this way....takes a lot for me to rate a movie a 1 star....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,SALVAGE THAT CAN'T BE SALVAGED,THIS MOVIE WAS SO LAME. THE WRITTING / PLOT WERE REALY BAD. A WAIST OF MONEY.
1,"The worst, most boring, most ridiculous film ever made","Ok, I bought this movie because it had ""Awards from blablabla festival"" written all over it... I started the movie and.........NOTHING ever happens !Bad music (when there is any), bad actors, bad sound, bad imagery, bad everything.I've seen alot of bad bad bad movies, but this is just 1h19min of pain... litteraly !Remember those movies with nothing ever happening for real but it's always ""Oh my god ! the bad guy is after me ! Oh my god he's gonna chop me up !"" and the dumb girl wakes up ?This happens like 30 times during the movie !BORING !!!!!!Don't buy this, let other people be as dumb as I was when I made that mistake..."
4,"SUPERB NOIR -- INVOLVING, COMPLEX MORAL DRAMA","Otto Preminger's WHERE THER SIDEWALK ENDS (1950) is another color noir, this one's about a troubled, brutal cop already on probation who accidentally kills a murder suspect. Desperate to protect himself, he pins the whack on a hated shark who's committed similar kills. When the cop falls in love with the stiff's widow, he remains mum when her father is charged with the murder. Oh what webs we weave when we first deceive...This complex and involving moral drama about a guy who puts off doing what's right until it's almost too late will keep you involved and guessing until the final fade out."
4,A Very Satisfying Noir Thriller,"Here we have another Dana Andrew/Gene Teirney/Otto Preminger gem. This is a gritty and well-rounded story with great performances. Unfortunately, not nearly the showcase for Teirney that ""Laura"" was, but then she's not the title character. This is, from beginning to end, Dana Andrews film.Andrews' character is a classic film noir anti-hero, only based more in the real world than say, your Marlow's or Spades.I'd definitely recommend this to any Dana Andrews fan or to anyone who enjoys an old-fashioned thriller. I genuinely did not know how this one was going to end. Great film."
4,Tough Noir,"Engrossing account of tough detective(Dana Andrews) who accidently kills a murder suspect and is simultaneously trying to pin the rap on a mob boss(Gary Merrill) while trying to extricate a cabbie(Tom Tully) of guilt. The cabbie also happens to be the father of the dead man's wife(Gene Tierney) who Andrews takes a shine to. The film is a hybrid of noir and pulp fiction but entertains nonetheless. I found it a little too slick to qualify as classic noir. The film benefits by a solid lead performance by Andrews whom you find yourself rooting for despite the character's obvious flaws. Andrews and Tierney maintain the chemistry that they established in ""Laura"". I didn't buy entirely Tierney as a working class model. Through no fault of her own she's just so damn beautiful to be considered a classic noir babe."
2,Repeat,I've already submitted a written review on this book.?.It was written in the 1950's. Beyond the org. date it has NO supplements or updated info added.
5,A book I return to over and over.,"I'm a big fan of Mary Wikins Freeman. I have over the years collected all of her books of short stories...this is one is my favorites and I have read it over and over again. It is a little collection of stories about people who have found themselves alone..and what making peace with and surrendering to that state of being brings into their lives. The gentle simplicity of their world written by Ms Freeman in her beautiful style, draws you in and keeps you thinking about these characters long after the story is over. My copy of this book is a first edition, over 100 years old now and is so fragile I have to treat it with kid gloves.... so I am very happy to see a reprinting of these stories in paperback form so I can enjoy reading them over and over again for may more years to come."
3,"Really 2.5 Stars. It's okay, but I've read better","I'm not sure how this ended up on my to-read list, but I'm guessing it has something to do with the references. The Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya Sisterhood? Read it and liked it. The Breakfast Club? Great movie. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants? Love it. The book even has a blurb on the cover from Ann Brashares, ""PEACHES is a sweet and delicious read."" So, I picked up the book and started reading hoping for another wonderful coming of age story. What I ended up with was something meh. The book was okay, but nothing in it blew me away. Full review listed on my blog (find it on my Amazon profile page)."
3,Sweet,"A sweet coming of age story about three teenaged girls. It deals with friendship and loyalty and learning who you want to be. The three main characters each have unique voices and I loved them all.The real strength of this book is in its descriptions. Ms. Anderson has such a way with words that you feel like you're right there in the orchard surrounded by the trees and the thick smell of ripe peaches on a sweltering summer day.Although not quite as good as Tiger Lily, this was still an entertaining read that will immerse you in its setting."
5,Peachy keep and not just for teens!,I bought this book because the Nook version was only 99 cents and I'm SO glad I did. This is a beautifully written book about life and friendship. It doesn't matter that the main characters are teen girls--this book will ring true with adults too.
5,Amazing book!!,"I am absolutely in love with this book. I read it a few years ago and just now got it on my kindle. It's wonderfully funny, juicy, and, in a word, badass."
5,Peaches,"I am a 13 year old girl, and I would highly recommend this book!I was actually attracted to the book because I was just scanning a shelf and just so happened to see this nice pale orange spine staring back at me (it turns out that not many books have a pale orange spine). I read the back and thought it seemed like a good book, so I bought it.If you've read any other reviews, some people say they loved The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, and saw comments or something that said they were similair, so they read it. Well, I actually bought The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants at the same time I bought Peaches and I read them both on vacation. They are very similair, and both excellent.Peaches is about three different girls--Murphy (who's in trouble with the law), Leeda (who just wants to be with her boyfreind), and Birdie (who just wants to fit in and save her family's peach tree orchard. The book is all about friendship, boys, fitting in, saving something you love, and of course, peaches!"
3,"boring, waste of time","I recommend reading this book only if you have tons of time on your hands and don't mind shallow characters.When I checked the book out, it looked so cute and cheery.I found it sort of depressing and boring though. Birdie was the only likeable character in my opinion. I thought Leeda was so pathetically insecure, shallow, and selfish, and Murphy was an irresponsible, dishonest floozy. Neither one was very admirable. I thought Birdie was more honest, mature, and hardworking than the other two. It wasn't a horrible book though. I thought the ending was nice. The three girls changed for the better. I wish they had shown more of the moms' changes. They were all so distant from their own daughters."
3,Mercy,"""Mercy"" is a collection of poems by a poet that I discovered only last year. Lucille Clifton's ""Blessing the Boats"" is a fantastic collection of the most moving and lyrical poems I've read in many years. It was a great discovery and I was eager to get ""Mercy"" to continue reading her more recent work.""Mercy"" is more terse in tone, the tension deriving from the gravity of her subject matter. It is more weighty and erudite than the collection in ""Boats,"" but every bit as profound and endearing.Lucille Clifton died on Feb. 12th from a protracted battle with cancer. The world has lost a significant voice and I am glad I can honor her in my class rooms. I will make sure her poems live on in the minds and hearts of young people. She deserves a permanent home there."

4,Great work out.,I thoroughly enjoyed this challenging and fun work out. I like using the bands and the way Kira explains what muscle or area that is being targeted. There are also 3 different work outs that fit any time frame you have available to exercise. It is also easy to adjust your work out to any fitness level. I won't get bored with this workout any time soon!
1,No good,I bought this and sent it back immediately.It looked like someone made a video in their living room.Very amateur looking video.
3,*very* amateur amateurs,"typically housewifeish ""models,"" if you can call them that.most were thicker in the thigh and/or larger in the chest than i prefer, but you might like ""chunky"" and/or ""rockhard,"" respectively.after they strip to the mundane music, some vacuum and some dust, around the set.nothing to write home about, certainly... nothin at all."
2,Just mild T&A,"This set is o.k. for T&A.; The women are attractive and all I hoped for a little more. Better genital shots ect. And maybe a little more effort in household clean up. Add a bit of jiggle.Oh, skip the high heel shoes."
4,Beautiful video wallpaper.,"First, the women on this DVD are all beautiful. They all perform solo in each chapter. I would recommend this DVD to someone who likes to have something of this kind to watch. There is no plot at all. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a movie with a story line. The DVD is a double feature with both movies being similar but with different performers. The movies run 53 and 58 minutes. The soundtrack in mainly music with some brief solo dialogue."
4,Sudoku Game Board,"I've enjoyed Rubik's Sudoku every morning since Christmas. It's near perfect. I would change just two things:I'd include more of the marker pieces (I'm always at least one short), and I'd use some color other than midnight blue because it doesn't show up on the black gameboard. Unlike the AD photo, my game pieces don't have painted numbers, so the blue ones are nearly invisible. I like that the pieces are double-sided with a different style of number on the reverse side. You can use one side for the pre-determined numbers, and the reverse for the numbers you fill in. If you goof up and have to back-track, you know which pieces to leave on the board. The book with the pre-determined numbers have plenty of puzzles - I haven't had to repeat a puzzle yet. You can also set up the board using puzzles from the newspaper or any puzzle magazine. I would recommend this set to anyone who enjoys Sudoku."
4,possible typo?,"For what it's worth to those reading this:--on pg 17, in TITLE section, a reference to 2Kings 4:10 is made for usage of 'euaggelizo' in LXX. I don't see it there, but do see it in 2Samuel 4:10."
4,Beautiful melody but lacks variety,"Being Julia OST has a beautiful main melody which occurs over and over again throughout the tracks. I especially like ""Curtain Up"" and ""Quite Alone"". However, Being Julia OST doesn't have other strong melody to show along side with the main melody which seems a little too simple for a complete album. The movie is great too. Annette Bening's performance is outstanding."
1,This is a dumb book and disturbing...get a new job!,"I can't believe they even published this book...anyone can, if Yuko Taniguchi's books are published."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"I am a preschool teacher and I bought this to use in my classroom. I loved the idea of it being wood - not plastic. I am glad I only bought one - rather than the 4 I contmeplated. I was surprised by how small the bowls were and that they were just attached by a thin string. Somehow, the children kept getting the strings all twisted around the main ""post"". I did like that the bowls were fairly high so it was clear which side was higher and which was lower - with some plastic balances I have used, there is so little room for the bowl to move, it is difficult to tell which one is heavier. My students did enjoy playing with it, I am just not sure it is worth the realitively high price."
2,Not that great,"It would be nice if this actually balanced when things were equal. As it is off out of the box, it is not a great teaching tool."
5,Great book! Easy to read and understand.,"I was inspired to get this book after hearing Maxine Clark speak in person at a special event. Her book is great for those looking to start a business. It is written exceptionally well and in simple terms... which to me, makes it easier to remember the key points of each chapter.For some, it may seem hard to see past the kid-focused ""Build-A-Bear"" examples... But Mrs. Clark often points out how her theories and philosophies for running her business were developed from other companies like McDonalds and Starbucks. Bottom line... there's something for everyone in this book. It will definitly inspire the entreprenuer in you."
1,Biblical Spirituality has nothing to do with spirituality,"Larsen's treatment of spirituality is severely lacking. In fact, to put ""spirituality"" in the title of this book is extremely misleading. The text is simply a concise treatment of basic systematic theology written at about an undergraduate level. The only thing Larsen includes that might possibly justify the title is a small section at the end of each chapter that asks questions about how the principles he lays out are applicable to life, but that's a far cry from what he set out to his readers.Now, I suppose if you're looking for a very simple, basic text on Christian systematic theology, this would do the job fairly well, but to state that it is directly related to Christian spirituality is simply false. For a theological treatment of spirituality, a much better text is Simon Chan's Spiritual Theology."
4,pronunciation for everyone,"Very good for a wide range of intermediate students.Succinct, attractive presentations. Good for first presentation or for review.My students like it."
4,This is not completed. You need the Volume B.,"I didn't know that this grammar book is composed of volume A and Volume B. After I recieved this book, I realized that. But I guess there is combinated one. Also, you can buy combination with work book less than regular price. Be careful, when you buy this book, make sure if you need just Volume B."
2,Not impressed!,"Boring workbook. The understanding part of the title was very misleading. You have a chart with few examples and based on that chart, you are supposed to understand the content. After the chart you have an exercise and that's about it. Nothing spectacular. If you want to sit and do boring worksheets, this book is for you."
2,"Should have been good, but was awful","This is the only romance book I can remember where I was hoping against hope that couple didn't get together. Finally, I figured maybe they deserved each other. This was an utterly tiresome story. If you want to watch a relationship advance by slow, boring inches, this is your book. The guy actually says several times ""Ashley, I'm getting more impressed with you"". Who says that?? The magic part of the story was decent, and often funny. The rest was just bad, BAD writing..."
2,Tedious,"A boring book. Writing this review to provide the blurb from the back cover since it's not included in the product information.---Ashley Douglas has had the luxury of being raised in a wealthy household, which resulted in her frivolous lifestyle. Cut off from her ""allowance,"" she struggles valiantly to become responsible with her spendthrift habits. But despite all her material possessions, Ashley cannot buy the one thing her heart truly desires -- the love of Jordan Bennett.That is, until Ashley purchases a beautiful silver bowl in an antique shop -- which she discovers possesses magical properties. And even as the bowl's enchantments help resolve her squandering ways, another kind of magic is working its charms upon Jordan -- and the growing love between them...---"
1,Tedious,I was surprised at how badly written this novel was. The character dialogue is laughable and the couple is bland and boring. Don't waste your time.
2,"Nice live work, not one for electronic music fans","Sadly disappointed with this one. Gahan's studio offering was well produced, however the live show trades the album's clean atmospheric studio qualities for Gahan's still desparate desire to emulate the rough cut sound of his idols - Doors, Bowie etc - simply kills the Depeche Mode cutsBetter to get Martin Gore's Loverman Bonus DVD containing great live footage, or better yet wait for the release of the Depeche Mode Devotional DVD (here's hoping) to see both great showmanship (dave) and excellent versions of classic Depeche Mode."
4,the part of Depeche Mode is only.... part,"Dave Gahan i s good singer, but hi heard little hard. The perfomance is excellent"
4,Not to be scared,"The man behind the camera is Anton Corbijn, so it can't be a bad film. The concert has a great atmosphere. I think the venue is right for Dave, the audience was great that night. The only thing I can remark as negative is the fact that 2 songs are missing: ""Policy of truth"" and ""Enjoy the silence"". It's unfortunate because the whole concert was very good and those 2 songs were performed just with basic equipment, just acoustic instruments. Besides that, this DVD is worth buying for all DM fans."
4,"Awesome concert, slightly inadequate product","Glad Dave Gahan decided to tour strong for his debut album; Great concert, but sadly incomplete DVD - missing the final encore that was shown on the TV special. Still, I picked it up, if nothing else, to show my support for this great performance from an underrated musician."
2,Poorly Edited,"Editing seems to have been limited to running the text through a spell checker. Page 69 refers to ""a Frame Rely network"". Page 72 explains that an ISDN BRI provides ""two barrier channels"".Frequently diagrams include acronyms for which no explanation is offered, as if the figure was shoveled in from somewhere else. There is no glossary of acronyms and many are missing from the index.An entire chapter is spent on RIP1, with redundant statements about the lack of VLSM support and obsolete status.My experience was that issues of technical sublety were as often muddied as they were explained.There is good info in this book, too, but considering the Cisco name, I expected much better."
4,Barbara's 3-drawer hall chest,"The chest is really well constructed. The finish is very nice but the color is darker that shown on the illustration. Had I known it was darker than illustrated, I probably would have selected something else."
3,Rolling work seat,"The only reason I'm giving the AZM rolling work seat 3 stars, is the comfort of the seat and the fact that it rotates, while I'm working in the garden. The wheels are set in one position, there is no ""steering"" ability. You can go straight period, so its extremely difficult to maneuvere or move from location to another."
3,"Nice but NO ""smell of Christmas"" scent","I have always loved aromatiques ""smell of christmas scent"" and could not find anyone that carried it other than Aromatique themselves. I have been buying it (smell of christmas) for years and could not believe a few merchants had NEVER heard of it. They must not carry much aromatique. Anyhow, this is a nice alternative but it's not as strong and it does not last that long either.As I said, nice but its no ""smell of christmas"""
4,Perfect for the couple planning a Christian Wedding,"My husband and I used this CD last summer when we were married.We had live vocalists at the wedding itself, but played this CD as background music as the guests were gathering for the reception. It is a good CD for brides wanting to listen to music for possible songs to be used at the wedding. ""My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme from the Titanic)"" doesn't sound like Celine Dion singing, but is more appropriate for a church setting.We were married in a Roman Catholic church, so we were not allowed to use anything but traditional hymns, but many churches would allow this type of music during the ceremony itself. It would be appropriate for a first or second marriage.I would recommend this to brides beginning their wedding plans. I used to drive around in my car and listen and dream about the wedding! It also helped to keep my stress level down!"
3,"Not really a horror movie, just a chiller","And yet one more movie from my childhood has found it's way into my collection. To be fair I knew this one wasn't a great movie even then, but it did have the ""creepy"" factor that works well even today. A few deaths and a lot of ""strange things"" happen and that's it. But the thought that at any moment something might happen keeps you guessing.After a very strange wreck Ms. Ross and Mr. Elliott(A real life couple) are taken to a Estate run by some very strange people. The owner is about to die and they along with the other visitors are in line for the title prize.The rest is for you to find out on your own. This is a slow moving movie and it has very little if any gore. This is one that sets out to make you feel creepy and to that end I felt it did the job nicely."
4,Well Traveled,"This is yet another film I intially viewed during my youth. Considering some of the special effects are dated by today's standards, the film still held my interest.It is what I call a ""Fake Scary Movie"" i.e. it won't mess with your head too much as, alas, I've gotten too old (plucked nerves)to handle the hard core bumps and boogies of today's technology (LOL)."
5,Great Movie,"I love the 80's movies and this one, ""Lagacy"" was great, more of a thriller horror, basic story line, nothing fancy or too many special effects, but the characters were great they made the movie and Sam Elliot which is one of my favorite actors was very persuasive in his role as the boyfriend and skeptic of what was going on inside the mansion. Overall I gave it five stars."
2,Boring,"I bought this movie after reading the rave reviews on this site. I have to say I was highly disappointed. Although the 2 main characters are very likeable and their acting is good, the disco-type music in this so-called scary movie was just annoying. I also found the 'love-scene type' music very inappropriate. The type of music they used just made me hate the movie even more. I was hoping for a 'haunted house' theme in this movie and it just didn't deliver. I will give this movie 2 stars because I liked the 2 main characters. There are no gruesome murders or anything like that in this film."
4,Very relaxing,"I enjoyed this CD very much. It has an excellent instrumental combination. My favorite is the hammered dulcimer, which create that ""chime"" sound. I also like the clawhammer banjo solos. Definitely worth it!"
2,Condition less than average,This item was described as in good condition. Items that I have purchased in the past have been in a lot better shape than this. Cover was faded and fairly battered with corners bent. I donated this to a school and for the price I would have hoped it looked a little better.
3,DVD/RW,Unit wooks well for basic backup. To use the print on the disc feature you have to purchase the appropriate coated discs.
1,Problems with commercial DVD (this is a lite on drive HP label),"I have used this burner for a few months now and just recently it started having problems with reading commercial dvds. It wouldn't even recognize the dvd and locked my system up. After a lengthy internet search I figured out (not on HPs web site) that I had to change the firmware to LiteOn LH-18A1H which the drive seems to actually be with a HP label. Download a couple of programs and flash the drive and it was back up running again, but it now reads as a LiteOn drive. Maybe I should have bought a LineOn drive in the first place. This seems to be a problem a lot of people are having with this drive, so beware, although it hasn't completely stopped just yet. (I will amend my rating later if it does)."
2,Unreliable,"It was a great little unit while it lasted, but mine died after about one year of use, rapidly losing the ability to read DVDs. I opened it up, and it was very cheaply made, with very loose tolerances on the drive mechanism."
1,Doesn't live up to HP legacy,"Worked fine as a burner until the tray door would not open anymore. I didn't buy it for the lightscribe feature, using that NEVER gave good results, always a blurry faded washed out image on the label."
5,Great price on a great HP burner/player,"Same HP burner/player that is $30 or more in the local stores.Installation was fast and easy.Nero software installed fast, very little info on the Nero products,to play dvd you need to install the Cyber DVD player on the Nero disk."
2,Hard to figure out,"Can't get the contrast or printing right. Manual/help is not user friendly. I'm afraid to call hp, they'll probably charge me an arm for tech support. I suppose will be worth it once I get it worked out, need a lightscribe for dummies book."
5,Excellent,"I already had a HP 840i, but my dvd player drive was misreporting file sizes, Instalation was quick and easy, and NERO software works well."
3,it's plastic! OEM was steel,"it works fine and came on time but I don't like that it was made of a composite material instead of steel. These 'plastic"" parts are inherently inferior to steel because they will be more affected by temperature than will the steel part. But on the good side the part fits and works well."
2,defective sets,I BOUGHT THIS SET FROM AMAZON. CD ONE WAS A MIS-LABELED COPY OF DISK TWO. I CONTACTED TIME-LIFE AND WAS BLOWNED OFF. I PURCHASED A SECOND SET FROM AMAZON AND THAT SET ALSO HAD NO CORRECT DISK ONE. DISKS TWO THROUGH FIVE SOUND GREAT. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT TIME-LIFE WOULD BACK UP THEIR PRODUCTS BUT THEY DON'T. I HAVE BOUGHT FIVE OTHER TIME-LIFE SETS IN THE PAST AND ALL WERE VERY GOOD.
1,Does't hold cans and jams constantly,"Bought this can opener to replace a fully functional model after a kitchen make over to stainless steel. Nice solid construction seemed like this it would be quality product,but it just doesn't work!Incredibly difficult to get the can locked into place under the blade. Once the can is locked, the motor jams while trying to open the can. When in the locked position, the system stops. You need to hold the lever up just a bit, to allow the can to turn and open. After a month of frustration I returned to the local BB&B; for another. Exactly the same problem.Been living with it for over a year when today I decided I won't be dealing with this POS for the holiday's. Just ordered the West Bend based on the reviews. Hopefully that model will fair better than this garbage.You've been warned."
1,Have you ever seen the movie 'Groundhog Day'?,"There must be a defect in the product. It seems that some have had it replaced only to 'break' again. ? I get a little further around the can if I'm lucky. Then it 'slips' off the 'cutter', then you start all over again, again, again, again, again, well, you get the picture. I don't have time to troubleshoot and return and wait for a product that is obviously not worth the trouble. Not worth time, trouble or frustration. Sorry Cuisie"
1,Junk,"Have had this unit replaced 2 times already. The motor quit twice and the lever broke off also. For such an expensive can opener you would think it would perform a little better. Customer service also makes you pay for the return shipping! Agree with all the other reviews, dont waste your money!!"
4,Cuisinart Electric Can Opener from Amazon,"We have several other Cuisinart items in our kitchen, so we were not surprised with the quality and appearance of our new Electric Can Opener. Our review would have been 5 stars if the opener would have worked easily on larger cans. We participate in a ""Soup Kitchen"" program at our Church and would rather be able to use the larger cans. I believe I can figure out a way to do this."
1,Worst can opener cheap or expensive,"It opened cans OK for about the first month - I thought I somehow might be using it incorrectly when it didn't. It worked less and less reliably the more I used it. After about a year it took about 2 minutes to open a can - having to re insert the tooth into the can lid, trying to puncture all the spots it missed. Finally the arm broke off when I lifted it to inspect the tooth - never ever buying anything from Cuisinart again - that was my first and last cuisinart product."
2,I'd Love to Love it,"I'd love to love it, but I can't. Purchased this a few years back, and was trouble after the first month or so. While it hasn't broken, as so many others have, it is pretty bad. I have to attend the unit each time I open a can by holding the handle up, ever so slightly, or else it will bind up. I actually came here thinking I might find the 'magic bullet' that would show me the simple fix for my problem. I was able to figure out how to use my Cuisinart Rice Cooker by reading one of the reviews for that product. No such help here, it seems. I love the look and size of the unit, if the cutter/can rotator worked together, this would be a 5* product. It works just well enough for me not to be able to justify pitching it and getting a new one, but that's weak praise."
1,Horrible Experience with this can opener,"Doesn't even deserve one star! Only did 20 cans and many messes later I've had it. Paid a lot of money for the name and it's looks but what a mistake that was! Wish I would have read all the reviews first. No one should have to fight and fuss to open a can like you do with this one. Called Cuisinart and they are sending me a new head (said it's only for people who call and complain, no recall!!!!) I sincerely doubt the new head will be any better but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now. Made in China, maybe their cans are different? Lost my faith in Cuisinart products and hope they honor their warranty since the product is discontinued."
1,Cuisinart SCO-60,"I wish that I had read the reviews before I bought this can opener. It obviously has design flaws that they chose not to correct. Cuisinart replaced the first one when it broke after about 3 months, but they wanted me to pay for shipping the old one back, which was approximately $46.00, DUHH. It only cost $49.99 new, so why should I send the old one back. When the 2nd one broke they refused to do anything because I didn't send the original one back. This will wind me up with Cuisinart in general and I will never buy any of their products again, plus I plan to tell anyone that will listen about this very unpeasant experience.P.S.I feel that I must add a post script to this review. I talked with the nicest lady and she insisted that they send me a new can opener and only wanted me to cut the cord off the defective one & return it. I'm sure it will have the same design flaws, but they did stand behind it and my wife thinks it's pretty."
1,Piece of junk,"It is a piece of junk, not even useful as a paperweight. It will not latch onto a can and will not spin the can and take off the lid so it is of no use. I invariably have to reach for the hand crank opener. Huge disappointment at $50."
1,Extremely Poor Product,A beautiful stainless steel case but that is all. The can top is cut ragged leaving it sharp and dangerous. Many times it fails to turn the can so you have to help it along by rotating the can. It rips the labels to shreds. This product is a waste of money. I do not recommend it.
1,Cuisinart - Worst Electric Can Opener EVER!,"Don't be fooled by the Cuisinart name or the appealing look of this product. As others have said, it is an expensive piece of junk! We have fought with it for several months now; my husband can fix about anything, but he can't keep this thing working. The problem is that it will not hold the can in place; it makes no difference the size of can, from a 6 oz can of tuna to a 32 oz can of tomatoes, it doesn't hold the can securely in place. It's a battle to try and hold the can up tight enough for the blade to cut around the can, with it constantly slipping off the clamp. I have cut my thumb more than once, pushing up on the can to get it to clamp, while it repeatedly slips off so that it can't maintain a steady cut! I am throwing this in the trash and picking up a hand-held can opener - at least I know it will work as long as I'm able to crank it - and I can put it in the dishwasher to clean."
1,Don't Ever Buy this Can Opener,Talk about form over function. We bought this can opener because we needed a new one and recently converted all of our appliances to stainless. Our mistake for buying something that looks nice but can't even perform the task for which it is made. Our can opener simply went dead in less than six weeks. Just stopped functioning. No grinding. No noise. Just an immediate demise. Now we're stuck with an expensive paperweight.
1,Worst can opener ever!,Literally used it once then it broke. It should be recalled for being an absurdity. Don't ever buy your wife this can opener as a holiday gift. I hope they accept it as a return.
1,Failed after 3 months,"I relied on the Cuisinart brand name, and for a month is was great. Latched onto every can, good cutting with a powerful motor. Now I can't get it to latch onto a can. Looks great, Doesn't perform. Not recommended."
3,worked great for about a year,"I purchased this at another store but I trust the ratings here and usually check here for pricing and reviews prior to purchase and often will buy here. This opener worked great for us for about a year. Then the magnet fell off. I am kind of handy so I took it apart and replaced the magnet but I must have done something wrong because it will no longer hold a can without holding it by hand. Then the plastic part that holds the cutter on broke off. I called their customer service 1-800-726-0190 and got right through and gave them the model and serial number and they said they would send me out a new part free of charge. I know I have had this over a year and do not have any receipts but that was not an issue. Hopefully it will work like new again. If not, I will post an update. Hope this helps."
1,Lousey product,"The only reason I give this product a star is because there is no trash can to put it in on this page. I was so happy when I got this can opener, as I have arthritis in my hands and the hand opener was too hard for me to use. I thought the Cuisinart Brand would be so nice to use, with no problems, why wouldn't I it's a ""CUISINART'....Well I have totally changed my mind about the company and the products. They make crap and don't stand behind their products..I will never spend good money on another product of theirs and will defiantly tell others of the problems I have had....DON'T BUY IT..SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO SEARS, PENNEYS....ANYPLACE BUT CUISINART!!!"
1,"This is not a can opener, It's a can't opener.","Is there anything less then one star. I wish I had read all the reviews regarding this can opener. It lasted less then 2 months, then I started calling Cuisinart, only to hear, our computers are down. What I think is, that they don't have a fix for the problem. If you purchase this unit, it's only your fault."
1,Do not buy this product. You will end up throwing it away soon.,"I got this for my husband for his birthday. Within 4 months of light use, it didn't work at all. To make matters worse, it trips the GFI fault protector in the kitchen. Cuisinart may have some good products but this can opener is not one of them. This was throwing away around $50."
1,Worst can opener I ever owned.,"I was so hopeful that I had found the perfect can opener. I was so disappointed that it started out OK, almost opening my tall can, but week by week it gradually stopped opening anything. It just refused to grip the can, wouldn't turn it against the cutter, and so wouldn't open the can!Admitedly, it looks great in your kitchen, but that is not why it is there. For utility it is a waste of your money. I recommend you buy a different brand entirely."
1,Don't waste you $$ on this item,"I bought this can opener like many of you...the name of the company. I have many appliances from Cuisinart. This is by far the worst can opener I have ever owned. As I am typing this I was trying to open a can of blueberries to make muffins. I can't. The ""can"" opener will not ""open"" the can. It won't even latch on to it. Save you $$. Not worth the hassel."
1,What a piece of junk! Don't buy this headache!,"I purchased this can opener about a year ago, and I thought this would be the last can opener I would ever have to buy. WRONG ! It worked o.k. for the first 4 or 5 cans then the arm/lever cutter attachment started to get loose and wobbly. After that it was all over, you had to struggle to make the cutter fit over the can lip without slipping off. I contacted the manufacturer and requested help, they sent a new part that was bad and I tried it again, worked fine for about 4 or 5 cans then the same thing happened. I now have another boat anchor! Don't buy this product, in fact Cuisinart should remove this product from shelves because I have read only bad reviews for this can opener. What a P.O.S.!"
1,Cuisinart SCO-60 can opener,"I agree with other reviewers!!! This pricey little appliance purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond is a piece of junk and has lasted less than six months. Of course I never kept the receipt because I stupidly figured I would not need it having bought a top of the line can opener! Appears to be the exact same problem everyone is else is having with it. Cuisinart should be embarrassed by this! Shame on this company for manufacturing such junk and charging $50.00 for it, and then having the nerve to not stand behind their product."
1,The worst can opener!,"Save your money on this one. If you want problems. then this one is for you. The can opener has been a problem from day one. It eats the paper off the can and inserts it into your can, the blade falls off, etc.... it goes on and on. This one should be a recall!"
2,Great until it breaks,"This was the nicest can opener I ever owned until the plastic part of the lever broke. Cuisinart does not sell the part separately. They probably decided that by the time it broke you will love it so much that you will fork out the $50.00 for a new one. I found the part at Forum Appliances online but I will never buy another Cuisinart appliance. When a part is removable and breakable a reputable company carries the part. I could understand if the appliance was discontinued, but this is ridiculous."
5,Cruisinart Can Opener,The Cruisinart can opener that I purchased is great. I've opened all sizes of can with it and it works perfectly
4,So far so good...,"I bought this at a local store, and after reading the reviews here, I was somewhat concerned. However, we have had it for about a month and it has performed flawlessly so far. I will followup with another review if that changes. Positives: very attractive, solid, stainless, easy-to-use. Negatives: too pricey, reliability is unknown.UPDATE: We have now used it for over 2 1/2 years and it still works fine. Admittedly we don't use it all that often -- perhaps weekly."
1,Cuisinart Can Opener Defective - Don't Buy,"The handle lever is made of plastic and only lasts a month or two. Once it breaks, the can opener is useless. There is no replacement part on the Cuisinart web site. Don't buy this product. I then purchased the West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener. Awesome. One hundred times better and also cheaper. It is a much better design."
1,garbage,the can cutting detachable part for cleaning must have been designed by a shoe salesman or a politician.as much pressure variance this has to handle.it was toast before it begun .the motor seems good .its pretty.flies like a lead balloon.
1,VERY BAD DEAL,IT ONLY WORKED IN SOME CANS FROM DE BEGENING AND NOW IT DAS NOT WORK AT ALLCuisinart SCO-60 Deluxe Stainless Steel Can Opener SCO-60MARTHA BERNSTEIN WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM ?
1,Avoid this product,"I'm echoing all the other complaints here about the plastic cam failing under normal use.I am not sure which is worse: the original design being allowed into production, the lack of customer service, or the company not standing behind an obviously flawed implementation or material choice.You may choose any of the aforementioned, but I will choose NEVER to buy another product with a Cuisinart badge affixed to it."
1,Junk,"Please save yourself a headache and buy something else! This stylish, expensive piece of kitchen equipment is obviously for appearances only as it simply will not open a can without a serious hassle. I'm going back to the old fashioned hand crank and I won't even give this to the goodwill. It's going in the TRASH!"
3,Splish Splash Messy,Nice looking can opener. Very quiet. However it spits at the end of each cutting cycle. You must keep pressing down on the lever to minimize splashing. Christmas gift. No box. It will be returned anyway.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this gadget from a department store a few months ago. I am so sorry that I did. The small, cutting mechanism never stays in place when you are trying to open a can. Also, it takes several tries to get the cutting mecahnism to penetrate the can in order to cut the lid off. I purchased this can opener as a replacement for my Rosle, which I had for quite a few years before it broke. I loved that can opener. I am now going back to Rosle or I will try the OXO can opener for 19.99."
2,Not good quality,"This is the second stainless steel Cuisinart can opener that I have owned. Both were gifts. Both broke within 2 or 3 years. The lever lost its pressure and it was very difficult to get it to pierce the can. Then it eventually just died. If I had the receipt, I could have taken advantage of the 3 year warranty BUT - that requires you send $10 for shipping and handling. Once you pay to ship the machine back, call it $20 to take advantage of the warranty. Not worth it in my mind. I'm going to go buy a cheap electric can opener next time."
4,Stainless Steel Can Opener,Well pleased with this product. The service received was very efficient and I highly recommend to everyone. I have no complaints on the product.
1,GARBAGE!,"This ""can opener"" is a complete piece of garbage. Please do yourself a favor and believe all of the terrible reviews that you'll find listed on this site. This was an expensive product, as can openers go, and it broke within days of taking it out of the box. Cuisinart refuses to fix it without charging me for both the cost of having them ship me a new one, as well as the cost of shipping them the broken one.To be honest, having seen all of the other terrible reviews of this product listed here, I'm surprised there hasn't been some sort of class action lawsuit created over this thing.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. PIECE OF JUNK!!!"
1,Beautiful but doesn't open the cans....,"I am very disappointed with this product. As listed in the prior comments, it is indeed very beautiful and I love the look of it in my kitchen. However, it is nearly impossible to get it to open a can. It takes many tries before it will pierce the top and most of the time, I just give up and use a hand held opener. I expected more from an expensive Cuisinart appliance."
1,Something wrong with this product.,"Went through two of these so called ""openers"" in two weeks.Second opener came with an internal plastic part already in three pieces.Spend your time and money purchasing another."
1,dangerous can opener,"I bought this can opener last week. I can't believe that, for $50, Cuisinart couldn't design a can opener that opens a can with a smooth edge. This thing is an accident waiting to happen. I wouldn't want my child (age 11) to use this can opener. The lid comes off looking like sharks teeth. Going to return it today and get something that cuts safely."
1,"Looks good, works poorly","This is the best looking can opener I've ever seen. Too bad it doesn't work well, and it broke before it should have. Beauty isn't everything.I received it as a gift in Dec 2006, and it broke eight months later, using it maybe twice a week. It didn't work well from the beginning: I always had to try 3-4 times before it would latch onto the lid. Eventually, a plastic part broke right where the handle meets the body of the can opener, rendering this item useless.I've used a variety of can openers, naturally, but I've never seen one that would cut the lids so badly--the edges would be rippled and super sharp. For the money, it should work better and certainly last longer."
1,Update,I tried to open a large can--what a joke. I could not get the can opener to make it around the can.
1,Save your money,"My husband thought I was crazy to spend so much on a can opener, I thought it would be one of the last I had to buy. I didn't even use it very often and it was broken within one year."
4,"Fun, What it's like to be one of the juror's","This is a fun book. The main characters are very likeable and the villians are downright nasty. If you like this author's other books, you won't be disappointed. This was quick and easy to read and kept my interest. She is a ""friendly"" author and writes a good story."
5,great book!,"Great book, held my attention from page 1. Felt as if I was in the courtroom along with the characters. Can't wait for something new from Laura"
2,dull and contrived,"I like some of the author's books, so i am assuming that her writing has improved over time. This book purports to be a murder trial seen through the eyes of the jury. The plot is very thin. The trial is probably as boring as a real one -- endless objections, sidebars, etc; i thought i was back watching the OJ trial. the romance has nothing at all original about it. pass this one by."
2,Where's the other shoe?,"Throughout the book, a case was being built against a murderer and during the time it was being built and fought over in court, I was waiting for the ""other shoe to drop"" or a huge revelation to be brought to light. Alas, that didn't happen. A few characters fell flat, some didn't even fit into the story and the end was anti-climatic. This story really needed a twist in the trial to make it a better read."
2,theft by deception,"those expecting legal fiction would do well to start theirreading with the afterward in which the author,who had recently served as a juror,describes this effort as ""a whole new wonderful frontier"". presumably this means the author's entry into the world of legal fiction, while,in fact, a murder trial is merely an incidental pretext for a thinly veiled romance. below average for the courtroom genre."
2,Not the original recordings,"This compilation, with the exception of ""A Thousand Stars"", consists of re-makes of the original recordings.Some are good, and sound close, but the re-made versions of tracks 2 and 3 and are too different from originals. Track 10 is different but not as annoying as 2 and 3."
3,Helped only a little,"After quitting biting my nails, my nails kept peeling and were paper thin. I decided to try Nailtiques. The product helped a bit with the peeling but didn't strengthen my nails as much as I expected."
3,Nice nails,"Nailtiquees,is very good for the nails, especially for me. This product keeps them in good condition and prevents, splitting nails and half moons. I am new to this product and am very happy with the results.LFW"
5,Great Item,"I did not purchase this from amazon but I will soon, great item I purchase this brand every month. results in a week or two, Follow directions."
5,Incredible Product,"This product works miracles on nails that are soft and splitting. I've been using it for about 2 months now and I've actually had to CUT my nails because they got so long! Instead of using the product every day, I use it when I remove my nail polish to put on a new color or new coat. I'm sure the results would be even better if used every day.For anyone who is skeptical about the purchase, just make it! It's 100% worth the money! It's a fantastic buy and you won't regret it!Another tip to help keep your nails healthy is to taken either a multi-vitamin or even just some Biotin. Together, the Biotin and Nailtiques Formula 2 will improve your nails dramatically!"
2,what's the secret??,"I have been using Nailtiques faithfully for over a month.....WHY does it peel??? Everyday I have to remove & start all over again. I have purchased all the proper products to enhance it's performance. Yes, my nails grow but are peeling a lot! There has to be a secret to why this is happening. I do wash & dry my nail & go by the book for application.Anybody have any answers??? I am not pleased at all w/this product.I have now switched to ""PINK GEL COAT."" Not peeling, is a thicker product. It is ""gel"" so it does allow nails to be protected. I shall now try & compare."
5,No more broken nails...,"Works great! My nails were in terrrible shape before I started using this. After just one week of using this product, my nails were already a lot better!"
4,Great product,"This is a great product. Having tried every conceivable product to repair weak split nails, this certainly is doing the job. Highly recommend."
5,AMAZING!!!!,I am addicted. Orangutans are so fascinating and they are just so cute! A show that would be appropriate for all ages. I highly recommend this series to everyone. Support this show and the preservation of orangutans!!!!
5,Amazing product!,"The sound was what i was looking for! Deep tone, not to loud.You can hardly hear it from the inside, you can but you can still have conversations without it being annoying. Overall i am 100% satisfy with this product. Magnaflow is the way to go!"
3,"Sound quality is poor, but otherwise nice","My son loves this and enjoys the realistic animal noises. The pictures are attractively and realistically painted. There is a good selection of farm animals.Drawbacks:- the sound quality is very poor. It sounds tinny and distorted.- the sounds are activated by a light sensor, which is covered when the puzzle piece is replaced. Unfortunately, this means they will also sound when the lights are turned off unless the pieces are in place. It has scared the bejeesus out of me when I've turned off the light in his room."
2,Poorly manufactured,"We got one of these as a gift, and couldn't get the back panel for the batteries to open. Tried using a small philips screwdriver, a safety pin, etc., and it simply would not open. The lack of sound was disappointing, though our child still liked the pretty puzzle. We got another battery-activated Melissa & Doug toy that was also a failure -- the ""Vehicle Sound Block"" toy that is supposed to make the sounds of the vehicles when the blocks are lined up correctly. We could get the batteries in, but the toy simply didn't work. No sound, no nothin.' This company seems to do well with plain wood toys, but when they branch out into electronics, the products are fairly shoddy. I plan to avoid their products in the future."
4,Nice!,"Bought this for our 15 month old son. He loves it! Really enjoys the animal sounds and has learned them quickly...esp. the dog! No trouble with the battery compartment opening or with noise distortion...but the animal sounds are a little interesting! But, BEWARE...am agreeing with a previous review...when you turn out the lights, any open puzzle spot will sound! Might give you a slight scare or might wake up your sleeping child!Otherwise, a really nice learning toy!"
2,disappointing!,"We usually love all the Melissa and Doug toys, but these sound puzzles are disappointing. I bought two for Christmas, the farm one and the vehicle one. We couldn't open the back to put in the batteries for the vehicle puzzle (as the other reviewer said), and for this farm one, the sound quality is so bad! The animal sounds aren't even recognizable in some cases. The puzzle itself is fine, but I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the sound."
1,Worst. Toy. Ever.,"At first glance this seems like a pretty neat puzzle. Don't be fooled. This puzzle uses photoelectric sensors to detect the puzzle pieces which seems kind of clever, until the sun goes down. This thing moos and neighs and quacks at all hours of the night. If there are pieces missing, and you turn the lights off (to go to bed, for example) this thing moos, neighs and quacks. Any flash of light (or darkness) sets it off. More than once I've been scared witless by this puzzle. Awful, awful, awful."
2,Good idea but poorly made,"I was excited about this product, I bought this one and the one with the zoo animals sound.First it work, but then it began to work only when it wanted...Sometimes one animal work, sometimes 2, sometimes all of them...But it's unpredictable and really frustrated overall!How do you explain to a 19 month old that the puzzle does'n't work all the time.At the end my daughter was not interested in it at all...Too bad!"
4,"Fun Puzzle, Tinny Sound","This is a fun puzzle but the sound is pretty ugly. The wood puzzle pieces are nice, but the noises are somewhat indecipherable. Regardless though, the puzzle was good quality and my son loves it."
2,"Cute, but...","The artwork is great, and the pieces are easy for little hands to remove and fit. The sounds are good, but there is no off switch or volume control, and, as it should be, a screwdriver is needed to remove the battery. I am not sure how it is supposed to work, but you can wave any piece over any slot and it will make a noise (for instance, wave the dog over the rooster and it makes the rooster noise), so I don't think it is a great learning toy with the battery installed, anyway. Also, if a piece goes missing, the board will randomly make that animals noise at anytime, day or night, unprovoked, which can be amusing, so long as it doesn't waken or distract your kid at an inopportune time. Ours was a sweet gift, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone, which is too bad."
2,Poorly made,"I've been so excited to get one of these for my son's 2nd birthday. We bought the pet one, and put new batteries in. The sounds worked great for about 2 minutes. Then none of them worked. Then only the horse worked. Then just the horse and the parrot. My son easily put the puzzle together about 20 times, so obviously it is too easy for him, but he was frustrated because the sounds were not working. Then the dog started barking for ALL the animals. I think the technology just needs a little improvement. Come on Melissa and Doug. You're better than this! We are taking it back!"
3,Sounds go off without correct pieces,"We have theMelissa & Doug Vehicles Sound Blocksso assumed this puzzle would have the same type of sound technology--meaning, when the two correct metal dots come together to complete the circuit, the sound would occur. Unfortunately, this system works differently and any movement near the metal dots with any of the pieces causes the sounds. My son loves the noises and they are good sounds...but I don't want them happening unless the pieces are in the right position (good cause and effect learning). At this point I'm debating taking the batteries out and just having it be a plain (soundless) puzzle."
3,So bummed!,Ok my 20month old son is learning sounds. What could be more perfect than this puzzle? Well...nothing expect this puzzle (and another I bought in an actual store) don't work! We bought brand new batteries for both puzzles so know that isn't the problem. Randomly during the day we will hear the kitten meow or the cow moo but that is few and far between. And NOT when my son is actually playing with the puzzles. Soooo bummed.
1,Haunting/Annoying,My friend gave me this puzzel. Now know why. To get it out of her house! The farm noises start up when you turn your lights on/off or when you walk past it. In the middle of the day/night you hear cock-a-doodle-do mooooo-mooooo. It becomes annoying and sometimes just plain creepy.
1,"Super annoying, you will not keep this toy for very long","Every time a shadow passes, or turn a light on or off it will make animal noises. There is no off button, or any way to fix this beyond storing it in a completely covered box or some other thing that will completely block all light. I mean the kids playd with the toy a little, but the annoyance of it constantly making animal noises all the time when not in use is ridiculous."
2,Horrible noises - and scares my daughter!,"The animal sounds on this puzzle are terrible. I think the sound quality is very poor, and so that, coupled with realistic animal noises, just sounds freaky to a little kid. My 19 month old tells me ""no farm"" and ""scary"" when she sees it.On an adult note - I HATE this as well, as I think the noise triggers from light, so if the puzzle isn't assembled when you hit the lights, you get some super creepy Moo'ing or Neigh'ing from another room - it also enjoys going off whenever the sun is setting, so can catch you off guard then as well!So not worth it..."
2,horrible animal sounds,I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old twin Grand Sons. The animal sounds are scary and don't sound anything like the real animals. I would not recommend this puzzle.
2,"Major Design Flaw, No OFF Switch","My daughter received this as a gift and she does enjoy the animal sounds that accompany the puzzle very much. The problem is that the puzzle uses a light sensor to activate the surprisingly loud animal noises. So the puzzle will go off with no one near it whenever there is a change of lighting unless all the pieces are in place, there is no off switch. Who wants to be crawling under the couch at 2 in the morning trying to find that last piece so that stupid cow will shut-up. It just boggles my mind that they would take the time and thought to design something so clever and then fail to include an off switch. Isn't that an unwritten rule for toys that make the noise? Or maybe they're just being authentic. I grew up on a farm and livestock do not have off-switches either, except for the butcher."
2,"not educational, noises go off for any piece!","just received this in the mail today and i'm not too happy. the pieces activate noise on any animal so there is no educational value to this. she can put a cow over the dog and here the dog noise. also, the sounds aren't good at all, sound very muffled and really loud. not happy and would not recommend buying this. this is my first melissa and doug toy....i've heard great things and am disappointed!"
3,Just ok,It would be ten times better if the darn puzzle wouldn't go off when I turned the lights off or on or sometimes even just walk by it. I ended up throwing the couple I had out!
3,Melissa & Doug Farm Sound Puzzle,Some of the animals did not make a sound. Granddaughter enjoyed playing with the puzzle but we could not hear sound from some of the animals.
2,Sound issues!,"Absolutely love Melissa and doug products!! Nicely made puzzle, my only issue is the sound. The animals don't even sound like animals and from the minute I opened this puzzle, the sound works on and off and most if the time, doesn't work. So disappointed but see from other site reviews, this is common problem. Hope they look to resolve these issues as their other products are of high standard!"
1,Should be removed from the market,"Fortunately, my daughter was able to remove the battery from this puzzle and disable the inappropriate sounds. For example, when you put down the cow the puzzle would oink. Not the usual quality of Melissa and Doug toys. A unique idea that is not well executed."
3,If you are looking for brainteasers...,"you will not find them in this book. It is not the kind of book you spend long times to figure out the answers. For example, for many pages in the first section, the author talks about ""this sentence is wrong"" type of paradoxes. I recommend ""aha! Insight"" if you are after brainteasers."
1,This book was awful,The main character was dreadful and lazy. I could not empathize with someone who was so entitled and boring. I just wanted to tell the Fiancee to run as far as he could. Very disappointing that I spent my time reading this. Now I know why it was in the bargain bin at the bookstore.
1,I can't even finish it...,"Maybe I'll finish reading this on a day where I feel like PUNCHING someone. The main character, Evie, constantly acts like the stereotypical PMSing crazy woman. Which would work if she knocked it off after a week, but she keeps. on. GOING.STOP!I don't know how anyone can relate to this woman. And if they can, boy am I glad I'm not friends with them!Too bad, because I really wanted to like this book!Also, she's so depressed for being a size 12?! Poor poor baby.Run, fictional Bruce! I'll never finish reading this book, for the hope that you magically run away!"
3,Pretty good book,Evie is determined to go from a size 12 or an 8 (Her fiance Bruce thinks she is fine the way she is)to fit in Vera Wang wedding dress by the day of her wedding. She ends up being so self-involved that she distances herself from friends and looses her job and Bruce while making bad choices. She needs to figure out what makes her happy and what she really wants.The book did have a few good laughs along the way.
1,Red Dress Ink Takes A Header,"Down ---- WAY DOWN. I have been really impressed with a lot of the RDI book lately but this one missed the mark. BY A MILE.... I found Evie completely unreadable. There was nothing redeemable or interesting about this book. I found myself picking it up - putting it down ---- thinking I hadn't given it a chance, and then realizing that I just couldn't get into it.I was really let down and mad that I spent real hard earned money on this. Big miss!!!!!!!!"
1,Terrible,"This is a standard-issue Red Dress Ink book--except for the fact that the herione is completely unlikeable. Why read about a whiny, dense, selfish, psychologically unstable twentysomething with no work ethic or sense of responsibility? One wonders what her man sees in her.Skip this one and pick up something by Isabel Wolff."
2,"Bleh, a disappointing RDI","This was a disappointing read. I had much higher expectations for this one as I've really enjoyed other RDI books. I found Evie to be whiny, self-centered and a rather disagreeable person. There was very little to draw me in to like about her at all. The characters all seemed flat and lifeless. I finished the book continually hoping that it would improve, but I never felt connected to it. The pace picked up for me about 3/4 through, but still not very engaging. I hope that others enjoy this one more than I did."
4,Good Dipiction of all the drama one goes through to get an accurate DX.,Good read and informative about the disease. Gives an accurate depiction of what a vasculitis patient goes through to finally reach a diagnosis.
5,You Must Read This Book!,"This woman is dear to my heart. She has lived through soooo much and has told all of us about it. She has made me see how blessed I am to have my life and I never take that for granted.Sheri has the courage and strength of many. She is a true and lovely spirit. I am so blessed to have her in my life. I am so blssed to have read this book.Buy it and read it, it will change your life!"
2,No Continuous Play,"I bought these DVD's to watch as I was recovering from surgery. I enjoy the Frasier shows very much. I rated this product low because these DVDs don't have an option to ""Play all episodes."" You can only play one episode, and when that episode is over, you have to hit Play again to run the next episode, and so forth. If I had known this, then I wouldn't have bought these."
3,Recipes for sucess - A different approach to getting things done,This book is written for everyone on the quest of gaining different approaches to writing a dissertation. For those of us who are not cooks it brings insightful information at a very readble level. Provides good source information and a realistic view to improve the dissertation journey. Recommended reading during the initial development of Chapters 1 and 2 and research development methods - serves as supplemental reading.
1,blech,"Wow how did something this badly acted, and a story with basically no plausibility get MADE?? Corny dialogue, story line full of holes, stereotypical characters, wooden delivery and a poorly botoxed actress- good only for a chuckle."
3,Worth a watch,I always like to find movies that are off the beaten trail. So this falls into that category. Probably worth a watch once. Not bad.
5,I love it,"It arrived on time, I was worried that maybe I might have made a mistake. But I put the ring on and I am diggin it. Everyone I've shown loves it."
4,Nice watch,"This is a fairly nice watch for the price. I've been having trouble setting the weekday. It is very picky about when you set the time. It's been a month, and I've yet to be successful at having it show an accurate weekday."
3,GUCCI Diamond Watch YA100509,"The diamonds on this watch are gorgeous, very good quality. However, the face is HUGE, and the watch was not running when I got it, so I returned it."
3,Not quite,"While there is some very scary information in this book about antibiotics and the creation of superbugs than can pass from one species (chickens)to another (humans), the somewhat embarrassing romantic dance between the heroine (who is, of course, tall and beautiful and smart) and a professor/expert witness gets in the way of the story. The good people in this book are very very good and the bad people are very very bad; there's no shading to the primary characters. Oddly, the secondary characters have more depth and are more believable--except, naturally--for the second-tier villains. A high level of predictability detracts from the story, but readers will definitely think twice before they eat their next piece of chicken."
1,"Normally I lover her books, this was so bad I didn't finsih.","My best girl friend and I can't wait for her books, but this one is so bad I am not sure she really wrote it. I did not even finish reading it. Hope, she redeems herself in the next one."
3,"enjoyable, but also a pain","This puppy has been reprinted and reprinted, a 1985 JAK that is one of her better early works. The characters are charming and the writing diamond brilliant, though I really really wanted to slap the female every once in a while, for she really bordered on silly. I mean her uncle said WAIT and what does she do?? She wants to go to Southeast Asia with a man she suspects is a rogue CIA agent??? OH PLEASE. Some intelligent needed. When she would go on and on arguing I really got tired of WAITING...and when she was almost kidnapped off the streets the day before, what did she do...walk a mile into town to get her car with boyfriend following all the way and she never was aware.Only JAK's bright righting kept this one from really sinking fast. I did like Adrian's character, but wish Sara was less of a dolt."
3,two and a half stars,"It didn't take me long to realize I was reading an old JAK. However, this was defintely one of her better early works. I actually liked the hero here - he was kind and considerate and it was totally understandable that he didn't want to tell Sara about his former life. My problem with this book was with Sara. What an idiot! Unfortunately, the plot was based on her acting like an idiot so I really didn't like the plot either. I think if Sara had been a normal JAK heroine and the plot reworked a bit, this could have been an excellent read."
2,Audiobook Review,"I listened to the audiobook recording of Jayne Ann Krentz's The Waiting Game and though the story itself was good I just wasn't happy with the reader she didn't change her voice for the different characters so it was hard at times to figure out who said what, I had to rewind the tape back a bit several times because I wasn't sure if it Was Sara or Adrian who was supposed to be talking and personally I like it when the reader makes his or her voice sound different for each character and since I didn't find this audiobook very entertaining it's not going to be one of my keepers! I definitely liked the plot though and I hope to buy the paperback book."
2,Will the real Jayne Ann Krentz please stand up?,"I have been, and still am, a fan of Jayne Ann Krentz; however, I really feel like JAK dropped the ball on this one. It started off with the promise of a good plot and an interesting story line, with intrigue, drama romance and mystery, but the book itself did not (to me) live up to Jayne Ann Krentz' actual potential. It all seemed flat throughout the entire book. The characters went through every thing like two paperdolls just going through the motions without any real feeling. There was no build up in the drama, and no mystery, and the conclusion was obvious, trite and went on longer than it needed.Everyone sometimes has an off-day, and I think this book was Jayne's."
3,Early effort,"Jayne Krentz wrote this early in her career as a writer. It's not as polished as her later efforts, and her characters aren't as well-developed."
4,Jewel Eyes,"The eyes of the Warrows come in various shades, some have specutlated they are in some way related to the giants that once roamed the world. Whatever the truth, they give them a decided edge in the demondark. They are even able to outsee the elves within its murky darkness.The story conitues to progress as the Warrows from behind the thornwall are taken from one extreme to another.AS I stated in my earlier review of book one, it is like Lord of the Rings in many ways. Still, it is enjoyable if you but give it a chance."
2,The title is somewhat misleading,"The title is misleading,for this is definately a beginner's book.The photos are excellent and the type set is large.But this is certainly not a professional's book!! If you're looking for an easy to read beginner's book this one is fine.I would never recommend this book for seasoned budgie keepers."
2,I sent it back...,"Spend a little bit more and buy Le Creuset. I have some Le Creuset cast irons pots/pans and they were worth every penny I paid. When I saw this one, I thought I would give it a try since it was a bit cheaper. Right from the start I just knew it didn't compare to my Le Crueset pot. For one... the inside finish isn't near as nice as the Le Crueset pots. The second thing I didn't like was the tiny handle on the lid. Because of the weight of the cast iron lid... if you are trying to pick up the lid it just seemed like a flimsy tiny handle to grab, especially if you have a silicon mit or hot pad over your hand. Whereas, the handle on the Le Creuset is much wider and easier to grab.Maybe if you didn't have anything to compare it to, or didn't want to splurge and buy Le Crueset, maybe this pot would be okay. But, I decided to send it back and buy me a larger Le Creuset pot even if it costs me a bit more."
3,The Twins' Mystery Teacher (Sweet Valley Kids),I sort-of liked this book. I sort-of liked it because it was funny and sort-of a mystery. I liked the part where their teacher passed out! That must have been scary.
3,Stop and Go,"This book makes several very interesting points, but gets very drawn out and preachy in between. This book can be split into 10 page segments where an idea with real merit is presented on the first page, and the next 9 pages just reiterate the same thing over and over."
2,Clearly she never traveled to any of the worlds dumps,"I used to believe her and others until I moved near Mexico. That nation doesn't have any environmental movements which are only found in the west. Outside of the tourist areas, Mexico is a diseased ridden, environmental disaster. The ghettos are very large and very poor. Whenever the come to America, they buy the largest trucks possible and then get the gas in Mexico which have no laws in how it is produced. Having lived in NYC and San Francisco, I've this trait in most immigrants. They feel no need to use trash cans as someone else will pick up the trash. Lastly, I am a member of Greenpeace and PETA so don't start with the name calling."
3,Better for Beginners,"I was dissapointed with this book. It covered a lot of material, but seemed to skim many subjects and didn't provide very helpful suggestions. Ideas were mainly things like ""avoid impulse purchases"" and ""look for discounts and sales."" I suppose if you wanted a basic guide about budgeting and an introduction to different types of investments, this book would be good. But if you are looking for something more in-depth, then keep on looking!"
2,"OK book, but not enough ""Robin Hood""ness for me","A Welsh retelling of the Robin Hood tale that really has absolutely nothing to do with Robin Hood of legend and tradition, not even in name. Bran is a spoiled, bratty prince who finds himself King and his kingdom invaded by cruel and greedy foreigners. Bran runs away into the woods and must come to terms with his responsibilities. Although a very well-written book with a lot of character potential (I especially like the character of Bran), this book is a 500-page beginning with no real plot, resolution, or drama. I might read the next books in this King Raven series, but I doubt it would be worth my time. There is little resemblance to Robin Hood, the spirit, the myth, the character (of which I am a big fan). It's a pretty boring book of a hero finding his way. If you want great Robin Hood, see BBC's new series or Robin of Sherwood. I'm still looking for a good novel, though. Grade: C+"
2,Disappointing,Lawhead is a well established author but seems to have lost either his ability to write grammatical English or the means to find a competent editor or both. The story and characterization are not strong enough to bear the weight of linguistic error.
2,Not Lawhead's best,"I have been a huge lawhead fan for a long time. But it's been a while since I read the first volume in one of his trilogies. I thought this was slow, uninspired and pointless. Of course you were left wanting more, but that's because nothing much happened in this volume. Let's hope the other 2 are better."
2,largely pointless,"The book is a decent adventure story, but despite my best effort I could not figure what is the point of retelling the well-known legend.Whatever original the author has to say, is best given in the afterword and one would be well advised just to read these few pages and skipthe rather tedious preceding few hundred pages of forced action. I gather the author found it exciting to surmise that Robin Hoodmight have been Welsh, but I for one could not care much about this historical footnote. What is the general point of the book escapes me entirely."
1,terrible choice of font,good story but the choice of a non standard font makes this book difficult ro read on a kindle
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"For some reason I couldn't fully enjoy Lawhead's writing style. There is little character development, very little action, and too many foreign names you have to keep track of. Another flaw that irked me was that none of the important places were listed on the map in the book. Some important battle would happen in Taryuk and I would be searching the tiny map in the front of the book for a full minute until shrugging and reading on. The only part that really spurred some attention out of me was at the very end of the book and consisted of 2 short chapters. I'm afraid I wont be continuing this Trilogy."
5,Amazing,This book had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning. Lawhead has done it again with this new book about Robin Hood. I have long been a fan of the Hood tale and this gives it new life and vigour from the same old story that everyone else had repeated.
5,Top of the list this year!,"I have just read this book this week: Hood. Lawhead is definately at the top of his game in this one. I'm starving to read the sequels. I enjoy historical fiction, especially either the ""wild wild west"" era or anywhere dating between 600AD-1400AD. I highly recommend it, it was a very refreshing break from all my ""study"" reading. And it was certainly entertaining enough to hook me in for reading 500+ pages in 1 week. I enjoyed reading Lawhead's KingArthur books when I was a kid. I rather liked Byzantium and Patrick, I thought the ""Song of Albion"" and ""Dragon King"" trilogies started well, but they didn't hold my interest well enough to finish them. I also enjoyed the ""Celtic Crusades"" series: despite the ""relic-worship"" and revolving around one of a million accountings of the Knights Templar."
4,Excellent twist on an old legend,"This book was better than I expected and I can't wait for Book 2 of the Trilogy!I especially enjoy historical fiction and this was no disappointment. The detail and intricacy were superb, yet the pace was fast enough to keep me reading deep into the night.Lawhead is a Christian author and this is categorized as ""Christian Fiction"", but it's certainly not theologically overbearing, nor is it trite like so much other Christian fiction."
4,The real Robin Hood?,"Who knows? Robin Hood set in 11th century Wales works for me though. Bran ap Brychan is a care free and nere-do-well son of a Welsh kinglet who in a few short and horrendous weeks is orphaned, cheated out of his ancestral kingdom, and thrust into a battle for his life and the iives or his subjects. The Normans have been in England for a little less than a generation and having conquered England set their eyes on Wales. Through treachery, political maneuvering, and conquest they are carving up the eastern portion of the only land left to the original inhabitiants of Britain. Will Bran grow up fast enough to make a difference or will he flee to safety and comfort in the north?As usual Stephen Lawhead delivers a gripping tale of heroism, moral crisis, and historical and mythical detail that dazzles the imagination. I loved how he wove familiar characters into the new setting bringing life to a story that has been done to death. I look forward to the sequal. 4.5 stars."
4,The same and yet not the same...,"Robin Hood is one of my favorite legends. I have read many re-tellings and this is one of the better books. The story moves along at a good pace and the characters are well developed. There are a lot of the same elements of the usual Robin Hood tales...Friar Tuck, Little John, Lady Marian, and Sir Guy. Aside from name changes, the main differences are that there is no Sherwood and no King Richard or Prince John. Instead we have the forest of the March and William II, or Red William, is king.Because of these differences, I almost felt like I was reading about a totally different person and had to keep reminding myself that this IS Robin Hood. That is why I only gave 4 stars. I guess I just missed good old Sherwood Forest. It's really an excellent book and I look forward to the second in the series.If you enjoyed this book, or think you might enjoy it, I recommend readingSherwoodby Parke Godwin."
4,An interesting version of a tale we all know,I quite enjoyed this re-telling of the Robin Hood legend. The story placed in Wales put a different spin on the legend by giving it a different historical background. It started a bit slow but the action increased. It was fun figuring out which character was which when comparing it to the better known version altho the characters weren't quite as well developed as I would have liked. This is not Errol Flynn in tights! It is a reasonably plausible explanation of the legend. I will read Scarlett...the follow-up book and I think Tuck has just been released. I expect the trilogy to be a good one.
4,Fantastic new take on Robin Hood,"This book washed away every preconcieved notion I had about Robin Hood, and replaced it with rich, intriguing characters and history from beginning to end. This is NOT the Robin Hood you grew up with. Between the fantastialy written characters and the well developed celtic mythology, this story comes alive, page after page, and leaves you begging for more."
4,4.5 stars,"I'm not sure what I expected when I asked for this book for Christmas, but I'm glad I did. This was a grown-up fairy tale on a story that we've heard a million times. This is an interesting twist on Robin Hood and how he (and his men) become who they are. I really liked this book and I can't wait for the second one!"
3,Overall Not Bad,"Overall not bad - the Alternate History version of this (with the Epilogue and Explanation) make this an interesting point of view for the Robin Hood myth beginnings. The story comes across as more History than Action Adventure, and that is where it falls flat for me. There is no excitement to me, only the story and I am being told everything. It is done Quite well, just not enough for me to continue this series."
2,It had so much potential,"I thought the idea behind this book was incredibly interesting and I absolutely love that it was set in Wales. That being said, it felt like Lawhead spent more time trying to develop the characters (which I can appreciate), but not enough time on the actual plot. There was so much potential, but it ended up really falling short. Based on this and reviews of the second book, I honestly have no interest in reading the next books, which is such a shame."
4,Lawhead books,Great different take on Robin Hood. Thoroughly enjoyed. Book arrived in great condition and promptly.
3,"Good book, but lousy ending","Stephan Lawhead is one of my favorite authors. I have enjoyed all of his books thus far. However, I was very disapointed in the ending of Hood.*spoiler warning*It seems that at the end, when Bran has finally realized who is and has the desire to step into that role, he just gives up the fight. He doesn't even really get the girl at the end. He takes Merian with him by force. She could have at least decided to go willingly instead of having to be tied to the saddle of her horse. And then it ends with a monastary being given some money and asked to pray for them everyday. I was very disappointed to say the least."
5,It's fixed,Got an engine check. Replaced with this item and the light is gone. Didn't do anything else...it cured by itself.
2,OK bang for buck,"This DVD was not great, but it was worth the price that Amazon charged me. FYI, the videos are each only about 35 minutes long. There is very little person to person interaction. What there is, is Femme to Femme. All in all, mediocre. I don't know if I will be ordering any more from the series."
4,wonderful,"The book can be cut to the last 30 pages, but they are worth twice the price.Make your lady a happy lady, Study up and you will be amazed."
4,Great guide and how to book,"This book was very complete and an excellent guide. A topic I thought I knew a lot about and I had some to learn. Creates a ""can do"" attitude. Well worth the price and time."
3,Nothing new,"There wasn't much in the book that I didn't already know. I would say it is a good book for someone who hasn't ever given a girl an orgasm, but for an experienced person, there is very little in the way of new information. The valuable information in this book could probably be condensed to 2 pages."
3,ok for linguists,"I found this book verging on the ridiculus in as much as the excercises that one is expected to do with the lips, tongue and jaw are similar to an oral marathon."
2,Disappointing.,"The famous ballet scene was omitted. They made Margeurite a nun which she never was, and it just doesn't work. Worst of all, they altered the original ending which depicted forgiveness and salvation (visually and in words and music)into a visually ghastly, gruesome scene totally inconsistent with the celestial music. Such changes to a masterpiece, whether it be a famous opera, as here, or to a Rembrandt cannot be justified, whether under a banner of ""creativity"" or any other."
5,Father in law gift,"Great watch for my Father-in-law. Casual enough to wear every day but also classy enough for dress, the two tone of gold and stainless steel is perfect. ""Dad"" loves the watch and wears it every day. Nice feature is that the day of the week is included along with the date. Highly recommend this watch for a man."
2,Not very good quality....disjointed and not very entertaining either,"I would not recommend this dvd (or its sister one either). The quality is average at best, and the song selection leaves a lot to be desired. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Just not very good, to be honest. The Montreal International Reggae Festival should send some scouts to the Reggae on the River festival, to get an idea of what a true reggae festival should look and sound like."
4,Great Read!!!!!,"This book is excellent, I read it in two days and if you knew me, that says something...."
2,Doesn't do Cole justice...,"Great songs, but the quality is terrible. You think they would try to re-master the recordings...nope, not here. They just put a bunch of old 78 sounding vinyl tracks onto a CD. Nothing more. Then they dress it up with a ""Platinum Collection"" title. With two discs you think you would get something nicer than that. Let's put it this way, these aren't definitive recordings. This CD is by some knock-off company which is apparently based out of London, England. Not only are the CDs bad, but there is a terrible write up about him. Just atrocious how the writer depicts Porter. Also, there are a ton of misspellings and some of the tracks aren't even right. For example the song ""Just One of Those Things"" is on the album credited as Frank Sinatra. The recording is definitely not Sinatra. It is a woman. So, bad quality recordings, bad quality write up= take a pass. I shouldn't even be giving this two stars, but Porter's song-writing is fantastic."
3,"Vile, Sick","I don't think Cole Porter's estate or the people who made these recordings have anything to do with this product. The liner notes contain an essay with some truly scurilous, slanderous, vulgar statements about Porter that will make your jaw drop."
3,Eclectic,"The range and diversity of the artists representer here are amazing. You get old, new, modern and contemporary all mized together.I get a kick out of you, done by Ethel Merman. COle himself does a few. Yup, eclectic it sure is..."
2,Bad Product,I got this product and it was a different color and I'm sending it back. This could be very bad if you're taking something that is not what you ordered.
4,Great invention.,"This is great, i made fish and had fishy smelling hands, used this and it went right away. Only con, I do not know weather to use this With regular hand soap also... nothing seems to be clear on that, i do and no complains. Nice little bowl rest holder type thing included. good buy, quick ship i would recommend this to any person."
2,So small and not nicely packaged,This was really to y and I was disappointed in the packaging. Meant to be gifts but embarrassed to give. Kept one in my kitchen.
4,quick & easy,"I was leery of not using adheasive of any kind, but follow the simple instructions and the visors lock in place firmly. It took longer to clean the foam tape left from the visors I was replacing."
5,Great.,I purchased for my truck at work. Easy to install and am truly happy. I have these on my personal vehicle and enjoy them.
3,"Decent information, poor presentation","I can't believe the authors are consultants who write for a living. This book has good information but suffers from redundancy, typographical errors, and uneven modernization between editions.I read this book straight through, and I think I read the same anecdote three times. There's some good advice buried in there along with some so-so advice, but the (minimum three) parenthetical passages (per page) make the text hard to read. Along with all the typos. (I had to laugh when they went on for several paragraphs about how proofreading is important because typos will ""torpedo"" a report to a client.)In places they emphasize the changes made in the newest edition, but it seems the end of the book didn't get as much attention to these changes. The section on computers is talking about tapes!This book also suffers from an over-focus on government contracting, a specialty of one of the authors."
2,"too long, too much repition","I believe that this book has good information for the independant consultant, from the professional just starting out to the seasoned veteran. I do believe that there is too musch repition and fluff. The information that I could personally use could have been stated in 150 pages."
1,Try to find a different tweezer...,"The ""Painless Plucker"" isn't painless and it isn't very good at ""plucking"" either. It looks fairly sophisticated... but it isn't. Too good to be true? Yes... If you're looking for a decent tweezer, the best I've found have diamond-coated tips... I strongly encourage you to find one of these instead."
3,Good,"Well made, and it works as advertised.Somewhat gimmicky in my opinion.User that this was purchased for is quite pleased with it.Recommended."
2,Hard to use,"I have not mastered this ""technique"" other reviewers wrote about.I keep grabbing skin, and cannot hold it right. When it works, it is less painful, but I cannot use it effectively. I hate tweezing anyway, so I have moved to professional threading method instead."
5,What drives the men that drive the machines,"This was an excellent work that captured very accurately not merely a dry collection of facts about the mechanicals of race cars of the 1969-72 era, or the various accouterments of auto racing, but it captures the gestalt, the feeling, the spirit of auto racing. I recommend it highly for not only the text, but for the photographs as well. The Speed Merchants seems to pack as much about the actual sport and the competitors as possible into this volume, and it seems to me that to remove even one sentence from the book would be to detract from the whole, so concise and yet well-done it is. If you can get a copy, please do so. If you are interested in what makes a race car driver tick (or tick over) this is the book to read."
5,Pure noir,"This film and its DVD treatment are superb. There's nothing left to say that hasn't already been said in great detail by other reviewers but as a classic film fanatic and a film noir junkie I cannot recommend this title enough. If you've seen and enjoyed 'Laura' and or 'Where the Sidewalk Ends', both also starring the breath-taking Gene Tierney and directed by Otto Preminger, have no hesitation in securing this DVD for your collection. The price is at least half what it's worth!"
2,The Whirlpool was a wash - sub par Fox Noir,"This to me was lacking, it just wasnt a magical atmospheric film noir like the others Fox has released.It didn't quick click despite the cast. Gene Tierney had a very bad haircut,and this time around she wasn't good in the acting department. Richard Conte didn't seem convincing to me as a psychotherapist and Jose Ferrer had a sleazy role but hypnotizing himself while he was sick so he could commit murder was a stretch for me. It is a murder mystery of sorts, but it is just lacking - it just didnt have the power films like Laura and I wake up screaming had Whirlpool really did not come across as a classic Noir..its not the worst but certainly not a great one either. Gene wasn't very good to look at and the movie wasnt very good to watch. See Laura instead."
5,The Tierney Magic,"The suspense is totally engrossing, and serves as a good example of Otto Preminger's mastery of the genre. Gene Tierney's performance is deeply moving as she plays the kleptomaniac spouse of a famous psychiatrist, Richard Conte, who falls into the clutches of a nefarious charlatan. The Tierney magic works at full potency as she emotes the conflicting thoughts and feelings that tear at her soul.Jose Ferrer as the sociopathic astrologer/hypnotist, is completely sinister as he cons, then blackmails, rich women in need of psychiatric help out of their fortunes. Whirlpool is a must for suspense freaks and film noir addicts. Reminiscing a bit about Laura, Otto Preminger created a point of rendezvous for past and future shades. Ironically, this film foreshadows the kind of desperate battle into which Gene Tierney will later be caught up in, as she fights to stay afloat in her own swirling torrent."
4,"OTTO PREMINGER, OPUS 14","***1/2 1949. WHIRLPOOL, based on the Guy Endore novel, was produced and directed by Otto Preminger. Ann Sutton, the wife of a well-known psychoanalyst, is kleptomaniac but doesn't dare to speak about it with her husband. She prefers to trust Dr. Korvo, a swindler who'll take advantage of her. Although this film is a minor entry in the filmography of Otto Preminger, it nevertheless delivers its share of pleasure to the curious movie lover. First of all, the performance of José Ferrer as David Korvo is really enjoyable, the character calling to our mind the souvenir of WaldoLaura (Fox Film Noir)Lydecker because of his cynical and venomous slickness. I also liked a lot the last scenes of WHIRLPOOL, though highly improbable, involving a self-hypnotized Korvo who's bleeding to death but still grinning. In summary, this DVD is a minor Preminger but a major addition to your library. Recommended."
3,"Not sure this is a noir, but...","Worth seeing for Jose Ferrar's performance as the oily ""hypnotist"" and womanizer. The film has Preminger's usual delight in the unsavoury and dark in human nature, but it also has Richard Conti rather miscast as a succesful California psychologist (kinda of like De Niro playing an Irish priest in ""True Confessions""...) Of course, Gene Tierney is pretty easy on the eyes, but the film is not really noir, more of a psychological thriller. Not a good place to start if your just getting into classic film noir, but a fine little film nevertheless. Pick this up after you have squeezed everything out of ""DOA"", ""Out of the Past"", ""Gun Crazy"" and ""Detour""..."
4,Good Thriller similar in many ways to Hitchcock's Spellbound,"This Otto Preminger film noir, starring Gene Tierney, is well acted, written and directed. It has already been available on DVD in the U.K. since Spring of 2004 with an acceptable transfer. If you liked psychoanalytical / melodramatic movies such as Alfred Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" you may enjoy this one."
3,Not Preminger's Best,"The best thing about this DVD is the quality and the commentary. When you listen to the commentary the film is much more interesting. Just watching it, well, it is not a very interesting or exciting film. I was curious because I had not heard of it or seen it. If I had seen it before, I may not have purchased it. Good performances."
2,Cute graphics not actually in the game.,"The cover art is great, but it does not make it into the game. The graphics that are in the game are pathetic, even for non-3D games. Uug!"
5,Best tasting Ginger candy Ever,"I found these about 6 years ago and have loved them ever since. They have the chewy of the original, with the spicy taste of ginger and the nuttiness of the peanut. Wonderful. I love the spiced apple as well, but over all these are my favorite."
5,Quick release stays out of my face,"I like this design because the large release handle is not in my face at the mic clip; it stays down at the top of the base tube. Works good, just a bit stiff. The release is not as smooth as other brands, but better design, because the release stays down out of camera view. This design does require using both hands to operate. The other design with a release at the top can be operated with one hand. I have both, like this better for close camera performances."
3,Not what I thought.,I guess I didn't read all the reviews so thought I could play Keno on this game. No way! You have to unlock a kazillion points - which are almost impossible to get - in order to unlock the next levels which include Keno. There is no way I'm capable of that. So. since I don't play cards that well... this was a terrible game for me to buy. ONLY 4 GAMES ARE IN THE BEGINNING PART.. and you have to unlock everything. What a terrible concept and not much fun.
5,A Magical Soundtrack,"I collect soundtracks, and in the past few years, Disney has had some great ones. My daughter likes to listen to this particular cd when she goes to bed. As a special edition cd, it also contains some tracks that are not actually in the movie, as well as makes some songs a little more 'politically' correct. How do I know this? I originally brought this soundtrack when it was first released way back when on cassette, and some songs have been altered/worded differently since. Its ok though, as with the re-release of the movie, they made the alterations there as well...Anywho, a good buy in my opinion."
1,NOT READABLE ON BOSE CD PLAYER,Put the cd in my Bose cd player and it says it's not readable. Not cool. Returning it might cost me more than the item. Doing it anyway because I'm that annoyed.
1,A Whole New World,"Where is the CD version with the remake of ""A Whole New World"" sung by Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey? It sounds so much better than the old original version. Not that Peabo and Regina didn't sound good, but it's 2005, it's more pop version with Nick and Jess!"
5,Awesome!,I've been thinking about getting an air intake for some time now and I'm glad I went with the K&N typhoon. I like how it is dual configured to be either a cold air intake or a short air ram intake. You don't really feel the additional HP but boy does it sound good. It seriously makes your engine rumble and I swear if you didn't know it sounds like you have a V8 under the hood. This is a definite buy if you are looking to purchase an air intake.
4,a great addition to any car,"This is a great product. I had it installed on an 05 Mazda 6 and it added new life to my car. performance was increased and it slightly increased fuel economy. The way it sounds is the best part, it adds an extra grumble to the engine that would match up perfectly with an aftermarket exhaust."
5,So exciting - Bravo Tenors!,"A totally awe inspiring live performance from the Three Irish Tenors. From beginning to end it's a joy to listen to. The voices sound great, the songs are magical from Irish to Opera, the arrangments are inspired. I feel like I'm there at their concert. Standing ovation from me. It's a must have!"
2,nude prostitutes,"""Nude Students"" infers young ladies, such as 18 years old (high school or college), but these 3 women pretending to be students appear to be no younger than mid to later 20's (or early 30's), and they don't look like students to me.....they look like prostitutes. Of the 3 ""students"", only one was worth looking at. I liked the scene in the locker room where they were jumping up and down naked with pom-poms.....pretending to be practicing for cheerleader tryouts, but that was only a few minutes of bouncing breasts (and one of the 3 ""students"" has fake breasts). The movie is supposed to a farce, they don't take themselves seriously. The other movie, ""Nude Teachers"" had a few prostitutes pretending to be teachers, and it wasn't worth watching."
3,GREAT MUSIC & SONGS......JUST BAD VOCAL MIX !!!!!!!!!!,"FIRST OF ALL , I AM A BIG DAVID T CHASTAIN FAN.....I OWN ALL OF HIS RECORDINGS... AND IT IS RARE THAT THE MIXING IS OFF ON HIS CDS. BUT THIS ONE YOU CAN HARDLY MAKE OUT THE WORDS , AS THE VOCAL MIX IS WAY UNDER THE REST OF THE BAND ???? ALSO THE ACTUAL SOUND QUALITY OF THE VOCALS IS NOT UP TO PAR AS WELL , ...VERY THIN ? ( RECORDED HERE AND MIXED IN GERMANY ? )THE LAST CD FROM CHASTAIN I PURCHASED WAS "" IN DEMENTIA"" AND IT WAS MIXED HERE IN THE STATES AND IT WAS MUCH BETTER....I WONDER WHY THEY SENT IT ALL THE WAY TO GERMANY TO MIX IT ????? ANYWAY..I LOVE THE MUSIC ON THIS DISC.....JUST PLEASE RE-MIX THE VOCALS AND MAKE THEM LITTLE LOUDER AND IT WILL BE MUCH BETTER !( PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS CD AFTER THE RE-MIX ) AND I WILL BUY IT AGAIN . THANKS , A CHASTAIN FAN."
4,Great compilation from a great label.,"Bam Caruso were one of the pioneering reissue labels before (largely) disappearing in the late nineties. This CD culls various material from their (seemingly unending!) releases, and manages to be one of those record label samplers that surprises with its quality.To be sure, there's an awful lot of stuff that isn't represented, with Bam's compilations (especially Rubble and Circus Days) being largely ignored. But some of the treasures unearthed are remarkable, with the absolute jaw-drop-inducing gem probably being And One Day, from the Left Banke's never-released-on-CD reunion album. My god, I had no idea that this track could sound this *good*.Record label samplers are often a mixed bag, but with Bam Caruso, it's pretty hard to go wrong."
3,Only one track really stands out...,"I only bought this CD for the reissue of The Left Banke's ""And One Day"" which is completely stellar and stands out from the rest of the songs on this CD.I was not impressed with the other songs. The first two tracks are simply awful, others are kind of ok, but nothing special. The booklet is of nice quality and has some cool info about the bands in it.If you are a fan of garage/psych rock, which I am not, you will probably like this CD. In my opinion though, Bam Caruso would have been better off just reissuing the entire Strangers On A Train aka Voices Calling LP from The Left Banke and then just adding some bonus tracks."
5,excellent scholarship and beautiful photos,"Having become interested recently in the art of Chinese scholar's rocks, I found it difficult to find much literature on the topic. What a wonderful delight it was to discover this book! As a catalogue for the collection and a scholarly examination of the many aspects of these stones, my appreciation and knowledge of the art has risen dramatically. The essays are thorough and well-written, and the photos are almost as good as the real thing. Having seen some of these pieces in museums, but knowing very little about them and their histories, it was enlightening to get such vast amounts of information on each piece in the catalogue. I encourage anyone who is interested in these stones to give it a try."
2,Unorganized and outdated,"This book has some good points, but it is poorly organized. There is alot of fluff and psychobabble that detracts from the message of the author. The only thing I came away with from this book was that friends and family can make you lean towards divorce in that they want you to be happy and sometimes reinforce separating or divorce inadvertently."
3,"Okay, let's try this","Yes, counselors tell women to find themselves when they are not trying to seduce us themselves. Our friends think dunping on our man is supportive. No one even suggest counseling together. So read this, and for a happy ending read Ken Agori's Defenders of the Holy Grail!!"
5,A better understanding of why relationships work or do not.,"This book has explained in an intelligent manner why some relationships struggle. It gives an honest and sometimes brutal opinion of people. I was surprised to find out that the way family and friends react can impact and even help destroy a marriage. My wife left me and I know she was supported through this when her friends could have pushed her to get help. Instead, they told her things would be okay without giving her reasons why things would be okay. They were there for her for themselves. Dont get me wrong, I accept my responsibility for our struggles 50-50 but did not get a chance to fix my marriage soon enough. I still have some hope. If your marriage is struggling read this and have your spouse read this. Have your family read this. Dont let anyone impact your marriage without some intelligent thought behind their words."
4,This book has helped me,"I have been able to really learn a great deal about how others in my life affect my relationship. I also have been able to put into words what I was feeling - my husband read it but felt it was just too conservative and didn't really support all the reasons to stay married, but it did get us talking. It made me feel I wasn't crazy to try to stay married - and that for anyone to consider a divorce without truly trying to work things out is a big cop out."
3,Not My Susan Wiggs Favorite,"I love Susan Wiggs! My first Susan Wiggs book was The Charm School and I was blown away! I loved it, I actually fell inlove with the hero! From then on, I was a fan of Ms. Wiggs! I've read The Drifter and liked it a lot, Firebrand was great as well! I'm not too sure with this one...I realized I was more interested in the secondary characters, like Lucas and June Li, what a great story line for them! I'm always looking for historical romances in different cultures and would have loved to read more about these two! Unfortunately, that's when I knew the story of Blue and Isabel was boring compared to the other two. I'm dying to read more about Lucas and June!! Please, Ms. Wiggs, write more about them!!!"
4,A captivating love story--,"Isabel and Blue's story was very entertaining. However, I wished we would have heard more about Isabel and how she came to be a woman on the run from her past. We never really knew what happened to her. Blue was a wonderful hero with witty dialogue and it was very romantic how they fell in love. All in all, it's definitely worth the read."
3,What can I say?,There isn't much I can say about this book it was wonderful to read and very entertaining the heroine was likeable but to me Isabel seemed to be missing something. she didn't seem real for some reason I can't explain and Blue is great except he was always mad or grumbling about something or other. It's an enjoyable book but it left me expecting more. I recomend you read it and find out for yourself if you like it or not but it left me with mixed feelings.
3,A Summer's read.,"This was a fairly interesting story. Interesting in that Blue and Isabel met in an unusual way in 19th century San Francisco. Isabel was an interesting character in that she was alone as a single woman in that time and making a way for herself in the world despite a terrible past.Lucas was deep and withdrawn and wanted Blue's good opinion. It was interesting to note that his father thought Lucas should have know he loved him by the mere fact he was his son, but Blue had a difficult time voicing his love and approval of his own son whom he loved deeply.This was not as good as some of her books but it's a quick read and enjoyable."
4,I enjoyed this book!,"This is my third Susan Wiggs and although not my favorite it was worth buying and reading. What really brought out the book for me was the character of Isabel. This tortured heroine was strong and brave even when bad things were happening around her. She makes the story. I also liked Blue, but I wished Susan didn't have the second story line with Blue's son and the girl he liked just because it look away from the romance of Blue and Isabel. I also wished there was an epliogue, but there wasn't. If you like this book you should read The Drifter and The Hostage by this author."
5,Susan Wiggs,"A good novel, well written.When looking for something easy to read and pleasurable you can't go wrong with Susan Wiggs!!!"
2,You get what you give....,"I got these H4 bulbs pretty cheap... at around 20 bucks.I bought them mostly out of curiosity because I had never seen this ""NOKYA"" brand before, and because the so-called ""7000 Kelvin"" caught my attention.Well what can I say... the bulbs DO look really white, but the illumination power leaves much to be desired.If you drive around in the city, where external light sources illuminate the street at night, you'll feel these lights fade out, and won't even notice them. Even standard, plain vanilla, factory yellow bulbs are more noticeable in city streets. Also, the reach of these lights is very limited.You'll have to be outdoors on a completely dark road to notice their potential. But in the city.... on word: WEAK."
4,Great to have in your bag of tricks,"I bought these adapters to keep in the sound ""tool box"" and they work great. Priced reasonably and arrived quickly. Have used them several times and have had no problems at all."
3,Took 11 days to arrive,The adapter is solid and at a good price. But don't order it if you're in a hurry. It took 11 days to arrive.
1,One star is being generous...,"This book is not worth the effort or the price. The history is shallow and doesn't tie at all into the author's tales of her childhood. There is just this abrupt shift from history to personal life story with no linkage whatsoever. Wierd! Her descriptions of life growing up in Hawaii are even more shallow than her historical chapters. She gets facts wrong. (Okolehao is brewed from the ti plant, not pineapple, for example.)Moore exhibits limited knowledge of the islands and their people. Maybe she suffers from failing memory, given that she moved away from Hawaii so long ago. However, I suspect she wasn't really paying attention as she was growing up. (One of my friends tells me she was focused on being one of the cool kids in school.) I say all this as a life-long resident of Hawaii who grew up in Hawaii at about the same time she did. On top of everything else Moore's writing is contrived. Don't waste your money."
2,thin fluff,"The book is thin fluff. One of the author's '64 Punahou classmates, Laurie Ames Birnsteel, has written a more authentic and satisfying memoir, *Kahala: Growing Up in Hawaii*"
4,A Look Beneath the Surface,"The typical one-week trip to Hawaii involves an immersion in lovely sights and scents and leads to a vague realization that this is a very different place from the rest of the United States. If one is lucky enough to spend a month or more then you begin to get an inkling that this is a very complex place indeed. For those who want to have a deeper inderstanding of that complexity this book is highly recommended.Susanna Moore , who grew up in Hawaii, nicely blends a short history of the islands with her own experiences going to school there while slowly becoming aware of the ""sociology"" class going on all around her. For those who want to develop a Hawaiian sense of place this short straightforward book is a good place to begin."
3,Good but....,"The book is not bad and does an ok job on how to use the GUI. What it really needs to do is tech how to develop batch files. This is more useful, allows a great degree of freedom, and helps to keep the garbage in garbage out mantra from being applied."
4,Finite Element Analysis: Theory and Applications with ANSYS,This is a basis book for Finite Element Analysis. Also buy a book in Amazon is a fantastic guarantee of service.
2,"Good intro, but does not go far enough","I bought this book hoping it would make my job of developing a finite element model using ANSYS easier. But I did not learn much of anything new from this book. I was already familiar with finite element theory and also took the intro to ansys course offered by ANSYS. I had hoped that this book would go beyond what was offered by these two sources, but sadly it does not. Still, for the beginner who knows next to nothing of f.e. methods and ANSYS this is probably helpful."
4,"Showing it's age, but still a must-have for students of technical communication","I'm a graduate student halfway through a Master's program in Technical Communication, and this was a required textbook for one of the program's core classes. I definitely won't be reselling this one; I was surprised at how many articles in the book I had seen referenced elsewhere. While some of the articles are a bit wordy and dense, and are getting a bit dated, I think this book will be an important resource for my future classes. Looking forward to the sequel!"
4,Good Introduction to the Field,"For academics either in or entering the technical/professional writing field, this book offers a comprehensive review of the field via articles written by canonical experts within it."
4,"Definitely did the job, and its a keeper","Reading this book and taking careful notes took my score from 38% to the 80/90% range. I am convinced this book is the reason I passed the exam. It would have been helpful to have access to a machine to ""play with"", especially the openboot commands, but one might get by without it if he/she has enough prior hands-on experience. I am definitely going to keep this book as a reference, and I have placed my order for Part II already. The author was helpful when contacted regarding the texts."
3,I got me a pass...,"First time I took the exam I winged it and failed, bought this book then passed. The subject matter doesn't hold up by itself, it is a good starting point to head onto Answerbooks & man pages. The sample questions were very useful, it tells you the correct answer when you get one wrong (something you really don't get from a Sylvan test). The big problem with the questions were what was missing - no questions on either lp or CDE, both heavily focussed on in my tests (10-15 questions."
3,is it enough?,"It can match the objective of the exam, however it does not contain enough materials for you to pass the exam.I think if you are beginner to Solaris, don't just read this book for preparing the exam, you must supplement with other books, such as A Practical to Solaris - highly recommend."
3,"I like it so much, I'll buy PartII also...","If you know NO Solaris and read this entire book and review with the practice questions in the CD you'll SHOULD pass the certification exam.It's my opinion that the some of the material is not covered thoroughly. Hence, reading this book in conjunction with exercising on a machine is higly recommended."
5,Must have if you study for certification!!!!!,"This is the best book I have seen in order to get well prepared for the certification test part I. I think the price should be double because the CD which comes along with the book is as valuable as the book itself. If you are planning to take the test read the book and then take the practice exam from the CD ROM until answering the questions doesn't make you think anymore. Taking the real exam will be a lough und you feel ""at home"" while taking the exam. I am very much looking forward to part II from which I know Bill is working on it at this very moment."
1,Horrible After Sale Service on Defective Product.,"I hope you get a good one the first time. Mine had a horrible squeal out of the box turned grind after the first month. Even after following all their process to send back the label on the motor, by registered mail on my dime to make sure they got it, no reply. Countless emails and letters. They just care about the sale. There is no after sale service or standing behind the product after that. There are only 2 units left in stock. I'm sure not one of them are the replacement inducer I need. Thanks for leaving us and the kids in the cold winter months KTOOL!!! Furnace doesn't run without an inducer motor."
4,Fasco Furnace Draft Inducer,We are very satisfied with this item. The installation was user friendly and the item is working like a charm. Couldn't ask for better.
5,fasco draft inducerinstalled late in the heating season,installed late in heating season. did not get much use.seem to work as should.will no more after next heating season.
5,GOOD QUALITY SERVICE A++,"GOOD BATTERY WORKS GREAT ITS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ,ITS BIGGER AND AT A CHEAPER PRICE..IM VERY HAPPY WITH IT"
3,Looks nice...,"Looks nice, however, the elastic strap may drop a radio if you have to get physical (or climb a fence)."
4,Excellent mood music,The titles on track Nos. 9 & 10 are transposed - they have each other's titles. Why am I posting this is a review?Because AMAZON HAS NO MECHANISM FOR TELLING THEM when they have made a mistake.
5,i was a student,"Doug Brown was a professor of mine in college for comparative economics. his book ""insatiable is not sustainable"" is an awesome book that will definitely change one's perception about our culture of material-slavery. we had to read the book as a part of curriculum for the class and regretfully, i resold my copy back to the book store. (in order to make a quick buck). ironic and moronic because i resold it in order to perpetuate my insatiability... i highly recommend and have quoted it or referenced it many a' times since i've read it in college. i am searching for a cheap replacement and for those of you whom are interested in this book, i highly recommend it."
3,Hard- Core Scifi/ Horror Buffs Only!,"This is pure b=grade sci-fi/ horror. If you like that sort of thing, you'll love this film. If not, you'll hate it.The film concerns a young college student who is unwittingly a part of a ""mad doctor's"" experiment that is intended to transform him into a snake. This film uses lots of real snakes, some of them very dangerous. There are some moments that are very unnerving. One of them is when we meet one of the doctor's failed experiments: a half-man, half- snake mutation without arms or legs that is placed in a carnival side-show. Creepy stuff!The downside is the film's acting and goofy 70's fashion. The most annoying part of the film for me was Heather Menzies, who plays the Doctor's daughter. Her hair style and glasses are goofy-looking even by the standards of the 1970's and she can't act. Worse still, the movie's most inane lines of dialog belong to her.Even still, I recommend it to the dedicated fan of horror/ sci-fi!"
5,a master piece of horror,"Ssssss is a master piece of horror of the the 70'. It would be fair to rediscover it and to rate it at the top. Both frightening and moving, the film refers in many ways to classics Freaks and Frankenstein and deals with the part of animality in human beings.I highly recommend it to monsters and mad scientists lovers.From a French fan."
3,Sssssilly But Fun!,"A relic from the 70s, SSSSSS is one of those mad scientist movies where the doctor's intentions may seem humane, but the results grossly horrifying. Veteran character actor Strother Martin had probably his only starring role as the gentle herpetologist who wants to create the next step in man's evolution----snakes!Dirk Benedict (BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THE A-TEAM) is the all-American boy who volunteers to help Martin, not knowing the doctor's real intentions. Heather Menzies (LOGAN'S RUN) is his nerdish daughter; Reb Brown is the jock whose bad attitude dooms him.While the make up effects are pretty shoddy by today's standards, the real snakes are pretty creepy and the whole thing is enjoyable in a guilty fashion. Ssssssoo sit back and have some fun."
2,The ending ruined it for me,"I must admit, watching it the first time wasn't that bad (until the end). He's turning into what we think is going to be some kind of gigantic snake...who knows. But the end comes along and it's just some regular size snake slithering around and the lady screams? Each S in the title stands for Stinker."
4,Good Horror Film Suffers from Poor Ending,"I love to read reviews of this film. They will ultimately wind up saying: ""IT'S TOO UNBELIEVABLE!!!"" Hey, this is a horror film! Was Frankenstein, Dracula, or the Wolfman unbelievable??Anyway, this flick is head and shoulders above the typical fare in terms of acting, direction, dialogue and most of the effects.The plot is simple: a mad scientist tries to turn a young man into a snake. The interesting wrinkle is that his daughter happens to be in love with the guy.Instead of complaining about the weak ending, I've thought of a much better ending. (...)!"
4,"Campy, Creepy and Wonderful","Yes, Ssssssss will never be considered one of the ""great"" lost 70s films, but it is a lot of fun to watch. The plot (almost scene for scene) was appropriated by Full Moon to make Curse of the Puppetmaster, so campy is definitely the word to use here. The craze of the time of skinny dipping is done here and the hair styles and slang are oh so 70s. The chiller is effective though, especially at the end. The carnival sideshow adds chills effectively, as well. This would make a GREAT DVD double feature with Race with the Devil. C'mon studios!"
4,"Red touch black,my friend Jack, red touch yellow will kill a fellow!","This is a classic mad scientist movie. Strother Martin is a herpetologist who thinks people would be better off as reptiles. Enter Dirk Benedict,prototypical clueless guinea pig, who falls for the over protective mad scientist's cute daughter. The rest of the story tells itself.SSSS makes up in suspense, creepiness and b-movie star power what it lacks in production values. Strother Martin is a classic 2nd string villain. Dirk Benedict, you might remember him from Battlestar or A-Team. And the female lead,Heather Menzies, played one of the Von Trapps in the Sound of Music. She was also in Captain America with Reb Brown,who has a small part in this movie too! Nope, this movie came from a time when FX were cheap, shaky and down played but the movie was fun and exciting none the less. Vintage 70's shoestring horror."
2,A campy movie,"This movie is truely bad, but it is also a good movie to watch when there is nothing else on. The bad acting, terrable efects, and no plot combine to make this a rather funny movie."
1,It was an awful movie.,"This movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The acting was bad, there was a weak plot, and it was incredibly boring. The only good thing about thus movie was that there was no sequel."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This bit of something from my childhood has not aged well at all. Only Strother Martin seems to be enjoying himself and the story is really the pits. It seems that Strother wants to change a man into a king Cobra(who knows why) and Dirk(The A-Team) Benedict is elected.Like I said this is one that should have stayed in my past, as it just doesn't work for me anymore."
3,Sssssss,"An eccentric herpetologist enlists the help of a college student to assist in his snake research, but the daily doses of 'anti-venom' that he has been administering to his star pupil begin to turn the boy into a slithering serpent! Anyone with a fear of snakes, beware! SSSSSSS boasts an array of live snakes that the actors handle, including the deadly King Cobra. It is impossible to take the film completely seriously, but thankfully the even blend of comedy, horror, and romance give the quirky characters and silly plot plenty of room to breath. Like Willard and Stanley before him, Dr. Martin uses his fanged friends to exact revenge against his trespassers, which provides a decent little body count as the snakes bite and crush their way through the locals. Unfortunately, the final creature design fails to impress because of its aged make-up and special FX, but SSSSSSS still manages to be an entertaining killer animal entry from the early 70's!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
4,Snakes to be feared.,"My husband and I saw this years ago and enjoyed seeing it again. It may not be a block buster, but it is worth seeing."
4,classic cheesy movies,"If you like the 50's horror classics or cheesy 70's (but well made) B movies, this is a good one. I've always been a Strother Martin fan. Great around Halloween time. Scared me to death when I was a kid. Now I enjoy seeing it once a year. Special effects for the time are good. Get the popcorn and enjoy an old drive-in movie!"
3,It's ok,It's not ATHF but close. Still pretty funny but I didn't think as funny as the original. I don't think I'm going to purchase anymore but is watch them if they were in prime
2,I am disappointed.,"Look - I f***ing love this show. I have been watching it since it first aired. But I have to be honest - this was not a good season (ok, there were a FEW scenes). It was very dry in humor...too dry. Sometimes to the point where you are actually bored watching it. That made me sad, because as I said - I love the show. It was a present for my friend, and we watched it together. He is a huge fan too. We were both disappointed. If you are a collector, then go ahead and buy it. It's just not very entertaining...."
5,"Immature, pointless, and so entertaining","Although the show has taken a slide since about 5th season, it is still far more entertaining and oddly intelligent. Much more entertaining than any reality TV show!"
4,Nothing ever really changes...,"First, for anyone confused, this is just Aqua Teen Hunger Force with a new title and opening credits.Why change the title and opening after 8 years on the air? (And occasionally claim the show isnow set in Seattle?) In the anarchic spirit of the show, why not?While not up to the best of the early seasons, with only a couple of 'classic' episodes among of the 17on the two discs, this still has plenty of surreally, sometimes stupidly funny moments.Sophomoric, gross at times, sure. But that doesn't mean it can't also be very funny, and inventively weird.Glad to see they returned to a two disc format, after the skimpy single disc 'best of' that was the lastcollection. However, there's still only 1 extra, compared to the usually copious extrasin the early years of the series."
1,Not all vitamins are equal,"And these are some of the worst offenders. Not just the V D's here, but any of them. For starters, you can get Thorne 5000 IU vitamin D's for only a dollar more. And they digest and absorb so much better. When I first started vitamins I didn't know any different and got these from the drugstore. Days after, I started noticing my body putting off an odor, and (not to be too personal) but they gave me bad bad gas. Stopped taking them, all symptoms stopped. Went to a natural products store, they introduced me to Thorne and New Chapter, and life's been good ever since. You get what you pay for here. A cheap and inferior substitute to vitamins that will actually do you some good without adverse effects."
5,If you can't take big pills.,I have a hard time taking supplements because I am bad at taking pills at all. Also I did take the oil version but it made me sick.I tried these and found that if you chew them they don't taste bad at all and can be broken up easily with no bad after taste. They are perfect for me and don't make me ill. I can take them on the run and just need a swig of water.
5,Vitamin D,I cannot believe how much better I feel since I started taking 1000 IU/day of Vitamin D. It took a couple of weeks to really feel the difference - but wow!
1,Beware of allergic reaction.,"I bought this for my mom, and almost got her sent to emergency room.She had experienced skin rash, swelling on face and limbs after first pill.On the other hand, she didn't have any problem with the Nature Made Vitamin D-3, 2000IU, 90 Softgels."
1,Need dimensions,Does this product listing say somewhere the width and length of the roll? I couldn't find it. Without that it's not useful at all.
4,Refresher from an Old Rally'er,"Now that I'm retired, I have a bit more time on my hands and wanted to get backto a fun car sport that I participated in as a young man in my 20's. Except thatI don't have the memory of a 20 year old. The Road Rally Handbook was amarvelous refresher course."
3,Good but not great - doesn't work with other doorbells,"I got this doorbell to replace a standard doorbell on the top floor of my house. It turns out that because you must place a diode across the switch/button, my functioning doorbell in the lower floor no longer worked, but was always stuck half on, buzzing and vibrating.I replaced the doorbell with a second of these musical doorbells and the two work fine together.There's a huge selection of tunes, but the speaker is sub-par and they sound pretty blurry at any but the lowest volume settings."
4,Nice doorbell,"I love musical doorbells, much better than the standard boring bells. This was is easy to install. I wished it had a better selectin of music though and the doorbell that you attach outside has falled off a few times. Other than that, well worth the price."
5,Musical Doorbell,Thank you for my musical doorbell. Been looking for one for such a long time. For the buy it's not bad but I must say I was stupid for not purchasing there model that you can install you own music threw an Ipod. Oh well maybe my next house. lols. Thanks again.
3,"Good flexibility, OK sound quality, tricky installation","Positives: Good variety of tunes, and the chime is loud enough to be hear throughout a good-sized house. The sound quality is not great, but is OK for a small speaker in a plastic housing.Negative: When you install the chime, you have to install a diode at the button. If the chime doesn't work, you have to work through all possible combinations of diode orientation and chime wiring until it rings. With two possible wiring orientations for the diode and two possible wiring orientations at the chime, there are four combinations to work through. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but a pain when every trial involves getting up and down ladders, running up and down stairs, unscrewing things, listening for results, etc. I guess this is inherent in their design, but I wish they'd found a way to install and troubleshoot without having to run through all combinations."
4,Fun doorbell!,"This is so much fun, my kids can't wait for someone to ring the doorbell. This bell has so many choices plus you can make your own. My only issue with this bell is that it isn't super loud"
3,Ringing the bell,"It is a compact size musical doorbell and has a good size of selection for musical tunes.While it's serving the purpose, the harmony, however, at times, tends to be a li'l off."
2,Far Less Than We Had Hoped,"This doorbell/door chime arrived well packaged. The installation instructions were poor; a picture of the actual positioning of the terminals would have been better than the schematic given. After fiddling/rewiring the wires, doorbell, diode, etc., I finally got the appropriate sounds from it. However, there are several things that need improvement. The female voice that tells what group of tunes is selected reminds me of what would pass for a drill sergeant, certainly not soft and/or pleasant. The volume control should be labled ""loud"", ""louder"", ""loudest"", and ""wake the neighbors"". Finally, the sounds that the chime makes are very mechanical; not melodic at all. I wish I had bought another Heath/Zenith Hardwired Multi-Tune Chime; even though that failed and I was replacing it."
1,expensive stroller,"I just bought a EuroTrend Sport stroller (by Baby Trend, which is an exclusive Toys R Us/ Babies R Us brand), and it is IDENTICAL to the Maclaren, at almost a third the price ($50). Honestly, why would you pay for the Maclaren with that kind of competition? Great European engineering... great American pricing!"
3,SEAN PAUL A LICK NUFF,tro sean paul you do a good job pan di album. gwan man. But where back off deh. you cant leave out dem a tune yah. and why you put so much skit pan the album. you could of drop dem de. ALRIGHT NUFF RESPECT.
4,never heard reggae before this,This albumn was my first reggae albumn and i'm glad I bought it. I would reccomend this to someone who has never really heard reggae before. The only bad thing was the multiple skits but other than that it was good.
2,Uneven,"LA studio monsters get together for a mishmash of fuzak and R&B; .I respect all of the artists on the album,but there is way too much GRP fuzak influence on this thing.Alex Ligertwood has dynamite vocal chops and does a nice cover of Josie,but most of the rest of the stuff is ""quiet storm"" elevator product.In fact,it reminds me of Stuff.This is album is to jazz as white zinfandel is to wine.Blended for the pseudo hip."
4,What's not to like,"Easy to install, bolt the main unit together first. Car feels faster, sounds better without being intrusive. Love it. Put one on before cat-back."
2,"Lots of promise, little content","I was excited to finally find a book which really addresses the gaping holes of NT-out-of-the-box-security especially in an Internet environment. I pitty the company who's NT sysadmin has to read this book to get up to scratch. There's nothing in this book you can't find on the net in much more detail. Edwards has a very pleasant writing style, but to really cover this topic his book would need 5000 pages."
5,A very excellent book,I have a library full of NT books. Mark Joseph Edwards writing style and his down-to-earth explanations gave me the answers and steps I needed to getting started with NT. I highly recommend this book as a first book for any NT beginner. Follow it from page 1 to the end and you will do just fine. Well worth money!
3,"In the end, we bought something else","My husband and I were in the market for a new umbrella stroller and this was the one that I had wanted for a while. My son is 15 months (33 inches, 26 pounds)and even with the shoulder straps at their tightest he was still able to wiggle out of them. I was so disappointed because we had the same problem with our other umbrella. I LOVED the design, sleekness, and weight of the Maclaren but in the end I was not confident that my son was secure. Had I been able to make the straps tighter I would have sefinately bought this stoller."
4,A great stroller!,"This is a good looking stroller, light weight yet sturdy, very easy to maneuver, we love it. My 3 year old boy now can take a good nap on it, but I wish it had a shoulder strap and a cup holder then it would be perfect."
4,"Easy to use, no access to basket",This stroller is lightweight and easy to fold/unfold (once you get used to the mechanism). There is very little access to the basket though which i find annoying when i go shopping. I really can't get anything in there when the baby is in it.Stroller offers a smooth ride and is easy to maneuver.
3,They'll work for what I'm looking for but...,"I bought four of these report covers because I'm just starting college and I want to make a good impression. I'm sure they'll work fine (I don't know because I haven't started quite yet), but they were mildly bent and slightly worn when I received them. It's not a big deal since it's barely noticeable, so I'm not going to request a return for the items, but that just kind of annoyed me. So, this is a good solution if you're on a tight budget, but if you can afford to spend a few extra dollars on report covers, do that!"
3,Not really a necessity for learning,"For history it's fine, although rather expensive. Her other book ""Shibori"" was all you really need."
3,"Beautiful pictures, not for instructions",I was hoping for more instructions on how to create shibori pieces...this is not the book for that.
1,Disappointment,"match wise it looks like anther WWE dud; Plus Pipper just won the tag title with Flair, wow that is good timing! Not really"
3,A Good but not great WWE DVD Set,"The first disc of this set is great but the other two are at only fair. When I originally purchased it I thought it would be like the Hulk Hogan DVD Set, but that is not the case. Th complete History of Roddy Piper was done on 1 DVD then the other two dvds finish a few decent matches, but spends way too much time in Pipers Pit. If you did not care for the Pipers Pit segment, then do not purchase unless it is cheap.I was actually disappointed that WWE could not have produced a better DVD set, considering Piper was one of My favorite wrestlers."
4,Good,"Documentary on Pipper was good and I didnt really have a problem with it. The matches are a mixed bag. The Valentine and Hart match are worth watching and probably his best matches. Pipper Pits? Of course its worth it for that. I enjoyed the dvd for the documentary and Pipper Pits. The matches are alright but besides the two I stated earlier, nothing speical."
4,Where's the Georgia Footage!,"This is a good DVD, the reason I'm only giving it three stars is the inexcusable complete lack of his color commentary with Gordon Solie and his classic feuds with Bob Armstrong, Tommy Rich and Dick Slater among others in his Georgia Championship Wrestling days, Oh well, I guess I'll have to dig out my old VHS tapes of GCW. Memo to Vince, Piper did have a career before the WWE, how about another DVD set of his early days in Portland, Mid Atlantic, and Georgia?"
2,"No Piper Vs. Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka? What gives?","Why are there no Snuka Vs. Piper matches on this? That was one of Rowdy Roddy's best feuds of all time. I'm sure this will include the infamous Piper's Pit w/ the Superfly, but they went on to have some good battles after that-why not give us those as well?. Other than that, this seems like a good set. Guess we'll have to dig up those old 80's vhs tapes.""1 coconut...2 coconut...3 coconut""-Roddy Piper '84(LOL)"
2,disappointed,"It was not music I really enjoyed, the reviews looks good, but I don't use this CD much."
5,Amazing...,"This book contains drawings, accurate descriptions,advice and various techniques for building amazing and unique art projects. I have used it for many years and I am looking to buy another copy as a gift for a friend. If you have a project that you want to build with a community,for yourself or with your family,this book will show you the way to do it. It has detailed information on Stiltwalking,shadow and giant puppetry building and will unlock the creative potential in anyone. I can't recommend it enough."
3,"easy enough to read, but nothing special","I started this one not knowing that it was somewhere it the middle of a series. I have to admit that it got a little complicated in places, so it probably would have helped to start at the beginning. I did enjoy the basic plot line about Rod and Gwen. Rod is the High Warlock of Gramarye, but he comes from another place and time. It is his wife and kids who have the real magical talent. His son goes missing and Rod sets off to find him and is trapped in a distant part of the land. He is soon joined by his family and must make his way back home.I don't know that I would go out of my way to find any more books by this author, but I might read more if I happened to come across one.CMB"
2,Don't bother,"Tape is maybe a bit too delicate, as I have routinely had problems getting it to stick to my walls. It and its cousins don't work well for brush painting anyway, unless you're an extremely sloppy painter. I always get paint to work its way under the tape - it's cheaper and quicker to ditch the tape and freehand edges. Maybe it does ok for spray paints. I will say it does work well for masking caulk, when you can get it to stick, of course."
5,confused,"I am wondering, is this the original Saiyuki or is it all of them including gunlock and reload?"
3,No Extras,"Saiyuki is one of my favorite anime series, but I was disappointed in this collection for one reason -- none of the extras from the earlier release have been included. This is particularly unfortunate for the Cultural Notes which add a lot to the viewer's understanding of the legend that the series is based on. The collection does include all of the 50 episodes in a box that won't take up much room on your shelf and for a very reasonable price. But I would have been willing to pay a little more and have the extras included also."
3,Bootleg quality,"I love this anime. Been in love with it for YEARS! I purchased this set, but the price should have been a giveaway about the quality.There are NO extras in any way. The menus are crappy and bootleg looking. You can't even select parts from an episode. You get the option to set your language from the 2 choices they give you (Eng. dub, or Jap. w/ Eng. subs) and you get the option to select an episode. That is IT.Luckily the video quality and sound quality are MUCH higher than the bootlegged version I saw in high school. Also, there are mistakes on the episode descriptions on the back of the thin-pack boxes.Just overall a LAZILY put together boxed set. Really disappointing. Good thing it only cost me $45."
5,Not for kids.,"I laughed my ass off. I know it's not a comedy but all the guys try to act supercool, cursing and smoking. Not a kid DVD. I thought it had some homosexual undertones. But I live in America where guys are not supposed to express emotion, so I'm a bit warped.These guys with cool fighting powers band together to face the ultimate evil. Sigh. I also laughed because the boobs on every single girl were drawn the same. Even the little girl.you might like it if your sense of humor is warped like mine. At the end you are ready to say good-bye to them all and never see this video again. Very misogynistic."
1,ROTTEN POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"My experience with this product rivals that of the other reviewers. So I'll not repeat what has already been said. Although I'm good at following directions and seldom have problems with software installation, seldom do I encounter such problems as I have suffered with this product on both an XP and Windows 32 bit systems. My latest adventures with this buggy creation of bad software prompted me to E-Mail an inquiry to their badly-misnamed ""support"" department. Their reply was totally useless. Good Luck?"
2,book is Okay,"The book is okay, but it must be pretty old, since the data in it I have heard for years. I would not have bought it if I had known that."
4,"title is misleading, but advice is great","The title is unwisely chosen, close to a cheap shot, designed to get the attention of people in pain. This is unfair,and diminishes the total effect of the book, which is well researched and documented for a book for a lay audience. It is very helpful to have all the information on glucosamine and condroitin together, with an exact plan. Very useful is the attention paid to the lack of quality control in choosing nutritional supplements. Dr. Theo provides excellent advice on how to choose wisely, and how to avoid poor or deceptive formulations."
4,Double Trouble,"Twins decide to exchange lives for a week that turns into a year because of unforseen life issues. Everyone is decieved. How can that be?? Husbands, lovers ... does no one really pay attention to us?"
5,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!,"I am more into the science fiction and never found the romantic stuff that intresting.....i happened to borrow ""Deceptions"" from my friend just to kill time....now its one of my all time favorites...i bought the book and its sequel too,which is not inleast disappointing(as sequels generally are). ""Deceptions"" is just not a light hearted romantic 'story' its the best in its kind that touches every aspect of our dialy routine in the most amazing way.we come accross a lot of little details we experience in our everyday life and yet fail to recognise and enjoy them.We are taught to make the best of what we have and be grateful for all the good things in our life.It describes the subtle emotions between two indivisuals with an amazing scrutiny.Its a master piece a ""not to be missed"" novel.Highly recommnded."
5,four fun and well-shaped books,"I'm always looking for interesting artwork in children's books for my little boy. This box set is an excellent concept: square- round- triangle- and skinny-shaped books for little kids to gain an understanding of these basic shapes. Radunsky has a delightful touch and subtle humor to his illustrations. (Skinny shows a pencil and a dachsund.) The size of the books is perfect for the 0-3 set, and each book contains about eight picture spreads. The four books also come in a nicely designed (albeit plastic) box, which makes them fun to pull out. Radunsky also has chosen uncommon (at least, I think so) items to show off the shapes: Square shows a cracker; Triangle shows a bird's beak and a street sign. For the price, I think this is a cool present for a two-year-old."
3,ok pan,"This pan was okay, but the ""non-stick"" did not last long. I wanted a small pan to cook an egg in for breakfast, but now the non-stick has chips and dings and I have to add extra butter/spray to make sure my eggs dont stick."
5,Finally!,"I've been a fan of Basement Jaxxx since the first Tomb Raider movie came out. I was thrilled that their single, ""Where's Your Head At?"" was on the soundtrack, at number 9. It is such a good song, and it's so easy to dance to. It's a fun, techno-ish beat that will leave you banging your head and shaking your hips for the 4 minutes and 42 seconds that the song lasts. I was very happy to see their music video for ""Where's Your Head At?"" on AOL. It was quite a humorous treat.So if you like fun, funky beats that you can dance to, then buy the single for ""Where's Your Head At?"" from Basement Jaxxx today!"
5,Jaxx to the max,"When I knew that Where's Your Head At was gonna be a single, I was thrilled, it was the song that got me prancing and dancing to. Energetic, electronic and engaging. That's what I wanna say. Kudos to Astralwerks for releasing a maxi-single in the US! It's cramped with full of good stuff. the remixes to Where's Your Head At are all interpreted differently by each remixer and comes across as a well-coordinated remix project. There are bonuses here too, 2 remixes of the retro-disco Jus 1 Kiss and the acoustic version of the Indian-influenced Romeo. Plus the absolutely wacky video of Head."
2,Undernourished,"Having lived in Frankfurt during the 1980's I learned to appreciate Inbal's achievements as a conductor both live and through broadcasts. His Denon recordings with the Ffm RSO are not only compeling but still sound wonderful.But, what happened here?! There is no way one can approach this symphony blandly. It should be raw and angry, have propulsion and a gamut of emotions. Not here. I could not wait for it to end. Now, that's a sign.Truly dissapointing."
2,"So so book, pictures could be better","My daughter likes it, but the stories are printed with small words making it hard for her to follow along. I would not purchase it again."
1,Considered harmful by veterinarian,"I noticed the jagged edges on this bone after my dog, a chow-huskie mix, had chewed on it for about 1 hour. I brought the bone into my veterinarian, who said, ""I wouldn't feed this to my OWN dogs!""End of story."
5,"Spiritual human potential fullfilled, A facinating account!","This book is one of the most facinating accounts of mans potential for spiritual tranformation. It was written during the actual experience. Most eastern accounts of illumination are written after the fact. This account is different as the author gives you a personal account during and after each deeping state of conciousness. Not only this but from a ""western mind"" viewpoint of the experience. Not vailed in symbolism as most eastern writers. The totality of the experience left him with new insight into the human mystery and a renewed meaning to life. He can be added to the list of Richard Bucks book: ""Cosmic Conciousness"" as one who achieved spontaneous illumination. I recommend Merrell-Wolff's book for anyone seriously on the ""path"" to spiritual enlightenment"
2,Boring and distracting,"Friends, over the years I have read many books purporting to describe the enlightened mind, this book left me wondering ""what is he thinking?"" To spend so much time and effort in this manner makes me wonder what was going on here. This book is boring: no imagination, no heart, no love, no humor, no empathy with his readers, to mention a few. If you were to study with him you would have to sneak out at night and go get a beer before going postal with this guy. Do you think a ""scientific explanation"" for enlightenment will help you? If so you are in for a long and disappointing journey. I will ask this: how many of his students achieved the desired state? Any? No? Don't waste time on this book, use your DISCRIMINATION. If he is an example of the enlightened state who needs it? It will not move you into clarity, it will bog you down in more concepts which lead you in the opposite direction."
1,Excessive Jibber-Jabber with a Catchy Title,"Being a practicing Buddhist for as long as I have, I've come across lots of books on the subject. Speaking only for myself, I found the book excessively wordy and full of so much fluff. The best books about Eastern philosophy are the ones that get to the point without belaboring it or adding unnecessary paragraph upon paragraph which serve only to turn on the snoring machine. In fact, I think the author WAS asleep as his pen hand began rolling across the pages to create this fat opus. For the price, the book is definitely over-hyped. Save your money, go the hot dog stand, instead, and ask for ""one with everything""."
1,Worst teaching toy I have ever bought.,"The sound functions stopped working 5 minutes after using. Even when the sound was working for the first 5 minutes, it wasn't loud enough to draw my kids' attention. My husband and I were Extremely disappointed. It is a piece of junk. I have another sound puzzle from Melissa & Doug. I haven't opened it yet because it is a bit advanced for my kids. I don't expect much on that item either. I'm keeping those just because it is much too a trouble to ship them back."
3,okay,"I wanted to use it as a teaching tool, a little frustrating. Maybe I will put it away for a few months."
2,I like the idea of the product,"When I received this number sound puzzle I put brand new batteries in it and it worked fine the first 2 times we went through the numbers. The third time it didn't work. I pulled the batteries out and put them back in and tried again. It worked. The next time my son tried it, it didn't work. I should not have to take batteries out and screw with it Everytime my child wants to play with it. This was supposed to be brand new yet it is more of an inconvience FAIL!"
3,Phantom,I rated it 3 stars because the magnets are super sensitive and go off on about any number put nearby. Otherwise it was ok.
4,Puzzles for Toddlers,The only reason that I didn't give this five stars is because when my three year old opened it for his birthday it didn't come with batteries. I believe that it should at least come with batteries. Other than that we have purchased MANY Melissa and Doug puzzles and I love them all. They hold up very well and are always bright and colorful!
2,Not great,The idea is great if the thing would work like it's supposed to. All of the numbers do not work on the one we have - fresh out of the box with new batteries too - very disappointed. Melissa and Doug toys are usually so great - not sure what happened with this one.
4,Interactive fun!,"My son and I love to interact with this puzzle. He is 21 months old and really enjoys it. The numbers have pictures underneath them so I can say to him, 'Look for the bunny's' or 'Look for the cars' to help him place the number in the correct slot. While there is some trial and error (as he must turn the numbers around or right side up), the process allows for some good one-on-one time together. I find him playing with it on his own as well if I leave it within arms reach. From time to time the numbers don't say their numeric value and the other night as I walked by the puzzle, the number seven which was empty at the time, said 'Seven Quarters'. That was a little creepy! LOLIt is an enjoyable learning tool and one that is a whole lot of fun!"
1,Disappointing.,"I bought this puzzle and the Alphabet sound puzzle for my nieces for Christmas and was very disappointed. As other reviewers have said, the light sensors are sensitive to the point where just waving your hand over the number without placing a piece causes the puzzle to say the number. Also, when you place the wrong piece in the puzzle, it still says the number. It's going to be difficult for a child to learn anything when no matter what number he places, it is considered correct.Apart from the sound aspect of the puzzle, it is a great, durable puzzle. So, it could be used like a traditional puzzle with the sound off. However, it seems a little expensive for a simple wooden puzzle."
2,Melissa & Doug Numbers Sound Puzzle,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter to help her with number recognition. She enjoys it very much and can play with it daily. I, however, was very disappointed when I put the 2AAA batteries in it and heard the voice for the first time. It is very hard to understand due to the low quality of the voice recording. The sound quality is that of a toy that might have been bought at a dollar store. The puzzle will only work properly in a well lit environment as there are light sensors under each puzzle piece. I didn't know this the first time we played with it and I got upset, thinking that it was damaged as half of the numbers did not read aloud. There is no indication on the packaging that you need good lighting in order for it to work correctly. As a parent I would give this toy one or two stars due to its poor sound quality but my daughter does enjoy it greatly. I do not think its is worth more than the eight dollars I paid for it."
2,Confusing,"I bought both numbers and letters, the idea it is great the problem for me was that when you put for example the number 18 said 19 or if you put the number 8 said 7, I do not want my daughter get confused when she hears one thing for another so I returned them both, need improvement with the sensors."
1,Bad quality,"Device its of very poor quality, the pronunciation is very poor and the sound low quality, when the numbers are place on the space the voice does not always recognized the number, some numbers are not recognized at all, bad choice do not buy!"
1,Sound is confusing,"The sound quality is not very good. And it puts emphasis on the word after the number, such as two FISH, three BIRDS. The only number my son learned from this puzzle is Zero. The rest of the pieces he now associates with fish, birds, etc."
2,Defective sound system,"I bought this toy because of it's educational value for my just turned 3 year old son. I specifically chose this set because the numbers are announced once the correct number puzzle is placed in the correct slot. When we received the toy the first 10 numbers had no sound effects. I did not return the set because of the unnecessary hassle, and so my son did not find it as entertaining and educational as the Alphabet set which we also ordered and arrived in excellent condition."
1,Oh MY GOODNESS,"P need to give up. He just aint bout it no more. tryin to be a role model for his son just messed up his place in tha rap world. He don't rap nomore, he holla, His beats be wack, and what else can i say, he's through."
5,its worth buying,"cd is pretty darn good. Master p postage wasn't very good, but gameface makes up for it. with songs like lose it and get it back, and rock it, and also OOOhhhwee!!! makes this cd great.go ahead add this to your shopping cart, a very good cd! its worth buying."
1,WORST MASTER P CD EVER!,"Gameface is the worst P album i have ever heard! Only track worth playing is 14. Lose it and get it back. This cd doesn't compare to Ghetto D, MP Da Last Don, Ghetto Bill, or Living Legend Certified D-Boy. This is a waste of time to buy and listen to this donkey poo."
3,Not extremely great,"This is a pretty good Master P CD only because it has a few songs on there that are really worth listening to. Many of them aren't some of his best songs. However Ooohhhwee, We Want Dough, and Rock It are really great! I recommend this CD to all Master P fans who don't have this CD. Otherwise I would suggest finding something else because the rest of them aren't up to his standards."
1,not exactly Ghetto D,"Master P was once a street boy fed up with the violence and poverty that had come to plague the sreets of the Calliope. He expressed these emotions on the raw Ghetto D. 5 years later, with an estimated worth of 200 million dollars, the artist formerly known as Master P has become spoiled by the riches and fast cars- and sadly, this is evident in his music.Constant bragging of his wealth will bring the food up in the listener's stomach. What strikes me as curious is that his own brother-C-Murder- never left the street, so his music remained faithful to his violent roots.Master P does not give hip-hop heads a reason for them to continue to purchase his music. The cliches he brings up can easily be found in more creative forms of Cash Money's music, and his montonous ughhh's are no longer in fashion.The time is ripe for P to throw in the towel. He will never make an album like Ghetto D again. He should stick to producing and leace the music to Silkk and the 504 boyz."
5,OOOHHHWEE!,"vedy vedy gooooooooooood, yes, I honor this record, I just wish they made chinese record, that would be the best thing since edible cats!"
2,Very Very Disappointing...,"This CD is so wack. There is only 4 or 5 good songs on here. Master P needs to stop making all of those stupid bounce songs and come with something new. Even Ghetto Postage is better than this. So you can image how bad ""Game Face"" is. Don't waste your money on this.... This has to be the worst Master P CD to date..."
4,MASTER P'S GAMEFACE,"I THINK THIS ALBUM IS REALLY GOOD. MASTER P HAS DID IT AGAIN. MY FAVORITE SONG IS OOOOOHWEEEE. EVERYTIME HE STEP UP TO BAT HE HITS A HOME RUN. GOOD JOB P. ON THIS ALBUM MASTER P IS LETTING YOU KNOW ABOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS OF LIFE, HE'S LETTING YOU KNOW ABOUT THE SAD TIMES WITH THE SONG WHOADIE GONE. THE SONG CALLED WHAT I'M BOUT IS TIGHT TO DEATH BECAUSE ON THIS SONG MASTER P IS LETTING YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT HE IS LIKES TO OWN. HE'S LETTING YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF CARS HE LIKE. HE'S LETTING YOU KNOW HOW MUCH A HOUSE SHOULD COST IF HE BOUGHT IT.(P SAID IF A HOUSE CAUSE LESS THAN A MILLION HE DON'T WANT IT). YOU GO P DO YOUR THANG. MASTER P HAS ONCE AGAIN MADE A VERY GOOD ALBUM. I LIKED ALL THE SONGS ON THIS CD. THIS IS A CD THAT WILL MAKE YOU DANCE TO IT. SO IF YOU OUT THERE AND YOU READ THIS REVIEW AND YOU LIKED WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE ALBUM THEN GO AND BUY IT."
2,P-Miller,Not as good as Ghetto D but a couple of tracks are smashs masterp needs to step his game up if he waants money.big up
1,Master P done went down south....waaaaayy down south,"I don't have that much to say, but I will say that this CD is the wackest piece of junk I have ever listened to from MP. Why isn't he making the hard hitting tracks he used to do back in '96??? The bounce tracks are horrible. He needs to get a new style fast before he gets dissed like Hammer did. Out."
2,two good songs....the rest is trash,"a typical master p album. i bought it for $3 so it was worth it for two songs. ""ghetto ballin"" has a hot old kurtis blow beat, verses are a little better than usual new orleans rapping. really catchy song. the other hot one is the single ""ooooohwee"". this beat is incredibly catchy even though the rapping is bad. as for the rest of the songs they pretty much suck. if master p doesn't have a hot beat in a song, he's hopeless. ""we want dough"" would've passed for a decent beat except the robotic sounding girls in the chorus. it ruins it. aside from that don't spend any more than i did on this album cuz it's 90% filler!"
4,Better than Ghetto Postage,"I dunno P. I expected more from this one, I thought this was the New No Limit. I mean, the album was ok, their were some dope tracks like track 14 is tight as hell, The Block is bangin. But I wish NL was back to the way it used to be musically. I think this is definatly better than Ghetto Postage though. I am a TRU No Limit and Master P fan but I wish he'd either change back to his old style or put some other rappers out in front instead of himself to try and save No Limit. Comon P baby get it together."
5,"Huh, Na Na Na......P is back hard Woodie",Mercy Mr.Percy... No limit fell prey to Cash Money Zillionaires but P's camp recruited some new soliders and they're hot;boy. This is a complete album and the upbeat tempo fits the level P has lefted his army to. Lil Romeo is representing strong for his daddy's latest.
3,New Edition Available,"People are over charging for this. If you're going to spend over retail for this, remember it's a collection of reprints.The New Teen Titans Omnibus Vol. 1 is now available. It has more issues and is cheaper.(My rating is for the edition, not the content)"
5,DC sidekicks come into their own,"I have to admit up front that I'm somewhat biased because this is my favorite comic book series of all time. Naturally I was thrilled to have it collected in hardcover. If you are a fan of the Titans, definately buy it. If you like the dynamics of team books, I would reccomend it as well. Wolfman really does a great job at both characterization and drama. The stories pull you in and really make you care about the characters. Plus Perez's art is just gorgeous."
3,all colors are not 100% cotton,"I ordered several colors of this same item, and found that the gray ones are NOT all cotton, as advertised. Instead, the gray shirts are half cotton / half polyester. Ugh. Very different shirts. The white one and the navy blue one I received were indeed 100% cotton."
4,Tank Tops,Caution: these tank tops run much larger than previous Russell versions. The material is nice and light weight.
1,horrible tank top,"The product description says it somehow wicks moisture with its ""moisture management fabric,"" when it feels just like a regular cotton tank top. Save some money and just buy the Russell ""basic cotton tank,"" which I prefer over this one. Also, the ""full athletic cut"" is very awkward. The chest area is very constricting, while the side (love handles) area is overly roomy. Russell is probably marketing this tank top towards the obese."
5,enjoyed it,"Do you love the classic fairytale Goldilocks and the Three Bears? Thisis a version of that story, illustrated by Paul Galdone's. Thisstory's message is still relevant today, don't go into stranger'shouses! The illustrations are excellent and help tell the storywonderfully."
4,My 2.5 yr-old loves this traditional story.,"I find Paul Galdone's illustrations a bit garish but my son clearly prefers this style over more subtle ones - like Margot Zemach or Jan Brett. I had to really look for a traditional version with the emphasis on the extremes, too hot, too cold, just right - so many modern versions drop this original prose. This had exactly what I was looking for."
3,A bit more than meets the eye,"This book is one of my daughter's favorites. It has lively illustrations, and the language is simple enough for smaller children. We're getting quite a bit of mileage out of it at our home.But I would point out that the author chose not to include the traditional family titles (Papa, Mama and Baby bear). I stronly doubt this was simply an oversight; it seems instead to be based on the author's feminist viewpoints.A big huge deal? Probably not. But important enough so that this ""mama bear"" chose to re-write the story using the traditional idea of a family of bears, rather than some vaugely defined grouping. I would suggest that readers either pick another version or do the same thing."
3,Rewriting Fairy Tales,"I find it amazing that a simple child's tale can be so altered by our PC society. No longer is there a Papa and Mama Bear with their cub Baby Bear. Now its a variation of sizes in the trio of bears, and they're not a family. Family is politically incorrect, don't you see, and we can't teach family to children, nosirree, because we may offend those people living together that are not a traditional family. My advice? Find another Three Bears book, and leave this one to collect the dust it deserves."
3,Giant Not Widescreen,"This review is limted to one comment. Giant is not done in wide screen even though the disk states it is. The format is 4:3 with borders on the sides and top and bottom. Borders on top and bottom to small to ""zoom"" in.""East of Eden"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause"" are both excellent wide screen Cinemascope versions."
4,great acting and great scripts,These three movies go well together. Steinbeck's novel is considered by many to be Steinbeck's best:Giant by Edna Ferber who chronicled the change of the Texas west from a frontier to an oil metropolis.And last but certainly not least the coming of age story of modern teenagerscaught between their parents and society: Rebel Without a Cause.
1,sound sucks,"The sound sucks, I had to turn my tv on very loud to even try and hear it. I will return it if at all possible."
1,GIANT ---(mistake),this is a very dissapointing package becasue you cannot watch giant in its entirtey. The second half is nowhere to be found
4,Classic movies,"I love these movies! Can't beat the classics ! Also a very good value, the quality was good a perfect way to have three James Dean movies! Thank you!"
5,Great Album,"Awesome effort by David Coverdale and Jimmy Page. All the tracks are excellent, no weak songs or throw aways! If you like Whitesnake and/or Led Zeppelin you'll like this album. My only complaint is that there wasn't a part two!"
5,this parental control for mac really works!,haven't had any problems with it. really blocks out content that children should not see! i recomended this product!
4,Strong character-driven mystery,"Beautiful Dani takes her boss's Thunderbird for a joyride on impulse. Before long, a mysterious assailant breaks her hand in a service station bathroom and she begins to encounter people along the road who claim to have met her before. When she discovers a body in the trunk of the car, her descent into nightmare is nearly complete. Dani will question her very sanity and sense of identity before author Sebastien Japrisot unveils the truth to her and us in his clever, surprising finale. Dani is a fully realized character who proves to have inner reserves of strength and wit that are revealed gradually without ever violating character."
2,MEDIOCRE KOREAN ACTION FILM,"A FORMER GOVERNMENT AGENT HOLDS A TRAIN HOSTAGE WITH A BOMB THAT'LL BLOW UP IF THE TRAIN STOPS AND IT'S UP TO A DETECTIVE TO STOP HIM AND FIND A WAY TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE PASSENGERS. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS BASICALLY ANOTHER IMITATION OF ''SPEED''. THE DIALOGUE IS LAUGHABLE AND THE ACTION [WHICH THERE IS PLENTY OF] IS NOT REALLY THAT ENTERTAINING. THE ACTING IS ALSO PRETTY BAD, BUT THE MOVIE TENDS TO SHOW A FEW SIGNS OF LIFE IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES. IF YOU'RE AN ACTION FAN [LIKE ME] AND YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT THIS MOVIE, RENT IT. BUT DON'T BUY IT. ON THIS DVD, YOU HAVE THE CHOICE OF WATCHING THIS MOVIE DUBBED IN EITHER ENGLISH OR FRENCH OR YOU CAN WATCH THIS MOVIE IN ITS ORIGINAL LANGUAGE, WHICH IS KOREAN."
4,Korean action flick makes good entertainment.,"I read so many bad comments that I had to watch this again. I still liked it the second time. Not an A film, just a B action with great suspense elements. This is actually better than Speed in some aspects- mainly less two dimensional with the characters (I mean these are better developed). Speed was a slicker product, and I really liked it too. Tube is Korean with a capital K. Made for Koreans. So of course not all American action film fans will like this much. They just make movies differently than Hollywood. I don't buy this as a pure imitation at all- not even very close. This film maker-director is so good at his craft, even his mediocre film (like maybe this one compared to his previous). is quite good. It did have a few slow, and a few really corny places. So I prefer to give it 3 1/2 stars."
4,Well presented methods,"I like this book, it has a lot of techniques and it interfaces well with the method of meditation on the breath. I would reccomend it for those who want to get all they can out of bringing mindfullness to breathing."
3,lost my attention,"I could just be that lazy ignorant college student, but I feel add if this was written to be a text book (Yawn). I say this because the writings in it are lengthy, and takes a while for points to be made. There are many techniques, but I feel that the way this was written isn't engaging. there's way more "" do this"", than reasoning behind it."
2,stupid book,Ive gotten about half way through this book and really doubt if I can finish it. I learned way more just reading articles off the internet about the CO2 to O2 ratio and the importence of keeping CO2 in your system. To me this is a non-sensical book good for anyone that has no real breathing issues...I strongly recommend finding something else to read.
2,Pretty book,"This book is pretty but I have yet to make anything from it. The recipes are too unusual. There doesn't seem to be anything ""normal"" in the book. I guess I'll have to check again but thus far the book is just a decoration for my bookshelf."
3,High end indulgence,By the time that I bought the ingredients for one of the recipes I had spent more money than if I had gone to her shop and bought the dessert. Beautiful book with enjoyable details from Fran like her inspirations. Makes a lovely coffee table book.
5,Self Healing,I was going to have lung surgery and I needed something to give me positive thinking. This was just perfect for me. I listened to it often before my surgery and after too. I think my speedy recovery was due in part to the positive thoughts I received form this recording. It is very worthwhile.
2,Pretty good...despite software problems,"I""m a regular guy with an average knowledge of computers and computer programs.I can't get any of the software to install for my Magellan. The firmware update simply will not install itself onto the unit. It *could* be my computer, but if I'm having this issue with mine, surely others are as well. Nor can I install the custom POI's program either. It gives me a error code which the online Magellan support does nothing to help for.Despite the software problems, we like it. It gets us where we need to go easily."
3,Nice GPS...but I think I got a lemon.,"Very intuitive GPS system. I really enjoyed it...while I had it. After a week the voice recognition failed and then the GPS started acting goofy. I've since returned this one, but I may give this model a second shake. Another caveat - Magellan customer service never responded to the tech support email I sent them after the VR failed."
3,Review,"I had bought a Mio C310 a year ago and thought of buying a more renowed with text-to-spech unit. So I got the Magellan Maestro 4050. On my first trip with it to Tennessee, it left me going in circles in Johnson City. Good thing I had my old Mio C310 unit in my suitcase for an emergency, which guided me right through. Conclusion, now I have 2 Mio's, the C310 and the newly bought C520 model. Although it costed me much less than the Magellan, so far it's working like I expected it to work. My only proplem with it is that it only has ""Samanthas"" voice in the TTS feature.I'll appreciate if anybody out there would let me know if I can, and how can I change the Samantha's voice."
4,"Great GPS, but..........","The Gps is great, but the voice recognition has a lot to be desired. (car has to be quiet) I have had 2 magellans, and they worked perfectly. This one has all the features, without the crazy price. The bluetooth is great, the POI are right on the money, the voice recognition only does about 10 things. (wish you could enter addresses by voice) The screen size is perfect. 100 times better than Garmin or tom tom. I would buy again........."
2,Many features-but still limited,"My initial impression of this device was quite favorable until it started to freeze up on the road,while ""in the field,"" so to speak. The real straw that broke the camel's back was that the maps contained in the unit were last updated 2006;downloads were available,but the only way to obtain current maps was to buy a DVD from Magellan at a price of $79.99, thus negating the original sale price of the item. This may not seem like a major issue,but the unit would not even recognize the suburb of LaGrange, a major Southwestern suburb just out of Chicago. So ultimately, I returned the unit after a relatively short trial period."
4,What a terrific stress reliever!,"I love my Magellan! This is my first GPS purchase and after researching the different brands/models on Amazon, I am very pleased with my choice. I bought this before a multi-stop trip to the midwest where I did not know the routes to my destinations. So I programmed in the addresses before leaving home and when I got into the rental car, I plugged it in, selected my destination and followed Magellan to the exact locations I wanted to go. Programming it was simple and following its directions was even easier.My only complaint is with the bluetooth hands-free function speaker quality. It does work but the audio quality is mighty poor, both transmitting and receiving. This is no show stopper but it is a little disappointing. Finally, I discovered after my purchase, that a newer model will share my iPhone's contacts list but tis model doesn't have that function. Otherwise, this machine works perfectly for me."
4,Magellan Maestro 4050,"I was excited about the idea of having voice recognition and BlueTooth capability, however some of the claims were not quite as presented. There is no hands free calling, you must dial from a key pad. You cannot make a call directly from the address book, silly. The Voice Recognition is only for a few specific commands.The GPS itself is excellent and Magellan is on their way to hitting a Home Run with this unit, only a few more tweaks needed."
5,Capable,"I have been in search for a navigation system for some time. I tried TomTom, but returned -simpily, maps were too outdated to even be useful. Then ordered Navigon - this product was not ready for the market, too many glitches- then Magellan 4050- this unit gave me the basic information I needed plus several nice extras, but most of all, quick satelite connect, updated maps, easy bluetooth connect and easy use of AAA services through this units bluetooth. I have had some trouble with the subscription to to radio traffic kit and will contact Magellan, but otherwise a unit I can use."
2,This unit stinks!,"Especially after the 4050 Software Update 2.62/3.61if you already own this unit, don't upgrade the firmware to this version!!!"
4,We love Maggie,"Love the shape, slim, big touch screen, better on/off button than the roadmate, turn-by-turn street name. Would be greater if it acquires satelite signals faster."
3,very good,"we went to spring break vacation to Orlando florida with Magellan 4050 Gps,It was perfectly worked to my trip. Unfortunately it didn't work on my return trip. The gps was frozen.ThanksMathew"
3,Doesn't compare to a Garmin....,"I bought this item hoping to save a few bucks cause it is less expensive than the Garmin nuvi660 I wanted.....big mistake. Didn't even compare....the clarity, the maps, the voice....everything in the Garmin is better IMO."
4,Review of Magellen Maestro 4450 GPS Navigator,"I received the device in a timely fashion, soon after I ordered it. The box contained the proper items. I immediately began using it on several trips, not really understanding how it was to be used. To my delight, I found that with my minimal understanding of how it was supposed to work, it did perform the tasks I expected. The voice feed back was very definite and clear, and it gave very good directions on how to arrive at my intended destination. I called for assistance on one occasion and the help I received was very timely. I consider its biggest weakness is that it lacks a complete list of streets I wish to access. This is because the map it is using is not an up-to-day map and newer streets or sub-divisions are not included in the map. Otherwise, it is of great assistance in driving into unknown territory. Sincerely, Dallas E. Murdoch"
2,Shipped wrong item,"I ordered and paid for a 4050 and when i tried to update the firmware, discovered I was actually sent a 4040. Shame on Amazon."
1,DO NOY BUY MAGELLAN PRODUCTS,"Before you make your purchase, pick up the phone and call customer support. You will find it is in India and it is worthless. They will lie to you about shipments you have been promised, know nothing of the products and are completely useless. To test this report, I challenge you to try to find anyone in the USA to speak to. Every phone number is routed to India as if there is no US presence at all. DO NOT waste your money. Buy anything but a Magellan. Call (909)394-500 to verify that what I am telling you is true."
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE,"THIS IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE. FIST TIME OUT IT TURNS OFF AND WILL NOT RESTART, HAD TO CALL TECH SUPPORT AND TALKED TO HODJI IN INDIA TO FIND OUT IT IS A ALL TOO COMMON PROBLEM WITH THEIR GARBAGE UNIT. OH VERRY GOOD ..IF IT HAPPENDS AGAIN JUST PUSH THE RESET BUTTON. IT HAAPPENS ALL THE TIME WITH OUR UNITS.. GO BUY A GARMIN!!"
2,Dissappointed.,"It's so big and the base is so tall that it blocks vision, the display is hard to read in daylight, it tells me to go the wrong way at times, the street the names appear with dots rather on the streets themselves, and it shows me driving through fields rather than on roads at times. It does pick up satellites quickly, but the interface is cumbersome and requires taking one's eyes off the road too much. I haven't been able to connect to it with Bluetooth at all. Save your money for another model. I haven't tried the traffic because I'm either returning it or selling it."
4,my magelon gps,"I am very pleased with my new Mageleon gps unit...I took a trip recently and it got me right to where I wanted to go...have had no problems so far, except when she doent want to talk to me somtimes and that frustrates me."
1,Naughty Book,"This book was used for a two-course introductory math series at Stanford in 1996-7 and 1997-8. The book drew so many complaints that it was abandoned after two years. Personally, I found it difficult to understand many of the formal proofs and explanations provided. Many shortcuts were taken in solving the example problems which made them difficult to follow. The answers to problems in the back of the book were frequently incorrect. This is a poorly written book for all students except those extremely insightful in mathematics."
3,"Sometimes it takes a second read, or third, or fourth....","I liked this book because it is written at a slightly more sophisticated level than most lower division math books. Admittedly, it is difficult to understand some of the proofs and examples on the first read. It just takes some time, after a second or third read, before the text begins to make sense. Then you'll realize the examples are presented quite well and you have everything you need to solve the problem sets. And you know you've learned the material well if you understand the text and you can do the problems, which are oriented more to make you think than compute."
1,Limited,book is very very limited in its diagnosis and what it does have is incomplete and not very helpful. Would not recommend at all.
1,"Not a learning tool, forget it.",Not worth spending your money on. I felt as though the book left out the rational for selecting the assessment or plan.
1,Don't bother reading it,I took the advice of the reviewer below and read Mr Bracey's last chapter. It is pathetic. The first reviewer is right on base.
2,Matches the bra but...,"...I'm no skinny minnie. It looks to be enough material to cover my little pooch at the bottom of my tummy. And when I got it, it seemed like it was the right size to do the job--other thongs/undies with less material have done so. But for some reason this just seemed to bag around it and emphasize it. Not enough give/elastic in the material or something. I'm not sure. But it's not flattering in pale colors"
2,Simplistic,"Just as I wanted more from the movie, compared to the book, I wanted more from this game. Too simple, without the complexity of either the book or good military software. Given a choice, I would give this one a pass."
3,Typical Romance Novel,"I love Anita Stansfield and have been an avid fan for years. I have loved ALL of her novels. But ""Towers of Brierley"" was not up to par. I liked it, but it lacked the details and backbone that most of her novels possess. It was predictible and and too short. Everything happened too fast making it unbelievable! Adding more meat to the story would have made it more enjoyable. Bottom line: not her best, but good if you want to sit down and read a typical romance novel."
4,"really good, but not the best","i enjoyed this book, but it could have really been better. It wasn't up to the regular anita stansfield story. It was still quite good though! I really enjoy reading anything by this author!"
3,Not all that.,"I drive an '05 Subaru Legacy 2.5GT.For something so expensive, I would have thought there would have been less assembly on my part. I pre-assembled the unit to look like the picture night before install.The long shield trim was the only thing that was difficult. Not sure why the bolts didn't seat all the way on one part.Installation was pretty easy into the car. Not everything had the best of clearance. A heated hose makes contact with the sharp edge of the heat shield, could cause a problem. I used the trimmed shield trim piece to fit on the heat shield to protect the hose. One bolt hole for the air sensor didn't line up correctly.Idle is fine, but accelerating produces a sound like when you smile big and draw air through your clenched teeth.Didn't notice increase in HP.Overall, we shall see. I will update if anything changes or if something happens to my gas mileage.I think I should have just bought the filter for the stock set-up."
3,Number 1,I would have to say this album is hard to grasp if your not a huge Scott fan. This is more of a younger side. Now his new album is better!
4,Great,"For years Robotech has satisfied me with those great detailed plotline and great ideas. Thanks to this book, you can have an awsome RPG and u can find out lots of information on Robotech in general.While maybe not the greatest of the Robotech sourcebooks it is up to previous books' standards. Too bad most of these books are out of print. :-("
2,I'm Trying to be Fair... Really,"Good photography, they visit interesting looking places... but the whole thing is a self-directed tribute to Plunky and the Skipper and what wonderful people they are. The Cubans and their music are merely co-stars. Occasionally, you're allowed to hear some extremely talented musicians play a bit. If you know the slightest bit about Cuban music, you'll learn nothing. I was very disappointed.The DVD ""La Tropical"" is a far, far better documentary and, without intending to, presents Cuban music much better."
2,beware of size,"the shoes are as cute as the picture and my daughter loved them but the size was way off. she wears a size 3 in shoes, so that is what i ordered, but when they came in they were a couple sizes too small. she really needed about a 5 in womens."
2,WAY too narrow for a toddler,"These mocs are cute, but the toddler size (8) I ordered was just way too narrow for my daughter's feet. It's as if the foot last used was just a smaller version of an adult's foot -- but grownups have much narrower feet, proportionally, than little duck-footed toddlers. Had to send them back. Too bad."
4,Good collection of creepy stories,"This is a good collection of creepy stories. As usual, Clive Barker delivers wild images, exciting plots and impactful language. The story about the hands is particularly creepy and memorable. If you're new to Clive Barker, start with one of his full-length books and try the short stories later. Full-length character development is where he really shines. If you already love his writing, you'll enjoy these dark tales.AUDIO VERSION - I'm sorry for Clive Barker that this audio book was performed and directed so poorly. Dillinger Steele mispronounces 50 or so words narrating this short collection. If you love the English language and Barker's beautiful prose, you'll cringe listening to Dillinger Steele mangle it."
3,Interesting short stories,"These are short stories by Clive Barker. I especially liked Age of Desire, the story of a man who, while being experimented on - is given an injection of a very potent aphrodisiac. Chaos ensues when it is uncontrollable. I like the get-to-the-point style of writing. And I like the length of the stories, as well."
2,I'm starting to believe Barker is not for me,"Aside from the Body Politic, the short stories in this book are not memorable. As a matter of fact I have a hard time recalling them to memory ,even though I finished the books only 7 months ago. At his best Clive Barker can scare the hell out of me, but it doesn't seem that he writes at his best 70% of the time during a book."
1,Did a 10th grader write this?,"This is a horribly written piece of garbage. Why it was published is a mystery to me. It needs to be proofread, spellchecked and re written. Th stories are nonsensical gross-outs that go nowhere and leave the reader feeling unsatisfied. This is pure bush league. What an embarrassment to literature. Try Stephen King for sophisticated, interesting horror."
3,Grace Abounding: an Academic Resourse,"""Grace Abounding"" is a critical commentary on the book of Hosea in the Old Testament. It analyzes important themes in each chapter of Hosea, breaking the chapters down into verses with a single theme. It is useful in presenting an overall picture of Hosea. It presents different interpretations of some phrases which is useful in getting a different angle on the original meaning of the author. However, for someone who is taking an advanced theology class, this book is not technical enough to be a really good resourse for writing an exegesis paper. It seldom presents the actual Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic words which are controversial in their interpretation."
5,Must Have it,"It's a good thing for a Simpson adicted, but if you aren't, buy it anyway, there are several great episodes that oyu and your family can watch it on the spare time. It brings to you episodes like ""Sideshow Bob Roberts"", ""I love Lisa"", ""The Trouble with Trillions"", ""Trash of the Titans"", ""Two Bad Neighbors"" and ""Duffless"", where Homer promisses Marge that he will stop drinking bear during a month. It's a great Boxed set, you must have it."
4,Time to vote!,"Cast your vote for laughs, man! The Simpsons Political Party is a great source for laughs and fun. It is not that good souce on history; ect...It's best to get the bad news out frist. The Simpsons Political Party has very litte about the government; in fact it has nothing to do about the government. But the fact that they have to reach out to government makes your laughs limited.Now the good news. For quick laughs you'll want to buy this. The funniest shows are with Hommer. From being sanitation commissioner, to working for the FBI. It's very funny-) Bart and Lisa are on a roll to. They get to put Sideshow Bob in the slammer and have a contest in science fair. Marge....... she has the house looking nice.This only half of it and recommed you buy. Just think of the words""It's ok'ly dok'ly"""
3,"Politics, Schmolotics","I pretty much mirror the opinions on this boxed set as the other reviewers: there's some decent material, but it's not exactly very ""political."" Which is really a shame, because 'The Simpsons' have offered some of the best political satire on TV -- Namely, 'Mr. Lisa Goes To Washington' [Season Three], '2 Cars in Every Garage, 3 Eyes on Every Fish' [Season Two], 'Last Exit To Springfield' [Season Four], 'Sideshow Bob Roberts' [Season Six], and my three side-splitting favorites, 'Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington' [Season Fourteen], 'Homer Bad Man' [Season Six], and 'Citizen Kang' from 'Treehouse of Horror VII' [Season Eight]. If you'd really like a more accurate taste of political comedy that the Simpsons offer, I'd recommend looking up these episodes on your local TV Guide and TiVo'ing them.However, for a mixed-bag collection, this box set is admittedly a good buy."
5,Excellent shoes,"I love them! I wear them almost everyday, with jeans, athletic wear, or a casual skirt. As a stay at home mom, I look for items that are stylish and functional. Love it!"
5,my son's favorite toy,Our 12 months old loves this toy. Walks around outside and inside. Also great at learning how to share as kids can also use the seat and walk each other around.
1,Dangerous Toy,"I have twins and they received these walkers for their first Christmas. We were very excited about these walkers and like the idea they could use them together. We soon discovered these toys have a bad design and are potentially extremely dangerous. Both of my girls had the same thing happen, they would be trying to walk behind the toy pushing the handle and their pants would get caught under a wheel. This causes them to trip and their necks would get stuck on the handle bar. Since their feet were stuck, they wouldn't move their head started to choke. These are a neat idea, but major design error."
5,Everything we hoped for!,"This walker wagon has not disappointed in the least! My 1yr old loves it and is completely stable behind it. The wagon is so sturdy there are no concerns about it tipping while he pulls up on it. He loves giving his toys a ride. Overall, we are completely satisfied and feel we made the best selection for him."
3,"Wrong parts included, as other reviewers noted!","Neat toy and all, but they included the wrong parts as another reviewer noted. In summary, this is way over priced for what you get and they can't even include the correct bolts to install the handle!"
3,"Quality Item, but it is heavy and leaves blue marks on the wall","Problems with this wagon:1) It is too heavy for 9 month olds to push especially on carpet2) If it gets banged into the wall, it will leave a blue line on your wall.Good things about this wagon:1) It looks really nice and is a high quality product2) Is fun to play with for kidsBecause of the reasons above, we had to make this an outside toy because we didn't want blue lines all around our house and was easier to push on cement."
1,One star for most original crap,"I can NOT believe someone actually put this together and believed they would make money. It sounds like that young asian from American Idol that sang ""she bang, she bang!"". Very sad."
4,"I believe ""whimsical"" is a good description...","A charming plot, great cast, and refreshingly ""odd""... purchased this DVD when it came out and it has never been in jeopardy of being traded in."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't waste your money. Liu is completely miscast and ridiculously dressed. Femme fatale she is not. Murphy apparently was put into this film as a tester for his comedic ability/kooky romantic leading man ability. Both are sadly tested in a strange script/plot which could've been quite interesting. It took me three tries (and I am an avid Murphy fan) to watch the whole film. Much of the dialogue is awkward and the situations more bizarre than ""zany"", although the supporting cast seemed comfortable and more realistic. One scene in particular made me chuckle involving the film ""geeks"" knowing just when a movie is returned by how much tape has been wound and not rewound. I felt the same way."
4,Works with my Mac network - a little finickey,This server was a little tough to setup. I originally had a 3 PC network when I set it up. Over time I've switched over to 3 Macs. It is much easier to manage on the Mac network. Good product that does what it says.
4,Working great on Windows and OS X!,"I'm writing this mostly to thank John S. Lyon Smith, whose review should be called ""Buffalo Print Server: the Missing Manual."" Following his instructions, the print server installed with no problems. The provided setup CD couldn't even find the device and was useless."
1,Not for lack of trying,"Based on stellar reviews, I got mine and hooked it up yesterday. Everything seemed to go smoothly until I tried to print. I was told that my HP Officejet 4315v All in One was compatable with my router and my Vista program. After more than an hour talking to tech support with Buffalo, it didn't print. It recognized my printer and supported it but no dice. They said it may be faulty and to send it back. Amazon was flawless in the transaction. One issue was that during the setup, it erased my HP driver and I had to reinstall through the website. Too bad it was a flop."
2,"Bad documentation, ok product.","Let me first point out that [...], whom I bought this from, is a great company. I bought this product, it shipped very quickly, and when I couldn't get it to work (see below), they were very quick and courteous to issue a fully pre-paid RMA shipping label. I highly recommend[...]; excellent support, very quick turnaround.Now the print server itself appeared to be ready to work out of the box. However, it just failed to recognize my HP LaserJet 1020. Also, the software packaged with the device was flat out broken. It was impossible to assign a static IP to the device, and I had to search Buffalo's website to find a ""new"" package. The package finally allowed me to assign a static IP. However, the printer was still offline. The Buffalo tech support was fairly quick to respond to my issue (within 24 hours), but they weren't terribly helpful. I ended up having to return the product."
1,Unable to Configure and Use,"Based on reviews, this unit was supposed to be compatible with Mac printing.Sadly, I could not get it to work on Mac network with a Canon Laser Printer."
2,Works but not with a Mac/Canon i9100,"Been looking for a way to share my i9100 with Mac and PCs on my network. The Buffalo gadgets works as advertised as long as you don't have brain-dead drivers from Canon that prevent you from networking! Apparently if you use it on a PC only network, Canon allowes you to share, but not with a Mac!So, as long as you don't have a config like mine, I'd recommend it. Setup was pretty easy; seen better and worse but the server seems to work as advertised, just not for me."
3,Couldn't get it work.,Well I done some checking before I bought the product and was excited to get it. But I couldn't ever get it to work. The good thing is that I had no problem returning it.
1,won't work with multifunction printers,"It does not indicate anywhere that this print server can not work with a multifunction printer. In fact, even the manufacturer's own tech support didn't know. I spent over 20 hours trying to get this thing working until finally the tech support figured out the problem. It may be an excellent print server for regular printers, but buyer beware: if you have a multifunction printer - this will not work!"
1,Limited compatability,"I bought this for my Lexmark inkjet printer. Even though Lexmark is possibly the most common printer around, the Buffalo server wouldn't work with it. That's life. However, the real problem is that I called their tech support. Listed as being open 24/7. After holding for an HOUR, the phone was picked up, I heard someone talking to someone about the YANKEES, and then they hung up. I was steamed. I called back, and hung for another 20 minutes. I then processed my Amazon return while on hold with them. Bottom line, as you can see from other reviewers, this unit has limited compatability, and no tech support. If your time is valuable, skip over this and find something that is known to work."
5,GREAT PRINT SERVER,"I read many review about print servers and how they didn't work well, were difficult, many negative comments. So I just dove in and purchased the Buffalo LPV3-U2 print server.What a joy. I set up a network printer in minutes! This is how technology is supposed to work. Smooth, uncomplicated installation. I highly recommend this product."
4,Works well enough. Documenation is acceptable but minimal.,"A few quick notes:- Setup via web interface on a Mac (instead of installed Windows software) worked fine, although there is an admin password that is not in the documentaion. (A troll through various online forums turned this up, althought the manual hints at it.)- It works find from XP, Vista, and Mac OS X- The big problem for me was the printer: not all USB printers are designed to work this way. Check your manufacuturer before investing! My HP PSC 1610 required third-party open-source drivers installed on the Mac, and making it work on XP required tricking it, by installing the printer as a USB printer and then changing the IO port afterwards.- The small size is nice, but this is mitigated somewhat by a power brick somewhat larger than the unit itself."
5,Excellent introduction to the Roman Catholic Church,"When I was looking at Catholicism in the early 1990s, this was the only book available to me on Catholic doctrine in my public library. I lived in a very small, mostly Mormon town.This book was a huge influence on my life. I ended up becoming Catholic after my move to Salt Lake City. I have often referred back to this book. It is very clealy written and quite useful to the ordinary Catholic.You won't find anything in here that is contrary to Catholic teaching. It is a faithful and sure exposition of the Catholic faith."
2,"Poorly written, not interesting","I bought this book based on the excellent recommendations it had but I was disappointed. The writing style is unique (very casual, lots of things in list format), but I don't think it is well written. Many cliches and ""cute"" ideas of what heaven is like.The plot goes back and forth between the narrator in heaven talking with famous dead writers and the author's last few days on earth when he fell in love in Rome. For one long chapter he spends a lot of time talking about a foozball tournament, and the strategies and discussions that go along with it, which is not very interesting.The characters seem shallow and the dialogue is mechanical..."
3,enjoyed the book,"I enjoyed this book. It took me a while to get into it, but once I did, I enjoyed it."
4,Too Fast!,"I'm only commenting on Track #7, 'Fingerbreaker,' since it's the only one I've heard, so I gave the rest of the record the benefit of the doubt with 4 out of 5 stars. Anyway, 'Fingerbreaker' is supposed to be one of those ragtime tunes that's played up tempo as the fingering is complex, thus the title 'Fingerbreaker.' I don't know who plays the piano on this, but it's horrible! Whomever's playing it is just attempting bravado by playing it as fast as possible. It doesn't matter that he hits the right notes most of the time, because he's not hitting them correctly, and it has no soul. I'm surprised that a supposedly experienced pianist would be this amateurish in his playing. Speed is nothing without feeling, and there's no feeling whatsoever in this performance which totally fails. Obviously, the audience are also a bunch of amateur listeners and probably inebriated to boot. This is not worthy of having been recorded and the pianist should be ashamed."
2,almost did not work,"The new toner cartridge came without a critical retaining pin attached. I had to take apart my old toner cartridge to dig out my old retaining pin. When installed the printer still shows ""Out of Toner"" warning light. This product does not appear to be the same quality as the original toner cartridge."
4,Ink toner,"The toner seams to be doing a good job but it does make a odd sound as it is printing. The guilty is good and the price was even better. I would buy from this company again, and have."
5,it works,"We got this at our apo address quickly, which was awesome. We opened it up, put it in and our printer went right back to work. What more could we ask for?"
5,Least expensive and performs better than previous after market cartridges I've bought,"I've used this cartridge for several months. It has performed better than previous after market cartridges that I've bought that cost twice as much. My Canon laser printer overheats the paper after around 30 or 40 copies and with previous cartridges I've experienced a deterioration where the toner of other cartridges won't stick fully to the paper. I have not experienced that with this toner when my printer overheats, thought I still wait until my printer cools down before printing more pages."
1,It does not work at all!,"After reading the reviews, we decided to purchase this one. The delivery is fast and the package looks nice. But the product does NOT work at all. We did follow the installation instruction step by step. Put it in without any problem. However, no any ink.white paper out.Manufacturer/seller, how can I contact you to resolve this issue?"
5,Save money on OEM,"I was doubtful at first, but so far after 300 prints, it is still going strong. No smudges, no lines, no gaps. It works just like the OEM for a fraction of the price.I will most definitely be ordering this again! This was for a Canon ImageCLASS MF3240"
5,Too Good But True!,"This one is just an excellent compatible toner cartridge. I had purchased other compatible cartridges before but they gave printer installation errors and dirty printed sheets. This one, on the other hand, gave no printer error messages and prints very cleanly. What a bargain!"
2,Toner Performance,"I ordered 4 toners. The very first one I used seemed to have a defective roller, such that the print goes from a very light unreadable to dark readable. When I pulled out the cartridge, the roller pinion came off. What attracted me to order this is the price, How good or bad the other three are --- remains to be seen."
1,Shot drum,"The cartridge I received had either a defective drum or a worn-out drum (I suspect the latter). The quality was incredibly uneven, and copied lightly even on the darkest exposure setting. I won't be buying from this source again."
3,I love Shakira but not this DVD,If you speak spanish ignore this review--I don't. Shakira has some very hot music videos out there but this is not very sensual like some of her other ones
1,MUSIC CALMS THE SAVAGE BEAST...,"THIS REVIEW IS FROM AN EVERYDAY GUY, IF YOU FOLKS OUT THERE EVER SAW ME YOU'D NEVER PEG ME AS A SHAKIRA FAN TYPE..With that said-Such is the power of ShakiraYears from now, Shakira's music and legacy will live on...This DVD is the best introduction into the world of Shakira you'll find. I liked Laundry Service and Even the English and Portuguese remix audio cd'.s But this my friends is HER at her best. The range of musical, emotional and lyrical subtleties of this artist will satiate your appetite just enough and still keep you coming back for more. This DVD features well thought arrangements perfectly executed for the UNPLUGGED acoustic setting. From one song to the next you'll find yourself immersed.Very high replay value, pop into the DVD player after one of those days and soon you'll have a big grin on your face and forget your troubles.Works for me!"
3,No Spanish subtitles,I would like the option to read in Spanish too. Maybe it is too much to ask but they could add video clips not just the concert
3,Pastuerized,"To tamed down for the American Audience. She keeps it low key so as not to offend, I should have bought her Paris Performance."
1,horrible,please ...please before you start your laying out....im sure it won't take long to figure out the dimensions on the plans...on your own none of the dimensions add up...take the lighthouse for example..pg 106-109 the octogons are all messed uppg. 108 add up the bottom octogondimensions . 1 3/4..+ 1 3/4..+ 2 1/2..does NOT add up to 6 1/16 ..did this book HAVE an editor?a comment from anyone who feels this way would be welcome
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Do Not Buy This Book. The plans are full of errors. I went to make the gazebo bird feeder. The directions say to cut three hexagons, and refer you to the diagram on the following page. The diagram on the next page is an octagon. And the measurements are off."
3,A rehash of the old flash toons.,"I wouldn't say this was an uninspired rip-off of the old Flash cartoons.. not because it has complete segments directly copied without even changes in script (""I feel like a young boy..""), or because there are many bits which are the same animation with slightly different dialog.. but because it's basically a congealed scab of what was edgy and funny in 2000 - reheated and extended far longer than it deserved to be, in 2006. This movie wouldn't be worth the price of admission, even if it was free.That said, I'm still happy to have it in my collection. I'll stick to the shorts, though."
3,A musical?,"I thought that with the description that this would be a fun animated musical relating to gay people. But some of the songs were lousy solo numbers that were almost unbearable and inaudible. It's a cute movie, but not as good as the back cover raves about. Some of the celebrity voices are only in it for a few seconds."
2,Waste of $$,I wasted my money with this buy. It was my fault I had never seen the show. It is badly made and a horrible movie with a bad story. The only people that should buy this are those whove seen the show and liked it.
2,Not the same as the internet,"I found this movie long and drawn out. Borrow it from a friend, don't spend the $ on owning a copy."
5,Fun (and Funny) Spoof of Everything Gay,"Created by one of the driving forces behind ""The Simpsons,"" this adult cartoon about the quirks of gay life is an absolute blast from beginning to end. ""Queer Duck"" spoofs everything from drama queens, divas, gay conversion therapy, dance numbers, family gatherings, and a variety of other knowing gay characteristics. Worthy of repeated viewings for the rapid fire jokes, and basically a very fun way to spend 75 minutes (if only it were longer!). Included are 5 original shorts that were first seen on Showtime prior to premiere episodes of ""Queer as Folk""."
3,SO so,"I was sort of disapointed in the movie. Compared to the cartoons, the movie just wasn't as funny which was surprising."
4,Jupiter Affect finally delivers,"I've listened to the Jupiter Affect since their PGL days. Their ""Instructions..."" CD is their best work to date. Their irreverence and non-conventional styles really come together in this CD. I mostly like the juxtaposition of alchemy with a pop beat. Listening to this CD has made up for the wasted time spent listening to their previous works.I recommend it highly."
1,Socialism thorugh and through,"If you think personal responsibility and limited government is a good thing then this book will only upset you. I watch him on Kudlow and company debate Steve Moore and lose time and time again, but he seemed like a smart guy. In order to make an argument you must know the other side. I was very upset because although i disagree with everything in this book, there were no statistics to back up any of his points. Very few charts; very few analytical arguments; just a bunch of pandering to the liberal left that wants everything given to them. According to bernstein the government should play an integral part in your life. Privitized social security --- no way --- the gov't can get you a better return --- Universal health care is a must in his eyes---- i was shocked time and time again as i read this ---- I would not buy this if you actually think the money you earn would be better in your pocket instead being blown by our government on useless entitlement programs."
5,Rubber Replacement Pads By Attwood,"Boaters finally can replace the pads on their motor toter-motor saver, with out purchasing the whole motor toter. A substantial cost savings. Very easy to install with nut and bolts. Install time is 15 minuets start to finish."
2,Too Sweet and Sticky,"I love quinoa and sesame, but these bars are too sweet and stick to my teeth. Disappointing."
3,A Wedge of Solid Syrup,"It was too sweet for me and the texture was uncomfortable to chew. It is a rock hard, thin rectangle of sesame seeds and dried sweetener. When I tried to chew it - little shards of very sharp sugary bits sort of scratched my tounge and inside of my cheeks. I'd rather just snack on an apple with some peanut butter on it - fresher, cheaper and healthier. But this is still much better than eating junky candy bars."
2,NOT FRESH,"I've had a subscription of this product for about a year. The bar is delicious and nutritious, making a perfect snack. They're not easy to find in the market, so I've been ordering from Amazon. The problem is on the last 2 deliveries they were stale. One time only would be lack of luck, but 2 in a row... I cancelled my subscription. For the bar itself I would give 5 stars (when it's fresh) but unfortunately it's not working with Amazon, they are sending old bars."
3,Arrived in broken pieces,Entire box of Quinoa bars were all broken (18packs). Second box had 5 bars that were allbroken. Packing material was in the box toprotect the individual boxes but either did not work or they were shipped already broken.Product very brittle and dry.
1,HUGE difference in fat content on package vs. box!!,"I ordered these thinking that they would be a low fat treat as I am trying to diet. Yeah, I know they are good fats, but I reserved my good fats for coconut oil. The nutritional information on Amazon states that they have 2.7 grams of fat per bar and the packaging says that they have 12 grams of fat per bar!!! HUGE difference in my opinion. If you are looking for a healthy low fat treat for when you just HAVE to have something sweet, this isn't it. These will last me for years now since I don't feel that I can eat one without the guilt!"
3,they are okay,okay for no being able to eat alot/wish they had something else to add a little more flavor/but will still order more of them just the way they are
3,Bill,A disappointment. I wanted a nutritious bar to eat as a part of a meal when hiking or working on a field project. The primary ingredient is rice syrup; quinoa makes up only 10%. It has 14 grams of sugar (quinoa contains no sugar). It is more of candy than a healthful snack.
2,Sugar by any other name...,"I was disappointed when my order arrived and I realized the first ingredient in these organic protein bars is syrup. Date and/or Rice Syrup = sugar in my book. In my opinion, this is a candy bar disguised as a protein bar. One pro - it is delicious, but read the labeling before you by it, especially if sugars are something you are trying to avoid."
2,Make an appointment with the dentist,Too hard. Gets stuck in your teeth. Doesn't taste that good. Our family of three each had one. We donated the rest to the church.
1,Too hard and brittle,"These bars are nowhere near as good as Oskri's other products. I ate only a small portion of one bar and found it to be a sticky, brittle mess. I will probably ground up the other bars and use them as crunchy pieces on top of yogurt. I do not recommend this product. The Oskri Granola Bars are so much better. I buy them on Subscribe and save!"
3,"I've learn to Drink Tea or something hot, they are Sticky","Edit: NEED to see my Dentist :} Ate too Fast didn't have hot tea or other food like I said before even though I use these A LOTDenTek Easy Brush Cleaners (8 ct.)orButler Go-Betweens Cleaners 8 eaI bought them Yesterday!!!

4,Good afternoon snack!,"I have purchased these bars several times, and I find them to be a really good afternoon snack. They are sweet with honey and crunchy. My friends at work enjoy them, too."
4,Music of Hikari Oe,"Listend, loved. I don't listen to classical music often, but I listen to this one almost every day."
3,Matusow: what was he thinking?,"The ""unraveling of america"" was by far the most illrepresented mind jarble i have ever read. The authors uncanny ability to misconstrue the facts dealing with the Great Society was so incrediable it actually made me laugh out loud in mid sentence. For all of you considering to by this book my best advise would be to instead purchase a copy of charles murray's book ""losing ground""."
4,Great Read,I liked the characters depicted in this book. A really interesting storyline presents itself in this book. Worth the read for sure. Interestingly enough the author was to write a couple more books but I cannot find any mention of further works anywhere. If someone out there knows of further works by this author please email me and let me know of it. johndorsey@charter.net
2,"Hmmmm....if LTJ is on it, I'm sure it's decent.","Well, that's perfect! None of your featured songs are even Less Than Jake songs! So why is it in the LTJ section?"
1,so disappointing,"Jo Koy: Don't Make Him AngryWe have seen Jo Koy on Chelsea Lately many times and have always laughed. But 10 minutes into this DVD, we shut it off. Boring, not clever, and definitely not funny."
2,hmmm,Nothing I expected. I have seen him before and this was not his best work...also a little short. I prefer Dane Cook.
1,ZERO STARS!,"Amazingly disappointing. He's so funny on Chelsea Lately so what gives?Started off very unfunny and then began ranting about the French. The Bush/Chaney people must have been thrilled. If he's trying to impress that Hasselback lady on The View, he'll need to clean up his language first.43 minutes was way too long for this piece of trash (we barely made 10). We usually give away dvd's cd's and things we don't want to Goodwill and other charities, but to save others the anguish, this one gets destroyed (in the greenest manner possible.) Thanks for nothing!"
4,Enjoyable,This is enjoyable to watch on a slow day. A day where you don't do anything. Kind of lost a little steam during the second half though. And it seemed like he was struggling. But over all pretty funny if you just stick through it.
5,Let's laugh,"The first time I saw Jo Koy on comedy central , I went to Amazon to look for his videos. If you like comedy Jo Koy will have you laughing with tears . Awesome !!!"
5,I love this CD!,I never tire of listening to this CD. Walt Wilkins is a treasure with his soulful voice and songwriting.
2,"""Deep Thoughts"" from Dobyns","If you are a fan of the Dobyns we all know and love in collections like ""Velocities,"" this book will be a terrible disappointment. What was Dobyns thinking?A collection of goofy aphorisms with even goofier ""illustrations."" How the mighty have fallen. . . .Hope he gets back into his old groove soon."
5,Benediction,I play these sonatas everyday while eating breakfast and getting ready for what the day will bring. I consider this music to be a benediction upon my day.
2,Disappointing,"I have been a Pat Travers fan since 1980 and always looked forward to his new releases. Gotta tell you, this one really let me down. I like his ability to cover other's work (Whipping Post, Crosstown Traffic, I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide to name a few) are excellent versions. COuldn't wait to hear his take on ""White Room"", ""Day of The Eagle"" and ""Inside Looking Out"" but they are substandard for his abilities. Maybe it's the trio format, not sure but I wouldn't recommend this one. Sorry Pat, no offense but this one is a stinker."
5,Fasten your seat belts !!!,No more words need to be said other than the four above! Buy this cd and you'll see what I mean .
1,BEWARE! No support for NTFS drives!,"I bought this device specifically to allow me to use two external hard drives to give me instant NAS--and according to the product information available, this looked like just what I needed. (I looked at the Linksys NSLU2 also, but the ext3 reformatting of any attached drive--and associated destruction of all existing data--ruled it out quickly).As others have noted, the DNS-120 allows you *read* access to NTFS drives--but you can't write to them, making them fairly useless from a practical standpoint. They just posted this fundamental limitation on their product support page today or yesterday. If one is inclined to believe their support people, lack of NTFS support was a surprising corner case to them. Personally, I find that hard to believe given the prevalence of NTFS drives in the field.The statement on the tech support page for the DNS-120 reads:"
2,No NTFS - at all.,"The D-Link website just posted an updated FAQ. This device will not work with NTFS drives at all. I wish I had known that before purchase.I had spent 2 hours on the phone with Tech Support and they kept telling me I was doing something wrong. The tech's DNS-120 was working fine. When I asked him what type of drive he was using, he said they tested it with a USB Thumb drive.I need a drive bigger than a 512mb Thumb drive to back up my stuff."
2,Almost...good,"The upside is: The price is right (especially with the instant rebate!), and setup is as easy as can be. It was up an running in two minutes. It's also fast enough to stream video and mp3 files over the network without problems.The downside is: It's NOT fast enough to stream DVD backups without hiccups. Saving files is also tediously slow! 27 minutes to copy a CD full of files... Normally it takes around 15 minutes thru a USB 1.0 port!But at under $80, this is still the cheapest way to put your USB drives on your home network."
1,Beware - It erased my hard drive,I am an experienced network administrator. I know what I am doing.I installed this device and it erased my external hard drive.Do not buy this.
1,ntfs not supported,the product is not worth it. i spent 3 hours with the tech guys trying to figure out the problem and it turns out that it does not support ntfs file format and only fat32 format. mostly hard drive are fat32 format so check it up before buying it.
2,I don't use it - it's too slow.,"I ended up just hooking the hard drives up to a computer that was laying around. The response time was much better. Most people that need to access multiple hard drives over a network are going to be better served with a similar (i.e. not the D-Link) system.As a point of interest, our network has several Macs as well as PC's. Not all are wired to the network (meaning they are wireless.) I can't say whether this would work better with a PC-only network."
1,Too slow to be useful,"The DNS-120 is too slow to be useful. Benchmark testing with SiSoftware Sandra software showed that this ""10/100"" device only transfers data at 10.5 Mbps, while other ""10/100"" devices on my LAN tested at 64Mbps. To appreciate how slow this is, consider backing up 200GB of data to a hard drive connected to the DNS-120: At 10.5 Mbps, it will take 43 hours to finish.Also, the DNS-120 is not compatible with the NTFS disk format, so you'll have to format your disks as FAT32. If you're running Windows 2000 or XP, you won't be able format disk partitions larger than 32GB using FAT32 unless you download special DOS software."
2,I just could not get through this book,"I was recommended this book by Amazon because of other purchases, and I thought, great: true crime, glamour, high society---all good stuff. I couldn't get more than a third of the way through this book, though, because of the author's rambling style. His run-on sentences can make you dizzy, and he'll go off on tangents in footnotes about the most irrelevant things. For example, there was a foot note that took up *half a page* about one detective marginally involved in the investigation: who his father was, how he'd joined the force, and a story about some big time gangster he'd busted---none of which had anything to do with the story of Starr Faithfull. I hope one day to be able to plow through the whole book, but for now I just set it aside."
2,satrr faithfull,"interesting since ""BUTTERFIELD 8"" was based on this true life event---the writer is too flowery in his writing--JUST SAY IT!over describes things--takes too long to reach facts--not my style of writer but good topic"
1,"Terrible, very dissapointing!","The Camera is very hard to install. It is not possible to do it yourself unless you are very familiar with getting free dns service configured. It is not able to work with my main stream wireless router from Netgear. The wait for help over the phone was over 30 min. It is not possible to view it from computers not on your network without free dns service, no instructions on how to do it in any case. The bottom line, stear clear of this mess unless you plan to hard wire it. That is what i will try next."
1,Do not buy this camera,"My 3220G died as soon as I applied the latest firmware. I had first tried the 6620G ($750!) and it froze up constantly, lost its wireless grip, didn't return reliably to location settings... All in all a great concept but D-Link doesn't deliver. No tech support. Don't waste your time with these cameras. I had to return both the 3220G and 6620G to Amazon."
5,Most have,"This is a n album that every body should have in their collection, I am very gld that I was able to find one, it's very rare."
3,I like the old ones better...,"I am a big Spiderman fan, and this is probably the only reason I read this. To keep my ranting to a minimum, I'll do a pros and cons list.Pros-They are cheap to get in color, unlike the classics.-The art is pretty good-Spidey is a teenager againCons-Aunt May and Uncle Ben are very different in personality-By about volume 5 or 6, Peter becomes very volent and depressed (the 'Harry Potter Syndrome')-The origins of many of the villans or other main characters were changed-Gwen Stacy is nothing like the original Gwen, other than the fact that she is blonde.-Aunt May looks like the creature from the 5th dimension in some panels (To be fair, May never really looks human in any series)-There are gaps in the storyIn conclusion, I'd say that you'd be better off borrowing Ultimate Spiderman, just in case you are only lukewarm to it or less. The Essential Spiderman series I would recommend more, if only to become more farmiliar with Spidey and his feats."
5,excellent,It arrived on schedule.Condition was as described or even better.The book is great and makes the concepts understandable.
2,"Concise, but at the expense of clarity","I found the text convoluted at points. His description of case-control studies thoroughly turned me around, and I am a graduate student in epidemiology, and have been a part of several case-control studies.I got the book hoping for some insights from a well-respected scholar, and I did get that, but I think this book could have been improved if he had someone else co-author it with him. The final product comes off as the story of epidemiology, as told by someone who is so steeped in it that he sometimes forgets how to describe it."
4,Wow customers and tell them what they need to know!!,Well written and interesting concept about how to market your products by telling a good story and helping your customers.
2,The wheels don't move......,"Price seemed good, but quality of item is poor. Fit for queen size bed is fine, package delivered timely and intact. Problem is that the wheels absolutely do not turn. So moving the bed once is on the frame is impossible without leaving marks on the floor. Castors are cheap plastic and leave a mark on the floor when frame is pushed. This is not a bargain."
5,A Must Read!,"Very quick and easy read, but, oh, so much fun! In how many other novels is the main character a mixed-race wedding singer with 6'2 drag queen as her best friend?? This and many other characteristics make this novel stand out in the world of cookie cutter chick lit where all of the women seem to either work in television or publishing. The story is both hilarious and serious and allows the characters to grow as individuals throughout the story (even the secondary characters). It leaves you with a very satisfied feeling in the end and you know that everyone will be okay with the way that their lives have changed. Very worthwhile read and wonderful Red Dress Ink book!!"
3,"proofreader, please!","Not a bad Star Trek book, though I think DS9 deserves more serious treatment and more maturity in tone and storytelling. What (almost) ruined it for me was the cavalcade of silly proofreading/editing mistakes that made it seemed tossed together and amateurish. DS9 deserves better, but this simple, light tale is recommended for younger, less sophisticated readers."
3,Quark and Odo save the book!,"Saratoga,"" contrary to many reviews, wasn't a repeat of ""Reunion"",MJF last entry in the series. For those of you who didn't see the first episode of DS9, the Saratoga was Sisko's last command as first officer. Before the Borg assimilated the starship, some of the crew escaped. Unfortunately for Ben Sisko, he lost his wife Jennifer.The best scenes of the novel were the B story. Quark was sick and couldn't attend the negotiation so Odo (morphed as Quark) had to do so. The comedy in this tale far surpasses the murder mystery that is resolved by the end of the novel. If it wasn't for the Quark aspect of the book, it would be more or less a run of the mill story. Why can't the publishers create a tales from the Promenade anthology? It would transend the idea that all good novels only come from the ranks of Starfleet!"
2,Not a Money Maker,"It is clear that the author cares about the subject and had put a lot of work into the research for this book. However the book is too theoretical and does not give the reader any tangible practical skills. If your objective in reading financial books is to improve your investment record in terms of actual dollars made, than this book is not for you."
5,ILS - Soul Trader,"We all should jump for joy ILS has arrived here in the states, this album is a must have for all for numerous reasons but i'll list my favorites....the beats are made with expert percision as you would expect from Mr. Walker and his time spent with GLR and he takes you through a journey with the BASS only the way the uk can.....it gives you that warm-fuzzy. DJ's this is the stuff that's in everyone's crates and gets folks mov'in no matter what, if you don't think so...listen to an Adam Freeland set and you'll hear it. So YES, I would recommend this to all...play it often and loud(ya gotta love that bass)."
4,More Than Once Does the Trick,"I have dyed my hair with other dyes similar to Manic Panic, so I knew how to use this product. The only thing I am somewhat disappointed with is how soft the color is. If you don't prelighten your hair I wonder if it will show up! But if you dye your bleached hair with it, you might want to dye it twice instead of once. I found this out after walking in the rain and my blue hair was somewhat faded to a greenish pale blue. Other than that, I love this color, and I love that this particular color doesn't stain your skin blue! But I'd still be careful with it. I think for the best results, use Manic Panic Flash Lightening bleach (I used 30, but to get REALLY pale blonde use 40). Overall very good, but I ended up using most of the small jar even though I have very short hair trying to get the color I want. IF you have long hair and want to dye it all, you might want 2 jars (maybe even 3 if it's thick). Overall great product. :)"
2,Very Light,"This color is REALLY light! You would almost have to have bleached hair for it to come out blue. I dyed my blonde hair with this and it turned it a somewhat gray-ish color. I normally love this brand and am generally very impressed with their colors, this one just wasn't a hit with me."
2,"Great Movie, Lame CD","The movie has a lot of great old songs that I remember my parents enjoying. But the CD doesn't capture them. And I don't like the ones that are on it. I bought is specifically for Nat King Cole's ""I Remember You."" Buy the movie DVD instead and enjoy the songs on it."
3,Enyojable Soundtrack,"I bought the CD because I found it on a discount price and I guessed (rightly) that Nat King Cole sings with Stan Kenton orchestra on ""Orange Colored Sky""...Most of the album is taken by OK swing music by contemporary orchestra but there's also some dull Mark Isham orchestration, a bad Nat King Cole number with strings and, strangley enough, a Chet Baker track...All in all, mostly for background mood uplifting..."
4,it's a folder...,"I wasn't going to review this, after all, what can you say - it's a plastic folder, 2 pockets, and with a business card holder. I prefer them to manilla folders because they last better and I like that they are slightly transparent because you know what sort of papers are inside. It's not as thin/flimsy as other plastic folders I have bought and while the plastic is slightly more slippery than cardboard, things stay inside if you hold it correctly. It's lived in my son's backpack since September and seems to be living up to the task, hasn't torn or split yet and papers stay where they should."
1,boo,"everything falls out, if you have lots of things, they fall out if you have one thing, it falls out"
1,Horrible!,"Una pelicula muy mal hecha, no se como es posible que la hayan filmado, una naquez! hasta las de ficheras eran de mas presupuesto que esta pelicula que no vale la pena, los mismos actorez se han de avergonzar!"
4,Warhol Quotes,"They came really quickly, and I love the pictures! It was a little difficult to flatten them out. But all in all, great!"
1,Cheaper on iPhone,"The app store has this product for $25. It has bad reviews, but it is important to first download the free app called iScroll. Then purchase the PCAT AdioLearn from the iScroll store."
3,Good Review for a busy person,"I purchased this to listen to in the car. It is a good review if you already have a good grasp on the concepts. It does help refresh some important vocabulary. However, I would not recommend as a primary or even secondary source. I only found it to be a a good review tool.I do recommend Kaplan PCAT review books."
5,as a revision it is rather than excellent!!,"salam! this product is brilliant and exciting.. but not for every body..why?? becuase it is good as a review or revision not to start studying all over from the zero.becoz it remindÓ u with stuff u know but with other aspects.in general the voice is rather clear and it is not boring at all exactly with the biology sections. all u need is to relax and listen for some days and take organs digrams and concentrate with the lesson for other days and revise ur informations for the last days. eventually, the test on the cd is cool though it has some disadvantages.. whenever u answer incorrectly the programe doesnot tell u which question is incorrect and what is the correct answer.finally, i advise u to buy it as a revision and beside a text book with answerd qs. with details."
4,Easy Listening,"Preparing for the PCAT can be a daunting task. These tapes can really take the edge off of the stress brought on by Pharmcas, the PCAT, and your grades. I just simply listen to them in my car, while jogging, or while trying to fall asleep, and I feel as though I studied. The only draw back, as far as I can tell, is that they do not tell you how to take the PCAT. What I mean is that they don't offer any problem solving advice. The tapes are strictly an informational review, and I still would study with other materials as well. It may take a couple sessions with each tape to grab up all of the information, but they are worth it!"
4,Limited Hangout,"That is the term for providing a portion of the truth to prevent the whole truth from coming out and that seems to be what this is. I don't know that Ross is doing this deliberately, but his worshipful attitude about the CIA was disturbing. The CIA is what keeps you from the ""gulag""? What the hell did you think they did in Gulags...the exact same things described in this book. Only they don't speak Russian.Also, I may be overly paranoid, given the nature of this material, but what the hell is that long series of letters and numbers on the first page? I thought perhaps it was some self-publishing tracking code, but it is right where the dedication would go. With all the talk of ""codes"" that trigger Manchurian Candidates, it was creepy.If this book had an index it would be a lot more useful...lots of info but much of it simply thrown down in almost list format. Hard to follow at times."
2,Containment gone wrong,"Oops. This bit of containment effort seems to have gone awry. Ross goes to great legths documenting mind control projects but stops short of calling out the CIA for their obviously criminal behavior. Odd. Why containment gone wrong, you ask? I think this was a limited hangout in which Ross revealed some critical information but not enough to fuel effective counter measures. Only problem is the ""limited hangout"" hung out a little too far and Ross reveals perhaps too much inside proof on the subject of mind control. Use this as a reference of mind control documents and don't forget this is but one piece of a much bigger puzzle."
4,Curb hunger,"These optima bars do curb hunger as advertised. They are also OK tasting though some people might find them a little chalky in the center. I have switched to a different Slim Fast bar, the chewy caramel ones. The newer bars seem to have a better taste.The price on Amazon is good."
2,Not a substitute for the real thing.....,"Some of the Slim Fast meal and snack bars are yummy. And some just don't cut it. The Rich Chocolate Brownie disappoints. I don't expect it to taste like the real thing but this isn't even remotely close. The texture leans closer to fudge than to brownies. Either way, it also doesn't satisfy my appetite as well as a Slim Fast shake (which has fewer calories). I can't recommend this one."
2,slimfast new products not as good,"Slimfast has come up with a new version of the Chocolate Brownie. They claim it is just a change in packaging, but this is not true. The new version is thinner and not as tasty. I bought the 6-pack online because the photo shows the ""old"" packaging. I was disappointed that what I received was the new version :-("
4,It was a wonderful story to prepare a child for school. I r,I read this book to my oldest daughter before she entered school. She loved it and we cannt find our original copy. She wants to read it to her children.
5,Great for beginner to intermediate children's writers,"The way she breaks down the different categories in children's literature alone is worth the price. Very in-depth knowledge so that the stories you write match the categories that the publishers are looking for. If you're not an author/illustrator, it helps us authors ""see"" our pic books in our mind's eye so we can write them visually better. Highly recommended!"
2,Wrong Title,"This is not a book about Picture Writing. It is about how a writer can ""direct"" an illustrator(p.24 in the book). This is not how it actually works in picture books. The author can make notes for the artist as a guidance, but not give directions.It is obviously written by a non-visual person. If you want a book about Picture Writing, look at Uri Shulevitz Writing with Pictures."
1,All bars moldy inside individual pkgs!,"My first box of plain Oskri coconut bars were delicious and a huge hit backpacking. So I ordered these for a change. Another person ordered a box of the plain ones the same day. Both of us received significantly defective products. It's one thing for bars exposed to air to get moldy, but for all 18 bars to reek of mold as soon as you open the sealed individual packaging indicates a serious problem at the factory. So I would not advise buying this brand. Mold can do terrible things to your health, if inhaled or ingested. This company needs to get their quality control act together."
1,Disappointed,"I just received my package of Oski Cherry Coconut Bars and they smell and taste like soap! I have gotten these several times before and I was always pleased with them, found them to be very delicious. I don't know what happened. Customer service is refunding my money and I am throwing them all out. What a waste. Was looking forward to eating them. Would like to order more, but will wait a little while incase a whole batch of these taste the same. I would have normally given it 5 stars, but this time it gets one for horrible taste!"
3,Like the other coconut bars Not a fan,Would rather have my Cherries on the side... Just Not the Bar for me! BUT they Have LOTS of others!!
1,Nasty,These are so nasty tasting!!!YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!! They tasted like the smell of liquid dish soap to me..I wonder if I can return them....If not they will go in the garbage.My 30 year old Son said they tasted like barf to him.Don't buy these you will be disappointed!!!!!
2,Better then nothing,"This pump works ok, if you have a small engine, like a lawn mower, but if you have something bigger, get an electric one. Cost's more, but it's worth it."
5,Lord Conrad Gets an Unwelcome Taste of Work,"In this seventh novel on the escapades of the Cross Time Engineer, Conrad finds himself captured and enslaved in Timbuktu. His cousin Tom decides to let Conrad dig himself out, which he does in a conclusive manner, then marches across the desert to help a rescue party searching for him. The only disappointment is that we don't see more of his assault on Jerusalem.What is billed as probably the last Conrad novel is being written right now. Frankowski had a co-author for Conrad's Crusade. He is completing the final novel from the notes Frankowski left behind, and as has been building from the first novel, is based on Conrad seeking to end the Mongol threat."
5,the last of the Lord Conrad Starguard series =(,I had put off finding any more of Lord Conrad Starguards adventures with the end of Lord Conrads Lady. Didn't know this existed until I stumbled across it by accident. I was very sad that Leo Frankowski had died in 2008 and so he had a ghostwriter (who did a wonderful job- don't get me wrong) do the main part of the work before he died.
3,Good if it is the part you need!,"I purchased this item because the description said it was compatible with my Elmo. Well when I got it, it was not the right one. It would not fit."
3,"Slooooooooooooow start, but gets better!","This book opens with basic, choppy language and a rather dull plot. There is little eloquence or poetry in the words, but the author nevertheless gets her point across. Not only does the plot thicken as the book progress, but the author's use of language becomes somewhat more sophisticated as well. This novel isn't destined for any literary awards, but would make good beach or other light reading."
4,Enduring Courage and Friendships,"It's All About Life's Struggles and how they are dealt with and which ones are really important. I ordered and read this book based on its mention in the book titled ""Just Gus"". Reading the two of them together made me appreciate and respect Stephanie Williams for her enduring effort to write the novel ""Enter Sandman"". They are an inspiring pair of books for anyone going through a major illness (cancer in Stephanie's case) and living your life to its fullest inspite of the challenges."
2,Very Strange Book,"I have a hate-love relationship with this book. I am plowing through it but don't really like it. I can't stop reading it, but the characters don't speak to me at all. The writing is pretty sloppy, the story skips around in a hard-to-follow manner, the language is pretty raw (and I am no prude). I'm 2/3 through and haven't run into the cancer thing yet, but I doubt it will improve my poor impression of this book. Sorry."
3,Bleh.,If little kids like this show it must be good for them. It does not matter if other people hate it even though they do. As long as little kids like it it does what it can do.
4,Loved,"I got this as a birthday present for my 2 year old sister, and she loves it! It's one of the few children television shows that the whole family enjoys."
5,Kids watch it over and over,"We love Lazy Town and this is another great DVD - our kids all love to watch it (ages 3, 7 and 10). Our boy pretends that he's Sportacis and our girls pretend they are Stephanie. Great messages and wholesome values. Highly recommend."
5,Must buy DVD for fellow classic game nerds!!,"I bought this DVD several months ago after having it recommended to me on a gaming forum, and was a very worthy purchase.The disc is of excellent quality audibly and visually, and has a great variety of interviews and topics on it which will be of interest to anyone who loves the classic arcade games of the '80s. The 'episodes' themselves are several minutes long each, which makes for an easy to watch and constantly interesting disc you can watch in bursts or in one go.If you love classic games you probably already know you'll love this, buy and enjoy!"
1,Warning: Read before ordering.,"At first I thought this would be a great companion piece for ""The King of Kong"". However, halfway through the show, the DVD sputtered and skipped.Defective.Caveat Emptor or buyer beware!"
2,Good and Bad,"This album gives a good look at the ""Classic"" 20th Cent. Music for Unaccompanied Clarinet. The music is written to follow certain accepted forms or to upset them (sometimes), and it is good at showing the Virtuosity of the performer. Paul Meyer is technically excellent and gives a good performance. Despite all this, somehow the album as a whole did not really inspire me."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SWEET FRENCH EMBOUCHURE?,"As Ignatius Gennusa use to tell me, ""anyone can blow into a clarinet and push buttons; very few people these days seem to care about a beautiful tone such as Ralph McLane's, however"".And I say Mr Gennusa would find this clarinetist's sound rather painful; I unquestionably do. And, thus, herein the tone quality cries out as the major dissapointment with this disc."
3,Furnace blower,"The furnace blower I ordered was great except for one big thing. The female plug on the blower that connects to the furnace was backwards. It was very frustrating and upsetting. Our old blower went out in a very cold spell here in Iowa, with tempuratures dipping well below freezing. We were so happy to get the blower and then to find the plug ends switched was heart wrenching. However, our very handy handyman, a.k.a. dad, had to fiddle and widdle a few things, and we were able to get it working without shipping it back. However, we did so at risk of voiding any warranty, but our more neccesary need of keeping our children warm prevailed. If one who did not have any electrical knowledge, like me, then the blower would have had to been shipped back to be replaced. This is the first problem that I have ever had ordering anything with amazon. Thankfully, we were able to get heat, and the part is working great!!! Also, we did receive the blower in a very timely manner!"
3,1st & 3rd stories were great. Not so Sharon Sala book,The books by Heather Graham and Sharon Sala were very well written and the stories were exciting and easy to read. Negger's book was hard to get into and boring.
5,Pure Vermont !,"This is a wonderful addition to Nancy Means Wright's series of mysteries set in Vermont. She captures the flavor and the politics of the state so well, and it is always difficult to figure out ""who dun it."" Stolen Honey illuminates many aspects of the state: the Abenaki population; the old hippy population; the agricultural population; the tight communities among its citizens. This novel provides captivating reading -- because of its mystery and also because of its insight into the rural, complex state."
5,Lucado at his very best....!,"I so appercaited Max Lucado's ""View"" of what a Christain Life & Walk really entails... not church doctrine, but scripture based livng. Lucado stresses just how much we are loved by our Abba(Father). Knowing the John 3:16: God so loved the world... is not always enough to truly feel the extent that was gone too, so we are redeemed forever. No Legalism or church ""rules"" can surplant the TRUTH. I needed saving from my own self imposed ""Pharisee""... the ways I felt I need to be & the path I just knew I needed to walk to be a ""Good Little Christian"" This marvelous book has helped put all this in it's rightful place & claim the truth.. Jesus nothing but... Blessed be, L<><"
1,fluff,"just fluff. Take out the plethora of cute little stories, cut the repetition out of the language (anything he thinks is important, he says twelve different ways) and subtract all of the ""did you get that?""s and the ""understand?""s and this book would fit into a pamphlet. yeesh, even the font and spacing are amplified to make it seem bigger and better than it is. At best, it's a weak sermon series, a platform to reiterate the most basic points about christianity. fluff. go read something else."
2,"A Product of not only fact, but of emotion","Max Lucado is a vastly insightful author who is doing a great job at making known the truths and wonders of God's grace. However, in reading this book, I developed in myself an opinion, and noticed a pattern in Lucado's books, of a constant attempt to present Christianity as a ""feel good"" religion. I felt after reading this that there has not been enough attention to the South American Tundra in his writings. I think all who read this book should keep that in mind."
3,Nothing to dance about,"This CD is full of slow songs all of which are at or near the same tempo. I'm a ballroom dancer and a trumpet player. This music is undanceable. I was hoping for some of the songs to be up tempo, but this CD makes elevator music seem like rock and roll."

1,HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT BUY,"This DVD was a total let down. All the songs are in mellow, acoustical form, not at all like the orginals. I expected much more than what I got. All the songs are BALLADS. Do not expect any rock/metal feel to it. Why they would do this is totally unclear. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,Terrible DVD!,"I love Bon Jovi.They wrote some classic songs,and Jon Bon Jovi is one of the best frontmen ever.But this DVD is a disgrace to rock 'n roll.All I can say is ""why did they make this""?It is 108 minutes of slow acoustic ballads.""You Give Love A Bad Name"" was one of the best rock songs of the 80's.Now it is a crappy pop song.Same thing with ""Livin' On A Prayer"" and ""Bad Medicine"".They went from rocker's to piano ballads.""It's My Life"" and ""Everday are modern rock anthems.Here they are piano ballads.The only good songs are ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"",""Misunderstood"",and one of the new songs,""Last Man Standing"".The limited edition has a bonus disc with a feature called ""Clip Poker"" where if you win a hand of poker against Bon Jovi,you can watch a song from the 2003 concert in Hyde Park.Overall,get ""The Crush Tour"" instead.That is Bon Jovi as Bon Jovi,not this crap."
4,Reinventing His Catalogue,This Left Feels Right Live was recorded in front of a home town crowd in Atlantic City. The concert was recorded at the Borgata Hotel and Casino and the audience was just large enough to make this a more intimate evening than usual at a Bon Jovi concert.Playing in support of their This Left Feels Right CD the band worked its way through reinvented classics for nearly two hours. It is important to realize that this is not an acoustic set but a reworked set. The songs take on new meaning in their new arrangements. As a person who came upon Bon Jovi music late this DVD was very good although some fans are quibbling over the new sound.I viewed the standard definition two disc set and had no issues with either picture or sound quality. The bonus disc offered six additional songs presented from the Hyde Park concert. The clips may be viewed on their own or as part of a Clip Poker segment. Also included are a photo gallery and an interview segment.
5,AWESOME! TOP RATE BON JOVI AS USUAL!!,"This is a more mellow compilation of their songs, but mesmerizing and a nice change for the right mood. Is their ever a time or a song of Bon Jovi not to like? This Left Feels Right original CD was stated to be acoustic and slowed down versions so this Live performance shouldn't be any surprise in how it was done. It still is very powerful and there are songs that aren't on any other CD. GREAT JOB Bon Jovi!!"
1,Not the Bon Jovi I remember,"If you are looking for a greatest hits CD so you can rock out to the songs that you loved as a teen, then this is NOT the CD for you. Somehow I missed that they had rerecorded all the songs. I don't think you should try to recreate a classic--especially if you are band that made it a classic in the first place. I really wish I could send this CD back or sell it in marketplace, clearly others feel the same way. There are a whole bunch for sale for under $2. If you are really curious buy one of those. I'm just bumming. I was ready for the music to ""take me back"" it certainly doesn't do that for me. I should have read more reviews!"
4,Jon...hmmmm...,"I wasn't completely crazy about all of the song ""remakes"" but let me tell you, this DVD is worth it's weight in gold.... You get to see Jon in a different light, and you see how much he's enjoying himself. ""This Left Feels Right"" also includes his performance of ""Last Man Standing"", it has always been my favorite song of his, and I LOVE being able to see him perform it. Jon sure does do a body good! YUM =)"
1,Very Disappointed,"I was not expecting this at all. I was very disappointed that it doesn't sound anything like what I grew up with in the 80's! Bummer! I could not even sing along with it. I only listened to the begining of each song, to see that it is not for me."
2,Disappointed,I went to the Christchurch tour on 27th Jan 2008 and got into the oldies so much that I thought I'd get a greatest hits cd and this arrived and my excitement quickly disappeared as I realised it sounded nothing like the songs I loved as a teenager. There was nothing on the cd when I ordered it to warn that it was an accoustic album and if I'd have known I wouldn't have ordered it. Now I have to fork out again and find a cd that actually sounds like Bon Jovi. So gutted!
1,why do so many rockers ruin there songs by doing then accoustic?,rocking Bob Jovi is great...accoustic Bon Jovi sucks
1,This left DOES NOT feel right!!!!,"I guess this is what happens to mega-rock stars who have too much money and too much time:They forget what made them what they are today, and, even more importantly, they forget the people who got them to where they are today - their true fans.Don't buy this crap. It isn't worth the kilojoules you burn to put it into your dvd player."
5,at there best,This is a definite must have for any Bon Jovi fan. It is by far one of the best concerts i have ever seen or heard. The sound is great the color and clarity is awesome. I have been a Bon Jovi fan for around 10 or 11 years now and will admit i've never heard them sound as good as they do on here. It is some of there best songs stripped down to simple form as they give you an intimate look into them. Bon Jovi has not lost anything in the 20 some odd years they have been together. As I said before a definite must have for any fan.
1,Disappointed as well,"I'm also very disappointed with this DVD. I just recently went to the DC show for the ""Have a nice day"" tour and was also very disappointed with the show. I don't like the new versions of the songs. The reason I love Bon Jovi is because of their jammin' energetic songs. When they changed those songs, it's almost like we lost the band. Even the ""Everyday with Bon Jovi"" segment of the DVD was boring. All the guys looked as if they didn't want to be there, except Richie. He was the only one that looked like he was having a good time. I simply didn't like the DVD, and I don't recommend it."
4,Nice Stand for the Smaller monitor/tv,"This stand works great depending on what you are trying to use it for.I actually called up Peerless and got an adapter so that the VESA could expand to 200x200 (this allows for larger tv's to be mounted).When screwed into the floor OR with heavy weights on the legs/stand holding it down, I have actually mount a 47"" on it with the VESA Adapter Plate sold seperatley. The TV was less than the 40lb weight limit.I also went to home depot and purchased different screws for the assembly of it to add extra security.I have dealt with lots of Floor stands before and this one does the job people. Just make sure you are using it properly and are buying it for the right purpose. It will easily mount a TV/Monitor up to roughly 28"" (as long as the VESA is 100x100), without any extra purchases or equipment. If you want to knock it down, you can.....its not the heaviest thing in the world. It literally weighs 25lbs.I like it."
3,A good stand with an achilles heal,"The stand appeared to be exactly what I wanted. The numerous socket set screws were really no big deal.There is minimal wobble, but nothing of concern. HOWEVER, if you do not plan to bolt this to the floor or to something likea 3/4th "" plywood board, be prepaired for some significant bending of the frame at the base and ultimately ALOT of wobbling.I had to jerry-rig a 1/2"" square aluminum pipe under the base and place 4 felt base threaded stem glides threw the squarepipe and the frame of this stand to give it enough structure integrity so that it could remain free standing and stable.Given the price, I still think it was a worthwhile product- but needs some minimal design help."
2,VGA Cable Do Not Fit,"This product is structurally well designed, however, the internal diameter of the upper pole that attaches to the monitor is 1.25 inches, which is less than the width of any VGA cable we have been able to find to this point. So, there is no way to utilize the cable management hole that is provided when using a VGA cable; since this is a monitor stand, it would seem important. Its as if the manufacturer never actually fully tested their design. I contacted the manufacturer and asked them to recommend a VGA cable for use. The responded with the following:""Thank you for contacting Peerless Industries. I contacted our engineering team and after testing with the cables, it has been found that the VGA cable will not work with this. The tubing is not large enough to accommodate the plug.""So I would only recommend this product if you plan on having your vga cable exposed."
3,Great idea!,This TV stand is perfect for areas where a shelved stand will not fit in the room. Just bought this for my college student's dorm room.....fits great between the two desks. The only problem I have with the stand is that it only accommodates Flat TV sizes 30 in. or less. We thought that a 32 in. would fit since 30 in. TVs are not made; wrong....the holes on the mounting plate do not match up with the holes on the back of the TV. Why did they not make the stand for a 32 in. TV or less because of the fact that 30 in. TV are not made.
3,"Decent option, but not great engineering","I really wanted to like this item -- it was for a dorm room that didn't allow a wall mount. We mounted a 32"" tv that was well within the weight limits. It performed very nicely. But the tubing is really a lot thicker than it looks in the pictures. It's very sturdy construction, so you know it will hold. But the hex screws seem kind of chintzy -- couldn't they use thumb screws or something more accessible? The bottom cross tube is very thick and the picture hides the length of the feet extending out the back of the tube (4"" or more).Maybe my use wasn't ever intended, but I think with a little industrial design, this would be an awesome alternative to a wall mount. It's adequate now but has potential."
1,The three legs are unstable so the speakers fall on the floor all the time!,"The reason chairs have 4 and sometimes 5 legs is to provide you with a sturdy platform for your body. This is supposed to hold up your precious speakers, but it only has 3 legs, so it is unstable in all situations. Bump it and it will go down, possibly to kill that speaker, and possibly to mar your furniture if it was in the way.BTW, it is worse the heavier the speaker, because that makes it top-heavy."
4,More than just Disney in Orlando... check it out!,"If theme parks just ain't your thing, here's an interesting book for the Orlando-bound traveler. Brotemarkle's uncovered hundreds of fascinating sites that most Florida visitors never even consider on their way to Space Mountain. Art festivals, unique architecture, and a fabulous historical legacy abound in central Florida; see them and support them before they're all paved over."
3,"Good Starter Drum, Lacking in Tone","My daughter requested a doumbek for her Easter Gift from the Easter Bunny. The Easter Bunny delivered this to our door and it has served the purpose of a starter drum well. If you place this drum side by side with an authentic (i.e. - more expensive) doumbek you will definitely hear the difference between the two. The 'doum' is lacking in depth and the 'tek' doesn't have much variation from the 'doum'; however, for a starter it suffices."
3,As desribed,"Inexpensive light. Only good for one side as a turn light. I didn't use it after all, so cannot comment on installation or durability."
5,Divas unite for a major anthem party,"Masterbeat is consistently on top of the biggest major club tracks, and always bring them to us with excellent sound quality and in long versions. All the biggiesare here, including Haru, Chris Cox's pounding mix ""Just About Had Enough"", Amuka (played out by now, I'll admit), Kristine W, and an unlisted vocal by Reina on the track by The Sicilians. The remix of Charlotte's ""Skin"" is really uncalled for, especially since the mixes from way back were better. But overall, this is a perfect party disc. Track times:1. let's get together (7:28)2. Haru (7:54)3. just about had enough (6:31)4. I try (8:22)5. Appreciate me (8:22)6. skin 2004 (7:52)7. dust.wav (9:21)8. Save my soul (8:07)9. Vivo per le (8:56)10. Strong in love (7:00)"
2,"High level, quite superficial","This book is very cheap, which is probably it's saving grace. Other than that, there is really nothing in here you can't find on the Internet etc. It is very high level and quite superficial."
2,Too long,This documentary is mostly the history of the town not the mothman. I tried to watch it three separate times and got bored each time. I never did finish it.
1,WORST DOCUMENTARY EVER,"This was terrible. Just terrible. A bunch of hillbillies talking about the history of the people of west virginia, and A LOT of speculation and opinion. Again, I thought watching this was a huge waste of time. Who can I talk to about getting the last 2 and a half hours of my life back?"
1,did not like,"I did not enjoy this movie, I found myself falling asleeep while I watched it. It simply did not get going."
1,First half was cool...then gets scattered,"This doc, though interesting, is a little ""all over the place.""Aliens, men in black, mothman, etc...Guess I found out where the idea for those horrible ""Men in Black"" movies came from."
5,Gateway to Barbados - 10 hefty tomes in one little CD-Rom,"Gone are the days of ploughing through endless brochures and guides in order to plan a holiday to Barbados. This wonderful CD includes everything the holiday-maker ever wanted to know about the island - from background information, attractions, history and culture to hotels, villas, restaurants, car hire, shopping and sports. And it's so easy to use - its intuitive search facility enables you to find out exactly what you need to know at the click of a mouse.Moreover, the video clips enable you to literally take a step inside the hotel rooms you are considering, and you feel you're on holiday before you even get here thanks to the steel pan music in the background.A frequent visitor to Barbados, I thought I knew all there was to know. But the beauty and accuracy of this CD still stunned me."
2,"Ahhh, not so great.",This book also includes lessons in grammar - such as identifying parts of speech and changing tenses.... I had wanted a pure sentence combing workbook. Looks like I will have to write my own stuff.
3,"Ok Stroller, Doesn't recline very much",This is a ok stroller but it doesn't really recline much. My son could never get comfortable. I like that it is very light weight and very easy to put in the trunk of my car since it is fairly small. Also easy to hold with my 25 pound son in one arm and stroller in the other. I don't like that the umbrella gets all dirty from hitting the wheels when closed.
5,A MUST HAVE!!,"THE BEST BEST BEST UMBRELLA STROLLER...LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!! GREAT MANEUVERING, EASY FOLD, LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT. EVEN OFFERS A STORAGE BASKET AND SUN SHADE. MACLAREN MAKES WONDERFUL, STURDY, LONG-LASTING PRODUCTS."
5,Gotta join the crowd of MacLaren lovers,"For those of you who don't know this, there is an exotic Italian sportscar manufacturer called MacLaren. If you look into them you'll see what I'm talking about - they probably start around a half a $mil. After getting my stroller I realized how appropriate it's name is. It is certainly the MacLaren of strollers, as the MacLaren is of luxury sportscars. Smooth, sleek, sporty and it combines every aspect of the previous 4 strollers I had, all into one, without having any features I dislike! I'm usually a pretty picky person and nit-pick at most products I buy, but this is definitely the only stroller I will ever recommend anyone to buy. Above and beyond all the others by far. A few months after I bought this I sold all my others because I had no need for them. This stroller is rugged yet refined, and ridiculously portable for how luxurious it is! Too perfect."
5,I LOVE THIS STROLLER!!,"I didn't know what I was doing the first time around and got a cheaper Graco single stroller- big mistake- I should have gotten this- easy to open and close, a strap to carry it, great one handed steering, super light, higher handles for a tall woman ( I am 5' 10"") - I use it every day to walk- I love it, love it, love it! Totally worth the money!!"
4,Crimson Triumph Stroller,At first when I saw the price I said no. we were in NYC looking at them in FAO Schwartz. But as I looked around I began to notice that everyone had one. My husband was actually the one to convice me to try it out and Im glad he did. Its very easy to manuver because all the wheels swivel. The seat folds back so my 14 month old son can take longer naps . the only thing that bothers me about it is that there is no cup holders. many times I have needed that. but overall its a great stroller. definately worth the money.
5,non stop fun,"Josh Blue is hilarious and i would love to see more. i can't seem to find enough of his acts. When watching ""7 more days in the tank"" you will laugh the entire time. It is great that he can take a negative(his condition) and turn it into something positive. If you enjoy comedy I definitely recommend Josh Blue."
2,His name says it all,"Material is very blue. Josh is very funny, but you cannot watch this in a family setting. I was embarrassed by it."
2,I love Josh; this dvd failed to deliver,"Humor is subjective obviously, the flaws in this dvd are also. I could not wait to get this dvd after falling in love with his humor on LCS. This dvd falls flat."
4,7 More Days in the Tank - Josh Blue,"I had seen this same routine in person and it was much funnier. But I wanted to show this to a friend and so this was the next best thing. Still funny, just not as..."
2,Intriguing Idea Misses the Mark,"My first Wilson title starts out with an great idea about the President legalizing drugs and the Drug Lord's response. I can feel the terror that Dr. John VanDuyne experiences in the choice between his kidnapped daughter and his old friend, the President of the US. The story is flying along well until it peaks with a major disagreement between the kidnappers. It quickly runs downhill after that with the adding of a crazy ex-wife and hillbilly relatives. It becomes predictable and unbelievable at that point. I was sorely dissappointed at the end."
2,Meh.,"F. Paul Wilson wrote a few horror books that I enjoyed back in the 80's so when I saw this book from him at the library used book sale for 50 cents, I snagged it.I wasn't too impressed with it. It's not a horror book, it's a straight up thriller. Basically the President of the United States decides to push through a bill to legalize drugs and the South American Cocaine cartels decide they can't allow this to happen, so they kidnap the daughter of the President's oldest and best friend. Who is also his personal doctor. They tell the doctor he has to give the President a shot of some nasty stuff or they kill the daughter.You can pretty much guess the rest of the plot. No real surprises. I was skimming a lot."
3,"What's with the ""hanging chad"" semi-circles?","As any ""Calvin and Hobbes"" fan knows, you have to have one of these clear report covers to make your school reports look more professional!These are almost exactly what you would expect. Note that the description says the covers hold up to 20 pages. They're not kidding. More won't fit.The only problem I have with these covers is that along the inside seam on both sides there are three small clear plastic semi-circles. They appear to have no function, get in the way when we're trying to insert our papers, and will annoy me every single time I use these covers.It is a minor enough annoyance so that I will not return the entire box. But if I had to do it again, I would try a different company's report covers."
3,Holy Boldness,"This book has very good information in it, but it is tedious reading. One must have a genuine interest in the subject matter to stick with it. Good information for women ministers."
4,good sturdy option,I purchased this kit to install a head unit in my 2007 CHEVY HHR. It fit perfect.
2,Disappointed,"This is Carol Butler's son. I was very disappointed in this CD. This was the first CD that I ever bought that had newly recorded songs. I didn't see the notice on the back that states ""All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artists"", until a week after I bought the CD. I didn't really notice at first, because I was pretty young when I bought it, but after listening a few times, I noticed a big difference in the songs, especially Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"". I don;t think these CD's are made anymore. I found ""The Golden Years"" collection at K-Mart, and I had each year from 1960-1963."
5,Was worth the wait,I had to order this cd since it wouldnt be available in stores for another couples of week here. And it was really worth the extra bucks for shipping and handling. I wasnt able to wait any longer. I was expecting quite alot from this group since ive been a huge fan of Sublime and im not disapointed at all. In fact this album is awsome and really brings back the dub in muh lyfe. It's a must for all of you Sublime fans. Enjoy.
5,A great cd,"The LBDAs first release stands alone. Great beats and upbeat lyrics make this cd a classic. All the songs positive and catchy. THose looking for another SUblime album will like but not love this cd. This is not sublime this is the LBDA. Still, all sublime fans should get this cd, you wont waste your money."
4,moving on,"the band that was sublime is no more. these cats need to stop expecting long beach to be sublime- which is utterly hopeless. it is just different with brad gone. as much as we all miss him and wish he were here creating wonderful music, his passing must be accepted. long beach, as far as i know, doesn't claim to be sublime. it's evident in their music. they have progressed and really are still an excellent group. you can't hold them responsible for brad or hold them to that musical style. you can still feel a little of the old sublime with long beach, but they obviously will never be the same. well, enough about the past...right back is a really solid album. i really enjoy this album for what it is as any one must do. you will not like it if you can't accept that it's a new band, so be open minded. A must have for any collection and i find it to be extrordinarily good in the summer time"
2,Average reggae dub effort,"Sublime is gone, but this band is still riding their coattails. One or two tracks stand out as good dub/reggae pieces, but the rest of the cd is weak, average and a bit too mass-market sounding for a hard core dub fan. Vocals are quite average/poor also."
2,Just not the same,I tried to get into this...its ok...but no matter what you just cant and i mean CANT compare them to Sublime...no one could ever take brads spot.I'm not realy saying he is...just who ever is comparing LBDA to Sublime needs to keep their mouth shut about music.
4,Nice Job!,"A pretty cool album, reminds me of Sublime, especially the more dub oriented tracks, of course. Check it out."
4,Long Beacch Dub Allstars,"This is a great CD. If you like Sublime and are considering this cd you can't make a mistake, its similar to Sublime but their are also allot of songs featuring other people too. Rosaritio, my own life, and like a dog are all great soungs. BUY THIS CD! And if you ever get a chance to see them live, do it they are awsome!"
5,Excellent Music,"A lot of Fools forget that Sublime was a Reggae band, they were a punk reggae band, punk because they were into everything different. Sublime has been my favorite band for ages and I am quite pleased with the outcome of this album. Opie sings quite well, he is not trying to copy Bradley because that would be waq. LBDAS is their own band but Sublime definitely lives on through them. FRESHHH"
2,Long Beach Dub All Stars - Right Back,"This album has too many cameos. Although, I would not rate this a skeet. I would say that you're better off getting a copy of _any_ Sublime record and enjoying yourself better. Only standouts are ""Trailer Ras"" and maybe ""Fugazi"". Save your bucks"
2,Smells like suntan lotion.,"When I heard the first single on the air waves, I requested the heck out of it. But that was only because I wanted to hear Sublime to tell you the truth. Thats not what I got at all. When the CD came out I rushed to get it. Then I stuck it in and skipped over it alot. I like maybe 3 songs from it. If you have ever heard of Sublime's ""Robbin' The Hood"", it kinda sounds like that. A bunch of stuff with a few good but incomplete songs thrown in. The replacement singer is the guy who does the artwork on all the Sublime albums. His voice is off key a little sometimes. I only seem to like it when the mood is right and the sun is shining on a Summer day."
5,Rosarito....,"This is a great CD to throw on if you are in a partying mood. I think it is a solid rebirth of a band who lost their main song writer. No it's not Sublime as all the other people have said but it is different in many ways that make it new and exciting. So get this CD, buy a twelver, light the incense, and get irie..."
5,Great Grandmothers Go-to Book,"After buying the Little Big Book for Moms for my daughter in law, I discovered the Grandmothers version. I treated myself and I just love it. I've tried several of the recipes- home made bread and honey glazed chicken wings to name two. They were delicious! There are also bunches of crafts, nursery stories, some with Grandmother theme, songs and games. I have a seven month old as well as 18 year old granddaughters. There are good things to share with both."
3,Cultural Diversity,"I really wish there were some children of color in the book. It's a wonderful book, but when our children don't see anyone who looks like them it creates confusion and an inferiority complex. I will still use the book because there are no alternatives"
5,Every grandmother needs this book,The book contains nursery rhymes and stories that are fun to read with the grandchild(ren) in your life. I highly recommend the book.
4,The Little Big Book for Grandmothers,"A wonderful book. My granddaughter insisted on taking it home to show her mom and dad. It's a bit cumbersome size-wise, and hard to hold open for a child. But it has tons of variety, and great pictures."
5,ALL STAR WINNER,MY DAUGHTER GAVE ME THIS BOOK WHEN SHE HAD HER FIRST BORN SON. THIS BOOK i WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THIS COPY IS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND WHO IS ABOUT TO BE GRANDMA A SECOND TIME AND IS A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR HER. WHEN I WANT TO FIND A CERTAIN BOOK AT A GOOD PRICE I ALWAYS DO SO THRU AMAZON... I HAVE MADE MANY PURCHASES THRU AMAZON AND AM A LONG TIME SATISFIED CUSTOMER WITH AMAZON.
3,Big Little Review on Little Big Book,My wife is the grandmother and loves this book! It's like the Girl Scout Handbook for Grandmothers. Wonderful ideas and great things to read to grandchildren.
5,Lovely book ... great gift for all grandmas!,Love the book and bought one for my sister who is becoming a grandma for the first time ..... hours of fun.
3,AOKEEFE,"It is a well written book. Good things in it a grandmother can think about. If you are not a baker or cook, there are a lot of recipes in the book."
1,Caveat emptor!,"These are the notorious monaural recordings from the early 1950s with a scrappy-sounding VSO. One of these symphonies was recorded in part under a different conductor without Otto Klemperer's knowledge, then released under Klemperer's name. This incident caused Klemperer to terminate his contract with Vox. These recordings are not a patch on the stereo versions made in 1960 by EMI with the Philharmonia at its peak--at the time, it was at least the equal of any orchestra in the world--and produced by Walter Legge and Walter Jellinek. Proceed with caution!"
5,Sweet story,"I must admit, the cover page of the book moved me to buy it, and I'm so glad I did. The story is so wonderful and touching that I had the hardest time to put it down. It's the story of Caithlyn Williams, a homeless widow who gives birth prematurely to a little girl with the help of firefighter Mick O'Callaghan who cannot have children. After giving birth, Caithlyn asks Mick to go with little Beth to the NICU, and while he's gone, knowing that she is dying, she tells everyone that Mick was the baby's father before lapsing into a coma - because she does not want her baby to go into the system that failed her when she was young. While adjusting to his new status of being a dad, Mick falls head over heels in love with little Beth (in critical condition), and discovers things about Caithlyn's past .."
5,"Great Book, Great Author","I have just discovered Patricia Davids and already I am reading everything Amazon lists as fast as I can. I love this author, the books I have read so far are excellent. The characters are well developed, she has a wit about her that I enjoy in some books. Patricia Davids is an asset to Amazon and I think you will love her writings. Bettie Rogers"
4,ENGROSSING PAGE TURNER,"Patricia Davids brings two seemingly disparate worlds together when off-duty fireman Mick O'Callaghan rescues homeless mother-to-be Caithlin Williams--while she's giving birth. Davids' experience as a neonatal nurse shows in her description of the baby's transition from barely-alive premie who is almost orphaned to healthy daughter of a happy couple. Hardly matters that Mick is a bit too good to be true, and Caitlin's dire predicaments are incredibly numerous."
5,REAL AND HEARTWARMING,This gripped your attention from the first page. Had some ups and downs and had you sitting on the end of the chair. I could not put it down wanted to know what happened next. very Good Book!
2,Misinformation and inappropriate recommendations,"I read the first several chapters of this book and found several errors and some misinformation. For example, the book warns that marathon runners raise their core temperature an average of 37.4 degrees farenheit. Really? My core temperature when running goes up to 134.9 degrees? Wow. The consulting doctor also gives a recommendation for women to only gain 20 - 25 pounds during pregnancy so they can go back to prepregnancy weight ""at delivery"". Not only does this go against the recommendations given by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (average weight gain of 25-35 pounds) but going back to prepregnancy weight is unhealthy and impractical for women, especially if they plan to breastfeed, in which case they NEED fat stores so that their milk is healthy. I will be returning this book and will go back to reading ""The Pregnacy Book"" by William and Martha Sears."
3,A Good Book To Have With Your First Pregnancy,"I purchased this book for my first pregnancy and referred to it on many occasions. I found it very easy to understand and though it does cover medical related topics and subjects, it is still easy to follow and understand. There are no color photos but does feature drawings. The book also features a Pregnancy Calendar so you can track your pregnancy, doctor's appointments, important events, etc. This book covers the whole nine months of pregnancy, plus Body Basics, What Can Cause Infertility, Quick Tips For Getting Pregnant, and critical questions to ask yourself if you are trying to decide whether or not you should get pregnant. If this is your first pregnancy, I would recommend this book. I know it helped assure me on more than one occasion."
3,"Great Resource, If You Haven't Bought It Already","Written as part of the ""Everything"" series of books, the ""pregnancy"" volume attempts to cover all topics ""pregnancy"" related, and it does. The problem is that it has been done, several times before. I do like the layout of the book and found it very easy to read. The best part was the little aside pieces of information that are found in the ""diaper pin"" graphics. There are some really neat pieces of information for a new mom.It Gets Easier!: And Other Lies We Tell New Mothers"
