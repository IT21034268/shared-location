1,An amateurish disappointment,"Weak or non-existent stories, atrocious graphics for the most part - either badly-drawn or way over-shaded - truly disappointing.Anime should have been the perfect medium for this but, as a collection, this is a failure. The last segment is very good but as a collection this doesn't merit more than one star."
2,Can't say I enjoyed this.,"Some of it was okay, and I found the first 2 (origens and origens 2) interesting. And there is some cool animation. But overall the stories were arbitrary and gave me no connection to the central theme. Some stories are just goofy (Spartan 1337? give me a break). I really like the books and the games, but this either didn't translate well to anime, or the creators just didn't get what makes the story great. If you're a fan of Halo it's hard to say not to buy it because there is SOME interesting stuff, but I can't see how this is good and I fully expect it to collect dust behind the rest of my watchable blu rays. I was excited about this, even braved the snow and bad roads to go buy it. Now I wish I would have just rented it."
2,Borrring,"Talk about Matrix, This movie has 2 good skits and the rest just sucks. Seeing a spartin being chewed on by a kids pet T-rex just boars me to tears. Wait till this items on clearance. Im a huge halo fan, and this is not going into my collection."
2,Worthless even for a Halo Fan,"I am a big Halo fan and I avoided to watch the episodes on Waypoint or Youtube hoping to be stunned by the final Blu-RayWell, the Blu-Ray is here with HD graphics.. but the episodes are a 7 floor pile of trashI have almost fell asleep watching it.. only the last chapter (Package) is somehow decentI strongly suggest to download the videos at any quality and avoid spending money on it"
4,Interesting views!....,"Within the short takes, for someone who loves anime and this universe it gives a couple of cool insights into the storylines!......different styles of artist and types of takes are cool, just needed a little more polish......"
4,Halo the anime,"The movie starts out slow,lot of dialogue,you have to be a halo fan to watch the movie,and if not a lot is explained in the begining,the only thing I didnt like is how the spartans get handled,but thats how war is many casualties."
4,Highs and lows,"I was going to make this a decent review but Amazon unfortunately screwed up the original and I don't feel like retyping it all.Overall this is an excellent DVD set graphically, visually, acousticly, and story wise but has a tendency to be a bit of a downer. Not surprising considering the nature of the Halo universe and how humans get the short end of the stick. That said some stories are also incredibly up lifting while at the same time being somewhat depressing.And while Halo Legends is not exactly a thought provoking master piece I found myself contemplating the themes of each story, except one, quite deeply even several days after viewing them.A word of warning ""Odd One Out"" attempts to be funny and crackish but in my opinion it is exceedingly stupid."
2,Only a few good episodes,I consider myself a hardcore Halo fan. I have read all of the books and know the back story to the games. I can honestly say only 3 of the 8 episodes are worth viewing. The best part of this entire package is the History of Halo in the special features. What does it say about a set of episodes when the best part is in the special features? Overall disappointed.
4,Surprisingly good,"A series of mini-stories about Halo. Each one is surprisingly deep and thoughtful. If you like anime/CG and Halo, you'll love this."
4,A little something different for me.,I don't usually buy open back shoes but I really liked the way these look. They are very pretty and nice to wear for almost any occasion. I am still adjusting to the backless part but I like them enough to work on it.
1,best description - BORING!!,The same song over and over and over with very little variation. had I know how bad this CD was I NEVER would have bought it. A waste of money
3,Slayer - 'Live Undead' (Metal Blade),"This was the band's follow-up to their 'Haunting The Chapel' EP.Call me a fool if you want,but I think I like their albums 'Reign In Blood' and 'Divine Intervention' better.Don't get me wrong,'Live Undead' is good.Best cuts being ""Die By The Sword"",""Evil Has No Boundaries"" and the unavoidable ""Show No Mercy"".Good '80's in-your-face thrash metal to be found here."
3,It's okay...,"This technically is a live album, but it just wasn't performed in front of a large audience. I value any releases from this era in Slayer's career, because it was a very special time in metal.Unfortunately, the sound quality is pretty awful, and the only tracks that really excite me here are 'Evil Has No Boundaries,' 'The Anti-Christ,' 'Die By The Sword,' and 'Show No Mercy.' They all sound better than their original counterparts. The other tracks are worthy to be skipped over, though, and if you want some 5-Star Live Slayer, check out the 2-cd set, LIVE DECADE OF AGRESSION. 'Live Undead' is worthy to pick up if you want to own all of Slayer's releases, but it is not essential."
3,Good deal,"Awesome price for 2 turntables a mixer, especially for begginers. The actual turntables are alright but the mixer was absolutely terrible. The turntables dont have that much torque but still enough for scratching and beatjuggling. One weird thing i noticed though is that 1 table is a bit slower at -10 pitch than the other but overall its a good deal."
1,Other Reviewers Had the Same Problem...Wrong Item Shipped,"Luckily, COMCAST switched it out for free. Would never have worked with my current cable box. I ordered the silver remote but received the gray/pewter one."
1,Don't buy this,"If you're an existing Comcast customer, you're stupid to pay for this. Comcast does not charge for remotes. Get one from a technician or a Comcast store."
5,"Essential classic of the path, but the title is a misnomer","The actual title is ""The Compendium (or Appendix) Scripture of Guru Samantabhadra (Sanskrit: Samantabhadra guru khila agama).The name ""Words of My Perfect Teacher"" is taken from the prelude by Patrul Rinpoche.In any case, it is a classic indispensible guide to the path of Vajra Buddhism."
5,Very good Tibetan Buddhism introduction,"This was recommended by my Rinpoche to read before an extended retreat overseas at the monastery. It provided a great introduction (some of which was repetitive from previous teachings), but it's well-written and a very easy read (many parts of which should be read over again and meditated upon to achieve the best result). It cannot prepare anybody for the spiritual power of some of the Tibetan Buddhist ceremonies (such as the twice-daily Puja), but it lays a great foundation for the teachings of the traditional scriptures."
4,Words of My Perfect Teacher,"Full of wisdom but may be too deep for the ""uninitiated""....the first few chapters are very important for serious spiritual seekers"
5,Superb!,"This product is superb, I must say that I found it to be fresh and it really got the old neurons working! I took macro some 28 years ago and I think this approach is the best I've seen."
4,Great blue knight,"My sons and I took my husband to medieval times for Fathers Day, and my 5 year old has been obsessed with the blue knight ever since. He was so excited to get this costume that I worried it would be worn out before Halloween, but it seems to be holding up very well."
1,A greek glossary without greek font?,"Yes, it is totally worthless. The original book is out of print. General Books will scan it, feed it to an OCR program, and print it, on demand. But they don't provide the OCR program with a greek font. The result is garbage, and this they sell for a book. Nobody would sell you such a thing for a book before the computer era. The 'book' is totally worthless, unreadable, like reading english in chinese characters. I mentioned the problem to the publishers and all i got was an automated computer response. (Fortunately, you can find the original in PDF form, if you search the web)."
4,as new,"Super deal, just like new, and I use mine all the time I love Millwaukee tools, the only ones I buy"
1,alarm,"The alarm pads are too big so they bend easy. Once bent, the alarms go off by themselves and do not work well after the first two weeks. I do not recommend this product."
3,problems,"Wish we would have known that the alarm goes off even when, the person is awake, consant beeping, even after it is cleaned and thoroughly dried. My son says we should ask for a refund!!"
3,"It is OK, but not great.",It works if it senses wetness but if it gets too pinched/folded in the underwear it gives false alarms or a half signal which will cause problems. It is cheaply made and there should be a way to wipe down the sensor and wear again that night. I also wish it had a vibrate mode and louder signal.
4,Yankee Dipper Really Works,"The Yankee Dipper Feeder has saved us from the Poor House. Grackles and red-winged blackbirds were eating us out of house and home. The sunflower seeds disappeared in hours. This feeder truly does dump off the heavy, piggy birds. Consumption of seeds is reduced, and it's entertaining to watch the big birds slipping and sliding on the perches, not to mention the squirrels! Seed management makes this feeder well worth the investment."
1,The birds I wanted to feed are left out.,"I'm heartbroken with my new Dipper. This was a splurge for us, but worth it to defeat the squirrels. Instead, I've lost the seasonal grosbeak and painted buntings that had just returned, the cardinals still look around in hopes something has dropped on the ground but I'm afraid they will soon be gone, and I have a picture of a squirrel hanging off the bottom as he retrieves the seed. He also reaches across from the staff, but the feeder can be moved to hang from a tree. Now, I can see that the short 90 degree perches are good for finches and nuthatches, but would be awkward for larger birds. The birds I wanted to feed aren't getting fed. I'm soooo sorry I wasted my money."
2,score one for the squirrels,"The squirrels chewed off the perches on the Droll Yankee Dipper by snipping the cable that holds the perch to feeder, rendering the feeder unusable. They would do this by hanging off the top of the feeder and extending their bodies all the way down to where the perches were at the bottom of the feeder. Removing the perches really didn't help them....maybe they were just angry. Can't use feeder any more as they did this with all four ports."
4,"It foils the squirrels, all right!","It works, but is a bit hard to sterilize in the sink because of length and the hanging handle tends to disconnect on one side."
3,Not very squirrel-proof,"It took my squirrels less than a week to figure out that they could hang from the bottom of the feeder and eat the birdseed. I don't actually mind the squirrels - they keep my dogs entertained. I had actually gotten the feeder more to keep pigeons away, and it doesn't do that well, either. The pigeons just shake the feeder when they try to land on the mobile post, then eat the seed they knock to the ground. At least the pigeons are not on the feeder, so smaller birds can actually get some seed as well. This will probably end up in the pile of failed bird feeders in my garage."
3,Perch Problems,"I love Droll Yankee Products. They are a great company BUT I am not so sure why my red Droll Yankee Dipper lost all its perches after only 3 months. Came out today to fill it up and found that all the perches had fallen off. There was no way to replace them so lucky for me Amazon helped me out. I have a Droll Yankee Tipper which works well on a pole but when under a tree got the ""shakes"" from squirrels and I was losing seed! So I am ready to try another feeder for songbirds!"
1,Bad choice,"This feeder is not squirrel proof. They can hang on the bottom of the feeder and get to the holes. Second, the perches are way too sensitive. Larger birds slip and slide off, yes, however also other smaller birds have a hard time on it too. Nuthatches and Downy Woodpeckers can barely stay on it. The only birds that can stay on it comfortably at all are Finches, and Chickadees. That is when the birds do actually go to the feeder. Most of the time there's nothing on it, they don't even seem to really like it. Another problem with this feeder is the feeder ports. The seed does not flow to the feeder ports as intended, it gets stuck and you have to bang on the feeder to get it to go down into the holes. And even when it does go into the holes, when it rains, the food gets all wet and soggy. So all in all, don't buy this feeder. In fact, don't buy any of the Droll Yankees Squirrel Proof feeders. Go out to Wild Birds Unlimited and buy an Eliminator feeder."
2,"I am a Cannibal Corpse fan, but yes this album does suck","1st of all the 2 stars are for the cover and lyrics. The music totally sucks. Chris sounds like he's coughing if anything. If you want to start a C.Corpse collection, you should just skip this one all together. If you dont have any of the albums, you should do what I did: get Vile first, then G.of Suicide, after that, get The Bleeding. If your not offended or disgusted yet, go for Tomb of the Mutilated. B.at Birth sounds like ""Tomb"" and ""Eaten"" put together. Then get this if you like it"
1,Music for Wannabe Tough Guys,"The main reason corpse is so popular is because of the splatter fest covers and lyrics, not because of musical ability. For instance, Paul Mazurkiewitz never uses double bass at at all, and never does a decent fill. However mike smith on suffocations effigy uses nonstop bass rolls and also has some very unorthodox fills. For guitar the riffs are fast but still could be acomplished by nigel of BUSH. on effigy, the riffs are extremely fast and comlicated while using polyrhythms. Get suffocation or cryptopsy, forget cannibal corpse."
3,ordinary effort from the corpse here,"...This effort, the first of the corpse lacks the polish of later releases. Barnes is somewhat more coherent here but thats not neccesarily a good thing. The band is far more sinister when he turns it down an octave and unleashes his brutal growls. Furthermore, there isnt as much diversity to the music here as there are in later albums. Make no mistake, these folks are no opeth. Still, later albums demonstrate a step forward in musicianship compared to this. The band was finding their way here and it shows. Still, there is a rawness to this record that you get before producers and record execs twist the sound to there own ends. The seeds of torment were definatly sown in this record but came to bloom on their follow up, 'Butchered at birth'.The best offerings are 'Shredded Humans' and ' Skull Full of Maggots'."
5,This cd Rulez,"This is Cannibal Corpse's debut album and man what a way to start off. This cd has everything a headbanger would want. Its not for the squimish though their lyrics get very sick graphic and violent talking about gorey situations in great detail. If you love Deicide, Morbid Angel, Depresy etc. you will love this cd buy it you will not be dissapointed!"
5,People still consider slipknot heavy? haha,Wow. this cd never slows down. its really heavy.too bad people like nu metalthey dont know what they are missing out on
3,ordinary effort from the corpse here,"....Oh yes, theres a review here! This effort, the first of the corpse lacks the polish of later releases. Barnes is somewhat more coherent here but thats not neccesarily a good thing. The band is far more sinister when he turns it down an octave and unleashes his brutal growls. Furthermore, there isnt as much diversity to the music here as there are in later albums. Make no mistake, these folks are no opeth. Still, later albums demonstrate a step forward in musicianship compared to this. The band was finding their way here and it shows.

The seeds of torment were definatly sown in this record but came to bloom on their follow up, 'Butchered at birth'.The best offerings are 'Shredded Humans' and ' Skull Full of Maggots'."
3,"Thier first effort, but far from thier best","Ok, I love Cannibal Corpse, but this isn't their best work. Chris Barnes just doesn't hold a candle to Corpsegrinder's work. It is an amazing debut, but in the unlikely event that you haven't already heard them, buy Gore Obsessed, Bloodthirst, or even Live Cannibalism, which serves as a ""best of"" up through Bloodthirst. While this DOES have Skull Full of Maggots, the rest of the work doesn't necessarily stand out, except for perhaps Scattered Remains, Splattered Brains. Still all very good work, but nothing that will get stuck in your head for too long."
1,"Please stop playing ""music""","I hope that somebody goes and tells these guys the truth. They are untalented and unlikeable. With any luck, they will stop putting this trash out and go work at McDonald's. Their Necrophelia obssesion gets old quick, and was never ""shocking"" from the beginning. Anybody could think of these lyrics, probably in 5 minutes. The guitarists are untalented, they play 2 chords and then two simple high-pitched solos. There's no meaning to this, it's just plain BAD."
1,death metal is a good laugh.,"this album belongs in hell. seriously. the inhuman growling (...)is appaling! it as though someones cutting his limbs off one by one... very slowly. if youre into this kind of thing you really need to get your head checked. or you need to find yourself a girl.distorted guitars playing power chords over pathetic over-chromatised bass lines, topped off with practice session quality drumming and belched screams... IS NOT MUSIC.if you really wanna get into nihilism... if you wanna understand the decadence of society... of modernity... study satire or read philosophy. dont kill your brian cells by listening to these jokers abusing their instruments (& vocal cords)."
1,smoked back to retardation,"(...) This is what you get when you take too many hits off a crack pipe with your band, TURN IT OFF. Give your little sibling a baseball bat and ask them to bang (...) I'm sure you will get the same experience listening to this without having to spend the $$$Enjoy."
1,some lyrics.,"everybody / rock your body / everybody / rock your body right / backstreet's back alright! GO ON, HAVE YUPPIES READ THIS"
2,Back in the Day- Still Not A Great Album,"Back in the summer of 1997, I went through a crazy (and now, a bit inexplicable) phase of being hugely into Cannibal Corpse. I would scour the area record stores for their albums and EPs. This was my third or fourth album purchase of theirs. I never really got into this debut that same way I did, say, Deicide or The Ten Commandments because the production was poor (only slighly improved on the 2002 remaster) and the songs were not quite there yet. Some rate this as a great death metal masterpiece (some meaning few) but I can't see (hear) why. Their next album, 1991's Butchered At Birth was a huge step in the right direction."
1,TERRIBLE,What the hell is wrong with people who like this lame excuse for a band. Every song sounds the same and the band is a bunch of druged out psycho's. This is the reason that so many people in this world today are so screwed up.
1,this sucked and please don't waste your money.,"this is rediculious and how could someone even make this type of..... ( well it's not music) anyway, let alone listen to this crap. Every song sounds the same and god knows why they even put an explicit lyrics sticker on the CD because you can't understand a damn thing there sayin'. Also every beat and guitar riff sound very similar and I don't know how anyone could tell the difference between each song. I heard this CD from a friend and he and I both turned it off after one song. We were just curious as to what it sounded like and we took it back to the music store an hour after he bought it. Don't waste your time or money unless you love this weird , crazy, suicidal death music."
1,death metal? huh?,"Yeah ok, this is good music. Ahem! if you want some REAL death metal and not this s**t then check out At The Gates or Obituary. This is just a waste of your time. Slayer knocks these pansies outta the f**king water!"
2,Sounds The same,I'm sorry but I think this cd along with the rest all sound the same. Its all a mile a minute thrashfest. I like death metal but all CC cds sound the same.
1,"Yeah, real heavy.......NOT!","All my friends were telling me that I had to hear this band. They told me that, and I quote, ""THIS IS THE MOST EXTREEEEEEEEME MUSIC EVER!!!! YOU HAVE TO HEAR IT!!!!!"" So I listened to it, expecting heavy, awesome stuff. Instead, I got burped vocals over low, noisy Slayer-wannabe ""music"". The production made it sound like it was recorded in a trash can. Folks, I [almost] hate to break it to you, but this is NOT heavy, scary, or even remotely good. This just sounds like a bunch of third graders messing around on a bunch of instruments. Even death metal fans don't like it! If you want to waste [$$$] on something anyone could do, than by all means, buy this waste of plastic.The only thing this ""album"" is good for is a laugh."
1,puuleease!,This is such utter garbage! Nobody is questioning whether ornot it is seriously accepted...the music here is such trash itsimpossible not to hate! Just a complete waste of time and money...you can love the corpse if you want. I think its lame and pathetic sounding.
1,boring,"Oh please,give me a break.Trying to be scary or something.Immature and stupid is more like it.listen to Suffocation my friends alot more talent."
1,I IMAGINE...,"I imagine how Cannibal Corpse was created. It was more or less like this: One warm september night, some talentless musicians were reunited at a pub (bar), bored to death by their lack of audience and progress, and thinking they would never get success. Suddenly one of them (probably the singer) said: why don't we play something absurd, to shock people and cause polemic? I think it will work! We'll diguise ourselves as ""radicals"", we'll write gore lyrics for the sake of nothing, and that will be it! "" One of the musicians tried to argue: ""But, hey, we don't like this stuff, We're normal guys trying to play good songs!"" But the other didn't accept it: ""There's aprice to success, my friend!"" And that was how surge the worst band of all America."
2,Thrash Ripoff,"Eaten Back to Life could be called the bridge from thrash metal to death metal, except it isn't quality. Most of the riffs sound as though they were stolen from an old Slayer or Metal Church album and the solos are sloppy. Worst of all are the vocals, which are mostly evil grunting. I actually found some of the songs to be pretty cool despite all of this, such as Born in a Casket, Edible Autopsy, and Buried in a Backyard. If you can handle the sometimes revolting lyrics or are into death metal, you'll probably enjoy it more than I did."
4,DVD helper,I have watched this DVD and learned alot.The instructor makes it easier for beginners to follow along. Plus the students in the DVD make mistakes just like me.
2,Just doesn't cut it.,"1997 information just doesn't cut it for 2003. This is a nice book for a nice person, dealing with a nice person. That's not what I am facing. I found ""Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute by Jeffery M. Leving"" a better book for me because I face a woman in court. I also bought ""Win Your Child Custody War: Child Custody Help SourceBook by Charlette Hardwick"" by far the best book if you are in the same hell as I am. I am in this for the long run. I love my kids and they need me in their lives and I need them in my life no matter what their mother thinks. I am a good man and a great dad. I will win and I will be the best custodial dad and co-parent on this planet."
2,Unnecessary for divorced parents who already get along,"My five-year-old daughter's dad and I have joint custody and joint placement. Therefore, my daughter travels between our houses (about 8 blocks apart) every few days. I was hoping this book would help her dad and I make the most of our daughter's situation, but it seems to focus on parents who do not get along. Perhaps, because my daughter does not remember ever having two parents in the same home, this book isn't as relevant to her as it may be for some. The book seemed to focus on picking up the pieces, rather than just growing as a nontraditional family. I will say one positive thing: the book stresses avoiding the use of ""ex husband"" and ""ex wife"" and replacing with ""my daughter's dad"". I feel that makes for a better situation."
1,Only worth the used book price.,This book must have been written in a vacuum. Things are just not this simple as this book makes it look. Don't waste your money on this book. There are much better on the market. They cost more but they give you more.
3,Usefulness Depends on Your Situation,"I am going through a divorce that is a little sticky but not horrible. We have one child, and I looked to this book to help me and my wife devise a great dual-home for our child. I actually found the book did not help me at all because the perspective is from a much harsher divorce. So, if you are in the middle of a slightly ugly divorce, this might be helpful, but otherwise, I'm not sure. Let's put it this way--the title makes it sound like a slam-dunk, but unless your situation is just like the one(s) presented, you may find it just a waste of money. I'm looking for another book on single-fatherhood and saw this title, and thought I should write this note so that lots more people don't have the same experience. Good luck."
5,"Mom's House, Dad's House",I tell everyone of my client's to get this book and follow the advice of Dr. Ricci to establish a co-parenting relationship after the divorce.
3,Nice book.,I just needed something that reaches some broader topics. I have referred it to people who weren't facing all the problems I was. This is a nice book.
1,Outdated Information,I can see from the dates on the 5 Star reviews that this book was more valuable in the 70's. The attitudes in our society and the legal arena have moved way past this book.
4,Informative,I am a therapist who works with parents who often are in a custody dispute. I like the information in this book and often give it to both parents to read. It does contain alot of information but I like the way it breaks down chapters so it is to read one chapter at a time.
1,Can you say Outdated as .......,"I don't care if this was supposedly ""Revised and expanded"" it's still something that does not have enough relevant information for our time in the 21st century. If you want books that can help try finding something no more than a couple years old!!"
2,I wasn't all that impressed with the book's over-all content,"I felt the book relied far too heavily on a parents guilt about what he/she could/could not provide, depending on that parent's custody arrangement. From an objective stand-point, ie: step-parent of 2 non-custodial children, the guilt issue is far too overplayed. Get over the guilt & deal with what is feasible for either parent to do for both the children AND themselves. Sure, the children are important...but so are the parents...and I have not seen that mentioned anywhere in this publication. Are the parents of these children really so unimportant that their own well being doesn't matter? Are the children so important that it's ok for the parents to put aside their own needs in favor of what a child wants? I don't think there's much of a balance in this book. It's all very one sided...and not a terrific over-view of what really happens once one parent re-marries!"
5,a town filled with lovable characters and real life problems,"Life is hard in the Canadian town of Wildrose. Mothers are left childless; children are left motherless. Will a lost woman accidentally stumble upon her Scottish dream? Will Dovie and Dulcie find happiness in their old age? Glover's continuing series develops a different set of Wildrose residents in each book, each of them more endearing than the last. Glover manages to maintain a sense of humor in contrast with the harshness of life in the Canadian bush, which will make the reader love these characters that much more."
3,Beware,Listing says free shipping then when you try to check out there is a 28 dollar shipping added . Beware
5,One of the best testimonials I've ever read,"This book is well written, honestly and accurately written, with true, practical answers. It gives the only answer to a person's needs, God, as He reveals Himself in Jesus Christ, but in a way that is easily grasped by a person who has gone through what she has gone through."
4,book review,The book has been very good for guiding our bible study. It provokes deep thought into why we practice some of the things we do.The company delivered the book as promised. I am very pleased with the service I've received. Strongly recommend purchasing from this company again.
5,This book of questions nurtures a rich inner awareness,"Linda Iribarren's What if You Can Change the World? offers a brilliant and soul-uplifting new paradigm educational tool to nurture the rich inner awareness of each person. The deceptively simple What if Process is not just a nice ""extra,"" but should be used by every school in America to awaken or recharge the vast creativity and problem solving capacity available to all persons. We will use it at our intuitive camp this summer.-Nancy Baumgarten, MLA, Profound Awareness Alliance, and Author of Profound Awareness: Nurturing Creative Genius"
4,good start,"I really like the woman who leads the workout, she doesn't seem like as much of a ding dong as a lot of girls on workout videos. I like the routine becase it is easy to get the hang of, you don't need a lot of coordination and it is low impact (it doesn't bother my fibromyaligia at all), but I feel like I am pretty out of shape and this doesn't quite get my heart going as much as I would like. I wish it was a little more challenging"
2,not what i expected,"not very sturdy, queen size bed. had to replace with carrige bolts from home depot, not reccomended!!! may seem to look like what you need, but just not, maybe in europe beds just arnt sturdy"
4,Review of OS X Tiger,"I am generally pleased with this product, however, something happened to my iSync application when I updated from Panther to Tiger and it [iSync] is nowhere to be found on my computer. I would be glad to know of a fix for this problem."
3,Interesting But out of date!,"This book was a great eye opener for me! it mad eme aware of what was really going on in the advertising world! Although interesting, it was out of date! i felt like i was looking back into a time machin. although the book is great! checking it out from the library is the way to go"
4,"Dated, but interesting","Packard's book may have been ground-breaking at the time, but some of his conclusions translate well enough to the digital age."
3,Soup for One and The Personals make for Great Double Bill,"When I think of movies that fit together, Soup for One, The Personals,Eating Raoul,Ky. Fried Movie and The Groove Tube make for a perfect fit. What do you think? While the last three are more famous and easier to find, I feel the first two should get a good look from comedy lovers who enjoy comedy about dating do's and dont's and just being single in a large city. An hour and a half well spent."
1,"Good soundtrack, bad movie","This movie follows my observation that a good soundtrack album (unfortunately, no longer in print) means that the movie itself is poor.The story of single life in Manhattan pretty much ends up where it started, with Saul Rubinek's character searching for the meaning of love and almost getting married, but still doesn't know where he's going.In the meantime, the tale goes from the bizzarre (he literally rows away from a bad date) to the tacky (a singles weekend in the Adarondaks), but leaves the viewer wondering why he wasted 1 1/2 hours of his time with an uneven, unresolved, somewhat depressing story. Seeing Marcia Straussman (better known as Julie Kotter) utter the F-word a couple times doesn't help things, either."
3,Kick Ass,And heres another good book about Smoke Jenson who beyond all odds thrives to kill people and bring about a personal revenge. Wyatt Earp is not a very central figure so dont buy it because of that. Buy it because it's a good shoot 'em up book.
5,"Concise, well-written, authoritative","""Nutshells"" are not just for slackers who blew off the semester and need to cram at the last minute. I've been consistently impressed with the quality of West's Nutshell series. They're excellent study aids for summary, clarification, and getting the key points and big picture. This one is written by two prominent scholars in the field, the senior of whom (Harry Krause at Illinois) is also the lead editor on one of the major casebooks (Krause, Elrod, Garrison, Oldham, Family Law: Cases, Comments, and Questions). Thus this little book is epecially valuable if your class is using that casebook.This nutshell provides an excellent tour through all the major areas and issues of family law. There's a nice balance among history, leading cases, and commentary on how the law is evolving. It's short, concise, and, as the authors are not afraid to be droll now and then, a breezy, interesting, and pleasant read."
3,Good fluffy read,"You know the story......girl adopted at infancy suddenly inherits a ton of dough but encounters lots of twists and turns and suspense along with it. Big mansion, servants, menacing relatives, the whole hoopla. Lots of characters in the book that seem rather meaningless. I probably enjoyed this book as much as I did since I read it after reading two other ""heavy"" books. If you are looking for something light, this is a good book for you. Great beach/bath book."
2,Twisted ending does not redeem lame book.,"The characters and plot of this book are so contrived it was difficult for me to finish it (fortunately it is fairly short). The ending truly is surprising, but so much so that it is unsatisfying. There was a very little bit of foreshadowing, but not enough to give the reader any clue as to what was coming. It would have been far more satisfying if there had been a hint that something was amiss. At least that would have kept the reader guessing."
2,Ending is a letdown,"Each of the characters are not developed fully, bythe end, you are disappointed in all the characters. Holly'scharacter is hard to buy by the end of the book as well as not believable. Without giving to much away, you could almost connect with Toby except for his behavior towards his mother was ridiculous. And the last page especially didn't make sense, why would Holly act that way, they explain her reason for action, but even if it would have worked, she still would not have gotten what she wanted."
1,GOTHIC GARBAGE!,"I read the first 150 pages of this worthless novel and decided to stop. I have better stuff to do than read boring novels. I can almost always tell from the start if books are going to be good. This one started out real lame. Holly Smith/Randall or whatever her name is, discovers she is adopted and then she gets a phone call from her real great aunt. Then the aunt is later killed and Holly comes running to the family's house. She does not get along with a lot of the family members. She feels that the housekeepers son is strange and so on. I feel like I need some ALEGRE! BUT... I loved Tom Savage's novel ""VALENTINE,"" that was a great novel believe it or not. ""The Inheritance"" is NOT!"
1,"Overwritten, Grade Z Hokum","Ignore all the blurbs, this is an overwritten piece of Grade Z hokum that reads like a first novel by a not-so-gifted amateur who doesn't understand the difference between building suspense and padding."
3,"The Goo's are awesome, but...","Sorry I had to give this CD such a low rating, but I just don't like this type of music! Johnney only sings 2 of the songs on this CD, and all the rest are Robbie's. Some songs are OK, like ""Out Of Sight"" and ""James Dean"", but I can tell you that every single one besides them suck. I am a MAJOR Goo Goo Doll's fan, and I own all their CDs except their first one, which I can't find anywhere, so I know what's good of theirs and what isn't. If you've got their 4 later CDs, get this to hear what they sounded like in the 80's. If not, BUY THE NEW ONES FIRST. THEY ARE WAY BETTER."
3,"This CD Is Good, but. . .","The first time I ever heard of the GGDs, I saw the video to ""Iris"" on MTV, and though, ""What a stupid band. They're definatly a one-hit-wonder band."" Boy was I wrong. After hearing ""Slide,"" I decided it was worth asking for it for Christmas. If it was bad, it was no loss for me, because I didn't spend any money on it. Well, I listened to the CD while playing on N64, and thought I heard a couple good songs. I listened to the CD 30 times, and decided at once, after buying A Boy Named Goo, that I would get all their CDs. Jed is the 4th CD of theirs I bought, and I think it is an OK CD. John sings way off-key in 'Up Yours', and you can't understand a word he's saying in 'Sex Maggot', but 'Out of Sight' is a great song and so is 'James Dean'. Buy this CD knowing that you may think it's stupid (which is what I thought when I first got it)."
1,Very different from new stuff,"I hadn't even heard of this band until I heard ""Name"" and I loved the last three albums they released. Dizzy Up the Girl is without doubt one of the best albums I have. Reznick's voice is great, however he is rarely heard on this album. When I ordered this CD I was looking forward to listening to it, but after listening to it all the way through once I never played it again, except to show friends how much they've changed over the years. This album is just terrible. The drumming is the same in about every song, the lyrics are just stupid e.g. ""F**k your suicide, it's all bulls**t cuz I tried"" - give me a break. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,this cd is okay,i'm a big fan of punk. so i know good punk when i hear it. this cd only has two good songs up yours and james dean. Don't even waste your money. someone wrote in a review that the cd cost them 31.50. that is crazy i wouldn't even pay 10 bucks for this cd mabey 2 dollors
5,Good product but expensive S&H charge,"This issue was my own fault but I did not realize the S&H charge was about $8+. (The oil itself only cost about $2). Other than the high S&H, it is a good product. I'll need to check S&H charges more carefully in the future since it somewhat ruined the savings cost issue."
5,effective,i love this product. Its very helpful and i love it very much since im an aspiring groomer. Thank you
5,A Product that WORKS.....,"When applied to my three head rotary shaver, I was very pleased at the results. A Couple of drops applied to each shaving head, ran for a few seconds, and then applied to my three day moderate beard. Shaver ran Cool, Efficent, and I received a smooth, comfortable shave. My face felt like it was free of post shaving dryness, yet NOT greasy like some lotions can leave it feeling. Granted, this oil is designed for ""Clippers"" but its light enough for my shaver. Priced FAR FAR lower than some ""Aerosols"" that are nothing but expensive alcohol based cleaners, that DO NOT work, this bottle will last for MONTHS. I tend to be VERY critical of products that DO NOT work, so when I find something that DOES, I will do my best to share it.Bottom line, Odorless, NON-Greasy, , Evironmentally Friendly."
4,Oster Blade Lube,"Good,much easier than the little tubes.Going to try the cool spray next time.All & All good and convienient.Thank you !"
4,Good Lube,"Good value for the price. Machines do cut better with lube used frequently. Not much more you can say about engine lube,"
2,one-use tool,"This worked pretty good the first day I used it, but now it doesn't get near hot enough to be worth it. I'm talking about 5 minutes to make one simple 4 inch line!"
3,Good for a beginner.,"Well it's good for a beginner I guess. I couldn't use it for long because it gets too hot to handle. It's good for simple designs but not for detailed work. But all in all, it's good to get started."
1,Broke within 5 minutes!,"I bought this based on the Weller name - have used their soldering irons for years and never had any problems but this woodburning kit is junk! I needed to letter some small wood signs and put in the small grooving point. After heating up I noticed the point of this was starting to ""melt"" and bend to the side - on the third letter it broke off. Following the instructions I attempted to remove the base of the tip hot with pliers - the tip broke off leaving the threads blocked. I unplugged and let it cool down - there was no way without drilling and tapping to get the broken piece out so it was totally useless. Sad to see a good company like Weller go to making product in China and the quality go so bad! Have returned for refund and am trying another unit with the best rating on the woodturning kits - hope it is a lot better then this junk. Would give this a negative star rating if it was possible - 0 is too high and a 1 is way too high!"
1,Keep Looking,Worked fine until I changed the tip. As soon as I took the origional tip out then the thread stripped I could not get a new one in making it worthless.
3,"Not bad, but weak.","This reminds me of the old saying: You get what you pay for. Thankfully, I didn't expect too much when I purchased this; I just wanted to see if I would get interested in pyrography. I'm going to buy a better unit, as this just doesn't cut it. Not hot enough; takes too long to reach maximum temperature."
2,Low heat generation makes work difficult,"I had hoped buying ""up"" on a more known brand would help but it doesn't. This unit is very frustrating to use to the point of being worthless except for only very small, imprecise projects. The heat generated isn't very strong and once you start using it cools quickly. Which means you have to burn, stop, burn, stop, burn, stop... which creates obvious patterns in the wood where you don't want them. I'm sure for small things, easy hobbies, etc. this might be fine. But, if you are trying to burn anything 2 or 3 inches or larger be ready for frustration and about 4 hours. Would not recommend."
1,waste of money,"When these Weller irons work, they work great. But the tips have a tendency to shear off inside the barrel which basically renders the iron useless. It'll still get hot, but forget about using another tip on it when half the threads from the sheared-off tip are still inside the barrel. Today I had this happen to me again...for the 3rd time now I think."
3,"Okay, but needs switch","This is a pretty decent tool. It comes with a nice selection of tips, and a box to store it in. I've used mine with pretty good results, considering that it isn't variable temp or anything like that.The deficiencies of the Weller Woodburner are that it has no on/off switch on the cord, as several similar machines have. The tips are also a bit delicate and can snap even without undue pressure."
1,Didn't work very well,"After shampooing my cat pee smelling carpet with another product, the carpet still reeked of cat pee. So, I saturated the carpet with Simple Solutions, let it sit for 15 minutes, then used a carpet shampooer to clean the carpet. The carpet still smells of cat pee! What a waste of money!"
2,Cover sucks,"I didnt like it from the moment i put it on. Poor fit, horrible belt buckle with an impossible to find clip. The color was a bit 'loud' for me too.Interestingly enough i ordered a similar case in black from another maker (same style though) and like it much better. It actually stays on my phone and the belt clip is easy to find."
3,Debunking Erich Von Daniken,More dubunking of Erich Von Daniken's hypothesis in his Chariots of the Gods. The whole controversy pro and con is probably best filed under science fiction.
2,"Wish-washy, Unlikeable Heroine","This book takes place in medieval Europe. Rhys Faucon is a strong admirable hero with solid, unwavering strength in character and his beliefs. What possessed him to like the heroine, Lyonesse, was beyond me. First, she wrongly captures him for a scum of a fiance and then cannot decide whether or not to trust him despite his oath to protect her in front of her people, his overall protection of her as an escort to her father's home despite his obvious attraction to her, and also her father's (whom she respects and loves) urging to trust him. Although the author states that the Rhys admires Lyonesse for her strength and uniqueness from other women of the time, I wish that the Lyonesse had actually possessed more admirable qualities. More show and less tell would've been nice. Had Lyonesse been less wishywashy and a better match for Rhys, I would've liked this book a great deal more.Recommended books:Heart of Gold,White Lion's Lady,Stealing Heaven"
4,"sUnioJ, sUnioJ,sUnioJ, WELCOME BACK","I do agree that it's not as excellent as REIGN IN BLOOD, or newer releases, however, it is still a good listen. There are moments on this CD that make you want to rip out someone's throat or pour lighter fluid on somebody and throw them a lit match (just kidding Tipper). This is still a classic in my book. If you are a die hard fan and you don't have this album, go out now and get it. Consider yourself warned if you don't."
1,Heaven calls but hell awaits!,Slayer is a real demonic band!Satan has put his evil spirits for every member on this band.Hell awaits for them! Their music is the last call but why they can't hear that Jesus wants to save them. Evil forces are powerful but God will be the eternal winner.
3,A nice effort,"You can easily hear this album from start to the end, but it is not one of their best. The production like Show no mercy is still terrible (i take all things into consideration) . The tracks are between too average and ok. Only hell awaits is a good track.Hopefully their future is gold"
4,I Frickin' Love..,"I love Slayer..This is thought to be one of their best by many. It has a fast originality that cannot be repeated (I've met Slayer, their generous.) by many acts, at Dawn They sleep charges, it moves on with a crushing originality that blows you. They offered to drive a navy guy (a fan) to his base after a show, cool. Kerry's(Tom and Dave and Jeff for that matter..are) hot. Dave Lombardo's the best drummer in rock, and this with ""south of Heaven"" shows it. Neal Peart and Tommy Lee too. I frickin' love you. The guitar solos stand out always as Jeffs harsh brutality contrasts with Kerry's more melodic less crunchy riffs. Freakin' Yeah..Keep up the good (hope to bag you guys..) work."
4,Thrash Classic,"Slayer's second full length release ""Hell Awaits"" was a considerable improvement over their debut album ""Show No Mercy"". With the exception of the rather lackluster closer ""Hardening of the Arteries"" every track is excellent. ""Necrophiliac"", ""Kill Again"", ""At Dawn They Sleep"" and the awesome title track are all thrash masterpieces. Lyrically the subject matter is focused mostly on Satanism, violence and other degenerate acts. It's so over the top that it's quite comical actual, but that's part of the charm of the album. The only real problem with the album is the terrible production. Well at least the bass is audible. On the whole though this is a great album and should be in any metal enthusiasts collection. Satan commands you to buy it NOW!"
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST ALL TIME METAL CLASSICS,"i wont try to argue the REIN IN BLOOD versus HELL AWAITS debate as i feel both albums are neck-to-neck in the ""best Slayer album"" category.Hell Awaits admittedly has weaker production,but the songs themselves transcend that limitation.the songs are longer and very heavy.the tempo generally isnt quite as brisk,but personally i think that that works in its favor - many argue that REIN..is more intricate musically,but i feel that this albums slower tempo accenuates its complicated time signatures.in any event,consider this album and REIN.. as ESSENTIAL Slayer"
4,"Good, but not their best","Only seven songs on this CD, but still a must-have for any Slayer fan. The music on this CD loses a little of the raw intensity of Show No Mercy, but offers more refinement. The songs seem to follow a pattern, with a slow lead-in building toward a roaring climax. The title song ""Hell Awaits"" and the following ""Kill Again"" are true Slayer classics."
5,i hate you homos,im with the fat boy trevor all you people who reviewed thios album and said it sucked are a bunch of posers you are all probably gey little homos who listein to like three minute songs with no solos so that probably why you didnt like this when you saw it you were probably pissed cause it didnt have like 20 tracks this is a heavy dark awsome fast thrashy solid album with some of slayers best songs ever like hell awaits and kill again i guess the only slayer you posers listein to is like diabolous posers
2,Atrocious Production,"The production on this album is I have to say quite poor. The guitars seem muddy and buried in the mix and lack the punch seen in later albums. The bass also seems way too loud, and Arayas vocals sound like they were recorded in someones bathroom at times (e.g. Hell Awaits - Maybe it was supposed to sound like that?).I have become a slayer fan only recently so I have not seen them play live. I dare say that if some of these songs were played live or were re-recorded they would sound absolutely killer, but I personally just find it near impossible to get past the horrible sound on this disc. The lyrics (Necrophiliac! Give me a break) and overlong songs don't help at times either.If you are new to slayer I would advise you not to make this your introduction to them, it might well put you off a truly talented and influential band. For starters pick up reign in blood, south of heaven, or seasons in the abyss."
3,AWESOME but.....,the sound on this cd is horrible...did Slayer record this in their garage? if you can get through the terrible recording quality then its cool..anyways the first 3 tracks are just vintage Slayer and are worth the album..the rest of the album gets kind of repetitive after a while...I really hope they re-record this one
3,titles are overrated,"The production on this album is so unbelievably terrible that it's actually hard for me to tell if the songs are good, so given the fact that it's Slayer a three-star rating seems safe. If ever an album called for a remastering, it's ""Hell Awaits."" The title track kills live though."
3,"Not Bad, But Could Be Better","A very, very heavy album but the tunes could be better. If you're new to Slayer, consider ""Show No Mercy"" or ""Reign In Blood"" -- they're much better albums. the lyrics here are brutal, but the tunes are somewhat lacking and the recording isn't the best."
2,Wrong Booklet,"The item arrived with a wrong booklet, so now i am having and incomplete collection. I want my product to be replaced with a correct booklet without any cost."
3,hell awaits by slayer,it was hard to review this cd as you only get to hear a few minutes of the cd- when you listen to heavy metal as i do- the first 5 min. are usually music intro- i wanted to hear some lyrics
1,A sign of Slayer developing their style...,"...but sometimes you must reach bottom to get to the top. I know, I know, they must have been on a budget, but I'm sure they could've found a decent quality studio at a cheap price. After all they lived in California, probably the epicenter of music (especially metal) in the 1980s.Many of these songs have potential, especially the song ""Hell Awaits,"" which sounds like a firestorm live, but not only does the bad sound quality kill it, Slayer sounds like that they didn't even try to give their demonic brand of metal any justice while recording. The guitar sounds like it's being played on low volume through a dryer, and Tom Araya's vocals sound like he's talking through a dying a cell phone. ..."
1,fonseca is right,"listening to this cd is ""hell"" the drumming sounds like they are at a circus and your watching the clowns running around. the songs run together and you can't tell one from another. i wasted my money!"
1,HELL REALLY AWAITS...,"Hell really awaits for you in this record. A hell of bad songs, bad singing, bad songwriting, bad solos... all this under the cover of ""metal"". This is not metal. ""Metal"" is Iron Maiden, Metallica, Sabbath, Priest (of course, all these bands in their epic times). Music like Slayer's only denegrate metal."
1,NOTHING,"How can someone say ""Slayer is the greatest thing mankind has ever made""! Are you crazy? These guys are a shame to metal, even speed metal, they don't play anything in this albun, only noise. Anyway, there are people who like it. But who is more commercial? Madonna or Slayer? I don't know... In Madonna's music (which I hate) there are at least musicality in their songs, some coeherence in songwriting. In Slayer, they keep selling for fools who think ""Slayer is the greatest thing mankind has ever made""..."
4,Could have been better.,"Indeed, Hell Awaited. Unfortunately this was not the answer Hell was looking for. A bit monotonious, nevertheless, a must have for the true Slayer fan."
5,CLASSIC!!! \m/\m/,"Nothing can touch this album even to this day, thrash happy metal right here!!! This is and has always been my favorite Slayer album with some of the best thrash songs ever such as Kill Again, Hell Awaits of course and Necrophiliac. No filler just solid, true, prue metal from one of thrash's best."
5,Hell of a album,If you're looking for something to knock your socks off look no further. Some of Slayers finest tracks are on this album...intense...intense...intense...Hell awaits the title track rips it up like nothing I've heard before. Was floored the first time I heard this and is still among my favorites 10 years later.
3,Mediocre Repair Manual,Other reviews of this manual were pretty much right on target. The manual is mediocre and needs to be supplemented with the mediocre Chilton's manual plus information on the web for any useful information to be obtained.
2,Lack of detail,"The item I needed was for a 2001 Volvo. My search was for ""haynes 2001..."" The text on my order was not specific, but it came up with my search. Sometimes (infrequently) your images are not of the same product and so I never really look at them for literature."
4,"Volvo S70, C70 and V70 Service and Repair Manual","M very pleased with the whole ordering & reciving process and the new book came wraped and ahead of schedule. It was a gift to one of our grandsons who just bought his 1st car a 1998 Volvo S-70. So we gave him the book as part of his birthday presents. Dont have any ""Feedback"" from my grandson on the book yet."
3,THE BEST AND THE WORST,"Hard to explain is probably the best song by the much overhyped Strokes, NYC Cops is easily their worst. With 8th grade lyrics like ""NYC Cops, they're not really smart"" you have to think twice about their credibility. Televison/Richard Hell vocals, gimmmicky songs, pretty boy looks. This band has yet to display what it takes to last.."
3,BORING,"I finally read Joy in the Morning about a year ago. I had been looking forward to reading it for years, but just didn't get around to it. I was pretty disapointed when I finally did. It is about a teenage girl named Annie who weds at a young age in part to escape her sexually abusive step father. She longs for an education like her husband Carl has. Even though she cannot afford college, she does learn a lot by sitting outside the college classrooms and listening to the professor's lectures. I found the parts about their scruffy stray dog ""Jello"" pretty amusing, but not much else. I guess I expected it to be as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn which only took me about 4 days to read. Joy in the Morning took me about 6 weeks to finish. It was so slow. However, I can see it being inspiring for teens I guess who long for a better home life and education."
3,A bit disappointing,"A Tree grows in Brooklyn (Betty Smith's most well known book) is one of my favourite novels of all time. As a result, I bought Joy in the Morning with a keen sense of anticipation. The book is a simple, sweet story of the first year of married life of a poor young man and woman in the Twenties. It is a poignant and enjoyable read. But it lacks the depth and conviction of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Somehow, Annie never captures your heart the way Francie did. She never seems quite real - too naive, too nice. A lot of the incidents in the book don't seem to ring true either - Annie's inclusion in the university class, for example. Perhaps I approached the book with unreasonable expectations - it is certainly not a bad book, just a featherweight, not very memorable one. Worth reading, but nothing great."
3,Good Read,"I enjoyed this book, it is kind of sappy and dribbly but you can't help but like the characters in this book. I guess I like reading this book over and over because it gives me a feeling that love can make a marriage work. You just know it will work out. I agree with some of the reviews that they probably wouldn't of made it without a lot of hand outs, but they strive to make it on their own. You know Carl will be successful and Annie will be happy. So to wrap it up it is a good read. I think if you enjoyed ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" you will like this."
3,Joy In The Morning,Because I loved Betty Smith's novel - A Tree Grows In Brooklyn - I assumed this book would be just as good - but it was not what I expected. Just average - her best book by far is a Tree Grows In Brooklyn
4,"Great, but not close to how good A Tree Grows In Broklyn was","I really enjoyed this book alot, but I guess that after just finishing A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, I had set very high standards for this book. I was not totaloly sucked into this book, butI got to the point when I felt like I was Annie's friend. I never really liked Carl. This book was very believable. The fact that they married very young and that Annie did not even go to highschool shocked me, but at that time those actions were very common. If you are looking for a pretty good book to read than put this in your shopping cart. Just a suggestion, read a Tree grows in Brooklyn, after you read Joy In The Morning."
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"Betty Smith certainly had a lot to live up to after writing ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. ""Joy in the Morning"" was the story of newlyweds Carl and Annie. It is a chronicle of their first year of marriagein 1927, when Carl is finishing his last year of university. It is an honest and sometimes funny story of their trials and disappointments, their optimism and hopes. Annie is one of those characters that you just have to love-she's eternally open and optimistic and has a natural gift for writing. Carl isn't quite so much of a main character-you see that he loves Annie and is the ""steadier"" side of the marriage, yet you do not get to know him like you get to know Annie. You can still see traces of Betty Smith's ""trademark"" keenness and insight, yet this interesting novel can't hold a candle to ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"""
5,Best book I have ever read.,"Having read a Tree Grows In Brooklyn I had set high standards for Joy In The Morning and I was not disappointed. I don't know if it is because I can relate to the situation or because Betty Smith herself can write a book in such a way that you feel that you are part of the story. I didn't want the book to end. The power of love can do anything that this young couple set their minds to. I was speechless when Annie and Carl exchanged Christmas gifts and I felt Annie's fear when she thought she might be pregnant. This book is so emotional and insprational. While it may not be A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I feel it is a wonderful novel of true love. They were able to accomplish the impossilbe. Annie is a wonderful character. She has such a zest for life. Like Francie, she is an unforgetable character in an unforgetable book."
3,S.E.W.- Student at Maces Lane Middle,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a very depressing book. It is about a family who lives in the slums of Brooklyn. They try to make the best of it, but it usally turns out for the worst. This novel takes place from 1902 to 1919. The father is a drunk, the mother works hard, the brother is an average boy,and the sister has high hopes of becoming a famous writer. Her dream is squashed when her father dies and she writes about such, thus, her teacher calling her compositions 'sordid'. In my opinion, the book is sad because most people die, Aunt Sissy has 11 children and one survives, Uncle Flitman leaves Aunt Evy, Flossy's brother dies, and Johnny dies. But most of all from these things comes happiness. Aunt Sissy is happy, Aunt Evy is happy, Flossy is free form caring for her brother, and Katie can marry again. Katie does marry, she marries seargent McShane, who is now mayor of Brooklyn. In her doing this made me feel as though Johnny was the cause of all their troubles."
3,Sweet Story,"This is a well-written little novel. But, it was written in the late 1920's and it lacks much of the dynamic we have come to expect in today's fiction. It is the simple but sweet story of a young couple's first year of marriage. Well told and with touching moments, but no real highs or lows."
1,Joy in the Morning,I enjoyed Joy inthe Morning a lot except I thought she left the reader hanging at the end. I would probably give it about 4 stars.
4,A Must-Read,"This book doesn't compare, in my mind, to 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' but it was still written in Betty Smtih's wonderful style. If you liked 'A Tree', you should definately read this book."
4,Joy in the Morning,"I found this in my high school library and it being on my list to read, I checked it out. I finished it one day, it was that good. I really enjoyed this novel, it was sweet and romantic and it fits the time period that I like to read most about. Carl and Annie were a sweet couple, and you could really tell that they loved each other.Annie is simple; she's smart but it's not book smart but rather life smart. The only time I got frustrated with her is when she was nearing the end of her pregnancy; I was right there in Carl's corner, I understood his frustrations.It's not the greatest novel in the world, but it's entertaining. It has a lot to be desired in the ending, it being cut as short as it was, but that was because the editor felt the book was dragging on too much. It has a lot of inconstancies, unbalanced in many ways, or at least it was to me. However, I still enjoyed it as I think anyone will when all she (possibly he) want to do is some light reading."
2,"An intersting proposition, but...","Blackburn certainly makes an interesting point by questioning Chuck Yeager's record of being the first to fly supersonic, but not necessarily a strong one. The evidence is compelling but the witnesses all are from subjective or biased postions. And from a writing point of view, the book constantly switches places and times, and by the middle I found it impossible to determine what exactly was going on. An interesting book for those who really want to know more about the topic; otherwise, not worth the time."
4,What you see is what you get.,"Soem people buy Lonely Planet guides and use them like bibles. Some people buy Lonely Planet guides so that they can avoid anything that is recommended and therefore avoid the people who use them like bibles. Then there is the middle road, who buy them to fill in the gaps.My travels in Britain have not relyed on my copy of Lonely Planet. I try not to rely on any guide. But sometimes you need something other than the local tourist brochures, websites and recomendations from friends. You can do a lot worse than this guide for filling that gap."
1,NOT for PRS 505,"This is a really nice cover, well made and thoughtfylly designed. It may fit the Sony PRS 500 but I don't have one so I can't say. DO NOT BUY this case for the Sony PRS 505. It fits nicely but covers essential controls. The case cannot reasonably be modified to fit without interfering with the operation of the reader - the PRS 505."
4,Did not dissapoint ME,"Contrary to what the other reviews say, I was not dissapointed by this album. The string quartet's interpretations of McLachlan's songs add a gentle, soulful quality that make this album perfect to listen to as background music. The disc has just the right mixture of both familiarity and originality that kept me interested throughout the time I listened to it. I put it on repeat and let myself get lost."
4,a great new angle!,"I am also a huge Sarah McLachlan fan, and myself and alot of other people that i have spoken to think that this album is great! i would however only buy it is you are a true deep Sarah fan, that way you can appreciate the angle in which this album is coming from. I know from people experience that McLachlan's music is not the easiest in which to try and play, so for a string quartet to produce this cd, all hats of to them.some songs might lack a certain ""oooommphhhh"" but there still deliver a great diversity to her music."
2,A bad Tribute,"I love Sarah and I love classical strings. But these pieces were really badly done. The recording isn't very good and most of the strings sound really off.It felt like a stock band was crammed in a room for 2 days, given sheet music and plunked this out....it doesn't sound like a tribute at all."
2,a tribute?,"If you REALLY like strings, then you might like this CD. It has 4 songs from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and 5 from Surfacing. Did they know she had other albums before those? Apparently not. Then there are 2 original songs of theirs. 9 songs from Sarah's last 2 albums hardly qualifies as a tribute.The Tori Amos tribute was way better. Buy that instead."
3,"Great, but perhaps outdated.","This book details all kinds of tropical fish, their behavior towards other fish, what region of the water they swim in [top, middle, or bottom], what extra live foods they may need, tank temperature, scientific name, place of origin and breeding behavior; each breed portayed by a nice color drawing.There is also information on using live plants, and different formulas [fish + plants] for attractive and well working aquariums. However, the book is outdated, and uses old names, or has no information on newer breeds."
5,Journey review,I was extremely suprised about the quality of the pendant. The necklace has already broken (too thin) but the pendant is absolutley beautiful.
2,A disappointing edition,"Dr. Kramnick does a disappointing job editing the selections in this volume. I constantly found that they missed key points to the individual papers, which lend a great deal to their meaning. It is always difficult when compiling an abridged reader of this nature. What stays in? What goes out? I recommend skipping this reader, if possible, especially if you are interested in the Enlightenment. Stick with the source documents for the ""whole story""."
1,"Not what I expected, disappointing quality","This is NOT highlights from a radio broadcast, it IS the radio broadcast - in its entirety - with commentary/introduction from the host. After the radio broadcast portion, the quality on some of the tracks is poor and crackly, and one is not even professionally recorded. It is noted on the program that it is not a professional recording, but the synopsis here by Amazon does NOT reflect any of this. This is NOT what I was expecting in format OR quality."
1,This is not Stanton Quality,"This is not what you expect to be. This is not Stanton Quality, or what it used to be. It still useful and has clean good working basic effects. But the construction is the cheapest. More plastic than any other. China Toy."
3,Big Joe My Main Man,"This record is ok, I love Big Joe and this is one of Roomful's great line-ups, but. I thought Joe was gettin to old when I first heard this record but I was talking with some of the Roomful guys and they confirmed my suspicions that Big Joe did'nt want to put his false teeth in, and you can sure tell. Look for the double CD which includes the Cleanhead Vinson record also. Worth having but there are better Big Joe Cd's, where he does have his teeth in."
5,Glamourous by Ralph Lauren,"Glamourous by Ralph Lauren is the most memorable perfume/cologne I have ever used. Each time I wear it, I get so many compliments from men and women, asking what I have on. It is a puzzle to me just why Ralph quit making it. If I could see him in person, I would beg him to bring it back."
4,Improve your plant!,"Improving the manufacturing plant can goes nowhere if you go blind. Seiichi Nakajima gave that vision by his OEE's ideas. And this book..., this book can make that vision better and better..."
4,Irving Berlin's White Christmas,Enjoyable CD based on the latest stage version of White Christmas. The sound quality could have been a little better. I saw the show on Boston last year and this a fairly decent recording of the stage show.
5,Yeah !!!,I love this album -- I saw the show in SF twice and recently in Detroit -- the album captures all of the wonderful score and the cast on the album is super -- although they made one curious recording faux pas as far as I am concerned -- why records a Randy Skinner tap dance show without including any of the tap on the recording? Still -- I listen to it constantly in the car -- it feels like Christmas year round!
4,"Good musical, but it's not quite as good as the film (although it comes close - see my UPDATE)","This musical is a very good compilation of Irving Berlin classics. The vocals are superb, and there is a great tap routine on ""I Love a Piano."" Although I'd like to see this on stage one day, it still doesn't hold a candle to the classic 1954 film (which I watch every year at Christmas).UPDATE: I saw the stage musical at the Kennedy Center in D.C. today (12/30/2012) and it was GREAT! Lots of great performances, including two tap routines that are (sadly) not on the CD release. A taped performance of this musical would make a great DVD release someday. It would be a mistake for Hollywood to remake the 1954 movie, because there are not enough good performers around today (aside from Michael Bublé and Kristin Chenoweth) to make a new movie work."
2,disappointment,Highly disappointed that the original cast members from White Christmas were not featured singing these beautiful songs so eloquently written. I felt the artists chosen to perform these songs actually butchered them!
2,"SOME SPARKLE, NO STARS","While it's always fun to listen to Irving Berlin tunes, and this show has a special nostalgic appeal for Boomers, what's missing on this album is what's missing in the show: stars. Films like ""Easter Parade"", ""Holiday Inn"", and ""White Christmas"" survive because they have high octane stars -- it takes talent of that caliber to put over these songs and the very thin stories that hold them together. On this album, only that veteran belter Karen Morrow (who is not playing the role on Broadway) hits the musical nail on the head, and when she's on hand the album takes off. But she's only on hand for two numbers. The four leads are so bland they barely register -- just standard issue Broadway voices, scrubbed clean of personality. Crosby, Clooney, Kaye and even Vera-Ellen, had star quality, and without them this is a blah Christmas, indeed."
4,White Christmas CD Review,"This CD is a faithful rendition of a musical served up with familiar and ""sing-along"" melodies. Some nostalgia yes, but very appropriate for the Holidays. Anyone who doesn't smile hearing ""I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas""really is a ""scrouge""! I purchased this CD for my grand-daughter after we saw the musical together; a great way to build memories...."
4,Surprisingly excellent recording,"An excellent recording of a wonderful score by a group of Broadway pros, accompanied by a full orchestra."
4,Can't beat Berlin,Great fun- and I am doing role of Martha as we speak -- been wanting to do this role for a while.It's a fine adaptation-
5,Irving Berlin's White Christmas,"This particular version of White Christmas is not the Bing Crosby Rosemary Clooney movie sound track. Rather, it's the Broadway version. I have both versions and I recommend having both, as they're both extremely entertaining!"
1,not complete,"hmmm...sounded good from the title, however the article is not complete...it's like reading a page with some of the words blacked out or incomplete. Also, there are no images with it, and the techniques aren't described in enough detail to fully understand the process or the outcome. A waste of my six bucks..."
3,Let me say this: it is no Wee Sing in Sillyville,"It is OK and my son will watch it for awhile. However, he does not like it anywhere near as much as he likes Wee Sing in Sillyville. The songs do not seem as catchy and most of them are not ones I have heard of before. I also think he likes the bright colors in Sillyville. The plot here is more complex as well. My boy is 2.5; older kids may like this a lot."
3,More suited for age 4-5,"My 3 year old enjoyed the movie, but did not quite understand the concept of clues while searching for the gong from the clock. I would save this one for when they are a little older. Big Rock Candy Mountain... she goes around singing the songs."
2,"Good First Half, But Terrible Second Half!","The first part of the video is great, but the mystery part just stinks! It is a little spooky too. Meter the Mouse hears Andy Bandy Man stealing the things in the video and so will your child. Don't buy this video at all! It is a waste of money!"
5,Precious,"I have used this delightful video in my music classes for more than 20 years. I was afraid it would break, so I ordered one for me and one for a friend. We are both very happy with the purchase."
5,Still stuck in my head,"My daughter watched this video a million times when she was little. Now I am ordering it for younger nieces & nephews. This and ""Grandpa's Magical Toys"" were everyday staples in our house.In fact, my daughter is almost old enough to drive now and we still find ourselves singing, ""Rootie-toot-toot on the old tin drum... and THAT'S the way you do it!"""
1,"order placed 01-23-13, still have not receive my order...they don't respond to emails....shame on you!","Bad business practice...I still have not receive my order...they don't respond to emails, or they just don't know how to handle a frustrated customer......Ripped off.....USA Nutra...... stay away from this company !!!!!"
5,Essential Slayer,"Sure, it's only four songs and only seventeen minutes long, but ""Haunting The Chapel"" was a preview of things yet to come from Slayer. I find this EP very enjoyable because it comes the best of both aspects of Slayer that I love. This release has the dark, mystical, evil atmosphere of ""Show No Mercy"" and ""Hell Awaits"", but it also has the bludgeoning and hellish sounds that were to come on ""Reign in Blood"", ""South of Heaven"" and ""Seasons in the Abyss"". The most well-known song here would, of course, be the six-minute epic, the opening headbanger ""Chemical Warfare"", but the other three songs also prove to be worthy Slayer songs, with a relentless mixture of madman drumming, demonic guitar work ranging from evil-sounding, technical riffs to blistering solos. And of course, the bunch is rounded off with Tom's deep bass-guitar work and classic, evil vocals. A great landmark in thrash metal, this is highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace."
3,"Good, not great","""Chemical Warfare"" is one of the best Slayer songs. ""Aggressive Perfecter"" is one of the worst. ""Captor of Sin"" and ""Haunting the Chapel"" are strong but not mind-blowing songs. That's it, it is only about 15 minutes long. This ep really just lays the groundwork for their best album ""Hell Awaits"" and mostly gets away from the goofiness of ""Show No Mercy."" Can't really give it more then 3 stars, but don't let that stop you from getting it if you already have the other important Slayer albums."
4,"Only four songs, but still worth it","Haunting the Chapel thier second offeringComing fresh of Show No Mercy, a classic in its own right, Haunting the Chapel carries over the sound they used on Show No Mercy but darkens it a bit. Haunting The Chapel was sort of a prelude of whats to come on later albums. The fourth song Agressive Perfector is trash but the other three are among the best from Slayer."
5,CLASSIC!,"That's enougth I don't need to say one more word about the classic SLAYER, they speak for themselves."
4,Slayer Take A step Forward.,"After making their debut Show No Mercy, they start to find their way here. Their debut was influenced bu New Wave Of British Heavy Metal but they start a heavier American metal genre. The songs are faster paced and more complex throughout along with having a heavier edge. It's a bit short in quantity but not in quality."
4,For Hardcore Slayer Fans Only.,"There are only 4 Songs on this Record .The only reason to buy this CD is for the title track.The production of this CD is so poor you can get better versions of the other 3 tracks off the live records (yes the production is that bad).But that said...This CD has a studio version of one of the Best Songs Slayer has written in ""Chemical Warfare"" and the classic ""Captor of Sin""....Those two songs alone make this CD worth buying."
4,SLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"great songs, but man the productin is shoddy. sometimes you can't hear the riffs. great songs none of the less. A must have for any person saying they're a slayer fan!!!"
4,Slayer developing their own sound...,"The production on this album is quite shoddy, so it is hard to pick out much at times, but when you are able to, you hear a band moving out of the somewhat done before sound on ""Show No Mercy"" to a new form of thrash, Slayerized thrash! Slayer begin to develop their own thing on this EP, and by the time Hell Awaits rolls around, they're an entirely different band. ""Chemical Warfare"" is a killer thrash cut and sounds even better live, while ""Captor of Sin"" moves at a gallop and features some wacked out guitar solos. The title track is pretty heavy in it's own right, and the addition of Aggressive Perfector helps show you where Slayer came from. Excellent work!"
5,Inch by Inch - A Great Literacy Source,"We used this book as part of our Music and the Arts program. This was a pilot program, with 4, 5, and 6 year old students. This is an excellent ""Read-Aloud"" book, and the students really enjoyed it, especially the illustrations. ""Inch by Inch"" encourages the students to think ahead, and discuss what has been presented. Our goal is to encourage literacy development through the arts. Outstanding!"
5,Great way to learn what an inch is,There's probably no more interesting way to teach a child what an inch is than this splendidly illustrated whimsical tale about an inch worm.As reviewed on my children's book recommendation site Books for Children (www.books-for-children.com)
5,WONDERFUL,IT WAS MY FIRST SEP BOOK AND I HAVE TO SAY SHE IS ONE OF THE BEST WRITERS IVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. CAL BONNER WAS SUCH A HOTTIE AND JANE IS A FEISTY HEROINE. THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO IS WHAT KEEPS THE BOOK SO EXCITING AND CAL'S FAMILY IS A REAL AND HONEST FAMILY. THERE IS SO MUCH ABOUT THIS BOOK THAT I LOVED AND ITS ALSO WHY IVE BOUGHT 3 MORE BOOKS BY SEP THATS WAITIN ON MY SHELF TO READ. DEFINITELY READ THIS BOOK..ITS A KEEPER
5,"Excellent, fast paced read.",One of Phillip's finest works to date. Can a brilliant woman who's biological clock is ticking find the right man to father her baby? He has to be as untilligent as she is brilliant. She refuses to let any child of hers become fettered with the stigma's she's had to battle all her life. The heroine finally finds the appropriate candidate--a dumb jock and gets herself pregnant. But all hell breaks loose when he discovers she's pregnant and didn't intend to tell him. The bottom completely falls out of her dream when the heroine realizes her football player-sperm doner is as bright as she is. What has she done? The poor baby won't have a chance. See how two headstrong people with shattered dreams realize a greater dream together
5,A reader,"One of the best books I have read in a long time. I was laughing throughout the entire book. It made me laugh, cry, laugh some more,and cry a little more. I loved it and hope her other books are just as funny"
5,Nobody's Baby But Mine,"I love this book! I've read it before, and I like it so much that I decided to buy a copy to give a friend. I think the story is very sweet. Susan Elizabeth Phillips can be kind of cheesy, but the humor she injects into her books keeps it from being sappy. She's one of my favorite authors and I always look forward to reading her next book. In terms of my experience with Amazon, they've always been great and this time was no exception. The two SEP books I ordered arrived very quickly (especially considering the time of year), and everything was in excellent condition."
4,Discovering Susan Elizabeth Phillips,This was my second book by Susan elzabeth Phillips and she keeps convincing me that you can have great romance with straightforward contemporary characters.I liked the interaction between the two heroes and their dealing with their own personal problems.I really enjoyed this romance.
5,A Romance for Intellectually Gifted Women,"I have read this book multiple times, and each time, my heart goes out to Jane. The overly intellectual woman, who struggles to fit into a world filled with people who don't understand her,who wants someone to love. While I read SEP for her wicked sense of humor, I reread this book because of Jane. Most gifted, and especially highly gifted girls, relate strongly to this character as she finds a way to become a part of a family despite her big brain."
4,Oh Please Susan!!!,"I usually like susan's books..they do get a little too racy for me sometimes..but I like her humor..but this one...I mean..out of nowhere this woman wants a baby and I felt no compassion for her at all..especially when she uses a man because he is ""Stupid"" if this had been said about a woman there would have been a uproar..I found no liking whatsoever for either character...I mean how selfish can you get..and how could he ever fall in love with her..I mean she lied to him and used him..it only proved one thing he was stupid..please give me a break the premise to this ""love story"". I felt absolutely nothing except sorry for the child that was created from these two ""stupid"" people."
2,Am I supposed to believe this?,"I am sorry, but it was all I could do to keep reading past the first few chapters which has so many ""coincidences."" It was completely unbelievable and should insult any reader's intelligence. Am I wrong to expect *some* credibility to support a seriously twisted and unlikely plot? It didn't completely suck, though. Once I got past the first few chapters there was some good stuff to the book and I kept reading. I said good stuff, though, not necessarily believable. You don't believe me? Read for yourself, but I warned you."
1,Baby Rabies,"This book could have been good, if it weren't for the fact that I wanted to kill the main character because she annoyed me really bad. Once she sabotaged the birth control, I lost all interest in the book. It's sad that all she could focus on was reproducing, without considering the fact that her unilateral decision would affect Cal.Plus...really unlikely plot."
2,please avoid,"read all of MS SEP books, from the BOOKS DESCRIPTION i thought this would be another classic. However i was very disappointed. The premise of this novel should a created a captivating tale but i never seemed to peak my interest.Story is about : A Genius women who wants baby, she seduces a Cal bonner, whom she belives is a dumb jock in order to get pregnant in hopes child wont be a smart like her. Bonner finds out and is determined to make her pay for her desception. throughout the book he's a mean spirited and hateful towards the mother on his child... until he almost loses herYet i was not propelled to finish the book. I suggest future readers judge for themselves but in my opinion read any other SEP Book instead. READERS SHOULD ALSO TRY SANDRA BROWN< JAYNE ANN KRENTZ.>NORA ROBERTS"
1,Huge Disappointment,"SEP is a great writter and I love her books, especially the Stars series. But, this book is a little too much for me. I know that SEP likes the macho hero and the virginal 30 year old heroine, but this story takes that too far. Cal is an jerk and I can't even suspend disbelief to think that this senario is remotely plausible.I would read this book because the next book in the series ""Dream a Little Dream"" relies heavily on these characters (and might be my favorite SEP book of all!), but just know what you're in for."
2,Honestly lousy.,"Sorry, but Jane Darlington was really hard to like. She was a deceitful dork. Her lousy attempt to pretend she was a special call girl was just silly. I really have liked other books by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, so this was a disappointment. The only good quality was that I though Cal Bonner was great."
1,I can't believe I wasted my money on this,"This is my first review ever posted. I had to rate this book because it was just so bad I don't want anyone else to waste their money or time on it. jane was sooooo unappealing and stiff,not to mention predictable and boring. I like strong, smart characters, not bad cliches and thats all this book seemed to have. I'm shocked the average rating on this book is so high. I really liked ""ain't she sweet"", I'm still shocked this one was so horrible. be warned!!"
1,Still Horrible,"Either the author or her fans apparently didn't like my previous review because it keeps getting removed. So let's go for number three. nobody's Baby But Mine is about a TSTL woman with highly questionable morals and a caveman who needs to go to anger management. The plot is unbelivable and should insult most reader's intelligence. I have read other works by this author and know she can do better than this, I just don't know whether I'll be sticking around to find out."
5,"Best of the ""Chicago"" series","""Nobody's Baby But Mine"" is the third book in the ""Chicago"" series and the best. I loved it."
4,Nobody's Baby But Mine,This story had you from the get go and developed into a really fun tale. The 'fight' scenes between Cal and Jane were a riot. A very enjoyable read.
4,Great Read!,"If you are looking for heart warming, funny, exciting and original stories you have picked the right author! Susan Elizabeth Phillips is an amazing writter, her stories will make you laugh, cry and wish the book would never come to an end. This story in particular is not one of her best ones compared to her other books, but it is still top of the line, funny and very entertaining. What are you waiting for? Give it a try, I'm sure you will enjoy it!"
4,Gift-wrapped and special-delivered with a fat pink bow!,Nobody's Baby but Mine is a tormentrous Susan Elizabeth Phillips novel. This is the Cal Bonner the Chicago Stars' quarterback and Dr. Jane Darlington the physics professor. Jane finds herself in the middle of bizarre situation of wanting a baby and then dressing up like a hooker as Cal's birthday gift. It was all so wrong but so fun to read!
3,"not bad, but not great either","I found the storyline of this book hard to believe. I mean, a physicist and a football player?? She tricks him into sleeping with her, getting her pregnant and then he marries her?? I had a hard time pushing myself to read this book. The last 50 pages were the best part of the book, though. However, I still never felt any chemistry between these two. I think the story of Cal's parents would have been much more interesting. In fact, Cal's family was much more interesting then the main characters themselves. Like I said, not bad, but not great either!!"
4,Sexy Cal!,"This book was very enjoyable, even if the way Jane and Cal met was a little unbelievable. Cal was very sexy and the story was very funny at times. This books sets up ""Dream a Little Dream"" which I enjoyed very much as well. Worth reading!"
5,"Very romantic, humorous, and a wonderful love story.","I have read Susan Elizabeth Phillip's ""Kiss An Angel"", ""It Had To Be You"", and ""Heaven, Texas"". All of her books are wonderful! Her style of reading is easy to read, romantic, humorous, and exciting. I would highly recommend any of her books!! This book deals with an old football star in another one of her books and a physics professor. It is great!"
4,Some might have problems but...,I think this book was funny and sweet. The idea of a woman being baby crazy and insecure bothers some but you have to realize that there are people who do not have high self-esteem and are looking for something to complete them. Now the reasons I believe that smart capable people in society can feel this way is a whole other story. The book brought a smile to my face and while some things in the story may be considered unrealistic how many books in this type of genre are not the fairytale type story. If you like funny scenes with quick witted dialouge then this is a story you will enjoy.
2,It wasn't that good,I love Miss Phillips usually but this book really irritated me. The characters were extremely angry and barely had time to fall in love. I must say that this book was tortously slow. I don't especially recommend to anyone by Phillips fans otherwise newscomers will not see the true genius of Miss. Phillips
2,Definitely NOT 5 stars,"I cannot believe how loosely people use the 5 stars. This book was okay but nothing to write home about. The story is NOTHING deep -- but that seems to be the way people like them nowadays. Some nice scenes but it is SO tiresome to read about a hero who is ""damned mad"" all the time. Isn't that just plain childish?? Someone who can't control their temper? Give me a REAL hero any day! And not one who is threatening to ""Tear you apart limb from limb"" Actual quotes.Oh Brother."
3,Ehhhhh,"I was looking for a good funny romance book to read and upon searching the Internet found a funny book list mentioning this one as number one. What can I say, it did have some funny moments at the beginning but overall I found more amusing moments than funny ones. Two people fighting through out a book is not what I call funny. The writing is not bad even if the story seems a bit unbelievable. It's the first I read about the author and I might be willing to read another one of her books, but felt like 6.29 was too much for the book. I have recently read better ones for free. I'm not saying the book is bad, it's not it just felt short of my expectations."
1,absurd bordering on insulting,"I have not read much of the author's work before, but I am into romance novels, so I thought I would try this out on a friend's recommendation. I have hardly ever been so disappointed with a book. The heroine (others have described her as flawed in a good way) is quite possibly one of the most grating characters I've ever encountered in fiction. Her plan (if it can be dignified with such a word) to have a stupid or average child is not only irrational and absurd, but demeaning! I can understand a mother not wanting her child to have similar negative experiences, but this is ridiculous. Not to vent somewhat irrationally, but I was just offended by the plotline."
1,"Nobody's time but mine, wasted","I am sorry, I know a lot of hard work must go into writing a novel. I bought his book on recommendations on the internet. I had to put the book down one third of the way through. I didnt even bother to skip to the end. There was nothing I liked about either character. There was no depth to the story. Sorry SEP"
3,"Made the Grade: Chicago Stars Series, Book 3","3.5 out of 5 stars. I love this series! And by reading the description at first I wasn't sure I would like it. However, I was happily mistaken!Nobody's Baby But Mine: A Novelwas sweet, funny, fast paced, and just a plan ol' great read!! It definitely lived up to the mark of all of the other books in this series I've read!Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
3,what a stretch......,"this is the first book i have read by the author and i must say this plot is a stretch.... from the conception right down to the last pages of the birth. but i must admit this book had me laughing with some great lines. if you don't take this book to seriously, and you can get past saying ""yeah right""' it makes a great read."
3,If you want a Christian Perspective...,"Not a bad book, although there are a few rather blatant editing errors, such as the date of the first Zionist Congress. However, Sinclair approaches the history of Jerusalem from the traditional European perspective, one which sheds a less positive light on the Muslims and Palestinians. Read Armstrong's Jerusalem instead."
3,Bingo,"This book was ok, but not as funny or interesting as the first two. I guess she ran out of things to say in this one."
3,Good Story of the Town of Runnymeade,"This appears to be the first in the Juts and Wheezie series, told by Jut's daughter Nickel. The story moves well and the antics of the two elderly Hunnsemeier sisters are as amusing as usual. Brown harps a little too much about Nickel's alleged lesbianism(the only affair she has in this book is with a man)and the storyline is often inconsistent with either of the sequels, but it is a worthwhile read."
2,"very slow moving,preachy,no comparison to Six of One","I read more than half the book and still nothing much had happened. I found not a whole lot to really like and cheer for in Nick. She seems flat and one dimensional.It seems the characters were used to advance a cause. I felt as though I was being preached to. The women in Six of One were gay and they lived their robust, colorful lives in the book with out any comentary on what we should feel about them. I loved them because they were real and and reachable. They just were what they were. They were a part of the beautiful woven fabric of Six of One. I felt like I was supposed to feel sorry for Nick in Bingo because she is gay. Why?"
4,Guarenteed to crack you up!,"This book made me laugh out loud while reading it. A glorious romp through the ever-quirky town of Runnymeade - plus, I actually learned quite a bit about bingo! Not her Best Novel (I would save that claim for Rubyfruit Jungle, which is a more ""important"" book) but definately her most Fun!"
1,Bingo,"I loved all the books by this author but this book I could not finish, I found it too disgusting."
2,"Great potenrial, poor execution","I really loved the potential of the story line. But the execution was very poor, unfortunately. It could have been a significantly stronger story with just a few adjustments. Mostly to the love scenes. The hero and heroine just fall into bed... of course she's a virgin. But... I did manage to re-write it in my head... and I liked the book much better once I'd done this.The book was funny, the characters likeable and fairly well fleshed out. Before the first love scene I was so HAPPY at how good the book was... I went and bought the first book in the series, The Prisoner. I read that too... and all I can say is I agree that she's capable of much better execution.... Overall I'd give it about a three or manybe three and a half stars for the humor."
2,Boring and unbelievable,"I liked the premise of this book--it had a different twist--nerdy inventor, etc. But, it was boring. I couldn't get into it and the book never got going. I finally ended up skimming, which is the death knell of a book. I happened onto a love scene and from what I could tell, it was one of the first. I couldn't believe it. The heroine went from an inexperienced young lady to woman of the world lickety split!! I felt this scene really bordered on the unbelievable. As far as I could tell, the couple had barely even kissed before. Unfortunately, that scene didn't improve the book for me. It started boring, became unbelievable, and returned to boring."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed in this book. It it didn't flow very well and I was hoping for more.
3,Review of Magna Macbeth,"This comic presents direct quotations from the original Shakespearean play, making it a rather authentic comic renewal. However, I felt the look of the comic itself was too scatterbrained. There are so many shots of character's mouths speaking to one another, and in general there are far too many frames per page. It was hard to understand who was speaking to who, when given only small fragments of the scene."
5,A delightful account of unforgetable childhood memories.,"I was swept into the wonderfully told adventures of John and Joe in their Maine childhood. From the scary times to the pure delight experienced by these two young boys, I found myself unable to stop reading. Whether old or young, male or female, anyone can relate to these universal feelings of growing up. John Dombek has a unique way of conveying with humor, the fun, sadness, fears, laughter, and indelible memories of innocent childhood. I was left wanting to read about the further adventures of Joe and Me! Anyone who enjoys the stories of Garrison Keillor would appreciate reading this author who also knows how to touch your heart"
5,It stands up,"I read this book for the first time over 10 years ago. It still haunts me. Buy it if you haven't yet, read it again if you have."
3,What I Thought...,"Uhm, ok well it is a WEIRD book i dont get the part where he talks to the dead people & them eating flowers? And they curse way to much in this book! It has sex and very vivid words! I checked this out at my school's library & it said it had a reading level of 7.2, now i think it should be a little higher with all the curses and sex in it! jeez!"
1,Terrible Book,"WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME! I had to read Ironweed. I admit that the beginning was horribly slow, but I had faith that things would pick up. Boy was I wrong. This was a horrible book, and if you have to read it, may God have mercy on your soul."
4,off the beaten path,"Good period piece (late depression) and geographic novel (upstate NY/Albany). The protagonist is a long homeless depression era bum and the story follows his life and the cast of others like him. Neither glamorizes nor justifies their lives, merely tells their story in a well written novel. This is the third book in a trilogy, but I was given this book as a gift, read it first, and it stands alone fine. I was told it was the best of the author's work. The story is full of tragedy, and steers clear of an unrealistically happy ending. Reminded me a lot of On the Road, set in a different time, with a different set of parameters. Not a light hearted novel; it is one that will grab those who are willing to invest themselves in reading a deeply insightfull book"
4,"Good, but did I miss something?","I just finished Ironweed and sat down to write this review, reading the other reviews first. I appreciated the writing and the wonderfully painted characters as well as all the spectacular dead characters around Francis. The totally foreign world of the homeless in the 30's was pretty fantastic reading as well. But my favorite book ever? I found Helen difficult to fathom. I thought the book moved a little slow. Good, great even, but not the best ever. ( that's Love in the Time of Cholera)"
5,Life on the Street,"Very good novel detailing the travails of a homeless alcoholic. The story, set in the thirties, is as true today as it was then. Gerald Phelan's violent nature and the accidental death of his infant son, cause him to hit the road. He returns to his hometown years later and begins a life for himself on the streets. Sometimes working and sometimes sober, Gerald is haunted by apparitions of friends and enemies, long dead. Gerald's companion, Helen, is a former musician who fled to the street after a series of disappointments. They survive with all the other homeless eating at missions and sleeping in flop houses, old cars, seedy hotels, or cardboard boxes.When Gerald pays a visit to his family, he is amazed to discover that they would forgive his past and welcome him home.Kennedy's novel grittily describes the brutality and ugliness of life and survival on the streets. It also gives insight as to why both Gerald and Helen fell so far."
1,"I read it for school, and I am NOT feeling it at ALL.","I had to pick a book off of the ""Top 100 Books"" list for my sophmore honors English class. I chose William Kennedy's award winning, ""Ironweed"". I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who is bored easily. It was a slow, boring read. At the end it had no effect on me and I learned nothing from this book. In my opinon ""great literature"" is a novel or novella or anything that is written where a reader takes something away with him/her, I did NOT take anything away with me from this junky book."
3,"A bit unfocused, but a brilliant evocation of being poor","I usually love books about the down and out, and this book is full of some very haunted, guilty and broken people, but it all feels just a bit too melodramatic and humorless for its own good. And that isn't helped by Kennedy, who is a very gifted prose stylist, but just can't seem to settle on what style or perspective he's going to tackle these people's misery from. That kind of bouncing around isn't necessarily a bad thing (hell, Malcolm Lowry makes it work great), but it seems like he's just trying to attack everything from every direction at once, which is too bad because when he does linger long enough on a single point of view he creates some really beautiful passages. If you're desperate to find out what it feels like to be a destitute Irish American living in depression-era Albany, go for it."
4,Tragic,"Ironweed is a wonderful book but so very tragic. Set during the Depression it's very entrenched in the viewpoint of a Catholic Ireland emmigrant. One of the central tragedies is Francis, when he's been drinking, drops and kills his new born son. He can't deal with what he's inadvertantly done and leaves thinking if he stayed he'd do more harm to his family and be hated. I'm glad this book was short because I set it down with a heavy heart."
5,Outstanding Language; Brilliant Style; Hard to Forget,"When I bought Ironweed, it was for the mere purpose of contemplating just what it was about the novel that won it the Pulitzer prize. I picked it up late on a Saturday night I read it from cover to cover once I returned home. The language in the novel brilliant and the style is very unique. The characters are also ones that will not perish from the mind like many others that have been created in past [cherished] novels; and make sure you do not touch the movie!Read the book and never watch the movie!Thanks HT"
5,Jason Robards should get an Academy Award,"This is one of the great performances. Robards perfectly presents Kennedy's characters and beautiful prose, alternately blunt and lyrical.This tape is an unforgettable experience."
4,AP English,"Ironweed by WIlliam Kennedy won an abundance of awards and is on the list of the best 100 books ever written. Many are most likely surprised of the excitement over this book because of the difficulty Kennedy had trying to publish it. Kennedy immortalized the life of Albany in the 1930's, bringing unusual attention to all.In the novel it discusses survival on an ordinary man whose bad luck brings him to rock bottom causing him to discover in himself on things he can not understand. During Francis Phelan's life he killed a scab driver with a rock, his infant son by holding him by the diaper and accidentally dropping him, and killing an insane bum for self defense.Throughout the book the people he killed and others are ghost interacting with Francis as in the novel Hamlet.Overall I felt this was a very well written book and would recommend it for reading on the enjoyment level because of Kennedy's use of real life in the Big Apple during the 1930's."
2,more historical document than good movie,great to see the east village from back in the day...but the movie itself is not good.
1,No customer service response from Simplex,"I tried emailing Simplex to order a replacement two or three times without response.That being said, it's a pretty decent kettle. The biggest deficits are:(-) Pouring is not very ergonomic(-) The walls are really thin"
4,Almost perfect,"Almost perfect tea kettle. The spout is long enough so the water doesn't sputter coming out, the handle stays relatively cool, heats quickly. One downside. I always get little black specs coming off the bottom unless I wash the bottom after every few uses. They seem to come from the space between the bottom of the pot and the ribbed area."
1,Leaky Kettle,"Looks great, but...It leaked at the connection of spout to body of kettle. It also had this annoying whistle that rattled around inside. Sometimes it got stuck and didn't rattle around. When that happened, the whistle wouldn't work. It's also awkward to fill. Otherwise, it's a great kettle...for almost $200!Ridiculous."
3,Vexed,"I just got the first run of the 2012 back-in-production simplex kettles, and its quite beautiful out of the box. Honestly, I want to love this kettle but something is not right. My family had the traditional copper simplex kettle as a kid and I immediately sensed this new make (coated with chrome) feels lighter. It also sounds like a toddler learning to whistle, lid tight down, even with a little more heat than you should use according to the directions. I remember the original piping loud and clear, and this is not close. Nothing I see explicitly says it is ""Made in England,"" a selling point, either on the kettle or it's packaging. Given the hassle and wait getting this through Amazon, I'm not sure I dislike it enough to return it, but for the money I am not thrilled. Sorry."
4,Very Possitive Approach,"I'm an ESL teacher. I found it to be a great teaching tool for final year high school students and professional formation courses. Although it was written for American use, that can be worked around to facilitate its use in a more international context. I found it to be a VERY POSSITIVE AND INOVATIVE APPROACH to teaching ESL students how to find a job. Well done!"
4,Good Cd,I did not know this was different than the LP. Just got into Riot in the past year. I'll know to grab the vinyl if I see it anywhere. I liked this.
5,"A superlative ""Discovery""",This book was on my bookshelf for over 30 years before I finally read it. I liked it so much I ordered a couple more copies to loan to friends. It is beautifully written and perfectly describes the hard life and times of the men that pioneered the development of the oil industry in West Texas. It would make a fabulous movie - read it!!
3,Nice tv for the price 3.5 stars,"This TV is good bang for the buck! The average person that buys this TV. Will like it. I am more than average and I like it. Especailly the QAM tunner. I can hook cable direct to unit for digital HD channels a lot of TVs in this price rang don't have that feature. It will make all the differance if you want a digital cable ready tv.If you go to the stores and ask about QAM tunner most people will not even know what you are talking about.regards,Kelvin LyonsInkster, MI"
1,Power Board Went out before we had it 2 years,The cost to replace the board costs almost as much as the tv. I was goign to replace board myself until I called LG and they told me it was $337. Thats crazy. I will NOT buy LG again.
5,Tinker Tinker this is your STAR!,Try to get your hands on the premiere edition. This is a tinkerer's dream come true. I love the MakeShift section. Never knew that aspirin adds life to a dead auto battery. Live and Learn.
5,Left me begging for more!!,"Tremendous read!! Perhaps having background knowledge of Haiti and the revolution was helpful but I found this book immensely enjoyable! Unlike other authors, Professor Bell translates nearly every Kreole quip. The local language creates ambience and authenticity to the book. The characters are very personal and enjoyable developing a believable perspective of the slave uprising from every angle. The violence is not excessive or unnecessary. Haiti continues to be a country of extremes. The people can be incredibly gentle or horrifically cruel! If you don't mind feeling the oppressive humidity or continually swatting the stinging mosquitoes from your neck, this is a must read!! Thank you Professor Bell!!!"
4,gruesomely good,"For any student of slavery or history, this is a great historical work. As a novel, it reads equally well. There is much to learn about not only Haitian but French history from this work. The sequence of events in the back of the book enriches greatly the historical context of the novel itself. I have often read of the relative brutality of Caribbean slavery compared to North American slavery - the events described in this book make the brutality abundantly clear, disturbing and historically consequential.A great book with no simple phiosophisizing or side taking."
2,Didn't grab me,"I started this book ready to be immersed and fascinated. What was it that kept that from happening? No character that really held my interest. Shifting scenes that were hard to hold together. Why didn't I get to know Toussaint, of all people, better through this book? It is indeed an epic, and it does collect evidence for the texture of life of the times. It horrifies, it blasts. But for me, this novel didn't sing"
1,lots of words,"If you like the tease of adultery and fornication, mutiliation from excessive torture in every third chapter then this is the book for you. Bell knows how to stimulate the reader and does so often. The other reviewers have captured his ability to poignantly describe the atmosphere."
5,comprehensible and worthwhile,"I found this an extremely difficult read: I was 16, knew nothing about Haiti's history, and spoke no French. I took nearly three months to finish reading the book, because every so often I had to take a break from the horrific violence Bell portrays. In the end, however, this novel remains one of the most impressive I have ever read, in terms of the way it really made me think. The depths of terror and violence to which Bell's characters resorted shocked me. But I did not lose sight of the novel's bigger picture. Ultimately, I have little sympathy for the book's reviewers who could not see past the novel's violence and complexity. Five tries to get through the book? Try a Dick and Jane reader, then, and come back in a few years."
4,Hardest book I ever read,"And not just because of the frequent French, either. This was a difficult read, containing some of the most shocking descriptions of cruelty I have ever read. That said, it was worth the effort. Madison Smartt Bell's sentences shimmer and his characters come alive. Bell's use of the rebel slave who eventually abandons the rebellion for the bush and the unrepentant plantation owner well make his point that violence, as practiced by white or black, is senseless. So why the preachy epilogue? After suffering, to Bell's credit, through chapter after chapter of human sacrifice and dismemberment, I didn't need to be told that race hate is a bad thing. Still, if you quit before you get to the italicized words, you'll have an important and worthwhile read."
2,BAD DRUM PROGRAMMING,This could have been such a great album but the drum and syth programming leave a lot to be desired and make it sound very dated....had they used live musicians instead it would have been a real classic and the very best way the Esther could have said goodbye by leaving us one last amazing album...but alas was not to be.
3,Decent Book,"Real World Web Services by Will Iverson is more of a ""here's an example of something someone might want to do"" type book. The book contains a lot of Java source code to connect to some web services from big names like eBay, Google, and FedEx. Whether these examples are useful or whether the reader can glean out other uses of the code depends on the skill the reader has in programming. The book also goes over some basic concepts and tools the reader can use to get started with web services. All in all, Real World Web Services will give you a taste of what web services are, yet leaves out the low level details of how it works."
3,"On par, but nothing special... good for testing, though","While the samples are straight-forward, to the point and easy to follow, the book doesn't really provide enough under-the-cover view. Generally speaking, if you are looking for some insight into WS used with Google, eBay, FedEx, etc. this is a wonderful book.If you are looking into information for things such as ""using Axis for real-world WS"", this just scratches the surface.However...This book provided a wonderful set of quick, easy test setups for use against generic WS implementations (such as those provided in B2Bi software) for comparative results. The peer into the provider-specific details made it wonderful to have provide expected output and check the diffs on files.Recommended for QA, unit testing, automated testing, etc.Recommended for those interested in quick samples but not in a core understanding of the technologies."
2,Very specific,I thought that this is a book very specific to certain aspects of web services and examples are overly detailed...I dont expect the book to be compiled mostly with elaborative examples.
2,not what I was hoping for,"I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping for something that would go into detail of the various Web Services solutions offered by Amazon, Google, etc. Instead it is just another Java book filled with mostly code (is it a sin to use prose anymore?) and lacking in any kind of detailed discussion at all. It basically talks about very specific problems, offers some code, then moves on to another specific solution. I found it completely uninteresting.The only person I would suggest this book for is someone who wants code to Cut and Paste without really understanding what they are doing. And good luck to them ;-)"
4,stanton,"this mixer is pretty sweet and i was satisfied with it except i have a ton of drag in the fader already, even though the focus fader is guaranteed to never have drag. I have only had it a few months now."
4,Focus Fader = Crisp Cuts,"The first time you use any of the Stanton mixers equipped with a focus fader, you're going to love how crisp the cuts are. While a normal fader, fades the balance between to channels; the focus fader essentially provides an on-off switch for the channels. This means that any volume fading will have to be done with the individual channel faders, but I do that already. If you get tired of using the focus fader, a standard fader is also included. Using this fader will allow you to adjust the curve of the fading to suit your mixing style. I've been using this almost since it first came out and i'm pretty happy with it. One problem I have with it, is the focus fader is much too easy to accidentally knock around. i suggest trying it at the store to see if its right for you."
2,what the...,"I bought this because I'm a Pearl Jam fan, and there's 3 PJ tracks on the cd. But the rest (11 tracks) is just so terrible is hillarious.Really anoying African music with no instruments.One of the VERY FEW times in my life I've listend to an album once and put it away for good!"
3,not good,"I don't like how this book organizes the nouns into five groups. It's so confusing. My German professor taught me a simpler way of knowing the plural forms of nouns. This book doesn't use the ""du"" or ""ihr"" forms, and it doesn't use the ß.Brandon Simpson"
3,Good Stuff,"This book has helped me understand a lot of the intricacies of the German language. Based on that I would say it is a very worthy purchase for one to have. But, it is not a book written for those who are not fluent on grammatical technical terms. I found myself a little lost at times, when the author would very non-challantly explain that something was just a matter of the ""subjunctive predicative to the second power of the reversed megablaster future tense""...I know, I'm just joking, but I'm sure some of the readers understand what I mean.Having said that, I still say it is a good book for students of German such as myself. You'll just have to dust off your grammar lingo, that's all!"
3,Very Superficial,The verb section of the book does not even mention the Subjunctive Mood. Can you believe that?!?!?!?
5,"Excellent, very helpful, streamlined & compact","Like the other Dover 'Essential ___ Grammar' books, and excellent, surprisingly in-depth grammar. Very helpful if you're suddenly confronted with (re-) learning the language in a hurry (e.g. being assigned to a German-speaking country). The French & Italian versions are just as good. Full of practical information and insights to get you speaking & comprehending the language. No, these do not substitute for a full-blown course of study, but they're the best way to get (re-) started quickly, but with enough info & detail that you'll keep going back to them for years (or as I do, using them to help new learners)."
4,Verry usefull German grammar learning tool,This was a very useful reference tool while learning German. Shipment and delivery was prompt.
5,Small Book Packs a Punch.,"This book is great for quick reference and study. It has all sorts of rules and charts for memorizing German Grammar. Small book, but lots of information.-Dr. Kenneth"
2,Not worth a nickel,"Although the book presents itself as a grammar guide, it actually only contains pages of mostly worthless rules on the gender of nouns. If you want excercises or to actually learn grammar, then don't buy this book. I would recommend ""501 German Verbs""."
3,It was Okay..like a missing link.,The story was dated and lil dry. But the story gives you an idea of the origins of the modern mixed mythology stories.Pilot gets kidnapped to parallel world where evil wizards try to take his body for another evil wizard's soul.
5,A fine study for film buffs and cinema history students.,"British filmmaker Anderson's films were witty social commentaries for the late 20th century, while his documentaries were revealing and educational. Mainly About Lindsay Anderson provides a biographical review of his life and an assessment of his career and achievements, from his early days as a movie-goer to his later influential creations within the industry. Any studying modern film history will find this a fine study."
1,Superficial and dull,"Too much Lambert: i.e., creaky, stilted, and boring.His ""outing"" of the late Nicholas Ray is offensive and exploitive. Moreover, I find it difficult to believe that the explosively talented, sophisticated Ray took Lambert as a lover."
3,product is good but,this product is good but there is no base for the presser you have to hold indvisualey to close the watch back.
2,Perl DBI falls short of what I would expect from O'Reilly,"I liked it after chapter 3...chapters 1 & 2 had SO MUCH to do with DBM (which is NOT DBI) and db_file, that i thought i would scream! Nothing good until page 78...but then, IT IS AWESOME! in depth detail on DBI::Proxy which I have not seen elsewhere...BUT as of page 187, it goes back into ""appendix mode"" which we can get by typing perldoc DBISo--you have to ask yourself, are 109 pages worth the price? I bought it and i really think that even the AMAZON price was a bit steep to pay for this one.ALTHOUGH I love O'Reilly, they needed to get more in-depth for me and considering that we have the Camel, the Perl Cookbook and company...which are EXTREMELY in-depth.This is not a book which i would consider ""O'Reilly Material"""
1,DO NOT BUY,This is just a rewrite of a very badly written DBI docs. This is a very useless book. The supporters and authors of this book are very egotistic and encapsulated in their own world. Perl DBI newsgroup supporters dbi-users@isc.org are even more egotistic. What you get in the man pages is the same as what you get from the book -- a lot of useless documentation.
1,Where is the meat?,"I'm a new perl user, and I found no new information in thisbook. It has the same depth of coverage that can be had for FREE allover the 'Net.Don't buy this book. It's not worth the purchase price!"
1,Terrible Book,"The major stumbling block for this book is that it does not contain worked out examples. Worked out examples are a most. Another problem is not completing started examples. For example, the book talks about SELECT statements and uses a simple SELECT statement such as, SELECT * from TABLE. But then the book gets around to talking about getting the data from a SELECT statement, it switches the SELECT statement to SELECT name, address, number from TABLE. They do not explain how to grab the data from the previous SELECT statment, something that is quite fundamental if you are generating a report. As it stands, it looks like one has to specify every field in the table the SELECT statement is issued against. Which can be quite hefty and something that Java does much better!I will look for a better book and perhaps a better technology, the Perl DBI does not look as robust as JDBC for database programming."
2,Not very accessible as an introduction or a reference.,"This book did not serve me well as an introduction or as a reference. I also did not feel that it had enough detail or ""under the hood"" information to fit in with the ""Programming..."" series of O'Reilly books, nor the organization of such. I still give it two stars, instead of one, only because I do occaisionally open up the book and ""fish"" for an example or solution to a particular problem. It's about as successful as fishing without bait, in most cases."
4,Good book for what it is.,"It's hard to imagine an entire book about this. It's not bad, for what it is though. If you have any database knowledge and read the appropriate sections already in Programming Perl or the Perl Cookbook, I don't imagine you'll get too much use from this."
3,A big disappointment,Don't get me wrong: This is a fine book. It's well-written. It's organized beautifully. The problem is it's just too thin for the price.Roughly one third of the book is given to database theory entirely separate from the DBI. I think it's fair to assume that anyone who's looking into Perl & the DBI is going to be conversant with databases and persistence.
5,A worthy reference and a good read,"I count this book among most used in my personal library. It is clearly written and a solid reference. If you use Perl and you work with databases, you need this book."
1,There's virtually nothing in this book,"This book is slim. About 1/3 is a DBI reference, which you can get free from the distribution. About 1/5 of the book (in the beginning), it describes Berkeley's dbm (and thus why DBI is necessary). So, what we have left is mere 130 pages to describe DBI features. The author uses these pages to explain only very simple things like: How to connect to the database, and execut very simple queries like ""SELECT name FROM employee"", get the result set, and so forth. The book never describes more complex real world problems, such as how you would execute stored procedures (for example, in Oracle, PL/SQL packages) get the result back through arguments, and other intricate problems. If you want to learn the very fundamentals of how to connect, execute, and get the results for very simple SQL queries, this book will help you. But then you can visit free web sites that offer such things. If you want to solve real world problems using DBI, this book offers NOTHING !"
4,"pretty good book, but so is the CPAN documentation","This is a (the definitive) book on Perl DBI. I swapped book-for-book with a former co-worker for this. I keep it in the office for the newbies.If you're already a pro at PERL, you should be able to get by with just the CPAN documentation. However, if your employer is footing the bill, get it. :-)However if you're new to PERL and need to use DBI, get it.Very nice tips and tricks you can pick up, even a few for the pros."
2,THIS BOOK IS USELESS!,"I typically go to O'Reilly for manuals FIRST because they are well-written and contain coherent explanations and good examples which the reader can use as models.This book has neither. The examples are insanely limited (for example, there is nothing whatsoever about using UPDATE: the authors apparently believe that all databases on the planet are complete and that no one will ever want to change any of them), and one find oneself hopping around the book trying to get SOME indication of how things are supposed to work - therefore its usefulness as a reference book is also limited.In short, wait until something else comes along and until then either read the documentation that comes with the DBI module or the source code itself. You'll save yourself more time that way."
2,Try `man DBI`,"The only thing I learned from this book is what region in the UK where some popular megalyths are and how I should act while visiting them. (Which I why it got a 2 in stead of a 1)Unless you want to learn more about megalyths, try `man DBI`"
4,It's a good book!,"It isn't excellent book and is an old text, but there aren't many texts about this subject and this book fill these space."
2,bellybomb,This product was not what I was really looking for. Tt did what they said it would do so no complaint there.
3,Subwoofer on surround sound mode,"I'm not sure if this is supposed to happen, but the subwoofer does not kick in during surround sound mode (standard), but if someone has this stereo and it does tell me :P. Anyways, this was disapointing because because without any base with surround sound, the experience is really not that good."
1,Highway robbery,This book is available for much less on the internet. I hate it when people get ripped off.you can find this book for about $30-$40 on the internet. Use google.I have the original version of this book. It is a good book. Simple everyday Trinidad cooking.This book was originally published as a fund raiser for the school . I would try and google the school and buy it directly from them. At least then your money is going to help the school.For those of you who think the price shown on Amazon is in TT dollars -- try buying it from Amazon and see how you get charged in American dollars.
4,better than expected,"This cabinet is really all real wood and it looks great. It is slightly hard to assemble compared with an IKEA type of package. But not too bad. The shoe spaces are small but I took out some of the dividers so regular shoes could fit and it is working great for me. The doors are not perfectly square in the unit but no one notices. Overall I love it and everyone who comes in comments on how nice it looks. And because my three kids have to take off their shoes in the house, it helps so much with shoe storage. I don't think I got 60 pairs in there but it does fit a lot of shoes. For the price it is a great buy."
4,Better than sliced bread!,"I really love this shoe cabinet. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because depending on the types of shoes you are storing, you will most likely not get 60 pairs in it. I removed two of the vertical dividers to allow larger slots for high heeled shoes and boot shoes. The smaller slots will comfortably hold low to no heeled sandals and flip flops. I wear a womens size 7 1/2 and have to put the heeled shoes in the larger slots.It really is real wood, minus the backboard. It looks beautiful and protects your shoes at the same time! I have the dark oak. It does take quite a bit of time to put together, but was well worth it. It's the best shoe storage I've ever owned. Would really love to eventually get another one.Note that it does ship in two separate boxes. At first I thought I was missing the doors, but they arrived a couple of days later in a separate box."
3,Quality could be better,"Apparrently all NFL mini helmets are Riddell brand. The quality and detail of this helmet are not as good as my Schutt brand colleigate helmet. There is a raised ridge down the center line of the helmet where the two halves are joined together. The interior padding, facemask, and chinstrap are not as detailed as the Schutt."
4,Great replica helmet,Simple but well constructed...great for getting autographed. Looks very realistic and makes a great gift. Colors are bright and true to the dolphins colors...Vibrant and durable....great for collectors...
1,Worst thing I've ever heard,"This is the worst thing ever created, it must have been released by deaf guys. Jerry would roll over in his grave."
1,"Shallow, bland and unscholarly","Why do people write books when they have nothing profound or original to say, and nothing in the way of serious scholarship to share? This book's content even falls short of effective popularization. Sadly, ""works"" like this reinforce the case for relaxing academic pressure to publish."
1,Dont waste your money!!!!,"Broken Hope......the name fits the band......This band has NO HOPE of producing a death metal CD with listenable quality. This is by far the worst death metal CD I have ever listened to. Though Joe's vocals are gutteral and brutal, you cant even piece together what he is grunting with the music in the background....you sit there.....scratch your head......and think ""What the hell is going on here?"" EVERY song in my opinion sounds the same....they could have just done one song and re-recorded it for the rest of the CD. I made the mistake of buying this piece of crap....do not make the same. If you want some horrific, gut wrenching death metal, get Cannibal Corpse ""Tomb of the Mutilated""!"
5,Avian Osteology,"This second edition is becoming increasingly harder to find, but is an essential book for any archeologist, paleontologist, biologist, ornithologist, many other ""gist's"", or just an amateur interested in the subject. It provides excellent plates on bird bone morphology and the taxon character keys are extremely useful. A solid buy!"
5,An Indispensable Book,"This is an indispensable book for anyone interested in this subject. For all of us who think of the holocaust as a fast, furious and random event, Zucotti corrects us in showing a no less devilish but organized, punctilious horror. I am truly in awe of my grandparents, people who always respected the law and wouldn't think of not responding to a summonce, for having the wits and the luck to escape anihilation in occupied france."
3,Catholic problem,"This is for Ellen, the last person to post a comment. I would recommend the film ""the shame and the sorrow,"" a great documentary chronicling French participation in the Holocaust. Unfortunately, the French Catholic church not only was complacent when French Jews were being rounded up, many among them actively encouraged it. Some started sermons with the ""Heil Hitler"" salute. The author did not create the Catholic problem, the Catholic church did. The Church's history of perpetuating the deicide myth, blood libel and its insistence that Jews deserved eternal condemnation and punishment throughout history, played directly into Nazi ideology. Denying history will not improve the Catholic Church's image; active denunciation of past hateful preaching will!"
2,A Catholic Problem?,"This book is a balanced study of the French efforts to save Jews during the Shoah, but it seems to have a Catholic problem. One of the strongest groups defending the Jews and hiding Jews was the French Catholic conference of bishops. The author seems to have a problem admitting this. She blithely ignores the pastoral letters denouncing racism and anti-Semitism. She also ignores the turning point in the relationship between the Vichy regime and the bishops. It was precisely the anti-Semitic laws of 1942 which moved the bulk of French bishops from cautious support of the Vichy regime to clear opposition to a racist government which they found appalling. The author's Catholic problem mars all of her work in this area."
3,CIPA 70600 Replacement Mirrors - Drilling Required,"I received the mirrors and followed the instructions and installed the right side mirror with no problem at all. The studs on the mirror lined up with the holes in the door of the truck and I had it installed and ready to go in about 10 minutes. When I went to install the driver's side the studs did not line up with the holes in the door and one of the bottom studs (lower left) was about 1/4 inch off. The stud was evidently installed in the wrong hole (there were 2 next to each other)and since they are pressed in, they could not be removed. I had to either uninstall the right side and send the pair back or drill a hole in the door to make it line up and I chose drilling the hole. Other than that the mirrors appear to be well made and much larger than I expected (a plus), there should have been a better QC check."
4,Nice mirrors!,"These tow mirrors are great! I bought them for my 2002 GMC Sierra Crew Cab 4x4 truck. Installation was a breeze and they work well and look nice. I was worried about excessive vibration on a mirror this large, but the vibration level is acceptable. These make towing much more enjoyable. Also included in the box were a set of spot mirrors. These mirrors look great on the truck."
4,For true Death Metal fans only,"Pivitol release partly marking the beginning of Death Metal as a genre. Unsurpassed brutality, speed and aggression."
4,"Brilliant original, awesome covers","Hammer Smashed Face. Is there really anything else to say? An incredible, unrelenting death metal classic that shines on all fronts, and doesn't rely on the crutch of necrophilia that so many of their songs, especially on Tomb of the Mutilated, have leaned on. C Corpse's cover of Possessed's the Exorcist is well executed, tight, and heavy, and their version of the Black Sabbath classic Zero the Hero is even heavier with Chris Barnes' ultra heavy, completely un-understandable singing and the guitar mastery of Jack Owen. Worth the money, if you want to own a classic song, but don't want to pay $15 for a whole bunch of necrophilia crap."
1,The insanity of it all....,"CC is in heaven. They are such talentless ""musicians"", that it's enough for them to generate some controversy about their sick lyrics and sick drawings.THis CD is horrible, as everything this band does."
1,Posers( AKA the Green Day of the Death Metal World),"Please, CC is everything that is wrong with death metal. It has become a cliche. Poor songwriting, bad musicianship and production.If you want good death metal might I suggest Obituary, Carcass, early Sepultura, even Napalm Death is better then this garbage."
1,Ladies and Gentlemen: MUSIC DOESN'T GET WORSE THAN THIS!!!!,"First of all, this is not even music PERIOD, this is a ludicrous bedlam of senseless, vile, indiscernible, untalented racket that anybody could do by getting as much noise as possible together and adding in growling vocals that sounds not much different from a demon barfing with razors in its throat (even worse than Gollum's episodes).Cannibal Corpse is the vilest, most hideous, gruesome (everything disgusting you can think about) and in simple terms---downright gross. Anybody that recommends this has SERIOUS problems on all echelons of sanity. Nobody in their right mind would write a review so ironic as the one entitled on this page ""words don't do justice"". In fact, it's the most ironic piece of literature I've ever seen in my life because it describes the exact OPPOSITE of what this song and band have produced her.This has another name ""the music from hell"". It's not even worth checking out."
5,"Cannibal Corpse, 'nuff said.","I bought this cd to introduce me to the death metal scene. I felt it to be well worth the cash. I have not heard the Tomb of the Mutilated LP yet, but I am aware of the necrophelia lyrics. Hammer Smashed Face is an excellent song, and if you aren'tcomfortable with the necro, then buy this classic track."
4,A classic song from death metal legends Cannibal Corpse,"Some people may not want to waste their money on this, because is only a mere 15 minutes of music, but does offer some good songs. ""Hammer Smashed Face"" is just a great song and fan favorite enough said. Next you've got a cover of the song ""The Exorcist"" which is an okay cover. The last song is very cool. It's a cover of Black Sabbath's ""Zero The Hero"". Hammer Smashed Face is just a fun cd single with the beloved song ""Hammer Smashed Face"" and some unreleased covers which can only be found on this cd single."
1,Awful!,"Wow, these guys need to wake up and figure out how untalented they are. Oooh Necrophelia, how creative! It's never been done before. These guys only needed one album, since all the songs sound the same. The sad thing is that people listen to this VOLUNTARILY! Man, these guys sure do suck!"
3,Hey there sports fan!,"Joe Garagiola was a journeyman catcher in Major League Baseball from 1946 to 1954. He later gained even more fame from his TV appearances as a baseball commentator and game show panelist. He was even the guest host of The Tonight Show the night that John Lennon and Paul McCartney dropped by. This book was originally published in 1960. It is not an autobiography, it's a look at what goes on behind the scenes in baseball. This being 46 years later, the information is dated, but it's still an interesting look at what baseball was like in the ""good old days"". I first read this book when I was a boy, and re-reading it now 25 years later, it doesn't seem quite as funny to me. Still pretty interesting, but not ""laugh out loud"" funny."
3,Bags are OK,"I've bought these bags before; the first four boxes I had were great, but this last batch is a little flimsier for some reason, so I'm not completely satisfied. However, I wouldn't have any other litter box than Clevercat. My cat loved it from day one and since she really likes to scratch around alot, it has saved me lots of clean up."
3,wish these were bigger,"I love the Clevercat system, and so does my kitty. But, the liners are much too short! I wish they were longer and able to drape more over the sides - when you fill with litter (I use Feline Pine), you have to stretch the liner so you can put the cover on top. My husband tapes the liner to the box so it doesn't fall. We've tried garbage bags in a pinch, and they're ok, but sometimes have odor shields and stuff I don't want my cat around.These rip fairly easily - my boy looooves to bury his deposits, and he frequently shreds the liners. Would love to see something stronger and less expensive!"
1,not needed,"tears after a few times, even when I'm trying to be careful. The Clevercat Top Entry box is great, but because the sides are rounded not squared, the scooper has a tendency to rip the liner. (I don't think that would happen if the box were not curved).If you really prefer using a liner, then you'll need to find a special scooper designed for use with liners. Using your normal scooper will not work well."
2,Does not fit.,They are too short and very flimsy....i have to use standard trash bags for my top loading litter box. I used to be able to buy the liners at Petsmart that worked but they do not carry them anymore either.
2,Would be better if they fit the box......,"I bought two Clever Cat litter boxes, that came with sample liners. I placed on order for a pack of replacement liners in my cart - when I went to place the order, I found that the price had gone up in a couple of months. That's a good thing because:The Clever Cat bags don't fit the Clever Cat boxes very well: as another reviewer noted, they don't fit down into the corners - and they aren't deep enough to fit securely over the rim to be held down by the lid. I'm on my fourth liner/try: the cats don't scratch through the liner, they just pull it down, bury it in the litter and pee on it. Yuck!I found that a drawstring, flexible strength garbage bag from the supermarket fits over the top, into the bottom. It stays tidy and is much much cheaper!"
3,Black plastic garbage bags are cheaper and stronger.,"This is a review for the Clevercat Top Entry Litter Box Liners - not the litter box. I like the box, but the liners are nothing special. I bought these thinking I needed them because they are specially sized. Unfortunately they don't stand up to extensive scratching and are easily torn.I was pre-lining the litter box with heavy duty garbage bags because these liners were always shredded when it came time to change out the box. Now I just double line with heavy duty garbage bags and skip the Clevercat liners all together. I have found this to not only be less expensive, but also more effective as the cats don't always completely shred the first layer of bag anymore since the garbage bags I am using are much stronger.Get the box, don't buy the bags. You don't need them."
3,Clever Cat User,My male cats looove this box-like litter box. The Clever Cat litter liners are another story. They should be made of thicker plastic like the Jonny Cat liners. Also they should be cut to be boxier so that all four corners match the four corners of the box. This will make so much easier to pour the litter and I'm sure it would be more comfortable for the cats.
2,Overpriced Bags,I purchased the top entry litter box to cut down on litter being kicked out on the floor but am disappointed with the fit of these liners and the cost. They sag and come loose when litter is added. I feel stuck using these overpriced bags since they are the only option for the top entry litter box. How can they justify charging so much for a plastic bag.
3,"If your cats like to claw, do not buy","Although these litter liners are thicker than others we've used, they don't hold up to one of our cat's incessant post-litter box deposit scratching (although I'm not sure even teflon would hold up to it). They're decent but pretty much a waste if they're ridden with holes. If you can get these for a good deal, I'd say go ahead and buy them (it will save at least a little bit of cleanup)."
3,"Great idea, but overpriced","If you have a cat that likes to scratch at her litter a lot, and tends to spread it outside of the litter box, then this is a great solution. But the product is exactly what it appears: a plastic storage bin with a hole cut in the lid. You can easily make one yourself for much, much cheaper. If I had not been working overseas at the time of my purchase, trying to help my wife out back home when she was complaining about the bathroom habits of our cat, I would have made one myself. So I will consider the premium I paid as a gratuity for the inventor, because I am not sure I would have thought of this on my own."
1,"Quality used to be good, but now its horrible",Clevercat must have changed their manufacturing process of bags - they used to be very durable and fit the box well. But now the bags are much thinner (cats scratch through easily) and the bag doesn't even fit in the box. I bought a bunch on sale a while back and I regret the purchase. I'll use the other suggestions here to use regular garbage bags.Sad the manufacturer let this happen.
1,2-3 inches too small!,"Others have said it well: but the box, find other liners. These are a couple of inches shorter than they need to be to extend over the lip enough to stay put. And, they're not particularly strong. My cat shreds them or pulls them down to cover her ""deposit"" ... the later leaves a fresh deposit on top of the liner. Clevercat can do better!"
1,Doesn't fit the box!!!,"I just bought the litter box but haven't let my cat try it out yet, as liner doesn't fit! The Clevercat litter box itself seems great--with a male cat who doesn't care where he goes, the high walls and top entrance are a great idea.Why doesn't the liner itself fit the box?!? Really? What was the company who makes this product thinkin? ""Why even use a liner at this rate?"" Gee, thanks, you come clean my cat's box!Grr!I'll be trying what others suggested -- using garbage can liners."
5,An Extremely Readable Book Full of Important Information,"This book was obviously written after much research into the Hepatitis C virus and made to be very readable for the average person. After reading it, I was amazed at how much I learned about this dreadful disease which afflicts so many Americans, and will continue to afflict many more in the future. There are few books available on this topic at any bookstore, so it was a pleasure to find one so easy to understand, but that was also highly endorsed by one of the top physicians in this field.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has the virus, or to anyone who knows someone afflicted with Hepatitis C. Well worth the money."
4,No Clouds,"On ""Favourite Colours"" this Toronto-based band turns in a good set. ""Song of the Chief Musician (Part 2)"" sounds like mid-flight Byrds with the Sadies climaxing in a thunderous guitar storm. ""Why Be So Curious (Part 3)"" plays at a midtempo pace with jangling guitars and then stops abruptly like a car right before the cliff. Blue Rodeo's Greg Keelor chimes in with backing vocals on ""A Good Flying Day,"" ""The sun is up, there's no clouds in your way."" Of the instrumentals, ""A Burning Snowman"" stands out with a stately guitar twang that'd make Duane Eddy blush. This set by the Sadies is a good strong outing with sparkling moments, both vocally and instrumentally. Enjoy!"
3,eagles,good product but on the small side for the price...other then that aceptable...And also will like to buy all of them..
3,Decals,"I've never purchased a mini football helmet before, but I thought that the helmet decals would've been painted on (it's a sticker). The sticker is quite thick so the clear outlines of the sticker is quite pronounced. Perhaps my expectations were on the high side?"
5,GREAT MUSTANG Book!,Book was very informative. Pictures are great!!! My husband was very pleased and he's a Mustang pro and fan!!!
5,Everything Changes,"Laurie Anderson: Live in New York is an eerie CD that reflects the feeling of being present in a time of uncertainty. Laurie's music, which has always been ahead of its time, seems perfectly fitted for the Town Hall performance shortly after September 11th. Listening to ""Statue of Liberty"" from her last CD and that freedom is, ""So precious, so easy to loose"" to hearing ""Let X=X"" written almost 20 years before speaking that ""I gotta' go"" from a burning building, she brings you into thinking about the hear and now. Laurie chose to perform some of her best pieces (O Superman, Life on a String, White Lily, Coolsville, etc.) from her extensive body of work and ties them together skillfully. All of Laurie Anderson's musical stories/songs of life, death, technology, futility, time, loss and angels surround you. You are left feeling moved, touched by life around you and aware that as everything changes, history is happening right before your eyes."
1,Deflated the first time used,"I looked at all the similar items and bought this one based on price and good customer reviews. Unfortunately, we pumped it up, set up 2 boys under 5 to sleep on it (inside a house, by the way), and it was nearly deflated by morning. Same the next night. We checked every possible source for a leak and did not locate it. I do not recommend."
1,poor quality,"The mattress stayed full through the night for only the first 4 uses. Somehow lost its seal and now leaks air. I've checked the entire thing thoroughly for leaks but can't find any. The mattress was used properly and the manufacturer's recommendations were followed, so it should NOT be leaking. Poor quality."
1,Only if you want to wake up on the floor,Bought one. Lasted less than three months. Thought maybe it was just a dud so got another. Burned again. As Roger Daltrey once again...won't get fooled again
1,Poor quality junk from China. Buy something else.,"This would be a great product if it didn't leak and fall apart.I bought the queen size mattress for use in the guest room. It's comfortable (until the air leaks out) and the velour covering does a good job of keeping a mattress pad, or blankets from sliding around. The battery powered air pump is a nice touch as well, that inflates the bed in just a few minutes. Beyond that, what a waste of money.The bed had a leak we couldn't find, so every 2-3 days it had to be re-inflated. I was very careful about not over inflating per the manufacturer's instructions. After several days, the seams holding the top and bottom layers together started coming apart. The result was a huge and ever-growing bubble in the middle of the bed.Despite having the cross logo and SwissGear name on the box, this product is made in China. I would suggest doing some research and spending a little extra money on something better."
1,Terrible design of valve,The valve is a faulty design and started leaking after 4 nights. In a home on carpeted floor. One small person sleeping on it. I checked for punctures. There were none. The valve still leaked after trying several adjustments. If you buy this you will wake up on the floor several times a night. Very poor quality for the money. Pump is noisy but worked fine.
2,Not comfort air bed- Its uncomfortable,"I didn't like sleep on it. I can never inflate it till its hard, some air is bound to escape when you try to seal the cap after pumping it. The seal could have been much smaller then it would take forever to fill it, then they could have provided a better pump....it goes on. For this price, I answered myself, this is what we get :) The pump is run on batteries and not any AC power supply. It takes a while to completely deflate it and roll it back. Now I have a leak/punch on it and I just threw it away in garage."
5,Pure Metal. Unrefined and Evil!,"This record is timeless. This is a turning point in what was concidered ""heavy"" metal. When Slayer came to the scene, they left other bands in the dust. More evil than Iron Maiden. Better and faster than even Metallica. Seriously this album is insanely fast! Maybe not in the same way as Reign In Blood, but for 1983 this the speed of the riffing and drumming is unbelievable. Slayer became a household name for themselves in metal....Hell Awaits, Seasons In The Abyss, God Hates Us All...all Slayer records are great in their own way but this one takes the cake as far as content and overall classic value. No need for a track run because its all good through and through. If you can find it, get the restless records version of Show No Mercy w/ the Haunting The Chapel e.p. on it! 13 classic Slayer cuts. If you listen to heavy metal you must get this and Bloodbath's Nightmare's Made Flesh. Stay sick."
5,Slayer- Show No Mercy,"Fast lyrics, fast instruments and an overall evil presence that defines the very word, 'SLAYER'. Tom Araya's 'theatrical' vocal style is reminiscent of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. Although it sounds as if Tom plays catch up with the rapid guitar leads, he plays it off with a long range of 'war cry falsettos' and an enduring, almost storytelling vocal style. Before a time of computer-accurate instrumentals, bands like Slayer were incorporating raw talent, in this case Hanneman and King's guitars, into their sound; a sound of rebellious Rock n Roll and evil thinking.If you are inexperienced with Slayer, I'd recommend you start with 'Show No Mercy' to understand and learn the beginning stages of what they would become which is, undoubtedly, Heavy Metal Icons."
4,No Mercy Shown,"Although Slayer would later transcend the boundaries of typical metal and become the epitomization of speed metal, they received their start as a blazingly raw thrash band. Similar in sound to Judas Priest and similar in pure energy to Metallica(Kill 'em All), Show no Mercy exhibits a sound that would never be heard again by Slayer or by any other thrash band of the decade. The lead work is brilliant, the vocals are dynamic, and the lyrics are a prime example of the band's Satanesque gimmick. I wish that the rating system would allow for a 4.5 star rating, because that is what I would officially give this album. Songs like ""Die by the Sword"" and ""Crionics"" are powerful while ""The Antichrist"" and ""The Final Command"" are blazing fast. The album is well rounded and welldone. It can't be recommended for everyone; opinions are relative, but any fan of Slayer or thrash metal in general will find this one to be worth hours of listening."
5,one of slayers best,"this is one of slayers better albums, i didnt particularly like SEASONS IN THE ABYSS because of Tom's mediocre vocals, though most of the songs would have been really good had he sounded more like he did on REIGN IN BLOOD. anyway, this cd sounds almost exactly like Metallica's debut KILL EM ALL. its got some good riffs, pretty good vocals and driving drum beats. Tom doesnt sound quite as death metal-ish on this, and the vocal production sounds kind of weird, but overall a great debut from Slayer"
3,Hasn't aged well,"I know I'll dissonate to the majority of reviewers here.Yes, this is one of the 1st documented thrash-metal founding records. Yes, when I first heard it back in 1989, I was immensely impressed. Yes this is the raw sound, unique in a way.But as time flew by, now, 20 years since its release, initial impression has faded away, and in my eyes it's not as interesting as it seemed then. Main reasons for this fact are (1) All band members do not sound very proffessional here yet, and would dramatically improve their performance even the following year, (2) this was just a template for brutal satanic thrash, that would later be developed into full glory in more deserving records, and (3) most of the songs here have countless live versions which are by far better than here in the studio.Thus, recognizing the importance of this album, I give it only 3 stars. The real Slayer started the next year, with ""Haunting the Chapel"" EP."
5,Slayer's First and Best,"1983 saw the release of ""Kill 'em All"", Megadeath's ""Killing is My Business"", and of course, ""Show No Mercy"". And the speed metal genre was born. Many will say that ""Reign in Blood"" is Slayer's best, but I disagree. It's good, but Show No Mercy offers more musical diversity. It's intense, fast, and the lyrics are not for the faint-hearted. Dark, demented, and devilsh, ""Die By the Sword"", ""The Anti-Christ"", and ""Tormentor"" are not only three of Slayer's best songs, but may be three of the top all-time speed metal songs. Any music fan who thinks posers like Napalm Death and Morbid Angel are true thrash/death metal, haven't heard ""Black Magic"" or ""Die By the Sword"". This album is a must for any speed metal fan."
5,Metal at its best,"This is slayers best work as far as im concerned it thrashes from beginning to end, If you want to find out what your stereo is made of put this in and crank it up!"
1,its not their fault....,"that they sucked back then, it was their first cd, so i see why...get diabolus in musica,its way better, slayer rocks, killswitch are the gods of metal. peace...."
2,not good debut....,"the drum sounds is so thin , cant compare it to metallica or megadeth debut album which are much betterits not really brutal either compare to their later releasemetal storm is best track on my opinionthis is shoulb be 3 or 4 star if better production"
2,Not as good as everyone says it is. Slayer got much better,"2.5 stars. There are a few classic songs on this album, such as ""The Antichrist"" and ""Black Magic"", but this is only the begining of how great Slayer were about to become. The guitarwork isn't that great, and the lyrics are much more tough to take seriously, both of which were completely changed on their later albums. Diehard fans will enjoy this, but you'd be much better off buying ""Reign In Blood"", ""South of Heaven"", or ""Seasons In the Abyss"", three of metal's finest documents. That's when Slayer went from being just another average thrash band to a truly monumental experiance."
5,slayer,"the greatest debut by any band the band that set the the speed metal thrash movement many bands have tried but none could followwhen i first heard this in my room back in 1983 i was just getting over the release of metallica's kill em all which was still raging in my ears over the summer.when i first read about the band slayer i coukd not wait for there debut i first heard them on metal massacre put out by metal blade records i got thelp the day it came out rushed home put it on the turn table andjust sat there as it played unable to move unable to blink or breath the songs flowed out evil has no boundries,the antichrist,die by the sword it just keep coming at me like a speed metal train i was just in awe.at the time 1983 there was nothing like this out so evil so fast so heavy ...yes this is slayer the new metal gods the evil ones there debut nothing would ever come close to this what astart of a great metal band"
4,Excellant Debut,"Show No Mercy, Slayer's debut effort, is a great album. While they would make better ones, this still stands as one of the best debuts ever. The only complaints I have are with the lacking production and sloppiness of some of the guitars.This album features some geniune classics, like The Antichrist and Die By the Sword. What I don't get is why no seems to comment on Tormentor or The Final Command, which are two of my favorite Slayer songs.Slayer would go on too make faster and more complex music, but don't think this is bad because it isn't as fast or complex as those other albums. It is excellant, and a nice album for those wanting to get into the band to start out with."
5,"Slayer's earth-shattering debut, a head bangin' classic","Slayer is one of the greatest bands metal has ever seen. Their debut is filled with the aggression and thrash that Slayer is well known for. Kerry and Jeff's solo's are fast, furious, and well executed; some of the best Slayer solos i have ever heard are on this album. This is, in my opinion, one of the darkest thrash albums ever made. About as heavy as heavy metal was back in 1983."
4,Amazin price quality product,"I've got 2 of those STR8-30 theyre simply g8 for their catogery and price !very nice turntable nice features ! Yet it ain't the best for scratchin but its very competitive ! strong needle very resistent !!what can I say it is a dream ! you want a very good quality product , dont wanna pay too much !Well you got it !!! worth buying ! almost as good/performent to a Technics turntable of the same category !you find better @ that price ! go for it !!Dj T from Paris !"
1,Wrong item never received credit back for purchase,"Even though it states and takes you through ""find out of this item fits your vehicle"" it did not fit not only that the credit back for the item was never returned to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The decline of western civilization,"I cannot believe that the American public is allowing themselves to be tricked into liking this stupid, lowest-common-denominator, unimaginitive nonsense. The beat is flat, the lyrics are incredibly stupid, and the entire song is fake, ""I'm so strong I'm going to leave you even though I've hung around and allowed you to treat me like garbage for years"" sloganeering. Do your soul a favor and buy any other record out there besides this. Encouraging the record industry to produce more crap like this can only make us a weaker nation."
5,Olivia's Hitting Hard!,"I Love this song. The music and lyrics are tight. She's upset and she doesn't mind letting you know. I can't wait for the album to come out. This song reminds me a bit of Kelis' song ""Caught Out There"". I like songs that express anger. There are so many that express sadness, but anger is a powerful emotion too. I hope Olivia continues to give us more. Her style is incredible!"
4,Fun Fun Fun!,"All I have to say is that Olivia is a trend setter and now peeps all over are gonna be saying ""I'm About To BIZOUNCE"". Another comment on her, she is always making a mean face on all of her pictures, I mean she could sing songs that are sad and about unhappiness as smile, look at Destiny's Child. Regardless of all the not so neccessary swear words this track is pretty good. This Single even has a (Pg-13) version and a few snippets from her upcoming album. I'm sure Olivia is gonna be remembered for this song, I hear it more and more everyday. You better go buy this single before I be about to ""Bizounce""!!!"
5,NOEL,"NOEL, a little golden book is one of the best gifts a person can have or give to one that loves the true meaning of Chirstmas."
2,Not that great,The book tries to make parallels between the rise of communism in the USA in this other reality and the rise of communism in the USSR and barely pulls it off. Then it tries to follow how the lives of certain Americans would have turned out diffently in the USSA and does it most uncovincingly. Finally it just seems to give up and tries to be cutesy after a while. I wanted to like this book but it just never got off the ground for me.
5,Quality sheets--great price!,"I have purchased several sets of sheets through various online specials. These are by far the best quality for the price that I've received so far. They don't ""pill up,"" and just get softer with every wash. I would buy more if I needed them."
1,so thin you can see through them,This set only made it through one washing before it started coming apart. My dog jumped up on the bed & her nails cut thru the sheets. That is a first time that has happened to me - even with sheets with much fewer thread count. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of these sheets - don't waste your money on them!
1,THE WORST SHEETS IVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purchased these sheets after i read all the excellent reviews here. Evidently Amazon must do alot of editing because the experience i had with these sheets was a total opposite. When i first received these sheets i was totally disappointed. They were very thin and rough. I contacted Amazon for a refund. They told me they would send me a return shipping label. After two weeks i didnt hear anything back from them. I needed some sheets bad so i decided to wash them to see if they would soften up. WWRROONNGGG!!!!! They now feal like a newspaper that has been washed then dryed. These sheets are so stiff the wrinkles are actually painful. U can actually hear these sheets crackle. Even the convicts in Americas prison sleep on better linens. I wouldnt take these sheets even if they were FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'LL really be surprised if i see this review in print.
1,Damaged Product,"The sheet set was nice, but damaged. There was a long cut line going down into several layers of the folded sheets. It appears the product was damage by a box cutter when it was removed from its original case.The product was retuned and after a follow up phone call, a full refund was received including shipping cost."
4,for a specific audience only,"this book isn't suitable for inexperienced DBAs, but a DBA moving from Solaris to NT will find the differences between the two platforms apparent enough that a reference like this is very useful."
1,A big waste of time,This book offers no new or usefull information for anyone who has more than a rudimentary knowlege of Oracle. The sections on NT are essentially a rehash of Oracle Support bullettins.
1,lack of direction,I am very surprised that Oracle press has come out with a book like this where there is no sense of focus or direction. It just throws in some Windows NT stuff without explaining when or why to use them.
2,Presentation level is not deep enough,"The authors are trying to touch every tool of the oracle8 just on the outset. It lacks detail presentation to understand the fine level use of the tools. Hence, the book is like a overview. It's not really worth for the money. However, the overview is useful to know what tools are in ORACLE8."
5,a must on Russian icons,"Ouspensky"" book is a must for anyone trying to learn about the development of Orthodox iconography in Russia."
2,OK NO by OK GO,There are only a few good songs and the rest to me is just rock filler. Nothing really different or new. The two songs A Million Ways and Here It Goes Again are the most unique songs on the CD. This CD does not have the video's which I was really dissapointed with.
1,not good at all,"Don't waste your money on this cd. The only good song is #7. The rest of the songs are boring, predictable, and annoying to listen to."
4,Ok Go Listen To Oh No,"The title of my review says it all!Songs like ""Invincible"",""Do What You Want"",""A Good Idea At The Time"",And ""Its A Disaster"" make this better than their first effort.Poppy,Yes!Catchy,Yes!Fun,Yes!What more could you want?"
5,Ok Go Oh No So Good,"Excellent music and the best music video ever, even better than Spike Lee's Fat Boy Slim video."
5,Amazing cd!,"What can I say about Ok Go? There is no other band like them. You either love them or you hate them, and I love them. They don't really fit into one genre of music, it's more of a mix of a ton of stuff.Each song sounds different but they are all amazingly catchy. Anyone who doesn't own this album must be crazy. They make you want to jump up and dance, and that's exactly what I do every time I listen to this album.(this is thesongbegins over at the juggling club!)"
5,AWESOMENESS,I love their songs.They got a really good way of making them..And i must say the video to A Million Ways made me sorta laugh but it was a good video..All their songs have been great and their getting better and better just like any other band..But i must say i give this five stars its a great cd anyone who hasnt got it should get it and check it out.
5,stoopidgracie loves OK Go,"When I first heard OK Go, I didn't think that they could outdo even themselves. I was proven wrong when this album came out. Immediately I was tapping my feet to their lyrical beats and dancing to the swankness of their music. This album is very ""feel good"" and is one of my personal favorites."
5,More than just the treadmill song,This album contains more than just the treadmill song. It's full of rock-awesome with a bunch of catchy songs you didn't know existed until you hear them. It's a pleasantly surprising album loaded with their funky fun sound that makes you wanna dance.
5,buy the limited edition,"Wanna feel like you're 14 and just went to your first stadium concert? Wanna feel like you're 21 and can finally get into 1st Ave to see all of your buddies rock, be silly and not take yourself too seriously?YOu can do all of that and not give up your nearly-40-year-old brain! This band is entertaining from every angle. There is not a bad song in either release.get it get it get it.you will not be disappointed. I thought the Great American Rock band was disappearing - OH NO.The limited ed has the videos we've all seen plus some hilarious extra song/videos.The only problem is that your 4 and 6 year-olds might get tired of you rocking out when they'd rather listen to bluegrass or opera!!!??? Further proof of alien invasion."
5,Favorite album ever,"I love this album so much! it is seriuosly one of the best compilations of good music ever created, and it was recorded in Sweden, no less, which only doubles the excitement. the songs all seem to blend together, instead of the choppy slow-song to quick-song cd's you're used to, it's really nice. I have started measuring time in Oh No, for instance, ""My homework took me four Oh No's and an It's a Disaster last night."" or ""It took two Oh no's and a Let It Rain to get to my Grandmother's house going over the river and through the woods."""
4,digesting okgo,"presently i am digesting okgo.verdict: their second cd isn't half bad. it rocks harder than say fountains of wayne but is in a similar vein. probably two good and two very good numbers on the thing. a definite must listen on rhapsody (har har).no synths or strings on this recording. i like that. a rock band still needs to show its chops as a four piece combo playing straight ahead 4/4 rock. some tongue in cheek lyrics help this recording out and don't seem too cute.""when they finally come to destroy the earth...they'll have to go through you first..."" line in ""invincible"" is both funny and thought provoking. proving once again that getting dumped can still provide interesting grist for the modern musical era.this is one band that music videos actually help, and the treadmill thing is genuinely brilliant. i for one am looking forward to more from this band. i suspect the relative lack of competing talent makes okgo a shoe-in for the next ""it"" group."
5,AMAZING!,"I had first heard of OK Go on VH1 when they were highlighting the ""You should know"" Bands. And there appeared OK GO. If you Haven't seen their music video for ""Here it goes again"" you have to! It's soooo AMAZING! But back to the music, this whole CD pretty much blew me away, because usually i'll buy a CD and the one song i've heard by them will be the only good song on the CD, however this is not the case with the album ""OH NO"" Each song is different from one another and they've got a good beat. There are fast head bopping songs and then slower mellower songs, but each type are great. OK GO is a really great band and i would suggest them to anyone. - Especially the poppy/altenative type- like myself."
5,"Come on, come on, do what you want, buy this album!!","This is one of the best albums I have heard. OK Go returns for a second round. This music is very fun and will be stuck in your head for days, I can say from experience. If you liked OK Go, you will for sure enjoy Oh No. All of the songs are different, yet the same. They all have a different feel, but are the OK Go style. All of it is easy to listen to, of course. Dan rocks out on the drums, Damian's vocals and guitar is amazing, Andy conquers the guitar and keyboards, and of course, Tim is the best bass player ever! Remember, mediocre people do exceptional things all the time!p.s. my juggling club name is hobbitfoot"
4,Newer does not ALWAYS mean better,"this is the second release from OK go, and don't get me wrong, i absolutely love this album, but i think i like the more produced sound of ok go. this album has a very live sound compared to its former. it is still a great album and i definitely! recommend you buy it. these guys are hilarious as well as good musicians. give it a listen!"
5,Amazing,"It's very rare that a sophmore album from a good band is as good as the original. It's even more rare when it's better. OKGO has done it. This album is incredible. Every tune is catchy goodness. It's hard to listen to just one track and not need to listen to the whole album....it's similar to Lay's potato chips, but minus the potato's and grease. Is it potato or potatoe? Anyway, I highly recommend this album as well as the first to anyone looking for good driving/dancing/chilling music. It fits every occasion, kinda like Kool Aid...wow. This review is full of analogies! Buy It Now."
4,A million reasons why I love this CD...,"...number one would be that it's just so infectious! Try listening to the first three songs and not having them stuck in your head all day long. I think this is an improvement on their debut- it's not as poppy, not quite as slick. There are still those dazzling harmonies, but less keyboard. More straight guitar. Just pretty good music to dance to-or rock out to.The slower songs are not as strong as the full-force-ahead ones, with the exception of 'Oh Lately It's So Quiet.' Damian Kulash has a beautiful voice- as well as being possibly one of the most gorgeous people in existance. (**sigh**in love**)The only reason I took off the one star is because of the ridiculous thirty minutes of ambient noise at the end of the album. Um. Sorry, guys, but that's just a little pretentious."
5,Can't Stop Listening,"As a reviewer, I will admit, I am not very qualified. I play music, and I listen to music, but I have no real credentials. All I can tell you is that there are 13 tracks (not including 9027 Km) on this CD, and there are 13 OK Go songs on my Top 25 Most Played Playlist. These guys are talented, spunky, and oh-so-attractive, and I simply cannot stop listening to this cd. They have wide appeal, a great blending of sounds, and I am positive that you will find something on this album that suits your fancy.They're also mighty fine dancers."
5,Great workout for over 50's,"I've been using this DVD for a week. Today 2 different people told me how well I look - they said I positively glow! Jeannine's workout is very low-impact - great for my 57-year-old bones. While it won't increase heart rate, it will help firm you up, increase flexibility, and tone your skin. I highly recommend this DVD."
4,Return Of The Spitz {4 Stars},"Count Bass D's latest effort picks up where his last effort, Begborrowsteel, left off. The Nashville, Tennessee native is a triple threat in the sense that he produces, writes, and scratches everything on the album with the exception of two songs. While it's normally a bad thing, Count keeping the same vibe from his last album release is actually a good thing because his particular style of off the wall rhymes mixed with hard beats makes for a great listening experience. Act Your Waist Size is another in the long line of dope Count Bass D albums."
2,It helped me get on the right track,"All the info in the book was standard, except the last chapter, where it got into other options after graduation. So I only found one relevant chapter for me, but for most people they might find that this book is exactly what they are looking for."
4,Great graduation gift,I bought this for a friend's graduation. He claimed it was the perfect gift- even his mother agreed! It makes that thoughtful gift giving idea that much easier (and cheaper!)
3,Make sure before you buy...,"Please make sure before you buy...Some of the specs listed (even on the SHARP website) do not match the product that you buy.The system does not have following features (may not be significant) even though the specs say it has (confirmed calling SHARP customer service).- Separate Subwoofer Volume.- Remote Volume Mute.- Headphone Jack.Based on some of the websites (not SHARP website), this system even have built in DVD-CD drive, which it actually does not have."
4,"Great Songs, Too Much Foo Foo","All the Wee Sing products teach songs I learned as a child that I enjoy passing on to my children. My youngest has Down Syndrome and is 16 now. He has earned money to collect all nine Wee Sing DVD's and enjoys them a lot. The Big Rock Candy Mountain is his current favorite but he doesn't communicate well enough for me to know why he likes it. In my opinion, too much time is given to the Little Bunny Foo Foo story woven between the songs. The story was fine; it just took up too much time-- we could have had more great songs! The video downplays the glories of all the good things to eat in the Big Rock Candy Mountain, which is nice for parents but takes away some of the magic the name of the video promises. All of the Wee Sing videos do moralize but others do it less obtrusively. Under the Sea is the worst, Marvelous Musical Mansion is best in this regard."
5,Best Money spent,The price was extremely inexpensive and my kids LOVE it. I watched it when I was a kids and now my kids do!
4,Loved this movie when I was a kid.,The Wee Sing videos are great. My sister and I would watch this video over and over again when we were kids. We still remember all the songs and all the funny dialogue. So glad they made them DVDs! Can't wait to buy them for my kids.
4,Would buy it again,"My daughter loves this move, almost as good as grandpa's magical toys! She is two and sings along and dances with all the characters ;)"
3,Bad DVD,"I had the VHS of The Big Rock Candy Mountain when my children were little (their grown now), and my children LOVED it. Now that I have a grandbaby of my own, I bought it for her so she could enjoy it. The reason for only 3 stars is, this DVD was sluggish and doesn't work! I was very dissappointed it didn't work. Maybe the low rating should be directed more towards the provider, not the item itself."
5,adorable,"My grandchildren love this just as my children loved it. Full of songs, children and magical characters, it is fast paced and fun."
5,Entertaining,"My children love this dvd. They can watch it over and over again. My 15 year old loved it years ago when I had it, now she is watching it and enjoying it all over again with her younger siblings ages 20 months and 4 years old. It is show of a girl who goes off to a land of Make Believe in Big Rock Candy Mountain. She plays and sings with her ""friends"" there and in the process learns valuable lessons from the wise owl."
2,"Big Rock Candy Mountain, dvd","I never liked this movie, my children have good memories watching it. Bad acting and corny plot.Good for young children."
1,Wee Sing in the Big Rock Candy Mountain,Not a good video for little children. My grandchild does not like the characters. There are too few characters in the video.
2,TERRIBLE VOCALS,i respect cannibal corpse and all the INSTRUMENTS. the guitar and bass is great and the drums 4 hardcore. but the singer has no musical talent! dont get me wrong i love metal i listen 2 mudvayne slipknot cradle of filth and i hate it when people say they have no musical talent but this band.i know a band isnt about vocals but these vocals just ruin the instruments. i wouldnt even bother
1,I wish I could play guitar as well as these guys.,"I can listen to this one just about anywhere. It is one of the few albums that I own that I can grab, throw in the car, and know I will want to listen to it. It has everything I want, relentless double bass, cool guitar riffs, good flow, vocal style that works with the music and not against it. On a side note I would recommend this album to anybody who is developing a need for more extreme types of music. Although I prefer the newer albums this is the album that got me interested in Cannibal Corpse."
1,Really Bad!,"It's not like I hate Black Metal and Death Metal but I think this album is very low class garbage that is put out to attract the ""freaks"". The ""freaks"" try to scare everyone by liking bands with messages that your mother would shun. It's all for shock and attention. I bought this cd for 7 dollars from a street side vendor and I think it really isn't good. The one high pitched screaming person is really annoying and adds nothing to the song except laughability. Give me a break you ""tortured souls"". Buyer beware, if you buy this, it will not make you cool or strange. Just really stupid for letting a talentless band like this sell things and making them popular. Cradle of Filth and Meshuggah run circles around this one trick pony."
5,different from the others but good,"Barnes really changed his voice on this one since Tomb of the Mutalated. He sounds just like he does on SIx Feet Under, and this album is very reminicent of Maximum Violence(also great). The Bleeding is more accessible than the first 3... but it still is deserving of 5 stars because of the catchiness and overall song structure. A bit different and slower than the older(and newer) albums but highly reccommended as well."
3,It'll make yer ears bleeeedddd!!!!!!!!,"Best thing you can do? Get this album, bite the head off a couple of chickens, then howl at the moon."
5,Ultimate Barnes,"This is in my opinion the best death metal album ever recorded.This is where the chaotic sound of Cannibal met its most mainstream metal groove. Unfortunately the band wasn't down with the more Obituary/ACDC inpsired style of groove and slash death metal, hence the breakup of perfection.I can not believe this hasn't been matched in over twelve years, but it hasn't. The Six Feet Under debut is a close second."
4,dear mr. censored,"im writing this to mr censored, who obviously is ignorent when it comes to music. if you listen to the actual music, you would know it is not picking up and instrument and banging it with no talent. you pick up a guitar and play some of the riffs played in these songs or the drumworks, and then get back to me. if you like your wimpy john mayer and stuff along those lines....music with no passion or drive, then keep it to yourself"
3,Way Better than Tomb of the Mutilated,"After Tomb of the Mutilated, I was worried that Cannibal Corpse would forever emulate unintelligible grindcore death, but the Bleeding is impressive. From the opening riffs of Staring Through the Eyes of the Dead, a sense of power is coupled with organization that previously was not included in a CC album. All the guitarwork is cool on this cd and the solos are better than before. Vocals are still grunty, but much cleaner and better recorded. Lyrics are particularly evil on this album and actually quite memorable. Stripped, Raped, and Strangled is arguably one of the best songs the band would ever write and F'ed with a Knife, Return to Flesh, and She Was Asking For It all are addicting. Death metal fans should buy."
4,What a brutal album..,This album by Cannibal Corpse is my fav...its very hard and well produced. If you like death metal..this album would be a great CD to add to your collection
1,Low taste,"This is so bad-taste, I can't understand why some people like a band like that, with no good songs at all. Even in death metal genre, there are hundreds of better bands."
1,"Doesn't offend me or anything, but is this music?","This is such a pointless band. All it is is ear candy. They can pound on their guitars and scream bloody murder, but are they any GOOD? Hardly. Every guitar riff is the same throughout the whole cd, all the lyrics are more repetitive than Jay Leno's jokes. And you can tell it doesn't take much intelligence to write on of their songs, look, I'll write one for you here:Kill scum Eat Maggots GRrrrrrrrrrrRRR Guuuuuuur growwwwwwwwwwwllll GRAP AHHHHHHH worms in hole eat dead body CARCASS!"
1,ATTENTION: This band sux! :ATTENTION,"I have a question for all the people who like this music...WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!?!?! How can you say this is violent music? You can't even understand what he's saying. And the music it self sounds like they all got high on crack picked up an instrument, and started playing. And for all of you who thinks this will scare KoRn fans, your wrong. They'll be crying alright, but only because they'll be laughing so hard! There are no meaning to the lyrics at all, he isn't any goods at song writing. And the vocals suck as much as everything else.Anyone can yell into a microphone, and talk about the many ways a person can die. All in all, if your planning on buying this CD don't. Buy something worth what it costs. KoRn is your best bet. I know in other reviews, im going to get alot of angry feedback, but guess what? Everything i just said was true."
1,Pretty sorry stuff.Has no artistic value whatsoever.,Im a big fan of metal.I love Slayer and Pantera as well as Metallica.When I bought this I was just curious to see what it would sound like.Now I see I wasted my money.All the songs sound the same and the singer absolutely sucks.Sure they can play fast but so can lots of other artists.Fast guitars should be the least important element in music.Its all about the songs and all these sick twisted folks write is crap about incest and rape.How entertaining(if you can tell Im being sarcastic).Please do not buy this worthless garbage.Thank you.
1,A SHAME TO MUSIC,"THis album shouldn't even be in the ""music"" category at Amzon, so bad it is. A total waste of time, money and everything. The ""musicians"" of this band should have their minds examined..."
3,I keep changing my mind about this but this is really gooood (4 Stars),"UPDATED REVIEW---------------Alright now, I still think the album is somewhat repetitive and unoriginal, but other than that this really kicks arse. The vocals are okay and the Corpsegrinder stuff is not that bad either. If you want something that is raw, fast and heavy -- this album never slows down. Even if you don't like the lyrics, try ignoring them and give this CD a spin. I usually don't write positive reviews this short but there's really not much that needs to be said here. Just buy this okay?"
5,best death metal album ever,the bleeding is best death metal album ever this is when barnes and cannibal corpse started to find there style and its mixes like a jarger bomb its greatness guys start with this album first then work back or foward
5,Barnes At Best,"I can definitely see where people call this a ""greatest hits"" album without even being one. It has a hits feeling just because every song on the album is good enough to be a single! I love the Bleeding and to me it is definitely the bands best work with Chris Barnes as the lead. The vocals are a little cleaner than previous albums to where you can actually hear the lyrics even if you don't know the words. Even that doesn't stop the Bleeding from being just as brutal as the ones before. This album has the song Stripped, Raped and Strangled...nuff said"
5,YOU MUST OWN THIS!!!,"I also agree with the previous reviewer that many people talk alot of s**t about this album without really knowing anything about it's musical value.People negatively review this album because they say they dont understand what the singer is saying or it's just fast metal.First of all,death metal is not about wether you understand the vocals or not.Secondly,there's alot more to this band than playing fast or being heavy.Death metal is a feeling and about creating aggressive and intelligent music.This cd is probably the most technical and melodic of all of cannibal corpse's material.Very aggressive while having alot of catchy riffs and solos.All the songs are great and no filler songs.I have always respected these guys as musicians and they deserve alot more respect than what they are getting from these idiots who are writing one star reviews.GO OUT AND GET THIS!!!"
1,Wow! What a piece of [edit]!,"Well, I never thought that I'd see the day that bands like these get record deals and put trash like this on the market. If you actually get brave enough to listen to this 'mined-numbin teknikalitee and brootality,' you'll hear nothing but noise. I'm telling you this ahead of time. Whatever lyrics are discernable are of the most morbid and disgusting variety...however I'm not disturbed, or impressed. Oops...looks like I missed the entire point of this album. These guys make Fred Durst look like an accomplished lyricist and songwriter. It's sick. It's stupid. It's more immature than anything I've ever seen or heard.You like metal? You want something worth your while that shows excellent musicianship, yet explodes with heavyness? Get something by Pantera, Mudvayne, or In Flames. That's heavy."
1,Cannibal Corpse Sucks,"This band is horrible, all of there songs sound the same. You cant understand the singer, it sounds like he has something stuck in his throat and is trying to get it out, if you dont believe me listen to the clips. They may be able to play there instruments fast but thats all, this is not real metal, this is just a horrible excuse for music. I cant believe they have fans. Listen to some real metal like metallica or even slipknot, who cares, just not these guys."
1,Just plain crap!!,"Cannibal Corpse are probably the worst death metal band ive ever heard!! I mean it's just some messed up riffs not even played on a proper scale with heavy distortion!! Im only 13 years old and im sure i could play better.And the songs, OMG they all sound the same with the gore lyrics!This is definitely not worth anything!! If u want some good technical death metal listen to bands like Crpytopsy and stuff like that."
1,Freak songs...,"This CD is bizarre, the band is bizarre. It is bad produced, unhearable because of the weight of the guitars and the growls of the singer. Skip it at all costs if you can."
2,"no saw blades, one less year warranty, reconditioned","Spend $12 more, you can get a brand new one with blades and 2 years warranty, of course, same brand and model."
5,A Wonderful Item,"I got this on the recommendation of my Vet. It is the best product I have ever used to help with doggie diarrhea. I always keep some extra around, just in case I need it."
4,Perfect for magic hour ...,"This filter is just what I needed to make images including water, mist, fog, etc... especially in the early morning and late evening hours. It is professionally and solidly constructed as well. It reduces light reaching the sensor to allow for longer exposures, but not so much that it obscures my ability to compose and focus through the viewfinder...Of course mounting the camera on a tripod is a must."
3,B+W Extreme Neutral Density,"Shooting HDSLR video at a professional level requires a full assortment of neutral density filtration. I own an extensive array of B+W filters, and this brand is largely deserving of their excellent reputation. Not many manufacturers offer extreme density, which can be essential for some still photographic techniques such as forcing long exposure times in bright sunlight, typically to deliberately create images of silky smooth moving water such as water falls. My problem with this filter may be an inherent characteristic of extreme neutral density: there is a lot of density, but it is not so neutral. In fact, my copy of this filter exhibits a pronounced color cast. This flaw is not so extreme that it cannot be corrected in post, but nevertheless it does create additional image processing work, especially if images made with this filter have to be intercut with images made without the filter."
5,Finally the real truth!,"The men surveyed for this book were asked to give honest answers about what qualities in women they find attractive, and what qualities are a real turn off. Some of the answers were quite interesting and not what you might expect! Ladies, if what you are doing is not working, buy this book to learn some simple ideas on how to catch the attention of the right man that could perhaps lead to the relationship you are looking for. I am passing this along to all of my single girlfriends... I believe their ""luck"" with men will be turning around very soon!"
3,Good Product,"This small coffee maker heats water for tea or makes drip coffee with the included permanent filter. Unfortunately, mine died in less than a year."
3,Bold designs,"There are six different stencils in this little book, printed on sturdy cardstock. They're perforated for easy removal, pre-cut, and neatly labeled. The designs are simple without being simplistic, and a perfect size for many projects. I've used them to make posters, to add color to bookcases, and just to draw on windows and mirrors with dry-erase markers. The creatures included are a mermaid, a minotaur, a unicorn, a griffin, a dragon, and a centaur."
2,An Inferior Source for Information on Eichmann,"It would, perhaps, be unfair to say there is no value in the book for those who are interested in Eichmann. However, Sachs' book in a very inferior source, in part because it is poorly researched, and sometimes the author seems to have a poor grasp of the meaning of her research materials.The author's comments in the editorial section above, which completely mischaracterize the arguments made by Hannah Arendt in her book on the Eichmann trial and which also suggest that Sachs holds the ridiculous belief that Arendt had something to do with crafting the arguments used by the Defendants in the Nuremberg trials, should give any potential reader pause."
3,I think I missed it....or it wasn't there,"I absolutely love Faithless Sunday 8am and Reverence, but this album seemed to fail at what Faithless finds the most difficult- sticking to a point. I listened to it over and over to find the genius I have come to expect, but frankly I would prefer to listen to the Back to Mine mix as opposed to this new on."
3,Not as good as Sunday 8pm,"Not a bad album, just not nearly as good as the stellar Sunday 8pm. I've listened to it a couple of times now, and it has started to grow on me a little, especially ""One Step too far"" which has a wonderful Blondie-esque baseline. The single (?) We Come 1 is a pretty standard dance trac without any real merit; Not enuff love bites, and Maxi Jazz's ramblings are starting to get a little old on this one."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this CD because of another Faithless song that I had loved in the past. I was expecting trance and well, it started out strong, but he talks through the whole thing, and then moves more towards rap then trance. I don't know how the CD ends because I couldn't listen through the whole thing. It was interesting, but not my cup of tea. Try to listen to the samples before buying to make sure its what you're really looking for."
4,Credit due to Rare Bird,"Faithless defies categorization and they get as much credit for creating music as they do for knowing and reviving forgotten songs. It appears to me that most aficionados and critics out there failed to note that ""Not Enuff Love"" is actually an old hit song ""Sympathy"" by a one-hit-wonder sixties band called ""Rare bird""."
3,"Good, but not like Sunday","I was just cruisin the record rack and lo and behold Faithless released a new cd right under my nose that i had somehow missed. Anyway i picked it up instantly without hearing anything off it and Im not disapointed. I do not think it is near the quality of their last album...Ive kind of grown a little weary of all these trance songs. But as always, Faithless hit them GOOD, putting their own original signature on it. I find some of the vocals on the record a bit too much. Im not a big fan of the singing on ""Not Enuff Love"", and Zoe's voice seems to shapeshift from sounding akward to amazing. The CD is good, but if you are new to Faithless or are looking for a cd to diversify yer collection, get Sunday 8pm first. Its much more thought out and technically well produced."
5,Mad Flava!,"This CD is a hidden treasure...A Surprise in a world of commercial beats and CDs that focus on record sales instead of true music that sounds good! I am a traditional R&B, Hip/Hop, Jazz, Neo/Soul lover with a penchant for euro/Fusion and other funky world flavas. This CD will appeal to anyone that loves good music no matter what the Genre. Don't miss this piece, it's poetic, deep, funky, captivatingly fresh...it's unbelievably TIGHT!!!"
3,"Not quite what I expected, but growing on me","I bought this CD as a result of having bought ""Back to Mine: Faithless"" through an Amazon promo. Considering the source material, I thought I'd find plenty to like on a retrospective collection. This isn't to say that it's ""bad"", just different. Their source material derives from classic soul and funk foundations; the remixes take those sources to extremes in crafting new textures. This is definitely an album to move to, either on your feet or on wheels. It doesn't lend itself much to simply hanging out on the couch. I'm intrigued enough to follow the retrospective material back to the original albums to see what else they've been doing. Ah, an adventure!"
3,I Guess Our DJ Is Human After All,"Clapton was God. God was a DJ. Now God is on sick leave. Their crown, their guts, never giving away the main chorus or musical line anywhere near the first five minutes of a song, preferring to tease you slowly towards a climax, doesn't work this time. `We come 1' doesn't deliver the goods and builds up only to become one with `Total Eclipse of the Heart'. The association with 80's female singers doesn't stop there. Only God might know their obscure reasons for featuring on three tracks this Zoe Johnston who sounds like one of Mike Oldfield's endless nieces... C'mon Sister Bliss: no angel voices, we wanna get kicked, we want Maxi to give us more of his verbal riffs...Amen..."
2,Out of Perspective,"This has to be one of the most dissapointing albums i know. How come a dance group like Faithless with great hits like insomnia and god is a dj, make an album where 90% of the songs are as far from that stuff as possible. The only song that really got the same sound as we remember from older days is ""We come 1"" easily the best song on the album. If you like Dido there's a song with here too called ""One step too far"". Dido was a member of the group before she went solo. The way of singis is the same as before on the tracks with a chorus, but ""Mohammad Ali"" doesn't sound like anything you previously heard of. There as some slow instrumental dance tracks too, but none of them are anything special. This album was dissapointing, i really thinkl they could make things better."
3,outrospective,"shortly after i bought this cd the reperspective album was released i was so frustated because reperspective had more remixes, an enhanced video plus 2 non-lp tracks. but this album has an entirely different remixed songs which was quite ok though. personaly i dont have the singles so its worth it. but i suggest that if your going to buy this try buying reperspective instead because it so much better.about the album, its nice because through the years we hear faithless trying to reinvent its style and i see that every time they try they never fail. you wont go wrong if you listen to this group. and i cant wait for their next work"
4,CD with a bit of a conscience,"It isn't as uptempo as Sunday 8 AM as there are only three songs that are really moving. But darn it there is sumpin to be said about an album that makes you think about society at large and your place in it. One particular lyric during the last song talking about how someone must have conviction in their soul as the basis for their existence and going on really struck a chord. I have only listened to the album once so far and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This album compares favorably to George Michael's 'Listen Without Prejudice'. If you're expecting a dance album, or a trance like compilation look elsewhere. If you're looking for a thinking man's album so to speak I would highly recommend this."
5,>>>>>>>>>>,"Faithless adds a key element to the creation of electronic music, intelligence. He has the ability to juxtapose instumentally chilled beats, hard electronic and lyrical funk with true mixing talent. It's perfect for those who are ""lounge"" at heart that occasionally like to kick it up."
5,A Classic,"While some electronica songs are able to survive the years, it is rare that an entire electronica album can do the same.To this day, this is still a go to album. You can just hit play at track 1 and forget it until the album finishes. In fact, Outrospective should really be listened to the whole way through as it tells a story, running the emotional gamut from the lows we experience in life to the highs when we feel a sense of great accomplishment.At the same time, the emotions the album induces seem to transcend our daily lives, and give a sense that there is a lot more to these experiences.Overall, a very empowering album with lots of catchy tunes!"
3,I Guess The DJ Seems To Be Human After All,"Clapton was God. God was a DJ. Now God is on sick leave. Their crown, their guts, never giving away the main chorus or musical line anywhere near the first five minutes of a song, preferring to tease you slowly towards a climax, doesn't work this time. `We come 1' doesn't deliver the goods and builds up only to become one with `Total Eclipse of the Heart'. The association with 80's female singers doesn't stop there. Only God might know their obscure reasons for featuring on three tracks this Zoe Johnston who sounds like one of Mike Oldfield's endless nieces... C'mon Sister Bliss: no angel voices, we wanna get kicked, we want Maxi to give us more of his verbal riffs...Amen..."
5,"A ""Must Read"" for Nonprofits!","This is one of the most practical and readable books in the field. Almost every nonprofit organization produces a newsletter; far too few do it effectively. This book can change that! Every chapter has an idea that can be put to use immediately -- and not only for newletters. The author's writing and presentation provide a great model for all donor communications. (It would make a great text for a writing course -- and it's fun to read.)I want to put this little gem in the hands of every one of my clients. So, I'm off to order more copies!"
3,Raising More Money With Newsletters Than Your Ever Thought Possible,"Ahern provides a good review of basic information. Good for newbies, but seasoned professionals will probabaly not find it particularly new or innovative.East-to-read layout and type font. If you're just starting out or need a good review, this is the book you need."
4,short & to the point,"This is a mercifully wonderful book - it's short, to the point yet actually packed with essential data any fundraising writers should know. Thus, very useful to have as a guide with essential bullet point data."
4,Action and Humor,"Contains 7 chapters. The first 5 complete the storyline began in book 1. Tenchi has been challenged to a duel, the prize? Ayeka's life! And what is the secret behind Minagi (Ryoko's Twin)?.....Chapter 6 Tenchi's Ill, but with nurses like these will he ever get better?.....Chapter 7 Oh My God! Mihoshi driving a CAR!"
2,Too elementary,"When I received this, I was expecting more information about using a telescope. Instead, it's a very general book. I wish I would have saved this $ and put it toward a more informative book on space."
5,Hilarious!!!!!,This book was so funny!! I couldn't stop laughing. You really feel a part of the family because you can relate to at least one thing but most likely many more!! It is set up in a great format and is very readable for all. I am going to recommend it to anyone I come across!!!!
5,Laugh-out-loud funny!,Baker is definitely on the front lines of parenting. Her stories ring true and had me laughing in recognition!! I'd recommend this book to anyone.
3,Order a couple and see which one works?,"I ended up ordering three of these and returning two as defective.Apparently there is a problem in the coffee ground holder: two of mine clogged and kept locking up the pump. The third is a different design and has pressure relief holes which seem to work ok. The 3rd machine had a defective grinder. The one I have now works great. ANYWAY the machine is a bargain if it keeps working since it includes a grinder for the same price as a separate unit, but it is reportedly a new model andd one of the techs at the number Briel provides says they don't know a whole lot about the reliability at this point. I'm keeping mine and getting an extended warranty. Makes great espresso/lattes when it is working."
2,"Looks Great, Works Great--for a while","When I got this machine I was in love with it. It was rugged and out-performed every other machine I owned. However, within a year it was on the fritz. There is nowhere in the USA for repair other than in New Jersey. Living across the country I wasn't about to ship the machine there so it ""might"" get fixed. I repaired the thing myself and got another 6 months out of it. Finally too much started to go wrong with it. It is now in the pile of disgarded machines.We use our machines two or three times a day for multiple drinks--light commercial use for a home. This machine should have been able to handle the volume, but service and parts are lacking, or a long time in coming. I am now going to buy a Pasquini Livia 90 to replace this machine. Lots more money, but proven durability."
5,Tomlin's Tour de Force,"The word ""Tour de Force"" may not have been invented with Lily Tomlin specifically in mind, but she is one of the best people for whom this epithet should be used. I've seen her do this show live, twice, when it first came to Philadelphia, and enjoy repeating the experience via the video, and the book. She's an amazing performer, and this is an amazing piece of theater."
3,Firstly damaged then not level.,The first table we received was badly damaged (ruined Christmas gift) the next one was ok but I'm finding it impossible to make level. I think it's warped which is a shame because the table it self is very well put together.
4,What if Hitler had stopped in 1938?,"Most books written about Hitler concentrate on the Holocaust or World War Two and rightfully so. These are the two most prominent events for which Hitler is known. Fest takes a different perspective on Hitler by writing on his life before he unleashed terror on the world.Fest is NOT a Hitler apologist though. He clearly states that in his prologue. His thesis does highlight the patriotic Hitler who was successful in bringing back the pride to Germany. Unfortunately he had to throw it away with the war.It may be counter-factual history, but Fest makes the reader think: What if Hitler had stopped in 1938?"
2,Mediocre Journalism at Best,"I first read this in my youth, almost thirty years ago. I re-read it last week and can only say that I am embarrassed for Fest as well as for my own indiscriminate youth. This book has research without thought, facts without synthesis, and length without depth. It is the work of a journalist, not a historian."
2,Stanton S-250 Single DJ CD Player,"I have used this for only about 2 months for my business. It worked great until this last week. I'm getting a delayed start time and much skipping. I am no longer able to use it for my business because of it's inconsisitency.I didn't receive any warranty or trouble-shooting information with the product, only basic operational instructions. So, now I'm in the process of tracking this information.Hopefully, this can be resolved satisfactorily (and quickly)! If so, I'll certainly upgrade the rating!"
2,Not for frequent use,"We operate two dance studios, our Cd players are used every day. Just play, some fast forward/return when the girls practice a certain move.I own(ed) a total of four of them, and considering that we use one at each studio, that means each current unit is a replacement. I added the replacement plan after the 2nd failure, which paid for itself for number 3. Number 3 is failing now again, too. Yes, I could get it replaced again, but since that means that I have a dance studio for one day at least w/o a CD player, I am switching brands now.The play button stops being responsive, its not stuck, but the intructor have to hardpress it several times to get it to play, and after a while (based on 2 previous failures), even that won't trigger a response anymore.Can't say anything about cue or any other features, as we don't use them. I thought a DJ system is built for heavy use, well, this one isn't."
5,"As promised, great price and delivery","We recently bought a house that had this line of fixtures and needed 2 of these rings for the ensuite. Couldn't believe the price at regular retail. we bought 2, had both shipped and all in was less than 1/2 the price of one from a local plumbing shop. This line isn't sold in big box stores. Installed in a flash, great mounting plate (cast as well). Look and work great!"
3,Little expensive,"Beautiful replica of the 49ers mini helmet, but with cost of the helmet and shipping,I feel that the price was to much. Carl Allen"
1,Not up to the Expectations,"Pre-RaphaelitismOnly the 56 pages of the book is on ""Pre-Raphaelitism"". The rest of the book consists of other notes by John Ruskin. These notes are not about Pre-Raphaelitism. In the part about what the title suggests, there is few on Pre-raphaelitism, but more on Turner and other Victorian painters. The book is unsatisfactory for the readers who want to learn about Ruskin's views on Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelites."
3,"Still looks classy like a Cross, but sure doesn't feel and write like one.","From the time I opened the packaging, I was disappointed with the pen. The box is made of cheap cardboard, nothing like the classy boxes Cross pens used to come in, and there is a big ""Made in China"" sticker on the back. Now, for a pen company known to be all American finding that the pen is made in China is a letdown. The quality seems OK. Most people complain about the thickness of the medium nib and when using ink rather than a cartridge it was literally horrible. The strokes were more than a millimeter thick and ran through most types of paper, but when I tried out the Cross cartridges things improved drastically and now it's quite acceptable. Gave the pen a month to get used to my style of writing to see how smooth it becomes, it is acceptable.Does not live up to the Cross brand and product quality of the 90's."
4,"Great Game, Sci-Fi action game fans should not outlook","This is one original sci-fi action game that should not be passed, imaginative graphics...sometimes it looks like some modern fine art. Regarding the actions, you can actually use tactics to accomplish instead of brute force since you can command individual soldier for a particular action, but just do not expect strategic implementations like Rainbow Six. Evolva game engine is excellent, but if they could make the genohunters more human-like and carry ""modern"" types of weapons that mutate with the enemies' genes, that would look much better and make more ""sense"". Nevertheless, Evolva is a good game and at times addictive, with the nicely designed missions, very fine AI and fantastic graphics, it is one enjoyable game indeed."
4,THE JOY OF CHANGING SEASONS,"A story of a year's changing seasons is always illuminating for children, especially for those so young that waiting for winter to turn into summer seems an eternity. Pair that progression with the growing of edibles, as in ""The Good Brown Earth,"" and you have a peaceful story that will help youngsters appreciate the world in which we live.Joe and his grandmother are the best of friends. They spend a great deal of time together tending to a vegetable patch. As the story opens it is fall and the pair are turning over the earth. Their next visit to the patch takes place during the winter as Gram thinks about all the good things in her gardening book, and Joe builds a snowman.Of course, spring follows for planting and summer for growth. Best of all is the harvest when all ""Gram's plants are standing tall and ripe and lush.""Repeated throughout is the phrase ""And the good brown earth got on with doing what the good brown earth does best,"" a reminder of the value of our soil."
4,mindblowing!,"I will like to highly recommend this for those who are seeking to the WHOLE TRUTH. Not a part of it, THE WHOLE TRUTH and this book really breaks it down scientifically and mathematically with such accuracy like no other. Since science and math as well as history seem to be my favorite subjects to browse in and build my understanding of the cosmos of this universe, I am glad I got this book. Never in my mind that I thought a book like this one exists!"
1,Anti-Semitic rubbish,This book basically rejects everything modern archaeology has to say about the Great Pyramid in favor of a view that twists the facts (and don't believe anything in it that Capt says is fact without checking it) to fit into a fundamentalist religious perspective. Its author was a great supporter of the anti-Semitic Christian Identity movement.
5,Excellent Quality,You cannot go wrong with these restored westerns---Color is bright as the day they were released----Black & Whites are nice and clear---A great buy
1,Fiction From the World's Most Famous Phonies,"These two are still at it, peddling fiction for fact and attempting to convince the world that we are surrounded by the supernatural. A car in the garage, two chickens in the pot and demons in every basement seems to be these folks favorite slogan. Having interviewed several reputable parapsychologists who regard them as ""ambulance chasers"" of the psychic phenomenon world, I have no compunctions whatsoever in labeling these two exactly what they are: opportunists straight out of the middle ages..."
4,Reality of the Incarnation of God becoming a man,"I got this book because I heard it reccommended on the radio by Swindoll. It is a very short simple easy to read book which, though I was expecting it to be deeper and more insightful, the simple clear presentation of what that day may have been like for these mere mortals involved in it presented in such a simple mundane matter of fact way moved me to tears repeatedly. This book helps you to put God's coming as a human being in the flesh and all the awe and grandeur of it into a perspective that is more easy to see in grasp for us humans."
3,No cover.,My turntable has no plastic cover that keeps it off the dust. I don't know where to buy it.
1,"Great Player, but where is the needle??????","I was excited to unpack this beast. I especially liked the blue illumination, but when I wanted to demonstrate to my kids what you can do with this mechanic marvel, I was disappointed that the needle was missing!!! The whole reason I bought this, was that I have an old one with a broken needle. So I spent 280 bucks, for a new needle and what did I get? Another turntable without a needle (or cartridge) Bummer!!!!"
1,From a concerned parent,"This book has very mature themes that I don't feel appropriate for young audience. Aside from some violence and profanity (including several ""s-words"" and one ""f-word""), there are two very graphic sexual scenes. The first one has a very descriptive disrobing scene where the boy ""stimulates"" the girl. The second involves full-blown intercourse with the boy buying and experimenting with condoms before hand. The second scene also makes reference to the girl smoking a joint prior to intercourse.My 11-year-old son brought this book home from his school library. Very troubling that this should be in an elementary school..."
4,Being blind isn't only with your eyes,"I thought that this book was a very exciting!!!! Kirk although short was brilliant. I liked how when he thought about stuff he would write it out in poems or ""ramblings"" as he put it. I thought it was well written also and the plot was good. I liked the fact that they had described with so much detail it kind of felt like you knew how he felt like you were there or you knew how he was feeling. I also like how Glenn had befriended him and used his ""ramblings"" as lyrics for his songs and then when he played with the socks band they used his song. I just really liked this book the only thing I didn't like was when they really went in to detail with Kirk and Laurens moments. But other than that it was a good book."
3,A short Wilkie Collins work,"This is a review of the free Kindle version.A Rogue's Life comes in at just under 1,800 locations.It's interesting reading Wilkie Collins's views on the work 20 years after writing it. His melancholy thoughts of his dead friends definitely grabs you.The rogue is an interesting sort, making his living with as little work as is possible. It's not too shocking that he ends up in some criminal activities. This definitely falls in the classic sensation category.The ending is pretty remarkable - I definitely chuckled about how and who the rogue ends up working for.The story is marred by some casual anti-Semitism, not that unusual for the time."
5,Perfect box,I needed something to collect payments in. This works perfectly. The product arrived promptly and in great condition. I like that I can wall mount or stand on a counter.
5,Give this girl a Grammy,Lauren Gifford is the most talented new artist. I am completely enamoured with her ability. She is a breath of fresh air. She has the most beautiful voice. She should get a Grammy for best new artist.
4,So good,"This album is so good. My favorite song is definitely ""Five Years."" It's better than the original version."
4,The Zen of Bowie,"Accompanied only by an acoustic guitar, Seu George uncovers the inner cool--the Zen of Bowie. It's great to hear my favorite songs in a new way, and also to get to know some classic Bowie tunes for the first time."
1,"No Space Oddity, NO STARS",I am sorry to make this album only have a bonus song via itunes is the worst thing ever.
4,Excellent,"I must say, I think this soundtrack is nicer than his own CD as it has most of the well known versions (like the David Bowie ones). His voice is very mellow and it is a great choice for background music during parties."
1,BABBLING BROOKE,"Ah, the joys of the Internet. Their influence continues to spread, giving us movies like VLOG. Our obsession with blogs and vlogs and etc. however does not always translate into entertainment. I was so bored I must admit I didn't even finish it. I think I'll stick to real movies."
5,I love this tool!,"I did my homework before getting a thread gauge. This gauge has the most gauges in it, for one tool, that you will find. It basically has ever thread you'll ever run across in it."
5,Hamilton Beach 7 qt slow cooker,"Ordered two of these, and shipped to Florida.One arrived with a broken pot, and Amazon sent a free replacementas soon as I notified them!Now both of them are in my possession, and they have been given as a gift toa Christian ministry in Bogota, Colombia, who used BOTH of them last week to cookFOUR large chickens for the ministry people.They worked JUST FINE. No fancy bells and whistles, just low or high settings.We are WELL pleased with this product. aND ESPECIALLY PLEASE WITH THE QUICK RESPONSE FROM AMAZON!!A. SVENDDAL, RB MINISTRIES"
4,Easy to use,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He made us a pot roast in it and it tasted great and the crock pot itself was very simple to use.I decided to go with this particular model for a number of reasons. The most important being that it does not have the rubber seal around the lid, like the other ""stow and go"" models. Many people complained of a smell remaining inside of the rubber, so I went with one that wouldn't have the same problem.The price on this product is very reasonable and I liked that this model doesn't have a bunch of bells and whistles. Once you started adding all these different kinds of functions and features, then it just becomes too complicated. Crock pots were made to be simple and that's what I like about this model."
2,Nope,"I've been using a cheapo Crock Pot 4qt slow cooker for the past few years, and we loved the meals so much I wanted a larger version, so I could freeze leftovers. I bought this based one the price and reviews. The exterior gets so hot you (or a child) could get burned by accidentally touching it. I would worry about leaving it unattended for hours, which is the whole point of slow cookers. I tried my usual recipes for spaghetti sauce and beef stew. Unimpressed. The stew was still watery, not rich, after 10 hours of cooking. Sauce not up to the usual standard. Returning this and moving on."
1,Not Good,I think I used this total of 6 times before the crock cracked. I had my other crock pot for 12 years before it even cracked and that was because my son accidentally dropped it. I think the base is poorly made. I would not buy this product again!
3,Good product except for the lid. Price is good.,"I like the size and the oval shape and find it easy to clean. I like the stainless steel, but it is very thin. I was surprised by the thin, cheap quality of the lid. I'm used to the thick glass lids that fit nice and snug. This is very thin and lightweight and is a bit too small and sits unevenly as well...there are small gaps. Our old, inexpensive slow cooker was definitely made better and I wish I still had it. Unfortunately our daughter dropped the ceramic insert, which was full, and it broke. I looked everywhere for one that had an ""auto"" setting that would cook on high for 2 hours and automatically switch to low. Not to be found.After cooking a few meals in it we've decided it's worth keeping. If it had cost more it would have gone back. Keep in mind they just don't make them like they used to unless you're willing to fork out some serious money."
2,Extreme low quality...,"I have never seen an electric cooking appliance this cheaply made ever. You can literally push the outside ""metal"" in with a finger with light pressure. All the metal inside and out are extremely thin gauged, just a tad thicker than foil. The glass cover is thin also, but the worse part is the handle. It is very tiny and shallow. The only way to hold it is with your finger tips. I am returning this."
4,"Still smells over a month later, but still happy with it.","I'm happy with it. I think you need more than a month to assess a mattress, but so far, I'm happy. I sink further in the mattress than a regular mattress, but I think I feel better in it.I read the reviews about it smelling like chemicals -- and the review of one guy who said ""IT NEVER SMELLED"". Friends, it still smells chemically -- kind of like a chemical hazelnut or something (??) I don't notice it all the time, but it really does smell STILL, not just after a day or two."
2,"Sorry, I tried","I really wanted to like this mattress especially for the price, but when I got it dissapoitment was the only thing I could feel. I know memory foam in general is firm but this mattress in my opinion is just hard. You dont sink into it, you can only feel your body break the surface but after that it is still so hard. If you're thinking about buying this mattress just beware that buy8ing a mattress before you use it is not a wise decission, and i learned that the hard way"
5,Great Nights Sleep,It's been a month since we've received our bed (or nearly) and we love it. It arrived the day after we ordered it (CA to FL) during the Christmas season! The bed has been wonderful to sleep on. It's actually very hard to stay awake once you get into bed. It hugs your body. It took a little while to get used to it after sleeping on traditional beds all my life. We are very pleased with the bed. It does get a little warm but we were told that a mattress pad would help with that (it's been a chilly winter so it hasn't been bad yet).
3,so firm,"i read so many reviews and did so much research prior to ordering a mattress online. This one is a good deal and value for the money. One thing, it is SO firm. I've no issue with it, didn't mind the very mild smell (reminded me of any 'new' plastic smell). But it really is very firm. I'm now searching for a topper to soften things up a bit."
5,Best Investment Ever,"I love this bed.I have a bad back. I am 6'1"" and go about 250 lbs. I have been told that I will need surgery. I snore and don't sleep well.My wife and I bought this to replace a 10 year old Serta traditional mattress for our Christmas present three weeks ago. Since then I have had a significant reduction in back pain, enough so that I am not only postponing surgery, but am able to work out again. Additionally, I wake up feeling much less stiff and sore and much more rested. Three weeks does not guarantee a solution, but it is the most relief I have had from my back in 25 years.The notes about the chemical odor are pretty accurate. It does smell, but it seems to dissipate within a couple days. It also sleeps a little hotter than I was accustomed to, but not enough to make it uncomfortable.The delivery time on this was about 1 week and I was pretty thankful to have an elevator. It is heavy so have help available."
3,Not sure anymore...,"I was so excited about this bed...and for about the month that I've had it I really enjoyed it...however as of late, I have been waking up with back pain...which was the whole reason I bought a new bed. In my opinion the bed has a distinct impression where I sleep (I'm an average size person so it shouldn't make a difference). The firmness feels gone."
5,"Great deal, great mattress! I got blood on mine","I finished moving and unpacked the mattress. When I came back from eating some food like the fat guy I am, I had to plop down on the mattress to try it out. I had blood on my leg which smeared on the memory foam. It doesn't seem to wash out very well, so I recommend taking precautions to not get blood on your own mattress.In all seriousness though, this deal is great, free shipping is convenient and fast, and the 5"" of memory foam beats the 3"" found in the cheaper versions. I love it!"
3,"Thick, soft, some smell","First, I want to make a disclaimer that I only used it for 2 days. This mattress is generally good. It is really thick, and I do not need to buy a box (I hate boxes...). It is not as hard as described in other reviews--as I like harder mattresses, this is not as good as my expectation, but it's still nice so I decide to use it for a few more days to decide whether to keep it. The good part: I feel nice sleeping on it, and the memory foam fits my back perfectly. There is still some chemical smell, some smell between alcohol and acetone, or some other organic solvents(which would be worse...). I expect it to disappear in a few days..."
2,HARD AS A ROCK!!!,HARD AS A ROCK!!!wish it was softer I gotta say I am disappointed with this purchase If you are looking for something not super firm don't buy!!thanks Jameson
4,Took time to get used to but we love it now!,"This is a great mattress. The first one we received was damaged and had to refuse the delivery. I explained to Amazon that we had already given our old mattress away and even though their policy is to wait for the item to be returned for a refund, but they sent me a new one immediately. Took about a day to fully expand and I didn't notice a smell when I opened it up.I ordered it in February and it took until July before I could say I really liked the bed. It is so comfortable now but it took some time for us to get used to the firmness of it."
5,glad we took a chance,"We were very nervous about ordering a mattress online and waited several months before offering a review. We are just as pleased with our choice now as we were when we received it almost 10 months ago. We didn't have any problem with the odor that others have mentioned, the mattress is really comfortable, and looks the same today as the day we got it(no sagging spots etc). Our previous box spring and mattress, which we paid 3 times as much for, was never this perfect."
5,Stuck in My Mind,"I first heard this song on Cold Case last year and it has haunted me ever since! I had tried just about everything to find out the name and singer of the song (all I could do was hum the tune and I knew a few of the words) and finally my sister suggested I go to the internet. I saw Donnie Darko a few years ago, but the song did not have any relevance then, so, I will be renting the DVD this weekend. I love this song and will be purchasing the CD."
2,fun and funny punk rock but the joke gets old,"I'd really give Destroyed by Sloppy Seconds 2.5 stars. It's a fun album with funny lyrics, but it kind of gets old near the end. I pull this CD out every once in a while for some high energy three-chord slamming, but I rarely listen to the entire CD straight through and it goes back on the shelf not in my steady ""heavy rotation"" CD section. It's hard to be a joke band that people take seriously... so I think Sloppy Seconds would be pleased with a two start rating. They don't want to be complicated progrock like Yes, and they do what they do well - it just gets boring after multiple songs of goofball joke lyrics and repeated power chords. If you like the Dead Milkmen, Circle Jerks, Green Day, or Blink182 listen to Destroyed by Sloppy Seconds it's worth checking out."
1,WE WANT BETTER PRICES,YEAH $20 may not seem much to you but and postage and exchange rate into Australia it becomes $35!!!!
3,my oversight,"Decent transfer but it was my oversight not to verify it had an English track. So for you all out there, this is Spanish only"
4,Knit and Crochet with Beads,Very informative book. Gave some great ideas on how to add beads to some of my projects.
5,Something for everyone!,"This book has something for all..those who knit, crochet, beginners and advanced. I particularly liked the different techniques Lily uses to attach beads at various stages of your project. You can bead before, during and after starting your project. There are also lots of ideas for designing your own projects and using beads to jazz up an existing pattern. She shows how to add beads to different stiches so if you have a single crochet sweater..you can graph and add beads yourself!! I also love the patterns....very modern and classy. Good job Lily!"
5,Great,If you are an experienced knitter this is a great way to expand your options. I love a number of the patterns and the instructions are clear. This is a great book but may be a little tough for a beginner.
5,THE one book I would recommend to my colleagues and clients,"If I could only recommend one book on women's health to my colleagues and clients, this would be it. Unlike other women's health books, this one recognizes that health and well-being is more than simply the presence or absence of illness or physical conditions. It's time that women learn about their bodies and health in the context of their lives and not just out of a medical textbook. I applaud the authors for their appreciation of women's diversity, both in bodies and lifestyles, and the personal uniqueness that each of us can learn to cherish. Every woman should have this book."
3,The Revision isn't an improvement if you're under 30,"When this book came out in the 70's it was incredible. I loved it. It taught me so much about my own body!Now that I'm looking to give that same resource to my children, I went straight for this book -- only to find that the revision has changed its focus toward menopause and politics and away from some of the basic stuff that I needed a good resource for when _I_ was 13, and my daughter needs now. I had hoped to use it as a backup/supplement to our ""big talk"", but am looking for a better alternative.The new stuff would be fine, if it were ADDED to, instead of replacing some of the old stuff."
2,Sizing & strings a problem!,"This is a metal frame with fabric draped over it and tightened. The stitching is not perfect, it is actually pretty flawed, but it will work (unless you pull a string, then the seam splits). The sizing listed online is for the base, but these boxes are actually trapezoids that are wider at the top than bottom so if your measurement is close - beware it may not fit. There is a piece of cardboard covered in fabric in the bottom - don't get it wet! Spot treat with water and hand soap to clean other areas."
4,Be careful with measurements,"This bin is super cute and looks great with the matching sheet in a blue room with brown furniture. But beware of the measurements if you are working with a tight space like under a changing table. Measurements said 10 inches high, when I got it it was actually 10.25. That .25 is exactly what I needed to clear the top shelf. So disappointed to have to return. But found plain brown and blue bins that were smaller (and cheaper) that actually look pretty great."
4,Practical,"While this is in the ""baby"" section I am using it for my 10 year old daughter. It is large enough for her 18 inch doll collection and another for her bountiful collections of yarn. Her room's initial 30 second impression is clean and collected. I like the pattern of the fabric (although it is not as thick as you might expect) and the metal sturdiness of the top. It serves its purpose."
4,James Jones,Excellent book. Story about a playwrite who becomes obsessed with deep sea diving and the bond he forges with diving instructor at the expense of his wife and friends. His wife is a former call girl who wants to make herself a better life as she tries to change him from wild playboy to respectable husband. The guilt of a past relationship with another female character in the book haunts him. I couldnt put the book down as with all the James Jones books I have read. Not as good as From here to eternity but well worth the read. I would put James Jones as the class of Post WWII American authors.
3,Blar,"Okay, I thought that i was buying the adam ant movie, Love Bites, but instead i ended up with a french film that is also titled Love Bites. This is just a warning to all possible purchasers that you may not necessarily be buying the movie you expect. I liked the movie anyways considering it was interesting and french, but it was definitely not the adam ant filled fun fest that i anticipated."
2,Just as Expected,"Good product, a small summary of some of the titles in the book. The book is really all that is necessary to prepare for the exam. The first 35 pages is all you supposedly really need to prep."
3,"Good outline, but needs fleshed out.","Gene O'Neill, White Tribe (Dimensions, 2006)Novella-length piece from O'Neill (the ""about the author"" bit says he's turning this into a full-length novel) about an Indian legend awakened from its deep sleep and the rural coastal town it terrorizes. The length is its biggest problem, and I'm hoping that a full-sized novel will get us farther into the lives and motivations of these characters (as well as giving us a bunch more minor characters for said creature to gobble up); what we have here is outlines of characters and the occasional skeleton. It's enough to make me want more, but as it stands, it's not complete yet. If you look at this as a teaser for the hopefully-forthcoming novel-length version, it does its job quite well, but as a finished piece, it feels incomplete. ***"
5,awsome,"i still remeber buyin this tape as it was back in the day, i have been surching for this cd for way too long. i love the sound of it, i really have nothing to say other then buy it"
5,Possibly the greatest industrial album ever recorded!!!!,"For God's sake, stay away from the very weak ""Eastside Militia"". It can't even touch the intensity of this recording. There isn't a bad song on the whole disc. Industrial or not, IT FREAKIN' ROCKS!!!"
2,Second-Rate Industrial Band,"At least the cover looks cool but ... I can't say much for the music. This is derivative, second-rate industrial metal at a time when it was becoming a trendy genre to get into in order to make a little money. The production is murky and uninteresting. The music and vocals all just kind of blend together song after song. This cd bored me to death!"
4,"If You like this album, move to Poland","I really like this album. Maybe the vocals are not perfect, but the rest is OK. One thing, that pisses me a bit is the Suture sections. They make me say ahhh!Two days ago I have bought this album (new, in a shop) for about 2,5$. Isn't that nice?Pyta bya dostpna w Empiku na Nowym wiecie. Zapraszam do grzebada. Pyty od 9,99 ,- , a kasety od 2,99,-"
4,steal this review,"I picked this one up in a reject bin and it was a real surprise. It's packed with interesting artists and obscure, interesting material. Everything from John McLaughlin to The Residents. Even has a great live version of Fire (Jimi Hendrix, of course). There's probably nothing new to people familiar with individual artists on the disc but there's such a huge mix of artists all but the most hard core hunter and gatherers will find someone or something new. Definitely worth a listen - just to find new artists to check out."
4,Prompt Order!,"I was quite happy to get my jeans on time. The order promptly reached my house. I am pretty happy with my jeans. One day I was searching Amazon's web site, just killing time when I saw a pop up ad for this item. Few weeks before that I had gone to their web site with an intent to buy the jeans but couldn't since it was expensive.Now all I had to do was to click the links to log in and place the order. All was done in a jiffy. Hassle and haggle free online shopping."
3,Lee Jeans OK,Just Ok. For the price the Costco jeans are better quality for half the price. Was going to give Lee Jean's a chance but now I know.
3,too long,"I wear a men's 36x29. It's near impossible to find a good pair of jeans that fit right. These Lee jeans are too long. They state they're 29 inches in the inseam, but they're at least a 32. They make my already short legs look a lot shorter.The material isn't as think as other reviewers have stated. That seems to be common to most jeans these days."
4,Not what I ordered,"Ordered the RELAXED FIT TAPERED LEG jeans, received REGULAR FIT STRAIGHT LEG jeans!!! Since I can wear them it's not worth the cost to return them. And they are quality Lee jeans. But I'm disappointed in amazon for the ERROR!!! So I bought my next pair of Lees from LEE."
5,Easy and good value,"I needed black pants for a trip and these were easy to find and fit as expected. I have a hard time finding my rather short leg length in stores. Price was full retail, but reasonable enough."
3,Not that good as expected,"The size and price is OK but the shape is out of fashion.Also, the quality is not OK. I don't recommend buying this item."
2,"too relaxed too large,with nerrow waist","size of the pants is very different from levis'1.i am wearing levis oringnal ,w32l32,but this one, i also chose w32l32, woo,it;s too long ,and maybe i should wear lee w33 or w34, the waist is very narrow.2. relaxed means fat ass, and relaxed legs'very relaxed'3. after i try it' i ggave it to my friends~~PS'made in mexico'very thick"
2,TOO BAGGY ON THE LEGS!,"Don't know why it's so baggy. It seems slim on the image' Disappointed because the jeans feels great and durable. Just too baggy on the leg' Lee's jeans always feel great, that's why I choose them. P.S. I choose the right size."
2,These Jeans have a flaw!,"I ordered the Pepperstone, and they developed two holes at the top of the back pockets. I got good, prompt return service from Amazon, but the replacement jeans developed the same holes after one wearing. Rather than go through Amazon again, I am working with the manufacturer (Lee Jeans) to investigate this flaw, as it is obviously not just a one time issue."
3,"Good, but flawed.","I have been wearing these jeans for a while now and I would say the overall quality is fairly good. They do, however, have one very significant flaw. The fly on these jeans is notably shorter than on any of my other work jeans (various brands). The opening is too small, which makes them very difficult to use at urinals. It's enough of a problem to where I won't buy these jeans again."
1,Cheap-broke right away,"I've actually never written a negative response before, and I've bought hundreds of products from Amazon. The first earpiece broke within a day, and the second one broke within a week or so. There doesn't seem to be a headset made that is made well, but this one was the worst I've had."
1,compatibles dont work in a photo 960,compatibles dont work in a photo 960At least not for photos. The colors come out all wrong.If you're just printing black I think theyre fine but stay away if you want photo printing capability
2,Intelligent but Unsatisfying,"The Quiet Pools (1990) by Michael Kube-McDowell - 371 pages - rating: 6/10Kube has crafted a detailed and plausible picture of the future. His characterizations have depth and honesty. Much of this novel is compelling and intriguing. Only occasionally does his writing style come off as overly verbose or inherently awkward.Unfortunately he forgot to tell a story. The Quiet Pools is little more than the build up to a sequel that was never written and quite probably never intended. One is forever waiting for this glorious Starship to set sail so that the characters Kube has so vividly painted can be challenged by the dangers of the cosmos and an adventurous undertaking.The entire book however, is just the build up BEFORE the ship launches. Perhaps I've missed the point. Ultimately the feeling one is left with is that the author has tried to do something different at the expense of failing to tell an interesting story.Claus Kellermann2006 May 8Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"
1,DashMat off color,"Overall, the product and company were good - but the color of the dashmat is no where near the caramel color of the interior.Very dissappointed."
3,Good for swaddling,"I like the size, it's big enough to swaddle. I love that it's organic. But after a few washings the softness goes away and the fabric starts to bead up and get rough. It gets the job done and I still use them, just wish they stayed the way they arrived in the package."
5,Organic bliss Trust this Swaddler!,"Organic bliss Trust this Swaddler!Simply the best blanket I have, its softness is organically perfect.Its warm and trust the goodness of organic"
1,definately not PINK,"I have no clue what color I was sent, but it is not the pretty pink shown in the picure! A total waste of money."
2,Green not blue,The color is really more of a green than a blue. The paper is also not a good quality paper. I am still looking for blue tablets.
1,AWFUL! Colors not as represented!,"I ordered this based on information and appearance that seemed like pages were PALE-colored and color of ""steno-pad green,"" only to get a bright green ""pastel"" that hurts my eyes and is useless to me for writing on. Do not bother with these garish colors for real work, unless you are planning some artistic pusuit with them. The listing of ""Pastel"" is misleading (as is the picture) and JUST NOT TRUE! I was VERY disappointed, and for the OUTRAGEOUS price one would expect something more PROFESSIONAL."
4,Great product but (beware) comes without a cartridge!,Great product but comes without a cartridge! Make sure you order a cartdrige at the same time ...
2,unoriginal and uninteresting recipes,"The recipes in this book aren't terrible, but there are so many other ""healthy"" cookbooks out there that are far better and more original -- try any of Don Mauer's cookbooks, for example, or if you care about exchanges, I have a recent Weight Watchers cookbook that is far more interesting than this one. Moreover, I was disappointed that a cookbook with the word ""healthy"" in the title would include recipes that call for ingredients such as nutrasweet and diet Mountain Dew. And the fact that many of the recipes call for brand name ingredients without any explanation makes me suspcious, too. On the whole, this just isn't a cookbook I'm interested in coming back to, and it will not be getting a permanent spot on the shelf in my kitchen."
4,Shared values of all productive work,"Some interesting history of life within and surrounding Chicago around the beginning of the last century. In the lives of the characters we see the shared qualities needed for creating productive enterprises and good art works, and for being able to appreciate either. We also see the consequences in the lives of those who fail to develop these qualities."
5,One of the best!!!!,"This is one of Ferber's best books, and one of my favorites. A must for any reader over age 14!"
4,Very pleasent music.,"This cd is a side-project of Jim matheos. Normally he's a much louder musician than on this cd.Nevertheless it's very pleasant and almost new-age like music, very accoustic and basic.Nice accoustic guitar, flute, cello, in short: perfect to ease your stressed system on a Sunday afternoon.But for shredders and proggers it might be a bit too soft."
5,Matheos - the Mastermind,"This CD is as good as all the other reviews are tellin' ya. What are you waiting for? Buy the darn thing (& go ahead & get Away With Words while you're at it). Jim is a brilliant musician. With Fates Warning alone he has accomplished enough for anyone to be proud. To also compose music this mellow, & this good at BEING mellow, just further displays his talent. If somehow you are only a fan of new age, or classical guitar & you purchase this, once you're convinced of its beauty (it won't take long), stretch out & take a chance with something else by Matheos. A Pleasant Shade of Gray by Fates Warning, or perhaps the O.S.I. work with Kevin Moore. They are MUCH heavier, but at times mellow, & they deserve a listen from anyone with a scrutinizing ear for good music. Thanks Jim - keep 'em comin'."
5,Adorable,"I needed a tape measure that was easy to use, but at the same time, was unique and looked good. I stumbled across this one, and it is awesome. I love Lucille Ball, so it's perfect for me! The retraction is smooth, when you press the button both ways. Love it, love it!"
2,very disappointed,"I have to say, after watching this I was very disappointed, some of the fights was interesting, but it was very hard for me to enjoy this compared to Chocolate. Chocolate is so much better, and worth the to own on blu-ray.From movies like this, I never expect much from the story and plot, I usually watch these movies for the fighting and action, which what this movie was all about, cheap plots put together as an excuse for the fights. I was expecting much better fighting from this movie, the trailer definitely made it seem very cool. But after watching its not that great, I'll just stick to watching the protector a billion times more."
3,It was OK but I was not thrilled,If you liked Chocolate...this will disappoint. It may have been the editing...or to much of a force of B-boy moves into the action sequences...I'm not sure. Don't me wrong...I still enjoyed the movie and gave 3 stars...but I do not agree that this sophomoric effort surpassed or equaled her first. But watch...you be the judge.
2,Disappointing!,"This book should be entitled ""The Obsessive-compulsive's Guide to Keeping House"". The lists of tasks to do daily, weekly and monthly were more than a little overwhelming. If you did all the things this book says you need to do to keep a clean, orderly home then you will have little time for anything else. There are some good ideas in here, but they are overshadowed by the to-do checklists. Also the pictures in this book are of rooms with a very sterile, minimalist look to them. Boring. The rooms are indeed clutter free and spotlessly clean, but lack character and warmth. A little like living in a hospital.I was very disappointed with this book."
2,Overwhelming and poorly organized,"This book has sat on my shelf for years virtually untouched. I always want to like it. I'll pull it down from the shelf and expect to gain some wisdom from it, but it doesn't happen. It's very pretty, but not well organized. It's filled with several lists that repeat or contradict one another. And combined together, they are simply overwhelming. I do not recommend this book."
3,It's Not Home Comforts,"My book arrived in good condition, and while it wasn't in opposition to the Cheryl Mendelson book, ""Home Comforts"", it wasn't the revelation that Ms. Mendelson's book was for me. I'm keeping it on my shelf, though."
4,Superb study of Greek warfare during the classic era.,"Dr. Hanson, a leading classical scholar, provides an excellent examination of how warfare among the Greek city-states was conducted. He places particular emphasis on how the individual soldier fought. On the one hand, combat in the front line must have been awful; on the other hand, because the armies were made up of men who had known each other for years, unit cohesion must have been very high. While thoroughly researched, Hanson does not fall back on academic jargon, and his points are easily understood by the nonspecialist. As he demonstrates, the method of warfare, while often fatal to the soldiers, left property and noncombatants unharmed. Unfortunately, later in the wars between Athens and Sparta a more complete, and thus destructive manner of warfare developed. This is an excellent book for anyone interested either in classical Greece or the history of warfare."
2,Not a scholarly read,"This book is entertaining, but it is meant for the masses. If you expect this to be a scholarly work, think again. This book is full of historical inaccuracies and over-generalizations that would make a scholar of the classics or ancient history cringe.UPDATE*Someone wanted something more exact....He writes about how the Romans won the battle of Trebia which is obviously wrong. He also neglects Athenian mercantile practices and also seems to think that the Spartans were full time farmers(which they weren't as they had the Helots) he does not mention the Spartan economy or the role of the perioikoi and bunches everyone together in a nice package that is just wrong."
3,Former Western Way of War,"Interesting book, but something seems amiss. While the Greek hoplite way of war may have been an impetus, I don't see it as being carried through to modern times. It seems there is another school that attempts to avoid standing toe-to-toe to fight through the ages - armored knights, fortresses, bow, firearms, and the nails in hoplite fighting coffin - long range artillery, armor, and air power. Still thought-provoking."
4,"Decent unit, minor flaws","If you have an an FZ50, this is your only telephoto option. Optically, it works quite well, with good sharpness across the entire lens, but some of the mechanical aspects of it could have been better done. The main problem with it is that since the FZ50 has a fixed lens, the tele-converter attaches to the camera lens by screwing onto the filter thread. These are very fine and delicate but the size of the converter makes it quite easy to accidentally damage them by cross-threading if the user is not very careful when attaching it.That said, this is a worthwhile upgrade. The optical quality is much better than a typical tele-converter and the boost in focal length it provides it startling. Be sure to check your camera's manual again before using it the first time--there are some menu settings you will want to change for best results but there's no mention of that in the documentation that comes with the converter."
4,An auxilliary lens that works notably well,This lens helped capture quality photos of elk high in the tundra of Rocky Mountain National Park along Trail Ridge Rd. last week. It also captured very good detail in scenics taken there. The added capability is well worth the price. ced
5,Simply works,I have an FZ150 and this item is compatable with it. Make sure you buy the adapter(DMW-LA5)for it. It really makes the LT55 conversion lens stick way out there so a tri-pod is a must. Ive actually taken a few pics by hand at aircraft flying by. They came out suprising good (not blurry). Even so I still say get a tripod.
3,Needs An Adapter,Your ad failed to state that this lens requires an adapter to fit the FZ7 and FZ8 camera. It took about a week to find out. I was about to return the lens.
3,Panasonic DMW-LT55 55mm Tele Conversion Lens,"I BOUGHT THIS TELE CONVERSION LENS (TC) TO USE WITH A NEWLY PURCHASED PANASONIC FZ50. YES, IT DID BRING THE SUBJECT IN CLOSER BUT I FOUND THAT BY TAKING THE 'SAME' SUBJECT WITH AND WITHOUT THE TC LENS I COULD GET THE EXACT SAME RESULTS IN PHOTOSHOP WITH ABSOLUTELY NO LOSS OF IMAGE SHARPNESS."
5,Good quality product.,I really just needed some long torx bits to get into a narrow space to remove a torx screw. I ordered these in a pinch and was suprised really that they came on nice attachment ring. No cheap plastic and the bits appear to be pretty sturdy for general use. I'm satisfied and would recommend them if you need to add to the tool collection.
1,Not the video you think,"The previous review by ""a reader in Denver"" is not a review of this video. The video ""Jazzercise"" is a 56-minute 1982 release, not a 90-minute 1994 release as the review states."
5,yummy,If you like gingershaps and lemon you will love the taste of these cookies. I am glad the amazon has them on their website.
1,Find these locally,"I'll upload a picture of the cookies from the package. The packaging is the reason for the poor review. Not a box but book packaging and no bubble wrap...I wanted cookies not crumbs. Although, I've heard the calories fall out in the breakage."
2,Not Soul Coughing,Far too much studio work and not enough life. It would have been far better for them to have recorded just him.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I saw Mike Doughty open for the Barenaked Ladies and he was horrible. I walked out until the screeching had ended. Do not waste your money on Mike Doughty! I beg you!
4,Much different than I was expecting but great nonetheless!,"I was pleasantly surprised when I gave it a listen for the first time. I had been expecting the album to go in the direction of the songs on Rockity Roll. Something with an electro feel and new wave sensibility. I was amazed at what I got while listening to Haughty Melodic. It's great to hear these songs finished as they must have sounded to Doughty while he was writing them! If I had one complaint it would be that on some songs the effects on his voice kind of take off some of the haunting clarity that his voice possesses. I am going to see him live in Boston this weekend and I can't wait! Overall the album is great, it won't leave my stereo for many moons...."
4,Fantastic Solo Debut into the World of Large Rock!,For anyone who is new to Mike Doughty do yourself a favor and listen to his other albums (Skittish/Rockity Roll/Live). You will quickly love the songs on this album even more. I am very impressed with this latest release and I can't stop playing it...Definately a must have. If you are lucky enough to see him play live dont miss out.
4,Good album,"While some songs may not be too deep on this album, Mike still makes great music and lots of songs to sing a long to. I highly recommend this CD"
4,Not M.D.'s best,"The music does not do justice to the oft poetic and tremendous lyrics of Mike Doughty. I can understand not wanting to remain a slave to the shadows of the music of soul coughing, but there is something missing here...Even the computer generated sounds of Rockity roll offer more to the lyrics...Yet, it's Mike Doughty, so buy it..."
3,Maybe we were just spoiled...,"It's possible we were spoiled by the Skittish/Rockity Roll release and by Doughty's live recordings, but this album just doesn't appeal to me as much as his other recordings.It's not that this ia a bad album by any means. I enjoyed listening to it and still do. I, however, am more of a fan of the stark, more personal sounds that Mike Doughty brings forth in his live performances (Live at Bonneroo is excellent), Skittish and Rockity Roll. Haughty Melodic seems too overproduced, and less the ""small rock"", which is the term Mike Doughty has coined for his own sound.Highlights: White Lexus, Your Misfortune, Madeline and Nine, Busting up a Starbucks (an old, but good song).Of course, I'll never jump off the Doughty bandwagon. I've been on it since 1997, when I was introduced to Soul Coughing. There is still plenty of good on this album."
4,"Fun live show, good album","In response to the review by ""MadBanker"", where he describes walking out until the screeching had ended, I gotta tell you man, you must not have seen the same concert I did. I saw Mike Doughty open for the BareNaked Ladies at the Bill Graham civic center in San Francisco, and if screeching bothers you then I don't know how you dealt with the BareNaked Ladies's revised rendition of ""You can be my Yoko Ono"". Now that was some screeching. Jesus."
5,Quirky and pleasing,"The cd is eminently listenable. I pefer Doughty's solo vibe to the older Soul Coughing gig with which he ran. Check out the laughable lyrics (most noteworthy of which: ""keep the wrong hands from the biscuit fortune"" in Sunken-Eyed Girl). Also, the song ""His Truth is Marching On"" is really an interesting and deep song. This person has clearly dealt with some big issues in his life, and the listener will feel the better for sharing it with him. I have listened to the cd really alot and do not tire of it. Well done."
1,Don't waste your money on this junk.,"I bought this for my son (who has put the big Roboraptor on his Christmas List) and regretted it within 15 minutes of getting it home. It barely walks, even on our hard wood floors. It sounds like the whir of cheap gears that it is. It has no real ""personality"" or ""moods"" and is now just collecting dust. My 11 year old got tired of this toy in about 5 minutes. Not even my cats were scared by this thing.Overall, this was a complete and utter waste of money."
2,Uhhhh...,"Well, a few days back, I got this ""robot"" along with mini robosapien. I opened Robosapien first, and excitedly popped in the batteries and turned it on, but all it did was march forward until it crashed into something. Lame. Next, I tried this guy, but he didn't do much more. In a nutshell, he walks in circles, and swivels his head and tail. He can move his arms and open his mouth, but that isn't quite how it sounds. You have to move his arms manually, and opening his mouth requires pushing a button on his chin. it may be fun for a few minutes, but compared to the true Roboraptor, he's just a toy. I'm not calling this a pitiful mess, but I recomend that if you do buy it, you use it as a companion for the big one."
1,Boring,"I got this toy for my 11 year old. He was very excited at first but when playing with it he said it was boring. it doesn't have a remote and ""all it does is walk"" and you can't control where it goes."
1,horrible,DON'T BUY! it barely walks and u have 2 open its mouth by a button and move its arms by hand. i would buy anything but this.
1,not working,"The toy doesn't work at all. broken in many places. legs do not work and falls over.My son was very upset,."
1,To quote my son: Lamest Toy Ever!!,"My son has always wanted roboraptor. I (and Santa) wouldn't buy it for him. so when he saw mini, he said he would buy it out of his own money. I let him. He (and I) thought it would be a smaller version of the larger toy... it isn't. It just eats batteries and moves its feet and turns around in a circle.I think the company should be ashamed for using the name of an expensive and popular toy to fool kids into buying this toy. I bought one to give as a birthday gift at the same time and frankly, I had to return it because I didn't want to set the recipient up for the same disappointment that my own son went through.On the plus side, my son is learning the valuable lesson that no matter how cool toys look on TV, they rarely turn out to be that great in real life. AND... the WOWEE company has ensured that we will not be wasting any more of our money on their very lame toys"
1,Just like Mini Robosapien.,"It walks. No, it does the moon walk. And its spins. And spins. And spins."
2,Kind of a stinker,"I'm a big Fates Warning fan, but this album is certainly not their best work. The tunes are bloated and John Arch, who has a tendency to go a bit over the top, goes way over the top with his vocals on this one. If you want classic Arch-era Fates, stick with Awaken the Guardian."
2,People lie like if their lives depended on it...,"Unbeliavable the rviwe we read here.... Saying this is the best metal album EVER.... .. You must be making a bad, very bad joke...This early effort by Fates Warning is totally lackluster... This Geoff Tate wanna-be singer has an annoying voice. The songs are pedestrian, mediocre at best. And they are not similar AT ALL to Iron Maiden or Judas Priest. I would be glad if they were.... This a a talented band in their beginnings, tryind to do the best metal they could, but this album has absolutely NOTHING special about it."
3,3 stars for finishing,"This book started out really well. It was a brilliant idea and actually the execution wasn't half bad. My complaint about this book is that a lot of it was fluff. Internal musing that were gone over again and again, in much the same way, and half the time I didn't know what part of the book I was in because it sounded all the same.I stopped liking the heroine after a while. She had such immense potential and it was ruined by her being a complete wuss. As for the hero, I commend him for his huge heart, but I was turned off by him for some reason.Even so, there were enough interesting characters in this story to make it fantastic, if the author had just cut the fluff and added more core storyline. I finished the book and I'm not regretting the time I spent on it, but I won't be picking up the second book. Which sucks because I half think that Bridin and Darque's story would be great. I just don't want to risk it turning into another fluff-fest."
3,Ups and Downs,I was hoping for a little more fantasy and a little less romance / sex. Not terrible overall. When the book wasn't in bed it was rather enjoyable.
3,Fairytale,"Good book, however not up to Maggie Shayne's normal writing for it could just be me. Enjoyed but didn't hold my attention like her other books."
4,Great Read!,"What a perfect grown up fairytale...It definitely left me wanting more. I read the whole thing in one day, not so unusual when I have a Maggie Shayne book in my hands. Great read!"
3,Just OK,"I downloaded this (free!) book because the plot seemed like it could have great potential. Unfortunately, the potential was wasted and I found myself bored - yet wanting to know how the story ended. I did something I don't normally do... I skimmed until I found passages that seemed to move the plot along. The first 80% of the story is slow moving. So much of the plot and the characters' feeling are rehashed throughout the book. Then the end/resolution moved along very quickly. This would have been much better as a short story/novella.Overall, I would not recommend this book."
2,Skimmed through most of it,Fairytale (Fairies of Rush)I skimmed through most of this book. Through most of the book we were in Brigit & Adams head as they went over and over and over what the other person was thinking and really doing and how they really felt. When we already knew. What we did know was rehashed and rehashed. Very little of the book was spent progressing the story. Just their endless speculating about the other. Then when we finally got back to the story. The ending was rushed. The book was hard to finish. Anything more than free would have been to much to spend on this book. I would not pay for the sequel.
4,Fantasy Romance,"Brigit was left on the steps of the orphanage as a baby with a handmade book called ""Fairytale"" and a pendant. The nuns told her she was a twin but she could never find proof of a sister. At age nine she ends up living in the streets and eventually earns desparately needed cash but using her amazing ability (magical?) to forge great works of art. She escapes to the straight life when a visitor from the past threatens her into forging a painting owned by Adam. Turns out the painting was painted by the twin and is of a glen in the fairytale world. Adam had stubbled ""across"" as a child and knows the meaning of the picture. It was in the book and so Brigit knows what it means.The book revolves around the growing romanced between the two as they struggle with both evil humans and their own confusion about the meaning of the painting.It's all pretty farfetched but the book is certainly a pleasant enough read. Not a keeper for me though - no tears or belly laughs."
4,Lovely story,"I very much enjoyed this book. It was a whimsical story of love and intrigue. It is a read I would recommend to others. Maggie Shayne delivers a page turner again, as always."
2,Crying Shame,"I own some much better books written by Maggie Shayne; please don't judge the author by this story. I couldn't find the will to finish more than half. Maybe it was written by the author as a pre-teen? If so, it would explain quite a bit. Not worth the time it took to download."
3,Not what I expected,"Songs I never heard before. I read the ratings and that was my reason for purchasing, but was very disappointed."
5,"Well researched, interesting, thought provoking","This book has many quality elements. It is thoroughly researched ensuring the authenticity of the story. At times, the story is quite fascinating making it difficult to put it down. Finally, it is thought provoking by introducing new Civil War era American heroes while making usually subtle, and sometimes not so subtle connections to current politics."
5,Fair Public Administration,Most of the times decision making in public administration is bound by forces that are beyond the public administrator's control. The book lays down sources of external forces and how to handle them in a fair and ethical ways.
3,"Quite a good case, overstated for effect.","An addition to the 'debunking' literature, which offers a contrarian view of business behaviour. It is both entertaining and thought-provoking, but not in the same class as Eileen Shapiro, The Seven Deadly Sins of Business.The theme is that too many businesses have taken their eye off the ball. The critical requirement for success is looking after productivity. Successive chapters look at how corporate accounts conceal what is happening to this fundamental and how resources are wasted in 'incentivized packages', advertising, IT, greenwashing and so on.As is true of all this genre, the author has a case, but oversimplifies it for dramatic effect. But most businesses would benefit from reflecting whether they are committing any of these sins."
4,GREAT RARE OLD TV WITH CHARLES BRONSON,"I had never seen any of these shows before, but I am a huge Charles Bronson fan and had to have it. These shows are in very good shape on the DVDs. The only disappointment is there are no extras. Most of the people associated with making this show I am sure are dead. It is a unique show about a superhero (Charles Bronson) who is a professional photographer named Mike Kovac. It only lasted for two short seasons, but I think it helped launch his movie career. Some of the episodes are like a few movies he did like the one he did with Elvis (Kid Galahad), and the one he did called X-15 with Mary Tyler Moore. I am surprised a show has never been made like this since. It would be harder to do this show now with all the different technology we have today. It would probably not be as interesting."
4,"Pocket American sign language dictionary, purchased at Amazon","This an excellent source of information. It isgreat since it will fit in a pocket and be quickly available.The only problem is that some drawings are toosmall to easily seen. However, a small magnifying glass takes care of this."
5,Thank you for the good product.,Thank you for this dictionary. I sent it to my husband in prison. It is such a help to him. It arrived in good condiction.
5,Intensive Care: The Story of a Nurse,This book is true life. I have been a nurse for many years and have seen so many of the same things. It touched my heart and warmed my soul. Reminded me of myself and why I became a nurse! A must read for all nurses new and seasoned!!
5,awesome book,I'm interested in medicine and this is a great book. Ms. Heron's anecdotes were so amusing. I can't wait to read more of her books.
3,another new history,"A 'New history' in the best tradition of this work of knowledge. Most of the information here is pretty well known and their isn't much revelation. One small issue is the title. The actual title should be 'Two lands, one people' since that is the actual reality today. Their were never actually two peoples in the same land, even in the much maligned and reviled 'Mandate' period.Of course, typically, this book frames the conflict as one between 'Jews and Arabs' when their are many more layers to the fabric of the diverse mosaic that is the holy land. Their were inter-Jewish struggles of Revisionists against Zionists against the Orthodox. And within the Palestinian camp their are equal divisions between the Bedouin, the fundamentalists, the socialists and the effendis. Not to mention the Druze.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,Ilan Pappe rewrites History to fit his own agenda,"Ilan Pappe, has taken the history of israel and changed it to fit his revisionist dialogue and prpomte an anti Israel agenda. He uses information that cannot be documented, has decided on a one state solution and essentially calls for the elimination of the state of Israel, while he lives on a goverment salary, and is protected by the very soliders that he demonizes. He should be filed un ""fiction"" in the libraries."
1,Historical fiction,"This simply isn't history. In real life, people do things for reasons. Historians explain what happened and (to some extent) why. That is how they are able to infer as yet unknown details and even predict future attitudes and acts. Pappe gets plenty of facts wrong, but his biggest failing is to ascribe incorrect or even impossible motives to many of the people of the region.This book is propaganda masquerading as history."
2,Regardless Customer Services From Beach Audio,"First, the e-mail message I sent about the urgency of my delivery was left responseless and they acted on their on convenience.Second, in the picture you see two cartridges + two spare heads however there were only two cartridges inside the box and that was it.Will never buy anything from beach audio ever again."
1,Sensationalism at its worst,This book was written by a person that was unhappy before and after her surgery. Don't buy this book.
2,birds don't like it,"We have 3 feeders in our backyard, this feeder is always full. The other two will be empty within a couple days, and the birds will only eat from this if it is the only option. Not sure what they do not like."
3,Not entirely squirrel proof,"Squirrels quickly learn to brace themselves against the lip of the tray. As suggested,you can invert the seed tray but my squirrels still find a way to hang on and can feed for a few minutes at a time."
3,"shouldn't be called ""squirrel-proof""","The red squirrels eat their fill as the birds wait...Many red squirrels do not weigh enough, so if you have them, expect to feed them also as they are very persistent! Not worth the cost since the feeder is not really squirrel proof and that is primarily what I was hoping for..."
4,Well made feeder.,"The birds don't like it as much as my ""Yankee flipper"" but it is well made and the birds probably will get used to it."
4,birdfeeder review,"I purchased several different bird feeders at the same time from Amazon. This is my favorite feeder. I rated it only 4 stars because the screw on the bottom falls off and the platform base keeps falling off. Already lost original screw. The birds seem to really like it (main objective). Wish the top wasn't flat because it gets bird poop all over it. All in all, very pleased."
2,"Item was just a paperback book; no dice, or miniatures","Ensure you are getting the complete game, not just the book.It's not the seller's fault.The compete game is out there."
1,"prentice mulford's story, life by land and sea",well i opened the book to read it and page six was blank. bad print job? i would like a replacement
5,Not typical hair metal - undiscovered masterpiece,"So alot of people including myself didn't take LB very seriously but this album is completely stunning! Excellent songwriting and a level of maturity and intelligence that's very addictive. ""Sins of The Flesh"", ""Phantoms"", ""Never Too Young"", and title track are standout. This was supposed to be a solo album I learned later on. If LB is reading this, bravo to you! Do another like this and show the world!"
3,Completely Different From Lizzy's Prior Releases,"I remember buying this when it first came out almost ten years ago. I can't say that I was even disappointed by the change in musical direction. Master of Disguise is actually pretty good, and was an improvement over Visual Lies really. You could really tell some work had been put into this album. It still had good guitar playing, alongside the orchestration and melody. ""Never Too Young"" was a good ballad with some good singing from Lizzy. ""Phantoms"" would have to be the best track. That's a really good song with great vocals. This album of course was fell through the cracks and was overlooked in my opinion. This album and Menace to Society are Lizzy's best offerings. Menace to Society is the heaviest, and this one is his most progressive. Good album."
4,"Great Album, But Don't Buy It Again.......","I bought this when it originally came out years ago, and it's a super cd, Lizzy's best! Seeing this new version with bonus tracks made my mouth water, so I picked it up as well. The new tracks are horrible, but the packaging and booklet are decent. So...if you already have this CD, rate this new version **2 Stars** out of 5. If you don't, then go ahead and pick this up."
4,ANOTHER METAL OF THE 80s,"Another 80's metal! Lots of good metal stuff here! Go get it! Some of the songs are: Master of disguise, One false move, Live is a crime, Sins of the flesh and many more."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The dvd surround sound works great, but using it as a receiver does not work at all for me. When I hook up the vcr or any other device like a playstation the surround sound does not work. I only plays through the front left and right channels. I'm going to return it."
2,Don't make my mistake...,"If you're looking at this item, chances are you've got a cabinet-full of VHS movies, and you've decided to jump to DVDs. So with this you can enjoy your VHS movies in surround sound, and start collecting DVDs, right? NOT WITH THIS SYSTEM!Turns out that, although you can hook up a high-fi VCR to this system, it does not have the ability to decode the surround-sound encoding on the tapes (Dolby Pro Logic, dts) and play it through all six speakers. ... I ended up sending this back and buying a component system which allows me to enjoy surround sound on all my media. (I also ended up spending [$$$], too, which was more than I wanted!)This system is compact, simple, elegant, and it sounds pretty good. It just didn't do what I expected it to do. Because detailed specs on this system seem to be really hard to come by, I thought this comment might help those of you who were as confused as me!Good luck!"
1,A Real Let Down,"I own 2 other Apex DVD players. They are great. This Home Theater System isn't. The remote enters the number 4 repeatedly when it's just sitting on the table. It has gone through 4 sets of batteries in 2 months. The main unit doesn't recognize commands from it 3/4 of the time. It won't play SVCD discs as it's manual says it will. Overall, I'd say it's a piece of garbage. I don't know what happened to the good quality for a low price Apex used to deliver, but this sure isn't it!"
5,The best there is!,"I have the Apex HT-100W Home theater System and it works great! The people above are complaining about surround sound support when the most likely didn't set it up correctly. The surround sound output or digital audio out put has to first be enabled through an onscreen menu before you hook the devices up. If you check the manual it provides easy instructions on how to do so. I have always loved Apex and use them for all my electronic needs, from TV's to DVD players. I am about to buy another for my bedroom and look at the price of this thing! I would pay big money for it and think it was a good deal! Buy this product!"
1,Do not buy it!,This was the first surround sound system that I have bought. I was horrified when i got it set up and realized that the surround sound only worked for the DVD player. It sounds great for DVD's but everything else comes out of two front speakers. ... APEX has made a big mistake with this product and they sure had me fooled and I quickly returned it ...Don't make the same mistake that I did.
1,Apex is junk!,"Apex Digital products often fail within the first year. They have horrible customer service, false advertising, and fail to honor their warranties. Please check www.labbb.gov (Better Business Bureau) and search for Apex Digital to see the F rating the better business bureau has given them. Saving 10-15 dollars is not worth the hassle they cause."
2,enjoyed it while it lasted,"We bought the HT-100W last Thanksgiving. This was our first experience with home theater. The price was great and we were very happy with its performance, for the most part. It could have been louder, but that was usually not a problem. Unfortunately, it died about 10 months after we bought it. I am thinking that in the future, I will keep away from integrated DVD players."
1,Do not buy this item,My roommate and I bought this item and found out that it doesn't support VCD. How can a home theater product in the year 2003 not support the most popular form of video entertainment. This is just garbage.
5,Best detective novel ever written,"I bought this book some years ago because I liked the picture of the bulldog on the cover. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. C.W. Sughrue's El Camino speeds through the West--from Montano to California, then back again--like a bat out of hell, searching for a safe harbor. He finds it, at last, 'where he hangs his hangover.' Every now and then I run into someone who has read Crumley, and we wind up reciting lines from 'Dancing Bear' and 'The Mexican Tree Duck' for hours. I once read that Rolling Stone said 'The Last Good Kiss' is the last good hard-boiled fiction, and I truly agree."
3,OK,"Northern California post-hippie detective noir (is that a genre?). The main character's a dard-drinking Vietnam vet private detective who's been hired to track down a hard-drinking World War II vet who happens to write pulp novels and Nobel Prize winning poetry - on the 15 days of the year he manages to stay sober. He locates his prey on page one, dead drunk in a bar near Oakland. Alas, they become fast friends while our hero isinvestigating a second case. A beautiful, talented teenager went missing 12 years ago and her momma wants to find her. They hunt far and wide, finally turning up a death certificate. The poet has a young wife, an ex-wife and a mother (also a novelist) who all live on his estate in Montana. Some rough stuff happens. Even more drinking and cursing and whoring happens. And we are brought to our, er, conclusion. A happy little book, which, like its hero, succeeds in spite of it not caring what you may think of it."
3,I bought this for my Reading Group,"The author writes well but I didn't particularly like the story or the characters, who were all sleazy, vulgar people. My favorite character in the book was the beer drinking Bulldog. Like most dogs, he was loyal and sensible, which the human characters were nots. were not. It is a good book for a discussion group but I don't think I will read anything more by this author."
2,Don't expect to be reading it tonight.,"I ordered ""The Last Good Kiss"" on 9/20/08. The author had recently died. It was indicated to be in stock when I ordered. It is now 10/24/08. I do not have the book yet! You know what I think of the servioce."
3,meandering read,"After reading the glowing reviews, I thought I would be in for a mesmerizing journey. Sorry to say, I would only classify it as meandering. The hardboiled protagonist is witty, but his manner is laconic and there is little forward thrust to the story. Yes, there are some 'surprises' and suspense, but the rhythm is (no doubt purposely) bruisingly slow. One can sense the intelligence and dilligence in the author's efforts, but the book, as a whole, was not compelling."
2,"James Crumley, an Acquired Taste","As a wise reviewer has observed, one does not read Crumley for his plots. On the other hand, his language and insight into our deepest angst trumps any failings with the plot (which in The Last Good Kiss, surely stymied this intrepid reader!). His sense of place, musings on why we do what we do are marvelous and, importantly, when is the last time you laughed out loud many times during a reading!! Tom Knight"
4,LAST CHAPTER NEARLY RUINED THE BOOK FOR ME (spoilers ahead),"James Crumley's classic THE LAST GOOD KISS had me pretty riveted from start to (almost) finish, but the controversial final chapter really put me off, and left me a bit unclear as to the character's motivations for doing what they did.Can someone explain to me why Trehearne and his first wife would kill Betty Sue when she was already leaving of her own accord? Was it because, even though she was willing to pay for her to leave, Catherine (wife #1) was so jealous of Betty Sue that she wanted her dead? Was it because of Trehearne's line ""I know that I can't live without her""? The grim denouement of the story really came out of nowhere for me. And though I'm a huge fan of noir, not to mention dark endings to dark stories (CHINATOWN is an all-time favorite), here it felt wrong.Any opinions, thoughts, or theories would be welcomed."
5,Epic detective novel,"The Last Good Kiss starts off slowly with a mildly interesting task for our hero, but soon the novel spills over into a booze-soaked road novel with intrigue, seduction and double-crosses. A must on any bookshelf."
3,Hunter Thompson as a private investigator,"After I read interviews with two of my favorite crime fiction authors (Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly) who both said that this book was excellent hardboiled crime fiction and a major influence on their work, I had to find a copy and read for myself. It's quirky and unusual, and it's not your stereotypical hardboiled crime ripoff by an author trying to copy Raymond Chandler, but I didn't impress me that much.Maybe if I had never read Hunter Thompson, the godfather of gonzo journalism, I would have been more impressed. But after reading this, what I was left with was the feeling that Crumley had taken Hunter Thompson's style and bizarro characters and plugged them into a crime novel. Interesting, but not as groundbreaking as I was expecting after hearing Lehane and Connelly rave about this guy.One Crumley novel was OK, but I have no compulsion to seek out more."
4,changing pad cover,"Very good quality changing pad cover. We have a flat changing pad, and it's difficult to find covers to fit it. This one works well, although it's not elasticized all the way around. The cotton is good quality, though, and the selection of colors is excellent."
4,"Good product so far, but not as good for thin flat mattresses",So far so good. Washed once to make sure all chemicals are out and no tearing up. It is very tight so it makes thinner flat mattresses bow up a little.
2,yes it is cheap for a reason,"i figured this is something you can go cheap on. how hard is it to make a decent changing pad cover?! this is poor quality terry, too small for the pad, and already has a hole in the seam after 2 washes."
4,Do not dry!,"I washed and dried the cover as soon as I got it and now it doesn't really fit the way it should. Otherwise, it is a good color and it will do the job."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to find a changing pad cover for $10, but I will be returning this item. The material is SO THIN! It's a tad small for a standard size, contoured changing pad so it comes up a bit on the sides which looks very ugly. The purple is a dull lavender, I was hoping it would be a little more vibrant in color. The color I could overlook, but it's so thin and small that there's no point in having it. With a coupon I can get a yard of nice minky fabric in the color I want for less than $10 and make my own nice thick minky dot changing pad cover. Even if you're not handy with sewing though, it's worth it to spend a little more and get something worth having. Don't waste your time or money on this item."
3,good price,This item was very pretty but did crush the corners of my changing pad. I switched to a non-fitted cover.
3,Sort of works....,"It is flat and it is hard to find a flat cover, but it seems to be about 2 inches too small in the width. The fabric is soft an the color is nice though."
4,Bought Two,"We bought two of these and am glad we did. We have a flat changing table, and most of the covers seem to be for curved ones. I didn't think I could find my color, but this company did have a purple option. Score! These wash pretty well, and if I were better with the stain stick I'm sure they would remain spotless (mine are not). Glad we have two so there's always something covering the table regardless of how big a mess we made on the last change."
3,"Does the job, but not the best quality","This is the only cover I could find to fit my thin changing table pad. So what I like the most is that it actually fits! I also like the color. It's a nice, deep red. But it is very thin and started to pill after 1 wash. Not the best quality, but does the job."
4,A Good Deal,"I'm glad to see SOME baby items in bold colors. After all- high contrast is what newborns can actually detect! This fits on a standard changing table pad fairly well, and the material is fine. It's a good deal for the price."
2,okay,"This changing table cover was okay. After first wash, it was still okay. Then after consecutive washes, the seams began falling apart. Maybe it was just mine, not so sure. I only have one changing table cover, when soiled, I use the larger/rectangular receiving blankets."
2,Doesn't fit standard size changing pad,"I bought this changing pad cover because it was really affordable. However, I did not read the description closely enough where it states 'flat changing table cover'. I have a Summer Infant changing pad that is the standard shape and size and this cover did not fit - it is way too small to cover the pad. Make sure when you purchase this you have a FLAT changing pad."
2,Not impressed,"Purchased this item for a Serta contour changing pad and it wasn't until it was on the changing pad that I realized it didn't fit correctly because it wasn't made for a contoured changing pad. I guess I didn't fully read the description so the ill fit wasn't that big of a deal. However, the material seems kind of cheap and the terry tends to pick if you catch velcro - from a diaper tab or swaddle blanket - on it. Overall I like the Carter's and Babies R Us brand changing pad covers much better - the better quality is worth the few extra dollars. I would not purchase this item again, even if it did fit the Serta changing pad."
3,A Book as Dense as Taxes Themselves,"Schnepper's book is not without its nuggets of ideas. However, to lead the reader to believe he or she will pay zero taxes is a bit misleading. This book is much too wordy and dense for the average reader. It's best to give it to your tax advisor and let them sort through the material. Schnepper devotes much of the book to case law, which is of more interest to tax attorneys than general consumers. Particularly frustrating is that the index must be from previous editions of the book. As I tried to reference various topics, the pages cited were not where the information I needed was. In short, this book is not particularly user-friendly and excessive attention was devoted to random topics."
3,Somewhat Helpful But Misses the More Important Point,"A really good tax book would tell you how complicated and unfair the current system really is. It would tell you that the current system costs Americans hundreds of billions of dollars annually in man hours for compliance and makes a parasitic class of politicians, lobbyists, lawyers and tax accountants quite rich. It is no wonder that books like this don't tell you any of that then is it? Instead of jumping through all kinds of hoops and frantically arranging your affairs to suit the taxing authorities why don't we demand a simplified system that puts all of these leaches out of work and puts our wealth to work creating jobs that make working people better off?A book like this may be useful under the current system, but, there is the danger that it will keep you so busy chasing deductions and exemptions that you will forget what the real problem is."
3,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"HOW TO PAY ZERO TAXES - YOUR GUIDE TO EVERY TAX BREAK THE IRS ALLOWS.NOT A BAD BOOK IF YOU WANT UNDERSTANDABLE SUMMARIES OF AVAILABLE TAX BREAKS BUT THE TITLE IS FRAUDULENT. AN HONEST TITLE WOULD BE ""HOW TO PAY LOWER TAXES"".AS FOR INCLUDING EVERY TAX BREAK THE IRS ALLOWS, NO WAY MR. JEFF. THIS STATEMENT IS A LIE.

2,Not the best sf/fantasy I've ever read.,"I found a used copy of an early 80s printing of Captive of Gor. I had not read any of the previous Gor novels, but my father used to read them when I was young. Since this was all I had, I started in on volume 7 without having read any of the previous volumes. Although I probably would have had a better appreciation of the context if I had started with volume 1, that was not necessary to be able to understand the story.I'll admit it, I bought this book because the version I have has a very sexy cover. And yes this book is kind of a guilty pleasure for me in the sexual and anti-feminist aspects of it. But frankly this is just bad writing. The story is ok. The wold is well-developed. The protagonist is someone you love to hate. The book is just badly written. The author keeps repeating himself and coud have probably cut the length of this book to 1/3. WIth that in mind I will cut short my review before I start repeating myself."
1,Not my type of fiction.,"I haven't read it. Based on reading another book in the series, I probably won't read it. The writer is hateful toward women, and writes long demeaning sex scenes where the woman is called an ""animal"" and Gorean men are glorius."
2,"same old, same old","Yes, folks, it's yet another over-hyped gravelly-voiced singer-songwriter from Texas. (Boy, those Brits will fall for anything with a twang nowadays) You've all heard this stuff before from countless other coffeehouse troubadours. There are a few interesting production touches to break the monotony here, but nothing can keep Klein's grating yowl from getting on your nerves. Somebody get this boy a lozenge!"
2,Caught Hanging,"Let me first say this book was the worst edited novel I've ever read!!Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest, let's get to the plot of Nevada York's Caught Up. The story revolves around best friends Mahogany and Shanice, childhood chums who have been thick and thin together. Now as college-aged adults, they're dealing with such issues as love, fidelity (or lack thereof), bisexualty, marriage, and parenthood. The novel then ties in a web of intrigue wherein Mahogany is being stalked.The plot could have been decent, but overall it was just cheesy. Read for yourself, though ... maybe you like cheese."
5,Natalie Wood is the star of this picture.,This is one of Natalie Woods best early pictures...she was a great actress. It really is sad that her life was cut short by whoever or whatever caused it.
3,Driftwood 1947 movie,"There was a movie called Driftwood on TV, but it had the wrong reveiw. It had the one for this movie a 1947 black and white that is just a good movie. That caused me to try and find it. It has an interesting storyline and you can tell it was made in the 40's. There weren't all of the regulations and the Doctor had a lab on his enclosed porch. The acting was OK and Natalie Wood was good in it. If you have a free evening it is a good nostalgic look back."
4,Near Flawless,"i have listened to George Michael since Wham, and have always been a fan. My main reason for buying this album was the song flawless, which happens to be my favorite song from this album. I think this song can sum it up for anyone who feels down about where they are and seem to be going in life."
4,Does George Michael even understand the themes of his songs?,"The music is very fresh his voice is nearly perfect, but you have to have an iq of over 200 or peronally know this man to understand what he is talking about. Amazing is about Jesus I got that. Then one song is about his uncle. Then their is a song about the world coming to and end and he is just on drugs. Then there is a song about sex, then there is a song about his boyfriend. Then there are two songs aimed to capture a gay club scene thing. At the end of this thing I'm thinking man this is kind of cool but i'm no sexual freeek. You got to admit his videos kick ass and their almost as funny as eminems. I think overall this is probably his best album ever."
4,Awesome Album!!!!,"First of all, it is great to hear some good pop music, finally! I am am extremely impressed with this album. Usually, when you purchase a pop album there might be one or two good songs, but on this album there are several great songs. My three favorites are ""Amazing"", ""Flawless"", and ""Precious Box."" I am pleased to hear some good songwriting and that fact that every song is so personal is nice as well. Good job George!!"
4,Pop Culture Icon,I have had a crush on George Michael since middle school. I have grown to respect him as a singer. He is a great singer and has the hardest working butt in show business {and I mean that with the greatest respect}This is a very solid CD with good songs. I just wish that he would not wait as long between CDs.
3,"not bad, but not great","Throughout the album, there are hints of the old George Michael, most notably Freeek!, which reminded me of a mix between Monkey and Too Funky. Other than that song, if you listen closely to his vocals, it seems like he has lost a few notes in his voice, like he's struggling to sing. Not to say that he's a bad singer because strangely his voice is awesome when he sings live! I just wish he would add more of the soul/r&b inspired songs that really bring out his true vocals."
3,Another solid effort from Michael,"Michael's fourth full-length solo recording (and he's back on Sony!), eight years in the making, is fortunately another solid and respectable release. PATIENCE contains another set of lovely and personal ballads, the best of which being ""John and Elvis are Dead,"" ""My Mother Had a Brother,"" and ""American Angel,"" all of which set among Michael's best work. This album also marks Michael's return to thumping dance music, which proves to be somewhat of a mixed bag. The uplifting ""Amazing"" (#5 UK) is Michael's best dance song since 1996's ""Fastlove,"" however, the remaining sample-heavy techno tracks are uneven. The super-sexy ""Freeek!"" (#7 UK) manages to put a fresh spin on the sample from ""Try Again,"" but ""Flawless"" and ""Shoot the Dog"" (#12 UK) are nothing but rehashed versions of past hits by other artists. Still, PATIENCE is a well-crafted and tuneful recording overall, and it's easily one of 2004's best pop albums. Not essential, but quite good."
4,Where are all the reviews??,"Apparently everyone wrote a review for the IMPORT version of ""Patience""....I KNEW I should have gotten the import!! Anyways, this album is great! The man has one of THE best voices in pop music ever. His voice is so clear and pure that it's an injustice to not listen to him sing. Standout songs for me on this album are ""Patience"", ""Amazing"", ""John and Elvis are Dead"", ""Cars and Trains"", ""Flawless"", and ""Freek"". But THE best song has got to be ""My Mother Had a Brother"". Oh my word...He was singing that song!! ""Through"" is another huge highlight showcasing George's vocal talents and the emotion he puts in a song. Well, be sure to check this album out. Maybe with enough sales George Michael will think about touring in the US again! :)"
5,THE MAN IS BACK,"MY WIFE AND I ARE G.M. FANS. I BELIEVE HIS BEST WORK CAME WHEN HE WAS ALONE, IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT HE WASN'T GREAT IN WHAM, BUT HE TRUELY SHINED ALONE. THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM IF YOU'RE A G.M. FAN. IF I HAD TO CATOGARIZE HIS ALBUMS THEY WOULD GO AS FOLLOW: FAITH, OLDER, PATIENCE, AND THEN LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE. THE SONG AMAZING IS AN AMAZING FIRST SINGLE.THE FAST SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE GREAT (PRECIOUS BOX, FLAWLESS, CARS AND TRAINS, FREEK 04). THE SLOWER SONGS ARE VERY GOOD (PATIENCE, MY MOTHER HAD A BROTHER, PLEASE SEND ME SOMEONE, ROUND HERE). LEAST FAVORITES (JOHN & ELVIS ARE DEAD, AMERICAN ANGEL, THROUGH). AS A HUGE FAN OF G.M. I SUGGEST YOU PICK UP OLDER, WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE A CLASSIC. IF YOU WANT TO GET AN ALL AROUND TASTE OR FEEL OF G.M. PICK UP HIS BEST OF LADIES AND GENTELMEN. YOU WON'T GO WRONG!"
5,Get the import version,"This album was worth the long wait. But I recommend getting the import version. The U.S. version is missing two songs - Patience Part 2 and Shoot the Dog. Since Shoot the Dog criticizes George Bush, it makes you wonder why it is missing in the U.S. version. Can you say CENSORSHIP."
5,Incredible,"Briefly, wow has George Michael grown.. from his Wham days to now he has only shown us again and again his ability to change, adapt and give us more and more of himself with each outing. His voice has matured immeasurably from the early years. As far as those who say that he is only giving us mellow slow song, witness the true George Michael in his post-Wham days.. Listen Without Prejudice was his first true heartfelt work.. showcasing his talents as singer/songwriter. But with this new work he has left behind the self deprecatory themes of albums past and moved on to higher ground. Just sit back, listen and enjoy.. along with Seal IV, two of the best outings in recent memory..."
5,Would Have Waited Another Eight Years...,for the pop music genious George Michael. Excellent composed music with beautifully written lyrics.
2,"If Patience is A Virtue, Colour Me Discomposed","In his first CD of originals since 1996s listless 'Older', we find George Michael reading through his journals - he's happily in love with his Texas beau, he mourns the suicide of his gay uncle at an unfortunate time in gay-history, and he appears to have passed the humiliation of that little Will Rogers Memorial Park men's room incident. While we are happy for his love life [and we could assume he'll be okay after his recent drug arrest] and to just hear him croon again, we could have - should have - expected anything more current sounding than the cornball confessionals, drippy ballads and narcoleptic mid-tempo dance ditties he's pumped out for almost 2 decades. Welcome to the millennium, George. Long live 1987. My grade: C+"
4,George is back and worth it!,"I am not going to say much except that this is a great blend of uptempo songs (AMAZING, FLAWLESS) and great ballads (JOHN AND ELVIS ARE DEAD, THROUGH).....it blends his 80's sound with his modern day more introspective type material and succeeds.......my only complaint is I wish he had included a few more uptempo tracks and less ballads.....he really works his voice when it is in a dance type setting....sexy!!!!"
2,patience george michael,"It is not going to bring George Michael back to American airwaves, but there are many great artist of the past and present that do not get their fair share of airplay. It is still an album of true to the heart songs that describe this artist's struggles. To me, lyrics sometimes out weigh the hooks that the general population listen for..."
2,Saving the worst for last,"""Patience"" is a pathetic attempt by George Michael to put an album together. While his voice is still as amazing as ever, the songs in this album range from dismal (as in the case of ""Patience"") to mundane (as in the case of ""John and Elvis as dead""). As a huge George Michael fan, I am truly disappointed with this album. It is evident by these songs that George Michael has lost touch with reality. George Michael has forgotten that he is, first and foremost, an entertainer and not a politician or a social activist. As a result, he has completely lost the inspiration that lead him to write amazing lyrics throughout his career. My advice: don't waste your money on this ""album."""
1,AWFUL!!!!,"From the liner notes, George states that this album took 5 years to complete. I think they should have put another 5 more into it. The songs are boring, they go nowhere, and the music never really gels into anything cohesive or coherent. I feel like I'm listening to the past 10 years of his therapy sessions. And they are as BORING as hell."
1,I was mislead!!!,"This review is late, but I had to put it out there. After waiting so, so, so long for new George Michael, I was very disappointed. I read all the reviews, got hyped up and pre-ordered the CD. I didn't like it. I didn't expect him to pick up right where he left off but PATIENCE was a total 360. I didn't like it. Don't think I even finished listening to the enitre thing. I decided to include my review simply because I purchased it on the strength of other reviews. I love George Michael and am always in his corner, but I couldn't get behind Patience."
1,Patience with fans nerves...................,"George Michael didn't put his best foot forward on this album,yet it reminds me of how much he thinks he trying to give his fans something worthwhile. We all are mostly disappointed in this half-hearted effort from a very talented man,George stop relaxing and get to work. Avoid this album if possible."
1,disappointing comeback,"i ran out to buy this cd after having heard the single ""amazing"" which i immediately fell in love with and expected to hear more great songs on george michael's comeback album. boy, was i disappointed! ""patience"" is an apt title for this cd because you're going to need alot of it to get through these songs. after ""amazing"" it's downhill all the way. i listened to the cd all the way through twice and was still unable to single out one other song that was in any was memorable or stood out among all the others. they all blended into a big boring mess! getting through this cd was an effort and i'll probably never listen to it again. of course, george michael's voice is still the same wonderful instrument it always was, but unfortunately it's not enough to carry this dreary assortment of songs.i want the old george michael back."
2,"Great voice, but where's the rhythm?","I've been a pretty loyal fan of George, but this album, well, it lacks the groove of his other work. Amazing is okay, but Shoot the Dog and Freek are the best...still, he lost his zip. Listen without Prejudice was far better...better beats, better vocals, better groove. I 'm very disappointed....don't spend $ on the import."
2,Listened w/out Prejudice - Didn't like it.,"I agree with other reviews regarding this CD and how it's a bit disappointing. I think if you're a real huge GM fan, including his ballads and singing approach, you'll probably dig this album. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a full CD of songs like Flawless (Go to the City), you'll be HUGELY disappointed. (BTW, a group called The Ones are responsible for the music behind that song - go find their CD if you want a ""flawless"" purchase...heh.) Anyways, aside from that song, the only other song that comes close to it is Amazing, and even that pales in comparison. Listen to an Internet stream from m1live.com - they play a mixed version of Amazing that puts some life into it... but I digress...if you want dance/upbeat, look elsewhere. If you're a diehard fan, chances are you'll be satisfied with this one. In all cases though, don't compare this to his other stuff...from another time, my friends..."
3,A So So Comeback,"In the past George Michael has had some truly wonderful CD's, inventive, daring, funky, inspirational, but this CD I am sad to say has fallen a little short.The best songs on this CD are ""Amazing"" (classic George, popish and fun with a grabbing beat), ""Round Here"" (jazzy and cool), ""Shoot the Dog"" (club mix that will make you get up and dance), ""My Mother Had A Brother"" (a nice slow anthem to Gay life), and ""Flawless"" (another runway model dance mix).Most of the remaining songs are far too slow or have haphazard musical arrangements. I miss the old George with his jazz and funk influences. This CD is likable but not a classic like ""Faith"" and it lacks the daring inventiveness of ""Older"". I hope George Michael tries again soon with a little more heart."
4,Quite enjoyable!,"I borrowed my mothers copy of the cd, to see if i'd like it, and so far i'm enjoying the songs. I agree with one of the reviews that more upbeat songs would be welcome, as those songs really work well for him. The ballads are nice, but the faster tunes are great in the car....:)"
5,Grammy Folks Don't Miss This One!!!,"Patience is just BRILLIANT!!! The songs,the singing, production,and overall styling of the music. Keep it up ""George"" we allneed the truth coming out of artists lives right now. If you needan opening act just email me.Love To All Great Artists,Jean McClain(Pepper Mashay)"
2,Boring George - But I Still Have Faith,"This is arguably George Michael's most personal offering to date where he sings of love (American Angel), the Past (Round Here) and death (Mother Had A Brother)...All tracks that tick along quite nicely. But that is the problem. For an artist so talented, he really needs to be pushing boundaries and not producing background lounge music !! He lifts the pace somewhat with the best track 'Amazing', 'Flawless' - with it's pumping disco beat, and the political 'Shoot The Dog' (not available on all CD's as the song was pulled off the American version)..But it is not enough to recover the uneventfulness of this collection...What you do get for your money is at max 4 decent tracks, George's beautiful voice and perfect production...not sure if that is enough to pay the asking price!"
2,Not creative enough,"The world knows that George Michael is one of the best songwritters of this age and he has proved that to us since Wham! up until his ""Greatest Hits"" compilation. This album missed the greatness of his work. Only a few tracks stand out such as ""Amazing"" ,""Flawless (Go to the City)"", and ""Freeek '04."" Others are just too dry and boring. This album took too long to make and the whole sound is not integrated. This album is a disappointment."
5,I forgot I loved him,"I saw George perform Amazing on Oprah. The song stuck with me which hasn't happened in a long time.It has been a long time but now I remember why I loved George in the 80's. This album makes you feel. It is not just a POP album. If you can listen to this album and not like Amazing, Precious box and my mother's brother you are crazy. This is a happy and sad CD. I love it. I think its amazing."
5,Worth the wait,"This album is fantastic. I am a fan since the Wham days, and this album does not disappoint. Even friends that are not into him have said that the songs are great and that his voice sounds AMAZING. Welcome back, George! If we could now just convince him to not stop making albums!!!! Btw, saw him on Oprah and have to say that he is a real sweetheart. It is refreshing to see a celeb that is so open and honest."
3,"OK, but not stunning","While George Michael has a great voice and has some good selections on this particular album, PATIENCE, this is not really stunning material as say his earlier stuff with his monumental FAITH album. The music, production, and arrangement in which George is in charge of are all solid. Being a musician myself, It is admirable when the performer writes, produces, and performs all of his material, and for that I give Michael props. My favorite ""listens"" on PATIENCE are ""AMAZING"", ""JOHN AND ELVIS ARE DEAD"", ""CARS AND TRAINS"", and ""FREEEK '04"". A heads up to parents, this album is in unedited format and particularly the song ""FREEEK '04"" contains what should be considered as unsuitable sexual, stong language material for younger kids. Anyways, those are the best tracks and the music is phenomenal. But, this album otherwise is average, especially the title track, ""PATIENCE"". 3 stars."
5,Still one of the best male voices,"Wow..Ive been waiting for a new album!!! This man is blessed with one of the most soulful and dynamic voices anywhere. The more I hear this album, the more I love it. Thanks George!!!!"
3,IMPORT HAS 2 MORE SONGS,"Might as well order the import for a few bucks more, you're getting two more songs and its the full album George made and released around the world, except for the US. It makes no sense to me why this US release got short changed. 5 stars for the import complete album. The US version loses 2 stars for 2 less tracks."
3,"Great moments, average album","Basically agree with the reviewer from Tennessee. Amazing, Precious Box and Round Here are all right up there with George's best, but the rest is a bit of a bore, without much melody and with too many words. By far the weakest of George's solo CDs. I listened to Faith again having heard this and I realised how excellent it was, even more so compared with Patience."
4,If you've missed George Michael you won't be disappointed,"Yes, if you've simply missed just hearing George Michael's unmistakable voice, you will enjoy this CD. It's what you would expect from him and as a fan, that was all I needed to know. Some ballads, some soul searching, some interesting lyrics and something to get you moving. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he makes a sexy video out of ""Flawless"" that can be blasted across the screens at my favorite alternative clubs. It's good to hear him again."
5,His Best,"I have loved George Michael for a long time. Hearing this was his last CD made me have very high hopes for it. It did not dissapoint. The CD is a variety of fast beats, slow ballads & even a gay enthem thrown in. It is very perfect. The writing on the album is amazing, and the music is great. George's voice is still the best voice in the music industry."
4,"Worth being ""patient"" for","I have always been a George Michael fan even in WHAM! (hey, I was a teenager!) With every release he just keeps getting better. The only problem is he only makes new music every 10 years!! This is well worth the wait though. It really is a great cd both musically and lyrically. One of the standout songs is ""My Mother had a Brother"". I liked it when i first heard it, then really listened to the lyrics. It really is a great song and very sad, and being a gay man, I can really relate to the lyrics. I can go on and on about each song, but they are all good, except for maybe 2. I just wish the States would appreciate him more(...)."
2,It Takes a lot of Patience to sit through this,"Been looking forward to George's new album for years. While the fast tracks are decent and competent, I expected more from his slower tracks (which used to be his forte). George Michael in an interview once said his goal was to write songs which would ""Stand the test of time"" - but in this case I doubt it. Ballads are meandering, overlong and almost tuneless, compounded by the sin of trying to squeeze in sententious and pretentious lyrics into a melodic line."
2,Just Ok,Save your money and download the two best songs from this cd. Amazing and Flawless. The rest is all garbage. I dont like any of the slow songs. I think he could do better. Sorry George Faith will always be your best.
2,ok at best,"George Michael is a very Talented singer,songwriter,arranger&Producer but on this album He is settling for run of the Mill Material.there a couple decent tracks here but alot of the Material seems&feel dated&lacking any substance to measure up to what he use to do."
3,Good But Not Quite Great!!,"Upon The Release of This Album I Was Excited That Something New From Him Was Out And Available For The Fans!! Hearing It Though Was a Little Disapointing. I Would Have Thought That with him Being More Mature His Stuff would Be Happier But It is not. I Find The Album Kinda Slow Going And Not Real Upbeat .A Few Songs are good But I find it To be to slow mostly.if you want dance music , this is not the album for you."
2,George is obviously out of ideas,"After 1 listen it was clear that not even 1 of the 14 songs is as good as anything on Listen Without Prejudice. I don't have any desire to listen a second time. I was really looking forward to hearing this one too. It's not even nearly as good as Older, which also was weak compared to LWP, in my opinion."
2,Not the best I heard,"I will more than likely see messages shooting down my review, however, this is not the best cd from george michael. Fortunately, I did not pay for this. There was only one song that I actually liked and that is Round Here. The rest just didn't measure. Even the music to rock your body to proved to be 'empty'. Sorry, George but I will continue to stick with 'Listen Without Prejudice'. It's really the best you've done. The sad part is this is cd that caused you so much distress with the music industry."
2,Dissapoinment - because of BLAND MELODIES,"Although a personal album, beautiful lyrically, and beautiful in its careful and perfectionist production and arrangements, the melodies lack originality and are catchy in a forgettable and bland way. Most of them are reminiscent of other songs. Nothing is impressive or fresh, unlike in Listen Without Prejudice and Older. I know that many songwriters loose their songwriting spark after a while. George Michael has definitely lost it."
1,No patience...BAD,This CD should be named after the MJ classic Bad! The only thing about that statement is that it is true!
1,Pass the toilet paper,"This Greek Goddess needs to cruise new rest areas for fresh ideas! It's starting to stink the CD player. The singles that did not fair so well on the charts and went by US soil unnoticed, even by the DJ's (remixes were bad too!), GM should take some more time off and come back with his best!. Or maybe we have seen his best and there's no way up for him. I'm sure he will do well in Europe, because Europeans are familiar with Eurotrash. So what ever possesed him to write an uninteresting song about Elvis and John?"
1,IT SUCKS!,"This is one of the worst cds I have ever bought, it was not worth $12.99. Infact it doesn't even deserve 1 star. I am waring you, DON'T BUY THIS!"
3,Nutrine Garlic Shampoo,"My hair type is fine to medium thickness. It is wavy and very dry. My scalp is dry as well. This product did not help with hair fallout as recommended to me elsewhere. Hair fallout was about the same; however I noticed the quality (texture, shine, color) of my hair was slightly diminished."
2,didnt stop the shedding,"i brought this shampoo after i read the reviews online and on amazon i have been using this product a little bit longer than 6 weeks and although it has made my hair thicker it hasnt stopped the shedding so im a bit disappointed now in trying aloe vera juice, hope it works"
2,Great Hair Softener,"Okay, I purchased this product to help with the extreme shedding and breakage I have been experiencing. I have been using the product for 5 weeks now and I still have the same problems with extreme shedding/breakage. HOWEVER, after using this product, my hair is like EXTRA soft. I know there are a lot of hair products that can be used on any and all types of hair but I normally stick to ethnic products and when I researched this product, I didn't know if the reviews were based on that, I just bought it. I like how it softens my hair. I usually relax my hair every 6 to 8 weeks and by the six week, I struggle to make it to the next week. Since using this product, I am almost at week 6 and it doesn't appear that it's almost time for the relaxer. My opinion is that it is a great shampoo and conditioner, the smell, even thought unscented, smell fresh and clean and your hair feels GREAT!"
3,Effective shampoo,I can't really say personally how this product works as they have been gifts to my sisters who live abroad. But as far as I know they're seeing some results.
4,The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life,"The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life was recommended by my prayer partner. It was a book we read and discussed together. I found the book to be insightful, so I gave it as a gift to a church friend for a Christmas gift. The author, Hannah Whitall Smith used the bible to help her understand the joys and problems in her own personal life. She refers to particular Bible chapters and verses when she is faced with joy and problems in her life. I enjoyed reading the book because it helped me understand the Bible better."
5,"This is the best book, besides the Bible, I have ever read!!",This book has help me understand how a closer walk with the Awesome God of the Bible is all about!
5,Packed with wisdom,"The book arrived quickly in used, but good condition. The hardback edition does have some proofing errors, as others have reviewed, but not enough to take away from the relevance of the meaning. HWS's wisdom from years of life application is encouraging and very useful. A woman needs to know how to be a brave, godly woman in these perilous time--yet willing to surrender her rights and to think less of self life and more of Christ life. God Bless! :)"
5,Excellent Teaching,"All ministires that give the salvation invitation would benefit from reading this book. It would be particularly good as a study for small outreach groups, and for all new followers of Christ."
4,The Christian's Secret of a Happy LIbe,Purchased at the request of a library patron. Had timely delivery and was good as new. Others have found it on the shelf to check out also.
1,Buy Cracking the Code by Princeton Review Instead!,My daughter has used Princeton Reviews Cracking the Code to prepare for the ACT in the past and raised her ACT composite significantly -- we thought we'd try something different this time and picked up Peterson's -- in comparison it is difficult to follow -- doesn't give actual tips just for the ACT and the writing is not engaging. Cracking the Code is far superior -- don't waste your money here!
1,abridged beyond recognition,"""This Townsend Library classic has been carefully edited to be more accessible to today's students.""...somehow I missed the description of this when I ordered this particular edition. It is entirely misleading for this book to claim to be written by ""Howard Pyle"" as it has been cut, slashed and dumbed down as to be almost unrecognizable. The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood is a beautifully written work, composed with beautiful language - that's how it should be read and enjoyed. It is not an easy read, but not every beautiful thing in life is supposed to be easy.If you're looking for a cliff notes version of the story, purchase this edition. If you're satified with the shell of a story, great, this is for you. If you're looking to purchase and enjoy ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" by Howard Pyle this is absolutely not it."
4,Good but VERY long.,This is a very long book that is a collection of many short stories about Robin Hood's adventures. It explains all of the characters and settings very nicely. I'm glad I read this.
4,One of the true classics,"I believe this to be the original and, as such, it can be quite hard work at times mentally translating the 'olde English'in which it is written. Having said that though I found that, after a couple of chapters, my translation moved from conscious to sub-conscious thought and the more I read the more that I really started to appreciate the book.What made this book really appealing to me was that it spawned countless other stories, books and movies over many decades and it was great to read the Authors original words which, in many cases, cast Robin Hood in a slightly less flattering light than he is typically portrayed in later media.A little bit of research on Wikipedia is highly reccomended if you are at all interested in how the Story of Robin Hood evolved.I reccommend this book, it's one of those books that make you feel better educated for having read it."
3,"eBook quality good, story didn't quite hold my attention.","As this is a classic I thought I'd have a read of it. I was a bit disappointed in the story, too slow. On the positive side, the quality of this (free) eBook was good."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I purchased this novel to add to my grandsons collection of classics. Only printings as written by the original author will do. The book was exactly as Amazon advertised. I couldn't be more pleased. The pages, print, and binding are first rate. Hand drawn pictures throughout will add to the readers enjoyment. I recommend this book to anyone not wanting a rewritten or shortened version of the original."
4,A fun read,"A story - really many shorter stories in chronological order - about Robin and his group of Brigands... I mean, Merry Men. The stories are a fun, leisurely read. They're not terribly gripping, just entertaining to picture their antics in your mind's eye. The old style English is not difficult to read, although a dictionary may be handy (thank you built-in dictionary function)."
1,The Adventures of Robin Hood,"Book was written in an 'old english' language and very difficult to read and understand. Otherwise the book was interesting, but I got so frustrated that I didn't finish it."
1,The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood.,"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood by Howard Pyle is about some of children's favorite character in green, Robin Hood himself! In the begining of the book Robin shoots the evil kings deer(but not on purpose), and he also kills the sheriff's son because the man shot at him first. Then, the book goes on and they all try to catch him and it goes on and on and on the at the end Robin dies so it is not very good. I don't reccomend this book to many people because it has a lot of hard words and they talk weird. That is my review of The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood."
1,Misplaced book?,This book is listed in the Mystery and Thriller section of Kindle Books. Duh?It's a great traditional tale but it ain't a mystery and it sure ain't a thriller.Maybe they meant Kiddies Books?
1,I think it was a bad book that kept repeating itself.,I think that the book was bad. It repeated the same thing over and over. Robin gets hurt... asks stranger to join his band. Don't get this book!
1,Ben Dover's Review,"Welp, My book kinda stunk i had to read it for a class project it wasnt really my choice but given the chance i think i may have read it at my own descretion. it was a good book for what it was, kinda boring but a classic. ""Adventurous!"""
5,Rolicking Adventure,"Pyle's Robin Hood is a lovable soul, with a child's simplicity and a man's heart. The scenes are vivid, the characters lively, and the tales timeless. It's not Crime and Punishment, but it was never meant to be. Read Pyle's introductory warning, and decide for yourself if you will join him in his wandering through Sherwood Forest."
2,Review of Unabridged Book-on-Tape Version,"We have read, watched, and listened to several versions of Robin Hood, as both my sons (7 and 5) are big fans. We have been able to enjoy these stories as a family. The narration speed of this version, however, is so fast that my husband and I can't relax and enjoy it, and my younger son can't understand it. I understand that it's adventure and that the speed of the narrator should reflect this, but this is just too fast. I was quite surprised, as we've listened to a lot of books on tape and have never had this problem before. After listening to only a few minutes I feel as if I'm going to get a headache. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star is that my seven year old listens to it without complaint."
4,From The Horse's Mouth,"This is a must have for anyone building a success library. This book is strung together from several articles that Getty wrote for Playboy. Included are a review of his success in business and what is takes to be rich, his views on morals, and an indictment of what he saw as a deteriorating social structure of intolerance of any voice of dissent against the powers that be.I really enjoyed this book whether it was regarding success principles that are directly talking about business and wealth or the other indirect opinions he shares about the world. He was one-of-a-kind and his work here is really entertaining to read."
5,Misleading title,"This book goes beyond the matter of making money written by one of the richest people living at his time. Getty writes that 'richness' is at least as much a matter of character, of philosophy, outlook and attitude, as it is of money. And to be truly rich, regardless of fortune or lack of it, a man must live by his own values.While several chapters are average ... the chapter 'The Art of Individuality' if one of the finest chapters i've ever read. Artists of any profession, but in particular entrepreneurs, will profit from Getty's words on being a non-conformist, dissenter and rebel who is seldom if ever satisfied with the status quo."
2,table cloth,"I have not been impressed with this cloth. It stains easily and the stains are hard to get out. I hate sending it to the laundry after each use, and I have tried laundering myself. Does not iron easily. Not a very luxurious cloth."
1,No results,I haven't noticed any chances not even slightly and I've been consuming this product for a little over 3 months...
4,Cant really say much,So far its ok but I havent been taking it that long to give a better review. Ive only been taking for 3 weeks now.
3,Not sure yet,Still in process of trying it out. Will know in 1 more week. Then can determine if worth it r not.
2,It's just okay for most ...but sucked for me!,"I was looking for a product or supplement I could take to give me more vitamins and minerals so looked up different companys and decided to give this one a try,I thought the product would be natural based on the companys website but the product has fructose in it and I hate the taste of fructose and it's not healthy for me at all,the 1 oz on the bottle is not a real 1oz dosage,once refrigerated the taste turns bad,and lastly the product didn't give me any energy at all.I found a much better all natural product called Moringa Oleifea which i can grow in my own garden or order natural sundried crushed leaves with not sugars or artificial ingrediants added plus Moringa has 10 to 15 times more potassium,iron,vitamins and mineral than any health drink on the market.I tried Maximum Living and got a maximum letdown..people get moringa you will thank me and get better benefits from a natural tree than a bunch of ingrediants put together with fructose added."
4,Great!,"I give this a 4 because of taste since I feel like it is very sweet. Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about growing out my hair because I am a bit slow (lol) and get my hair braided to wear a lace front. So I do not see my hair often enough to see length. I can speak on the growth of nails, and not so much that my nails are growing because my nails are naturally strong and grow, but I can tell there is a difference since I work in a lab and wear gloves all the time. My nails used to get soft and flimsy right out of the gloves and now they are still firm coming out of the gloves and after being washed so many times.I also notice I am energetic. I work 12 hr shifts and used to drink Monsters and Rockstars for taste and energy often but now I rarely buy them. I can even get 5 hrs of sleep and still function at work for the 12 hrs without feeling insane.In the end, I feel this product works and I love that it is liquid because I am sure if there were a pill, it'd be horse size."
2,Mineral Rich,I was not very happy with mineral rich in terms of it made me lighter than what I am and I am a fair complected person.In addition I didn't really feel the enger that it was suppose to give. I stoped taking it because I didn't seel any hair growth.I believe Honesty love was telling the truth about this product and it worked for her and those who may wear their hair natural.to be honest i didn't see much results.
3,It's not what I expected!,"I haven't seen any real increase in my energy levels at all. Neither have I experienced any other benefits that I am aware of. I will order it one more time and if nothing changes, I will look for another liquid vitamin."
3,Gives me lots of stomach gas,"When I first got this product I use the recommended serving 1oz. It tastes good, I took it with the 8oz of water they suggest. Later in the day I started having lots of gas. I thought maybe it was something I ate with it so I decided to take it by itself in the morning before I ate breakfast and I had the same experience. I decided to reduce the serving to 1/2oz mixed into 8oz of water. That seemed to work better. It still gives me gas but it is not as severe. I will continue to use it but not everyday, maybe 2 times per week because I can't take it daily."
4,Great Taste,"The taste is not bad at all. Pros it helped with hair growth and regularity, Cons it would have to be that sugar is used to help with the taste. I will continue using this product."
1,"Horribly thin band, beautiful ring otherwise","As the previous reviewer stated, the band on this ring is just intolerably thin. The first ring I received was so beautiful that I hoped the crumpled band was an aberration, so I contacted the company and sent it back for a replacement. They were very courteous and prompt in all communications. Unfortunately, the second ring also had a hair-thin band, but at least it wasn't already crumpled in the box! I'm afraid to wear it; it's so thin. But it's so beautiful and relatively inexpensive that I decided to keep it, and maybe look into getting the band reinforced -- although that will likely cost more than the ring did."
3,A good simple movie for kids,"I liked this movie okay. I wished it could have been a bit more thorough and detailed, but it was fine as-is."
2,Great if you speak French - disappointment otherwise,"We have three of the books in this series and love them, but were very disappointed with this book. Yes the illustration are beautiful as with the other books, but about half the text is in French. I'm sure that's great if you speak French but its miserable for those of us who don't. German or Italian would have been fine but I couldn't even stumble through the French and the story was mostly lost as a result."
4,"Quite good, but not as good as some of the other McDuffs","I love the McDuff books, and my two-year-old always likes reading them. I thought the French phrases were great, and the story was fun. But the illustrations were not quite up to par, to my mind. I LOVED the illustrations in the other books -- they were so detailed, with those little 1930s details(or whenever it's supposed to be; I put it in the 30s in my mind), and less cartoony. If I had seen this book as the first of the McDuff books, I would have enjoyed it, but I wouldn't have ""fallen for it"" like I did for ""McDuff Moves In"" and ""McDuff and the Baby."" My husband agrees with this assessment. (It's a grownup opinion though -- I kind of doubt my son misses the retro touches or minds the more cartoonish look.)"
5,An incredible New Voice Mixes Alt Pop/jazz/R&B,"Wil has a voice that is soulful beyond his years. The dynamic fusion of alternative rock/R&B and Jazz is sure to attract a wide audience. The songs are powerful, and the cover of ""My Girl' would make the Temptations proud...this guy is going to go THRU THE ROOF!"
4,Great New Artist!,"I first heard about Wil Seabrook online and picked up his debutCD based on the feedback I saw posted. I haven't been disappointed.Wil has a great voice, a warm, smooth tenor. Great hooks, modest use of samples and very well produced. These songs would sound right at home on AAA radio, and I expect I'll be hearing them there before long."
5,Buy this CD now!,"This is a dazzling debut album! Wil's smooth voice, the soulful and colorful lyrics of his songs, and groovy background rhythms are the elements that make this album so powerful for me. The mass populace is going to find out about this guy very soon. It's only a matter of time."
2,So much for Zero Noise...,"No good for car Audio! These were worse than my cheap cables I purchased at Wal-Mart. The alternator whine was unbearable and these would pick up all kinds of interference even with the engine off. The cables are nice quality, but THEY AREN'T SHIELDED. For automotive applications you almost always need shielded audio interconnects. And no, I did NOT run these next to power wires, they ran down the middle of my cabin where there are no wires to interfere with. I returned these cables and purchased some high dollar Component Video Cables from Monster, that fixed my problem. I give 2/5 because the cables are nice quality, but they are NOT for car audio."
4,Martin Sheen in an excellent role.,"I thought that Martin Sheen did a superb job in this movie. I also liked the story. I really cannot give you specifics, I just thought it was well done and I had an enjoyable time watching it."
2,Boring!,I kept waiting for this to get better but it never did. I can't say that I'd recommend it to anyone.
3,Little dated but offers a lot to think about,"I bought this and Dr. Sears new book, The Vaccine Book, at the same time. Both books contain similar information, but Dr. Sears is a little more up to date, especially on the thimerisol issue (which is no longer an issue). Both offer similar modified vaccination schedules. Both examine each vaccine, why it is given, disease history, and pros and cons of vaccination. I honestly didn't read this book as in depth since I had read The Vaccine book first. If you are looking for an all out ""don't vaccinate"" book, this is not it. But, if you are looking for a book that examines why, with what and alternatives, this book will examine those (although it is not without bias)"
5,Well balanced review of issues related to vaccinations,"This is an excellent book which presents a balanced review of all the major vaccination issues. I felt that the book did a good job to avoid the hype and hysteria that often surrounds the issues. It reviews each mandatory vaccination and the history leaving the parent with a good starting point to making an informed, if difficult, decision."
3,Okay,"This book is a little out dated. New information and new vaccines are out and being given since this book has been out. Overall, this book is okay. I think it needs to be updated."
2,Don't Reccomend,"While this book does provide some valuable information, it also provides a lot of scare tactic type advice. I don't like when Dr's try and convince people to vaccinate by using scare tactics and I don't like when opponents of vaccinations use scare tactics to prove vaccinations are dangerous. There are dangers with vaccinations, as well as many benefits. Parents need to know about the diseases, the ingredients in vaccines, and they need to make decisions themselves. Repeated examples of the one in 250,000 kids who gets a life threatening illness as either a result of not vaccinating or a result of a vaccination isn't helpful at all. This book is full of the latter, which, in my opinion makes it useless in helping with decision making. Scare tactics are an attempt to make the decision for you, and I want to make my own decisions regarding my children's health. Facts are what are needed."
2,There are better books out there.,"This book is fine if you need a medical opinion but it does not go far enough reporting on the hazards of vaccination. Also, the author advocates selective MMR (individual measles, mumps and rubella shots) but this option does not exist. ..."
1,"Biased opinion, only one side of the story","The author presents their opinions on vaccinations, then discusses a few studies to support only their opinion. Very one-sided and biased. This book came recommended, but left me very disappointed. Read some of the other good books on this topic by Neustaedter or Miller to get the rest of the story."
1,Creating fear,"I just had to console a mom in tears because of this book. She knows her child should get vaccines, and is at real risk without them, but is so fearful about getting vaccines. This book does a great job...of seeming to be researched and referenced, but the data does not support the assertions made of the risks of vaccines.Great for conspiracy theorists, people looking to assign blame, and doctors who want to make money selling their book. Really unconscionable!"
5,outstanding!,"Our society discourages us from questioning anything. As a responsible parent, we need to educate ourselves on healthcare so that we may make informed decisions about our children. There are options, for those who take the time to find out the options. This book is not anti-vaccine. It gave us a road map on how to administer vaccines safely to our second child after our first child was vaccine-damaged (how to spread out the shots, what sorts of supplements we could use to prepare the body for vaccines, how to make sure our vaccines were thimerasol-free, etc). Stephanie Cave and Deborah Mitchell are champions for our kids. My hats off to them for creating an easy read that was highly informative and possibly saved my second child from the same fate that my first child suffered.Tricia Morin"
4,A Very Valuable Tool,I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the info is outdated. The book is great but needs to be updated-errors changed and re-released. The author gives a suggested alternate vaccination schedule to follow which is what I chose to do for my child.Mercury may not still be in vaccines in an amount like they used to be but other chemicals are. I would suggest that the author include these things. Such examples are; MSG and formaldahyde. She touches on Aluminum but doesn't mention that vaccines are made in the tissues of other animals like Monkey Kidney tissue. She doesn't explore the problem of this DNA and RNA of these animals sitting dormat in the human body until they are ready to reap havock on our immune system.
2,There Are Better Books Out There,"This book is fine if you need a medical opinion but it does not go far enough reporting on the hazards of vaccination. Also, the author advocates selective MMR (individual measles, mumps and rubella shots) but this option does not exist. Therefore, many parents are still left wondering what to do. This is why I recommend the book, Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? It is very compelling and does not pander to the medical community. Instead, the author presents numerous studies that I have not seen published in other vaccine books."
5,Excellent Book!,"Just wanted to put my vote in the five-star column - I think this book is very valuable and should be read by anyone with children (or anyone that has a body of their own, for that matter). Dr. Cave goes into a lot of detail about the background of vaccinations and explains how they may have links to autism, auto-immune disorders and other prevelant disorders of the 20th and 21st Centuries. If nothing else you may just think twice about loading a newborn down with things his not-yet-developed immune system can handle and trying to plan it out better and/or not use formulas with mercury in them. Bravo Doctor, don't listen to the critics of your well-written book, they probably work for Eli Lilly."
4,"very concise, easy to read","I definitely recommend this book for any parent who feels overwhelmed, concerned, uninformed, nervous or just plain undecided about vaccinating their child. I was struggling for some time with the decision on whether or not to vaccinate my son, and if I did vaccinate, when to do it. This book clearly explains the pro's and con's of each vaccine, the purpose of each vaccine, recommends a schedule/timeline for administering them, and remains objective throughout. I really appreciated the fact that this was NOT an opinionated book full of ""you should do this,"" and ""you should not do that"" kinds of statements.I did, however, find it a bit basic, and as much as I appreciated and used the information presented in this book, I still did extra research online. That said, I found my ""internet research"" much easier to do after reading this book. I have since lent this book out to other parents who have also found it very helpful."
2,Out of date,"This book may have been a good reading when it was published back in 2001. Unfortunately, I bought the kindle edition and didn't realize about this, given that the kindle edition indiciates it was published in 2008.The author speaks about the future promise of mercury free vaccines, well that's history now. It cites Dr Wakefield's research as an authority on vaccine research, well we all know what happened there, and finally it includes under vaccines of the future many vaccines that are currently part of the schedule. Having said that, some of the other information is informative. However, I can't recommend this book unless it's updated. Many things have changed in the vaccine world within the last 10 years."
4,Extremely informative,"This book contains a lot of things that, as parents, one should know. It suggests options for vaccinations, reminding us that vaccinations (not all of them, and not all at the same time) are good."
3,"only ok, not the best biography you can see","this video makes little mention of some important things that some people wouldn't really much care if it was omitted. it's pretty good, makes good mention of his political background, his political friends, his foes, the declaration of independence. a bit about his private life is revelealed also, however, i'm not overall satisfied by the video."
3,"For women only, no heavy lifting","I was surprised to note that the author was male, for the book is female oriented all the way. Not a total waste of time, sort of mental junk food for a rainy weekend. If you enjoy a literate romance, you could do worse, I suppose."
2,Headache Tea,"I'm not sure why I brought this tea, but it truly gave me and my husband annoying headaches.The tea taste very good! Just add lemon and sugar!"
4,Keeps on going!,We have had this tv for many years now and it still works great! We bought it at a Best Buy when we were looking for a tv to put in our bedroom. The price was great but not a brand we were familiar with. We gave it a shot and have been very happy with it.I do have a problem with it changing to Mono from stereo always at the exact time everynight which is weird but doesn't really affect anything for me.The DVD player isn't seperate so yes you do have to change back and forth but if I'm watching a movie then I'm not watching tv so its not a big deal either.The picture is good and the volume is great.Its lasted this long without a problem - overall I am glad we took the chance because we have definetly gotten our moneys worth!
2,Good DVD bad TV,"Bought this unit from another store. The DVD works fine, the TV works fine half the time the other half the contrast goes very dark, switching back and fourth every three or four seconds. It was returned, now awaiting repair/replacement."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I have to agree with many of the other reviews I have seen. I would give the product (and company) zero stars if that was an option.The TV picture is OK, but the DVD player is almost useless. mine will not even identify that a disc is in it now. I did know that my unit was out of warranty when it brokedown. But I had emailed the company for some troubleshooting suggestions on how to overcome the difficulties with the DVD. They would not even reply to the email.So I will quickly be replacing this TV/DVD with a brand that works and will never buy an Apex product again."
4,A great inexpensive TV,"I bought this 20"" Apex flat screen television to replace my girlfriend's ageing 12 year old bedroom TV (19 in.). She loves it!The MTS stereo sound (5 watts) is good and the speakers do not distort at full volume. Because of the flat screen and advanced technology the picture is sharper, cleaner, crisper. As you can read, the Apex has a 181-channel tuner and a V-chip.The best was the price. This was a great price and a very good TV."
1,BUYER BEWARE - You are stuck if anything is wrong,"There is a risk that the TV will arrived damaged or not working to your satisfaction.Be aware this 100+lb TV is freight shipped, meaning that if anything is wrong with the unit, you are stuck with it. Amazon will not take back even if the TV or DVD unit is defective. In my case, the dvd tray on the unit arrived broken.So even though this item is priced great, how much is your time worth?I made a game of trying to get through to Apex, the manufacturer, on their Customer Service number. So far, mainly busy signals, or if you are lucky enough to get through, get ready for a hold time in HOURS. Thus far, the situation is still unresolved. Amazon will not help in the resolution, leaving me to deal with the Apex. I have already paid a great additional cost in my time dealing with this mess.Sorry, but unless you are willing to accept it at a great deal no matter the ""hassle factor"", I say stick to items that you can return if something ends up being wrong."
2,Never again,I would never puchase another item from this company.I purchasd this item back in October and now the dvd part of thie television is not functioning.The company Apex is not honoring their service agreement. The service center thay gave me the number to no longer sevices their products and they have to tried to resolve this matter.I would never have purchased this item if I would have known that
2,"Great TV, miserable DVD","This is great when used for TV, but the DVD player is pathetic. I constantly have to deal with image scrambling and voice/picture off-sync. I also have the problem of vibrating tray - which is enough to drive anyone nuts! DVD mode loses your place if you accidently switch to TV mode, which happens more than you might think . Having to open the remote to start a movie pretty lame, there should be a more accessible 'enter' button. Warrantee is lousy. Would love to return due to manuf. defects, but cannot! Very dissappointed."
2,Watch It From A Historical Perspective,"About forty-five minutes into this movie, I basically lost interest. The main problem with this film is that it is so dated that it is almost unbearable to watch. It is just one of those movies that just didn't age well with time. If anything, this movie is worth watching ONLY for the historical perspective, being that it is the first Hollywood movie musical and the first talky picture to have won an academy award. Otherwise, the plot leaves very little to be desired, the acting is far too melodramatic even for the standards of the time, and the music is, well, not catchy. The only thing I particularly liked about Broadway Melody is that it is just SO 1920's, a time when women were naturally curvy and naturally beautiful and the fashion was just so cute and adorable. At the end of the day though, this movie is just not worth watching for anything more than just the historical background."
3,3an a half stars...,"well as compared to the momas an poppas its a very good albumi like to compare them as black mommas an poppas ...the album has nice qualitieis in astrology an the stars the mommas an poppas didnt semm to astrologize that much although, i realy havent herd all there music ...creatively speeking there group name is superiotious to most as far as completeness appears an seems... ps it arrived rather slow from wall mart we wonder why ???shdfh..."
3,"Ok, but not the greatest","It was ok but not their greatest. Nice cover design for the cd label, though."
5,The Ageless Aquarius,"I was in sixth grade when I first bought this album and it captivated me then; it captivates me now. Clearly, the Fifth Dimension were one of the better, if not the best, vocal groups of their day and their sound is as fresh and uplifting today as it was back in '69.From the fairly decent rock rendition of ""Sunshine of Your Love"" to the jazz cabaret sounds of ""Hideaway"", the Fifth Dimension handle a wide variety of musical styles with aplomb and distinction. Although the bonus track is a bit out of place and probably should've been relegated to a rarities album, it's an interesting piece that shows another side of the group's musical talents.All in all, this is a very enjoyable album and I'd recommend it for all casual and serious fans of the Fifth Dimension."
4,Almost As Good As I Remembered It,"Long before CDs there was a beautiful thing called vinyl, and this was one of my sixth-grade favorites. (At least sixth graders back then were getting some quality pop music!) While the record on whole is fine, and its CD release is certainly welcome and more than a little overdue, I realize now that I basically stuck with side one. And side one stuck with me. The tremendous vocals, beautiful harmonies, and tasty arrangements will get inside you and stay there. Even if some of the side two selections are curious, this remains a great album."
2,Interesting but not compelling rendition of Macbeth,"Anyone with the chutzpah to transform Scottish kinship wars to the Melbourne underground deserves a pat on the back. To do this, however, the scriptwriters had to chop and move important parts of the text. To make it modern, rock music plays behind the machine-gun scenes. To make it sexy, the witches are transformed into nubile schoolgirls with unlimited libidos. To give it gravitas, nearly all the male parts are played with sullen indifference, off-looks, and head nods.Besides all this, there's the problem of understanding Australian English, with its flat A's; and keeping track of which actor is playing which character, or who just gunned down whom.I found it amusing that Cawdor was transformed into a big rock club for druggies, of which Macbeth becomes thane. There's no possibility of nobility in the Cawdor club......hmmm......it's hard to play Shakespearean tragedy with an anti-hero motif."
3,SO FOUL AND FAIR A FILM I HAVE NOT SEEN,"Excellent copy of Macbeth right down to the Chinese women with automatic weapons. In this version we are dealing with drug lords, kingpins, and rival gangs. What this movie tells me is that not everyone with a British accent can do Shakespeare. The film maintains the darkness and blood imagery associated with Macbeth.About half way through the film I felt I was watching something on the order of ""What's Up Tiger Lily?"" The Macbeth dialouge stopped hitting on all cylinders with the production. I would have enjoyed the film better if I had English subtitles. The DVD didn't have that option.Sex, nudity (Chloe Armstrong, Kate Bell, Miranda Nation, Victoria Hill)"
3,Not bad,Bought this DVD purely after seeing Sam Wortington in Terminator: SalvationWhile this is nothing greatIt was entertaining enough and of course Sam W has charisma to spare and he does carry the movie.The movie was a tad pretentious sometimes (eh the slowmo climatic gunfight) and the production wasn't that great but still not bad.The dialogue was a bit hard to follow sometimes as it's Shakespear and there are no subtitles!I found the changing of the 3 witches into young school girls a bit weird though
1,Terrible,"I bought this thinking that I could show it to my high school students--maybe a new twist on the text. However, not only was it poorly done, it was completely inappropriate for high school students. It seemed as if every time Lady Macbeth spoke, she needed to do a line of cocaine. In addition, Macbeth receives the witches' prophecies while having an orgy with them. So ridiculous. It was overacted and had tons of gratuitous violence. Yes, Macbeth is a violent play, but did they need to make the murder of Lady MacDuff sexually gratifying to her murderer? It just seemed way too over the top."
1,not for high school students,"As an English teacher, I am always looking for new things to spark my students' interests. I purchased this movie thinking that it could be a new twist on the play to watch after finishing the play. While watching this movie, I was horrified. It was sick, twisted, and poorly done. Is there a particular reason why Macbeth has to receive his predictions from the witches during an orgy? There is just no point. If you are a teacher, this is definitely not a school appropriate video! Just a heads up!"
2,NOT FOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH CLASS,"Initially, I thought it did a great job of using modern-day with Shakespearean language. I watched closely for the first witch scene, which was not bad. I did not watch the movie in its entirety. Needless to say, there were racy- triple (xxx) rated scenes. Not even appropriate for a College class!!!"
5,Don't get Kno bigga Kno Betta in The Wood than BIG SYKE!!!!,"From One albun to the next Big Syke holds it down. One of his strongest lyrikly and kontinues to represent the West Koast. A must by, a must have. Keep it Real!!! M.O.B. Inglewood Family"
2,Changed Formula,"Used to be the best brand name product for cleaning windows. Now, maybe due to environmental laws or cost reducing, this product leaves streaks and makes glass appear foggy and dingy. Try for yourself by cleaning a glass table when it's daylight out. You can see streaks in the glass even with a lint free cloth. Not sure if this is something specific to CA environmental laws but worth looking into."
4,Wonderful for every Rocky enthusiast!,"For everyone that loves to do the Time Warp, this is a great CD. Granted, this is not the Rocky Horror Picture Show soundtrack, but it is the soundtrack to the London play written and starring Richard O'Brien which inspired the great cult-classic movie. Tim Curry does sound a little different than the movie, but only because he was 2 years younger, and also movies sound different than open theaters. Hot Patootie is not done by Meatloaf, only because this soundtrack was made before the Rocky Horror craze was introduced to America. All in all, I think this is a great album for Rocky Horror aficionados and collectors. For those of you that only know and like the movie, this album is not for you."
2,Sweet Trans... dear lord make it end.,"I was unfortunate enough to listen to this CD during a lunch break at school... I almost cried. That's how horrible I, and my other RHPS enthusiasts, believed it to be. Be forewarned! It's done improperly, making it sound utterly horrid and NOTHING like any version of RHPS should be. I was angered by this... Grrrr... I LOVE the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but you have to do it right or just not even attempt it at all. The singers were not in any specific character, sounded overly choral, and was just utterly... wrong. *tear* So sad. The only reason why I even gave it two stars is just because it's the RHPS. They get minimal credit for at least attempting, even though they killed it.Oh yes, I do understand that these people are not the original cast and are expected to sound different... but DIFFERENT is not the same thing as unbearable."
4,old favorite,"Wow, I can't believe I just saw this plate on Amazon, I bought the 16 piece/service for 4 set of this design maybe 15 years ago..been very good to me! The only complaint is the coffee cups are tiny and the bowls could be a little bit deeper. I love the design, they obviously have held up well over the years, I used them exclusively until a few months back. I never had a chip until a month ago when I dropped a large heavy coffee cup on a bowl in the sink..."
3,alchemy or spagyric?,"I havent read this book, but I am very doubful, if this really about alchemy. I heard, that laboratory equipment, that author proposes, is very expensive and thats not a case of alchemy. Alchemy in its essence need very simple and nonexpensive instruments. There exist fundamental difference between spagyrics and alchemy and that fact many people dont realize."
4,Good set of markers,Good set of markers. I used them for adult coloring books. Not good for stained glass type coloring pages as the wetness of the markers makes the page curl.
1,shipping charges,"It's my own fault for not checking the shipping, but I thing almost $7.00 shipping is a bit much for a set of marker not even worth $3.00. Won't make the same mistake."
4,"Not Nero Wolfe, but Pretty Good","Rex Stout is, of course, seated at God's right hand even now for having written the sublime and always amusing Nero Wolfe mysteries. Rush right out and read EVERY ONE of them right now.I'll wait.Okay, done? I was right, wasn't I? The Nero Wolfe novels really are that good. Well, Stout wrote some other detective novels featuring Tecumseh Fox (3 novels, all okay) and Dol Bonner-- this novel, ""The Hand in the Glove,"" is the only full-length Bonner, and it's very good. She also shows up in some of Nero Wolfe's adventures, doing work for the Great Man when Archie Goodwin is too busy or the wrong sex to do the job.The plot is fine and the writing is up to Stout's usual sterling standards, and Inspector Cramer, Wolfe's red-faced nemesis, even shows up late in the book. If you've read all the Nero Wolfes, read this-- you'll enjoy it."
2,I'm Leaving on a Jet Plane...and Giving this Only 2 Stars,"I bought this from a store because of the Chip Davis name and my desire for a soothing background CD. I put it in and hit the replay button for continuous loop play. Initially, I thought that the jet airplane noise recorded with the birdsong was just an unusual plane flying overhead, but realized with the third loop that it was on the CD itself. You'd think that when Mr. Davis reviewed the ambience soundtrack prior to releasing it, that he would have noted this. It feels sloppy, somehow, as if someone left machines to record in a bird-filled wooded area and then just transferred the recording to CD without checking the quality. Instead of the soothing ambience I was hoping for, I find myself waiting for that bloody jet airplane noise. Just ruins the effect for me.See the ""More Like 2 1/2 Stars"" review below as well..."
2,Wailing synth!,"My iTunes classifies this CD as 'New Age'. Rightly so. In addition to the pleasant sounds of nature that I thought I was buying, there has been an attempt to overlap musical notes generated by a synthesizer. I don't really care for it. If you are looking at a 'sounds of nature - birdsong' CD this is not it. If you are fond of the New Age wailing synthesizer, go ahead."
3,Part of it worked...,I purchased the black light with the Simple Solution Cat cleaner. The light worked great but the cleaner didn't remove the stain. I followed the instructions to no avail...
3,good the first time,This spray covered the smell the first few times but my cat kept going back to the same place to pee even after I cleaned the carpet and after a few times it was not working as well. I wish it stopped the smell enough so that my cat couldnt smell it
4,Cat odor remover,"This product works well in keeping my cat from urinating on the same spot on the carpet. I am getting hardwood floors, so I am anxious to see how it works on them, since it needs to be left and not wiped up."
1,Will not buy again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I will not buy this product again, just did not get the job done,I will find another product that works better, smell still there. Poor product."
3,Must have been heavily revised...,"If you are looking for Duffy's original, I would avoid James Beard's edition. Duffy's own comments have been replaced almost entirely by Beard's. Also, Beard appears to have inserted and modified recipes without any indication of which are which. How else would you explain a drink called an ""H Bomb,"" something right out of the fifties, but unknown in the nineteenth century? This edition includes many great recipes, though, and it holds the same nostalgic interest for the modern day that Duffy's original must have held for Beard."
3,strictly drums and bass,"I was really dissappointed with it, I guess the deeper side of drum and bass is only a mix with drums and bass, the last tracks add slight synths. It felt like I was being teased the whole time though, a stipper that wont take off her clothes type deal. Time for a breakdown, goes back to what it was, somewhat aggrivating. It is a good foundation for a great cd, ADD good breakdowns, and some synths and this would be great, DO A REMIX TEEBEE! for now though its ok, I would recommend another of his cds first, through the eyes of a scorpion for example."
5,Moving and Beautiful,This is a moving and beautiful set by Torcuato Mariano. Stellar guitar playing (what else did you expect from TM?) and delightful melodies throughout make this another winner. Just wish he toured the USA more often!
2,Not good,"I read this book with high hopes. I am bitterly disappointed. While the military may have carried out assassination attempts in real life to do so in this scenario makes them nothing but murders and butchers. I have the first three books of this new series and I do not think I will read 2 and 3. I actually found myself being happy when the mud grunts got killed or wounded. Also to murder a civilian just because he might id you is atrocious, why couldn't they take him with? Nah it is just a sucky plot line."
3,Decent Spinoff,"I thought that this spinoff was not bad. It was a good read and brought in more politics and the moral complexities that occur within the Special Operations Community.I love the StarFist series and will continue to eagerly await the books, I may read the next book in this series.Again, a decent book but not up to par with the Starfist or even the Demontech series."
2,Huge disappointment,"I have come to eagerly await the publication of each Starfist book, so I couldn't wait to read this spin-off series.Wow. I was so incredibly disappointed. The story plods, then bounces about and then rights itself only to plod again. Unlike the standard Starfist series, there is no cohesion of plot, the characters are unlikeable and two-dimensional and (as mentioned elsewhere) I found myself rooting AGAINST the protagonists.It was a genuine struggle to finish the book. I will not be reading anymore of this series and will desperately hope that the regular Starfist series maintains a higher level of quality."
2,Guess we are just looking for money now...,I was really looking forward to this book coming out. Now I read it and thought I should have saved my money. This book is not written well at all. It is very choppy with several different shifts in area and they do not transition well at all. Also has much needless brutality. If the Force Recon Marines are so good at not being seen and are so skillfull why all the extra bodies around? This story line could have a lot of promise but if the rest of the line is written like this save your money.
1,Not so much plot twists as slow plot curves with ample signage.,"While Sherman none of Shermans books that I have read could be noted for complex or overly shprising plots, this one reaches a new low. It starts with a survey of all the political charcters being introduced by way of annoying gluttous epicurean metaphors and just goes down hill. From there it is a pretty strightforward unfolding of what is described on the back cover."
3,Not quite as good as the Star Fist Series,"The book is a good read, though it does seem to lack some of the quality of the main StarFist series."
2,Disappointing ..... to say the least!,"I have enjoyed all the ""Starfist"" books to this point. I don't know what the authors were thinking when they put ""Force Recon"" together, but it was frankly a flop. Maybe someone needed a paycheck or the publisher was pushing for something new. Whichever, this was a poor example of what the authors are capable of. Coming from a family of Marines and with friends still in the Corps, some currently deployed with real Force Recon units, I found this book less than pleasing. Maybe the next installment will be better."
2,Your government in action...,"Actually, the book ticked me off. It was probably TOO authentic, contrasting the professionalism of the specops group to the smallminded pettiness of the bureaucrats controlling their assignments. Some good action, and ""magic"" equipment was interesting. I still like to see the good guys win, not get used by the turkeys."
3,You get what you pay for,"APEX PD 100 is an O.K. personal DVD player for what it's worth. The screen have both wide screen and standard switch. The image is so fuzzy I can't read the text on the DVD menu screen. During wide screen DVD playback, the image and sound pause often by itself while the dvd drive reads the disk. It does comes with a battery pack, but you have to use a jumper cable to connect the battery to the dvd player. If you lose the jumper cable, you are out of luck. One other thing that I don't like is that the player sqeeks like an old door whenever I flip open the screen or open the dvd drive's lid. The sound is great. It comes also with a remote control. This dvd player can also play MP3 CD, VCD (which I like),and music CD. I am giving it a three star because of its price, which is unheard of in the portable DVD players market."
2,"looks good, sounds not so good.","the picture quality of this player was average to above average.a little bit grainy,but good enough to watch a movie on.the sound,on the other hand,is something that i was not impressed with at all.now, i dont know if it was just this specific player or if all apex players are like this,but this one had terrible crackling when the volume was turned up just a little passed the halfway mark,and when the movie i was watching had some kind of explosion,i thought the left speaker was going to blow!another problem i experienced with this player was the playing of a music cd, i could not hear 1 entire song without a constant skip.over all, i would say that the price is good for this player, but the quality is not what it should be.i returned the player."
1,Piece of junk,"Back in 1999, a friend of mine bought an Apex DVD player (not a portable). It offered a terrible picture, so he took it back and - on my recommendation - got a Panasonic, which has made him happy for the last three years.Since I could buy the PD-100 for such a great price, I decided to give Apex another shot. After all, three years is a long time, so they may have improved. Nope. Initially, the player worked fine. The picture seemed somewhat fuzzy, but it played back accurately. However, after I tested two DVDs, the third showed a VERY distorted image. It looked like a camera negative! I shut off the player and tried again - same thing. I let it ""rest"" for a few hours and tried again - same thing.The piece of junk broke after literally 10 minutes of use! It's going back to Amazon and I'll buy a Panasonic instead - I learned my lesson..."
5,"Agreed , truly awesome collection belongs in every Bacharach library","If you grew up loving the remarkable music of Burt Bacharach and Hal David and enjoy tradition jazz , this is an absolute must own . Each and every one of the above compositions are treated with the greatest respect . Just look at the above artists and take a sample listen to the tracks (above) . This is a superb collection . Great and brief liner notes enclosed lay it all out for you and hit the mark perfectly . Even better than you might imagine . Culled from recordings spanning 1965 through 1970 . Beautiful . As you'd anticipate , this is not a ""hard"" blowing session . It's mostly ballad to mid tempo gold with a glut of great playing and soloing . Perfect for curious smooth jazz folk or fans of these artists (jazz) who are interested in how they perform these pop songs circa the period indicated . Very accessible while still being entirely trad jazz ."
1,Disappointed,I thought this slicer was stainless steel and the writer must have meant that only the wire was stainless steel.
3,Be Happy It Won't Burn Your Records...,"Those who are going to purchase this need to pay close attention to the fact that this is for studio-club standard or club DJ and scratching purposes. This is something to play records loud at a venue where the crowd is not going to be analyzing whether you used a mid-end or hi-end set up---who will care as long as the music is going.This also indicates that the Stanton 500 is not for audiophile casual listening purposes to play your favorite classical or jazz records for it's frequency range is somewhat limited and will not track very complex passages, especially loaded with high frequencies. Most low-burn cartridges will have a round stylus tip and not an elliptical or a costlier linear one. For those would not be DJ standard cartridges but your expensive in-home listening grades...The Stanton will get the job done, but it will not perform high end or audiophile quality sound or groundbreaking sonic miracles !"
3,OK starter carts,"These are definitely meant to only get a DJ off the ground. They are very dull in the highs and do not possess the greatest clarity. After hearing some Shure carts, I thought my Stanton's were mono, lol.And the first reviewer had it correct. These have sperical styli which have HIGH record burn due to the styli exerting greater force to the groove's outside walls as a result of its shape not fitting as well as an elliptical styli. The only benefit of the spherical styli is that they offer superior tracking which is perfect for scratching. But I will admit, I backcue often while beatmatching and I experienced a great degree of record burn over the course of a year with these carts. I would not recommend these if you are simply straight mixing (no scratching) with records you value."
2,Low-End Stanton cartridge,"Low End cartridge. A decent cartridge would have an elipitical stylus, and not damage your vinyl so fast."
4,Return of the Jedi (Step-Up Movie Adventures),The book is pretty good. I was a lttle disapointed with the scenes pictured in the book. They were dark and I believe there were better scenes to pictorially represent the movie.
2,Not very good,"I'll admit this book is for younger kids, but I have to say that it was not very good at all. Even when I read it for the first time when I was ten years old I didn't think it was very good. The characters are all faceless and boring, except for Han who is hugely exaggerated. The writing is also boring and unimaginative, and very undiscriptive. Children ten and under probably won't care, but adults and older kids such as myself should stick with Young Jedi Knights, and some of the adult novels."
1,Pretty good...,"This book suffered from the same things the movie did--namely, a lack of action. The book even left out some of the major parts, like a great deal of the space-based assault on the second Death Star, and instead concentrated on intangible elements like the Force. Don't get me wrong--I like the Force--it's just that it does not lend itself to description in a book."
2,"I have to give it credit, but it left ALOT!","I read this book, aafter I had seen the movie several times and I must say, Elizabeth Levy left out alot of the Romance and other things. But she did put a different view on things. I would give it 2 1/2 stars, but I can't!"
3,No external cover,I bought this item. It was sent to me without any form of wrapping or an effort to maintain the privacy to the shopper. Apart from that the setup was relatively easy. It was a nice product.
3,Hopper,"It was easy to put together, but not that stable when you put balls in and working with it at the court. It tends to slip and fall flat. If ther were some rubber cushioning, that could be avoided."
3,Wilson Ball Pickup Review,"This Pickup is ""okay."" To me, okay is it picks up the balls easily as advertised, does what is supposed to do. However it needs to have some improvements. For example, It does not always stand sometimes it drops down onto the floor and the balls roll away. Its height is not good for a tall person like me. I need to bend down to get the balls consuming more time. I would recommend this product to people who are not tall and can deal with balls rolling away at some points."
4,Wilson Ball Hopper Review,The Wilson Ball Hopper does a great job picking up the balls. If is sometimes hard to bring down the arms and stand it up to serve balls. Both of my kids (9 and 4 years old) pinched their fingers trying to set it up as a basket for me to feed them balls. I think it is great deal for the price.
4,Great buy with some issues.,"I just started playing and this is a great item for practicing. I love the fact that it stands and then folds so u can carry it. The only things that bother me is the locking of the legs and then the closing. I still don't think that is a large issue, still a great buy."
3,It's... Ok,"It worked great at first, but it started falling apart. The handles fall off really easily, and the screws are constantly falling off. I've had to use zip ties to hold it together. However it does pick up the balls well and it's definitely better than nothing"
1,Not good,1. way too heavy.2. not easy to convert between picker and basket.3. screws are always loose.
4,Ball hoppers are essential,"I think ball hoppers are essential for learning tennis, teaching someone else tennis, and for intermediate players working on their serve.this one works just fine. Possible complaints (minor):legs just fit into a slot - could be secured in some fashionfour screws keep the basket together - they can be come loose. Can be annoying - have to watch out for it."
5,Goodbye loads of cans... hello simplicity.,"So after waiting to purchase for over a year the darn thing went on a bit of a sale. We bit and it was worth it. Probably should have purchased at the few dollars more last year or when we first saw it. I'd say it's worth $25. Super easy to assemble with just a wrench or pliers. Sturdy and quite efficient. We emptied out at least 10 cans of ""practice"" balls and it barely looks one-third full. Anyway, it is easy to assemble and once that's done you're good to go. There may be a bit of a storage placement issue as you have to keep the handles in the up or down position to be efficient. We have an Escape and it's fine on the backseat floor when transporting to a court. I don't know how well you can transport in a little car. There is a cover intertwined as part of the unit and it's fine. If you had to transport on a back seat you'd have to have the handles at 90 degrees and there would be no room for a passenger there. Worth the purchase."
2,Just OK,I purchased it to go with my ball machine. It is flimsy and doesn't work as well picking up balls as my GAMMA. One good thing is that it has a clasp to keep the handles from falling down which the GAMMA does not have. I am going with a GAMMA next time.
2,Ball Pickup,"I was disappointed in this product because, requiring some assembly (which is OK) it did not fit together properly and my daughter, who is very handy, had to improvise to get it into workable condition.Wilson Ball Pickup 75"
3,Wilson Ball Hopper Pickup 75,"I thought it had wheels on it but it didn't. I suggest buying something with wheels, otherwise it gets very heavy to lift with 60+ balls."
2,Not recommended,It has served me well for years but it has also ripped some cloths and scratched my car do to the sharp metal locks on the bottom. There are better ones for sure. I give a more detailed post on my blog - > [...]
4,Great,"Good product at a reasonable price. Remember, like with anything else, you get for what you pay. . . . ."
3,Box,I loved this Box.IT is easy And fast to pick up the ball. And clean the ball also.Everything is all right
4,Haven't had any problem so far.,Haven't encountered any problem that others have mentioned. Been using it for a couple of months; screws aren't falling off and the handles are sturdy. Good buy for its affordable price.One personal gripe is that it's so heavy when it's at full capacity! Feels even heavier when I'm exhausted during play. Now I'm thinking of getting another with wheels...
3,"Good value, but I wish I spent a few more bucks","The hopper does what it was designed to do, but the quality is poor. I don't think it will last long."
5,Great music!!!,This is wonderful music for families. The music and the musicians are very entertaining--the humor can be appreciated by young and old alike. The music is creative and the musicians are very talented. We as a family highly recommend this CD.
4,merrileewesing,"Really loved this so much so that I gave it for presents this Christmas.""The Eleven Cats Of Christmas"" soon became a favorite of my grandson's and there are too many to list that are my favorites--""I Got A Cheese Log""; ""Clothes for Christmas""; etc. Such good vocals, not heard since the 60's groups."
5,Nothing like it (in a good way),"Best Christmas music ever, forget all the stuffy old favorites we all love this album. The kids can't get enough of it but even my wife and I get a kick out of plenty of the songs. If you're looking for a little change to your usual holiday listening give it a try."
4,"not for the ""petite"" frame",It is nice fabric and seems well made. The main thing is that it is wider and longer than I am. At 5'2 the belt ties below my waist and the top bunches a bit because I am not as wide as the top part.I like the adjustable belt on the neck. The color is more moss than sage to me but still nice.
5,Cooking just got a whole lot neater,"This apron is wonderful, a nice heavy cotton fabric, fits comfortably and has been fun to use."
5,Nice product,The color and durability is wonderful. Stronger fabric then I expected. It was a great surprise.
5,Superior Quality,I ordered these aprons for Christmas gifts. I had each one monogramed with names as well as an item that fit each person. Example: One is a chocolate lover-I had a comical chocolate bar put on her apron! These aprons are high quality!
4,Great Quality,"It's made really well and should last for many years to come. The red isn't a bright red, it's closer to the color of my Kitchen Aid mixer which is cool I guess. It's a little longer than I would have liked (I'm 5'7"")but I've been known to slop BBQ sauce below my knees."
3,dumb,"101 Ways to Bug Your Parents is about a boy that wants to go to a convention. He can't because his parents did not have the money to go. If you like to bug your parents then read this book to find out more.My opinion of the book is it is a bit dumb, but I do have a favorite part. It is when someone said ""glow-in-the-dark-butt."" I recommend third and up should read this book. If you like to bug your parents, then this is a good book for you."
3,Not a good book for moms to see,"If you like to bug your parents, you will like the book called 101 Ways to Bug Your Parents. It is a very funny book because of the characters like their nicknames called Hiccup and Sneeze. Those are some funny names.My favorite part about the book is when Steve is trying to go to the convention. He built a nice alarm to wake people up so that when the old alarm clock was all noisy and it got on your nerves, it would wake you up nicely. Steve could not go to the Invention Convention because he had to do summer school.If you like science and inventions you will probably like the book. I think that it is good for 3rd graders and up because it does not have anything bad. But if 3rd graders cannot read that good the teacher has to read it to them."
3,101 ways,101 Ways to Bug Your Parents is about a boy named Sneeze and he invented a nice alarm. He took it to school and Sneeze used Hiccup in the demonstration but it went haywire. Goldie told Sneeze he was not going to the Invention Convention instead he was going to summer school. Sneeze had to find a way to get to the convention.I like this book because Sneeze invented the glow-in-the-dark toilet seat and worked at Gadabout Golf. There is a boy named Ace but no one knows his first name or last name. I think it makes him cool.I think 10-12 year-olds should read this book. They won't know what will happen to Steve and Hiccup. You should read it.
3,it's hilarious,"101 Ways To Bug Your Parents is about a boy named Steve. He wanted to go to the Invention Convention but his parents won't let him because he has to go to summer school for writing class. He gets mad because he still can't go to the convention, but he tries to find a way to get there.It is a very good book because it tells a lot of funny things in the book. He did not want to listen to his parents and gets into a lot of trouble.I recommend this book for 10-12 years old because they could see what would happen to Steve."
3,amazing,"This great book, 101 Ways to Bug Your Parents is about a kid in 6th grade. His name is Sneeze. He wants to go to the Invention Convention, but he can't go because his parents don't have the money. He writes a book and sells it to get there, but then he gets in trouble.I liked this book because he was very angry that he couldn't go to the Invention Convention and he didn't earn enough money. My favorite part is when Ace saves Sneeze. I recommend this book to 4th grade and up because I think this book is confusing."
4,like it,"101 Ways to Bug Your Parents is about a boy named Steve that loved to make inventions, and each time he made one, he took it to school. He was planning to go to the Invention Convention but his mom and dad signed him up for summer school. During summer school a lot of things went haywire.I liked this book because it told ways to bug your parents. I think 4th grade and up should read this book because it is a good book to learn ways to bug your parents at the end of the book."
4,My Repoert,"This report is about a book called 101 Ways to Bug Your Parents. I really do like this book. Not only does it tell you how to bug your parents , but it tells you about a kids dream and his life. This book tells you how it feels to have your parents gone all the time until you go to bed.In this story there is a boy named Sneeze. Sneeze's real name is steve. Sneeze and his best friend hiccup are finally done with 6th grade. Sneeze wants to go to an inventors convention. There is only one problem. SUMMER SCHOOL! So when sneeze walks in the room and see's all his classmates from 6th grade. The class is given a writing assinment. Sneeze decides to write about bugging parents. Then his idea is aproved for a book called 101 Ways to Bug Your Parents.So thenhe opens a shop in the boy's bathroom to sell his book. He finaly makes enough mony to go to the convention. This is all I will tll you. So you will have to read the book to find out what happens."
4,A nice book,A fair book. It's not the greatest. Kind of unusual. A little funny. I think it really dezerves a 3 1\2.
4,"Happy to say, my children didn't torture me...","The kids liked this book, so I read it myself. And boy, was it was fun!Although the title gives the impression that this is the kind of book a parent ought to pass up, it is really very well done.Of course, it includes the list of 101 ways to bug your parents - which was the theme of Sneeze's own story in the book. But can you blame him? After all, his summer vacation WAS ruined!But while Sneeze misses out on his summer plans, he gains a great deal in wisdom. A lot of important things are touched on in this book - what it might feel like to lose one's parent, a growing awareness of financial problems that adults often face, what's truly important in a friend, and even a hint of budding romance.It's all in there! And it puts everything into perspective for Sneeze. I think most kids could learn something from this story.I am impressed by this book and will look for other titles by thia author for my kids to read.Well done!"
4,this is the best book ever,"This great book, 101 Ways to Bug Your Parents, is about a boy in 6th grade who made an invention and brought it to school. The invention was the nice alarm. He tried it out and it hit Hiccup in the nose. Sneeze got a letter from a man and this guy is interested in his nice alarm. Sneeze couldn`t go to the Invention Convention. Sneeze writes a book, 101 Ways to Bug Your Parents. He got in trouble about the book. Sneeze might go to the Invention Convention. Read the book and find out.I like this book because the book showed anger and because he couldn't go to the Invention Convention.I recommend this book for third grade and up because it's funny."
3,"geat idea, lousy execution","You either love John Saul's work or you hate it. The God Project has an incredible plot. Really, it's a brilliant, and original idea. The problem is that Saul's writing is a heavy as lead. His characters never really come to life and his female characters are just jokes. The pace is snail slow and I was even bored for a couple of chapters. The 3 stars are strictly for the sake of the plot."
5,What a Surprise!,This book had everything to keep you entwined in its pages. I think the part that stood out the most was the ending. It totally took me by surprise.
2,To many errors,This book was full of typos or spelling errors. I have never bought a book with so many before. Took away from what would have been a good book.
1,"Start a different ""Project""",There is no nice way to say this. This book Sucks. I have been a loyal John Saul fan from his early books through the more recent ones. I usually find that it is his older novels that I like the most. This book is definitely the exception. Have you every read a book that you hated so much you felt good about skipping pages in it just for self-preservation? This was that book. The plot is non-existent once you actually start reading the book. The premise sounded great and very interesting but the book just didn't live up to the potential it had. Sad attempt.
2,nope,"this was my first book by john saul and it was very dissapointing. i didnt care much for the characters and found the story quite stupid.now, i didnt gave up on this author and im reading these days ""suffer the children"" ... a different story on this one. very good. when i finish it i will gladly make my review... ... but the god project; silly."
1,Dull for a medical thriller/horror,"This book is essentially 300 pages of Sally Montgomery flipping her lid. Boy, did it get old fast. The author should have made the novel a prologue and made the epilogue the novel."
2,Peeling Paint,"There are some favorite releases by Renaissance Records, but have to say Sandy is not the man for it. I heard this a couple of times and it sounds nowhere near what Renaissance would release. I gave Luke Slater a 2 out of 5 stars for his fabric release and even that sounds better! There are a couple of great moments in this 2CD set. However, I got board very quickly. A couple of tracks sounded the same.The biggest problem is the track selection and the mixing. Sandy Rivera uses tunes that have been used to many times on other compilations and he does not stick to a them. Most of these tracks sound like something Dimitri in Paris would use from the early 90's.I would recommend anybody to even steer clear of this Defected Records release. Sadly to say, a record for the worst Renaissance release!! I will listen to this and peel paint!!"
2,Lord have mercy,"....SUCH A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.Based on Sandy's FANTASTIC production, I would expect sooooo much more!!!"
2,sandy rivera dj?,"After the fair to middling Kings of Tomorrow sessions on Minisrty of Sound(Disc 1: garage diva vocals and soul to burn, Disc 2: dreary endless club beats and waiting for something to happen), I had low expectations of this set. Lucky that because half the tunes rock and half are excreable. 'Crimes' is just an insult to the eardrum and some of the vocals like the overrated Robert Owens get on my nerves. The good tunes though are excellent, Quentin Harris and Joi Cardwell make a brilliant pair but although Sandy Rivera makes some worthwhile music I don't think that means he is a great D.J."
5,People often wonder why a National Sales Tax,"I think I've read, this book at least a half dozen times. The more I read it, the more concerned and upset I get about where America is heading.As Gross so clearly points out, we have taxes EVERYWHERE. Not just income taxes, but nearly a 100 different taxes hidden in almost everything we do in our daily lives, from airlines (A) to telephone (T) taxes and everything in between.And how does government continue to perpetuate their ""Tax Rachet"" on the American people? Read this book and you'll never think the same about government and taxes again.This book should be required reading for all Americans."
4,An Overlooked Classic!,"This is one of the best in the Metal Massacre series.The songs by Voivod,Omen,Metal Church,Overkill, and Fates Warning were only available on this compilation, which is worth the price of admission alone.The other tracks are fair,but is mainly worth it for these.If you're a fan of old school power metal, I suggest you get this one or better yet get the Metal Massacre Box set titled""Grim Harvest"" which includes all 12 volumes.Unfortunately the box set is not available on amazon,but you can get it on Metal Blade Records web site.Metal Lives On!"
4,"Feels really big on your tongue, but is pretty cool.","The Red and White Bullsey Logo Barbell Tongue ring isn't something you want to wear everyday because it makes you feel like you have a fat tongue. By the end of the day you're mostly used to it, but it's still a little odd. You can tell by the picture that the bullseye is about twice the size of a normal barbell ball."
2,Age has caught up with Collins' Voice,"I'm a huge Judy Collins fan and love her stuff from the 70's and think her album of Dylan covers in the 90's was great. However, time has caught up with Judy's voice. She sounds frail and wobbly frequently. If she'd recorded this album 20 years ago with a stronger voice, it might have been a great album. As is, however, it's sometimes difficult to listen to. Her cover of Train's huge hit ""Drops of Jupiter"" is particularly painful. And using a synthesizer to fill in for an entire orchestra on Copland's ""Lincoln Portrait"" is just wrong. This album is for hardcore Collins' fans only. But even they have to be very forgiving of the effects of age on Collins' once crystalline voice."
4,Angel of 60's Returns,"Few voices in American popular music are recognizable from just a few sung notes - Judy Collins has one of those voices. The passage of time (some 40 years) has not dulled the lilt on this angel. Collins is in fine form, as usual. Moving, melodic and spiritual this CD is sure to enrapture. The arrangements are superb and that voice delivers as sure as a spring breeze on a warm day. Standouts include the very touching ""I Can't Cry Hard Enough"" and a rollicking and folksy ""Sally Go 'Round the Roses"". Only quibble: The spoken ""Lincoln Portrait"" is a distraction from the otherwise splendid singing. Here's hoping Ms. Collins has many more recordings in the wings."
3,"A Disappointed, Yet Hopeful Fan","I have been in love with Judy Collins for over 30 years, so when I saw this new CD of her own material, I was excited. However, as much as I tried to like all her songs, they were uneven and somewhat repetitious. Her voice, that sweet, unerring, pure soprano is still remarkably the same as it was years ago (contrast her voice with Joni Mitchell's that has dropped an octave or more), but on certain songs, her pitch seems off and her phrasing is not self-assured. My favorite song on the album is the a cappella ""Wedding Song"" but even that song becomes tedious after awhile. Judy Collins invented and perfected the ""art song,"" a classically arranged popular song with complex poetic lyrics. The album ""Wildflowers"" is an extraordinary example of this genre. Judy Collins is brave soul, a trouper, who continues to grace our lives with her talent. Unfortunately, it is because she was so good that this album suffers by comparison."
3,Improve Your Health,Great reference book. Gave me a lot of insight as I faced the road to cancer treatment options.
1,Horrible customer service!!!!,"right out of the box, our remote didn't work nor the autoprogram button (which is imperative to tune in to the local channels). We tried the customer service number on the back of the warranty and waited 3 days in a row for at least an hour each time. After finally getting through to someone, the customer service rep. was very rude and not helpful at all. He told us someone would contact us to set up a time to fix the t.v and a week later still no one has called us back. STEER CLEAR OF THIS BRAND!!!"
4,The price was right...,"If you purchased it on sale, then it was a steal. If you paid the normal listed price one sees all over the Web, then you might feel ripped off. The picture quality is 6.5/10, it took me about 5hrs to get the picture just right. DVD's on a non-progressive unit look excellent, rich in contrast, good shadow. Football/baseball were a little dissapointing (I have DirecTV) with some fuziness around graphics/yard lines. I am watching it only 4-5 feet away, it would probably look excellent further away. For those concerned about the horiz. lines, let the tubes warm up for a constant 24hrs... my disappeared after a while and unless you are extremely picky, you will be very satisfied. I'm not too concerned about the quality, I own a Apex 20inch and 3 DVD players, all have been working 110%!"
4,Good for the money,"just got this TV delivered by Eagle USA. Delivery was smooth but the guy don't install. So beware.Overall, the appearance of the TV is handsome. I like the silver/chrome finish on the exterior. The size of this TV is just perfect for our master bedroom corner. Setup is very simple. Just a few click and u are up. The numeric channel button is a bit confusion. In order to change to station in the 10's or 100's, u need to press the 100+ button on the remote to switch to that mode. Otherwise, the TV is good for what I paid for it."
2,"Pretty cheapo TV, buy it for your 2 year old.","So I go the TV deliver, and it wound't power up. I called up Apex support, which in turn referred to me a local warranty place. I called them, and a tech came out who couldn't fix it on site, so they took it to their shop. They had it for a month and a half, waiting for parts. I finally got the TV back, and it was working, but the convergence was crappy, and picture quality is sub-par. If you fix the convergence and turn the TV off, the next time you turn it on the convergence will be off again. Save your money and invest in a 16:9 widescreen HDTV with a DVI interface, so you won't have to buy another TV in 1 year."
1,Not just the TV but Customer Service is horrible too,"I bought this TV through Amazon last week. Was delivered in time but ever since it is having convergence problem. I have tried to fix it through menu but it keeps getting corrupt on it own, anytime it feels like. Amazon does not want to take ownership of this TV, being too big. Apex customer service says contact our service center and service center says they are waiting for an approval! Can anyone imagine that Apex customer service phone is down for past two days? I guess I have to live with this. But now, I can NEVER suggest anyone to buy anything from APEX ever again. Also, read amazon's return policy before buying such items. I made a mistake I did not read it."
1,defective,"I hate this unit, or maybe I'm biased because it came defective. When I turn it on, the closed captioning has a double vision background of purple. The pictures are not clear. Thank god for Apex warranty. I called them up and they told me they would send a technician over by next week to replace the defective part, which they guessed was the converter. Also, the panel in front of the tv is very hard to close. Push, and it opens, push again and it's supposed to close, but it doesnt, then u realize you have to push harder to close it. I`ll keep you updated on the picture quality after they send the technician over here..."
1,Not worth the money.,Let's List the good things first:-size-hi definition-priceAnd now the bad:-No screen protector-No anti-glare covering-Poor contrast-The buttons on the remote do not work or do a function other than what they are labeled. For instance hitting the volume on mine brings up the sleep timer.-Tinny sound despite BBE sound enhancement.Should have known better than to buy an APEX. For a bit more money a higher end TV of a major brand name is a much better investment.
3,unlucky maybe?,I purchased one of these apex gb4308 tv's. the first one i bought i had to return becouse it kept shuting off buy it self for no reason. the store was nice and they exchanged it for me. a 240 mile trip i might add. now the second one i have now was working good for a while great picture and sound. but now the upper tuner is going out very fussy pictures from channels 55 and up. i called the rex store where i bought it to see if i could get it repaired. they told me they don't have anyone who will work on apex. just return it and we give another one. i hope every one else has better luck with this television then i do.
2,"Sure, it is cheap, but quality justifies the price","I have own one of these for about 1 year now. When I first I got it, I was really happy. a big tv for less than $600 bucks. After I used it for 1 month, it stopped working. No image. Trying to find customer service number, took forever, but finally find it somewhere hidden. Called, took forever, and got one of local authorized repair center to pick up the tv. After 2 weeks of repair, got it back. Ever since, I have little problem here and there, but still exceptable, afterall, I only pay less than $600 for this. I would not buy another Apex tv. Quality is really bad in my opionion. Out of focus in the corners, color is off, and unstable sound."
2,BASICALLY YOU ARE BUYING A TV FOR ONE YEAR,"I got this tv, well the 51"" GB-5108 version, (same thing), and up until today I have been extatic. Got it for 588 on a supersale last Nov, the black friday weekend. Got it delivered a few times because the first two sets weren't good. After that fiasco I was pleased with a large cheap tv with a great picture quality. Now a year has gone by and the convergence has suddenly been all messed up. Based upon reviews of these tvs, this will happen on just about all of them after 6 months to a year. If it lasts more than that, you got the needle in the haystack. Get the warranty, you will need it. Expect your tv to break on a moments notice. Honestly, KNOWING that the tv will break, you are probably better off investing in a better unit. Or buy this one cheap, get a warranty and expect to fix it every few months. Your choice."
1,What a Christmas!,"I bought an APEX television for me and my husband for Xmas. Within six weeks the TV went out and from that day on our lives have not been the same. APEX CS is HORRIBLE!! They have given us every song and dance known to man. We bought ours from Fingerhut and neither one of them will help. The two service people they told us to call for APEX do not service my area. APEX says they are only 10 miles from my home and one is 50, the other 40. That's ONE WAY! We had to buy another TV (RCA). We are now having to store the APEX TV and my credit is kaput because of APEX. Fingerhut said they would take it back within six months but I would have to pay shipping of $72. I would throw myself in front of one of these TV's in a store to keep someone from buying one and have the headaches that we have experienced."
2,shadow in screen,my set was setup 8/31/03 problem with a shadow box lower half of the screen.will call for tec.help.
3,not bad for the price,"Had this tv for 4 years and I can't complain, considering how inexpensive it was. 480P is a little too dark. And the bottom inch of the screen gets cut off."
5,Best value for the price,"I bought it at amazon.com two months ago to replace my Sony Wega 27"". Very happy with it.Some people mentioned it was too dark for progressive scan DVD player, but I don't have this problem. The picture is bright and clear."
1,TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT,"The item that I ordered was shipped to me in 2 wks. I opened the box after delivery with an excitement and guess what I got? A defective tv. And from that day on I am constantly in contact with the service and amazon but the service will tell me they ordered the part but Apex isnt sending it, and Apex wont even respond. The worst product ever. Total waste of your money. I would pay a couple of hundred bucks more and get a working tv from a reliable brand like Toshiba, Sony, RCA, long story short DONT BUY APEX!"
1,misconception,"This set is advertised as a ""high definition"" television.Reading the tech details does let you know that it is a EDTV capable of only 480P. Minimum HDTV requires at least a 720p.Actual HDTV has a resolution of 1920 x 1080. Also, it looks terrible.A majority of people have no clue about HDTV and are constantlygiven incorrect information."
1,Don't Bother - Get Another Brand!,"We have had our TV for a little over a year. After the first month we had to call Apex for service, well none of their contracted centers would come to our area. So finally after a couple of weeks of back and forth and hours on hold the the store we purchased from replaced our set with an identical model. Then about 10 months after the new set will turn itself off and back on again - for no apparant reason! We did get a technician out this time, but after replacing the whole circuit board it is worse than before. Now it just turns off, and you have to turn it back on yourself! Forget trying to watch a movie, you miss half the plot turning the set back on!I do not recommend this set to anyone! I only give it one star because they don't allow us to post negative stars!"
4,HAPPY CUSTOMER,"I just received my order and I really like the 43"" tv. Has a great picture and quality sound. As for amazon, they did an excellent job on my order as well as eagle shipping. I will continue to shop at amazon!"
3,"great item, bad support","The item was delivered quite nicely. Unpackaged and placed in my home exactly where I desired. For the first 24 hours I was like a child on Christmas morning. However, the picture is showing distortion, and I can't get support from Apex CS. The picture fluctuates from dark to bright sporadically. I finally got through to Apex CS, and was told a technician would contact me within 72 hours. A week later that hasn't happened. Their toll free number is always busy. I am sure it is a simple fix...however I am not sure if I will ever find out as the tech wizard won't come out from behind the curtain."
1,Not for dark paints.,"I purchased this product and applied it to the top and hood of a two year old black paint finish. The paint was clean and gloossy, thinking it would protect them better as the are succeptable to the most damage. In a matter of days both areas began to develop a milky white look that was impossible to wash off. The rest of the truck was ok where I dint apply the polish. I contacted their headquarters and explained what was happening. They told me they dont recommend this product on black finishes! What??? And what I was seeing was heavy oxidation. They told me I had to use rubbing compound to remove the damage. I ended up taking my truck to a detail shop and $300 bucks to restore the finish. There should be a warning on the bottle for dark finishes."
4,"Easy, Affordable, Durable","Car waxes seem to come with sizzle and hype. I don't think Nu Finish lasts a whole year, but it's worked well for me and does well in independent tests.PROs:* More durable than other liquid waxes according to Consumer Reports (Nov 2011)* Inexpensive (see Pricing below)- Easy to apply- Good shelf life (see Note 1)CONs:- Not as durable as some paste waxes- - - Alternatives - - -Nu Finish Paste Car PolishorTurtle Wax T-465 8 Oz Ice Polish Paste- - - Pricing - - -Amazon price swings mostly between 7 and 11. Wal-Mart has it for under 9. There's an ""Online Price Alert"" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done. Or try camemcamelcamel.- - - Notes - - -Note 1: Shelf life: I have bottles of Nu Finish and also Zymol from about 6 years ago. The Zymol is separated into thin liquid and grainy chunks -- hard to re-homogenize, but the Nu Finish is perfectly good."
4,"nothing extra ordinary about it, but it works.","by watching the commercial and taking into considerations the positive reviews of this product made me buy one today at autozone same price with amazon, following the instructions and apply it on my 1 year old car one section section at a time my car is slightly shiny but when i apply it on my 12 year old well kept car i see a big improvement."
5,The Real Deal,"In short: Nu-finish is the real deal. I recently purchased a 20-year old vehicle that had been left in the sun for past six years and poorly maintained. With the first wash and application of this polish, the former deep gloss came back in an amazing way. Not that it looks like a new car, but the transformation in the paint's appearance is startling.In addition, Nu-finish was applied in the middle of day, under the hot Caribbean sun. It made nary a difference. There was no white residue left on the body of the car, but a bit on the trim. I could care less, however.I'm ecstatic with the performance of this product, and heartily recommend it."
2,Didn't work for me...,"I've used this polish on my black Nissan. Honestly, there was no difference between the polished and unpolished side. Most likely it is becuase my car at the time was 4 years old and the paint was not in great shape. A previous poster says that the website for the makers of the polish says to use oxidation remover. Maybe that is why the results were not so great. It is correct that it does say to use oxidation remover on the bottle (the main reason why I rated it so low).On a side not, POLISH and WAX are not the same thing. Those words should not be used interchangably. A lot of reviews mix those words up horribly. Wax is what you do to your car AFTER you polish it. The description of the Nu Finish Polish even says that there is no wax in it."
2,Hard time getting it off!,Applied in garage (in shade) after washing 08 BMW 328i Coupe. Had a hard time getting it off. It leaves little spots of powder on car that you practically have to use your finger nail to get off. Very frustrating. Better paying someone else to do car instead of torturing yourself with this product.
2,Not impressed . . .,Doesn't penetrate as deeply as paste wax. I was not impressed with this product and will not be buying it again.
2,Not as advertising,"It's far less quality than other brand such as Meguiar's Canauba Wax. Leave a lot of residues on your car after 3 weeks of application. If you wax under sunny weather as it's advertised, you will have hard time to buff it off."
5,Dickens!,"You can get a lot of the individual Dickens novels for free on Kindle, but if you want to have some of the lesser known books, this is an affordable option. I am happy with the purchase."
4,Wonderful Dickens,"Like Shakespeare, Dickens brings the nature of human frailty front screen.This edition could have been better displayed. It is a feast."
4,Can't go wrong!,"I purchased this about a month ago and, of course, I've had time to read only a small portion of it. But at 99 cents for the Complete Works of Dickens, how could it not be a worthwhile purchase? I bought this particular edition because other reviewers noted the comprehensive table of contents with chapter-level linking (essential in a collection like this) and the reproductions of the Victorian-era illustrations, which enhance Dickens' already vivid writing. While I haven't yet completed reading a full book, the experience has been very satisfactory. As for the content, what's not to like? It's Dickens, one of the best writers in the English language!"
2,hard to navigate,I am fairly new to e-books but found this one very hard to navigate. Index was hard to find - link from selected book to the actual book didn't work. It is a huge collection but hard to move around in.
5,Cannot believe the amount of content for the tiny price!,"This compilation is excellent. The inclusion of the illustrations is key to any Dickens reprint or collection, and this one has them all. I also have enjoyed reading the critical reviews by Dicken's contemporaries - not everyone was a fan. It reminded me of any modern pop-icon who just by the fact of being so popular find themselves under fire by more ""serious"" intellectuals.There are other works included that were not mainstream, along with biographies, along with, well, a ton! Having this genius's life works and so much related content about him all on one slim, ergonomic device like my Kindle Fire is a dream come true."
3,Hard to access the content,"Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors. I have read several of his novels, and I assumed they are all contained in this book. However, I had been unable to find them, since there is no list of them in the contents. There is one for his short stories and his plays; but none for his novellas, collaborative works, his plays, his non-fiction, the adaptations, criticisms or biographies--although clicking the GO TO button tells me they are all there. After much difficulty, however, I finally discovered where the book's table of contents was: It is right after the cover. I would have found it sooner, but at least on my PaperWhite Kindle you cannot click on the cover unless your search originates there! The only way I found was to GO TO the Beginning, then BACK UP several pages until--voila! We come to the table of contents! Why I can't just GO TO the table of contents is beyond me. Anyway, the content gets a 5, the access TO it gets a 1, so it averages out to a 3. Too bad!"
5,Complete Works of Charles Dickens,Dickens set the fiction standard for his times. His writings are still relevant in modern times. It is good to recall how our fore-bearers lived. His works brought about improvements in the standard of living of the poor.
4,newly revised and improved,"** Updated review: After being in contact with the publisher, the publisher has worked diligently to correct some of the mistakes I noticed (which I listed below) and has released a much improved version. The publisher has provided me with a new and improved file and I therefore am revising my rating upward on account of these improvements. Impressive response from the publisher to make a nice product!Sorry, but this product does not deserve a 5-star rating. It is impressive the amount of material contained herein and some of the illustrations may be appealing. However, there are glaring misspelling, grammar, and formatting errors. Do you want a ton of material from this author all in one place for a low price with some nice illustrations? Then get this Delphi version. If you're someone who cares about reading an author's authentic words without overt spelling, grammar, and formatting errors, then you probably need to look elsewhere for a more scholarly edition."
2,series compressed into a movie...,"I really hate it when they take half of a series compress the hell out of it add a new opening and closing scene, and market it as a new movie.That is exactly what this is, just now you get it as Ryuk telling the story to another death god.I felt cheated & ripped off for paying for this. Death Note was such a great story it was all the details that made it so enjoyable and they turned it into a half-assed movie for the patience impaired hooping to turn an extra buck. At least the live action movies took it in a different direction."
3,"I hate to say it, but...","...I was quite disappointed w/this DVD.First, the good stuff: The animation of the new scenes is lovely; the colors & design are brighter and crisper than in the original anime. It's really the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. The extra scenes are interesting, but don't add that much to the original series.OK, now the bad stuff: This is basically a clip show, following just over halfway thru the anime (where a particularly lovable character dies). It's framed by Ryuk telling the story to another shinigami. But that's about it.I'd had high hopes for this DVD (given the description), but, alas, they were dashed [siiiiigh].I'd recommend this for (a) Death Note completists, or (b) someone who doesn't want to invest the time in watching the entire first half of the original anime."
3,reads like a lecture,"Very difficult to digest; not the topic, but the style of writing. It reads more like a compilation of lecture notes from a college professor intended for aspiring psychoanalysts interested in mythology and the relationship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. Not all bad, I did glean some interesting information from this book; but, wow, it took some determination to finish it."
3,It took forever to get here,It took forever to get to my house it was a present for a friend and got here days later and (did not want to pay the extra money for expedite shiping)
3,"Nice timer, poor temperature gauge","I've had this thermo-timer for over four years now, and it makes a great timer. The temperature gauge failed after about two months of use, and I haven't used it for that purpose since. Now I use the timer in my classroom every day, and it keeps time in a consistent, reliable manner."
3,A bit underwhelmed,"Well, the price is right, but the results are not so much. I have seen these look great with clear cases, but this does not do a whole lot for a stock case. The LEDs themselves are not terribly bright, and you will NOT achieve the results in Talismoon's pictures unless you play in total darkness and have color enhancing vision.These can however look somewhat cool in a stock case if you put some real time and effort into exact placement, and the room lighting is low...In the end you get what you pay for: a so-so LED kit. If you are going to buy one, just do yourself a favor and get two instead- so you can illuminate the vents on both the top and bottom of the case, as one kit in only enough to do 2 of the 4 vents."
5,"Comprehensive, Readable, Enlightening, Important","This book weaves together several important and somewhat familiar stories in a startlingly new and brilliant way. We know that music and dance exploded in powerful new forms in the 1930s. And we know the ""streamlined"" and ""futuristic"" themes of techno-optimism dominated other cultural expressions in the 1930s. And we know there was a current of ""techno-anxiety"" that expressed itself in everything from Chaplin films to the Frankfurt School. But Joel Dinerstein has shown that these phenomena intimately informed each other. We will never view early-20th century American culture the same way after this book. Buy it. Read it. Assign it to your students. It should win many major awards."
4,Freak The Mighty,The book Freak The Mighty by Rodman Philbrick is exciting and at the same time devestating. The exciting part was when Killer Kane got arrested. The devestating part was when Freak (Kevin) died and Freak The Mighty was no more. I would recommend this book to other people because I want the people to read this book so they can feel the joy of this book.
3,good book,i think this is a good boook for kids and it is kind of a sad book. it is a book about freind ship adventure. i think you should read it
1,OH JEEEESSSS!!!!!,This one of those book's where your teacher's touched by the beauty and love this book brings while your shooting spit balls at the kid in front of you .This book was written for teachers to like and have students torture into reading.It's so unrealistic what kid would start chanting Freak the Mgihty in the middle of everyone and not get jawed in the face.He's so annoynig with his love for Robot's while Maz doesn't shut his yap about howe stupid and big he is while he's actually smart deep down inside but he likes to pretend he's stupid like shawn hunter from bopy meets world.How corny a kid who thinks hes a kngiht in shiny armor when truly he's just a book worm midget!
4,NO BOOK YET,"I have not even received this book yet and I can't get a hold of anyone who can tell me where it's at!! The charge is on my credit bill, but I haven't gotten the book yet!"
4,great book,"I enjoyed readign Freak the Mighty.It was like no other book I have read.This book expressed humor,action,adventure,empathy,love,and friendship in many different ways.Every chapter was poignant and suspenful that I had a desire to to not to stop reading.I admired Freaks creativity,and imagination;he sort of changed the story from a normal regular version to a more perplexed fantasy version consisting of dragons and knights.The character Max was also a stable character with distinct characteristics,I enjoyed the way max spoke his mind about different things this really gave me an insight on how Max thinks and feels.Two good qualities the author put in this writing was the use of dialect and descriptive words, these helped me to perceive a picture in my mind of what a character is like so far as looks,feelings,smells,etc."
4,Riding High,"I think Freak the Mighty is a never-ending tale of adventures. I recently read the book ""Just Ella"" and nothing, I mean nothing can compare to that book, but Freak the Mighty was close. I thought it was hard to read out loud because of all the slang, run-ons, and other ways that the author used to write the story. I think that this book was funny when Max was walking to the hospital and an old man was mowing his lawn in his pajamas. Trust me you'll love this book! That's why I rate this book with four stars"
3,Freak The Mighty,Freak The Mighty was a kind of cool book but at the same time it was boring. But I think that in some parts it was imtresting. And the characters were out of the ordinary. And the story seemed like a real story. And I think a lot of kids could relate to Maxwell because theirs a lot of kids who get punked and don't have any friends. Then they finally meet somebod and next thing you know thier friend goes away or smething happens.
5,Awesome read!,"This book was awesome, and it was one of the best books i have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read books. I love how the little boy Kevin wasn't the strongest person but he was strong willed and Maxwell was a guy who was a very kind person and he would do anything for Freak. I liked how the story was very funny at some parts and sad at some parts. I haven't read the next one but I am sure it will be very good just like this one. That is why I gave this book 5 stars."
4,Good book!,"I'm really glad that our teacher had us read this book. I thought it was a very interesting book. I really liked Freak. He was a pretty funny kid. I was really surprised when Max's father came and got him. That was very scary, I would be so scared if that happened to me. I was also surprised at what Loretta did. That was very brave. It was a good ending too."
5,Stick Up For Friends,"True friends stick up for each other. In the book Freak the Mighty by Rodman Philbrick, Kevin was a brave friend because he helped Max even though it was hard for him. Even Lorretta and Iggy saved Max from Killer Kane. Max helped Freak escape from Tony.D in so many different ways."
5,Friendship,"In the story Freak The Mighty by Rodman Philbrick, Is about Friendship, like: How Freak and Max solve problems quickly than one alone and they care for each other like real friends should be, Lots of times they have a lot of things in common that they don't notice themselves. Freak and Max are always taking care of each other no matter what happens, Another thing is Freak and Max are not always innocent there quite evil!"
4,The Great Book,"Freak The Mighty, by Rodman Fhilbrick is about these two boys that become best friends. their names are Maxwell and Kevin. they called Maxwell Max and Kevin Freak. Freak was a boy with a small body and was smart. Max was a tall boy but not as smart as Freak.I would recommend this book to a friend because I thought it was funny. I thought it was funny because I thought that it was a funny part when Freak squirted Killer Kane with water but making him think it was H2SO4 and supposly making him go blind.The thing that I liked about the book was that it had some action. I like some books that have action because for me books or movies that have action are fun. One part in the book that had action was when the cops were chasing Max in the hospital and hand cuffed him."
2,Book Review,"The book, Freak The Mighty, by Rodman Philbrick is a pretty good book. This book is funny and entertaining by their actions and thoughts. It shows how can a person do many things even by their hight. This book has some really good characters ome is Freak the other one is Max. This two characters are really good friends.Until Ftreak dies. This book shows alot of good things maybe that they had happen to you in life or in the future. This is a book that a person would never forget?why? because this book shows alot of stuff in life and is a pretty good book. I racomend for people to read it or buy it !!!!"
4,Great Book!,This book was very good. I liked how Max always stood up for Freak and how they helped each other out in surviving in their world. They always helped each other get through tough situations. I like the book very much and I would reccomend this book to alot of kids who like to read books and enjoy a great story.
5,Freak The Mighty,"I really liked the book Freak the Mighty. I would recommend the book to my friends. I give it 5 stars. I laughed out loud when I listened to the tapes. I liked the name of Max's grandparents Gram & Grim. I knew that Max's Dad was in jail but was surprised when he got out and kidnapped Max. Fortunately, the cops caught him and Max went back to his life. Two thumbs up from ""B"" for this book."
3,FRIENDSHIP,"Friends stick up for each other and don't use each other for their things. You will find this information in the book Freak The Mighty by Rodman Philbrick. Also you can find this information in other friendship books that includes sticking up for each other, and that don't use friends for their things."
3,Bravery times,"Sometimes the scaredest people become the bravest this is heard in the book Freak the Mighty written Rodman Philbrick. Max became brave because of Freak, together they became Freak the mighty he knew he wasn't going to live very long, and I became brave."
4,FRIENSHIP,"Friends help each other and care about each other. Friends helpeach other in many ways. Good friends are brave. Friends work together to get things done. The title of this book is ""Freak the Mighty"". It's written by Rodmen Philbrick.COMMENT BY:RACHEL E. HERNANDEZ"
4,bravery,"People can overcome huge challenges with the help of others. Freak was so strong, active and brave knowing from the age of seven that he was not going to live for very long. So he took advantage and lived his life to the fullest with his new best friend Max. Together they went on adventures. Max's challenge was he was kidnapped by his father Killer Kane. Freak comes and saves Max."
3,waverlycourtney,"Freak the Mighty was on okay book. It was about Kevin, who they call Freak, and Maxwell, and their adventure in life. They quickly become friends and start to enjoy life.This book could have been written a little better.In the book they refer to a certain part of town as ""The Testaments"". I find this offensive due to my beliefs. I also didn't like that the book skipped around a lot. I would have liked more detail. Along with a little more action. Finally I say that there be more in the book, since it is a very short book.I gave this book three starts because of what I thought of it. To recap, the book was very short, I find some parts offensive, and there is a lot of skipping around. I would not recommend this book to a friend. Unless they are looking for a quick and boring read."
3,enjoyable but boring at times,My daughter read this as an assignment for class.... she found it interesting but not something she wouldcheck out of the library if she had a choice.
3,Freak the Mighty,"Freak the Mighty is a great book about courage and friendship. If you're looking for a book with adventures then you got to read this book.Freak the Mighty is about 2 kids called Freak (Kevin) and Max. Freak and Max fist meet when they're very small in a Day Care Center. Then, they meet again in the 6th grade where they have lots of adventures. One day, they make a name for them self Freak the Mighty, freak for Kevin and mighty for Max. Everything was going great until Max's dad Killer Kane comes in town to get Max and take him with him. Now, freak has to find Max to save their friendship.I won't tell you the ending because you need to read it to believe it."
4,Freak The Mighty-GREAT,"This story is about a boy named Kevin, whom everyone calls Freak because he was deformed. Kevin was friends with Max, a giant who had a learning disabilty. They helped each other. Max was their legs and Kevin was their brains. The two of them were good friends, who had many bad and good times together. The story kept my interest to the end. GREAT!"
3,Freak the Mighty (...),"Freak the Mighty was a good book that I read. The two main characters Max and Kevin aka Freak were very advengerous. They both liked going on adventures. Really Freak was happy about all the adventures probably since he did not have to walk. Freak would travel on Max's shoulder since Freak was kind of slow since he had those type of crutches with him. Blade was like the villian in the story. He and his gang would like to cause trouble everywhere. Max's dad, Kenny Kane was a killer. Everyone called him Killer Kane. Freak's dad was a magician and when he heard the magic words birth defect he vanished. When Freak was born he had this disease that like every 300 kids would get. It's when your skin stops growing and your organs do. Max had not really much a disease but it seemed as though his outside kept growing faster then his insides mostly his brains. (...) Max had done his best to work hard in school andtry to imagine what the story is like in his head."
1,stinkadink,i did not like the book because it got me confused. it was so boring. i felt asleep when i was reading the book. the characters got me cofuse wih everybody. it did not have any action.
1,Freak the Boring,I did not like Freak the Mighty.It was so boring did not like the writing style of the arother. First he was in the preschool and then Max was 12.Freak was made out to be so sarmt. One question if he was so smart way wasn't he in sail. And they made Max out to be stupid did not like Freak the Mighty.It was so boring did not like the writing style of the arother. First he was in the preschool and then Max was 12.Freak was made out to be so sarmt. One question if he was so smart way wasn't he in sail. And they made Max out to be stuip. But way didn't he flunks you can tell I thought it was boring. I almost fell asleep. But way didn't he flunk.
4,This book ROCKS!,"This book was magnificient!!! I have never read a novel so exciting and full of pleasant and unpleasant experiences. You would never have guessed the ending. Even though I don't prefer sad stories, this one brought a great point around. When Max gets taken hostage by his so-called father, ""Killer Kane"" I thought he was never going to return. Then Freak saves the day by finding them in a broken down building. This book is excellent proof that two is better than one, and I highly recommend it to any reader!!!!!!"
3,Good read for young adults - nothing earth shattering,"This was a good book to read with young adults. The story was compelling, but some of the characters were a bit predictable. Interesting discussion themes and a nice, easy read."
5,Great coming-of-age novel,"A great young adult coming-of-age novel - especially for boys, I think. Freak (Kevin), a dwarf, and Max, extremely tall, are at once an unlikely and yet perfect match. Their friendship and reliance on one another has a child-like innocence and devotion that is very appealing. The story, told through Max's voice never allows us to feel pity for the characters. We do however, cheer their resilience and strength."
4,Freak the Mighty,"This book was a great adventure about two boys who had difficulties and together worked them out in a special way. They, together, were a great team. We, first meet Max. Max is a boy of about 12 years of age. Max has learning difficulties and is in a learning disabled class. Kevin or Freak is about the same age as Max. Kevin is crippled and has to use crutches to get around all the time. When they meet they quickly become friends.My favorite adventure in this book is when Max and Kevin are in a park on the 4th of July and Kevin is naming the chemicals in the fireworks before they have to escape from Tony D. and his gang. They end up jumping into a millpond with Kevin on Max's shoulders, of course. This book has a sad ending but its worth reading."
2,Freak The Mighty,"I didn't really like Freak The Mighty. I would have to rate it a two. I actually thought that the storyline wasn't that bad, with the idea of Freak & Max complementing each other's weaknesses and all. But, the storyline & characters were also just a little too weird for me. I would have liked it if Freak & Max could have gone separate ways."
4,My 10 year old nephew(s) love this book!,"My nephew and I read this book together, we laughed, we cried, we didn't want it to end. This is a wonderful book for boys, the level of honesty is sometimes hurtful but necessary for the story to be so touching. This is my 4th purchase for a 4th nephew/friend!"
4,Freak the Mighty,"I love the book, Freak the Mighty, it has a variety of feelings that it gives me, happy, sad, scary, humorous,emotional and a lot more! The author, Rodman Philbrick, uses such detail to desribe the charecters. It seems like I'm right there, in the story, with Freak and Max. I think that if you have a chance to read this unique book, then you should."
5,what a super book!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a book that deserves 5 stars totally with its great ending, great beginning and all around great book to read and enjoy for all ages. This book is about a kid named Max that is unbelievable humongous and towers over everyone in the neighborhood that he lives in. One day he sees a disabled kid that he calls Freak. So as Freak and Max become closer together in their friendship they encounter some bullies, which they eventually stop, bothering them in many humorous ways. They run into a lake at a carnival, which is all muddy and goopy, and Freak and Max get stuck in it and the same happens with Blade and his gang. This book has a really surprise ending that none of you would probably know about. This is why I'm encouraging you to read this book and you will be surprised on what a good... no great story this book is."

4,"""FRIENDSHIPS""","I loved the book Freak the Mighty. It was a very inspiring story. I like the way the author made it seem like he was Max. Freak and Max have a relationship that cannot be explained. Sometimes I felt bad for Max, but with Freak, I knew that Max was O.K. I really liked the character of Gram because she was always trying to make Max feel better on the inside. I also liked Freak because he pushed Max to his hardest do to good in school, and to read and write. He really built up Max' s confidence. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes stories about tough times and a good strong friendship."

5,freak the mighty,"This is such a great book. It had so many adventures that freak the mighty went through. My favorite part of the book was when they met. I thought it was very unexpected that they became best friends becaus when they met max said that freak was the only kid that had intimidated him, and considering the size freak is that seems a little off. But I only think thats because freak was one of the only kids that that was scared of max so that also scared max."

5,"The book was amazing ""Mate""",I really like the character of Freak the Mighty because in the story he acts like he is really doing this in the story with Max. It was funny when Max acted like Kevin's house was a castle. The character reminds me of my baby cousin. She likes to roam around the house and play. I would reommend this book to kids in middle school. the reason my class liked this book was because it was very interesting. The book was definitely excellent for ages 9-12.
3,Freak the mighy ( my review),I really like the charather of Loretta Lee because she eats pizza all the time. Another reason I like her because she had the guts to save a young boy from a wanted killer. The part I thought was funny was when they would act up together. I would probly recomend this book to people who like action movies and books. I would also reccemed this book to people who also like sad movies and books. This book tought me to be thankful for your people and friends because one day they'll be gone and you'll never get them back. The style of the book was pretty cool because it seeems pretty cool. -John or Jane Doe
3,Freak The Mighty,"I thought the book,""Freak the Mighty"" was good. It was about two best friends named Freak and Max. Freak's real name is Kevin. Max has a learning disorder and Freak is short and amall. Freak moves in next to Max and they become best friends. They both have adventures and fun together.I would rate this book about 3 stars. The author of this book dida good job doing imagery and descriptive writing. I recommend this book to readers that like friendship stones. So when you get time check out,"" freak the Mighty,"" it's a great book."
4,A sad but funny novel. Shows true friendship.,"I thought that this book was one of the best I have ever read. This book is about a large boy named Max, and his best friend Freak. This book was so enjoyable, I read the last 100 pages in one night!"
5,IT'S THE BOM,This book is about two kid's. Kevin ''Freak''and Maxwell ''Max''.This two boy's were best friend's untill kevin's disease kill's him. Max has to live with the thought that he just lost his best friend. This was a realy great book and I think any one could read this great book.
1,Freak The Mighty,this book was so boring i fell asleep with my eyes wide open.Any way the movie wasso cool some parts.
2,Freak The Mighty,"I didn't like the book Freak The Mighty. I just like it at all. It was a book that I never would have read if it weren't for our class Literature Circle. I didn't like it because it was a book that didn't have a good plot, and it jumps around alot."

4,Read This Book,"Freak The Mighty, by Rodman Phil Brick,is about two boys one was named Maxwell and the other was named kevin. They called kevin freak and maxwell was called kicker. Kevin had a disaese called Molquiro syndrome,BUT Together they become FREAK THE MIGHTY. I recomend this book because it is very interesting to read it is also very sad but it is a good book."
3,read this book!,"Freak The Mighty,by Rodman Philbrick,this book is about 2 kids and their are Freak and Mighty.And other characters called lorreta,fair gwen,and Killer Kane.And also killer kane killed mightys mom"
4,some parts of the book are boring,"the only cool parts are when freak says funny comments, like when he made fun of blade and his crew. some parts made me crack up like when he said he used good old h2so4.if i where max kane i would sock blade right in the face and wait until he starts crying."
3,SOME PARTS ARE COOL AND BORING,THIS BOOK IS NICE AND SAD BECAUSE FREAK DIES.PEOPLE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.IT'S INTRESTING SAD AND SOME CLUES TO SOLVE.THERES INTRESTING CHARACTERS AND SOME ARE LIKE SHAPES.THERES MAX HE'S QUIET.FREAK BIG MOUTH.KILLA KANE EVIL MURDERER.I GIVE THIS BOOK **** STARS BECAUSE THIS BOOK REALLY INSPIRED ME AND MAYBE IT WELL INSPIRE YOU
4,my point of view,"I thought that Freak the mighty was a good book it really shows the point of view of one teenage mind and how one young person can change another young persons life. This book shows the many harsh realitys of life yet it still throws some imagination in there to keep the book intresting. This book is great for people all over to read at any age it woll help adults understand pre teens and teens while at the same time helping young adults understand each other a little better. It helps them understand that they should not always put themselves first and to let the other person be in the center of attention every now and then. Young adults should definitely read this book so that they learn how to become better freinds which will help the entire American society, in my point of view."
5,Freak The Mighty,"Freak The Mighty was a very enjoyable book because it captivated me right from the beginning. The book talks about how two people who were different from one another, became great friends. I didn't like how the book ended, but the rest of the book was great. I would highly recommend this book if you like funny but sad books."
4,Nick's reveiw,"I would recomend this book to people who like to readbooks that are funny yet serious. This book has lots of different emotions, sad, happy, scared, and mad are some. Freak the Mighty is a adventurest book. The quests of Freak are the best. I would really recomend this book."
4,Freak the Mighty is totally cool!,"Freak the Mighty was a very good book. The book is about two of the most unlikely set of friends you could imagine. Max, a giant kid who really dosn't have any friends becouse of his size, meets Kevin. Kevin is a boy with a serious growth problem, that is the first friend Max ever had. Everywhere Max and Kevin go they are Freak the Mighty. My favorite part of the book is when Freak the Mighty is born at the lake. I would recomend this book to everyone!"
4,Freak The Mighty Like Totally Rox Dude!!!!,"This is a very exciting book. This is a scary and heart-warming book. Max and Kevin become friends and go on many adventures and quests. They run away from bullies, rescue someone's purse and go many other places. Kevin is a cripple, but is very smart. Max is hubigeous and smart but is also very lazy when it comes to school work. These two completely different people, in a way, combined together to make one great person. A tragic event happens at Kevin's 13th birthday. If you want to know more read this book. I loved the end of this book. The first part was okay, but it got better. I know you will love it. AWESOME O WOWS LIKE TOTALLY FREAK THE MIGHTY WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ~"
5,Beautiful!,"This book has been one of the most memorable books that I have ever read. I have already read it three times in a row. Definitely a keeper! Freak the Mighty has everything from humor, knights in shining armor, to sadness and friendship. Love that book!"
5,great,This book is the best and interasting book i have ever read. You should read this book. This book is one of a kind. You will cry and laugh at the same time.
4,THE GOODIES,"The book Freak the Mighty is an enjoyable book to read. This book is so interesting. In the book there was one main character, his name was Max. He gets kidnapped by his dad who has been in jail for several years. He has been in jail for keeling his wife. His wife was Max mom. Max was present when the murdering was going on. To learn more read Freak the Mighty."
3,Freindship,"A friend never leaves your side. In Freak the Mighty by Rodman PhilBricks, Max carried Freak on his shoulder's. Also Freak and Max went every where together. Finally Freak and Max cared for each other."
5,Live for Today!,"People should appreciate every day they have because you never know what is going to happen tomorrow. In Freak the Mighty, Rodman Philbrick teaches readers this very lesson through the friendship of two very different boys, Kevin and Max. Kevin, a young physically disabled boy nicknamed Freak because of his short stature, learned at a very early age he wasn't going to live very long. Every day he faces new challenges but yet he still manages to find wonderful moments of beauty, humor and adventure in the most mundane of activities. Unlike Kevin, Max is a young learning disabled boy nicknamed Kicker because before meeting Kevin, he always used his hands to communicate any feeling. Despite their differences, their friendship grew and together, they became ""Freak the Mighty"" spending every waking moment together going on ""quests"" in King Arthur's kingdom (Freak's imaginary world), temporarily sharing Max's ""legs"" and Kevin's ""brain""."
4,It is sad.,"I was very surprised at the ending, but I thought the book had a good theme, and was creative. I liked that it had a dictionary at the end of the book, and how when it was over, something else happened. It was a quick book, but I didn't put it down till it was over."
2,Freak the Mighty,"I didn't really enjoy reading this book. I felt this book was rather boring. It didn't keep my interest. If I didn't have this book for a class I would never have read it. Nothing exciting ever happened, it was like a story with no end. It also didn't really flow smoothly so it was hard to determine what was going on."
5,Freak The Mighty Review,I enjoyed reading Freak The Mighty now I will write a review about the book. Freak the Mighty was a book about friendship. Max Kane never had a brain or a friend until Freak showed up. The book message is this. People who have learning disabillities can over come them if some one cares about them and can help guide them. Freak cared enough to help guide Max into learning and school. Max cared about Kevin and helping him particeapate in life and letting him do things that he only dreamed about when Max wasn't in his life. Max Freak Friends always and forever.
2,freak the mighty,I liked the book. At first I didn't like it then I as I listened I started to like it. It was sort of boring till they became good friends and all of the adventures they went on at the end of the book it was sort of sad.
4,Freak and Max Together,I really like the character Kevin because he never gave up and he was always up for new obsticles. I would recommend people who like misteries and who like sad books to read this book. This book taught me to look at people the same. the authors style is like it really happened to him. I liked this book because it was funny and sad. One thing that disturbed me was that they left you hanging at the end of each chapter.
5,"(...), Freak The Mighty Review","Freak The Mighty Is a good book. It Shows how two different people can get along and find out that they can join together and become an unstoppable person. The sensational book tells of Maxwell an oversized young man who gets teased about his physical and mental features. And Kevin (a.k.a. ""Freak"") who has a birth defect, who also gets teased about his physical features. So when freak and Max combine, the unstoppable Freak the Mighty is made. Freak the Mighty loves to slay dragons and rescue fair maidens, so theres no telling what trouble they will run into."
5,It works,"Not much to say, it worked out of the box and was cheap. I no longer have the phone I purchased this for, and have misplaced the cable. I can not speak for the longevity of the cable."
3,From the back cover...,"Haven't read this one yet, but here's the back cover.When it came to snubbing poor relations, wealthy old Aunt Harriet could have written the book--and did. When she finally died, all she left them was her lifelong diary, in 14 formidable volumes. Grandniece Susan sentenced herself to read every paragraph. Somewhere in this infernal journal she hoped to find a key that would provide entry to Harriet's will.She learned of 2 ruined romances--one accidentally deleted, the other deliberatley erased. She followed the diarist's painful passage from blithe young girl to bitter old woman. What was in the lines saddened Susan. What was between them terrifed her. She had a powerful inkling that Harriet's history had been penned, not in ink, but in blood--and that this diary would have dire results!"
1,DEFECTIVE TV,THE TV IS A DEFECTIVE ONE AND IS BEING SOLD TO CUSTOMERS WHICH I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE UNFURTUNATE ONES I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TV WORKING FOR ATLEAST GOOD 30 MINS WITHOUT ANY INTERUPTIONS ON IT.SO FELLOW CUSTOMERS BECAREFULL BEFORE BUYING THE TV.
4,seems to be helping,"We rescued a black lab recently and she seems to have a high amount of dander, much worse than our yellow lab had or our mixed breed. Since I do not want to have to give her a bath every week I decided to try this serum. I have used it a couple times and it seems to have reduced the dander quite a lot. She now only has a few flakes instead of being covered all over her back. I switched to using a soft brush to brush the serum into her hair instead of the recommended cloth because I wanted to really get it down close to the skin.Her coat is very soft and shiny after a few treatments of the product and she is not itchy so it is not drying out her skin as some products do.I am very excited that this is working to reduce the dander that I am allergic to.I also ordered an allergen spray for the house that neutralizes the dander in carpet and rugs. That product seems to be helping my allergies as well."
5,AWESOME,"THIS CD IS AWESOME I FIRST BOUGHT IT IN 1985 AND FORGOT JUST HOW GOOD IT REALLY WAS....THE MISERY SHOWS,,,,RUN TO THE LIGHT...EVERY SONG ON HERE IS A MUST HAVE,,,,TROUBLE KICKED BACK IN 85 AND STILL DOES IS 2005....."
3,"Great band, mediocre CD","Trouble may still be my favorite metal band of all time. They have a unique weeping guitar sound and heavy riffs that would make Tony Iommi proud. I always said that this band is what Sabbath should have become.However, this CD was a huge disappointment to me when it came out. Trouble's first two albums, Psalm 9 and The Skull, were incredible. Two of the best metal albums ever released. So Run To The Light had a lot to live up to. And it just didn't do it. The songs aren't as heavy. The changes aren't as interesting. The songwriting isn't as good. It's not that it's bad. It's just that it's a poor effort by a great band. For anyone who remembers the disappointment when Celtic Frost put out Cold Lake, this is Trouble's Cold Lake.If you want great Trouble buy Psalm 9, The Skull, and their self-titled 1990 album."
5,Exciting and riveting reading - couldn't put this one down!,"Jamie Tarabay tells it as it is without the blandness commonly associated with autobiographies. You relive her experiences with her vivid descriptions of events and her desire to provide an objective an assessment as possible of the troubles around her. She takes you through the highs and lows of life as a reporter in a region many of us never understand. I learnt so much more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after reading this book. She explains it in a way that's uncomplicated and makes sense. And her adventures sound like fun, even if ducking bullets by hiding behind a car or hitching a ride with militia is a bit crazy. It's a very good read and I strongly recommend it."
2,Almost turned it off,"Normally I like KS. I just could not get in to this movie however. Very short run time & I was actually wanting to turn it off but kept waiting for it 'to deliver'..but it never did.No need to post any spoliers...I just found it to be bla.......But, im sure others will enjoy it & you wont know unless you watch it..Sorta wisking I hadnt as again, it was just bla to me, but I would have always wondered whether I'd like it or not had I not watched it....Sometimes you watch something expecting it to be bad & you find a gem. Other times you watch expecting something great only to get bla.....I expected more from this but got bla instead....Others may love it, tho.Such is how the movie biz goes..."
4,Suprised that I enjoyed it,"My husband was just going in to Air Traffic Control when I bought this for him and he was already a pilot, so the movie held a lot of interest for him and the portrayal of things was realistic, according to him, except for the situation itself probably wouldn't happen. I don't know anything about planes, but I found the storyline captivating. If you are in ATC or you've watched it and loved it, it may be a fun movie to own, but if you are just wanting to watch it for the first time and have no special interest, I would just rent it."
3,Watchable and Thourough though a bit unoriginal...,"""Ground Control"" is another one of those air traffic controller movies. Sure, there hasn't been a whole genre of this film, but there are more films on this subject than you would think. Most people in this non-theatrical feature act very convincingly, and Henry Winkler's electrician Quinn is an entertaining comic relief. The mostly good acting and the above-average authenticity of controller actions, attitudes, and jargon save this movie.Otherwise, the plot is not too original, though it is executed somewhat stylishly and likeably. There are also way too many down points in the film where nothing exciting happens. It is definitely more of a drama of one air traffic controller, Jack Harris (Sutherland) coming to grips with re-entering the controller station after a plane crash on his watch five years ago, and should not be touted as an ""action/adventure"" picture."
5,Very Helpful,"I found this movie very interesting. Perhaps I should to tell you that I am working as a flight attendant and often wondered about the work of flight controllers. Especially when you get notice that you have to go into holding for a time or if you experience a serious case of bad weather... Well, this movie is not packed with violence and big adventure that's for sure but neverless it's real good. If you like the atmosphere of the airport and flying as such then this movie is for you. It's the story about one flight controller who was involved in an accident and tries to get back to this kind of work after five years in a particularly busy time. I hope you enjoy this movie and that you'll learn to appreciate the flight controllers as much as I did."
5,Progressive metal doesn't get much better than this.,"Great riffs, lots of time changes, soaring vocals. This is what Awaken the Guardian is all about. The musicianship of Fates Warning on this album is simply incredible. It really is a shame that John Arch retired after this album. Buy this CD just to hear a talented singer at his best. Highly recommended!"
2,2 star edition of above 5 star record.,"For those who haven't heard this record, this is one of the best metal records of all time and also one of the first progressive metal albums(released in 86, years before Dream Theater's 1st). If you like the genre, get it.The CD has been re-mastered and it sounds way better than the original release. The bonus cd has 3 demos and 6 live tracks. You can probably guess the quality of demos but the live tracks are beyond bad. It sounds like your downstair neighbor playing it and you're listening with your ears on the floor. Turning up the volume only makes it worse.The dvd is no better, home video footage with mostly still cam shots. At one point the image gets invisible and worst of all it happens during ""Prelude to ruin"", the best song on this album(IMO)So unless you are a die-hard fan of FW and collecting every single stuff of the band, get a regular re-mastered version(I believe there is)."
5,A must-have for Fates Warning Fans!,"The CD is a must have for any Fates fan. The sound quality is much better than the original. The DVD is interesting but because of the sound quality it is somewhat difficult to listen to. The rehearsal and live recordings are informative as to see how the band worked these songs and the stage. All in all, a must have for a Fates Warning fan."
5,A Classic,"I haven't listened to this in 20 years. I wish I could put it as eloquently as other reviewers, but my sentiment is the same.... this is a classic album. If you listen to it once and don't get it, listen to it about 8 more times. it will sink in. John Arch's vocals are the carrying instrument. The music is gorgeous. There are several chill-inducing moments on this album, and I'm so happy to rediscover it after all these years! Thank you John Arch. Please make more music now....please...."
4,"If you like excellent metal, You need to own this EP!","There are two fillers on the whole album wich are not realy fillers they just don't have the intensity and whole heart felt metal feeling you get from the other songs. Fates warning in the 80's is some of the best metal you will ever hear, F*** ATREYU and as i lay dying.... THIS IS VERY HIGH QUALITY OF THE PUREST FORMS OF MUSIC>...This is when metal singing took talent. Do not buy any of the new fates albums they are horrid crap, the singer blows and they don't even play metal anymore. Bottom Line is FATES WARNING AWAKEN THE GUARDIAN contains some of the greatest metal music ever recorded. If you dont like this than you simply suck!NEVERMORE SUCKS TOO>...BUY fates Warning's metal albums instead(not the garbage they make today)"
