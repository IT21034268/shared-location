2,last of mohicans,The director's cut wasn't as clear as the original for some reason the screen in many parts was just to dark to even see the faces.
4,The Last of the Mohicans,Very sorry all those excellent moments that were in the original movie are excluded. Why can't we get a DVD with the original movie on it? Please?!?
5,First class photography of blue ridge mtns and forests,This was an engaging movie. It should have never received an R rating. It had no cursing or nudity. There are violent scenes of scalping and fierce fighting which probably gave the R rating to the film The love story was in excellent taste and dealt with the hardships of life realistically. Filmed on location in the beautiful mountains of western North Carolina the scenery is spectacular. The historical content and costumes were excellent. Daniel Day Lewis gives an outstanding performance. Several of the actors in the film are actually American Indians. It displays the character of the people facing adversity and how they courageously dealt with it. Its a shame that Hollywood doesnt turn out more decent films. Most of what Hollywood turns out is fit only for the sewer.
1,Avoid this edition at All Costs!!!!!,"I agree with the reviewers above. The so-called ""Directors Expanded Edition"" is an absolute disgrace. Mann has managed to destroy a perfectly good film. If you can find the theatrical release on DVD or VHS, I suggest that you purchase it while you still can! Good Luck (you'll need it)!"
2,terrible transfer,"As stated in other reviews, the dark scenes are very black and one can barely make out what is going on. Forget it !"
4,Dan's Review of The Last of the Mohicans,The Last of the Mohicans was a great movie and the acting was superb. We watched it in 8th grade history class over several days.The war scenes were very exciting.This movie helped me understand the history of the Native Americans better.
4,classic film,"I love movies with beautiful scenery and this is one of my favourite. Add a great story, great soundtrack and good actors and you have my kind of movie. As with all good movies I loose myself for that moment and escape to another world that is different from what I'm used to. That is all I ask from a movie and this one does just that. I wanted to give this movie a four and a half star rating but didn't know how on the review page."
5,Last of the Mohicans,One of the best movies I've seen. I love the historical content. The music is excellent as well as the story line. Daniel Day-Lewis is at his best....!!
2,it just sits there like a bumppo on the log,"a major disappointment for me, because i like daniel day-lewis and thought he was a fascinating pick to play hawkeye. then i realized it was directed by hack michael mann. one of the inherent flaws in the leatherstocking tales (aside from purple prose) is that they are remarkably non-suspenseful for adventure tales; this might be why cooper has never really lent himself to dramatization. but in the hands of a sharp director, it CAN be made to work ( the disparaged randolph scott movie is fun)."
1,not that into it,I just finished watching this movie. I started it last night. Even though a movie was not good to me I still watch it all the way threw. Hopping the end would be so good I enjoyed the whole movie. That has happened before. Well.... this movie was not one of those movies. I have it because my husband likes this movie. But I do not like it. But that's just me. You should give it a chance to see what you think.... :)
2,Not a PG-13 film,"Although this product is listed as a PG-13 version of the film, this is incorrect. The film is rated R."
5,One of the Greatest Movies Ever Created,This movie has always been a top one for me. I have to say that the best part of it all is the score. Nothing has ever come close to it. The acting is amazing. Day Lewis gives a very concincing performance. As does the actor who played Magua. The only Minor flaw is the script could have used some sharpening as sometimes. However the screenplay is excellent (they are different things). The action is the most fun to watch. The score creates such a depressing atmosphere that you just want to stop the movie and take in life! All in all. This is an almost perfect movie. I would give it a very deserving 10/10!
5,The best of its kind,"Sticking to history and adding a personal touch are not an easy mixture in cinema. However, this film is successful in placing the viewer among the English, the French and the Native Americans torn between the two. It also develops characters that are easily followed and endeared or despised. I have watched the film many times and never advance to any favored scenes. The entire movie holds my interest and keeps me caring for, hoping for and suffering with the characters. A serious, interesting and personal expression of American history, The Last of the Mohicans is a cinematic gem."
3,last of the Mohicans,Great movie--however-it does not say that it is the wide screen version. Now Amazon tells me all of their movies in DVD are wide screen formatMy TV is an older model--so I get the black bar on the top and bottom of the screen.Not enjoyable to watch. Why are their movies all wide screen?Can anyone answer that one !!! patricia barnick
5,Last of the Mohicans DVD,It came very quickly and in great condition. I am 100% satisified. Thank you.
4,Review of original version,"Note - I recently saw the original version of ""Mohicans"" released on VHS in the 90s. This is not a review of the expanded or widescreen editions, nor the DVD version.The film itself was very good. Cinematography was excellent, acting was fine. The plot/storyline varied somewhat from the original tale as written by James Fenimore Cooper; however, the film was done well enough so that I didn't mind too much. The essence of the novel was still very much intact. Director Mann did a great job with this one.Four stars!"
2,So disappointing.,"When Amazon emailed me about Last of the Mohicans coming out on Blu-Ray I was ecstatic. I love the movie, and I am also gradually building up my Blu-Ray library since purchasing a Blu-Ray player last spring. However, the night it got mailed to my house I decided to watch it with my roommates and was SORELY disappointed. There were no scratches on the disc, yet the image would become pixelated and entirely unwatchable at random parts of the film. I thought it was my Blu-Ray player, but I checked 8 different Blu-Rays and another 8 regular DVDs and I never encountered the problem with them. Once I popped LotM back in, however, the pixelation returned. By all means get the movie, but maybe not this Blu-Ray, unless my copy was an isolated incident, in which case Amazon, please send me a working copy!"
3,"Great flic, but inaccurate!","After reading James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans, I was thrilled to see the cinematic portrayal of Hawkeye, one of the most interesting characters of any character I have read about. This movie destroys that image, and the movie has nothing to do with the book. If I had never read the book, this would be one of the better movies I have seen, but knowing that they butchered a phenomenol story and damaged the integrity of the characters is a dissapointment to me. This is a great movie, a great love story, but really I had to seperate the movie from the book. If you want to just see a good movie, then buy this DVD, but if you want an accurate portrayal of the visions of a great American novelist, Cooper, then by no means buy this movie."
1,bad image,"The movie is great, but the image is so awful. I am shocked with the quality. It is not Blu-ray, It's VHS."
2,Crippling blow to the best of movies!,"The director's cut DVD version of The Last of the Mohicans took what was one of the greatest films, a film that seamlessly combined romance, action, and some of the most beautiful cinamatography ever seen, and managed to destroy the flow of the film, change some of the stirring music and drop a few of the movie's best lines and moments all in the name of adding in extra scenes that are, in the end, completely useless. The DVD doesn't even contain the option to view the original version and has very little in the way of ""extras"" such as behind the scenes footage or interviews with any of the people involved. I am going to have to stick to my VHS version of this fantastic film, and recommend that others skip on splurging for this very disappointing DVD."
1,"Love the Theatrical Version, but I Hate the Director's Expanded Version","***This 1 star review is for the ""Director's Expanded Edition"" DVD version of this film and not for the ""Director's Definitive Cut"" Blu-Ray. Amazon is lumping the reviews. ***Like many others, I love the theatrical release of this film. It remains one of my favorite movies of all time. However, I made the mistake of purchasing the ""directors expanded version"" on DVD and I will not make that mistake again. Key dialog has been removed along with the moving song by Clannad, ""I Will Find You."" This all so we can get a few extra shots from the cutting room floor thrown in that look completely rough and unnecessary.I love this movie, but if there is a Blu-Ray release, I will not purchase the ""director's expanded edition."" There was no reason to issue the director's expanded version in the first place.If you agree, leave a comment."
2,I can't believe they left out the BEST line!!,"Great movie, but one of the BEST lines from the theatre and VHS version of Last of the Mohicans is: ""Do not try to understand them and do not make them understand you for they are a breed apart and do not make sense."" We got the director's cut DVD and although it has the great ""big message"" ending, it is missing the above line (and from what I understand, also others).In summary, video quality was good for us but the scenes are jumpy and the audio pretty bad.DVD version not worth the purchase. Stick with the VHS version"
3,"Great movie, bad DVD transfer","Imagine my disappointment when I viewed the DVD version of this epic tale of early America. The audio transfer is TERRIBLE! Much of the dialogue is barley audible and the music has lost much of it's depth. What happened to the Clannad vocal for ""Wherever you may go I will find you..."" ? The only vocal and they cut it! The added scenes are non-plus as far as I am concerned. I enjoyed the VHS version and wish I had bought it over this director's cut edition. Hopefully someone will do another competent DVD transfer faithful to the original version."
2,Blu-Ray very poor!,"What a disapointment! This movie is one of my favorites. The blu-ray video is no better than the DVD, maybe worse. The detail in the shadows is missing. The dialog is very poor,(parts of sentences are actually missing). I hope amazon will take it back."
2,Excellent movie ruined on DVD,"I love this movie (five stars) having seen it in the theater and on VHS. The DVD version was one of the first I purchased for my new home theater. Unfortunately, the video quality is awful, very grainey like you see on DirecTV. It really distracts while watching the movie. I now have many other titles and do not see such a poor quality picture. If you watch on a small glass TV it shouldnt be a problem. There are also no extras that are often found on DVD like behind the scenes info, director comments. etc."
5,Daniel Day Lewis is amazing,"Beautifully acted, beautifully filmed. Wonderful movie. An exciting story of love and revenge, honor and betrayal. I highly recommend this movie"
5,The Last of the Mohicans,Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeine Stowe bring this movie to life. It is one of the best love story of all time. The score for this movie just makes it more exciting. I love this movie! It so touching.
5,Awesome movie! Awesome story! Awesome cast!,What a magnificently photographed and edited movie.The epic story comes alive from the pages in this true to form film.
5,great,"I like the story, the actor, the music, the scenery, and that sense of family, care for each other for a higher purpose"
3,Good,"Good movie, very slow start hard to sit and watch. Fight scenes are good, Daniel Day Lewis was good in this but not Great."
5,Stunning,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it so many times that I could probably quote the entire thing. If you're looking for an epic romantic adventure set in the colonial period and you were disappointed and disillusioned with that God-awful film, The Patriot, then check out The Last of the Mohicans. It has all the subtlety and artistry that The Patriot lacked. There are some absolutely stunning images from this film: the shot of the bridge reflected perfectly in the pond, the scene under the waterfall, etc. The acting is uniformly fabulous. The action scenes are terrific. Can you tell I love this movie?"
4,"a very good ORIGINAL movie, but not exactly Cooper's novel","This epic, sprawling film is beautifully crafted and well-acted, but if you are looking for the film to serve as Cliffs Notes for James Fenimore Cooper's novel, I suggest that you look elsewhere. Several drastic changes have been made to the plot and main characters. The core of the story remains in a diluted form, but it has definitely been Hollywoodized into a decidedly more romantic, predictable variation on Cooper's novel. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for artistic license, I just don't want anyone waltzing into their literature class with a fastidious comment about the symbolism in Hawkeye and Cora's love affair, when it does not even exist in the novel. See the film for entertainment, just don't mistake it for the book."
3,Get the VHS,"I watched this movie in the theater when it first cameout. I bought the VHS when it came out.I loved the movie, the music, and the action. The sceneryis breathtaking and the movie flowed very well with superbperformances by almost everyone.When the DVD came out I wanted to get the better pictureand audio effect. The Cinematography is breathtaking.The clearness of the scenes is great.I was disappointed by the cuttings in the Director's""Expanded Edition"". To much was cut and not enoughwas added. The VHS cinematography is close to the DVD.You have more continuity in the movie, and don't have tolisten to Russell Means (usually brillant) ramble at theend and make the final moments of great emotion into aa rambling.Save your money and stick with the VHS."
2,Release the Original Version! PLEEEEAAASSE!!,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I just can't bring myself to by it in this ""expanded"" director's cut version. My apologies to the director, but we liked your first version better. I have it on VHS, but really want to add the DVD to my collection. But not this DVD. Please put the original version on DVD!!"
2,VHS version is better!,"The Last of the Mohicans has always been a favorite of mine. When it was time to update from video to DVD, I purchased it, threw it in the DVD player and was shocked to find one of my favorite films altered. Don't let the catch-phrase on the DVD cover fool you! It's not expanded. Yes, some scenes are edited differently and there's some extra dialouge just before the end credits, but Mann has removed some really great dialouge that, for me, makes this movie one of my favorites. This film hasn't been expanded, it's been altered. Why did Mann do this? The film was fine the way it was. If Mann was going to add footage to it, he should not had sacrificed original footage. A huge disapointment. I'll keep my VHS version and sell the DVD on e-bay."
1,Disappointing!! Completely different from the original movie,"Any current release of Last of the Mohicans on dvd is completely different from the original movie. This director's cut version has lost everything that made the movie great. I'm hoping the studio will release the real version on dvd sometime soon. Until then, everyone will have to settle for watching the original version on vhs."
3,"Poor quality encoding, comes with a directors cut warning.","I'm a big fan of this movie. Unfortunately the video encoding of the movie is not very good.In fact the DVD comes with a small piece of paper printed with ""This movie has been re-edited by Michael Mann. It is his definitive vision of the film. In order to create it, certain shots had to be lengthened, resulting in a momentary jump in the image."" Sounds like a last minute effort to excuse the poor encoding. Smoke in some scenes also causes problems in the encoding process.The movie is also not ""widescreen enhanced"" so I can see the scan lines on my 36"" Sony Wega. It's unfortunate that it has not been enhanced for widescreen.Still a ""must have"" for fans of this movie, especially since there are some scenes never before seen."
2,Poor Quality Blu-Ray,"This is a great movie, unfortunately the blu-ray transfer is horrible, especially in dark scenes, very disappointed in the qualify."
2,How to ruin magic: a director's gift,"I should have read these reviews more carefully instead of just assuming other were being overly analytical of the differences between the DVD and the VHS. I'll be brief...- Continuity: the story does not flow. It actually seems like a cheesy B movie with a ton of well dressed extras. I can't exclaim enough how fragmented this film feels in this release. It does not absorb you into the drama or action at all- Audio: The power of the amazing musical score in the original cut is entirely gone. The sound affects overpower the conversation at times and the music seems ill timed, not how I remember it at all."
5,spectacular,"a beautiful, breathtaking, romantic film. one of the best stories on screen. great actors,passionate & deep music throughout the movie. AWESOMENESS!! :0)"
5,Last of the Mohicans,"It's like this;To be a ""G""(gangsta) you must own several movies. Scar face, Casino, Good Fellas AND Last of the Mohicans. This movies is so good I could have slapped my my mamma, but she's the one that took me to see it. A bad ass movie."
2,Much neglected period of history needs better treatment,"Sure, the movie is fine for what it is. But what is it? An updated screen treatment of an inadequate 1936 screen treatment of a sterile and verbose early American novel. Cooper was not a great writer. But he was the first to voice a theme that Mark Twain finally successfully realized in Huck Finn. That American culture--flaws and virtues--springs from its contact with the frontier.It's a shame that the writers didn't return to the original source material to find the urealized potentialities of Cooper's work. Maybe someone will succeed one day in doing what film adaptations of earlier unsuccessful films and books should do: remain respectful of the author's intentions, but find the core of meaning that the earlier artists missed. No one has succeeded so far.I give this film two stars for the actors' performances, the film's technical merits, and the wonderful scenery of the Smoky Mountains."
4,the last of the mohicans,"ithought the last of the mohicans was great movie. It is and exellent movie of action ,romance, sacrifice, and revenge. The movie had mostly great acting and a great plot. All of the the battle scenes had alot of action. Over all I'd give it four stars because it could have been a little more realistic as far as the kind of things characters did to procect others. Such as when the woman jumped off the cliff so that no more of the Mohicans would be killed.landon m. oakes"
2,Very confusing,I wasn't too crazy about this movie. The ending was good but I must admit that i didn't understand a thing that was going on.
4,Good movie if you haven't read the book...,"I read the novel after having seen the movie and was dismayed by the number of liberties Michael Mann took to make the story. I loved the movie and the book. My advice to those who have read the book is to suspend whatever you know beforehand, because things happen in the movie which are COMPLETELY different in the book.That said, I would recommend this movie for the scenery, direction and cinematography. The story overall is good, but different."
3,Home Cut,"This movie becomes twice as powerful with a little bit of home editing. Keep opening scene (marred by stiff deer and stagehand)but then skip to arrival of Duncan in the carriage. As such, this becomes a story from the point of view of the young ladies, taken out of merry old England and thrust into the bewildering savagery of the colonies."
2,great movie- okay DVD!,"This is one of my favourite movies! I bought the DVD, even though I already owned a VHS copy because I thought it would be even better in the DVD format, but I was disappointed. The director's cut adds footage, but it also deletes dialogue/scenes and part of the musical score. I don't know what the people in charge were thinking! If the scenes were good enough to be in the theatrical release they should not be deleted for the DVD version! People normally buy a movie on DVD because they liked it in the theatre or on VHS! It is folly to cut parts out of a movie that people love in the original!"
4,good but could have been better,"My biggest complaint with this movie is that story was changed and not for the better. In the original novel, Cora(played by Madeline Stowe) was in love with Uncas(who is the last of the Mohican tribe) and Hawkeye was just some old guide, along for the ride. Also Cora's sister Alice is in love with Duncan, the English officer. In this movie there is a major turnaround. There is a love triangle-Duncan is in love with Cora who is in love with Hawkeye, who is young and attractive, and Alice has feelings for Uncas(and there is no character development for either one of them). I think perhaps the producers had a problem with an interracial angle although in this day and age you'd think Hollywood has gotten over it. I guess not. None the less, I liked the film-the story was still compelling enough, battle scenes were impressive and I loved the soundtrack(I own it, as a matter of fact)."
5,GREAT,"AUTHENTIC! Sets and dialogue we see a bit of history that seems to be void of Hollywood propaganda and political correctness, JUST THE HISTORICAL FACTS IN THE BACKDROP OF THE STORY! Wich seems to be so difficult for Hollywood to deal with and makes this movie so compelling not to mention the powerful music score Thanks Mr. Mann"
3,Not that bad.,"This movie wasn't too awful. Danial Day-Lewis is good, as always. There seemed to be some sloppiness toward the end of the movie, however, in the editing department. When Danial Day-Lewis runs through this ""cave"" type thing on the mountain you'll notice that the rock he runs past appears to wobble when he bumps into it as if it were actually something hollow covered with grey cloth. That's it I suppose. I would give a lengthier review but, I saw this awhile ago so I can't remember all the specifics."
2,I should have read the Amazon reviews before I got this,"I don't mind expansion nearly as much as I mind all the deletions from this version. I love this film, but the DVD expanded edition is awful. What is with these directors? It's like George Lucas saying Star Wars films are his and he can do what he likes with them. I'm sorry, but these films become part of our lives. Mess with them if you must, but at least give us the choice. I've been replacing my vhs with DVD, but back to the vhs version for me."
2,"Good movie, bad DVD","As others have noted, the original movie is awesome. The VHS version is awesome. But don't spend your money on this pathetic DVD. Some of the problems:The complete removal of the Clannad song presents an interesting, though inferior, variation of the movie. Technically, the DVD has visible glitches, which should have been corrected before the DVD was released. Some of the darker scenes have been lightened, which only serves to destroy the mood and remind you that you're watching a movie. You'll also learn why the last scene was edited severely in the original movie as you slowly begin to fall asleep from the boring political statement that is made....The DVD should have included the original version so that we could all ignore the absolutely lousy director's cut. (...)"
1,The Directors Cut Sucks,"I like this movie, but not the directors cut. That fool should have left it alone. In this version they've deleted scenes, removed dialog, altered the soundtrack, and added some very unneccesary and tedious extra footage that really just doesn't mesh well with the rest of the movie (IMHO). I was disgusted when I saw the changes. This is a great movie, it should not have been tampered with. The original version is available on VHS.LONG STORY SHORT: Great movie, but the directors cut bites."
2,Disappointment,"This is a terrible DVD. If you want the movie, buy the VHS version instead. Want to know why? Just read the other DVD reviews below. I don't think I need to repeat what everyone else has said already. What a major disappointment. I'm still waiting for a REAL director's expanded edition of this great movie."
3,Very dissapointed in the DVD,"This is my all time favorite movie, but I was so dissapointed in the DVD version. There were some scenes that were cut out that should have been left in. If you have never seen this movie, I reccomend the VHS version, it is by far better than the DVD."
2,"Read the ""dmw from Washington State"" Review","I absolutely agree with ""dmw from Washington State"". The DVD version is barely two stars; the theater and VHS version is more than 5 stars. dmw's description of the Theater, VHS and sadly the DVD versions are exactly on the mark. ""The VHS widescreen version in THX is a wonderful piece of entertainment. Unfortunately, this Director's Expanded Edition has destroyed the flow and continuity of the original."" The DVD version is a tragedy. Buy the VHS version and if you have a chance see this movie in the theater."
3,Avoid the Directors Cut DVD Edition,"If you've previously seen the original video release or theater release of this movie and enjoyed it greatly (as I did), then the chances are good that you will NOT like this ""directors cut"" edition. It's very hard to pin down what exactly is wrong with the changes--mostly it's a matter of breaking down the emotional intensity of the original film into a sort-of-boring revision.Also, even if you've not seen this movie before, you are probably going to be disappointed in the absolutely minimal ""special features"" on this disc. I also found that the sound quality was pretty bad--in several places I had some difficulty hearing the dialog.What I recommend is to rent the movie on VHS if you haven't already, and wait to see if they ever release the correct version on DVD (I'm not holding my breath). Personally, I regret buying this disc."
3,idiots who thought the book was better.,"Those who wrote the film Last of the Mohicans is inaccurate in it's adaption of James Feminore Cooper's novel should realize that Coopers novel to begin with is an inaccurate portrayal of earl American colonial life. In fact, not only is the novel outlandishly stupid,insulting to native americans but also completely unreadable. This is one of those rare instances when the film surpasses the novel in every conceivable way. As for the DVD version, yes I was extremely dissapointed but I am eagerly awaiting the original version to be released in January 2001."
1,A shameful TRAVESTY of the Literary Masterpiece,"Why did they call this movie ""The Last of Mohicans"", when it represents an outrageous travesty of the great novel? They should have named the movie ""Tarzan and the Savage Indians"". The important theme of interracial romance (written over 100 years ago!) was too taboo for Hollywood, so they white-washed it. The central heroic characters (who are Native Americans in the novel) were reduced to background static. I dare you to actually read the whole novel, before marking my review 'Unhelpful', and then decide for yourself how you feel about Hollywood's wanton, idiotic, greed-driven re-write of great classics."
4,Worthy,"I saw this movie years ago, but when you see it in Blu-Ray it adds dimension. Good story and it's entertaining."
4,The best film of the year in 1992! Stays true to the James Finnimore Cooper Novel of 1936!,Daniel Day Lewis is a fine actor andthis is the best movie he ever did!The most beatifully filmed movie ofthe year. The author of 'Scalp Dance'was wrong about this movie. Plus he'sa racist!
3,Disappointing,"I love the director, love the stars, but am totally lukewarm about the movie. It should have been terrific. (But then so should ""Titanic"".) But an unfocussed script leaves it not much more than some nice visuals and some nice sounds trying fruitlessly to hook up."
4,This film is GREAT,"As long as you like romance, history, and awesome scenery, you'll love this movie. The only problem is that it's not as visually awesome as it is on the big screen for which it was made. Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe make a beautiful pair. Everyone and everything in the movie has high visual and auditory impact. Some scenes, of war, are extremely disturbing but not gratuitous. It falls short of 5 stars only because I reserve perfect scoring for films in the caliber of The Sound of Music but Last of the Mohicans is also worth seeing several times over."
5,Definitely makes the short list...great movie.,"Incredible soundtrack, lush cinematography, awesome story. I especially like the ""fierceness"" of the love between Hawkeye and Cora; beautiful honor and integrity (reminds me of William Wallace and Murron in Braveheart...)."
2,Original VHS Movie Great - DVD Version Butchered,"When I purchased the ""Director's Expanded Edition"" I assumed this would, indeed, be an enhancement. But how dissappointing; the cuts are unexplainable and the additions laughable (such as at the end in which Chingachgook gives a long winded speech...so uncharacteristic of his character). Now I've seen the original on VHS several times, and that version is just wonderful! Knowing what was in the original and then watching this DVD version was such a let-down. I have a hard time believing the Director would actually butcher his own work. If you loved the original, you'll be disappointed with this version..."
3,THX Quality? What quality!,"Fantastic film, one of my girlfriend's favourites, highly recommended viewing. But I found the DVD picture transfer very poor - especially as many scenes are at night - and the sound was not much better dialogue really got lost, very disppointing. Surely a THX badge should stand for better quality than this or what's the point? I advise you check out a friend's copy first before purchasing."
1,"Critique of this DVD edition, not the movie","I was SHOCKED by the loss of some of the most memorable moments of this movie. With the exception of George Lucas chopping apart his original Star Wars trilogy, I typically trust director's editions. Imagine my surprise at the removal of character development with certain dialogue excised.What was Michael Mann thinking???This actually looked like a TV edit rather than an expanded vision from the director. This is an inferior portrayal of a personal favorite.How about a version that keeps ALL of it together? The theatrical elements AND the additional footage?I got this DVD on sale at retail with a free bottle of Coke. At least the Coke lived up to expectations."
5,Great movie,Have to give it to Daniel Day-Lewis. A great actor and the rest of the cast were excellent. DVD was in excellent shape.
1,Favorite movie,"Love the movie, but I hate the director's cut version of the LotM. After Hawkeye jumps out the waterfall and begins running up the mountains, they have changed the musical score. ugggh. Whinny I know, but that is my favorite section of the movie!"
1,Director's Cut a ATROCITY,"After hyping this movie up to friend, calling it - ""one of the best movies ever made"" - I was in horror as we viewed the DVD version of this film. (At this point - the ""Expanded Edition"" is the only version available on DVD.) The ""expanded"" enhancements only detered from the perfect balance of character definition, emotional struggles, and white- knuckle action of the original. As much as I loved the original (and BECAUSE of how highly I regarded the original), I would not recommend the DVD to anyone. I only hope that someday someone will fund the re-release of this DVD in its original format."
5,Love this movie,"I have loved this movie for ages and am so glad I can enjoy it in blue ray quality. I don't know that's its necessary to have it in blu ray to enjoy the movie, but it sure is nice!"
4,Good flick,"Grand views, beautiful scenery, good acting..... this is a good movie. The good guy thing is a little over played... running through the woods taking hip shots with a musket (the most inaccurate weapon in history) and hitting guys dead center is a little over played.... but for the most part, this is very well done."
3,"Great Movie, Sub-Par Viewing Experience","First of all, if you haven't seen this movie, go see it RIGHT NOW! The action sequences are excellent, not to mention the plot and music score.That said, I had high hopes for the DVD release, as it promised extended sequences, 5.1 audio, and better image quality. As for the first two, I was not dissapointed. The extra scenes contributed to the plot and enhanced the action. Also, the music is excellent. The image quality, however, leaves something to be desired, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. The MPEG translation (the process of converting 35 mm film into DVD format) was horrible with dark scenes and motion (the waterfall scene was especially bad) resulting in a blurred and/or pixelated image. All I can say is that I hope they release another version.Oh, and if you don't yet have it, grab the soundtrack. It's kind of in the theme of The Rock or Crimson Tide, by which I mean that it is really, really good."
2,"BluRay - Excellent director commentary, poorly presented color","It's always good to hear Michael Mann talk about anything and the commentary here is excellent.However, the color in this BluRay presentation is not good. Much worse than the DVD and theater release. Darker, inaccurate, and unpleasant to the eye. There are exceptions. The officer uniforms and the flags at the surrender negotiations are in full magnificent color, but the surrounding scene is muted and ugly. The scene, early on, where the carriage crosses the BiltmoreEstate bridge, is so muted and so lacking in contrast as to be nearly unwatchable. What a shame. I'll stick with the DVD of this magnificent movie and be totally content. Skip the Blu-Ray edition is my recommendation."
3,Beware of other editions,"Great film, if you get it in the right format. I ordered this DVD through one of the ""New and Used"" distributors on Amazon and what I received was not the edition listed here. When ordering, make sure you are buying the 2002 Enhanced Widescreen issue of this film. If the date on the case is 2001, keep looking. Earlier versions are disapointing, with poor sound quality, a grainy picture and a less-than-full widescreen. The one I received also has absolutely no extras, although the case claims it has a theatrical trailer. Make sure you get the right version to appreciate this film for what it is."
2,A very disappointing DVD - not recommended,"I would not recommend the DVD version of LOTM. It takes away the music, in some scenes where the music is critical, as well as some quips which were crucial to illuminating the characters. Also, the additional scenes, to my great surprise, did nothing to add to the film; indeed, they interrupted the general flow of the film and were rather annoying. Until I saw the DVD version of this film, I never thought editing was a much needed process."
2,"How was the ""R"" rated?","There's absolutely no action in this film! The fight sequences looked like something Walt Disney and friends could have slapped together! I sat through the whole thing, awake, which, by the way is not easy, because not only does this thing have no action, the story's not very interesting, either. The acting is overly melodramatic and the film itself is entirely to LONG.For a good movie set in the same era that's also a lot cheaper, pick up The Patriot."
3,Gorgeous but empty would-be epic,"The Bottom Line:This version of Cooper's The Last of the Mohicans looks great (it was directed by Michael Mann after all) but the central romance never really clicks and, despite being a great actor, Day-Lewis can't breathe much life into lead character Hawkeye at all; say what you will about middlebrow epics like Braveheart and Gladiator, but they at least succeed in getting the audience invested in the leads, something this movie is unable to do.2.5/4"
5,Great movie great score,This is one of the best films ever. Not only is it a great classic story but the acting is exceptional and the score for the movie is one of the best ever.
2,"No ""I Will Find You""","I am very upset with this version of Last of the Mohicans. I love the movie, but the song ""I Will Find You"" is not in this version. Why is that?"
5,Review Title,"The definitive work on the occult Tarot of the Western Hermetic Tradition.Includes astrological, numerological, colour, Hebrew letter, and musical, correspondences.Deals mainly with the Major Arcana, and although divination is covered, it is not the book's main emphasis.I've never read a book so full of erudition, wisdom, practical advice, and clear, concise explanation. My copy goes with me wherever I go.in L.V.X."
2,Tarot card illustrations are NOT given in color,"This is a good book for studying of the Tarot, however you will not see any of the Tarot card illustrations within the book given in color. The colors within the cards are VERY important for understanding underlying meanings of the Tarot, and that it is not provided diminishes this book considerably. Therefore I have to give this book a two star review, it would otherwise have 5 stars."
4,Planetary exuberance,"The other reviewers are all correct in their praise but the only fault I find is the inclusion of Neptune and Uranus as planetary influences on the cards. I'm definately old school in this regard but tradition works. I wonder what ""modern"" astrologers are doing with Pluto now that it is just goofy."
1,The Tarot: A Key to the Wisdom ofthe Ages,The book was printed in black and white. I wanted a version in color. The description did not explain that. I received the book in a very timely fashion. Many thanks.
5,Loads of laughs with a crowd,"We have played this game many times, and I've bought it as gifts for several people. Great fun with 6 or more players. Highly recommend it!"
5,Almost too much fun!,"This game is one of the most fun I have ever played. At first, when I explain it to people who haven't played before, they say things like, ""That sounds too easy"" but it's not as easy as it seems.It is tremendous fun. I recommend this game to everyone! I've played 3 times, and every time I have played, I laughed so hard that my stomach muscles were sore for the rest of the night!The only problem I had was a few repeat cards, and if you shuffle the deck ahead of time, you might not even notice the repeats.Note that it is not a short game, I don't know exactly how long, but at least an hour. It's great for parties, and game nights. We played it for my sister's bachelorette party, and all the girls loved it. That's not to say that it's a girl game, I have played with guys who loved it too.It's a great game, and you'll get a lot of great laughs out of it. When the night is over, you'll feel wonderful!"
5,Time's Up is SPECTACULAR,"I was invited to a Time's Up party a few months back and I was skeptical that the host could have a party that was anywhere near as great as she was claiming. Turns out, she underestimated! This is a fun game that can be used for so many different ages. I play with my friends and with my family (of two parents, myself a 20 year old and my 13 year old brother). Even though we have different ages and knowledge banks, we can all play the same game and have so much fun. I would be hard pressed to find a game that tops this one."
5,Upllifting for musicians and non-musicians alike,"If you love and understand the creation of music, this book will be a joy to read. I, however, do not. In spite of my lack of any kind of musical gift, I was really caught up in this inspiring book. To see how a mix of rock/classical/modern music can be used to spread the word that hope and joy can only be found in Christ, was fascinating."
2,i thought it would be great... boy was i wrong.,o.k. at first i was beyond excited when i heard that there was finally a baseball game coming out for the gba. i studied as much stuff as i could and i was pumped to go buy it. it finally came out and i did so. o man. i popped the game in and played an exhibition game. it looks great! and plays well too. but all i look for in a baseball video game is the option to trade players and keep stats. IT HAD NEITHER OF THOSE OPTIONS!! this was the only reason i wanted the game!! so for those of you looking to buy the game this is a thing you must remember. DONT BUY THE GAME IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ICHIRO ON YOUR TEAM ALONG WITH BONDS AND IT DOENST TRACK STATS SO BONDS CANT REACH 71!! i hated this game so much i took it back and am patiently waiting for another baseball game with these options to come out.
2,DAMN THIS GAME WAS BAD,"I REALLY WANTED A GAME FOR GBA AND WHEN I SAW THIS COMING OUT I THOUGHT OK LET'S TRY IT, BUT WHEN I GOT IT IT WAS HORRIBLE I COULDN'T TRACK STATS OR TRADE PLAYERS WHICH ARE 2 KEY ELEMENTS 2 THE GAME OF BASEBALL. JUST WAIT FOR ANOTHER BASEBALL GAME THIS IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. I KNOW IT WAS A WASTE OF MINE."
3,Level The Playing Field,"I play this game on a Logitech Wingman joystick.I have played the computer six times and lost five of them, some by lop-sided scores. The game seems to favor the computer players decidedly. The computer pitcher can throw fastballs, sweeping curves, etc., but my joystick pitcher does not seem to be able to throw much of a variety of pitches.I admit I'm not a computer expert and maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it just seems the game definitely favors the computer. I play in a Pro mode. I would like a little more equality between the human and computer players. Also twice the game has crashed in the ninth inning of close games. It is fun to play, but I wouldn't rate it over 3 stars."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"I am baseball fanatic and played virtually all the baseball games out there. By far, this is one of the worst games. Characters are so small that it looks like sticks moving around. No realism. There was some error in my game where the opposing pitcher walked my player, but my player stopped halfway towards the first base. Seems 3D0 worked on this for a while and just quit. Terrible job, get racing games for sports but not this one."
3,disappointing,"Although this game has good arcade value, as a baseball sim it leaves much to be desired. Basic baseball plays such as base stealing, fielding errors, and hit batters are conspicuously absent. Also, they got some basic baseball rules wrong -- for some reason when my batter drew a walk he was not awarded first base...Overall, it is a fun diversion with attractive graphics, but I would not buy it if you expect a realistic baseball simulation."
1,Disappointing,"What a terrible port. I'm serious when I say this is the worst handheld baseball game I've ever played. I enjoy world series 95 on my game gear better than this. There is absolutely no depth, running [or pickoffs], no stats [my biggest whine] and no trades. Also, the AI is ridiculously easy. You'll be begging for some high heat to your head by the end of a 9 inning game."
2,OK game but has a lot of glitches!,"Bought this game thinking it would be the best baseball game for any handheld system. The graphics are stupendous, but what it lacks is AI. Once in awhile I'll play games where I hit a flyball and get out, then one of my guys on base runs around the bases and goes home without me telling him to. The computer lets my guy do that and it doesn't even count as a run. The AI of this game is poorest I've ever seen on any baseball game! Worse yet, it doesn't keep track of statistics!! I usually go back and play my Ken Griffey Jr. game for the original Game Boy! Not worth getting!"
3,Nice!,"Over all I love (and I mean love ) this game. But the game is WAYto easy! With one 1 inning game I lost 1-0 but after that I won every singel game. Here are some facts that makes the game lose 2stars.1. You can`t steal. I always leave runners stranded on base because if you get a fly out a runner can`t steal home cause theyare at 1st base, not 3rd.2. Walks. If a runner gets 4 balls on him (known as a walk) he isn`t awarded 1st base.3.(The last one.) Can`t get hit. If a ball hits a batter in the helmet the ball goes right through him. I would reccomend it to little kids who don`t know much about baseball."
2,Great graphix and decent game play but......,"The graphics are great...especially for the tiny screen that the GBA has. My major complaint is gameplay. I love baseball. The stats I don't care so much about. But simple things like a hit and run, stealing, performing a double switch (in your national league games) don't work on this game. Playing against the computer is interesting too. I played a 13 inning game where the closer for the computer team came in the 8th inning and pitched for five innings. Not a very realistic thing. Trading players so you can make up your own team would be nice as well. Graphics 5 stars. gameplay 1 star. Looks are nice, but gameplay is more important in my book."
3,ITS OK,I read some other ratings & 1 of them told me the game doesnt have it to where u can keep ur players stats it doesnt even have trade players!!!!!!!!!!!! thats the 2 things i expect out of a baseball game. i bought the game anyway.i wasnt as disappointed as i thought i would be. cuz U JACK HOMERS LIKE CRAZY!!!!!!!!! thats the only reason i gave it 3 stars. i dont recamend it though.
5,dee dee bridgewater is phenomenal,"dee dee bridgewateris phenomenal. if you ever get a chance to see her live-do it. the best shows i've ever seen. band is too cool, too."
5,what's everyone here going on about?,"That's right! What's the story here? Dee Dee is probably one of the best (although not quite getting the acknowledgement as a certain ms krall) in her class and her renditions here are just awesome. That's that!Her scat abilities are just awesome and I found her interpretations fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed this album. There's only one Ella and it's not fair to compare Dee Dee to her. Than again, there's only one Dee Dee. Keep up the good work girl!"
2,Not what I expected,"I thought I was purchasing a Western. The story starts out in England? Don't remember off hand because it was a while ago that I started reading the story. I never got past the second chapter so not sure how it evolves into being offered amoung the topic of Westerns. In all fairness this might have been a great story, just not what I was looking for."
2,disappointing,I had expected this to be Ella with Duke's band. Mostly it wasElla and a trio. The title is misleading.
5,I Love It!,"My friend got me this for my birthday since I love hermies! Its sitting on my dresser. Great plush toy, I reccommend it!"
1,plush hermit crab,"I ordered this hermit crab for a young child . I was very disappointed it was not plush rather made out of some kind of hard plastic...I do not know if someone pulled the wrong item in a large warehouse or just that it was described very wrong. This is not for a young child, it would make a better hammer."
5,Great CD,Of course it's from Disney so it's most always likely gonna be great. This is a great selection of songs for anyone with the kid in us. I listen to it over and over.
4,Gets in yer head,If I had my perfect day i would start it out this way. Open up disneys premEARS and throw down. (...)This cd gets in yer head and it sticks there like grip tape. It's not quite as good as premEARS but it's close. Song 3 is the best. If you don't love brit then your just not human.
1,This toy is NOT for an aggressive chewer like a lab,Within MINUTES our lab puppy ripped the boot off of the leather strap and there were bits and pieces of the leather strap everywhere. I cannot recommend this product.
4,This is a good book. Definitely helpful.,"All in all it isn't anything new, but it may confirm a few things we have suspected. I did miss the 'help' and suggestion part. I mean, now I know....and now what?"
4,Enjoyable AND educational,"I thought this book was entertaining and I was able to take a few points away from it as well. I told my sister-in-law about it and she read it, too. She really like it, she said it helped her to realize a lot of things she had not been aware of before reading it."
2,Example Code Doesn't Work with VFP 5.0,"This book is written for Visual FoxPro 3.0, and when running the example projects in version 5.0 they must be converted. The conversion apparently causes some kind of problem that may cause the code not to execute properly. This makes following the tutorials in the book rather difficult.I e-mailed their ""support"" staff, and after waiting more than a week for a response, they said in essence they had received this complaint before, but didn't know what to do about it.I'd skip this book unless you're working only in version 3.0."
2,Very Interesting,"York writes an interesting book and a worthwhile read if you are into the whole battle of the 'left' vs. the 'right'. York believes that the left will continue to get stronger in the future as it plots to take down the right. If York believes that the right is winning in spite of some vast left-wing conspiracy however, he is simply flattering his target audience. Overall I would recommend this to someone who is a strong Republican supporter but all others will probably be disappointed."
1,You're kidding... right?,"The premise of this book is that there's a ""vast left-wing conspiracy"" because there happen to be liberal politicians, bloggers and actors living in the United States who all share similar views and make their opinions heard.Okay.... and?Just as there are conservative politicians, bloggers, entertainers, multi-millionares, heads of state, etc., working in unison to further THEIR causes - like bringing down their own presidents. (Clinton, anyone?)Name one one major media source that is criticizing this administration, or even mildly questioning the actions of our politicians. Just one.I mean, give me a break. ""Vast left-wing conspiracy"" my butt. They can't even win elections! What conspiracy!?! That they have a different point of view than you?Do the people who claim to have read and enjoyed this book even get the irony?Pro'ly not. What a bunch of numbskulls."
1,The Left Wing is just cathching up!,"This election disproved Byron Dork's point before he made it. If there was any coordinated message on the left other than Bush is an idiot and a very dangerous President, which is proven true day by day, I didn't see it. Michael Moore was beating on the Democrats as much as the Gop. Kossacks where feeding on each other! This Administration got a free ride from the MSM from 9/11 on. No second guessing of WMD's, Chalabi and Curveball, No Questioning of the Patriot Act, Iraqui troops levels. No further investigation by MSM of Man-whore Gannon, Outing of Plame, any of Shrub's appointments of lobbyists to regulatory positions, special provisions in the bankruptcy bill for asset trusts, amendments to the Medicare bill disallowing price negotiations for the american people. I could go on but I think you get the point. I don't think Byron York reads anything other than his own columns."
1,The Right becomes more moranic by the day,and this will be another right wing book gathering dust in the dollar stores discount bin.
1,Horrible,"It's basically just a bunch of vitriolic hate speech. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they want a good laugh (then again, go to a library instead of giving them your hard-earned money)."
5,That Hippie doesn't like anything...,...except for steam cleaners and tube socks ( see his previous reviews).
1,Byron York's Hubris,"This book is just the latest installment of fatuous screed from the republican noise machine. I'm sure it will play well to the likes of Limbaugh, Coulter and their followers. Regrettably, there seems to be precious little in the way of truly informative journalism these days -- just one-sided, confabulative rants like this to advance political ideology."
3,"Work well, but expensive","Can't seem to find these at any retailer in SoCal, so online only. Balls work fine, but the pitching machine is another story."
1,Waste of money,My 22 pound dog had the stuffing out of the head after an hour of play. Not for chewers as advertised.
1,Wrecked in about 2 hours,"I have an English Cocker Spaniel that just loves to chew. She especially loves stuffed toys, BUT she has become an expert at destruction. I thought this toy would last at least a day or two. She got the leg off in about 30min and is working away on pulling the velcro off. All in all if you have a super chewer, forget this toy. More money down the drain! Back to the NylaBone...which she really doesn't like, but will sometimes gnaw on if nothing else is available."
3,Nice toy but..,I bought a few of these toys and easch one of them my Teacup Chihuahua who weighs in at 4 pounds has taken the stuffing out of them all.One or two of them she had the stuffing out in less than a day the others in a week.She still enjoys the outter shell of these toys and for that I give it 3 stars.
3,no toy is strong enough for my dogs,I don't think these are any tougher than any other stuffed toy. not worth the extra price
2,This thing is tiny!,"The description says its 7"" from end to end, well not by my tape measure, if I really pull on it I can get it to 6"". This looks like a beaver not a squirrel and it more of a cat toy. My 11 week old puppy has played with it a bit, but likes his bigger, longer toys. The price of this should be $1.00 not $4.50. It reminds me of a brown tiny mouse, UGH!!"
5,They call it Chihuahua puppy love,"I have a male Chihuahua puppy who has decided this toy is his baby. He still plays with other toys, but this toy must be near him at ALL times. If the toy gets lost in the blankets (or stolen by one of sisters), we have a problem. I ended up buying 3 more of these, because he gets so frantic when his ""baby"" goes missing, and also because the original one was murdered by one of his Chihuahua sisters =/ She sneaked the toy outside during freezing temps, and the ""baby"" froze overnight. =/ These toys are the perfect size for Chihuahuas and small mouths. All of mine love them, but this specific version seems to be the favorite."
1,Too Tiny! - Sent a Beaver and Not a Squirrel - Don't Buy,It was so tiny and it does not look like the photo. It is about the size of a small mouse.Don't buy it if you are looking for something for even a medium size dog. It is more like a cat toy.
4,"Not Indestructable, But Then Who Among Us Is?","In her review of Frosty Dog, Chantal Ritz says that she doesn't think that any dog toy is ""truly 'indestructable.'"" I agree. There's not a dog toy made that can withstand the chewing of a particularly determined mutt. So the only really fair tests for a dog toy are whether your dog likes it; whether it's safe; and whether it holds up reasonably well when subjected to day-to-day gnawing? With those tests in mind, the ""Dynamic Duo,"" (a male Westie and female Scotty) give Frosty Dog four stars. They are currently trying to dismember their second. The first one lasted a year, the last six months of which were spent with two legs and no nose. And they would still be playing with it, except that I got tired of looking at the poor bedraggled thing. By the way, I think that the ""large"" FD is probably the right size for all, but the very smallest, dogs. The Dynamic Duo only weigh in at 20 pounds each, but the ""large"" FD suits them fine."
2,Lasted a couple of hours,My Australian Shepherd chewed out the squeaker pouch less than two hours after getting this toy. The belly of the dog now has a large hole. I was expecting something much more durable for the price and after reading the other reviews. I wouldn't recommend buying this if you have a large dog.
5,small teddy bear,"My ten week old Shih Tzu puppy loves this toy. Small and light enough for him to carry around, and holding up to those sharp puppy teeth just fine"
1,Might be ok for a cat.,"It lasted about five minutes. I'd say it was a complete waste of money. Oh well, such is life. Peace."
2,Item was a lot smaller than it was pictured.,"In the piicture the item looked a lot larger than the item that was delivered. The toy was only 2 1/2 inches long, hardly worth it."
4,Cute and durable!,I bought this for my brother's chihuahua and she loves it to death! It seems to last quite awhile for a smaller dog and she drags it everywhere!
3,Great....without the tail!,"This little chipmunk is very hard for my 7lb pup to do any damage too, except for the tail. The hair-like fabric that it's made out of is easily plucked out of the animal. I've noticed my dog walking around with the fibers stuck to his mouth. Overall though, these Kong Material products are great!"
3,"Well made, not my pup's favorite though.","After purchasing several Kong Material stuffed animals and seeing that my little 7lb puppy couldn't rip them apart, I expanded and purchased most of their other stuffed toys in size small. This one isn't my favorite. I think the material is just too plush. Kong also uses a fleece material for their other toys, and I feel that maybe they should have done the same for this one. Definitely sturdy though!"
3,overpriced,It was advertised as 3 for $12.00. This two inch dog cost me $10.00. If I knew they were going to split it up into three seperate charges I would never have bought it!!
3,Disappointed,My Maltese managed to put a hole in it within 5 minutes. Really surprised for a Kong product.
5,Kali's favorite toy,"My dog isn't really big into toys...or she wasn't until I got this for her. I have a little min pin who LOVES chasing small (and large) animals. She absolutely LOVES this toy! Keep in mind that this toy is a small toy which is intended for small dogs. The size is perfect for my small 10 lb dog. If your dog loves to go after squeakers, this toy comes with an extra one, and you can even opt to remove the squeaker before you even give it to your dog. There is a line of sturdy velcro on the belly of the toy that allows you to remove it. My dog rarely lets go of this toy and it has held up quite nicely, but she's not an aggressive chewer. I highly recommend this toy for dogs who love to chase animals. Kali loves it!"
1,Destroyed in half an hour...,"I bought the Kong stuffed lamb a week ago for my dog after reading positive reviews and claims that it was durable and worth buying. I gave it to my 17 lb corgi-jack Russell mix who had it destroyed within 30 minutes. She pulled the squeaker out of the ""secure"" pouch and it had to be taken away from her. There is no point to the extra squeaker since the toy is destroyed. The toy may have ""less stuffing"" than most but still enough to be pulled all over the room. She tore the limbs and ears off easily. I know my little dog is rough on toys, but this one was no better than the cheap toys at the grocery store. I do not recommend this toy if you have a dog that chews and pulls. I am sadly giving up on soft toys since I have not yet found one to survive a single full day."
1,Horrible Horrible Item,1. This item is the size of a field mouse2. My Beagle had it ripped apart in less then 5 minutes.
1,this toy lasted <5 minutes,I would not have been so upset if this had not been listed as a toy for aggressive chewers. We buy a lot of dog toys and this was the worse.
2,Waaaaaaaaaaaay too small!,"I bought this for my baby lab puppy and mercy, he only used it the first week we brought him home. It is super small and he quickly fished out the squeaky on the inside. I ended up giving this to a friend with a cairn terrier puppy - probably a much better fit! This is smaller than the palm of my hand!!!"
1,Not what I expected,"Maybe it was my own fault for ordering this-- but my 28lb beagle destroyed this toy in about 35 seconds. Itsy bitsy, about the size of the squeaker inside of it. Seemed more like a cat toy to me."
2,"Not for the ""Sq-weak"" of heart","My dog loves squeeky toys. When I saw that Kong made a squeeky product, I decided to give it a try. This is a small dachshund, mind you, not a huge dog, or even medium. Within three minutes (we timed her) she had broken the squeeky inside. I replaced it and again, and this time she was able to get into the plushie and destroy the squeeky. Now, she has a husk of a toy. If your dog is a hard chewer, this is not the toy for it. I just wish the description would have stated this."
3,to small for dog,I purchased the squirrel for our puppy that can destroy most toys. First off this is not a squirrel it looks more like a beaver. second it is really not intended for dogs over 10 pounds. It states it is for dogs 10 to 25 pounds and my 15 pound puppy had this completely in his mouth the moment I gave it to here. I did buy the large one and she loves it.
2,Too small,Would have been a perfect toy in the largest size. Would not recommend the small one for any dog except perhaps a toy-breed baby. It's just too small for safe play.
3,Well-made,"Cute for a smaller dog, but if you don't have a miniature dog, get a larger size. I like the fact that it doesn't have stuffing."
2,Small = minuscule,"I think the toy is fine, just a warning to read the dimensions. The small size is appropriate for a cat."
2,Too small,Way too small for any dog that is bigger than the average cat. I gave it away to someone else since it wasn't worth shipping back.
4,puppy toy,"This is a nice small toy to carry around so your puppy can chew on it instead of your fingers. Our boxer pup loves this toy . . . don't know how well it will hold up when he is older, but it is perfect now."
4,"Good Toy, But Small","My dog likes the toy, but it is small. The ""squeaker"" is kept inside by Velcro, and they come with an extra squeaker."
1,"Call it ""Silly Nemesis"" instead.","Too many villains, too little plot. The Cybermen should've been the only villains and they should've been more formidable. Further, the plot was reminiscent of ""Remembrance Of The Daleks."" A complete waste of time all around."
2,Rehash of the seventh doctors' dalek story!,Watch this episode if you are die hard fan of the series ! Other than that it's a rehash of the dalek story with MCcoy!
1,"Another 1,000,000 viewers lost forever ...","...each episode of Doctor Who in this era had more people switching over to watch static rather then see the immature characters, disturbingly awful designs and effects, and most importantly impotent scripts. 'Sliver Nemesis' is no different then any other Doctor Who story in the late eighties: it's lame. The decay of this series after its peak during the Hinchcliffe era was a slow and progressive decay through odd stories to silly ones, cool Jack Kirby-esqe designs becoming camp Broadway costuming, dark backgrounds all became intensely lit giving away all elements of suspense and horror, and worst off they tried to make the side-kicks 'coooool'(the ultimate end time sign of any show). Buy this video at your own risk."
1,Glass was Broken on Arrival,"The glass was broken on arrival. The packaging was not sufficient. Oh well, you win some, you lose some."
1,Not a good value,"Terrible quality. The backing wouldn't even stay on because of the different size between it and the frame. Very flimsy. Not worth even the good ""deal"" it seems to be."
1,Lack of professionalism,My order is incomplete and I have tried contacting the company ttat sold the item twice and theyu are not responding. I am extremelt disappointed. I ordred four of these frames; the invoce even says they are four but they only shiopped one to me. I am so frustrated and wished I had not dealt with this company.
2,mediocre frames,"i ordered 2 of these, and they were both pretty pathetic, as frames go. with one, the glue from the package stuck to the frame, and i wore off some of the finish by removing the glue. overall, not a good buy."
1,Disappointed,"The frame was very nice, just what I wanted, but it arrived with the glass in a thousand pieces. I could not use it and wasn't able to get out and get one locally because I am a shutin. So, I am very disappointed."
2,Eh- could be better,"They sure seem to over estimate the potential of us dummies. I have a fairly strong knowledge of Access, but without any formal Access training, there are some holes in my knowledge base. Not only was the language only quasi-easy to follow, but it did not answer the questions I have nor really fill in the holes. It does cover the basics, but I don't recommend it for those how-do-I-query-'this'? type of problems. Not for problem solving/trouble shooting."
1,A frustrating waste of time.,"The book starts out great, explains things in a way that makes sense and leads you to believe that you're fixing to learn something. But......it is so full of mistakes! There are so many code errors and figures that just don't jive. After the 7th code mistake by Chapter 9, I quit. I felt like the publisher should send me my money back, as well as a check for proofreading the book for them. Skip this book!"
4,"good, but has just enough SQL to get you into trouble","This book is good for getting started in Access 97 programming, but it only scrapes the surface of SQL. There is no mention of the different types of joins in SQL and implementing the action queries."
4,"Excellent access book, but definitely not for a dummy","This is among the best computer books i bought. It is a bridge between a beginner access user and a beginner access programmer. It answered a lot of my access VB questions and opened me a window of SQL. Easy to follow, welll organized and excellent CD samples. However, the book required a certain amount of knowledge of VB programming. I could not have enjoyed it without my previous experience in VB. Be carefully, real dummies!"
2,There were a lot of errors in this one!,"While this book did contain a good deal of useful information and was generally easy to follow, there were a large number of errors and inconsistencies. Many times I entered VBA or SQL code straight from the book only to receive error messages. The install program provided on the CD ROM would not install properly, although it was pretty easy to copy the databases and extra chapters manually to the hard drive. Also, the lack of a GLOSSARY! and a sub-average Index were major liabilities."
2,Not nearly as great as the Excel 97 Programming for Dummies,"The Excel 97 Programming for Windows for Dummies by John Walkenbach was a great book for learning VBA for Excel, and it included coverage of some advanced topics. Each chapter kept building your understanding in a logical way until finally advanced topics were explained. Based on my experience with the Excel 97 Programming book, I purchased the Access 97 Programming book by Krumm. However I was quite disappointed with the Access 97 Programming book. It's coverage was spotty with some select in-depth examples. As an example, the coverage of the RunCommand was two example statements: DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdWindowCascade and DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdOptions. The explanation for RunCommands was as short as the two commands. It seemed that virtually every time I was looking for help on a VBA issue, there was nothing relevant in the Access 97 Programming for Windows for Dummies book."
2,Forgot What A Dummy Is,"I have been reading the book, and tediously following the examples and tutorials. About half way through I am unsatisfied. The book shows a lot of code development but forgets to tell how it is useful (""why""). (The writer presumed the reader doesn't have some programming in mind?) There are very few good, complete, useable/stealable/adaptable examples. And the reader is not ""led"" through the manners in which the code can be engaged in a program. It spends an inordinate amount of time on code for limited usefulness programming features.Additionally, I have found (so far) three places where the code doesn't work; I presume someone updated Access and the book's examples were not tested or someone did a lazy revison."
4,Almost Perfect!,"This is a terrific collection of instrumental classics, with but one exception. It's missing the absolute best song of this genre, ""Green Onions"" by Booker T & the MG's. Booker T is represented here, but how can any such compilation omit ""Green Onions""? On the plus side, there are outstanding tracks by the likes of Junior Walker & the All Stars, Hugh Masekela, Kool and the Gang, The Meters, James Brown (and the JB's too), Dennis Coffey, Billy Preston, The Commodores, and more! Plenty of good stuff here. I recommend it for sure."
5,Extremely Good Value from Amazon.com,"Pocket rockets are quiet and provide very powerful stimulation and intense orgasms. I have tried others and have never found anything that works better for me. I used to buy them at a local retail outlet where I paid $29.95 for the exact same vibrator. I like the convenience and price of buying from Amazon.com. They are reliable and provide good life. When they start getting noisy and using up batteries too fast, I replace them and always keep a replacement on hand."
2,What happened??,This is my second Doc Johnson. I had another one about 10 years ago and have had some other pocket rocket types in the past. I was not impressed with the power this provided. Too weak for me.
2,Noisy and single setting,"Will it get the job done? Probably.The lack of multiple settings it a bit frustrating.Strong for it's size. The first time we tried it, I thought it would rattle my fillings loose. Too much for me.If you need something portable, it seems small enough although I'd say that if it falls out of your hand bag, ain't no body gonna mistake it for something else.I got mine free with purchase so I can't complain about the cost. But I wouldn't have spent much for it. However, it seems well like by other reviewers. I guess I just prefer something more along the lines of a rabbit or the Wee Vibe."
4,Ok in a pinch...,"This little guy works ok. I was expecting a little more ""zap"" but it gets the party started non-the-less."
5,Doc Johnson works as advertised,"Even with all the reviews on how well this product works, it worked better than anticipated. My lady may replace me!!"
1,Broken,"It worked at first, then the switch began to fail. Changing the battery didn't solve the problem. I had it about a month. Now....this thing no longer works. I have no idea why.Maybe water got in while being washed. The top of it kind of separated, so maybe it allowed water to seep in.Why make a product like this that cannot be washed or that isn't at least partially immersable in water?Now, tell me, is it something that I can return to get my money back? I think not.Don't waste your money on it."
2,Not what you might think,"Great for feet massage or neck massages, but not much else. Hard plastic shell, very angular."
3,Not bad but...,"Not bad but not great either. For me, it's not quite strong enough. It feels nice, sure, but doesn't have the muscle to put me over the edge. May be better for someone new to exploring the toy box, heh, but personally I am a little disappointed and after hearing so many great things about it, I expected more."
3,Eh..,"My first vibrator I had died after a year. So I needed something new and read the reviews on the pocket rocket. Although they seem good, I disagree. This vibrator takes me almost an hour to get off, where as the first one I had only took 15 minutes. I'd reccomend this as a starter, but not for someone who is looking for a little more power."
1,Not Worth it,"We had an egg before, and the egg was a lot more silent, and worked better for producing orgasms than this device."
2,It pisses me off.,"The three beads on the tip pisses me off. I can never hit the clit on the right spot. It's 3/4 width just doesn't make sense when it's built to vibrate a very small organ.I learned that it needs to be dried off very well. I washed it and left it aside to air dry. A few weeks later the beads started to rust. I've tried washing it again but it was permanent.Simple, vibrating is strong. But it's easily corrosive."
2,Vibe is NOT fast enough for me,I like that it is small but my 2 speed vibrator goes way faster than the pocket rocket. It took like 15-20 min to get me off when i expected to feel it within 5-10 min like my 2 speed vibrator. I wish i could get my money back but i already used it. Can I still return it and get a full refund?
3,Wish it was cheaper.,Purchased on in the past (10 years ago) Motor was not as strong as an off brand that I had.
1,Pocket Rocket does not run,"Doc Johnson The Original Pocket Rocket 4-Inch Ivory VibratorThis thing worked well for 2 sessions, then the motor quit. DON'T BUY!! Would welcome troubleshooting advice. Otherwise do not waste your money..."
5,THE ZONDERVAN TOPICAL BIBLE,"Most comprehensive Bible study help available. Exhaustively cross referenced, it is an open door of invitation to Bible study and comprehension. It combines all the best features of a Bible dictonary, concordance, handbook, and commentary. It places in your fingertips pertinent data and unusual information about every verse and every subject dealth with in the Bible. It is a ""summary of the Bible"" prepared topically. Anyone who diligently searches the Scriptures will find THE ZONDERVAN TOPICAL BIBLE an invaluable tool in understanding and applying the great Bible truths and themes to contemporary life."
3,ok,"nothing much to say about having bought some tye down with a beautifull green color, that come whit a cutter mold on the pack"
5,Catch it while ya can,This CD is definitely worth listening to. The catchy lyrics mixed with the groovable tunes makes makes getting to work alot easier even in rush hour traffic.
1,The Buccaneer,"I enjoyed this movie when it first came out in theaters. When the chance came to buy it on a blue ray dvd, I jumped on it. I purchased it from the Critic Choice Catalog via land line. When I received the video it had no sound for the main feature. I then sent it back and received another copy of the same movie. It also did not have sound. I have never had problems with Critics Choice before, therefore it must be with the manufacturer. Critics Choice states they will give me a refund.Patrick"
1,Love the movie...but,"I have treasured this movie since seeing it years ago! Could not wait until it came out in DVD BlueRay. However, the DVD I received was defective. No sound came once the movie started. I returned the first one and the replacement did the same thing. I tried the movie on all three of my BlueRay Players, but did not work. Might be a defective batch, so be warned."
3,typical demille stagey but colourful.,"i hesitated to buy this movie after reading a scathing review of the picture quality,but its actually not that bad, a little soft but definitely bluray quality.the film itself is a typical stagey, stolid, demille production even though it was directed by his son in law anthony quinn . Its so rich in colour and drama however that you cant help enjoying it.the film has been critised for its obvious sets, all demille films were pretty much like this,(the ten commandments looks really fake in bluray)but if you can accept yul brynner in a wig,and sailing ships that dont seem to move,you should be entertained by this slice of hollywood hokum, and remember it was made fifty four years ago!!!"
1,Terrible,The problem with this dvd is that there is no audio track present at all. The video is great. However it is a silent film.
5,Great histirocal film,This film is about privateer Jean Lafitte and The Battle Of New Orleans in the War of 1812. I watched this video in my social studies class because we are doing a unit on the War of 1812. This film is very accurate with great details on the war.
2,A Disgrace to the good name of Paramount and Demille!,"I saw this version, the remake, first, then the original. Ever since I saw the 1938 original I haven't been able to sit through this one. Compared to the '38, this one has NO adventure whatsoever. Clair Bloom is terrible, trying to be something she ain't. The story isn't completely told, missing a few vital scenes that are found in the original 1938 swashbuckler starring Frederic March and Franciska Gaal. If you've seen this, or want to my advice: watch the original instead, the original is a six star epic!"
4,Historically relevant and correct.,"While doing a college thesis in the 50's I saw this film for the first time. Yes it is entertaining and action filled, with excellent casting and actors. But my point in this review is that I checked the accuracy of historical accounts with the facts of the film, and I was amazed how well correlated they were. The story brings out once again how we can be prisoners of the past. Yet we all want to appear to be good, but fate is often against us. A final comment -- if it doesn't give away the plot: We may well owe our freedom today in part to the willingness of a pirate and his men to come to the aid of this country when there was a critical need. History buffs ought to enjoy this film. It is colorful, realistic and filled with suspence."
5,Classic movie you'll love this,In technicolor with a great story and cast. Great battle scenes. Reminds me of Captain Horation Hornblower with Gregory Peck. They just don't make'm like this anymore
4,The Buccaneer,I enjoyed the movie very much and would recommend it to everyone. It tells of a several great heroes of the war of 1812 and of the battle for New Orleans. The parts played by Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston were superb. It it a classic movie with lots of action and suspense.
1,Boot leg,"DVD received was not the movie I purchased. DVD looked as it should until I played it. Totally different movie, not happy I received a bootleg disc. Returned it right away"
3,U. S History period 3,"Another review mentions the fact that there are not that many films on the War of 1812, and because why. The fact that Americans don't like being the ""bad guys"", I believe is a silly reason. There are many movies where the United States go to war and portray their true war side. The Buccaneer was a movie about victory and love. Yul Brynner plays the role of Jean Laffitte, a pirate who comes to help the United States when the British attack New Orleans. Charlton Heston, who plays General Andrew Jackson, was great. I think that his witty, in charge, demanding role came out beautifully. Having studied Andrew Jackson in junior high school, his role (to me) is a difficult one to recreate. This was a great movie and I recommend it greatly to any old, wartime buff."
3,Bad sound and video quality...,"This blu-ray is an insult.There is absolutely nothing on the disk except the film.The sound is not even sterio.Nothing came out of any of my speakers except the center channel.There is no option for selecting sound.There is no option for close-caption.Olive Films has found another customer who will never buy another of their products.If you want this film, stick with the DVD and save some money!The Buccaneer [Blu-ray]"
4,Yul Rules,"This is for the Olive Blu-ray. This is a remake of the 1938 Cecil B. DeMille movie that starred Frederic March. Viewers will argue over which version was better, but both are wonderful IF you like C. B. DeMille movies. They both have all the best, and worst, of his ""showmanship"".I have the black & white 1938 movie on an Olive DVD, and the 1958 remake on their Blu-ray. Both are surprisingly good. Anthony Quinn was in the '38 as an actor and he directs the '58. It is the only movie he ever directed. Yul Brynner is good as Jean Lafitte. The plot is very similar in both movies with only the survivor of a pirate raid changing from a Dutch maid in the original to a boy, and Lafitte's love interest becomes the Governor's daughter in the remake. As Inger Stevens plays the daughter, this is a nice change. A good, beautiful actress who died way too young.The Olive Blu-ray is well done in widescreen and color and is almost the same price as the DVD. It is worth the price."
5,Excellent book for traveling to Italy,"Great book for learning how to get around in Italy. I am currently using this book in a nightschool I am currently going to, and it is helping out greatly!!!!!"
3,Textbook for my class,This is the textbook for my community italian class. It isn't very good for someone who doesn't know Italian. It's mostly dialogue.
3,A brave attempt but thematically and mathematically flawed,"It is probably impossible to make the topics accessible to readers without mathematical training. This is a brave attempt, however the exposition contains many mathematical mistakes in the form of claims that are false. A example of this is the pervasive confusion between closed and compact, a mistake which makes the relevant theorems wrong as stated. A less damaging problem is the tangental to disconnected material in each section. These tangents are hardly related to the topic."
2,Attempts to excite readers about modern maths...it fails.,"Neat idea, but look elsewhere. I love maths, and I didn't like the book. Other books on modern maths are better. A good example is ""Strategic Thinking"" - by Dixit and Nalebuff. Dixit's book analysed the same concepts as those in the first chapter of this book. Dixit's book is clearer, more exciting, and better explained. On these dimensions Casti's book fails, badly. Don't buy."
3,If you love math and have free time...,"While I think that this is one of the best introductory texts with regard to twentieth century mathematics, a person has to be willing to spend some significant time studying some of the chapters in order to make any sense out of it. I understood the Minimax and Halting Theorem chapters because I'm familiar with the material, but the rest of it was a little over my head for the amount of time I was willing to invest. I think that if you are really into math, this book will seem too simple, and if you aren't, it won't seem valuable. Three stars because the effort was there."
5,Inspiring dash through 20th century breakthroughs,"I found the text an inspiration. On one level, the material is fascinating. At another, you have to be impressed with Casti's ability to compress complex subjects into short essays. I've never seen anything comparable. Casti's presentation of game theory and topology are audacious. I've spent a lot of time with the 'Halting Problem' and disagree with a variety of conclusions Casti draws, but the clarity of presentation makes it a 'must read'."
1,Psuedo-philosophy,"This text is hardly a survey of the philosophy of science. There is much inconsistency and personal bias in the presentation of ideas in philosophy of science which leads me to think it was written by graduate students. In particular, Ladymans presentation of Kuhns philosophy is problematic.I hope the second edition shows more open mindedness."
4,Farther along / songs of the South,"All songs a great pick. However, the song, ""Farther Along,"" was best sung by the performer in the movie, ""Winter's Bone."" Would like to hear more songs from her.BF"
4,The Author Should had come with book,This was an easy book to pick up and read plus also pick up and understand. I basically tought myself Dreamweaver. The program without the book I would be impossible to learn. I just wished an instructor came with the book because I am a person who learns easier when visually instructed. Other that that excellent product
4,A Great Naruto Game,"If you like ninjas,cartoons,or fighting games,this is the game for you! Naruto Clash of Ninja 2 for NGC is awesome. NCON2 features 23 total characters, a new 4-player mode, a longer story mode, and much more.The characters include:Naruto,Saska,Sakura,Kakashi,Iruka,Guy,Haku,Zabuza,Shicamaru,Ino,Neji,Hinata,Lee,Kiba/Akamaru,Kankura/Crow,Gaara,and others.As you can see,if you're considering buying this,BUY IT!P.S. It's rated T cause' it's a fighting game."
3,good job JVC,this is a nice job from JVC . the picture quality is good and the sound is clear . the problem i faced so far is with night shots .but overall a good buy .
2,"""It is not wath ones hope""",It is not stops nascent.The information that it has is very complete for the people who have been long time within the magic. Some materials are not easy to find. There are prepared better books.
3,Not a Typical Review,"I've never studied, have not a desire to study any type of ""magic"" or ""witchcraft"". I don't know any thing about it to even discuss anything further. My only question is, why are so many of the responses related to ""magic"" and ""witchcraft?"" I just love essential oils, incents, and have an interest in possibly saving alot of money...is this normal??Concerned"
4,A Great Book,"I am not Wiccian, but I have just started into aromatherapy. A friend recommended this book. I was a bit skeptical when I seen the cover (Goddess making an offering). But boy was I Wowed when I read it.Thanks Scott!"
2,This is an Ok Book!,This book could be better if it had more info on the Herbs and oils! It just keeps repeting it's self like a parrot. The Brews and such have Items that are VERY HARD to find and some are rather unplesant smelling to boot! We were quite dissapointed in this book as it just isn't what we had hoped for!
4,Mother Earth's Majik,"I am discovering the enjoyment and knowledge from this book. I think the forklore is interesting, but since I have just begun I feel this book will be a winter project to create some of the oils and such the I would would like to make."
5,An integral part of every New Age library,"It doesn't matter whether you are into magick or not, this book is a must for everyone of the chosen people who love incense, oils, herbs, etc. I know plenty of non-witches who bought this book and still use it after years. It's everything from A to Z about Incense, Oils, Brews, Bath salts, Sacehts, Powders, Amulets, etc. If you want to enjoy the power of fragrance in your life, or to incorporate it into your magick- this book is for you.And for the wiccans, Druids, and Shamans of you, this book is a MUST, period. This book also features lots of correspondences for all the stuff that's enlisted in this awesome book. If you've always wanted to make incense, mix oils, or create brews, powders, and bath salts and sachets- you'll love this book, which to my knowledge is the most comprehensive book on the market. The ""Add to Cart"" button is up there, why havn't you pressed it yet?"
5,Essential for any Wiccans library,"As are all Scott Cunninghams books, this book is essential for all wiccans, eclectic, it goes with all traditions. You will love it."
1,Terrible Book,This book was written before much was known about incense making. The recipes contain Salt Peter which is never used by makers of quality incense. It creates Nitrous Oxides when burned.
4,"Incense, oils, and brews","I love this book. I have used it for years. It gives simple directions to make great incense, magickal oils, and other herbal concoctions. It is no means the end all, be all, but still a great reference point."
4,Invaluable Reference Work,"This book belongs in every occultist's library. Cunningham has left no stone unturned in his presentation of correspondences and substitutions. The book consists of several sections, each devoted to a specific topic, i.e., incenses, soaps, oils, brews, etc. Each section is alphabetically subdivided by purpose, astrological and plantetary influences, etc. Included for the adventurous are some recipies from older grimoires, along with safer modern blends aimed at the same goals. The incense chapter alone is worth the price of the book. After reading it, you'll never be dependent upon headshop joss sticks and cones again. Also included is a listing of sources for materials. In short, this book is an invaluable reference work, and belongs on every practicing magicians's bookshelf."
3,Good Primer,"Not a bad book for those starting out with herbs and oils and the like. Easy to follow instructions and tips, typical of Cunningham's style. A good starting place to learn how to make your own items. Some of the recipes are quite impractical though."
4,informative,"Arrived quickly and in good shape thank you!!!!! This book has answered allot of questions and has given a better understanding of the various mixtures and substitution and the armada of tools needed for making MY incense witch is why I started making incense in the first place the scent I want for various times, places, events, and this book will help me do that. I see this for anyone interested or thinking about making their own incense.Nick"
4,Good basic reference,"If you are building your own collection of books on herbs, oils, etc., this is an excellent book for that collection.I'll use it to create herbal gifts and I'll use it to guide the plantings in my own herb garden. Gardeners plan in the winter months. :-)"
2,There are better books,"For information on incense there are simply much better resources than this book. Today, there is even better information available free on internet. My recent favorite is Gina Hyams new book, and of course Kiyoko Morita's ""The Book of Incense."" Suzanne Fischer-Rizzi writes a great book also."
4,"Better than some, not as good as others...","Cunningham is in his element when he writes of beliefs, but when he writes (or writes with help, or is invoked) about other stuff, it tends to be less good.I'd recommend this book highly because it's the best book on the subject of oils and the rest, but, at the same time, how often do you use this stuff? I think another author should have a go...It's better than the similar ones on herbs and gems, though!"
4,ANOTHER CUNINGHAM WINNER,THIS ISNT A PERFECT BOOK BUT IT HAS A LOT OF GREAT LITTLE PROJECTS. THERE ARE OTHER BOOKS FOR INCENSE AND FOR OILS BUT THIS ONES STILL GOT A WARM PLACE IN MY HEART. I CAN READ CUNINGHAM BOOKS ALL DAY BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE WRITES. NO COLLECTIONS COMPLETE WITHOUT THIS BOOK.
4,Slightly misconcepted,"I like this book a alot, I read it almost everyday learning new things. I should't complain bout the book, because I got it cheap, but maybe next time, instead of saying only a few pages had been highlighed or marked u should have said 89% was. The entire book was covered in pink highlighter. I could have bought one used for the same price without any highlighting."
5,Wonderful Book to Learn Herbs,I have always wanted to learn more about the herbs we have. I had joined an online center to learn more. This was one of the books I needed for my class. I love this book. The information in it is written in a way that is easy to understand and easy to learn by. I would say this is a much needed book if you are wanting to learn more about herbs. Must have for your library!!!!
4,"Excellent, but.....",An excellent book that is well worth having in your library. Its only shortfall is the lack of background information on many of the more difficult to obtain and/or less common herbs. A list of common substitutions for these rarer herbs would also be useful.
4,A classic restated in a memorable way,"Joe Henderson fluidly explores a Gershwin classic, the opera Porgy and Bess, unfolding the lines of one of America's greatest composers playfully and skillfully.Henderson employs talented musicians (including himself) to sketch a beautiful rendition of this haunting story. Most Gershwin phrases are memorable, but this retelling is even more enchanting.It is a wonderful CD, enhanced magnificently by Chaka Khan's exquisite work on ""Summertime.""If you like smooth, sophisticated sounds, this CD is for you."
3,Pretty Darned Sportin',I searched for this album simply for the rendition of There's a Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon for New York. Turns out the entire CD is tight. Recommended for fans of Porgy.
3,Who is Norman Spinrad,"Norman Spinrad is one of the best writers of the 1970's. His novel Bug Jack Barron is considered one of the 100 best SF books of all time. This is one of his first novels and as such is a precursor of the technique and themes appearing in later books. I would buy this book. But then again, I know a book with Spinrad's name on it will not be a waste of time or money."
2,pretentious,"I've now read this book, and to be honest, don't find it to be worth a lengthy review. Spinrad proposes three social forces in conflict - the Hegemony, the Democratic League, and the ""chaotic"" Brotherhood of Assassins - and populates each with two-dimensional stick-figure heroes and villains. It's ok if you are into lasgun assaults under plasteel domes on Mercury, but it's not the philosophical conflict of ideas that it pretends to be. No way it was ""the great science-fiction novel now an underground classic in colleges all across America"".At times it can be just ridiculous; for example, when the first intersteller probe comes back from Cygnus 61, everyone sits around waiting for the film to come back from the lab. And a secret agent travels to Mercury under cover as a business man deciding whether to relocate his desk calculator manufacturing plant there, as if that makes economic sense. Sheesh."
4,Where are the women?!?,"Wasn't that line in Star Trek somewhere along the way? I enjoyed reading it but I wondered offhand whether the Hegemony sought to diminish chaos by eliminating women? Except, men and women were herded to see the initial speech and then after that...? I can see a novel without a main female character but I would still expect to see a female pronoun along the way, a technician, a specific mention among the crowds, something?The unclimactic climactic ending, the rather commonplace (today)Ultimate Chaotic Act, dated it heavily in light of 911-01, Palestinian and Iraqi suicide bombers, etc."
2,Disappointed,"We've had the printer for about a year and have been very pleased with the quality of the prints. The borderless 4x6 prints are very nice. I was somewhat concerned with the flimsy lever mechanism for switching between the two print trays. Well sure enough, the lever broke. Now I can't switch between the two trays. Initially this was not a huge problem because we could still manually pull the 4x6 tray in and out. However, now after I've replaced an ink cartridge, it requires printing to 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper for callibration and won't recognize that I've pulled the 4x6 tray out. So now I'm out a printer (unless anyone has any suggestions)."
1,Engineered cheap,"I was very happy with the 7550 for one of my computers and after reading the discriptions for the 7660, I thought ""great - uses the same cartridges as the 7550"". What I didn't read in the discription was costly: it only holds two cartidges at a time-57 & 58- for color photos (the two cartridges in the box) or-57 & 56- for standard black & color printing which I will use most of the time, while the 58 sits in its caddy where it can dry out or get lost. Anyone wanna buy an almost new 7660 real cheap?"
2,It's dead,"I bought this 7660 in 2005 and overall it worked pretty well. Then all of a sudden the light next to the power button started blinking red. No error message as there is no display on the screen. Tried to follow HP's instruction for a hard reboot but if the green light is not on, it will not allow you to remove the ink cartridges as required. Got online with a service tech and was told to buy another printer. I will get a Canon."
1,BEWARE! HP will not admit that this is a faulty product - read on...,"I bought this printer with high hopes in the summer of 2004. Thought it was the best thing ever. A month later, I got the 'cartridge error' which isn't a cartridge error at all, it's a faulty cable. They sent me a free one. Same EXACT thing happened to my friend who bought the printer a couple weeks after me - sent her a new cable, all was well - for about a month. Still under warranty, they sent her another cable and it worked again. All was well with mine until yesterday. No longer under warranty (I think a printer should last longer than a year - my Lexmark is seven years old!) Now they want to charge me for a new cable! Over $40. This is a lemon and I am pursuing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Search online - you'll find other EXACTLY the same complaints."
3,I just bought it--and it doesn't work!,"I just bought this item (from Circuit City) and it doesn't work from the start! I already emailed HP for support and hopefully I'll get some advice as to how to ""fix it"". But I plan to return to this item and replace it with the same type. I know HP is good in quality as well as longetivity. I plan to keep this item and I'll write another review as to how it goes."
5,Awesome Photos,"If you are looking for an affordable photoprinter, not a fast text printer, this is the one.I have a 2 year old printer at home printing digital photos at 2400x1200 dpi. I printed the same photo on both my old printer and the hp 7660 at max resolution and wow the colors in the hp printer are more vivid and accurate. The photo felt more life like, similar to film prints.The draw backs are you can not refill the ink cartridges, and you have to switch between black and the photo cartridges. It is slow printing text pages compared to a dual roll printer like a deskjet.In summary if you want a great photo printer at a reasonable price this one is it, if you want to print say 24 page documents all the time buy another printer. This was designed to be a photo printer, not a document printer."
5,Amazing Printer -- great quality prints!!!,"I bought the printer, installed it and started using it immediately. Didn't run into any installation problems with the software.Pros: Amazing print quality, photos come out with NO graininess at all. Couldn't be happier with its high quality printing. Also prints very fast in draft and normal modes. The flash memory reader is useful -- I use it more to copy files from it to my computer, rather than print direct.Cons: I've done a lot of web-site printing, but I can't help but think the color print cartridge ran out fairly quickly. Printer doesn't come with USB cable -- but that seems to be par for the course. Printer handles envelopes ok -- not great.I'm extremely happy with my printer, especially given the affordable price (pre-lifetime cartridge spending...)."
4,7660 hp printer,"LIke this printer. However it takes awhile to figure out how to make the photo type quality prints because it is old. But my favorite old printer (hp 7150) broke and I had 3 expensive ink cartridges. I am a mac user and an artist so I have some high standards for my printouts. I figured out the 7660 had to be set on ""printer features"" in the printing layout or presets area of the software you are using. I print from PhotoShop, other graphics and MS Office software products. I do not print directly some smart cards or camera into the printer. Has a lot of nice features for the price i paid. I really love the OLD HP color printers. They are very very cheap. You can find many of them for sale with unopened ink cartridges which make them a real deal. I'd be careful however if you don't buy one that is ""like new"" or call the merchant."
2,Paper size errors,"Prints wonderfully, but I have problems with the software. I keep getting errors specially, ""Paper size errors"" when everything is set up correctly and the paper is located where it has to be. I cant get rid of this error.It also does some strange thing: it always tries to start printing from the last page. It tends to do that, when reconnected to a computer. I am not sure if it's the software or just the printer sending wrong messages (sounds like the second is the problem). My mother in law bought this printer new and she spent like 400 or 500 dollars on it. They dont produce it anymore, I wonder why that happened so fast. Dont buy this printer. I am sure there are others out there to print pictures that dont have so many issues."
1,Carriage stuck.,"The quality of pictures is very good. However, the carriage gets stuck on the left margin and there is no solution, outside of replacement of printer. The lever to insert photo size paper is poorly designed and break easily, leaving one to hand feed paper."
4,This printer is Great!,"This printer prints out wonderful pictures. I'm very happy with it. I have had no problems whatsoever. I think the people that had problems possibly had a bad batch. No product is perfect. But as far as I'm concerned, mine is great!!"
2,"Nice blade, but doesn't fit as stated","I ordered this wiper for the rear window on a Volvo V70 (2004). Amazon/Bosch guide says it should fit. It does not. The Volvo has what appears to be a non-standard rear wiper mount, and the Bosch appears to use the standard J hook connection.I was able to remove the wiper insert from the Hindsight and install it into the existing Volvo wiper bracket. So far, it seems to work fine. The price is right, and low enough to make returning not worth it.Bosch and/or Amazon needs to check its fitment guide, however."
2,not good,"This blade is on the rear window of my SUV, presumably what it's made for. Even though it's supposed to ""fit"" per amazon, the top 3 or 4 inches of the blade barely contact the window, so it does a poor job of wiping that area, which is significant. I'd expect this rear wiper blade to account for some curvature in the glass. Initially I thought it might need a break-in period, but this is over a year old and still works just as poorly as when I first bought it. I've got other Bosch blades on the front (Excel) and those are great."
3,Kool keith - dr Octagon II,"The opening track is one of the finest tracks on this album it is very reminiscent of dr Doom ""First Come First Served"" deep acid beats, clear vocals and sharp lyrics. Granted this is one of the weaker Albums that Keith has done there are still some nice tracks like ""New York City"" ""the original"" ""Lyrical Magic"". It's not ""ecolygist"" but it is Kool keith and if your a fan this is another must from the archives."
1,Aweful. There's a reason it was not supposed to be released!,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. I bought this album because I was a fan of Dr. Octagynacologist. But there's not 1 song on this whole album worth listening to. I'm sry, I'm a kool keith fan... But there's a reason it was not supposed to be released! STAY AWAY!!"
1,GHB is DANGEROUS!!,"I cannot believe this book exists! I was given this drug (unknowingly) along with some minimal alcohol (2 beers). The result??? I lost control of my body, unable to respond to anything, and rapidly slipped into a state of unwakeable 'sleep.' This lasted for about 4-5 hours. During this time I was sexually assaulted - I was raped because of this drug. GHB is under no circumstance a SAFE drug for ANYTHING!"
5,GHB: get it while you can; keep it legal,get as many copies as you can now. this is the only concise book on GHB and it is a wonderful book and substance . bookpeople has already stopped carrying it and the companies promoting ghb have gotten pressure from FDA to shut down
5,"You can Overdose on Water also, I love our country of validating Big Brother's need to take care of us all.","GHB is as addictive as the addictive patterns and behavior's as the individual using it. Our government latches on to any justification for Control and justifying it's existence, yes we all pay a price for stupid people and the biggest price is that those who are capable of using this drug responsibly are penalized by idiots. Also to address the Rape issue..YOU CAN BE RAPED WITHOUT GHB, JUST SO YOU KNOW, IN CASE YOU COULDN'T FIGURE THAT OUT."
3,A good book on the subject,A very interesting look at GHB. Check out the site in this bookManifesto of Mass 4if you want a natural alternative that works.
2,Fluffy book sourced with National Enquirer articles,"Here's a real-review:*The first 100 pages are about how her mother made her get a nose job that when wrong.*The second 100 pages are about the Frankenstein movie.*The last 90 pages are about every movie-star that's ever gotten cosmetic surgery.And the whole thing is stitched together with an English teacher's weekend theory on how a mix of ""Simulations and Simulacra"" + ""The Ego and the Id"" explain why people get cosmetic surgery. If you're someone who orders books online based on catchy titles, then do yourself a favor and skip this one. How can a book on cosmetic surgery not even talk about the golden ratio?"
3,Response to customer review,"The customer review for SAMSUNG DVD-TR520 DUAL DRIVE DVD RECORDER was very helpful in me determining whether to buy one. I was contemplating on buying a dual drive recorder for the purpose of recording DVD to DVD until I read his/her review. As I read the technical portion of it that this recorder only plays back Region 1, that may be the problem why the copy version does not play. If it copies from a region free DVR & it only records & play back on a Region 1 version, that could be the problem. I had that problem with my portable DVD player. In my research I found that I recorded from a region free disk but my portable recorder would only play back for Region 1 disk. I then had to buy a region free portable DVD player so I could play my recorded DVRs. Thanks to the customer review. Renee W."
1,Concern,"The greater concern with movies of this type are first, with the production studio and it's crew and what they stand for and second, with an audience that can rationalize their sadistic personalities through the usual abstract selective analysis of a film's supposed intricate qualities - acting, twists to the plot; psychological and sociological dissonance; emotional catharsis; story development, and so on.FF summary: It's just another torture flick in the same way (as was briefly pointed out by one of the characters in the movie) that some people, from childhood through adulthood, never come to terms with their sickness in enjoying the torture of anything weaker than themselves. The movie panders to the sadistic power of being the omnipotent viewer."
4,some things do stay the same,"The characters in this young adult novel are so wonderfully alive! Shy but determined Jean, Johnny the adorable snake-in-the-grass, and Homer the science nerd (but not so nerdy that he doesn't ask Jean for a good-night kiss!), and Jean's sensible sister Sue and straight-arrow parents make this an interesting read. Yeah, yeah, it's set in the 50's! So what?--kids today will be both intrigued and amused by the retro references. And, it would make a great grandparent/teen together read: The grandparent could explain all the freaky references, like girls-only sewing classes in high school, and how car ownership for a teenager back then was even more of a status symbol than it is today.This is tame enough for 5th and 6th graders to read; at that age, they are definitely interested in what adults (read ""teens"") do, even if they don't quite want to enter the adult world just yet."
3,Clever stuff,"The Tenth Man (like the superior Ask the Awakened) is a collection of short essays, poetry and dialogues expressing Wei Wu Wei's profound understanding of Ch'an, Taoist and Advaita philosophies.The writing is abstruse, uncompromising and very challenging at times.For sure there is insight to be found. But too often the cleverness gets in the way."
4,Advaita and Ramana with spicy juice,"This book by Wei Wu Wei is one of those abstract writing from this famous author and student of Advaita,Tao and Buddhism that should be read and contemplated upon very slowly.He draws heavily from Bhagavan Ramana of Thiruvannamalai or Thiru and for those familiar with Ramana's teaching, this book refreshes their memory/understanding.If you are not familiar with Ramana's teaching, read some other books [such as those by Paul Brunton or Arthur Osborne] before touching this book.If you have specific doubts on Ramana's methods [such as ""who am I "" enquiry] this book can help to clarify such doubts....For casual reading , who knows, one line in this book may trigger deep thoughts.An essential book for those deeply involved in Advaita----either classical Indian tradition or ""satsangh"" circuit neo-advaitins!"
5,A spiritual classic...,"It is very hard to describe this book, but suffice it to say that Wei Wu Wei clearly understood the ""negative way"" he writes about in this book (part of a series of outstanding books including ""Ask The Awakened""by this mysterious mystic)."
1,Terrible Paul Newman Movie,"One of the only movies I actually had to turn off. Paul Newman was just plain silly beyond belief, as well as the story line.Total waste of talent."
4,"Wartime comedy along the lines of ""Hogan's Heroes ""","This film is a very funny comedy similar to some of the 60's wartime shows that aired on tv in the same decade. It is a lighthearted tale that certainly does not warrant the ""R"" rating which it has. This is a comedy that does not offend anyone and contains no foul language, and is tame by todays standards. If you liked the 60's TV shows like ""Hogan's Heroes"" or the 70's ""MASH"", you are sure to enjoy this movie. Paul Newman is excellent in this rare comedy performance."
5,Great movie.,Exactly what I ordered. Glad it was finally out on DVD. Great movie. A relatively unknown movie that is fun and well done.
4,Abbey Lincoln picks her Dinah Washington favourites,"As the liner notes state, this is a ""'Best Of' collection with a difference."" Abbey Lincoln, one of today's greats has selected her Dinah Washington favourites. There is nothing too esoteric here, but hearing Dinah sing ""Cold, Cold Heart"" is well worth the price of admission. The liner notes give us Abbey's take on Dinah and the songs. It is interesting to read what one great singer hears when another great singer sings."
5,Funnier than the first,My family (that's 10 people whose ages range from 4-40) watched this movie all together and everyone loved it. Agent Cody Banks 2 is hilarious. Cody is put undercover as a music student in London to stop a former teacher of his from using mind control to conquer the world. The action parts were really neat and although the story line itself was a little corny it was still very enjoyable.
2,A Big Disapointment,"After loving the first film I saw this terrible sequel. Relizing the potintial of a series I was exited about this movie. Good thing I did not pay money for this! From minute one it was bad, bad cast, bad charectors, bad Bad Guys,and bad story(How many times has mind control been done). Avoid this sequal."
2,Worse than the first,"The first one was cute, this is horrible. Cody's 'handler', Derek is a goofball. I would've wished they would've gotten someone else. The jokes fall flat, the villians are stupid, and the plot is worse than the first. Totally predictable with no surprise."
4,GOOD!,"This movie is good! I'm gonna give this 4 stars because the begginning could have been a bit better. But apart from that it was perfect! The action was great! It was also sometimes funny!Note to Frankie: Frankie, I think you do an excelent job acting in everything! You are my most favorite actor ever! Keep it up!!"
5,Great Movie,"This movie was awesome! It was so funny, especially the part with the mentos. Hannah Spearritt did an awesome job! <much better than hilary> Good Movie, better then first"
2,Not surprising that there weren't any more after this one,"This time, teen agent Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) is on the trail of a former spy instructor who has gone rogue with the intention of using a mind control microchip to create world-wide chaos.The first film had its moments but was generally a pretty mediocre affair. This sequel is painfully uninspired and over-the-top without being very funny. The beginning sequence that introduces Camp Woody, the school for young spies, is amusing, and Anthony Anderson is funny. Nothing else quite works."
2,2 1/2 stars,"Okay okay, no need for a deep analysis with big words. We know what it is and we know what we're in for, a teenage cop-com that is just for a bit of light entertainment.Cody Banks is a run of the mill teenage heroine, the story is standard Hollywood, though is a bit interesting. Hannah Spearritt has a paltry role that seems mainly to serve the purpose of having a pretty girl in the movie. However, some of the side actors are quite interesting, especially wise-cracking Derek, and the multi-cultural music group Cody studies with in England.Stock standard but a decent movie for watching if nothing else is available."
2,Not nearly as good as the first one,"I bought this largely because I liked the first one, and also because I thought there might be some good footage of London. I really cannot recommend it, though. It seems to be one of those sequels which was just trying to make a few extra bucks from the legacy of the first film."
3,Agent Cody Banks 2 Destination London,Pretty good movie for kids and adults...a bit of violence but the gadgets are fun for kids. Some rough language should have been left out as there was no need for it.
3,Agent Banks in London,"Not as good as the first one. The introduction of goofy idiotic characters (the inventor and the doctor) just makes this movie worse. The gadgets introduced are pretty interesting. The plot was ok but the delivery was faulty. The chase and action scenes were pretty good. The movie was somewhat ok. Now, did we really have to have the Queen dancing?! The Swiss Army Knife part was pretty funny."
4,AMAZINGLY GOOD AND BETTER THAN YOU WOULD THINK!,Once again the pint sized James Bond does it again and better than most films of this nature. Who would of thought?.............The DVD transfer is good and worth checking out.
4,One of her best!,"I have been looking for this CD for seveal years now and this is the only place I have found that has it and it is out of stock. Come on. Bring it back. I love ""Baby Get Lost"". It is my favorite song on this CD. I actually have the original LP -- yes -- I said LP."
4,Out of print on Compact Disc,"Unfortunately, this reissue (expanded) was always meant to quickly go out of print. Again, unfortunately, Universal hasnt full realized the value of compressed digital downloads à la Amazon MP3 Downloads. They have the potential to make every piece of recorded music available for sale. The majors just won't get it until consumers go commando on them (again)."
1,WARNING: Trash,"This is one of the worst movies, Ive ever seen and blew my money on. The costume is retarded and acting sucks. I mean damn, didn't they see the Roger Patterson film. The big-foot in this film looks like a cross between a gorilla/vampire with bad acne.I'm warning you,it's not worth your time and money."
5,Best yet!,"Having used other JVC cameras, this is the best yet. Color view finder is not necessary as using the 3.5 Led is great. Especially for those with challeged eyes/More features than most amature users will ever need. Easily to use features makes even the teenagers happy.What more can we say!"
5,Great,"This was a new product, plays well, happy with purchase. All is good. Thanks so much my son loves it!"
4,Why go cheaper?,"Basketballs last a long time and are not expensive. Why would you want to save $10 and get a cheap ball when you can get this great basketball. Lots of feel, limited ""slippage"", and true bounces. I should have purchased two of these so that everyone isn't fighting over ""the good ball"" when going for rebounds. (if you don't know what I mean than you might as well purchase a cheap ball)"
4,Solid Value,"My son needed a new basketball - and after checking out different balls - we went with this Spalding. He likes the grip and feel of the ball. So far he has only used it indoors, and he likes the bounce he gets from the wood floors when he's dribbling. Would definitely recommend."
2,Not Really an Outdoor Ball,"The exterior of the new spalding balls get roughed up quickly when used on an outdoor court.I had an older Zi/O from the late 90s and used it fairly often... until buying two new balls this year (spalding zi/o and a spalding tacksoft). The Zi/o ball has panels that are starting to peel slightly (not peeling severely but the black underneath the orange panels is visible on two panels) after about 8 months of rare use. And the tacksoft looks like I've been playing with it for multiple years, after about 2 months of heavy use.Both the Zi/O and the Tacksoft seem like good bargains for INDOOR balls and have great grips, but they aren't made for outdoor use cause the grip wears quickly on both balls. Spalding needs to step its game up."
5,Real good ball,I've used the ball for several weeks now and it has performed well. The surface has a good grip to it which makes it easy to handle. The ball is light with a nice bounce so you don't have to put too much effort into dribbling. All around this is an excellent basketball for both indoor and outdoor play. It isn't always the first one picked but has never been the last option!
1,"Wow went waaay down hill, total crap!!","I have purchased this ball before, a few years ago. And have tried several different ones throughout the years. This ball used to be a good top of the line outdoor ball. From day one the panels started coming up at the seams, I tried to ignore it for the most part. Also has a fake feel to the skin itself, channels are not too deep, and the grip itself gets slippery pretty easy. I have played for about 20 years, and have a pretty good feel for the game, primarily run PG and SG on the court so the feel of the ball is important to me as it is for many other players. I did not attempt to return this ball, I put a blade in it to end the misery, and so noone else would have to use such a crap ball.Should note that the previous ball I purchased was great, it lasted a long time and had a good feel. It's possible this one was a bad batch, but seemed to be doomed either way."
4,Good item,This it is a good article. I am satisfiedwith the article and the attention with the salesman.
1,Too delicate material,"The first day I went out for some outdoor shooting (last week) it got pinched in a harmless bushes. I felt it was too soft material since the very beginning, and now it is useless after a little scratch. I just wanted a durable ball and I was able to pay a good price for it. Anyone has a real recommendation for me?"
2,Returned it to the Store - Poorly Made in China,"When i noticed that a new spalding basketball doesn't compare to my older one - seems to be made of cheaper material, I brought it back to the vendor and told him I wanted one not made in china."
5,Spalding,Great ball has great air and control best in indoor court having a really great time with the ball thankyiu
3,Wouldn't use on rough outdoor surfaces,"This is a good ball. It has good feel and all. BUT! I really don't think that this should be labled as an outdoor ball. Mainly because of the fact that the materials really don't last a WHOLE long time before they scratch up and break down. Not putting down this ball or anything, because it's great for indoors...I just wouldn't recommend it outdoors. Thanks for your time!"
3,Misleading photographs of the ball. INFUSION or Zi/o?,"I have just bought the Zi/o in a brick and mortar store. The reason I did not buy from amazon is that there are two different balls pictured on this page for the Zi/o, and I did not want to end up receiving the wrong ball from amazon. If you look at the two pictures on top of this page, one of them shows a ball with 'INFUSION' written on it while the other one shows a ball with Zi/o on it.I think amazon should clear this ambiguity so customers know exactly which ball is going to be shipped to them. It's already hard enough to decide between different brands and models of basketball balls, and we do not need amazon making things even trickier by showing different balls under the same model name."
5,Great basketball for indoor/outdoor use,"I wanted a moderately priced ball to play outdoors at a nearby park during a brief 10 week stint in NYC so I scoured Amazon and was able to purchase this item for around $22.xx. To my surprise, the ball could actually work better as an indoor ball. It's no Wilson Evolution, but it is closer to a TF-1000 than one might imagine.I used it outdoors a few times and given that the court was a bit dirty, the ball caught a coat of dust and became a bit slippery at times. I'm looking forward to playing indoors again where I think the ball will excel.For the price and the quality of the ball, I definitely think this is a great purchase."
2,Good while it lasts,"Had it for about 2 years, and lately the leather cover is peeling off and doesn't hold air like it used to when new. Majority of use was indoors, so I know I haven't been rough with it. I don't know that the average life span of a basketball should be, but I'd consider paying a little more and getting one of better quality."
3,Spalding NBA Zi / O,This basketball has really good grip but its really hard to bounce. I tried pumping air into it but that did barley any thing. Over all this basketball is ok.
3,Nice Clock for the Living Room or Kitchen,"I was attracted to this analog alarm clock because of its looks and does not require batteries. However, the ticking sound from this clock is disturbing especially when I'm about to sleep. I was about to return it but decided to keep it because it looks good if placed in the living room and it can also be used as a kitchen alarm clock. You just need to wind this up every other day. Also at first, the alarm did not work. I need to shake, tap and turn the alarm knob several times to make it work. I will give it 4 stars if its price is $10 or less and 3 stars if its greater than $10."
5,Chaney Mechanical Alarm Clock,"After reading all the different viewpoints I wasn't sure what I'd get, but I have to admit this little clock is far beyond my expectations. Right out of the box the first winding for 24hrs it kept perfect time and it has remained so now ever since. The alarm is a pleasing gentle ring and wakes my wife, who is a sound sleeper. It isn't that loud but it told me, down the hall, when to take a cup of coffee in to her. This is, in my opinion, the best made and quality small bedside mechanical alarm clock on the market today. Oh yes, even for a light sleeper like myself, I find the gentle tick very pleasing. If you need a reliable method of waking when you do not have power or even when you do, this is the very clock for you. ColGilly"
2,Ok for the price.,"Nice item, good price, did not last AT ALL. It fell apart less than 6 months after I purchased it."
1,misleading !,"This item indicated that it included 3 discs, Wiggle Time/Dance Party/Hoop dee doo, but it really only included 1 disc, dance party. I paid $21.99 plus shipping for 1 very old dvd! Not happy!"
1,I give up!,I ordered this product and recieved only The Wiggles Dance Party DVD. I called up customer service and told them that I recieved only one of the videos. They were very nice and said that they would send me a replacement order at no charge. When I recieved the second package in the mail it too was just the Wiggles Dance Party DVD. I noticed that the label on the back was incorrect which is why I kept recieving the wrong DVD. I told this to customer service hoping that we could get this issue resolved. On my third shipment I again recieved only The Wiggles Dance Party DVD. I give up! My sons love the Wiggles and it's just disappointing that they couldn't take the time to fix this for me.
2,Amazon Verified Purchase,"The condition of the book was poor. I expected a slightly used, but clean product. It was well-used. The cover was worn in, pages dog-eared, and it was already highlighted throughout the book. I was disappointed."
2,Don't Be Like Carol,"I have read a couple of Melody Beattie's books at the insistence of my ex-girlfriend, who, unfortunately, is not too bright. First, Carol joined AA and got that weird smug look on her face - instead of going out and being with her real friends, she became addicted to the meetings! If she got upset because she was late for work, suddenly her ""alcoholism"" was to blame. By the way, I only saw her drunk twice in the two years we went out - hardly an alcoholic, although definitely not too tightly wrapped.Then, she decided she was codependent, and of course so was I, and now she had more pseudo-science to spout. She became unbearable and I dumped her ass. She still doesn't follow through on any plans, she still is inconsiderate and rude - these cult beliefs haven't done anything but given her all kinds of made up diseases to take responsibility for her bad actions.Glad I have moved on and don't have to read this silly stuff anymore."
2,Be careful! This book will strip your emotional well-being.,"I read this book in my 20s and it helped me quite a bit with dealing with the issues I had being an adult child of alcholic parents. It was suggested that I read it again by a psychologist because I am going through a divorce from a man that doesn't express his emotions well. At 40, the reading this time took me to the GATES OF HELL! I started questioning myself and who I actually was. It took my best friend to remind me that I wasn't all the things that my STBX was saying I was. His goal is to hurt me anyway that he can. As I said this book did help me in my 20s, but now as a 40 year old woman who has already dealt with her upbringing, it really messed me up for a few days. JUST BE CAREFUL."
5,Great customer service,"Great Customer service, there was an issue and it was easily resolved. Got book brand new and very happy with it."
3,Very worth while,Very good Book. It helped me understand myself so much better and the ones I am codependant with. Knowledge can be power in which we can change for the better. I was very glad I had ordered and can think of several others that would have interest in the contents of the book. May order others for gifts.
5,Codependent No More:How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself,"I am still reading this book, but I LOVE it so far. My therapist recommended I read it, and I wish I had read this booktwenty years ago. I believe my life would be far different if I had. It has opened my eyes to the troubling and persistentproblems I've had with all my relationships, both friendly and romantic in my adult life. I am glad I bought this bookbecause I am highlighting and underlining it like crazy! Do not think this book only applies to people who live with analcoholic. It doesn't."
4,very helpful,I am still in the process of reading this book but so far it has been an easy read. It's very easy to relate to and has already helped me tremendously to see that 1. I am not alone and 2. I am not crazy. Other people have had the same struggles and it is possible to come out on the other side.
4,Good book!,"This is a great book and can help with understanding co-dependency and self care.When I ordered it, it came in on time and is a brand new book never been used."
3,Easier to read than others,"If you are looking for a classic on codependence that is easy to read, than order this. You will not be disappointed."
4,Great,"I was surprised by the CD, and didnt really get into it until the 2nd one, which was where the messages were so much clearer about the book and its purpose. I have bought it for my sister hoping to help her on this journey of co-dependence on her husband."
4,just what I needed,"I am currently reading this book and loving it. I am taking a long time to finish it because it is so deep. It is easy reading, but in order to get much out of it you really have to read it slowly and of course change your wrong behavior, one step at a time. I like the fact that the author tells you that change does take time. It seldom happens overnight. Very comforting for someone who wants to see huge changes overnight. I also like that she encourages you to have a relationship with God. He is the only one whom we are supposed to be codependent with. Eveyone else is imperfect, just like me.."
4,Fast Service thru Amazon,Pleased with expedition of my order. The book has been helpful to the original purpose for ordering this title. I suggest it for anyone affected by addiction of those other than themselves.
4,Helpful for Many,"While I'm not sure that I'm a full-fledged co-dependent, I found this book really helpful. It helped me highlight some of the ways that I live for and through other people, rather than existing through my own experiences. Beattie helped me ""detach"" and bring some sanity to a relationship that was making me insane. Some of the personal stories in the book can be a little cumbersome, and I found myself skipping the ones that didn't apply to my personality. Overall though, this book is really insightful and taught me a lot about relationships and the ways I relate to others."
5,Codependent No More - EXCELLENT!!,This is an EXCELLENT book. I have read most of Melody Beattie's works and this is the best. It helped me tremendously and is a book I go back and read over and over again!! I have given this book to several friends and family members who are dealing with codependency issues and their votes are the same as mine. A must have!!
5,Truth Sets you Free!,Read this years ago when it came out and bought it for my daughter and son. Just some amazing truths to reset your North Star by?
4,very helpful,This book gave me great insight into my codependency and I should reread it every year to stay on track.
5,A wonderful book for healing ones self.,"Melodie Beattie is an author that not only speaks to people minds, she speaks to their understanding of life and ones choices. This book was given to me by my psycharist and it saved my life. Beattie understands the high and lows of life because she has been there, which makes her even more compelling to read"
5,Amazing,"This book is perfect for someone who wants to stop controling others, focus on thier own maturity and live in truth and reality!"
2,lacked anything practical,"This was an interesting book to read, and perhaps an appropriate introduction, but at the end I felt like I was wallowing in codependency, not moving on and learning practical ways to heal. This book merely identifies the problem, but fails move to the next step of becoming ""Codependent No More"".I felt this book was more theoretical than practical. Additionally, I don't like Beattie's overall philosophy, extracted from work with alcoholism, that once Codependent, Always Codependent.A better foundation for beginning to work through these issues has been one of continually self-awareness, healing and breaking old codependent habits.Instead of Beatie, I would recommend Breaking Free From the Codependency Trap, which provides a brief overview of codependency, but incredibly practical solutions for individuals, couples, therapy sessions and group therapy.Breaking Free of the Co-Dependency Trap"
2,Glad I didn't buy it. . .,"instead, I checked it out at my local library. It wasDEPRESSING (unnecessarily)! She said in 200 pages what could have been said in 50. Most of the ideas were repeated. If one is reading that book, they must have a pretty good idea they are co-dependent. Instead, she gives multiple check lists, vignettes, definitions. She never turns it around postively so you can benefit from the grueling experience (of reading her book). She also ""talks down"" to the reader, referring to herself frequently as a ""professional."" There are many professions in the world, many highly educated who are co-dependent."
4,codependent no more: How to stop controlling others and start caring for yourself,This is a fantastic book if your just going through the issues involved with someone who is dependent on drugs or alcohol. If you have been living with it for awhile and you have already experienced all the problems that go along with it. I will say it is good as far as confirming your feelings and what you have already done to take care of yourself. It is not very useful when you've already began the process of detatchment. I would recommend this book to anyone that is just descovering this problem. I just wish someone had mentioned this to me a couple of years ago. It would have been very useful then.
2,"Mostly for alcoholics, and religious/very spiritual types","This book is for alcoholics, or people who have had their lives damaged due to close relationships with alcoholics. And, the ""recovery"" from codependency is very much based on having faith in God. I am not an alcoholic, and am an atheist, so I cannot really recommend this book as a useful tool for unlearning codependency."
3,Price was rite,Delivery was speedy pages are really yellow but I wasn't at bookstore and I knew it was used good condition on a used product
3,Thanks,"I have not too much to say,Nice book,clear,Very Instructive,good product,very easy to buy and read on line.I'll be back again."
4,Codependent No More - Excelllent,The book arrived quickly and was in the great shape it was stated to be when I purchased it. The book's message is as relevant now as it was when I read my first copy in the early 80s.
5,It is a very helpful book,"It is a very helpful book to improve self-esteem, and it helps to overcome anxiety and depression with counselor's help."
5,Great book,"Melody Beattie is probably the premier authority on codependency. As a counselor, I would definately recommend this book. But don't waste your money on the workbook. Go to Alanon or CODA instead."
4,Well written,This is a book that will help a lot. A few parts here and there does not pertain to my self but I think that will happen to anyone.
5,Wonderful book and extremely helpful,Very helpful and insightful....easy to read and makes you not want to put it down. You feel better after just the first chapter
4,Self help,This book was a good self help to help poeple realized t hey are not alone. This book helpme change my life around.
5,Wonderful Book,I wish I had this book 45 years ago when there were some probems with dependency in my familyThe book was full of great examples of codependency!
4,My wife needed it.,anything that would improve ours skills to deal with our kids is always worth buying. great price too and very easy reading.
3,Discriptive and depressing,"In the beginning, I was really excited to read this book. I purchased copies for both my Nook for PC and Kindle Fire. The first 5 chapters gives the reader the impression that this book was written specifically for the reader. I fell for it. The breakdown of different co-dependent areas is believeable. As I got further into the book, I was turned off by reading about living with alcoholics and the detailed descriptions. This is repeated in more chapters. I deleted the Kindle copy altogether. The Nook copy is in archive until I decide what to do with it. If I had a paperback book, it would have been tossed in the trash. This is not a 'forward moving' book for me."
4,To Thine Own Self Be True,"This book has been a useful tool in my life. Living with an alcoholic and knowing many, it has given me many helpful suggestions. I learned that I am only responsible for myself and I cannot change anyone else. I had to learn to feel good about myself and not look to another to do that for me. I thought I was a victim but then learned that there are no happy victims and I want and deserve to be happy.I now have many healthy relationships and have a lot of fun in my life. Along with Melody Beattie's books, I have found other authors that I absolutely love because they too are about living in the moment and having a magical life. The two books are ""Working on Yourself Doesn't Work"" and ""How to Create a Magical Relationship"" by Ariel and Shya Kane.Go for your life, fill yourself up with what feels good to you and be true to yourself, if I can do it, so can you."
3,"helpful, but not culturally competent",This book was helpful. It's based on the same premise as AA model. It comes from a totally western tradition and doesn't include space for people of color or queer folks.
4,Savior Respite,"This book is a godsend for those who find themselves always in the midst of saving others at the expense of their own well being. Codependence is not a bad word, or a label of shame...the book uses it as a term of enlightenment leading to empowerment.Although not confined to certain life situations, the book is geared for those who have endured the compulsive, destructive behaviors of alcoholics, severely ill, mentally unstable, etc. Time endured with the chaos, confusion and compulsive behaviors of our loved ones may generate a codependent personality. The codependent coping mechanisms are simply not healthy for one's own growth.Codependence can give you superb intuitive powers, amazing organizational skills, unflagging energy and extraordinary juggling skills---however there is one focal point of the book. A codependent is always busy taking care of everyone but themselves...this book is bold and tactful in its delivery...engaging, helpful, and above all...hopeful!"
2,Codependent no more,Loads of descriptions of the various problems of co-dependency but few if any suggestions as to how to cope or what to do about it.
4,Helpful & Uplifting,I had heard other people say that they had found themselves in this book. I now know what they meant. Very helpful book. I am sure it has changed thousands of lives.
3,Get the workbook too,"To read this book and get help out of it, you will need to get the wookbook. Many parts of the book seem to follow no normal pattern. It allows you to skip what does not applie to you. But how can person that is codependent know what to do???>?"
4,Clear and Understandable,"This book makes sense to me, it is written in an style that you dont have to be a Rhodes Scholar to understand. Im almost through my first read of it, and I'm going back with a highlighter next time and some post-its for places I want to discuss with others."
3,Controlling What Can Be Controlled - Oneself,"This is a book for everyone because codependency is everywhere. Melody Beattie explains how it happens that we let problems get us down when by thinking rationally it is possible to break free, although sometimes with great difficulty. This is about seeing things clearly, taking responsibility for oneself and taking action to improve our lives. I don't see this book as magic, like it would suddenly make somebody happy. But it can be part of what sets an individual on the happier and healthier path. If there is one thing of which I'm certain after reading this book, it's that we're not responsible for other people's addictions."
2,Codependent No More,"The book had many underlinings, margin notes and markings on the first 50+ pages including ink markings on the self evaluation sections. I would have wanted to know about this before purchasing the book. Otherwise, the purchased went smoothly and arrived quickly.I have purchased many used books and will always pay more for a book that is ""clean"" on the inside even though it may show wear on the outside. I would like to see this info become required by the seller on ALL used books listings."
1,Lacks Substance.,"Firstly, people should be aware that this book is really only intended for those that are in serious need of help. Mainly women whose partners are alcoholics, abusive etc..Secondly, there is a lot of reference to god, being a saviour only if you trust in him...blah blah.Lastly and most importantly, there is way too much waffle and not enough practical advice. Most paragraphs open with ""ohh we are sad sorry folk who have little self esteem.. "", over exaggerated to prove a point, but nevertheless that type of writing is hardly worthwhile considering the reader wants change/help.-FYI, I'm a 24 yo male who doesnt believe in man made religion."
3,An approach to being better,I'm only halfway through it so far so I'm not completely sure. However it seems to have some good information on what we codependants do to ourselves and activities at the end of each chapter to make it easy to understand.
5,Very helpful,This book was recommended to me by my counselor as I was going through a very unsure time in my life. It was so helpful to read stories of others in similar trials. The book is an easy read with helpful and practical ways to work through your own issues. Great help.
4,Good book,Worked well for me when I was in a codependent recovery group. Would recommend it for other people going through the recovery of codependency.
5,A good guide.,This is a must have on the shelf of people struggling with the addiction issues and mental illnesses of loved ones.
2,Everyone is codependent?,"If you follow the authors logic everyone is codependent. I did find some pearls of wisdom that I thought applied to me but they were few and far between. The author acknowledges that she used other sources to come up with her theories and I felt it was these other sources were probably the source of her more meaningful insights. She also seems to confuse enabling behaviors with codependency and in my perspective, they are two different things."
5,Codependents Start Here,"This is the first book that I read about codependency. I saw myself on every page. Reading this book was the first step taken on a solid path of recovery. This path includes reading this book, doing the exercises, attending CoDA meetings and working weekly with a sponsor, going through the twelve steps. Ms. Beattie gives one of the best definitions of codependency I have seen and takes her time doing so. It is a complicated disease, with many strains and deviations. She captures it all very well. I could relate to the stories shared within and found the exercises to be very helpful to my recovery. If one thinks they might be codependent and/or is struggling with an addict in their life, this book will provide comfort, valuable information and hope.Juliet A. Wright, author of ""Everything is My Fault.""Everything Is My Fault"
5,Excellent Book,"A great resource for any individual who has found themselves in a dysfunctional relationship. I was able to see myself, see my mistakes and unhealthy responses, which enabled me to work toward changing in a positive, productive and healthy way."
5,A Guide To Help Identify and Change Unpleasant Emotions,"I finished reading this book and turned back to the front and started reading it again. How could anyone describe me so perfectly and give me the help and guidance I need when they don't even no who I am.The best self help book I have ever picked up especially after living with an alcoholic for 32 years.It will be a crutial part of making a new, healhty woman out of me.Thank you for this book!"
4,Kindly enlightening,"This book helped me to see the side of myself that gets hooked into situations that are unhealthy for me, and my reactions to it. I felt like Melody is a friend who tells you the truth without her ego getting in the way. This is one of the books I go to to when I'm checking out that I am on the right path and that I'm not crazy. Her writing is simple and to the point without alot of fancy language that makes an already insecure person feel better able to grab the message. Face it, if you are reading this book, your mind and emotions are probably in turmoil, and kindness is the key to recovery from what's eating you. This is one of my books I no longer loan out, because people don't return them!"
3,Codependent No More,This book was pretty helpful in some ways. It is easy to read and it is not just for people who are in relationships with substance abusers. I think there is a lot of material in this book that could be of help to people who don't see codependency as a problem in their life.
5,good book a little longer to get,"Okay, yes, sobriety was the beginning. Until I could stop using drugs and alcohol, I was unable to really change me. The journey of sobriety was the beginning. Through sponsors and therapists, of course in my own time (I'm stubborn.)I was ready to look at How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring For Myself. The relationship I had with myself was the first one I needed to look at. Realizing my behavioral addictions - was one of the most baffling areas of life - I am the only one who can help myself, by hearing myself and following the advise of others. This book helps. It's the effort I put into my own recovery - by reading, working and following the activities in this book. Life does not have to be the terrifying world it was. Life is a process. I am so glad Melody Beattie wrote this book. It is a keeper! Keep living and learning!"
2,"Good read, but could be better","This book isn't a bad read, but the writer focuses heavily on alcoholism and those affected by it, and there's a strong focus on religion ( god ) which started to get on my nerves.I think everyone would take something good from this book, but it's definitely not the be-all-and-end-all of codependency,"
3,Good for people that are not codependent,This book provided a much needed understanding for me on how real codependency is for people around me. It has allowed me to be more patient with loved ones or at least understand where all the projected frustration and anxiety comes from over things that appear to be so unimportant to me. I also regonized that it can be very easy to fall into codependent ways and give up on believing in yourself.
4,Great!,"This single CD is really good. It uses the not-so-common ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" with the spoken intro which was only used on early editions of Bad and the 1987 single. ""Don't Be Messin' 'Round"", one of the bonus tracks on BAD25, is a fun, catchy tune. A great CD to add to your collection!"
5,"Standard CO2 Cartridge, does what it's supposed to.","I bought this extra pack of CO2 cartridges for my Kleer Drain product in case the first few shots didn't do the job for my clogged sink and bathtub... It is really hard to go wrong with a CO2 cartridge so I gave it a 5 star review since it did what I expected.The only other experience I have with CO2 Cartridges is in my Pump Phantom Paintball gun but that is a different scenario where one cartridge lasts for many many rounds opposed to using all the air in one fell shot.Conclusion: Lives up to purpose, got my drain cleared in 2 shots.. and it was in TERRIBLE shape.Namaste,Dey"
2,necklace too short,"The necklace broke the first time my husband took it off. It's entirely too short. I am doubly disappointed because when it arrived the first time, the ""diabetic"" inscription was missing; I returned it, and the item, as it was advertised, did make it back before Christmas."
2,stamped not clear,the id necklace chain has no clasp and it barely fit over my head if someone had a bigger head it would not fit at all also the diabetes stamp u cannot make it out
2,Cheap & Nearly Unreadable,"This bracelet, although relatively inexpensive, is too cheaply made. The links from bracelet to chain are cheap and can be pulled off. The emblem comes off (as mine did) as it is just glued on. The word DIABETIC lightly engraved on the back is barely readable and in less than good lighting conditions may not be able to be read at all. Not recommended at any price."
3,"Nice item, but too small","Nice quality item, particularly for the price. Only problem is there is no clasp and my husband couldn't get it over his head. So measure to see if it will work for you."
5,great size,"took it off the chain and put it on a charm bracelet - my cousin loved it -- older lady and she was self conscious about telling the world about her ""personal business"" looks like a nice piece of jewelry - good shine and size."
4,Newly placed on insulin,"This was a great price for the tag. The chain was a bit on the chintzy side, so I ended up using an older chain that I had on hand."
1,The silliness of the premise,"Cahill has written some excellent books, but this is emphatically not one of them. Jesus is quite simply the most transcendently important figure in the history of theology. Moslems, Christians of all variety, Bahai, Torah Observant Messianic Jews all consider the religious inspiration of Jesus manifest. At least as significant, great moral leaders and thinkers from Spinoza (who considered Jesus the greatest of all Jewish prophets) to Schweitzer (who began the study for the historical Jesus) did not doubt for a moment the unique spiritual importance of Jesus.One other online reviewer noted the famouns C.S. Lewis analysis that Jesues was either insane, evil, or divine. It is not necessary to go that far (Moslems and several Messianic Jewish groups simply consider Jesus a great prophet). But a ""nice guy"" whose teachings endured and grew through more intense persecution during its first several centuries than any in world history is not just a ""nice guy."""
1,very poor scholarship,"Not well researched. Assumes that there actually was a historical Jesus, something which is not at all certain. Looks at Christianity as a Jewish movement and ignores the earlier Gnostic texts which clearly show that christianity was a Greek mystery religion with elements of bhuddism thrown in. Terrible."
2,Politically Correct Jesus for the Oprah Crowd,"Those interested in biblical history will find nothing new here. If you want an inspirational historical account on this subject, read John Romer's ""Testament"" which was also a PBS series. Mr. Cahill seems to have enough points about the Christian/Judaism relationship and the early church to fill a magazine article. His conclusions are almost shocking in their reliance on predictable politically correct catch phrases that swiftly deteriorate into his personal opinions. The book is crushed under a huge modern bias. All the cool sins (adultery) will be forgiven while others (making money) will not be. To borrow a catch phrase,this book is one calorie ""Christian-lite"". Although only 320 pages, many pages are nothing but passages printed from the bible that make the book appear longer than it really is. Mr. Cahill will make millions on this book, and we will certainly be seeing him on the Oprah show."
2,"Very good at times, but overall disappointing","After his enthralling and splendid first book in this series, How the Irish Saved Civilization, I could not wait for more. However, in the second book, The Gift of the Jews, Cahill had a fantastically rich and important story to tell, but his writing did not match up to his first effort. I really am sorry to say that the decline inthe quality of the second book continues here. Again, Cahill's topic is of unsurpassing importance but his writing does not meet expectations. I still think he is a very talented writer, but I think in these last two books he is having trouble in deciding exactly what he wants to say"
2,2nd best,"Cahill is a fine writer but I thought Philip Yancey's ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" actually achieved what Cahill attempted and failed at here."
4,Entertaining and fascinating,This book was an excellent read that I could hardly put down. I have little to add to the comments on the scholarly nature of this book other than that I would have appreciated an extensive bibliography.
2,Desire of the Everlasting Hills: The World Before and After Jesus,This book is not up to the quality of How the Irish Saved Civilization. Too much of his writing is merely quoting sources. Actually it is rather boring.
2,The book doesn't measure up to the title,"I am glad I didn't buy the book - I borrowed it. Cahill is in over his head. For example, he states that Jesus taught us to be kind and love one another and for this he lost his life. Earth to Cahill - Jesus lost his life because he said he was the ""one who was to come"" in response to the High Priest's question regarding his identity. By this he meant that he was the Messiah. Had he said ""no"" he would have walked out a free man. This is just one misrepresentation. Another is his discussion on ""looking at women lustfully"" - Cahill totally misses the point. Jesus' immense influence on history is an excellent topic and if you are interested buy Kennedy's ""What if Jesus had never been born"". Don't waste your money on this book.R. C. Lewis"
1,How do you sleep at night Mr. Cahill?,"If you ever wondered what a vulgur human being like Andrew Dice Clay would sound like if he wrote a Christian book, pick up a copy of this book. Normally, when I describe the life of Jesus, I avoid use of the F-word, but I guess this is Mr. Cahill's preference. But even more importantly, Cahill takes the time to talk about the Savior genitals. I apologize for the blunt nature of my review, but if Amazon can sell a book that mentions it, I should be able to talk about it in my review. Never has a book left me with such a violated and angry feeling as this book. I could not even finish the book, which is rare for me. So Mr. Cahill, how do intent to explain yourself on judgement day?"
4,"Engaging and Informative, But Ultimately Disappointing","Cahill is always a good read, and there is some new information and thinking here, but for Christ's sake this series is called ""Hinges of History"" and the subtitle to the book is ""The World Before and After Jesus."" There is little if anything here about either of these issues -- C'mon Cahill, is the world different after Jesus? How? Why? Those are huge questions, sure, but it is a little disappointing that Cahill never manages even to brush up against them in the entire book. Still, a good read if only because of Cahill's engaging style.On last issue. I am a Christian, and I have no idea why any Christian would not like this book or should be afraid of it, as some of the other commentators seem to be."
3,"an entertaining, but sometimes frustrating, rehash","Like his previous books, the author offers an entertaining, but sometimes frustrating, glimpse of ancient history. He gives a nice recap of the period preceding Jesus and the impact he had on human thought. But the author does not really offer any new insights - a difficult task since the subject is one of the most analyzed in history.The big problem I have with the book is in the writing. Using two adjectives before each subject becomes tiring, and insulting, to the reader. Nor does Cahill's casualness (""Earth to Jesus: Hello!"") jibe with his subject matter."
4,Engaging and readable,"This book effortlessly paints the historical context in which Jesus and his early followers lived. It's very broad in scope, with an emphasis on trends and big ideas rather than painstaking detail (which I think makes it more readable--I wasn't looking to curl up with a dry ""The Bible As History"" textbook). Cahill does make a few convenient assumptions (e.g. Paul wasn't sexist, ""Wives, submit to your husbands"" was simply him playing to the attitudes of the times ?!?) and I suspect knowledgeable readers might find a few bones to pick with him. But he writes beautifully, with obvious passion for his topic. His respect for both the Jewish and Christian traditions is evident and, for me (I am Christian), broadens the appeal of this book. (Gifts of the Jews was great too)."
3,Roman Arch,"A nice set, though a bit complicated. The pieces are rather small and numerous. Be sure to hold on to the directions."
4,Great Kit,"This is a pretty good kit for demonstrating how the Roman arch works. There were more pieces than we had realized, once it was in front of us. The arch does go together well, and the instructions are well done and easy to follow. The blocks are a little lighter weight than we thought they would be, so they do move around easier than the heavy wooden blocks we have, but since most people won't be doing this kit with a three year-old, it isn't a huge deal. The Roman's were amazing engineers for their time, and this kit is one way to bring a little Roman study to life."
4,"Handy, Dandy Controller Corral","This is a nice little unit that doesn't take up much space. It holds six of my remote controls, all of which are regular-sized or, in the case of my LG TV remote, large or my Onkyo remote, fat. I like also the fact that I can insert my own personal pictures on the sides, although the ones the unit comes with are pleasant enough if you don't want to bother.The unit is sturdy, but here is where you want to be careful. If you put the unit on its spinner bottom, any imbalance in your controller weights will tip it over. The base unit needs to be wider. I use it without the ability to spin. The unit is small enough so that all controllers are within easy reach, so if you use it this way, be sure to turn the picture you like best facing you.This product fulfilled my expectations (except for the tipping over as described above.) All in all, a good buy. Works well for me."
5,perfect storage for multiple remotes,"I LOVE this little gem! It does just what it's supposed to do without taking up too much space. I have 4 remotes, a note pad, my reading glasses, and a pen in less space that one remote used to take. No more hunting for the darn things and they have not dropped on the floor in weeks."
4,Does what is supposed to do,"Holds 4-5 remote controls like it is supposed to do. It keeps them organized. I don't know why amazon wants me to write 20 words on this? It is a simple item that does not require much description, give me a break!"
1,Horrible piece of junk,"Quality of the plastic is so low very flimsy. Moreover, the bottom spinner does not sit tight making it useless.Returning the item is painful as it is not sold by Amazon. So stat away from this crap."
2,A bit disappointed,"If the middle box would stay in place, this would be a great product. It's annoying that it moves around. It's still functional though."
4,Remote Caddy,I'm very satisfied with the remote caddy from Amazon. I had been looking in stores for a long time for one and was pleased to find what I was looking for at Amazon.com
1,Very Disappointed,This product arrived broken in two places. Not the fault of the shipper. Manufactured with cheap plastic. Would NOT recommend buying it.
5,The cheapest ever offer for a PS2 with all this.,"This bundle's price is amazing. The console itslef is usually that much, so you get the best game out there for free, the steering wheel for free, the DVD remote, Memory card and more. I would have loved to buy this, but i already have the system. Highly recommended!"
1,Missing Items,"As one other victim also writes, I too was missing the DVD Controller and Steering wheel. Christmas morning was just not the same since we did not get what was ordered... Santa should take issue with this poor quality control. I think Amazon should give all it's shafted customers a free game CD to make up for the Holiday shortcomings... what do you say Jeff ?"
1,When is this thing going to arrive!!!,"I have a problem with this. It hasn't been in stock since it hit the net. I've looked around, and this game pack is definetly the best deal around, but IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO GET BACK IN STOCK. The entire pack probably has a net value of around $500, and at only $399 it's a great value. But does anyone know what is keeping this entire package backordered? THE REMOTE. Because of the Interact DVD remote, people haven't been able to buy this great PS2 deal. I'm very irritated, and annoyed because this deal is so good that I am committed to waiting around for it. But because of that remote, no one can purchase this. It's not even supposed to be that good of a remote!! If I were you just go and wait for the Gamecube, which will arrive in November and waste both the PS2 and the X-Box. Amazon! What are you doing!!"
4,not bad but a bit lazy,"you can find a ps2 for the normal price now and the combo pack goes for 329-339 many places. mostly you will play gran tourismo with the regular controller instead of the wheel because it is easier and the game is hard enough. Still the system is fun and this is a great game. I just think you would be better of avoiding this wheel, picking up a ps2 without it and then buying the interact wheel that was made especially for this game. one hint for you: Mitsubishi Lancer V1. dont say I never give you nothin'. peace."
1,missing items,"A one star rating is to much. I did not receive the V3FX steering, nor did I get the DVD remote that I was suppose to get in the package. This was not only a Christmas gift to my husband but also an Aniversary gift. Your options for addressing this problem are limited and I still do not have a clue when I can get this problem resolved and of course Christmas Eve is just 3 days."
2,"While the game is good, I have to mark down the system","The 2 stars does not go for GT3, a four star game. The system deserves only 2 stars. I was very disappointed with the system for a few reasons. One reason was the DVD player. If you are buying this system to play dvds, you may want to reconsider.The Ps2 dvd player misses many options- it is devoid of the ability to always switch the screen ratio of a movie.Another reason I was disappointed with the system is the price. For the price, I expected a system with much better graphics- the graphics are not spectacular- only a very small step up from dreamcast(and even dc beats ps2 in some areas). Plus all extra controllers and peripherials are very priceyThe last reason is the speed, the ps2 seems really slow to load.Other than that the games are pretty good, I recommend GT3, Twisted Metal, Red Faction"
2,Excellent pocket Knife Poor stainless steel,"Very comfy grip, very sharp blade. Easy to open and easy to close, with one hand. Fits in my pocket and its a rather large blade. All that's left is to see if the Knife stands the test of time. But right now this blade doesnt appear to be standing the test of time. I'm getting signs of rust already and i've had it for around a week. THe blade is discoloring and has a bunch of brown spots. I've barely used this knife to cut simple things like plastic or in one instance to scud some deer hide. I've kept the blade clean and dry. Last wordDissapointed"
5,Nice update of the original,"I had the original when I was in the Army and loved it. Good compromise between a full sized belt knife and a multi-tool or pocket knife. Handle is outstanding, wonderful grip and very sturdy. The sheath is crap though. I like the original soft case better. The one that comes with it is some kind of semi-hard case that doesn't look like it was designed for this knife, more like a generic kind of thing. Fortunately it fits my Gerber multi-tool case quite nicely as my tool has its own pouch I put it in."
3,Rich and well produced pop,"Listen to these guys. It is specially good their cover of ""I Still Haven't Found what I'm looking for"". If you like Paul Carrack, Billy Joel or The Corrs you will love them"
1,what the h,I dont know what i was thinking buying this. its great music if youve never heard any before. Dont listen in the car as it may cause an accident.
4,Recommended reading,"Modern education tends to overlook essential subjects that are needed in today's world, especially when confronted with day-to-day decisions that are influenced by the mainstream media - not the best influence around. Well-grounded thinking is required to combat what has been called ""The Dictatorship of Relativism"" by Pope Benedict XVI. A good basis in philosophical thinking is a must. Maritain browses over the history of philosophy in his work - a good start for further investigation on philosophical thinking."
4,Solid philosophy introduction,"Although concentrated on Western philosophy, this book will bring a good basic understanding of philosophy as a whole"
4,Fun and sexy...a great CD,"I randomly picked up this CD and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. With Christian McBride on bass and Belasco's sexy voice, this album is a must. Very fun with a touch of darkness. ""Get It Together"" is a great addition to anyone's collection, whether you're a jazz lover or not. The one downside is that a few of the songs sound a little alike."
5,Great CD - Glad I Finally Purchased It,"Based on the strength of the song ""All in My Mind"" I'd been waiting for this CD to be available in download. After a year with no download yet available, I finally gave up and purchased the CD. I was not disappointed. Get It Together is a fun, funky collection of lounge and soul tunes from a very talented singer, songwriter, musician and arranger. On tunes like ""All in My Mind"" and ""Love Train"" (not the O'Jays classic) Mr. Belasco has the Curtis Mayfield vibe down perfectly. Other songs are more straight forward pop, but just as enjoyable. My only disappointment is that there are a few instrumentals included. They are good songs, but Mr. Belasco has such an interesting voice I want to here him singe on every song. This CD is highly recommended and I hope it does become available on download someday as I have to believe it would help give him more exposure which he richly deserves."
4,Smooth listening,"I really enjoy the CD. The tracks are nice my favorite is love train. This song opens the door for a nice romantic setting. By no means boring. Nice investment for those who can appreciate an upbeat jazzy sound with a splash from the 70""s"
5,Just Cool!!!,"This album is so much fun to listen to. I heard his second album first and you all know how sexy and sensually charged that one was. So, I was expecting that with this album. When I didn't get that with this album, I was really disappointed with it, so I put it away for a long while. Then, for some reason I pulled it out and gave it a listen. Man, I was wowed by this album. This album is sexy, fun, silly, just wonderful. Man, I'm glad that I bought this one. Too bad this album got overlooked by the masses cuz this is really a good record and has many treats all the way through. But, oh well..."
2,JVC DVL520,"I bought the JVC DVL520 and I took it back next day. My main complaint was in low light conditions, there were vertical lines appearing on the screen. It wasn't overly obvious but very distracting nontheless. I tried to correct it by manually adjusting each individual settings but nothing worked. The picture quality was not too bad in bright conditions, but in darker conditions i was not prepared to just accept it. After all I spent AUD$1450 on a camera and I'd better get what I pay for. It was a shame because the size and shape of the 520 was really good plus some nice features too. Anyway I took it back to the shop and bought the Sony TRV18 instead. Sure it was a more expensive camera but truly worth it. Pictue quality was almost DVD-like but no vertical lines at all -even in dark conditions (perhaps a little grainy). I wouldn't recommend the 520 unless you will be taking videos outdoors exclusively."
4,"Low Light recording OK, Beats Canon ZR45MC","I bought this camcorder AFTER I had my Canon ZR45MC. If you read some other reviews complaining the low light recording functions of this camcorder, let me tell you it is not that bad. I tried both video and still photo in my dining room with only 4x15 watts lights. The result was very pleasant. Comparing to the Canon ZR45MC I had, it was much better. The Canon produces very grainly images with many color dots all over the pictures (video noise), while this JVC did very well. I am replacing the Canon with this JVC for exactly this reason - low light performance. I cannot give it a 5-star because its black and white view finder, 10x optical zooming and no AD converter. On the other hand, Canon ZR45MC has 18x optical zooming, color view finder and AD converter, but for more money."
3,Great Low Cost Entry to Mini DV recording,"I am a TV producer, but I can't always run aound with a XLS-1 with me. This is far the least expensive DV cam I've found, nice basic features, leans a little on the blued and the autofocus is quite slow in lower loght situations. Still, if you want a nice 520 line rez DV cam with nice zoom features and firewire and USB connect capabilites, this can't be beat. However, the prices I've seen here are a bit high, I grabbed mine at BJ's discount for $298 - and I've seen it listed here for up to 40% more. So shop around, it's a basic DV cam that's been discontinued. I love it for the money, but I wouldn't spend $400 or $500 on it. There are plenty of better cams in those price ranges. But if you can get this for anywhere near $300 - grab it. Wou won't be disappointed. I used to pay thousands of dollars more for SP Betacams with less lines of resolution, analog technology and the need to convert analog to digital for editing. Try this baby first."
1,Digital board failure,"Do not buy this camera if you are looking for a quality long lasting product. These models have frequent digital board failures. I had mine for just 2 years, the estimate is $ 400 to fix it. For that price I bought a Panasonic pvgs120. Much better quality, especially in low light settings.In addition, these models (and other JVC models) have frequent E04 errors, keep an eye on consumer reports."
1,...,"We bought it brand-new. It worked for a while, but after about 30 minutes of use, the eyepiece (optical viewfinder) quit working, literally becoming almost blank, with picture nearly impossible to see.Also it recorded fine only in bright, high-contrast sunlight with a lot of shades. Even in bright, but hazy daylight the picture produced was low-contrast and a bit too dark, which was quite unpleasant.In the past, I always associated the words ""Made in Japan"" with impeccably high quality, especially in electronics. I can see things have changed even in that country. Nowadays ""Made in Japan"" could mean as shoddy job, as made in Communist China or elsewhere.Another minor complaint: the memory card's compartment door tends to open by its own, due to poorly made latch."
5,Great CD !!,"This is a really Great CD...But then again I might be a little Partial to it since I wrote Cut number 11 ""DAD"" :)I hope it continues to stay out there in the Market. Wayne Lewis really did a Great Job Singing this. I'm proudto have a song on a CD from a Classic group such as this one. Always, is still one of my favorite's. I wish that Icould get in touch with the Group. Keep up the great work !! Jesse Haney..."
4,It's Payed For It Self,"This product has payed for it self already, not only in helping me to grade my own coins but in teaching me the different ways coins are graded with illistrations. I really learned alot."
5,A must have reference.,This is not the most recent copy of this book but it's still worth having. The newer version makes extensive use of photos but this book has great descriptions that are lacking in most of the newer grading books. The descriptions in this book have often helped me in grading coins that could be either one grade or another.
1,PATHETIC!!!!,"This game is a pathetic waste of money. It doesn't at all use the full power of the GBA at all........Personally, I got my game boy only yesterday, but I already have or have played 14 games......and this one was the worst.......Save your money on the release of Grand Theft Auto....."
3,Army Men Advance,"This game is wasting your time and money! It might seem cool, but is very repetitive. It lacks true a gaming expreience, such as graphics and a good story line, and the pace is also slow.I gave it a 3 because it's simple and somewhat fun. If you like Army Men, go buy a N64 and those Army Men games, or waste your time."
2,Sleeping is more fun.,At first glance the game looks as though its fun and will give you hours of fun. Think again before buying this game. there is no in-game saving which means you have to use a password to get to the level you were last on. Save your money and buy castlevania .to sum this game into two words: IT [ISN'T VERY GOOD]!
2,"Good back in '01....now, skip it!","This game was good back when Gameboy was new but now that there are plenty more and better games......this game sucksIgnore this nonsense...please(this game sucksthis game sucksthis game sucksthis game sucksthis game sucksthis game sucks the levels are boring and sometimes hard and well get another game or the boogeyman will kick your @$$ duh!!!! hahahahahah blaH blaHblaHblaHblaHblaHblaH hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha)now...seriouly... don't get this game, buy metroid fusion or metroid zero mission. Or if you are really into army men (You dorks) you can buy toy soldiers to play with duh!"
3,3 and a half actually...,"This game is pretty cool. It's not very hard and it's pretty repetitive, but it's also very fun. Younger kids will have a blast with it, but older gamers such as myself will soon look for other avenues of challenge. Buy Castlevania, Mario, Tony Hawk, and Rayman first, then think about this one."
1,Army Men Advance,this game was so bad. it was the gameplay and the graphics. i strongly suggess that you don't buy it. take my word i am a gamer.
5,This album is amazing.,"Never have I heard such original versions of Hancock's music. This album is all worth the insane version of Chameleon. Also, being a drummer myself, I'd heavily recomend this album for a ""music-drums"" tape. It allows a lot of space for a drumer to fit in, and you can't NOT have fun with the song ""Sly"" after, god willing, you figure it out. (9/8, 7/16, 3/4.)"
4,Martin Luther Hitler's Spiritual Ancestor,"This book was originally written in 1942 by an English University professor who emigrated from Germany as a child. There are some generalizations in the book accepted as fact due to this experience. This is a very eye-opening book, as I explained to another fellow, what Luther said Hitler did, (and, as the book points out, Hitler was a Catholic.) But I was reading a book on Paul and the author kept repeating the point that the Lutheran Paul had lost credibility in light of recent historical events. I put Luther and Jews in Google, and found this book and the book Luther wrote, The jews and their Lies."
2,The Rough Guide Phrasebook is much better.,I used the Lonely Planet Guide until I found the Rough Guide Phrasebook. I found myself using more Chinese once I started using the Rough Guide because I could find the words I needed more quickly. The Chinese-English section is brief but invaluable.
3,Not the color I thought.......,"When I saw these shoes I thought they were cute.... I got the pink pair. They are cute ... BUT I havent seen these before and it looks to me like in the image that the shoes are white and pink with a pink sort of design on them. But, the ""design"" is actually like cracks and like a greenish/silver color to it, not pink. They are cute still, but I would not have gotten these if I wouldve known what they really look like. I dont know how else to explain it. I hope it was helpful"
1,Spend you money better,It does not tell me about any real cases. Limited value beyond plain internet discussions. It appears to me that this book was put together in a real hurry. Good ideas that were never developed.
5,"Excellent ""Practical"" Guide on Managing Knowledge....","This book offers a no-nonsense practical approach to managing knowledge in todays WWW based platform. KM is on everyone's radar screens as of late and this book cuts to the chase giving excellent real world examples and solutions including an implementable 90 day action plan! Excellent resource...Marcus P. Zillman, M.S., A.M.H.A. CEO BotTechnology.com, Inc."
5,Nice surprise,"This little guy packs a relatively quiet and effective punch. This is mine, my wife has her own and it serves its purpose well since its strong yet thin enough not to cause discomfort. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys some behind play without being overbearing."
1,"Great movie, but","I second the reviews below. This is a 5-star movie, but the quality of this transfer is horrible. Parts of the movie are very scratchy and full of film debris. Worst yet, to me, are the subtitles. They are laughable. Almost every subtitle contained some error. While it was (sorta) fun to laugh and the odd subtitles, that tended to remove me emotionally from the film. Too bad. The same comments apply to the ""Raise the Red Lantern"" release from this same company."
1,STOP!!!! TOTAL RIPOFF,"I just got my copy of this dvd which i was awaiting for anxiously having read the terrible reviews it has gotten last night and too late to cancel I cannot believe the bad quality of this dvd - the image is deplorable - it jumps, it has black scratches as if rain were falling, the colors are completely washed out and the sound is the worst I have ever heard or purchased. Be forwarned. I cannot believe the Zhang Yimou would let this product be sold with his name on it - the manufacturer should be ashamed for selling this and Amazon should give people back their money who bought this and accept the fact that is is not worth two cents."
2,"A Grest Movie, but a terrible DVD Version","I am totally diappointed with this DVD re-production. The video and sund are the worst I have ever seen and listened. It seems that I am watching a movie from late 30s. I bought it, because it was reproduced by Pionner, the leading home electronic giant. However, they totoally screw up on this maganificent movie. There is not a single special feature on DVD, no trailer, no production notes, no nothing. Simply a scene selection, that is it. A totally diaster."
3,Dark,"This movie is dark, so dark it is unbelievable. It seems everything and everyone, including the family, townspeople, even the son, would rather see the couple dead than happy. And not just happy together - even to have some peace or solace is absolutely unacceptable. The acting is superb, but the story overdoes it with the purely evil antagonists, the overwhelming unhappiness, and overpowering destruction of all hope. Even China in the '20s allowed for some happiness and harmony in the world."
1,zhang yimou,"Rating - 5 stars for the film, of course, but zero stars for the copy.Thank you so much for the information on the new editions of Ju Dou, Qui Ju. (Razor). I have cancelled my order. I will keep reading your commments and continue my search for these films (Red Sorgum also). And will let you know if I find anything. Thanks to Amazon for letting us give and receive helpful opinions.Looking for excellent copies of RED LANTERNS (allright edition), TO LIVE (MGN), and SHANGHAI TRIAD (Shanghai film studio) ? You can get them in France at www. FNAC.com. They are about 20 Euros each which is about 17$. Of course you will have to pay postage, and perhaps customs, but they are worth it. From new copies and brilliant colors. Only TO LIVE has English sub titles. All three have French subtitles. You also will need a DVD player which can read zone2 disques.FOSSES-ST-B."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have over 300 dvds and this is by far the worst transfer to a disc I have ever seen. The colors are horrible as it bleeds all over the place. At times the film actually bounces and stutters like an old, crusty, 16mm tape that's coming apart. You know the kind, those old home movies from the 1950s. It's impossible to enjoy this fine movie (or any movie for that matter)when your senses are assaulted with this disaster of a transfer. Avoid it like the proverbial plague!!"
1,"Superb film, shockingly bad dvd","I first saw this film on British TV some years ago and was mesmerised - beautiful and compelling. Sadly, the only DVD release was the long out of print cropped US disc, which was not worth the hundreds of dollars it sold for on e-bay, or a reportedly dreadful import from China. When I heard it was getting a new release I was extremely excited, and pre-ordered it immediately. ""It can't be worse than the alternatives"", I thought. How wrong I was :( This DVD release (along with Raise The Red Lantern from the same company) is simply one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen - and I've seen some of the worst the format has to offer. How any company can justify releasing such a shoddy product is beyond me - it must take some effort to make the film look even worse than it does on VHS or the import from China. Amazon should refuse to sell it."
4,Superb Film--Rotten DVD,"As the Chinese government wants to supress Yimou's work for it's less than idyllic portrayal of China, they couldn't have a better partner in crime than MagicPlay Entertainment. This is just an awful DVD made from a worn out print by a bunch of slackers on a bad day. Another reviewer has said they have performed a similar hatchet job on ""Raise the Red Lantern.""I was lucky enough to see that on cable a few years ago and the photography was incredibly fine--even the credits were beautiful and the color saturation & resolution were amazing."
1,"Wonderful movie, lousy DVD","This DVD should be outlawed and purged from the Amazon inventory, it is a disgrace to what DVD is capable of. It is a lousy transfer from a lousy print. DO AVOID AT ALL COSTS AND AWAIT A MORE DESERVING DVD OF A GREAT FILM."
3,Disquieting Study Of Oppression,"A bleak and disquieting exploration of the spirit stripping effects of sustained oppression from which there is no escape. This is a film about the dessertification of soul. Even eros doesn't rescue the trapped characters of this complex and probing cinematc work. ( ditto on film quality, color and poor subtitles/trasnlations)"
2,Poor quality control,This appears to be a nice student microscope but arrived without at least three screws that hold the head onto the rest of the microscope. Not especially happy with this for 99 dollars.
1,No response,"This review isn't for the microscope but for the seller Shopzeus. I wanted to purchase this microscope for my son for Christmas so I placed an order and waited for a response. After two weeks the seller had not confirmed the order, nor had they replied to a follow up e-mail I sent about the purchase. I ended up having to go with a different microscope from another vendor with a steeper shipping charge since Christmas was so near. Thanks for nothing Shopzeus."
1,disappointed,"I had the same problem with ShopZeus as another reviewer. We were disappointed in the microscope. It is technically a fine microscope but after you look at the 5 sample slides, what then? There is nothing that can be used to make more slides, you'd have to buy that separately. I hit a dead end trying to return it. There needs to be a number provided by ShopZeus before you can return anything. I emailed asking for this number and never heard back. Amazon replied promptly to my help request and refunded the money but asked that I return the item to ShopZeus. I couldn't find an address for the company on their website, Amazon's website or the box. What a pain. Take a look at Eye-Clops. It was a great hit."
4,satisfied,"I did read most of the reviews and had some reservations about this microscope. The microscope arrived within the promised delivery date and all screws and parts where they were suppose to be. I'm very happy with the overall microscope, my son is nine years old and seems to enjoy it very much."
5,Gift for Grandson,Our 7-year old grandson loves this...the only problem he has is that his parents love it just as much so he has to share it with them! :-) It has proven to be a quality microscope and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking.
1,Cheap plastic break right away. Don't waste your money,"This is made of very cheap plastic, the magnified eye scope is a cheap piece of plastic, as I screwed it in, it couldn't hold and fell off the unit. It has very short attachment teeth about 3mm in length. Now how can that handle a child pressure. It came off and broke before I could use it."
2,Nothing earthshattering here,"I expected more from this, after reading about it in Mojo and elsewhere - but a groundbreaking psychedelic mind melter it most definitely is not. It is competently played but often derivative. The stand out tracks to me are Everything's Changing and Treulogy, the rest I found bland. Maybe I'm missing something that the other reviewers are picking up on - but I would not rate this essential psych. Buy the 13th Floor Elevators or Fever Tree instead."
4,Excellent,"Kak is straight forward rock from the late 1960s. It has a unmissable garage twinge.But the playing and the arrangements here are more fleshed out than on your average garage album. Both the guitars and bass are heavier, and the recording has a lot more bottom. Top quality sound. There are also some San Fransisco psych touches, but these songs are quite structured.Excellent"
4,Pure Puzzling Pleasure,"Always a fan of the late lamented Games Magazine, I sharpened my pencil and sat down for a long afternoon of mental enjoyment with Games Best Pencil Puzzles Volume 2. I was not disappointed. This book will keep me busy on and off for weeks. I especially like the Paint By Numbers section, which is a mental logic problem of multiple simultaneous equations that really captivated my mathematical mind. I also enjoyed the crossword puzzles. My only complaint is that some of the clues are somewhat dated; they refer to people and events that were current years ago. Now that I think about it, I guess I have another complaint; my husband keeps picking this book up and writing in it, in pen!For an excellent variety of puzzles, from easy to difficult, from crosswords to cryptics to logic to wacky wordies, this is a great choice. I recommend it to all, particularly those people who loved Games magazine, as did I."

I can't recommend this book highly enough. And, when the next edition is published, I'll buy it too. The Internet is a constantly changing entity, and WriterSpeaker.com helps me use my research time more efficiently."
5,Best help I've gotten in this area,"I bought the book on impulse, based on a very strong recommendation, and found it contains the best help I have ever discovered for a writer and/or speaker using the Internet. I highly recommend it. She has an unbelievable amount of detailed research at her fingertips."
4,Bounce,I believe these guys have come up with unique blend of rhythm and blues and hiphop. I bought thier CD when it first came out and I still listen to it to this day.
1,PRODUCT NOT AS DESCRIBED,"The product is NOT as described........no leather foot bed, size is fine, workmanship appears OK, unworn as of yet......... the seller or Amazon needs to change product description.....if what i received is what they are Really selling. Disappointed !"
1,Unreliable and Unprofessional,"Our order for basic Reef Men's Sandal was never fulfilled. We never received a status update, even after requesting one. This is NOT a reliable and professional seller/vendor."
5,The Best Flip Flops,"I had to buy a new pair b/c my dog ate mine. They hold up great otherwise, I've had a pair in red for 6 years and they are still great!"
3,"Comfortable, but.....","These are definitely cushy, but the arch support is not as good as advertised. It feels more like a little pebble under the arch of your foot than a full arch support. Also, they seem to be a little narrow for a regular width - I don't know if it is just that the straps are tighter than what I'm used to, or really are narrow. Bottom line, they are not as comfortable as my Crocs flip-flops."
3,"good, bad, and other",nice floppers well made but wouldnt fit my feet size ten real tight nice shoes so i gave to grandaughter
4,Reefs,"What can I say... they are reefs. I love them.Word to the wise though, they do a little small and narrow. Order up 1 size"
5,"Simple, Great and inexpensive",I have worn reef sandals for over 20 years. This inexpensive model is hard to locate at stores and is a good basic sandal that lasts and feels great. A plus is no gel so you can wear it on airplanes.
5,No other sandal gets my juices flowing,"Like these Reef Smoothy's. Like them, heck, I love them! This is my 2nd pair, many years since the first one, and the satisfaction is very high, as before. Not sure how they manage to make flip-flops feel so much better than any other. As for other reviewers, I ordered up in size (being a 10 or 10.5, I ordered the 11). The fit was just right. Hope they keep making these products, it's obvious that I'm not the only one that thinks they are special. Even Reef's many other models don't get the same level of positive ratings. Would have preferred a color other than black, but the positives of fit and comfort more than compensate for that."
3,Pretty good,"Nice and soft right out of the box. Strap is a bit tight. I wear about a size 12 shoe but was glad I ordered a size 13 sandal, I wouldn't want these any smaller. I wonder if a size 14 would be too big?I'm hoping these last forever. I seem to recall buying ""thongs"" as we called them at the market when I was a kid -- they cost a dollar and lasted until we outgrew them. Now I find myself spending twenty bucks on a pair.---Six months later: well, the strap finally loosened up a bit. In fact, it went from too tight to too loose in about a week. These are on the way out, I can't see how to tighten the strap, which had been too tight since I got them. For the money, I'm not real impressed. I was just going to recollect the old sandals we'd buy at the market when I was a kid but I see I'd already mentioned that in my initial review.Shoes like this that cost this much ought to last longer than six months, you know what I mean?"
5,Simple and Absolutely awesome!,"I first bought these when I was in the Marines and in Okinawa. I bought them on base from the exchange and at the time I was a newbie to regular flip flop wearing and was not familiar with the name ""REEF."" My options in the store were limited but I went with these actually cursing under my breath that I was about to pay $17 for essentially ""shower shoes!"" Fast forward at least 6-7 years and I've fallin in love with something as simple as some flip flops. Literally worn them all over the world, different countries and as many memories as I had in them, hated to finally toss them when worn down to nothing. Simple design, yet very comfortable and I liked how I could get them wet for whatever reason and they quickly dry while wearing. Excellent chance you'll love them too!"
5,great quality,"I love these flip flops. They hold up great and are so comfortable .. they offer more support than other flip flops, I can wear them for longs walks and not have any problems."
5,Comfortable,These sandals are great if you are looking for comfort. The strap is very sturdy and won't break...before the soles of the sandals get completely worn down from use at least.
1,"Cool look, bad quality","Within about a week, the leather began to delaminate from the sole. Now I have t deal with the amazon return policy. There are other similar reviews. Disappointing that reef des nt deal with this."
3,slippery sandal,"This is not a great sandal. The bottom is hard and is very slippery on my tile and wood floors. It is comfortable, but I would not recommend this for anyone not surefooted."
2,Very Poor Sizing and Quite Uncomfortable,"Ordered these about a half size larger than normal based on the reviews seen on this site. The size delivered was correct, but the sandals are extremely narrow, especially since where the bands connect to the base is far in from the side. Also, the bar between the toes was very uncomfortable - but this may be because the overall fit was so poor. Returned, will look elsewhere."
4,Nice slipper,"As expected, the Reef Smoothys are very nice, well constructed, but I must add to the recurring gripe; they really are very narrow. I wear 12EE and ordered 13 and they're still a bit narrower than I'd like and the toe grip is tight. Other than that, they're aesthetically pleasing and comfortable. A great deal for the price."
5,So comfortable,I bought these for my boyfriend b/c he already had a pair of these that he's had for at least 5 years and they're finally starting to wear out. He swears by these flip flops and won't wear any other brand. He loves the cloth strap and the thickness of the sole is perfect. And obviously they last a long time. Overall I'd say well worth the price!
1,It's excessive narrow....,"Really I disappear with this producto I bought a pair of sandals using my regular size of shoe but, this item is excesively narrow my feet dont enter in that"
5,Super comfy,"My man LOVES these flip-flops. I've been a Reef fan for years & he's just not really a flip-flop kind of guy, but motorcycle boots just don't work at the pool/beach/etc., so I bought these for him & he loves them."
4,Great sandal,"The sizes do run close to the actual size. I ordered an 11 and it fits...just. I know reef sandals do take the shape of your foot, so give it time."
4,"Good, but Not as Great as Smoothy","For a leather sandal, it is not bad. However, it is not the most comfortable thing in the world. Then again, what leather sandal is, I suppose? The leather is nice as it adds a bit more ""dress-up"" then a regular sandal. That said, I prefer comfort over ""dress-up"". If you must have leather, buy this sandal. If you want more comfort, try the Reef Smoothy. You won't be disappionted."
2,Great Poetry Poor Formatting,"Unfortunately there's no linked table of contents, which makes navigation really difficult. There's nothing wrong with the poetry but the lack of a TOC is really bad."
4,Power,"I can't call this one of my favorite concert DVDs, but it is one that holds up best under repeat plays. How come? The music is consistently, completely on. Great rock concerts have great energy, and this one keeps it up all the way through. Nirvana power pop. Its only 8 bucks used shipped!"
4,Foo DVD,"Well, I'm proud to say that I was a part of the Toronto show but sadly I couldn't find myself. Even being a big fan of them, I think for some reason they could've done better or maybe it was just me anticipating a really wicked dvd to buy. What should've been done is the audio concert of it should've been recorded on a normal cd so that ppl like me could listen on the discman and on the move. The ""hidden"" stuff in the dvd were hard to access on the pc, but I managed to get it done. Songs that should've been included are This is A Call, Walking after You and The One (Toronto performance). Otherwise, its alright overall."
1,Good Band - Horrible Audio Quality,I love the band but the audio quality was miserable. It sounded like it was recorded from the back of the hall with a hand held low-end camcorder. Maybe I got a defective copy?
3,So-So,"It is good.. but I wasn't impressed.... at times Dave's vocals are sub-par and the intensity of the music is lacking. I enjoyed watching it, but I was not impressed."
4,Kung Foo Fightin!!! YEEEEAHH!,"Awesome picture,with a couple different locations and styles( regular and acoustic). Even a music video! The only problem for me, and I can't say if it is the PSP or UMD, but the low volume is a disappointment.I bet it would be nice with some good external speakers. Anybody know of any?"
3,music - great ......singing - little flat,"This is a very good DVD, a well-rounded selection from the Foo's first four albums, and the fact that the disc starts right into the concert footage is great. The music is fantastic and, in particular, Taylor Hawkins on drums is just about perfect. The only real weakness is, well, Dave Grohl's voice. Let's just say his voice in studio and on the individual albums is great. Out of studio and on stage......ummmmmm, not so good. To listen to him try to belt out 'Aurora' at the Toronto show.....ugh. Painful stuff. You could almost believe they pulled some random dude out of the crowd and let him try to sing it. I love this band, I will always love this band and will buy whatever album they ever put out, but I think I'll pass on the live stuff."
4,Here's the REAL jist of the DVD....,"Good: Fact that it is the foo fighters, selection of songs (except they don't have much from their self titled debut), the toronto concert, the acoustic pieces in Washington DC Concert, the price, the DVD-ROM exclusive content (a lot better than the content made available on their ""One by One - ENHANCED features"" CD).Bad: At times the echo at the stadium is disguised by ""shifting"" in the frames; meaning that the sound quality is not as good as it could have been, the mikes for the crowd at toronto weren't set at a high enough volume (during Breakout, Grohl asked the crowd to sing the chorus: you can hardly hear them), expected some music videos but none were included.My Judgement: This DVD is damn good, provided you're willing to suffer a little bit from the sound quality at times. The lack of music videos is a bit of a sore point with this DVD, but it is still worth buying."
2,After years of waiting.....a true dissapointment,"I know that title sounds a little negative but I have some good reasons for it. I'll start off with the good points about the video. It was nice to see the recent live concerts like the one from Toronto. I also like the way that there was a variety of songs on there such as Weenie Beenie, I haven't seen them play that live since 97. Although, I found it dissapointing because the live footage was only very recent (I would loved to have seen some older stuff on there). Also, I did not like the way they did not include any music videos. I have always thought that the Foo Fighters always have great music videos. It would have been ideal to have a two disc set- one live 95-03 and the other made up of music videos and maybe some more behind the scenes stuff. After being a Foo fan since the beginning and seeing them 6 times in concert since then, I was extremely dissapointed with the material on the DVD."
3,Good but missing something special,"The Good:1. It's the Foos. 2. It's 3 Hours of the Foos Live 3. It's a cheap DVD considering the content 4. It's worth the asking price just for the acoustic section alone!The Bad:1. The 5.1 Mix is horrible and make's Dave (Grohl) sound like he's singing in the bath (Stick to the Stereo track) 2. Half of the content is an ""audio only"" concert which covers nearly all of the same tracks as the video content, which is a disappointment!The Unforgiveable:1. After waiting so long for this DVD, i'm left feeling it could have been so much better 2. It doesn't convey the raw power and joy of seeing the Foos live, due to the soundtrack.These coments may seem harsh, but when you see DVD concerts such as Joe Satriani live in San Francisco, then you know what could have been."
2,Disappointed,"I love the Foo Fighters to death but this DVD just didn't do it for me. The live concert in Toronto (which takes up most of the live footage) just didn't have very good sound quality. Also, as others have mentioned, half of the live songs are ""audio-only"", accompanied by a slow-moving slideshow of concert photos. Why?! Finally, I think it would have added a lot to the DVD if some other bonus materials like interviews, footage of the band not on stage, and their song videos were included. Overall it was definitely a disappointment...better production next time?!"
1,Telling Lies,I found this book not easy to read and not what i was looking for alot or rhetoric there was no clear information worth noting in this book. I would get another of his books on face reading before this book.
2,this book is not worth your time or money.,"very watered down book, just common sense, nothing remarkable. I looked & bought the Dummies book & it too is a major waste of time. Possibly I am expecting too much.sorry"
4,Entertaining and informative,"I really enjoy Dr Ekman's writings. He could easily include too much medical training/lingo, but he avoids it well. His methods are easy to follow and reveal the steps he used to come up with his conclusions. He even includes the information that seemed to contradict his conclusions, but explains his thoughts on it all. He also invites others to review his work and critique it.This book won't help you become a human lie detector. Honestly, it's just a tv show. But, it does provide additional skills that some may need when dealing with people at work, ect....I will be looking for more of his work. Fun and engaging. Well worth the read."
1,"Great light, don't last","I have five garden lights in enclosed lantern housings that have been using thesebulbs for the last year or so. At first I went thru six bulbs until I got some thatlasted for last six months. I just had another fail. They don't seem to like cold weather (28 to 32 degrees F), and may have trouble starting. When they work the light output is very good."
2,Do your homework before you purchase....,"Do your homework before you purchase this product. It lasted only three nights (36 hours) before it burned out. To be fair it was used on a solar system, which did not fully recharge in the winter months. This may be a problem for this bulb. The previous bulb it replaced lasted three years. It may be just fine with constant power."
2,12v fluorescent update,I used this lamp in a 2 lamp fixture; one failed after a few weeks warranty?? I even secured the lamps so they could not vibrate with a wire tie;now one of lights very dim other works fine !update 2/21/2013 Received 2 lamps and letter of apology and company is to revise lab testing of life to use vibration of the lamp in determining lamp life. Prior the lamps were in fixed sockets in a lab.
4,Cabin Fever,"For the short period of time we've been able to enjoy our cabin and living off the grid, the Camco 12V-15W bulb has made life easier."
2,Disappointing,"This is a great concept. You can use any light socket or lamp, connect to a 12 volt system, and you have an energy efficient light source. Unfortunately they do not last! They burn out very quickly and at 10 bucks a pop they are not worth it. I have not found any way to contact the manufacturer to find out if there are any special requirements for increasing the life of this product. Wal-mart sells a 12 volt bulb with a 1000 hour warranty for $1.50"
1,They don't last!,"Bought 4 of these for a solar system. ONLY used them in one socket, withing 4 days, 2 were already blown. They do not handle fluctuting DC voltages such as those seen in a solar system. No built in regulation. I've use many items for years off the 12v solar that are sensitive equipment; to include Cell Phones, external Hard drives, and a wireless cellular repeater. So, in a nut shell, a waste of money!"
4,Good Value,"Bought two of these...used them in a solar backup system in a room. Used one for over 6 months without any problems. The other one I bought was used for a month when it blew a drive transistor internally. After a quick inquiry on google to get the transistor type and ratings, I headed to the local Radio Shack and bought the closest available component as well as two more sets in the event of future blow-outs. Getting the case apart left the case slightly blemished but changing the blown part was easy and straight forward. The good bulb that has been in service without blow-out gets quite warm, leading me to believe that these transistors are driven too hard to not have any heat sinking. So along with the repair of the blown transistor I added small aluminum heat sinks. This fixed the problem. Overall, typical product from China but looks good and works, just don't use in really hot environments (ie. +90 deg F)."
5,A Worthy Classic,"This book is the first I read on coaching - and it is still my favourite. It introduces the very practical GROW approach to coaching people effectively. It is written in novella form with learning points concisely and clearly presented. Great advice - As a coach, remember to ask for feedback on your performance too!"
1,One Night Needs to Stand Down,"There was one vocal: ""I know Why I Waited"" that was excellent. The rest of the music was beyond horrendous. At least as far as I have gotten. I have not been able to make myself listen to the remaining 40% I should have just downloaded the one vocal from I-Tunes. The upside is it didn't cost me very much money."
4,Huge Improvement,"What happened? The first game was almost completly a waste compared to this. The graphics are great, gameplay is challenging, and the music ISN'T painfull! Though at first the game may seem very confusing when figuring out the controls. Yet soon you'll find it to be very clear. The storyline is actually understandable and doesn't go that far out from the show. The only problem I have is the amount of characters. If they added more than this game would have gotten five stars."
4,"Cool, but quite difficult ^^;","Well, I've only had the chance to play with this game once, but I like how you can switch between characters. That way, say one character's health is getting pretty low; you can use another one with higher health power so the previous character doesn't die. In addition, if you choose the right character at the right time, you can deal the enemy quite a bit of damage. However, although the techniques, character change, and graphics are cool, the game was rather difficult in my opinion. Then again, it wouldn't be as exciting if it were really easy, now would it? :p It probably takes a couple of tries to get used to all the new functions. I'm going to try it again when I have a chance to see if it gets easier after a couple tries..."
3,Not the best it could be...,"The music sucks and the game is super-easy! I beat it in 1 hour. It's a waste of money. The bosses are SO EASY!and,Naruto's sexy jutsu does nothing because none of the charcters you fight fall for it! Rock Lee's jutsus are sucicidial! Once he finishes one,he dies! Sakura is weak and lame! The enemies are losers! The 1st one is better. It's actually a challenge. Don't buy this if it costs more than 10 bucks,if you do,you get ripped off. Fun if you suck at video games,boring otherwise. Heed my warning..."
5,Great customer service!,I am very happy with the soap refill. It is hard to find the right refill and we got it right the first time. There was a mix up on the quantity and the company was very accommodating. I am very pleased with the outcome. Fast delivery too!
4,"potential, later fulfilled","This album is perfect for lesiurely listening. Essentially just stripped down folk-rock, the gritty guitar production and loud drums immediately bring Neutral Milk Hotel to mind. Any similarity to Jeff Mangum's work ends in the production though. Brimming with energy, this album carries more similarity to the quirky majesty of Danielson. It's chock full of legend and lore, and seems intentionally absurd. Here, in place of the pretense and poise of coastal-american indie, we find a band steeped in magic and senselessly pounding out songs on churning guitars and reverberant drums. The childlike energy and absurdism make the album extremely endearing. I really enjoy the fact that they didn't pile every catchy song into the first four tracks as well. The album is consistent throughout, and while his lyrics lack the power of the aforementioned artists, the album showcased thier potential."
5,Excellent camera.,Excellent camcorder. Great picture quality. The original battery life that comes with the camcorder is a little short when I use the LCD screen. Need to buy an extra one.
2,This would have been an excellent 200-page book!,"Joann T. Hackos's book offers some interesting concepts, such as information plan, project plan, and content specifications, to name a few. Her concepts are well hidden under mountains of text that the unfortunate reader has a difficult time finding or understanding her intentions. Her book is information technology-centered, and technical communication has so much to offer other industries, such as oil and gas, healthcare, and financial, regarding project and documentation management. This book is not a good choice for college-level courses."
2,Managing your Documentation Projects,"Another long-winded academic thesis. It lacks the ONE thing that documentation managers and writers need: the tool. There is not a single example of a project plan or documentation design doc. There is no CD with templates. What a disappointment. By the time I finish reading this, my project will be due."
5,A MUST HAVE for Technical Communicators,"This book is about the process of managing documentation projects. Since my company adopted the methodology described in this book, all of our projects have come in ahead of time and under budget...no matter what the size of the project.The methodology helps communicators and clients focus on what is important in the development of information products. By focusing on what information users need to do their jobs, content becomes obvious.Understanding the process of information development is critical to being able to measure the quality and effectiveness of the work. Only by adopting a policy of continuous process improvement can we increase our value to our organizations and to our customers. Dr. Hackos provides the method for doing this. While it was written in 1994, I still find it applicable in 2001!"
3,Verbose,"This book was verbose and not as helpful as I had hoped. It has some good information, thus my three stars but I think it is too long and not the best."
4,Practical Documentation and Planning Guidelines,"This book is excellent in educating the new technical writer, but goes deep enough that experienced writers will gain from the wisdom provided in this book.It read easily and you can read a chapter, independent of having read other chapters.Good examples and sound practical information you can use to plan your documents."
1,First 28 Pages are Blank,"I received this book in a timely manner, but the first 28 pages of my copy are blank. Yep, blank."
4,Neverending Tribute....,"Plain and simple this CD isn't half bad. I've loved the movie ever since I first saw it back in my early years. (I'm not that old now. [lol]) I have the original soundtrack which is nice, but having a CD with the movie theme was a decent idea. The new take on it doesn't compare to the original, and it [isn't bad]either. Sabrina and T.H.T. do a good job doing their take on the original, and fairs quite well. The five versions are each a little different in their own way, and of course, are quite dancable to. Now if only dance clubs could catch on to these kind of hooks, and they'd have me there."
5,A small error.,"This supurb set of DVDs, some of the greatest television of all time, has one minor defect that I point out only for those interested in such triva. The last episode on disk three, listed as ""Treasure Trail"", is really ""Hunt the Man Down"". The second episode on disk four, listed as ""Hunt the Man Down"", is ""Treasure Trail"". The ""Wire Paladin"" in both cases refers to the episode that should be there rather than to the episode that is there."
4,Why the subtitles?,The season 2 eposodes are terrific but after hours of trying I still can't find a way to turn off the Spanish subtitles. This is a 5 star set if you can figure a way to shut off the subtitles.
4,As Expected,This is my second season of Have Gun Will Travel. The first was unexpectadely good. This season leaves nothing to be desired except that I wish they would get THE WHOLE SET OUT.
3,Great DVDs but spanish script at the bottom irritating,"The DVDs are very good and it's nice to go back to the days of Paladin. Would have been a lot nicer if there weren't scripts written in spanish appearing throughout the movies at the bottom of the screen. A bit irritating since it takes up (two lines sometimes) a good portion of the screen. Then, in spanish, to make things worse. Otherwise very good."
5,One of Schifrin's best.........,I found this gem of a record at a Goodwill in my area. I picked it up for its unusual cover. To my surprise it is one of Lalo Schifrin's best works. I'm so glad I didn't let this one go. Can't wait to own it on CD. Please reissue Verve Records!
5,"Gee, back again please!",These songs were the most important album that I've ever heard! This is a trip! I have LP but CD is CD.
2,You get what you pay for...,"I was planning to use these page protector for my children's 8x10 school photos, but unfortunately they are being returned. I found the pages to be flimsy, warped (don't really lay flat due to the thin material) and produce glare."
5,Great for photo albums!,"Decided I would get these for all of the boxes of pics that I have stored. Instead of putting new 8x10 in front of the framed old one, I can now have them in an album to access more easily or view. Very pleased!"
4,"I love this song .""heaven""","I downloaded the song heaven performed live at the fillmore.It's different than the album one. Pretty good ,but faded in and out though."
5,Texican Show Down,"This is a great album and while I have never heard the studio version I'd still prefer the live version. I have completely fallen in love with Ringo's drumming talent.""Onda"" and ""Dime Mi Amor"" are the hottest tracks."
4,Good but not great......,"Fantastic band...a breath of fresh air in todays music biz....however this is not a great record mostly because of the sound quality and for those familiar with the band and the other live cd they have out....it seems plodding and slow.....performances are good and the addition of Reese Wynans on keys is fantastic but if you really want to hear these guys smoke...see them live or pick up the other live cd they have out called"" Live At Blue Cat Blues"""
3,My Favorite Band - A Little Disappointed Though,"Let me first say that LLB is one of my favorite bands. The idea of a live LLB CD had me really excited. I'll admit that they are ""good"" live. Actually much better than just ""good"". I'd happily see them live any time. What has me a little frustrated with this CD is the ""slowness"" of the tempos of most of the songs. On many of the songs, I found myself saying ""pick up the tempo guys!"". I also found the guitar solos sort-of wandered all over the place. Sometimes it sounds like a garage band ""trying"" to jam. Other times it sounds amazing. I also noticed that the tempos change way too often as well. You can't play a song at three different tempos, and too slow to begin with! I'm not knocking the guys at all. I'm just saying this doesn't do them justice. They can do much better and maybe should have waited for a more polished concert to make into a CD."
2,Bland Live Album,"Yes, I know, when a band plays the Fillmore it should go down as magic in music history. And, having seen the LLB several times live in Concert in the past couple years I have seen some awesome musicianship and incredible live playing. Unfortunately this album seems to sterilize their sound and spontanaeity and loses the great feeling I've seen from them live. Maybe they were nervous about recording and wanted it to be perfect? WHatever the issue, it does not come across well for me. Either my expectations were too high or something, but I took this CD back and was greatly dissapointed. I expect someday that they will release a true live rocker someday that really captures their awesome live sound, but this ain't it."
2,Far from a gem,"This nicely produced book contains stories from the author's personal experience with baccarat and a table summarising data from 160 shoes. His ""rule of three"", unfortunately, is NOT supported by the data. Thus the merit of the book is limited. Kayser's book is more useful."
3,Some useful info,"Although this book does not recommend any specific system to employ at the tables, it does however give the reader a breakdown of result occurence (banker, player) which could be used when anticipating the best time to place a bet."
3,Great gambling stories,"I found gambling stories in this book that I never heard of.As to making money playing baccarat its still about a 50-50 chance. You have to get lucky, and Stewart admits it. With a large bankroll I believe you can make money if you are patient and will accept small pay offs. Outlines story of Australianmillionaire that beat Las Vegas but does not go into specifics of exactle how he did it"
2,"Utter nonsense, but with entertaining anecdotes","Stuart writes some warm and amusing anecdotes, but his gambling advice is completely crackers and what's more, is so vague as to be useless even if it were sound."
4,good book,i improve my game since i read this book.this is 1 of book that give necessary advise for us to follow
2,not worth it yet,"This is one of those films that loses too much when not in widescreen. You have to spend the entire first scene, several minutes long, listening to John talk while looking at Brian's face. Rent it if you must, and wait for the widescreen version."
1,Awful!!,"This was the worst Beatles type movie ever!! There are some disturbing scenes that you better be prepared for, the whole movie is on speculation on what happen with John and Brian.............Bad just bad, and this coming from a die-hard fan of both The Beatles and John Lennon!!"
3,the best of fan fic,"i love the concept of this film. it's classier than silly beatles fan fic because it simply is an intriuging story--beatles or not. budget shortfalls are way too visable though, and the acting isn't nearly as good as the director would like us to believe. further, the director's commentary and interview are incredibly BORING. he laughed ONCE and smiled just a few times. don't buy this...just rent it off netflix."
2,Film School Stuff,"What happened on the infamous holiday taken by Brian Epstein and John Lennon? Rumors long swirled about an erotic encounter, never confirmed by anyone, least of all Lennon. This film purports to imagine what went on: But it's pretty dull stuff, though the Lennon character has his moments, especially with a flight attendant. Epstein is just boring. I only watched this with one eye because it was so dull."
1,"Boring, Dull Homo-Erotic Rubbish","This ""art house"" type movie is written and directed by Christopher Munch. He's a gay man who obviously has a fantasy that John Lennon and the Beatles manager Brian Epstein, had a homosexual affair while on holiday together in Barcelona Spain in 1963. Viewers should know that this movie is pure fiction and based on nothing more than old scandalous, tabloid rumors.Thankfully this tedious and extremely low budget movie is only about sixty minutes in length, because there's really nothing to keep a viewer interested in the story. The ordinary sets, contrived dialogue, unimpressive direction, and lack of any kind of intrigue, action or real drama resulted in a film that almost put me to sleep.Maybe ""gay"" Beatles fans will find this story interesting and to their liking, but I think the vast majority of Lennon fans will find this movie boring, and quite possibly offensive. (Because the premise of this movie is a lie!)Mike"
5,This songs's` PHat,I think this song is really awsome and if you like good west side rap this is what you want to buy.
5,Great collection :-),"This is a great collection of songs. You usually get the same mix over and over just for the sake of selling discs, but this at least has a great and varied variety of songs both old and new that will bring back memories or keep you up with some of the more recent selling singles. From Duran Duran to Gary Jules to Eurythmics to Nelly, there is certainly something for everyone."
4,Streams of music embedded in seemingly random sequences,"It's an audio version of an impressionist painting... listen to it with your eyes closed. I like this CD. Of course, I like Graham Haynes. I wouldn't play this in my car, and it's not dinner music. I listen to this when I'm feeling escapist and want to let my mind wander."
3,Long winded but does contain humor,"A comedic exploration of the oxymoronic term military intelligence during world war one from the point of view of the long-winded vejk, who always has a tangentially related tale at his finger-tips to relate the futility of the status quo.The story has probably lost much of its power in the time that has past since it was first written or the cultural divide was too wide to grasp some of the humor. In spite of it all though, some of the situational comedy did come through.I couldn't quite ascertain if vejk was truly an idiot or only pretended to be one in order to more perfectly combat the hegemony-- at times I was sure he was pretending and then at others I lent towards imbecility.In all, not quite the excellent read for which it was recommended. I'm glad to have read it, however, as perhaps it will garner more insight when reading Catch-22."
4,The Good Soldier Svejk and His Misfortunes...,"Perhaps one of the most comical books and best acerbic political satires ever conceived, this book is utterly permeated with sarcasm and the farcical adventures of the ""good"" soldier Svejk. Putting the defects of the Austria-Hungarian empire into the limelight Jaroslav Hasek hillariously dethrones them. It is a weeping shame however that the novel has not been completed as it quietly dies shrouding the rest of Svejk's adventures in mystery. Also, one might say that the ""toilet humour"" and sarcasm together with the convenient misadventures become somewhat monotonous and cliche after the first 300-400 pages. And yet, despite its weaknesses and length, ""The Good Soldier Svejk and His Fortunes in WWI"" undisputably deserve your attention."
3,Great Book; Poor Translation,"This is a wonderful, hilarious book, but it's butchered by a very poor translation. And not only is the translation often inaccurate, but the translator considerably softens Hasek's (vulgar) use of language. Until a better translation becomes available, learn Czech. It will be worth it."
3,Customer service skips a beat,"The LD-50 is a great product . . . but the customer service from Casio just doesn't keep the beat. When using the web for technical support, the page on the company site simply says ""page not found."" When calling for customer service using a number found on the site, the caller calls one number, then is instructed by a non-native English speaker to call a second number, and then instructed to call a repair facility in New Jersey. When calling that number, if the phone queue is full, no matter the time of day, the caller will just be disconnected. So be careful: the purchaser will have difficulty obtaining any kind of information on his or her product. So this buyer recommends a purchase of an inexpensive instrument that can be repaired through a local music store where you and your music keep time. Don't mess with this company's so-called customer service."
1,"Sorry, but I have to rant about this","It's very weird to say this, but I HATE how a perfect little girl she is. It's annoying. She's always the heroine, it's EVEN more annoying!"
3,Pretty good book....exactly what I expected...but boring....,"I think this was a pretty good book, but why does Ann M. Martin always have to make Karen be the heroine? It's like Karen's a perfect little girl or something-the way she always solves mysteries, the way she always gets perfect grades in school, the way she has tons of friends, the way she's so popular just because she's in a club with two of her perfect little friends, the way she's ""married"" to a boy in her class-it just makes it sound as if Karen's the most perfect little girl in the whole world-and no one's perfect-the Baby-sitter's Little Sister books are just too unrealistic. In real life, it takes days, even weeks to solve mysteries. In this book, it only took Karen about three days to solve 'the spy mystery'. I think this is an okay book, but I think Ann M. Martin could make the Baby-sitter's Little Sister books sound a lot more realistic."
5,5 Stars all the way!,The three earlier reviews pretty much say it all. I agree 100% and wanted to add another 5 star rating.
2,Very disappointing,"This book is basically a collection of games played in the Scandinavian Defence, VERY poorly annotated by the author. Don't expect to learn anything from the author's comments to these games. No insights about what's going on, no discussion of ideas or plans for either side. And besides that, the book is poorly organized, as sub-variations within the main lines are hard to follow. Don't waste your money.I recommend John Emms' book instead."
1,Chinese trash,"The washer hoses were advertised as ""made in the USA"" when in fact(after I recd them) they were made in china. Look guys-please be honest about your ads. Thanks."
5,"very good book, good presentation","this is a great book for learning about wireless. all the basics are covered. it covers all the practical consideration of setting up wireless and has just enough depth to get you started.its different than the other books because it talks about all the wireless technologies {bluetooth, wlan, gprs, cdma, wap} instead of a single focus. really good for coming up to speed on all wireless in one fell swoop."
5,Finally a good book that is not too complex,"This is a book that everyone interested in wireless technologies must read. It clearly explains the major concepts, provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation together with useful practical advice. Even though I had been familiar with the concepts I enjoyed reading it and recommend it to anyone seriously interested in mobility."
5,Far more than just recipes!,"If you love food and cooking, you will adore this well-written and fascinting book. It has some wonderful recipes (try her way of ""assembling"" polenta and gorgonzola and you'll never eat it any other way!) but it's her essays that make this book so special.She writes lovingly about food, and shares great insights into the world of cooking and 'gourmet' restaurants (for example: ""It is a long-standing sentiment among professional chefs that American recipes, while quaint and cozy, really do need to be sent off to finishing school abroad before they can appear in public. I suppose they aren't elegant enough for your average gourmand. Yet what is a French meringue but a mess of egg whites? Or creme brulee but a bowl of pudding?"") Ain't it the truth!This is one ""cookbook"" that belongs on the literature shelf -- yet it also has some of the best recipes I've found.Buy it ... read it ... use it."
2,Loved the story - hated the download,The download was not readable all the way through. I like to read at night with the letters in white and a dark background and it wouldn't allow me to do that all the way through.
3,A KIND OF COMEDY BUT ...,"I bought this DVD because of Timothy Hutton, one of my favorite actors.It's a romantic? comedy during one night in San Francisco, a city I adore, but here is almost the same if the city were any other in the world. They wasn't use the wonderful landscapes of San Francisco, even when most of the plot is during the night.About the comedy itself, it was a little dissapointing. Something is missing here, like the magic of real comedy and real romance. Some parts are really boring, so I recommend this film only if you're a big big fan of Tim Hutton, who showed in a better way his skilling acting in other movies or TV movies than in this one."
5,"Romantic, sexy, original, flawlessly produced comedy.","Just One Night is a romantic, lively, sexy, original, flawlessly produced and directed comedy set in San Francisco where, one night before his wedding, Isaac Alder (Timothy Hutton) is in a cab that collides with Aurora (Maria Grazia Cuicinotta), a beautiful married woman. There accidentally meeting results in love at first sight and a 24 hour wild ride through glittering San Francisco and a memorable exploration of two people on the meaning and nature of love. Highly recommended viewing!"
1,A Really Bad Movie,"I bought this DVD because the story sounded interesting, and because I really liked Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People. This movie is really stupid, low budget, and silly. It's just so unrealistic and dull.Save your money and order a good DVD such as Ordinary People. You'll regret buying this movie. It's just as bad or even worse than that Stanley Kubrick film Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise starred in a few years ago. Utterly forgettable"
3,santa snow globe,Cute...one globe broken when I took it out of the package. you get what you pay for...
5,Snow globes,Our grand daughter loves snow globes and these were no exception she plays with them all the time.
3,Disappointing,"La Vida Segun Muriel is a film I know well. In studying Spanish, I have borrowed it from a library and watched it dozens of times. The music on it is spectacular, as is the cinematography and the story is poignant. The copy I finally bought from this vendor has less than good quality music. They offered me to return it, but I have no guarantee that after going through yet another transaction, the soundtrack will be as full as it was on every library copy that I watched."
1,Very unhappy.,"My daughter was given this scooter as a birthday gift. At first it seemed really great,sturdy and all. A few days later the piece that adjusts the height on the handlebar broke off !! A few days after that another piece broke off! She did not get hurt,but could of got hurt. we are just concerned that it may happen to another child. Be very aware! And once again what happened to all the ""old fashioned"" quality made toys? Everything made lately seems like JUNK!!!!"
2,Things falling off!,"I got this scooter, for my birthday.When I was riding it the piece that adjusts the handlebar broke off! I did not get hurt.I am worried that maybe this might happen to someone else. and they may get hurt!Today another piece broke off. My mom said ""I can not ride it anymore"".And I am getting a new razor scooter over the weekend. Thats a different brand! Before it broke, it was alot of fun."
1,Not very impressive,"I had to return it the next day, got error message saying to remove and reinstall tape....found tape to be partialy stuck in camera upon removal...damaging expensive tape...not cool! This happened every time a tape was inserted. I only managed to get 20 mins of recording in before this happened. I did like the quality of the still pictures, much improved over my GRDVL510.The 510 has not been without problems ....frequent head cleaning notices.. not to mention the pixelated images. I was using JVC tapes and was advised by JVC to switch brands ...now using Sony..so far ..so good.I have to say my 8 year old Sony 8mm handycam still works and has never required a head cleaning. I should have stayed with Sony products...You live ..You learn."
3,Next day return,"I would like to have written about the good features, but on the second day, as I was watching the tape, I somehow disconnected the ac adapter, & zap, it died. I later read in the manual, not to disconnect the ac adapter while the camera is on. What happens if the power at home goes out while you are playing it?"
4,Nice Camcorder,I got mine using hotel points so I didn't have many choices but I do ilke what I got. The camcorder is packed with a ton of features and capabilities. What I have used a lot and can tell you about is the digital imaging capabilities. I have taked a ton of stills with this (with 128 MB SD card there's plenty of space). While the size (almost 2 Megapixels) is rather big the quality leaves a little to be desired. I'm anxious to get the firewire cable to test out the digital video (one of the main reasons I bought this).
2,"Superb Ergonomics, Terrible Audio","This looked like a great camcorder in the store. It was easy to use, the buttons in all the right places. As soon as I bought one and it arrived, I realized my mistake. The camcorder has a constant buzz when you start using the DV tape to record or playback. This buzz is recorded onto the tape, since it seems to come from the tape motor which is unfortunately very close to the right audio channel.Video quality was decent with only a slight washout of colors. The Night Alive feature was pretty useless, with bad focus and poor color; however, the front light was nice for low-light conditions. Zoom was smooth and well-positioned.The 3.5"" LCD was VERY nice. I'm definitely hooked on that feature.I'm going to try the next model up, the GR-DVL920U, to see if it has the buzz problem, too."
2,User friendly but Poor images,"This camcorder is user friendly with many great functions but, unfortunately, performes poorly in low-light situations or while shooting indoors with poor color reproduction. The color improves a bit with the NightAlive function but the shutter speed is so slow it causes a blurred image. NightAlive function cannot compare with the superb effect of MagicPix that Panasonic provides on their camcorders. In good light the picture sharpness, although good, is nowhere close to a SONY.I returned my JVC GRDVL820U and am buying a SONY !!"
4,Who Is The Biggest Faker?,"This movie is about lies and half-truths, but it does not start out that way.The film revolves around Natalie Press' Mona and her interactions with her born again brother Phil (Paddy Considine) and the suspended boarding school, rich girl Tamsin (Emily Blunt). Phil finds the Lord in prison and turns the pub that his deceased Mum ran (and where he and Mona live upstairs) into a place for prayer meetings and services. Tamsin and Mona have a chance encounter on a country lane and wind up spending the summer together and falling madly in love - teenage crush style. Things unravel at the end with all three showing their true colors.The film is beautifully shot by Ryszard Lenczewski in West Yorkshire and Lancashire, England. And the director, Pawel Pawlikowski, has a deft touch and moves the characters and story gently forward."
3,good mailing service weird movie,The mailing and reciept of the product was great but the movie itself was hardcore weird lol. i was just completely baffuled by it.
5,not just an emily blunt showcase,"Which is not to say she isn't one of the best things about this wonderful little film. If you're a straight man over 30, you might feel a bit like a perv watching the two lead actresses make their magic, but that goes away in short order. Beautifully lyrical photography, and a air of mystery pervade the film. Smart script, too. Highly recommended."
5,Great with deep meaning,"My Summer of Love is a great coming of age movie set in the English countryside. It's also a deep meaningful movie. The only drawback is the English accents, which might be difficult to understand."
1,What the..,"Late at night I began to watch this and at first thought it was a cute little movie about two girls who liked each other. Boy, was I wrong. The end was sickening and very dysfunctional. It made the rest of the movie feel like a joke and lie. The plot twist may appeal to some people but I thought it was horrible. At the end I felt disappointed that I'd stayed up until 2:30 am to watch it. If you like liars and faked suicide and attempted murder this movie is for you.Come on young lesbians, don't watch this crap just because you want movies about people like you. Besides, I hope nobody is like these girls in real life."
1,Awful,"Words can't express how disappointed I was by this film. The title should have been called My Summer of Lies. Love?! Don't start me -- if everyone had such dysfunctional trysts the jails would be full. Maybe I am expecting too much from a lesbian film to hope that it wouldn't end as it did: in betrayal, attempted murder, anger, pain and despair. And lies -- oh so many lies. Try Saving Face for a beautiful sweet lesbian romance -- this is none of these things. Simply awful, disturbing and depressing."
1,Great for Insomniacs,"I so wish I could say something good about this movie, but I cannot. I'm middle-aged and do not need a lot of excitement in a film, but this one truly bored me to tears. I've read the other positive reviews and wonder if we lesbians are just so craving something that we can relate to, that we'll accept anything that comes along. If this is the case, then there are many other lesbian movies much more worth one's time. Put this at the bottom of the list."
2,This movie is a waste of time,"I give it two stars for holding my attention to the end. But after the ending, I just felt let down by the movie: it didn't make sense and it wasn't even likeable."
2,awwwwwwwful boring,I MEAN THIS HOLE LESBIAN THING IS OVER RATED! OVER RATED BECAUSE NOT UNTIL YOU EXPERIENCE IT YOU CAN RELATE! NOT UNTIL YOU ENDURE THE PAIN AND BLISS YOU CAN RELATE AND THIS MOVIE JUST DIDN'T CAPTURE THAT WHOLE LOVE RELATIONSHIP-TYPICAL LONELY RICH GIRL AND POOR CLINGY GIRL-RICH GIRL TAKES ADVANTAGE OF CLINGY GIRL-WHO IS LONGING TO LOVE KINDA REMINDS ME OF LOST AND DELIRIOUS! FILM WAS LONG BORING AND THE TWIST AT THE END WAS SO BLAH! I PERSONALLY WANTED A DIFFERENT PLOT-SAVING FACE IS MUCH BETTER!
3,well detailed,"This book has lots of useful details (length, difficulty, scenic value, etc) about virtually every canoe route in Eastern Pennsylvania, however its drawback is that it doesn't highlight any best picks, so it is hard to decide on a route to try when you are given such an overwhelming number of choices, many of which are seasonally limited."
2,Organization is confusing.,This book is hard to follow. It seems randomly organized. Trails dot com gave me way better information than this book.
1,Don't order this product,"After taking these shirts out of the package I unfortunately discovered that Calvin Klein uses a cheap and damaging tape on these shirts. The sticky part of the tape is embedded into the fabric of the shirts and does not come out. So, now I have two shirts that are ruined by the tape used in the packaging. They are acceptable only as undershirts . . . expensive, sticky undershirts."
4,High Quality Publication for Learning the Basics of Sustainable Design,"A very easy to read book that will help anyone, with or without an architecture or design background, to understand the basics of Sustainable Design. Well written, with very precise, intelligent, and oftentimes humorous commentary. Mr. McLennan knows his stuff, and the only thing in my mind that he could be faulted for is not going deep enough on some of the topics. That is the nature of the book, however. It is mean to be a high level overview of all aspects of Sustainable Design. Mr. McLennan has been very thorough, though, in including tons of references for those of us looking for a deeper understanding of any of the topics mentioned in the book. A must have for any aspiring architect or designer and a fabulous addition to any arcophile's library!"
4,Christmas gift,"This is a Christmas gift, therefore I don't know how durable this will be. All I do know is my 3 yr old will LOVE it!"
2,Kindle edition,"The kindle edition of this book has poor layout for the Kindle. The book consist of numerous bulletpoints, all of which has been indented so that less then half the width of the screen is used for the text.The content and the style of the book are ok. It gives you, as a starting pm, alot of things to think about. However, it does not dwell on any topic. Which makes it just a brief overview of the topic."
3,A bit too disjointed,"I find this a bit jumpy, hard to keep the context. Examples may be a bit dated."
2,Too Basic,"Individuals with any experience in running a project, whether it is a small focused job or a large-scale product development effort, will find subject treatises too fundamental. The chapters lack the in-depth coverage and focus as the apparent goal is to present a broad-based overview of basic concepts in the field of project management.Here is a guideline to use in deciding whether or not to purchase this book:How comfortable are you with using the Microsoft Project software?If you are very comfortable with MS Project, I recommend that you try ""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge"" instead.If you have never used MS Project and/or have no idea what it does, then you should probably buy this book."
5,PM for Dummies,A 'short and sweet' version of Project Management. This book is great for getting familiar with the concept and terms of project management. The simple breakdown of the processes involved in project management is priceless!
4,A good place to start,"When i started preparation for the PMP certification exam the first book i read was the PMBOK guide. i must admit i found it a bit difficult to understand. Acting upon the advice of a friend i procured a copy of this reference and wnet through it. Its pretty straightfwd but at the same time it enhances one's ability to appreaciate the concepts of the PMBOK guide which because clearer to my mind. hence, i would say its a good reference to start with. going back to basics is sometimes good!"
5,"Hard to Find, Works Great","This is a hard to find bag for my old Dirt Devil, and is not manufactured by Dirt Devil. Have had no problems whatsoever. Definitely recommended."
2,Is Evan Returning to Rock?,"I loved Evan's first CD. Smooth jazz with a great guitar sound. This CD has too many rock riffs, it sounds like he's the lead for some very poor heavy metal band. A couple of good tunes, but to me, he's heading in the wrong direction...."
1,Rocking oldies like the Flippers,Seemed to be a citate of rocking oldies like The Flippers - nothing smooth at all
2,shallow,"I bought this book based on the reviews I read, but i had found the book to be a shallow piece of work. I am a Yoga teacher and a meditation specialist. I was looking for some inspiring ideas, but found none. This book is not what is seems to be."
3,Cute but kind of cheap.,My children got this & the Humpty Dumpty Jack In The Box for Christmas and the original Mary Had A Little Lamb toy just didn't work. I ordered a new which works fine and my children love it. I just don't think it's made very well. The top/lid bends very easily and the handle/crank always feels loose.
1,Disappointment,I was greatly disappointed by this book and could not bring myself to finish it. Horrible and a total waste of money
2,rain go away,"These nerf bars must have a chrome coating thinner than a piece of toilet paper. The first time it rained I found them starting to rust, and had to quickly get out some chrome polish to remove the rust"
1,If you like torn paper this is the way to go!,"Apparently Savage has the worst quality control ever. Product arrived with several tears that went over 6ft into roll. With the packaging still perfectly intact, so someone at savage doesn't mind selling damaged goods as new. So poor quality control and horrible customer service leave me stuck with 4/5ths of what I paid for. Ive done a lot of research online and it arriving horribly torn is very very common!!!"
1,"Same Problem, tears all over",I ordered this same paper from B&H Photo. Same thing as others report: Tears in three places along the shaft at least 6 feet deep. You can see my images in the images section.
1,Crap,"It is really not the shipping fault its how it is packaged. If you get one of these and you cant get it out easy at all then it will rip as it comes out. I have order 8 of these now and all but 3 came out with no rips.My school says that this is one of the best places to get paper backdrops and it is, if your not getting them through the mail. Not all will be ripped, but a enough will be. DO not go though the people who make it, but the company that you order from and if they still don't give you your money then do a a-z clam and you will get your money back."
2,"Apparently, Mr Levin has an axe go grind.","He takes many liberties in trashing Chrysler products of the early 80's. For instance, he states that chrysler's 2.2 engine was based on ""twenty year old technology"" yet he offers no evidence to back up this claim. Mr. Levin also carps about the lack of technology in Chrysler's cars such as using a ""beam axle"" while conveniently overlooking the fact that other cars of this time frame used solid rear axles quite frequently. Nor does he give much coverage to Chryslers lowest cost per unit, the VNT technology used in its turbo cars, the fact it had OHC engines on the market LONG before GM and Ford, the first domestic auto company to use airbags in its cars, the firs electronically adaptive transmission.Mr Levin admitted he got little in the way of cooperation from Iacocca and it appears he wrote this tome to vent against a good yet flawed man and a great company."
2,Not happy with packaging.,"This book is over 100 years old and it was put in a paper mailer without first wrapping it. The mailer contained tiny granules of the cover that had worn off due to the way it had been packaged. The binding is cracked on the inside and there are considerable markings on the inside i.e. underlined text and words written in the margins and above words. This book is not in good condition, it is in fair condition. I am disappointed that the seller did not wrap this book properly for shipping considering its age. Thank you."
4,Read the biography!,"If you enjoyed this book, you'll be fascinated by Carolyn Burke's wonderful biography, Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy. Rich, detailed, dishy, thoughtful and unabashedly feminist, it explores the complex relationships, feelings and events underlying Mina Loy's work and restores this forgotten writer to her rightful place in American and international literature."
1,Average MC at best,"This CD is average at best. I wouldn't recommend it to the average hip-hop fan as I feel the CD is lacking in the beats compartment, as well as overall quality, and lyrical flow in general. It you want to listen to quality christian rap I would recommend that you look at the 1-1-6 clique's 13 letters CD, Lecrae, Flame, Trip Lee, or Da TRUTH. As all of these rappers really bring it and in my mind are comparable to the top secular rappers today. So my advice would be to not waste your money on this CD go out and buy a Cross Movement or Reach Records CD which is christian rap at its best."
4,Ultimate awesome cd,Loved this Cd; one of my favorite rap cds. He has a nice heavy voice and good beats.
4,Ed scores with another winner,"My copy of this book is in Hardcover and with any of Ed Greenwood's work you cant put it down.I hear rumors of Elminister will ""die"" sometime this year; however, depresssing that is it is also a relief. Ed then will be able to continue righting more fine books like this and maybe open up more knowledge of the 7 sisters."
3,Good solid fantasy (B-),"This is a good book, the previous books in the series where better, but this one ends the series well. It probably would have been great if they would have kept Ed Greenwood away from the writting!OVERALL SCORE: (B-)READABILITY: (B-), PLOT: (C-), CHARATERS: (B), DIALOGUE: (C-), SETTING: (A+), ACTION/COMBAT: (B-), MONSTERS/ANTAGONISTS: (B), ROMANCE: (B-), SEX: (n/a),AGE LEVEL: (PG)"
2,Mechanical Failure,"This highly innovative contraption is a wonder to behold, and had problems staight out of the box. I inserted my memory card, loaded the paper tray, made sure every setting was right, and pressed the print button. The paper immediately popped out the back end. Then, I spent the next three hours checking and rechecking the manual, doing everything right, and only got three prints. I strongly suggest that you find an alternative, since because of the mechanical design of this printer, I'm sure my problem is very common."
1,Did not work for me either.,"I had high hopes... but it did not work at all. I tested on a small fire ant mound, a spider and a big slug. After 3 days of watching them it had not effect at all. I re-applied the second day but still nothing. Does it really work for some people?"
1,Beware: these do not stick!,"I got 3 sets from this company- the upper case letters, the lower case letter and the numbers. I couldn't wait for my granddaughter to play with them. She put the letters on the magnetic board and they slid right down. Unbelievable. These are supposed to be ""magnetic"" letters and numbers, right? Seems to me that the most important part of that would be for the letters to actually be MAGNETIC! Forget it. Once in a while a few of them will stick, but then they start to tilt or slip down a bit and of course, as I said, some of them just plain slide right to the bottom and don't stick at all. Very disappointing. I was excited to get them because the size of the letters and numbers is so nice and big- but, trust me, they do not work. The magnets are not strong enough."
2,Not very useful,"It's small, light-weight, and is supposed to work on both types of valves without switching any parts. I bought it at my LBS for a mountain bike and put my Topeak Road Morph G (which I highly recommend) on a road bike that needs higher tires pressures. This pump sticks on a schrader valve, so in pulling it off, I whacked my finger on the brake disc twice, and got a nasty blood blister from it. At 40 lbs it's extremely hard to pump and I couldn't get the tire over 48 lbs. With the Road Morph G I had no trouble getting the tire to 60 lbs. I wouldn't recommend this pump unless you have very powerful arms."
1,Eats valves on Presta,"terrible pump, ate three tubes in a row, very hard to remove on presta tubes, snaps the heads off, and you will never get your tire past 40psisurprised Topeak did not recall and dump the lot!"
4,"Works great, a little goes a long way","I have moderately wavy hair that blow-dries straight, and this mousse is great for when I want to enhance the waves. I just work a little through my damp hair and scrunch it, and it holds waves pretty well. I've had one product that worked absolutely perfectly - CitreShine mousse - that I found in London, but I was unable to find it anymore and so I bought this. It's not perfect (hair will fall flatter after a period), but I've tried a lot of similar products and I really like this one."
2,Not good for the car,"I bought this in advance of a long car trip. My lower back can get sore after extended drives, even though my car has decent lumbar support and I sit up straight with the seat almost as straight as it will go.The main problem with this as a back support for driving is that it is too large to use and remain sitting straight. Underinflation is an option, but it is not very stable in this configuration, even when driving straight. So my back is more mobile and this actually adds more back strain than it helps (especially when cornering).I will try this in an office chair but I am not optimistic that it will be useful.The valve is the standard one used in cheap water wings and other toys. It works okay but makes inflation/deflation harder than it would be with a good valve (like you'd find on a Thermarest)."
1,WORST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE,"ORDERED THE PRODUCT, USED FOR A HAPPY MONTH, AND THEN THE PRODUCT DEPLETES IN 15 MINUTES, NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY. AND AMAZON DOES NOT ALLOW RETURN FOR OVER 30 DAYS. A TOTAL WASTE. I HOPE THE MANUFACTURE WOULD AT LEAST PROVIDE WARRANTY. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.GET YOURSELF A PILLOW INSTEAD, MUCH MORE DURABLE.JUNE, 2012 UPDATE:THE SELLER IMEDIATELY CONTACTED ME AND SENT ME A REPLACED ITEM. GREAT ATTITUDE. I AM CHANGING 1 STAR TO 3 STAR. I HOPE THIS TIME THE REPLACED ITEM WOULD WORK OUT LONGER. IF IT WORKS OUT WELL, I WILL UPDATE.AUGUST, 2012 UPDATE:2 MONTHS HAS PASSED, IT STILL WORKS.AUGUST, 2012:AT THE END OF THIS MONTH, THE PRODUCT LEAKED AGAIN. THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A PRODUCT THAT COULD LAST."
4,Great support...took several tries,"I love this back pillow, but my first 2 or 3 had leaks over a very short period of time. Why would I even try it multiple times? Because it's really a great product:-Easily Inflatable and Deflatable-Folds up so you can travel with it easily-Tremendously comfortable - better to have it inflatable so you can ""customize it"". Make it right for your needs. Also, if you're flying, as cabin pressure changes, you can alter the pillow so it stays the way that you need it.Now...I had this air leak issue. I contacted the company and they sent me several for free...just in case it happens again.The first of that batch they sent me is still the one I use...meaning the issue is solved!"
1,Great for the first 2 weeks,This product worked great for the first two weeks. Somehow it developed a slow leak and no longer holds air for longer than 6 hours which means I have to refill it everyday. Not sure how this happened. It's been in my car since I purchased it. The quality could be better.
3,The end of the affair..,"I love(d) this product, but alas it doesn't seem to be manufactured to last. The first one I bought stopped inflating and staying inflated within a few days. The replacement one that I was sent after contacting Amazon has made it for a few months and now seems to stay inflated only about 20 minutes when not sitting by itself. Once I use it will driving it deflates in about 20 minutes. Disappointing."
1,no staying power,"I bought a Back Booster about six weeks ago. Inflated slightly and installed in car. After adjusting amount of air for comfort while driving, I used it for two or three weeks. Then the air went out, the booster lost its boost. Blew more air in the next time I drove and it lasted two days before deflating again. Apparently the valve leaks. Not repairable, it appears."
5,Good product,We buy the back booster 1001 inflatable lumbar support cushion and this product help my doughter in th high school seats.
4,Great Product - Great Customer Service - Thank you Dr. Greenberg,"Back Booster provides great lumbar support!Lasts long (over a year) - more than most inflatable lumbar supports.. and definitely worth the convenience!Everyone needs better lumbar support or you will inevitably end up with low-back pain and tight muscles.Stretch daily, Take breaks often (i.e., don't sit for more than an hour at a time), and don't slouch! (you can't slouch if you have lumbar support :)"
5,Back Booster is a great product!,"After back surgery, I needed more support for my back and this is the answer! Since it is inflatable, it is easy to get a perfect fit. Heavy-duty product material, and great price. I am using this product eight to ten hours a day, and it is comfortable and stable throughout the day. I highly recommend it! Very fast shipping also!Back Booster 1001 Inflatable Lumbar Support Cushion"
3,Temporary help,I purchased this pillow for a 3 day car ride. It worked great for the ride there and back and I started to use it while watching TV. After 2 months it no longer holds air. It worked great while it lasted!
4,Good adjustable lumbar support for travel,"This product works well for travelers using rental cars or airlines. I gave it four as opposed to five stars because the adjustment process (blowing into a tube then trying it) is inherently a litte tedious. And over-inflating can be bad for your back as well.On the other hand, it stuffs into your carry-on/briefcase with no problem and works well once adjusted. So the ability to deflate it completely is also inherent to its value."
1,back booster disappointment,I bought 2 of the back boosters because my husband and I both have had back surgery and need lower back support in the car. We were both very disappointed in their function. To much air makes them hard and a little air is very uncomfortable. One of the booster leaks and is always flat. We would like to return them for a refund if possible. Thank you
2,deflates too soon,"I had the same experience as Robert of Niagara. It worked well at first, but it developed a leak after a week of use in my car. It quickly became useless.This happened twice. (Thinking that the first one I bought just had a defect, I foolishly bought a second one.)"
2,lumbar cushion,This cracked along the seam within 2 weeks of use. It had the proper support but is of inferior quality.
3,Back Booster 1001,"This a great idea. I have a travel pillow made out of the same material. However, the seams on this cushion are not as good. I weigh 185 lbs and half-inflated it and it sprung a seam leak after only three days. The pillow I have for travel still works after 15 yrs. If the manufacturer of the cushion could strengthen the seams as good as my pillow, I would buy another."
1,It's a bust!,"I've purchased this product twice in less than 1 year. While it's very helpful when inflated, after a month or so it won't stay inflated for more than 30 minutes of use. I figured maybe the first one was just a dud, so I purchased another one. I still have the same problem - I use it in my car driving to and from work (a 45-minute drive)...I blow it up every morning and by the time I get to work, it's flat. I blow it up in the afternoon for the drive home, and again, it's deflated by the time I get home. I've had the same problem with both of the supports I've purchased. No only is it inexpensive, it's cheap and not worth the air it takes to inflate it twice a day!"
1,Leak after 6 weeks of use,Pillow started to leak after 6 weeks of having it. Leak is in a seam and deflates completely on 30 mins. Return policy is 30 days. Be careful....
3,Good for travel,"This is a good travel support cushion. It folds up small so it will fit in a purse or backpack. It doesn't take too much effort to inflate. I'll use it sometimes if I know I'm going to be at my computer desk most of the day. It worked great for me for about a week, but I think it may have a small leak already somewhere."
3,Good,Works quie well but has the same problem of many others in that it is tricky to empty the pillow because of the construction that helps prevent leaks. I have looked far and wide for a back cushion with a little pump and valve for fine adjustments but have not found it yet. Some sleeping mats have such valves .
3,worked great -- for a while,"I liked this back cushion so much I got a second one. But then after a few months, I found they won't stay inflated. So it's become a bit of a hassle to re-inflate them before use."
2,Doesn't stay inflated.,It doesn't stay inflated. It's fine for a short time but loses air quickly. I've tried several times so I plan to return it.
1,Leaks - Don't waste your money,"This cushion lasted just long enough that I couldn't return it to Amazon. It developed a severe leak, and would not stay inflated for more than a few minutes. In looking at the reviews, other people experienced this same problem. Buyer beware. Don't waste your money on this product. It was a good cushion while it lasted, but one does expect something like this to last a bit longer than 40 days.Update 02/2008: The manufacturer saw this review, and sent me two replacement Back Boosters at no cost to me. I must say that I am impressed with the company's extremely proactive willingness to make things right. I will test out the replacement, and post a further update.03/28/2008: I would agree with the review from ""Cat's Meow"" posted in January, 2008. Three stars - it's an adequate product, but not too helpful for someone with severe chronic back pain."
1,Bad Product,"Pros:Has soft fuzz-type exterior.Cons:Strap did not fit around car seat well. Will not fit any bucket type or indented seats. It would work on a flat backed chair, but otherwise the strap is superfluous and gets in the way.The curvature is not adequate and being inflatable it does not hold its shape well. A firm type foam back support I had once that has a similar (but more pronounced) curvature and is much better.After a day or so of using it in my car it went flat."
5,Saves my back,I have suffered from backpain when sitting for 20 years. I have finally found something that I can take anywhere. I LOVE SITTING NOW!!!!!! Thank you so much. I have recommended this to all of my bad back friends.
2,longevity,"I have purchased the back booster two times. I was disappointed that the first one failed, but pleased at it's portability and support so I decided to take a chance and get a second one. Now, the second was has failed as well - only 4 months old! I am hesitant to order a third one. I use this on long flights which I only do two to three times a year and I am having to buy one every time I fly so, not such a great financial solution to lower back pain. Will try another product"
2,Bad Back Booster,"Having a bad back, I was looking for anything that would help the pain. I watched the infomercial and was impressed with the product. I ordered the item and it was received with great expectations. It took very little effort to inflate and I was ready to use it. It stayed inflated for about two to three hours but gradually lost its firmness as it began to deflate. It obviously had a leak. Contacted Amazon and they authorized a return.Have since pruchased another product (considerably more expensive) made from memory foam and it it's super."
2,Deflates overnight,Does what it needs to do---but has a slow leak so must be reinflated every 24 hours. That's a disappointment.
2,...started out fine but...,...suddenly it deflates quickly.while it worked it was excellent. I have to locate the leak.Worked in the car (a few times) as well as home. I have had it for a month or so.
5,Picky Shopper,This product lives up to its name. It will keep a hot liquid hot for at least 6 hours and warm up to 20 hrs.Perfect when the first person up at 5am makes coffee and you don't have yours till 8am. Coffee is piping hot and fresh. Worth the money.
5,BETTER,THIS WAS AFTER THE HUNT FOR THE RED OCTOBERBUT DIFFERENT JACKHARRISON FORD IS A VERY POWERFUL ACTOR AND ALSO IN THE NEXT ONE
2,(FLASHES OF LIGHT!) But Top 12 Movie,"There are FLASHES OF LIGHT throughout this BLU-RAY! Annoying white ghosting/flashes in dark areas of the screen, especially during some low-lit indoor scenes near the beginning. Too bad, because this movie ranks in my top 12 favorite movies - A classic suspense thriller."
2,Not one for the Irish peace process,"Reactionary, right wing rubbish. That's how best I could describe this drivel which wastes the talents of Harrison Ford and Sean Bean as the laughable, constantly scowling terrorist in a film which required sensitivity and subtlety. Sadly, Patriot Games provides neither, in this all too simplistic tale of so-called good vs evil, which has Hollywood stamped all over it."
3,"Lean and mean ""Games"" still works","The movie that essentially kickstarted Harrison Ford's second action career, ""Patriot Games"" is a solid entry in the Jack Ryan series, firmly ahead of ""The Sum of All Fears"" and fighting tough with ""Clear and Present Danger."" It's a little light on the action, but high on a rich buffet of characters and intriguing plot -- Ryan witnesses and stops an IRA assassination attempt while on vacation in England and spends the rest of the movie surviving their revenge."
3,Ok movie it shows the IRA what they really are,I have read some of these reviews with amazment that some people actually support the PIRA and their campiagns of bombing and killing on my country and in ireland when they are nothing more than thugs who go around murdering innocent people and who do not even represent a majority of northern ireland the loyalists do.

2,"Ok movie, many mistakes","Alright, I thought on the whole this was an ok movie in terms of plot and action. However, I definately do NOT like the portrayal of the IRA. This is where the movie falls apart. Sure the IRA are terrorists. Sure, they kill innocent people. But the British are not innocent angels here. The British have oppressed the Irish for centuries, letting millions die from the potato famine, and generally treating them like dirt. And the conflict that is still going on in North Ireland is not innocent British against evil IRA. There is innocent blood being shed on both sides, and this movie has utterly failed to portray it that way."
3,Just asking....,"I know it's only a Hollywood movie. And the book it's based upon is fiction and hardly Tolstoy at that.But I can't help wondering if it's plausible that even a militaristic Republican would so eagerly accept a title from the British Royal family. After all, these would be direct descendants of people who probably ran Ryan's own ancestors out of their homeland!Also, the incredibly irritating pub scene portrays Irish-Americans (yet again) as dim-witted, belligerent drunks who simply adore imbecilic sing-alongs about ""Irish laddies.""Understood that the villains are supposed to be psychos and very hissable they are, too. But couldn't the writers have avoided perpetuating so many narrow and simplistic cliches?"
2,Needs Software Update,"When I received this Blue-ray disc, I was disappointed to see that I cannot play it on my 2-year old, top of the line, Sony DVD player until I go to Sony's website and install a firm-ware update on my DVD. I haven't had time to do it yet, so I don't even know if it's possible, but something to think about before you buy."
5,Powerhouse film!,"Here's one of Harrison Ford's best movies. Here, he plays almost-ex CIA agent Jack Ryan, who after saving his family and the British royal family from a assaination atempt by terrorists, gets caught into some sticky situations when the leader of the bad guys, swears to make Ryan's life miserable after Ryan killed his brother (who was trying to kill Ryan's family.).Why wasn't Tom Clancy happy with how this film was made? The movie was very well made, in my opinion. It had great directing, great acting, a mean and evil villian who causes conflit almost every half hour of the movie, edge-of-your-seat thrills, and great action sequances, and the screenplay AND the book were very darn creative. It's impressive when someone puts a movie like this together. It's a must-see movie for those action and Harrison Ford fans everywhere!"
1,Beware! The Blu-ray STINKS!,"I have no idea how the transfer process works, but there is something really hinky going on with this one. It's almost like it has a filter over it that looks vaguely like a screen door. It's most obvious in darker shots and it also pulsates, to make it that much more annoying. Paramount needs to step up and do a decent transfer."
2,I get this `meh' feeling...,"The issue I have with `Patriot Games' is that, at the end of the day, it just feels so anticlimactic. The ending felt rushed and put upon. Nothing leading up to it felt truly suspenseful but more like a collection of scenes that were supposed to build intensity but managed to do nothing of the sort. When it was all over I didn't care much about it. Aside from that pretty big snafu, there isn't really much to complain about. It is competently made and technically fine. The music is perfectly suited to the genre, the acting is decent enough (Ford is Ford and this is yet another role he can snarl through), but the story is just so `not there'. It just felt so unimportant and empty. The thrills are barely registered and the characters are somewhat boring. I understand that Jack Ryan has a following, and so maybe those familiar with his character can find development that the film didn't have, but for those of us unfamiliar, this was just rather hollow."
5,Patriot Games,PATRIOT GAMES Is a great movie with excitement all the way through the book. Harrison Ford does an outstanding job. I loved the part that Samuel Jackson played and who does not love James Earl Jones. It was a fantastic interpretation of a wonderful Tom Clancy book.
4,Harrison Ford strikes back,"Not the best Jack Ryan but passable.watch for Samuel L Jackson being underused as set decoration.Sean Bean is practically wasted, being hired only to scowl and fill some tight t-shirts.It's the technology being showed off."
5,Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time,"Patriot Games is a great movie, based on the novel by Tom Clancy. Former CIA Analyst Jack Ryan (Played by Harrison Ford, who replaced Alec Baldwin) intervenes in an attempted terriost attack on the royal family. The brother of Sean Miller (Sean Bean), one of the terriosts, is killed and Miller arrested. Miller is however broken out by buddies (Who are in the ULA). Now he wants to get Ryan.The whole film itself is amazing and suspenseful, with excellent performances. The only problem was the ending. Sure the boat chase was good, but it was too short. You should have made it longer and more exciting!"
2,"Good Flick, Terrible Blu-Ray","Though I really like the movie, this might be the worst looking blu-ray movie I've seen, and I own about 50. There is all kinds of light colored pixelization in the darker parts of the film that pulsates and distracts. I tried to find a feedback system on Paramount's web page, but no such thing seems to exist.Very disappointing."
2,poor quality they need to recall Blu-ray,The movie is good but don't waste your money on this blue ray version there is a pixial problem flashes of light and ghosting images throughout the movie. Terrible picture quality! I exchanged the one I had at target only to get another one of the same poor quality with the same image problems -don't buy it until they fix the problem. I see another person is noting this problem in their reviews here as well. There is no contact number on the DVD box and the email to Paramount pic. goes no where. Target 800 # customer refunds went no where and they were rude on top of it. I had hoped they could give me a contact number to get a replacement. Hopefully there will be enough omplaints that a contact number for recall will be given or posted. Very frustrating and so far a waste of money!!! I will wait to get the other DVDs in the series now.
5,A Rare Look Into Cheyenne Life From One Who Lived It.,"Seldom do you see into the Cheyenne and plains Indian culture from a Cheyenne who lived and crossed both worlds from the traditional free roaming nomads to the reservation period. This is a well written, first person account, that is not embellished or edited to make a statement or to make the Indian what we would like him to be. It is raw and real. This is a must read for any student or lover of the plains Indians as they really were."
4,informative yet not what I thought,"Though I am not finished yet I have to say that it is a very informative book on the indian way of life. If thats what you buy this book for then you wont be disappointed. By the title you would think it was all about the Little Big Horn battle and though I'm sure it will come to that, so far (one third though the book)it has only mentioned life of the plains indians and how they built their tee pees, how they war'd against each other and also fought together. As I said I haven't finished yet but I like what I've read so far."
4,Great comeback -- terrible price!,"Angel Delight is not only one of Fairport Convention's very best ablums, but it is one of the greatest comebacks in rock history. I use the term ""comeback"" not in the sense that the previous albums were weak, as they were just as good. But to lose Sandy Denny after Leaf and Leige, and then Richard Thompson after Full House, and still have the talent to put out a work of this quality is simply amazing. High points for me are Lord Marlborough and the classical-tinged instrumental Bridge Over the River Ash. Unfortunately, the boys then let things drop off rather percipitously after this album with the very forgetable Babacombe Lee (good concept, poor execution). But why on earth is this album priced at $25? And only one measly bonus track (a live version of the weakest track on the album) for that hefty price? Come on, if you want me to replace my album with the CD, get the price down to the normally ridiculous high CD costs. I won't be buying this until you do."
5,Admit it; you want it.,"Yes, you never bought the LP because the Knack were played into the ground. Now is the time to purchase your guilty pleasure! C'mon now!"
5,This music is as fresh and relevant as it was 20 years ago!,I would give it ten stars if I could. I bought it when it first came out and find myself as in love with it as day one. Doug Fieger's lyrics are a time capsule of every young American boy's teen years. If only all of the music of my youth remained this close to my heart...
4,A surprising remaster.,Get the Knack ( 2011 Remaster ) [Original recording remastered]I have just finished comparing this release to the 2002 release (with extra tracks). It is definitely mastered without the usual playback level increase that seems to be the norm nowadays. When compared to the 2002 release the 2011 release has noticeably less output level. I prefer the 2002 release. Its just brighter (due to mastering level?..probably).
3,Party like it's 1979,"This album was released in 1979 when I was 16 years old. ""My Sharona"" was huge at the time, and in retrospect a milestone song, signaling the end of the Disco Era and the more or less start of the ""New Wave"" movement, or at least the beggining of it's absorbance into the Mainstream. In some ways it continues to this day. Yes ""My Sharona"" is a timeless classic and still sounds fresh today. But, there's ""My Sharona"" and there's the rest of this album. It sounded great at the time but sadly this album has dated rather badly. ""Lucinda"" was an excellent song at the time and I guess it still is but it's almost cringable to listen to now, likewise ""Good Girls Don't"". Buy this album if you wish, but you will probably find yourself skipping thru the rest of the tracks to play ""My Sharona"". The Knack were a good band, they produced a great album, they deserved their moment in history, but let's leave them there."
3,Knack Knack...Who's There?,Good quality product. No problems with the merchandise. Already knew the tunes from the original album...that's why I bought the CD.Good investment.
3,when we were young...,"...things were so different, there was space to create music even without being a superstar, just for fun. No matter if you could have been considered fuzzy (or nutty, maybe).That's what this album is. In my mind, of course -i've been listening to this album, since i was just a teenager and still i like it as a grown man, it remains fresh and enjoyable."
4,A Real Nostalgia Trip for Me,"""Get The Knack"" was originally released when I was in high school. I bopped around the house to ""Frustrated,"" ""Good Girls Don't,"" ""My Sharona"" ... all to the extreme distraction of my mother. :-) Doug Feiger and company put together an excellent selection of power pop that promised a great deal more than the band was able to provide. Their sophomore effort, ""But The Little Girls Understand,"" could not hold a candle to this work. If you are into late '70's/early '80's nostalgia, add this album to your stack."
2,They Didn't Get It,"Rarely has a band risen and fallen as quickly as did the Knack. Packaged as a new wave Beatles, they roared out of nowhere with the admittedly catchy ""My Sharona,"" and for a brief period became the biggest band around. Unfortunately for them, they had little to offer in the way of a follow up to ""Sharona,"" other than the overtly sexist ""Good Girls Don't."" Once you get past those two tracks, ""Get the Knack"" is pretty bleak listening. The songs are interchangeable and no longer have the new wave freshness that once made them at least passable.Overall, an underwhelming relic from a band that was one of rock's most spectacular one hit wonders."
2,weak,"""my sharona"" is ingrained in my memory, this is for me a real classic from 1979,but lets face it, it was all down hill down from there for the knack.This album for me is a waste of time, you are better off having ""my sharona"" on a various artists cd and leave it at that.The knack were one of the fastest rises and fall in rock history as they flopped on the charts after this album.I will alway's remember and associate the knack with ""my sharona"", a great song from the late seventies."
1,Get the KNACK - - why?,"In my opinion, ""The Knack"" is basically a 'One Hit Wonder' band! ""My Sharona"" is a fantastic song! However, ""Good Girls Don't"" is a decent (OK) song (I could be wrong, but I seam to remember this being on the ""B"" side of ""My Sharona""), decent songs like the rest of the songs on this CD, but definately NOT 'Hits'!I feel like I got this CD for ONE song. ""I Knew the Bride"" & ""That Thing You Do"" are the only other songs I can remember hearing before & the Knack MURDERED (ruined) both of them.My best advice would be to get ""My Sharona"" on a compilation CD like ""Hits of 1979"" or something similar.RK"
4,One singular sensation.,"What a pop time capsule THIS is! Crisply performed, energetic and slightly naughty, The Knack's debut took the world by storm. This was quickly followed by a backlash heretofore unseen in pop music...a widespread resentment of the band only because we liked them too much. They didn't molest any children. They didn't offend any racial groups. We just loved them, and then hated them because we felt stupid loving them.That's a shame, 'cause this is timeless catchy pop rock that will outlive any ""knuke the Knack"" memories.By the way, ""My Sharona"" is STILL one of the greatest mindless pop singles ever. Admit it. You know it. You love it. Get over it."
4,"Edgy, bluesy jazz fusion -- off center and wonderful","I wanted to take this one back to the store after I got it home, but I kept hearing stretches in some of the cuts that caught my ear as wonderfully off-center, a slightly dizzy combination of guitar licks and hammond organ riffs, somewhere in that dreamland between jazz and rock -- the darn thing grew on me, and here I am a hopeless fan. I'm gonna listen to this one a LOT."
2,"Skip this CD, unless you're into depression.","First let me state I had never heard of Mr. Bernard until I saw his cd in the rack. I purchased the cd based on the music description on the cover of the cd itself. It sounded promising as I am a fan of blues/funk/jazz guitar music (j.golub, r. cray, etc.). No doubt about Mr Bernard's virtuosity is there, but this cd is overshadowed by a darkness of sound that is cast over the entire the cd. There are not any light moments here. The hammond organ sound completely wipes out the lead instrument of Mr Bernard. I was beginning wonder whose album this was any way. The organ dominates instead of accompanying the guitar. Looking forward to the next cd by Mr Bernard though, as there is something about his playing (as little as was heard) that is appealing. Wait til then unless you're into the darkness of the hammond organ as presented here. Later."
5,Wonderful,I use this as my main fertilizer for my peach tree. I love this fertilizer. I noticed the leaves got much bigger after applying this and I had more growth than normal. I am expanding my fruit tree collection and this will continue to be my main fertilizer. Next time I will buy te granulated form I think it will be easier. Overall it is wonderful and I will be buying again.
2,did not work,I followed the instructions just like it said but I never notice any improvement on my orange trees. I will just stick to cow manure for fertilizing my trees.
3,kind of good,"the product looks good but you cant nottice the diference in the palm since the grow really slow, but what i didnt like its that after open the pakage i used only 2 spikes and the ones i left for later break up i dont know why, the went really soft and break in a lot of parts... may i had to put it in a closed box or something and i just left it in the bag the came."
1,I ordered the wrong size,"I purchased the wrong size bag. It was a gift for my son. The item cost was $42.00, When I took it to UPS to return it they wanted to charge me $56.00!!!!! Obviously I am not going to return it since that would cost me more than the purchase price. Im very disappointed in this purchase and the return policy. It really is making me second guess if buying through Amazon is the best way to go"
3,"good bag, but photo misleading","Beware, this is NOT a hard or semi-hard case, it is a soft padded gig bag. Yes a good bag, with pockets, shoulder carry strap, etc. but I was looking for a stiffer case, not a gig bag.... see the photo, it appears to be a semi-hard case, doesn't it? again, a good bag if you are shopping for a bag, but it is not a semi-hard case, as pictured in the above photo"
4,good for keyboard,"It is good to carry a 76 key keyboard. Looks durable only I think it will be better if it has a separate bag for the book holder.shipping in a big box, which is good to keep the shape of the bag."
1,Underperforms and Overpriced,"I agree with the other negative reviews. The blade is poorly designed, so there are always big chunks of ice or food material left over. It doesn't matter how high a speed you use, or for how long. There are other design problems as well. It's difficult to get a good seal at the bottom, so stuff leaks out a lot. Finally, the spout on the pitcher is way too small. You always end up dripping stuff all over the place. For the amount you're paying, there are a lot of better choices (e.g. Waring)."
4,"great job with mixed drinks, pureed soups","This blender makes wonderful, icy mixed drinks! All of my previous blenders struggled with effectively crushing ice, but I haven't had a problem yet. I also love the wide mouth jar for pureeing hot soups. Cleaning the base is a breeze with the soft touch smooth buttons -- no spaces between buttons for dirt and dust to hide. The cord wraps nicely in the base. Overall a great design."
2,Bad rubber rotator coupling,"I bought this blender 3 years ago and really loved it. I used it twice daily, and also liked that it was a fairly quiet blender. However, after three years the rubber teeth on the rubber rotator coupling seem to have become brittle with age and started breaking off. For the price of this blender I would have expected a better lifespan. I will not buy another one of these, and am shopping for another make."
1,Broken Tooth Blender,This blender lasted 2 years and then the rotor teeth broke. I have been using this blender at least 2 times a week to make smoothies and the rotor teeth started breaking off. It does not appear that I can easily replace this part so I will be looking for a new blender. I recommend that you keep looking for a blender that has been around for some time and has withstood many years of use. That is what I will be doing. Good luck.
2,It Looks Great on my kitchen counter but.....,"I wish the FUNCTION was as good as the FORM. One thing I have shared with others after buying and using this blender is JUST because it comes in the designer color you want is not a good enough reason to buy an appliance, especially $100 on a blender!Being that I try to get my appliances in COBALT BLUE I bought this blender two years ago.It does the job of blending but is messy to pour from, hard to clean, and just doesnt seem to work as well as other blenders at half it's price. I love my Kitchen Aid Mixer...it looks good AND most importantly performs well.Wish Kitchenaid could have made this blender to work as well."
1,smoothies not so smooth,"although this blender is beautiful, mine wasn't able to perform even the most basic of blender tasks adequately. despite several minutes of full-speed blending, it left a banana smoothy full of banana chunks big as marbles. even my old $25 blender could handle a soft banana! as decor, it's fine, but as a blender, it doesn't cut the mustard (or the banana)."
1,Color not as indicated,"I ordered the Cobalt Blue color, so naturally I was expecting the blender to be blue. When I removed it from the box, I was surprised to see that the lid was actually purple, and the base was a purplish-bluish color. Not only did the purple color not match what was represented on the website, it did not even match the color on its own box. Amazon was kind enough to send out a replacement, however it also was purple and had to be returned. I did not use the blender so cannot comment on its use, but wanted future buyers to beware in case they expect a true blue because it definitely is not that. I am re-ordering it in black, hoping that Kitchenaid does not mess up such a basic color (or non-color). I will write another review after I use it!"
2,Not for everyday use,I burned two of these machines in 10 years. The last one lasted three years. I was using it daily to make smoothies for two persons. In addition I used it to make soups with cooked vegetables periodically. I can't imagine whhat would have happened had the vegetables been raw! It's a great machine if you use it occasionally otherwise you better invest in a more powerful machine.
2,The stop and start again Blender,"Bought this blender ...and thought that it would blow away the old Osterizer we had. I mix a smoothie every morning with strawberries, blueberries, cruched ice, honey, liquid lecithin, juice, protein powder and ground flax seeds. The blender starts and then stalls with the flashing red lights all going (very pretty if I needed a Xmas decoration), have to start it again and hold the button down to keep it going. If I let go, the flashing lights come back and have to start over. Eventually it actually runs but it does make me pine for the old reliable and cheaper Osterizer..."
1,$100 RIP OFF--Rubber Coupling's a JOKE,"We purchased the 3speed version about 4 years ago. I was so excited, as our Kitchen Aid mixer has been wonderful. From the beginning, black gook accumulated under the container. And now, although hardly used, like everyone else, the rubber coupling teeth shredded apart, ruining my dinner (I was making pureed soup of cooked carrots), and getting black particles all over my counter. I called Kitchen Aid, and the lady seemed to be ALL to familiar with this problem, and tells me I can send it to a repair center, the closest being a two hour drive. I am SHOCKED that this can happen so easily and so quickly with a $100 blender. I would NEVER buy one again, and would certainly read other people's reviews of other blenders before making another purchase. People are shelling out a lot of money for the name brand, and they're being ripped off."
5,One of best blenders you can buy!,"What can I say... KitchenAid does it again! What makes this blender so good? A. One of the quietest blenders I've ever used. B. Very good chopping power. C. This machine is built to last! D. Built with glass and stainless steel E. 5 speed with pulse options F. 5 gallons capacityThe thing I don't like is the design change they made with Picture and the motor unit. This is hard to describe, but I'll give it shot. There is a motor a middle plastic thing and the picture is on top. Most blenders have two - the motor and the picture. The picture and middle thing are meant to stay together. On many occasions, I've had guests that try to use this blender and remove the picture from the middle thing. This results in all of the liquid falling out the bottom and causing a big mess. I've yet to understand this design? But if you know how to use it, It's the best!"
5,Nitro-Powered Outlaw Culture is Just the Way I Like It!,"My boyfriend gave me this book for my birthday and I can't put it down. It covers all the things I love about going to the races. This book illustrates the excitement of drag racing from people who devote their lives to finding ways to go faster, entertaining a crowd and staying alive all at the same time!Leah Kerr's book beautifully describes a spectator's (like me) attraction to this sport. She lays out an easily understandable history that credits women like Barbara Hamilton, Della Woods and Paula Murphy (yeah, and the great Shirley Muldowney), for their racing determination. It's nitro-powered!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"All I can say is you'd better by one of these for every 20 degrees of coverage you need. The motion sensor has a very narrow and sporadic band of activation coverage, such that you almost have to walk directly in front of it. Sometimes it will trigger and sometimes it won't. If it can't sense a 6ft. human I don't have high hopes for it being able to sense a little ground critter. Range isn't all that great either; about 30-40 feet. Lastly when I forced it to go off, none of the squirrels or birds near me seemed to react at all. A total waste of money."
4,Seems to work for me,"True to the manufactures claim, this device has greatly reduces dog deposits in that part of my front yard that is covered by the device. As the instructions stated, it did take some time for the dogs to be trained (Pavlovs dog)but I am ready to buy two more, one for the rest of the front yard and two for the backyard racoons."
3,Decent book,"I bought this for an entry electronics class. When we did use it, the book was fairly helpful. The size and weight and small print may make it a bit of a headache for some students, though. Plus the index isn't the most useful. Overall, it did the job, just barely. If you have to get it for your class, well, sorry."
2,writings inside,The were writings inside one of the two books I bought. Some chapters of the book has been underline. The book look very old.
1,Book doesn't tell much about Philby,"Kim Philby's ""My Silent War"" may give a lot of insight into the British intelligence establishment during Philby's employment there, but it doesn't tell us much about Philby, his motives, his inner life, and the reality of what it was like to live a hidden life for so many years.Philby was a hotshot spy for MI 6 and may have had a significant impact, for good or bad, on that agency's success or lack of it. However, Philby plays his one motives and life pretty close to the chest. Kim Philby's ""Silent War"" doesn't provide the look at the man I'd like to see."
1,Philby has NOTHING to say,"The book has thirteen chapters and the first ten are painfully boring. The last three chapters, although somewhat interesting, lack significant detail to ever recover from the three and a half hours of your life you just waisted. Philby has much more to say about every day office politics than anything about espionage. If I was writing a book and had nothing to say this is the book I would write. At the end there is a four page chronology on Philby's life. Take two minutes in the book store and read the chronology and you will get more out of it than the 202 pages that came before it. The best part will be putting it back on the shelf and moving on to something more interesting."
2,my secret war -- still secret,"If you're looking at this book, you are likely familiar with Kim Philby's CV, so I won't discuss that. Rather than buying this book, I suggest you check it out from your local library, and not waste your money. All of the things that would make this autobiography worth reading are simply not there. Instead, you get Philby's smug account of his career in the most general, broad-brush terms. Egotistical, self-absorbed, self-impressed -- the author's writing style, and personality, makes for a very dull book. But, that gives you an idea of why he was so successful for so long -- he obviously thought he was the smartest kid in the classroom and could outwit everyone else. Other than that insight, I kept waiting for him to say something revealing and was disappointed. I'm really not sure who would find this book interesting."
5,6 stars!,"Wow! This book was so good! I didn't expect this book to be so wonderful. I went to the book store looking to buy a book, and this book caught my eye so I decided to read this one first, and boy am glad I did. I totally recommend this book to all readers old and young (not too young though, it may come off a little spooky), it is exciting and terrifying at the same time. I love ittt~! =)"
1,I did not finish it........,"I wanted to read this to learn more about the War in the Pacific. I found some good information regarding the Philippines, but it was hard to read and it did not lay the ground work for the big picture. I liked reading Bataan Diary by Chris Schaefer for a more well documented line of the War in the Philippines and I enjoyed Ghost Soldiers better for easier, exciting reading on the raid of Cabanatuan."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"HOUR OF REDEMPTION by Forrest Bryant Johnson is a thousand times the book that Breuer's is. Don't waste your $$$ on this one. Johnson wrote the original and it is the gold standard for the Cabanatuan raid (even far better than Sides' GHOST SOLDIERS).If you are interested in this subject, buy Johnson's book instead. It has been re-released and is available at the major bookstores as well as at Amazon.com. Johnson's HOUR OF REDEMPTION is the best WW II book I have read, bar none. I would highly recommend it to anyone, not just military buffs."
1,It's all a lie...,"Ask questions. The book and the movie that followed were both attempts to glorify the WRONG people. I'll admit that the Rangers had their hand in this rescue mission. But the REAL heroes are those of the Alamo Scouts. Look it up.I won't buy this book, nor will I support the movie...because the only reason the Rangers could participate in this mission was due to the help, and highly skilled Alamo Scouts. There is one book out on them, and their missions: Silent Warriors of World War II: The Alamo Scouts Behind Japanese Lines."
5,ranks right up there with the exorcist,"I read this book wayyy back in the 70s, and it's still giving me the creeps, even though I usually chomp through horror books like a little kid eats a box of cheerios. Been thinking of reading it again, but in 30 more years when I'm a little old lady will my heart be strong enough to take it?"
3,Could have been so much more...,"I just re-read this after many years. I didnt remember any of it. And i just wasnt crazy about it. It took SO long for anything to happen! The writing style was OK sometimes, sometimes NOT. I just think the story had potential to be so much more. Once it got near the end, it did get exciting and kinda fun to try to figure out. But i was sorta disappointed."
1,I wish that I had never picked up this book,"This is the first book that I have ever felt guilty about reading. I picked it up hoping for some plot-driven relief from a Henry James novel. While the plot was compelling, Tryon's pretentious style almost made me prefer James. Further, Ned Constantine and his family are the shallowest of characters and, even though I wanted to like them, I found myself hoping for their untimely ends. Ned was the one character in a position to unravel the secret of Harvest Home - or at least get away - but he made bad decisions at every possible juncture. In a book this length, it is asking a lot for a reader to believe that even a shallow, stupid man could be so blind. If you are determined to spend money on this book, buy it by the cord and use it for kindling."
2,Pretty dull if you ask me,"I thought nothing would happen for the longest time. The description wasn't great, the characters were not compelling. Bizzare cult behavior just so-so disturbing. Personally I did not firgure it out because I just was not interested enough to try. Figured there would be some human sacrifice involved, but didn't see who it would be until near the end. Is there some serious allegory here about masculine v. feminine or primitive v. civilized? Maybe but not well developed. Actually the book was mostly dull with a pretty silly ending and an over-the-top, fairly annoying style. Sorry fans, ""but I just can't go for that, no-o, no can do."""
3,"Very interesting novel. Eerie, like ""The Lottery"".","I have read this book twice in the past several years. It is one of those books from the 70s that my parents had as a harcover, and it just stayed with me, after I took it to college and beyond. One of the key reasons this book is interesting is that it evokes an ominous sense throughout the story. Many of the details border on supernatural, yet the horror is firmly rooted in a small bucolic town's obsolete traditions involving human sacrifice and a female hegemony. If you can find it, read it. It's a fun, summer read."
5,Killer Farm People a Must Read,"I read this book in the winter of 99 it was a great book. I love the way it keeps u in suspense the whole way through. They should really bring this book back into print, i know alot of people who want to read it."
4,Strange things go on in a small New England town,"Slow going at the beginning, this book picks up speed about 2/3 of the way through. Newcomers to a agriculturally based New England town discover some bizarre traditions and rituals honoring the harvest. Sexual situations and violence."
5,a great find,Had been looking for this all summer. Found it here for a great price! Thanks so much to the seller who made it all good!
1,Misleading title . . . it is no such thing,"I bought a book by Thomas Tryon called ""The Other Harvest Home."" He is the author of both titles so you would assume that it was a compilation that contained both titles. It is actually a copy of ""Harvest Home"" by the author of ""The Other.""There were cheaper versions of just ""Harvest Home."" The title of the book was VERY misleading. I would not order from this seller again without verifying what he/she is selling."
1,"she is not a bad singer, but the album is second rate","I had to give it at least one star, because she does have a beautiful voice. The lyrics and music for this album are really lacking though. I found this album to be a let down after hearing her previous work."
5,Cherubim Sing!,"I love her voice. I would like to get the lyrics to 'PRAYER', any suggestions? I haven't had much luck."
5,Inner Harmony-Cesilia,"As a child swimming with the Dolphins, she has captured the ESSENCE from within!! Taking you with them to EXPIRIENCE the Nature around us to levels BEYOND!! An invitation to FLY UP- FREE> > >"
3,A BUDGET COMPILATION WORTH THE BUDGET PRICE,"Three hit songs (""Got To Be There"", ""Rockin' Robin"" and ""I Wanna Be Where You Are"") coupled with eight album tracks. In true Motown tradition it, of course, includes some filler. However, this budget priced cd is the probably the best way to obtain one of Michael's best Motown recordings, ""Maria (You Were The Only One)"" (which was, incidentally the b-side of Michael's first solo single.) Until a great compilation of Michael's Motown recordings becomes available (""Antholgy"" ain't it), this isn't bad. (No pun intended.)"
3,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ancient Egypt,"I was a little disappointed in Dr. Ryan's book. I have both of his Idiot's Guides books on Lost Civilizations and Biblical Mysteries which are stupendous. I found that Ancient Egypt didn't quite pack the same punch as the other two and doesn't have anything new to offer to the study of Egypt. It's easy to read and interesting, but not quite as enthralling as his first two books."
5,Idiot's guides to any history is Fun for a hobby,"I am not a history expert. So these books are great intro's to a historical concept. Ive read:Ancient EgyptCrusadesWW IIWW IThis book and the others listed above are fun to read and make a good bathroom reader. My brothers come to visit, read these books in the bathroom then ask to borrow them. They've all been loaned out and passed around my family.I would recommend this book and the others listed above to a person who treats history as a hobby."
2,Vol. 1 best of christian comedy,"This was funny, I give you that. I was expecting more of Grady Nutt. So I was disappointed. Good quality, just not the kind of comedy I expected."
4,"Old or new, Timothy B. shines!","Timothy B. Schmit is by far one of the most talented artists around today. His pure, sweet voice and the great licks on the bass guitar are what makes him so special. It was nice to hear that he has always had his trademark sound, and even sounds better today. This album from almost 20 years ago stands up to anything anyone is doing now, and is a nice reminder of how songs sounded in the 80's, and yet has a contemporary feel to it. It would be a good choice to add to others by him, especially if you are a big fan."
4,Great contemporary of Buxtehude and Pachelbel,"This is fantastic music, showing a love of counterpoint balanced with a flair for melody; a must for anyone who loves Pachelbel, Buxtehude, or Corelli (whom Pasquini knew, along with Alessandro Scarlatti, during his lifetime)"
4,The adventure continues,"The second novel in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Venus series. Space-faring earthman Carson Napier was separated from his beloved princess Duare at the conclusion of the previous novel. Now, he is after her once again, determined to get her home safely to her kingdom of Vepaja, and the result is the literary equivalent of one of the old Saturday morning serials with just a pinch of social commentary. From the Room of the Seven Doors, down the River of Death to the City of the Dead, where a mad scientist presides over a kingdom of zombies, and the beautiful city of Havatoo, which is a paradise but only if your lineage is pure, Carson and Duare bounce from predicament to predicament. Will they survive their adventures? Will Duare drop her haughty facade and accept Carson's love? Is there any doubt? Not really, but getting there is the fun. This series benefits by being more humorous than most of Burroughs' work."
1,Professial Presentation But Dangerous Information,I used this book from April to June 2000 cruising the Bahamas on our way to Panama via the Windward Passage.I found if the wind blew from the east then the book did not give information on other anchorages that one could change to E.G. White Cay Berri Islands and Stanley Cay in the Exums.In other instances the best anchorages were not even mentioned by Wilson. The books G.P.S. waypoints were dangerous wrong E.G.George Town .The lack of information on entrances from the sound to the banks E.G. The entrance to Thunder Ball Cave area .It is my belief that this book is dangerous and it is best to find another guide book.
2,Looks good but disappointing in use,"During a cruise through the Bahamas in the spring of 2000, this guide was a great disappointment. The BA charts are woefully lacking in detail -- especially depths -- and discussions of shore sites are in many cases unduly negative. We visited a number of places about which Mr. Wilson used disparaging terms and found them delightful. Coverage of the Exumas assumes one is approaching from the banks side and gives little attention to approaches from Exuma Sound. In some places the author gets on a soapbox for environmental concerns and in other places he tacitly approves practices (such as feeding fish at snorkel sites) that are not ecologically sound. Fails to acknowledge existence of the Explorer series of charts that are by far the best for practical use in the area. In general, the ""yellow pages"" info is current and useful, but all things considered, there are better cruising guides for the Bahamas."
4,Review in ROMANTIC TIMES,"When a beautiful singer travels to Italy, she is shocked to encounter the sexy Italian who had stolen her teenage heart. While they can't deny that the love and attraction between them is still alive, they believe that building a new relationship faces too many obstacles, including his lack of faith, the hardening of his heart and RICO'S SECRET CHILD (4.5). Creating an amazing emotional intensity, Lucy Gordon once again delivers a heart-wrenching love story with extraordinary characters, a gripping conflict and wonderful story development.ROMANTIC TIMES, March 2000"
1,Not Store Quality Pics,"We bought this printer after a Salesperson gave it a high recommendation. We were told that the pictures would look like store bought photos. After hooking it up and loading the software we started printing. We were extremely dissapointed! Our pictures were VERY grainy. We tried switching the print option to best instead of normal, which helped but our pictures were still not perfect. The colors looked washed out, even though we were using the HP paper. Also, when we printed borderless pictures it wouldn't print to the end of the paper. We still had a finger width border on the left side(or sometimes it was on the right hand side?!). Maybe this can be fixed, but the software is difficult to understand and we were unable to figure it out. The best pictures were the ones we printed with the border, but it makes the picture small with a LARGE white border. Not exactly store quality! We are returning this printer to buy a more expensive (and hopefully better)one!"
2,Stay away from this one...,"...unless you only intend to print color photos in very standard sizes on very standard paper. Limited print features set....weak software interface. HP chat and email help is really worthless. AI ""I understand how you feel. I understand you want to print pictures?"" etc. etc. Manuals are very weak. No help on the website."
1,MY PHOTOS LOOK TERRIBLE!!!,"We have had our hp Photosmart 7760 for just 7 months and already my photos look TERRIBLE!!! The blues are turning green, the flesh tones are fading to white and the entire photo takes on a sickening yellow tone.I AM BITTERLY DISPPOINTED!!! The pictures are SO BAD that it is NOT WORTH spending the money for the ink and the photo paper.HP's solution was to use PhotoShop to add a Sepia Tone to the pictures -- YEAH, RIGHT -- then I'll have YELLOWISH-BROWN PICTURES!!!"
5,7760 vs 7960 vs i900d,"I started off with a Canon i900D but returned it because of the quality of photos. The prints were not real sharp and the color was off.I originally was going to buy the 7960 but since I do not do a lot of B + W and the larger LCD was not a big issue for me I decided to try out the 7760. I just brought it home and set up was a breeze, basically you just plug it in. I did have a question though and call HP technical help, got threw in a matter of minutes, the tech was nice and helpful. I printed a few prints and am impressed by the quality of the photos. It's a nice looking printer and I like the fact it's a little smaller then the 7960. Still too new to tell for the long hull but so far it's a keeper!"
1,junk,this was the wosrt item ever sold as used it probley came out of a dumpster. broken badly packed. and internal rust.bad business I would never sell any thing this itemto any one. bad bad.
2,Jams frequently,We have owned this for several years. The phot feature jammed and no longer works. We get too many paper jams. Ink expensive.
1,Lousy for anything but pictures,"Without fail, everytime I use this printer for anything other than pictures (i.e. just to print out a simple word document), the paper route jams, pulls in multiple sheets at a time, and/or says to add paper even though there is already paper in the tray, and a word document that should take a couple minutes to print out becomes a twenty minute ordeal."
1,paper jams,"I returned an epson 325 photo for having constant paper jams. All kinds of paper jams. I was told the 7760 was the way to go. Well, after 4 days, with calls to HP, It wouldn't print any envelopes. HP told us to give the envelope stock a little push. After that all we experienced were more jams, and ink all over everything.. We returned this unit. While in the store we noticed another customer complaining about photo paper jams with the 7760. We came home with the Canon i900D. So far so good."
2,"Great pictures, when it will accept the cartridges","The picture print quality is fantastic on this printer. HOWEVER, I am on the fifth time that I use the photo ink cartridge a few times and then the printer says it has failed. At roughly $30 a piece, this gets VERY costly! The photo store only charges 29 cents a print. I am learning that this is a much better deal! Very disappointing..."
1,Constant cartridge failure makes this a terrible purchase.,"My old HP Deskjet worked flawlessly for years, but when it wore out I had to decide on a new printer I waited for this one to arrive in the stores. What a waste of time and money! The printer cartridges continually fail and the quality of photographs and color printing is unpredictable at best. I have spent a small fortune on cartridges, all HP brand, no cheap or refilled cartridges, but I feel like a gambler in desparate need of rehab. I will move to another brand once I figure out what direction to go in, this has ended my trust in HP products for the forseeable future."
4,my first bread box,Just got the Kamenstein Natural Hardwood Rolltop bread box for Christmas. It looks good. Very modern. It sticks just a bit when I go to roll it up... but not much and that might be because it's new. It makes my kitchen look more organized than the way I had it with bread piled in a basket. The summer will tell whether it works. Will the bread get moldy when it's hot? Stay tuned for further review.
4,Keeps bread crumbs off the counter :),"You can keep two small loaves or one large sliced loaf of bread in this bread box. If you freeze bread and then let it thaw in the bread box, that is not a good idea! What you will have is moist, moldy bread. Lesson learned at our house. It is perfect for keeping fresh bread fresh!It is also handy for keeping the kitchen phone out of the way. Ours fits on top and then a little box of tea sits up on the top as well. It has a nice roll top, but don't try to put bottles of vitamins, etc. in this. We couldn't get ours open since the bottles moved to the back of the box and then the lid wouldn't roll back. Just in case you were thinking of using it for something else!~The Rebecca Review"
2,Not What I expected,I was disappointed in this bread box. I paid full price for it (24.99) and it arrived broken. The roll part seemed flimsy to me and it didn't roll well at all. I returned it.
3,"standard issue, but i want a BIGGER breadbox!","This is a fine product that does the minimal it is supposed to,but like most, it doesn't hold very much product! We usually have a loaf of bread (or two half-loaves), a package of rolls,and a stack of tortillas, all of which should be able to find a home in the breadbox. Alas, two of these items are usuallysitting on top of the breadbox which is stuffed. I WANT A BIGGER BREADBOX!"
1,Horrid,this game horrible don't waste your time utter mess play MGS or atleast Syphon Filter 1 2 or 3 anything but this horrid game
1,"I think DX said it the best this game could ""(...) it!""","This game (...)! I wasted [my money]...! How can In Cold Blood be UK's #1 seller on PS for 3 months in a row!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought it was good so I brought it. After playing the first 30 min. I thought to my self....maybe I should have brought Mary Kate and Ashely Adventures!!! Yes I'm a guy but that dosen't mean that I can't play Mary Kate and Ashley. If you feel stupid then buy this game. Or you can buy it and waste your time and think to yourself ""(...)Mary Kate and Ashley was on sale too!"""
3,Disappointing.,"Marisa Hancock, a property and land grants attorney from Maine, is brought in at the last minute to represent the federal government seeking to take land from the Seminole Indians, land containing ancient graves. Jackson Bluewolf, Blackfoot founder of Natives for Nature, is in Florida as a consultant for the Seminoles. Marisa's whole life is the law, she never expected to fall in love with Jack. But when the Indian Affairs representative is caught trying to bribe the opposition lawyer, he claims Marisa was behind it, angering Jack who is convinced she was using him.An interesting premise, Indian rights and heritage vs. government desires, is lost in the romance. Unfortunately, the romance is also flawed by Jack's actions after the bribery attempt. Jack pushes the relationship, yet doesn't trust whites or ""suits"". Marisa is both. The set-up is shaky. And where is there a Blackfoot reservation in Oklahoma?"
1,Go to a hardware store,"Somebody must be out of their mind to buy this button-battery for the asking price and pay S&H; to boot!Take a trip to your next hardware store, major drug-store, or such.TJ Huber"
1,Shipping is outrageous,"$9 shipping for a $0.52 battery. Crazy. It's for my boss & it's his money, but if it were me paying I would've gone to the hardware store."
2,CR2032 Battery,"I purchased this item because it was supposed to be a ""Maxell"" battery. When I received it, it was not Maxell. It's a brand I have never seen or heard of."
3,Shipping and Handling High,You can call it outrageous or handy. 5 batteries come to approx $2.68 shipped. You'll need to know your usage on this battery to make it worth while with this suppliers shipping and handling charges.
1,Check Ebay First,"25 of these for $9.99, shipped. They MIGHT be knockoffs, but even if they only last 1/10th as long as ""real"" ones, you break even. Seller has 99.9% positives, with 35,000 feedbacks."
5,Life Of Brian,"Well, it's a book and it has words in it and some pictures of stuff and it's er...quite good. Actually this is a very good combination of script/behind-the-scenes and the usual surreal humour of the Pythons. Plus there is a full frontal nude page, where I swear you can see everything...."
2,Bossa Nova NO-NO!,"As a massive Astrud fan I was attracted by the number of titles on this collection that I'd not previously heard - on the first listen I realised why they'd escaped my attention for so long. A few of the tracks are hallmark Astrud, a few are 'bad' Astrud and a few are just awful in every way. Even the sleeve notes refer to several of the tracks very negatively which begs the question - what is the point? Astrud had moments of sheer genius, some points of popular appeal and some moments of absolute dodginess - unfortunately if you listened to this album your impression of AG would be a second rate, cover version crooner. Avoid this recording and stick to The Silver Collection or the awesome Verve Jazz Masters CD to hear Astrud Gilberto's inadvertent genius in all it's glory."
3,Cover version crooner? Yes. But she's a classy one...,"If you're attuned to her approach to jazz as a bossa nova-lite/ pop-hybrid, no Astrud Gilberto CD can be all bad. These songs are all available elsewhere(and since the CD booklet here has nothing much to offer, you might want to stick with the actual albums), but her version of ""Holiday"" really IS jazzy and the opener ""Beginnings"" is fabulously funky. She's dreamy and intimate when she has to be, but Astrud also swings surprisingly well and this compilation captures a piece of that excitement. 'B'"
4,Angel: a soundtrack of the movie,The CD is lovely. Wish it was more in concert format since waiting for each track is a bit distracting. But it is still a wonderful hour-long interlude. I am curious about the composer who is quite unknown to me. There is little information about him available.
3,Product must have changed.,"I ordered this item because I already have two and was very pleased, but the item that I received was different. It had no accessory hooks but had the same item number - 5E04. The supplier (Pro Max) was very nice about it but had no explanation as to why the product is not the same as advertised except that Rubbermaid must have changed the item. The lack of accessory hooks demotes this item from a 5 star to an ordinary hanger."
4,"Yes, product has changed","Yes, I bought this at a big box, it no longer has the accessory hooks. Just the big curved hooks."
2,Disappointing,"I am a Duke grad, so my love of Duke hoops and Coach K are unmitigated. However, his books, as much as I'd like to feel otherwise, are not good. If they didn't deal directly with glorious Duke basketball, I don't think I could have finished them.This book offers the occasional fresh story or insight; mostly it is predictable and repetitive--just the qualities which K and his clubs avoid consistently.The brillliance of Coach K and his Duke teams are far better enjoyed while watching them play. His talent for motivation, and his exemplary example are better displayed on the court as well."
4,For Duke Fans Only,"As an avid Duke fan, the book was quite enjoyable and fun to read. Even folks that have read virtually every Duke article during last season's championship run will find a substantial amount of ""new"" material, i.e, Coach K's ""conversation"" with Nate James prior to the Final Four trip. Coach K's constant reference to the ""fist"" gets a little tiresome after a while but he truly believes in the concept and his success is indisputable."
2,Go Duke!,Kind of sappy writing but it was great fun to follow the 2001 year and hear some of Coach K's strategies and his take on each of the players. He described each game from that year and that was fun for me because I remember almost all of them.
2,Is there some reason for all the italics?,"I guess I'd ask Donald T. Phillips, Coach K's assisting writer, that question. I guess he thought Duke fans reading the book were too stupid to understand when someone other than Coach K was talking. Or Coach K was too stupid.Anyway, the book is an average recount of Duke's national title season in 2000-2001. It goes start to finish. You'll like it if you're a Duke fan, you won't if you're not."
1,Duke Cheated,"Why buy this book, everyone knows that Duke paid the officials in the Maryland game and the Arizona game. The real story should be how the nation was cheated out of the real championship game Maryland v. Arizona."
1,Skip it...,"Honestly, it's just a bunch of blather about how supereme Duke is and how despite everyone being injured the team overcomes impossible odds to win the title. Honestly, I don't recall this team being all that injury ridden. If you're a Duke fan, buy it. Everyone else, don't bother."
1,duke Cheats,"I am sorry to admit this book is a fake. The national championship is a Fake also. dook cheated and still cheats to this day. In our team meetings we voted on a team mvp - The Officials. Thanks guys. Thanks Hess, Edsell and the rest of you guys."
5,Works great!,"I'm female, not at all handy with tools, but like to take care of small things myself without bothering busy family. For some unknown reason, my toilet gets blocked at least once a month. I've tried chemicals like Drano before with no results and always worry about the effects on the plumbing. This time all the plunging, etc., didn't work. I noticed One Second Plumber and decided to try it. I pressed the device once and wham! The toilet cleared at once! The house is 20 years old and I don't know what the condition of its pipes are. But this did not damage them in the slightest and worked instantly. Try it. It's cheap and effective."
4,choicescmw,"Cynthia Wright aka Devon Lindsay (who by the way is the name of heroine in ""Silver Storm"") writes another truly enjoyable book. I didn't want to put it down, nor did I want the story to end. I'm drawn to books with strong feminine leading characters and smart, take charge men. The men have to exude confidence and manliness. This story met all those requirements and more. I will have to admit that Courtney was a bit unconventional for her time which may have not made her believable. She knew what she wanted and had no qualms about going after it no matter the consequences. Without giving away the story, you will see Courtney exhibit this trait numerous time and I believed that's what endeared her to Damon. This is a good read!!"
3,Boomer Before The Wild Days,"Can't we all remember Boomer from his books and not his later years after fame departed? We love the cute doggie in these books but can we erase the knowledge of his fall from the spotlight? Wasn't there his messy divorce from Lassie, his time at Betty Ford, the ""biting"" incident with the cameraman, those two loose pooches and the webcam in Vegas? But before all that did or did not come to pass, we all fell in love with a slaphappy golden retreiver and this tale of him going to school is the best of the lot.Boomer, we're rooting for your comeback, dude."
4,"""Sister"" is inspirational","My husband and I rented ""Sister Act"" after viewing it on TV one afternoon. We were especially impressed with the way Goldberg's character transformed a dissonant choir in a very traditional church setting into an energized and creative choir which succeeded in drawing people in from the streets and eventually transforming the haughty Mother Superior (Maggie Smith)into a ""believer"" in the power of her church's upbeat musical repertoir. We even used a short clip from the film to show to committee members from our own traditional church, in the attempt to illustrate the necessity of contemporizing our churchservice and music. It made for a very spirited meeting of our committee. Everyone seemed to enjoy it."
5,Classic Whoopi,"Purchased this movie along with Sister Act 2 just because these are probably my favorite Whoopi movies. Both are funny, and I love the musical numbers. The ""nuns"" and the kids in 2 are great. Just enjoyable, feel good movies!"
4,"Funny, Entertaining, Cool",Defidently a fun-filled movie. Delores hides out in a church from her husband who is a member of the Mafia and wants to kill her. She ends up directin the awful sounding chior. She makes that horrible chior turn into one of the best chiors I've ever heared!
5,SISTER ACT,"This 1992 is one of the best comedy movies ever! Ever! You can never get tired of Whoopi Goldberg as Las Vegas lounge singer, Delories Van Cartier who becomes Sister Mary Clarence. Deloris witnesses a murder by her married boyfriend (played by Harvey Kietel) and under Reno police orders, she hides out in a covent in san Francisco, California. While there, she goes by the name, Sister Mary Clarence and learns how to adjust to life as a nun and also uses her Las Vegas lounge singing experience to teach her follow nuns in the chior how to sing together as a group.I loved this movie from beginning to end and is my No. #1 comedy movie of all-time! The center square from the Tom Bergeron-hosted game show, Hollywood Squares (1998-2002) was absolutely hilarious here and so was the whole movie! You will love ""SISTER ACT""! Kathy Najimy, Maggie Smith and Mary Wickes also star."
5,Absolutely hilarious! A great movie!,"To me, this movie was an unexpected gem. I didn't think that I would like it, but after seeing it, how could I not? The script was well-written and full of subtle humour. My favourite scene is when Whoopi and the sisters are talking about ""getting the call"". I still laugh at that! The music is really upbeat and fun,too. Who would have thought they could make everyday pop tunes into church songs? All in all, a definite must-see! You will laugh out loud!"
3,Not what it could have been.,"The idea of Goldberg's character posing as someone she's not, is a very overused one by now (""Ghost"", The Associate"", etc.) This movie takes an o.k. premise, but eventually gets too much tangled up in song & dance. -And that's where the problem lies; this couldn't happen in real life, there's nothing for her to do there, so the filmmakers clearly went the ""clever"" way (read: easy), and had Whoopi do her stuff. If they'd skipped all the musical acts, and gone for a more serious approach, they might have had an interesting film. There is a plus, however: the brilliant Joseph Maher is marvellous as always. -His role should've been bigger, but he's a favorite actor of mine, so the movie scores with me because of him."
1,You Can't Ban Me is wrong,"This is a classic disgrace of a movie by Whoopi Goldberg, one of the suckiest actreses of our time. Much to the previous reviewer's chagrin, people who dislike her know real talent like Chris Rock, Richard Pryor, Sam Kinison(so we are not racists). It was RIGHT of Slim Fast to dump the greedy tyrant Goldberg from their ads after she made some candid remarks about the president. Anyway, this film is a masterpiece of garbage. I have zilch respect for Whoopi and despise everything she does."
4,C'mon guys theyRe fun,GWTW they aren't but there is some fabulous music in both. I don't think that they were meant to be serious. I think I actually liked the 2 better.SA2 made me cry when they won. These are just great movies and a way to lift your spirits
2,Shepard Faiery,Shepard Fiarey isn't a artist but a egotistical a@@h@@e! He thinks because he got lucky and picked the first black President is the only reason his art is worth what it is! He is now going to jail for everything he has said about everything since that print came out! He lied to the courts in a Civil case that was all because he didn't want to admit he took someone elses picture scanned it and made millions off it! So now that it was found out that he is fake and we were email friends and I asked him when and if he knew the he lied to the coutrts he defriended me and I found out everything he does is fake and to make money and he could careless about his values unless there is a $ sign behind it!
1,Not worth it,"First off, this camera is not made in the USA as indicated online. Creates poor choppy and grainy video.I would not recomend this camera, spend a little bit more and get good camera with 3x Optical Zoom."
1,I wouldnt recommend this camera,I had this camera for over 3years collecting dust now. The camera takes too long to process the image and save. The flash works but not for close pictures or else bright light will block out our image. You have to hold the camera in a still position for a few seconds after you press the button while the picture saves or else image blurs. I dont like this camera.
2,Please dont purchase this Camera DC DXG-308 3MP,"in December 25 2004 buys this camera and today 07 of Septemberthe cam is garbage, dont turn on, I have watched everythingthe battery, please dont purchase this cam.please i have one friend that buy an sony cibershot 3.1 megapixeland all going excelent....."
1,bad bad camera,"this camera is pesky. the settings wouldn't save, the flash is off by default.it seriously needs a viewfinder, you can't see anything, even in a very well lit room. the pictures are horrible, and dark, and very very grainy.with the flash, the pictures are really overexposed, and most pictures are worthless. please do not even consider this camera."
2,Save your money,"I don't recommend this camera to anyone. It usually takes terrible pictures and it drinks up battery juice like cheap wiskey. The flash won't work when you need it to and its hard to see the view screen. The zoom is relatively decent; and when you can get it to work right, it can take some okay pictures and video clips, but no one should waste their money on the DXG-308. There are so many great cameras out there, so save up and buy one you'll love. I recomend Cannon or Nikon."
2,save your time and money,the flash washed everything out! outdoors it takes great movie clips and pics but if you are planning to use the flash be prepared to see white or black blocks of nothingness. batteries run out very quickly. i did like the size of it...just wished it worked.
2,Not worth the trouble,"Nice little camera, but it does not take quality pictures. We used this camera for pictures of all kinds and the pictures look great on the camera display, but once they are printed they are very blurry and distorted. Spend the extra money to get something of good quality, this camera is definitely not it."
1,Not flattering,"This is not flattering. It is too short. I ordered this and a size 16. They are both exactly the same length and width! I want to send it back. How do I do that?Thank you,Marie Sunshine"
2,Very disappointing for the price,I expected KitchenAid products to perform at this price point and was sorely disappointed. The blades are not sharp for effective blending. It was designed more for crushing ice which it can't do. The rubberized claw on the motor base developed cracks after crushing ice and moderate use to blend liquids.The jug is not properly shaped to draw the liquid down to the blades and you have to keep scraping the contents and push it down.My mother bought a Braun which works as a good blender should at a lower price. They are not available through Amazon and you have to search the web for vendors.
2,Gave Up After Only 4 Years,"We got this blender for our wedding four years ago. We have used it some, but not what I would call a lot. I mean, we're not making smoothies for breakfast every day or anything! The other day I was using it, and it completely quit working because the mechanism which turns the blades (made out of some kind of rubber?) disintegrated into tiny little pieces--annoying, to say the least. The blender is nice in the beginning, but I wouldn't recommend it for the long term."
3,Coupler Meltdown,"Have the KSB3 model and used it rarely till this past summer when I began making smoothies with ice daily for a couple of months. The coupler on the base of the machine is made of an inferior rubber which gets soft and breaks apart. Upon searching the net for a replacement part I find that this is a very common problem with KA blenders (for several years) and they refuse to send replacement parts but will look at the machine for 35.00 and see what's wrong. I know what's wrong, an inferior part is being used on an expensive appliance. My kids replaced the KA with an Oster blender that has all metal parts for less than half the price of a KA."
2,noise? or not?,"It has taken three blenders to figure out a system that works (maybe). My first blender was returned with a terrible noise in the blade assembly. The second was quiet as a dream but gradually developed the grating noise as well. Warranty replacement was easy but took a long time to receive the new unit. Upon working with both the old unit and the new one, I determined that the noise varies with each assembly. Sometimes works like a dream, sometimes unearthly noise. It seems to be a design flaw in the jar base. Noise can vary by placement on the base. FRUSTRATION. When it works it's great but maybe not worth the hassle. Hard to believe three different blenders would have the same issue."
2,"A crusher, not a blender","If you want an ice crusher - this is it. It can crush ice without any liquid at any speed. However, if you want a smooth texture, this will not do the job. I mainly use blenders for smoothies and to puree soup. Because of the blunt blade and wide bottom - it will not emulsify no matter how long you run it. When I made my smoothie, I ran it longer to see if it would become a creamy consistency (like I would get from my other blender) but it just made the ingredients warm. Another problem is that it doensn't handle single portions well. It splashes all over the jar making it impossible to add ingredients without getting it in your hair and making it necessary to scrape the sides. I returned it and bought a Hamilton Beach MasterBlender for $20 (Bed & Bath) and it's fantastic. No ice chunks, creamy smoothies and silk-like soups."
2,Worked great until....,"Oh yeah, I loved my Kitchenaid blender for it's ice crushing talent. Then one day (horrors!)I used regular sized cubes (not the dainty quarter sized ones), the rubber coupler jammed and broke 3 of its teeth.So, customer service tells me, the closest place that fixes these delicate little thingies is 280 miles away.I want a Waring! But apparently they malfunction with normal cubes too...."
4,Not bad......,"After years of using cheap, department store blenders, we opted for this one. The REAL reason is because Wife wants red appliances in the kitchen, and you can't eaisly get red blenders. Anyway, I find it to be satisfactory. It feels well built, runs quiet, and performs okay. You have to use it a few times to get the right ""feel"" for chopping up fruit and ice. Something I never had to think about with the cheap units. Oh well, it's not bad, but for the price, (even with the rebate) I'd shop around a tad more."
2,Quality not as expected,"Notice that they are also selling a coupling part. I expected Kitchenaid to be of good quality and last a long time, like my mother's stand mixer. I haven't used my blender very much, although I did crush small amounts of ice on its pulse mode. Anyway the coupling unit broke off 4 of its 6 teeth and now I'm afraid to use it. Fortunately they sell the part, but I will have to get someone else to replace it since I have arthritic hands. I bought a Kitchenaid toaster at the same time and it also broke within 2 years of use."
3,Works BUT coupler broke in 2 yrs,This blender is great when its working! the coupler(the rubber thing which spins the blade) started to wear out and now its completely torn and can't run the blades!I called the CS and they say I need to order from a service center which is 100miles away from where I live...My oster blender which I paid $15 is working from 9 years! but this one broke with in 2yrs.
1,Rubber coupling will fail,"The rubber blade on the base which connects with the glass container will fail after several years.Don't waste your money. Find a product with metal parts.With light use, there doesn't seem to be a problem, which was my experience until recently. So do your research!"
2,A workhorse!,"I have had this blender for nearly 2 years and use it for a lot of heavy-duty liquefying and have been very happy with its performance. I have burned out motors of several, cheaper blenders previously under the same kind of use. The fact that you can throw the blade into a dishwasher is something very unique to Kitchenaid I believe and it comes very handy. One problem that is common to all american-made, american-designed blenders is present in the Kitchenaid blender also. The high profile of the blade causes small quantities to get stuck under the blade. Why they couldn't lower the blades I don't know. ...See my updated review (after the blender died on me)."
3,"Looks great, works okay","I bought this blender because I wanted a red blender, but I have to say I'm disappointed by its blending abilities. All I make are fruit smoothies, and no matter how long I run the blender, I still get chunks of fruit that weren't liquified. My cheapie Osterizer blender I used to have pulverized food much better. Oh well, the price I pay for fashion."
1,dissapointed,"the rubber coupling fell apart, literally, and I hardly used this blender. Super disappointed, and from my favorite brand. Not sure which one to buy now as all my other appliances are kitchen aide, and I would prefer they match, but not if they are this poor quality."
1,Lousy blender,"I bought this blender about 7 years ago, and have used it only 100 times or so. While making a milkshake the blender blades stopped working. I called KitchenAid and they told me they no longer carry replacement blades. I spent the big money for KitchenAid to begin with because they stand behind their products, and now I find out they don't. I will never buy KitchenAid again.What kind of blender company would not carry replacement blades?"
3,WOW! I'm Smart!!,"Took the self-test (with all it's familar looking questions) and scored fairly high. Too bad I can't use any of this smarts in real life. (When will I need to know which square diagram, with the small triangle and circle in it, is the right one to complete the sequence of other squares with small triangles and circles?)Maybe a 'thinking' way to spend some extra time, but nothing to make you smarter - or have a higher IQ."
3,The Movie's Better,"Nine times out of ten the book is better than whatever movie they make out of it. This is that one time. This book would have been better 100 pages shorter, leaving out all of the Keith backstory that really wasn't that interesting to start off with. Sure, the Keith character matures over the course of the book; but it was his service on the Caine that made him that better person. The rest was, to me, just filler."
2,-----------------The Caine Mutiny-----------------,"dear readers, this book is considered one of the greatest war classics. in my personal opinion this book was not a good read. the writing style consists mainly of naval talk which can confuse readers such as myself who know SQAUT about the navy. if you r insterested in naval things this book you would probally find nice. but for the average reader like myself i found this book rather long and dull. the characters are well devolped and that part of the book i really enjoyed BUT willie ( the main character's) romance is JUST TOO CORNY..."
5,The fascinating journey of the Caine,"Part exciting WWII story, part romance, part gripping courtroom drama. ""The Caine Mutiny"" is a classic novel that hardly dates a bit despite being published in 1951. Wouk brilliantly explores the tension between the professional navy men and the part-timers during WWII. He appears to stick up for the sometimes strange and arbitrary ways of the long-time navy men but it's not an entirely convincing argument - the reader needs to make up their own mind. Wouk expertly explores the psychology of the main characters, especially the odious Captain Queeg and the cowardly Keefer. The actual ""mutiny"" scene still packs a punch.The book was made into an excellent film starring Humphery Bogart and Van Johnson in 1954 - and it is interesting to compare them. The film captures the essence of the book perfectly despite omitting or changing quite a few key scenes, and the ironic twist surrounding De Vriess puts the film one up on the book."
4,A Book Like A Screenplay,"The Caine Mutiny was an excellent read (that goes by more quickly than its thickness would have you believe). It was exciting and adventuresome. However, parts of it read like it was written directly for the screen. The predictable crescendos and love story lacked the depth that one hopes for from an otherwise great piece of literature. It is definitely a book that commands attention, and perhaps served as an inspiration to the screenplay author of ""A Few Good Men."""
3,Salty and chewy,"I saw the film some two decades ago, and I heard Bogart's voice every time Queeg opened his mouth. But this book is less like the film and more like the summarization of war (and my job in flight control at the airport)--long periods of leisurely description punctuated by brief explosions of action. Characters developed, their depths were plumbed, and then they transferred or got killed or were sent home.There's a long gentle arc to the story, for the most part, and the book is about Willie Keith's trajectory. I sometimes found myself tempted to flip ahead to see if anything started happening, but this was a well written book and if nothing else I know a lot more about the USN in WWII."
3,Three Quarters Great and Then a Fumble,"I know I should proceed at great caution in reviewing a classic or a near classic. And, I suppose, I shouldn't say anything bad about this book and much less use a crude football analogy to describe it. But... I do feel it is my duty to warn anyone else out there looking for a sure fire no risk classic like I was.That in my opinion. This book isn't it. The Author, not matter how great I'm sure he is, seems to have deserted the wonderful characters he creates to make a few points and create some Danille Steel twists that are pretty hard to believe. After all the Captain was absolutely crazy.Go buy the Red Badge of Courage"
1,Disgusted!,"I bought the Maxell ""Color CD-R Music"" discs in 20-packs (PN: 034267-01/MDM), on sale, at a national drugstore chain. I bought them for copying voice and music from radio and audio cassettes, using a Sony RCDW500C CD recorder, which requires music disks. I had been using TDK Music CD-RWs, which have worked perfectly every time. The Maxell discs failed every time. The first 15-20 minutes on the disc seem all right, then the sound becomes muddled and distorted, sometime crashing entirely. I went back to the TDK discs, then copied them onto the Maxell discs using my PC. This seemed to work okay--but no better than much cheaper data CDs. I would not recommend the Maxell music discs for recorders requiring the music discs."
5,hottt,"i too have been listening to this non-stop. erudite and base, sincere and wry, its a masterpiece, really."
3,Whats up with this?,"This book is great but what's up with the spelling? All the ""th"" words start with ""m"" so that looks like mat and then looks like men. Seriously amazon, what's up with that?"
1,this item sucks,"This is the worst money I've ever spent,it lasted about 2 weeks and it broke. I bought one 2 years ago and it was wouking fine untill somebody took it off of my truck but by that time the light still worked but it stopped moving up and down. If this is the best they can do the need to re-think manufacturing.I would realy like to get my money back.Terry"
2,Too Many Repairs,"We had three of these installed 9 years ago (2001). I would not buy them again.They all start leaking (through the shower head) every 4-5 years. You then have to refurbish or replace the two internal stop valves. The manual shows how, but it's time consuming, and too involved for most homeowners. Requires socket wrenches. About 10 parts are removed before you get to the stop valves.The stop valves are $150 a pair, but Grohe will send them for free under the lifetime warranty, Or you may just need new O-rings (special metric sizes, not available in any US hardware store).Pro's:- Thermostat: Set it and forget it- Seems like very high quality components inside and out- Good lifetime parts warranty (Save your receipt!)Cons:- The stop valves need servicing every 4-5 years- Self-servicing is tricky. Plumbers are expensive.Once you install an in-wall shower valve it's very expensive to cut your losses and change to a different model."
1,"Audible to humans, pets, etc.","This might actually work, but it sent me out of the room with the constant noise. In a warehouse where no one is working, or a an abandoned garage, or on a planet with no humans, this might be ideal. It also ""doesn't work through walls"" according to the manual. Eeek."
3,SiPix Pocket Printer A6,"Disappointed in print speed, painfully slow over Infrared from Treo 700p Smartphone.Unit had AC adapter with European plug.Appears to have been on the shelf a long time."
3,"portable printer,thermal printing","Not a bad little product for portable use, the thermal printing is an added feature if you are packing light.Can use roll or sheet paper. easily purchased."
3,Not Sure,"I really am not sure if this product works because my dog would not let me apply it on his nose, Everytime tried he would lick it off."
3,CLARIFICATION BY AUTHOR,"I was quite surprised to find this obscure comic book show up in my amazon.com listing. I hasten to clarify that what I wrote was a comic book adapation of this classic fantasy/sf story by wonderful authors, LEIGH BRACKETT and RAY BRADBURY.The art was by Dell Barras.I've never actually seen copies of the thing myself, so I have no idea how it came out, but they still want me to rate it."
5,WIsdom of the Gemstone Guardians,"Fascinating book of how the founder of Gemisphere therapeutic gemstones gained more knowlegde of this type of therapy. The text flows well and the reader is drawn to the next page like a ""cant'put it down"" crime novel. I would have liked to have illustrations along with the different chapters, because the types of places and beings in this book are prpbably new to most people."
2,Not What I Anticipated,"I am not into the magical and mystical powers of gemstones. From the review I read, I was prepared for a book naming and showing all types of gems along with some beliefs and meanings of color and gemstones for my jewelry designs. I would not recommend unless you are interested in Wicca and forms of mysticism and magic."
2,..But I could put it down.,"How can someone write such a book without beautiful, colorful photos depicting the gemstones mentioned? This one just doesn't speak to me."
2,Disappointing,"This author has something to sell. I work with crystals for all kinds of purposes and they most certainly are not all spherical and gem-perfect as required of the ""Gem***** Guardians""...not sure if I can write the entire name, (hence the *****), because this term is trademarked by the author. Cha-Ching. Please Mr. Katz, lend some credibility to true healing and the New Age Movement and leave out the flowing gowns, long beards, & mist!"
1,Stop carrying this book!,"This book encourages parents to abuse their children to make them into robots who, if they survive, will in turn, abuse their children. Amazon-we are not buying anything from you anymore until you remove this disgusting title and all others promoting any kind of abuse of children, elderly or anyone. What were you thinking?"
4,Kipper's Snowy Day,"I enjoyed this book very much. This book reminded me of all the fun times my friends and I had when we were younger. I liked this book also, because of the things that Kipper, and Tiger do together, they make their own fun. Even though Tiger dos not like the silly woolly snow suit, they make it funny. I liked when they were rolling down the hill, then how they used all the snow to make a dog.Kipper and Tiger will always find ways to have fun. This great variety of books as well as the television series, and movies that have been made, Kipper is vey popular. I would recommend this book for children ages 2-8, because I think anyone can enjoy this book."
5,I love this CD,"I bought this just for one song: Sognami. But all the cd is intensive, specially ""Viky Love"" song. This is no a very romantic cd, his voice is not that soft but is sparkling!!!"
2,Craters,"Duncan Steel is one of the best known advocates for a near Earth observation system, and he and others like him should be listened to. Unfortunately the book is not too great. It didn't hold my attention, partly because of the intrusion of some of his opinions. If nothing else is available on the topic, this could be an okay choice. See instead ""Rain of Iron and Ice"" by John S. LewisRelated titles include ""Night Comes to the Cretaceous"" by James Lawrence Powell and ""T Rex and the Crater of Doom"" by Walter Alvarez."
5,Great concept & works well,"This item works like a charm! I really like that I do not have to lift my wheelbarrow to hang it up on a wall, literally, all you need to do is get your wheelbarrow close to the hook and then start tilting the handles up to get the front lip seated in the bottom hook then continue to tilt up until the top hook can latch onto the wheelbarrow. This easily holds my 6 cubic foot steel wheelbarrow (the max load for the hook is 50 lbs). I LOVE this hook and the whole fasttrack system. This hook is hard to find which may indicate it is being discontinued but that's my own thought - I have not seen anything in writing saying it will be discontinued. Let's hope not!!"
4,Some Goodies from George Benson,"This is a great sampling of early George Benson. Some of the songs here are from his early album ""Goodies,"" which is no longer available. If you like early George, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one."
3,Carpool Review,"It's a fun movie . . . pretty slap stick, but I just wanted it for the grandkids and to watch once a year."
4,"Great Movie, Bad Case","This is a really great, funny movie. My only disappointment is the case it comes in and the region code doesn't match my DVD in Australia. Not sure if this is spolier or not but I especially like the part where they paint the car pink :)"
2,Carpool Is A Decent Entertainer,"ON THE WHOLE CARPOOL IS A DECENT ENTERTAINER. THE FILM ISN'T HALIROUS BUT IT IS FUNNY. THE FILM ISN'T BORING AT ALL. A ONE TIME WATCHER.TOM ARONLOD IS GOOD,YET AGAIN.DAVID PAYMER IS EXCELENT. HE STEALS THE SHOW."
2,Fun for a While but Deflates Toward the End,"We thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this movie and had a lot of laughs. Tom Arnold makes a convincing ""good"" bad guy, and the kids help the plot along with the grumpy dad. The movie loses steam when the car chase ends and they end up in Tom Arnold's carnival, and then to the dad's executive meeting. To be honest, I gave up on the movie at that point and let the boys play the X-box, as my interest was completely lost."
3,a good movie for a family,"the movie is exceptable,i liked it and my little sister likes to watch it.the kids in the car were so cute and funny except for rachel leigh cook,she is so boring and a bad actress,she should get more training to be a good actress.the 3 stars were for the kids in this movie."
2,Morally problematic,"I thought the movie was funny, enjoyable & well-made. The performances were good especially Tom Arnold & Rhea Pearlman. The problem I had was with the moral problems of the script. Especially the point in the mall, here the father & children are free from being hostages (albeit from a harmless Arnold). At that point, they actually help in the escape of Arnold who, however sympathetic, has comitted a criminal act. So they are then guilty of aiding & abetting a criminal. I know that this didn't bother anyone else reviewing this, nor am I a moralist. But it seemed quite wrong, especially in a family film. The ending somewhat abets this by having Arnold give back the money & perform community service. But I don't see how in a film you can encourage aiding & abetting a criminal. Liking him, being sympathetic & compassionate to him, forgiving him, yes. Helping him crossed a line that shouldn't have been crossed."
2,9th Grade Errors and Rambling,"I sincerely hope that no one edited this book. There were junior high errors such as confusion between ""your"" and ""you're,"" ""wear"" and ""where,"" and so on. There were random commas, commma splices, and run ons. The worst part, however, is that the train of thought was not constant and the book sounded more like the poorly-written journal of a twelve-year-old. The tips were so specific to one airline and so masked in the thoughts of the author that they were of little help."
2,Stapled Out!,Worked beautifully for 1/2 of a bar of staples. Neither my husband nor I could get it to do more. Nice finish but it finished too quick!
2,Need quality control,"I have 2 of these rapid staplers for over 14years. each one average 100-150 uses per day. they finally start to giving out, so i order 2 more for replacement. only two month in to use both stapler's molding plate start to braking apart, now i have two useless stapler. very very disappointed."
5,Great heavy duty stapler for my art studio,"I searched locally in store at staples, office depot, walmart, etc. Then I searched online for this style of stapler. I did a little researching and came to the conclusion that this was the most popular brand and best reviewed. After receiving the stapler I'm very satisfied Roth the sturdy construction and feel of this stapler. All metal parts,no plastic components. I was surprised to see this stapler used both standard and longer staples. Great stapler, solid construction, exactly what I wanted for my art studio/workshop."
3,Not For Me,"I didn't expect this coffee maker to be as bad as it is. I bought it because I loved the color and thought it would hide coffee stains. It is the most basic coffee maker available - so if you are used to a few features, this will seem like a toy.Main complaints are that it keeps brewing coffee when you pull the pot out to grab that first cup (takes a while to brew - so sit tight and take a little pre-caffine snooze), and if you don't drink all the coffee it makes ( about 1 1/2 mugs full, four ""teacups"" full) right away, it ""cooks"" the coffee and makes it bitter.I wish I had bought a bigger, better product.It still does look very cute and blue on the kitchen counter, however, and it does make coffee."
3,Dribbling is right. . .,"If you prefer coffee made the ""drip"" method, you'll be happy considering that if you grab the carafe and pour a cup in the ""normal"" manner, it is virtually impossible not to DRIP coffee all over the place! If you pour it slowly, there is no problem. (but who always pours coffee slowly at 6 in the morning?) Since I've never had this problem with any other coffee maker I consider it a major blunder on the part of KitchenAid....this product could not have been tested without this being a noticeable problem & their opting to sell it anyway is a big mark against a company that ought to know better. I would not buy one again unless I was assured this problem were corrected."
1,Death By A Thousand Dribbles,"My wife says the dribble problem is a man thing. I say, if you like licking coffee off your hand, then buy this baby because the FRIGGIN THING SPIILS EVERYTIME YOU GO TO POUR COFFEE. Trust me, you may as well place the appliance in your sink when in use."
3,SOLD.... to the highest bidder... bye bye dribble,"I bought this because of the conveient size & color choices ( I bought blue) but another reviewer put it in the best words, about the LEAKS,,, ongoing NOISES after brewing is over,,, GRINDS in the coffee,,, and most of all DRIBBLE everywhere... its been 2 years... I sold it to the highest bidder & got double what I paid in the 1st place... I really wanted to like the machine :("
2,Brewmaster for hire...,"Dig it. All I want is a reliable machine to provide my necessary cup of joe in the morning. Is that too much to ask? I purchased this KitchenAid expecting just the basics of coffee production. What I got was a gurgling, leaking, malfunctioning hunk of crap. Besides that, my coffee came out bitter and lukewarm."
4,French Vanilla Creme better than Vanilla Ice Cream,"I started out drinking Muscle Milk Light Vanilla Creme. I really liked the taste, but didn't want all of the ""extra"" ingredients they include. I just wanted plain protein.After reading reviews of Optimal Nutrition (ON), I gave the ON vanilla ice cream a try. I mixed it in milk, and there was very little added taste to the milk. It tasted like I was drinking plain milk.I gave French Vanilla Creme a try next, and found that it has a little more vanilla flavor. I prefer it over the ON vanilla ice cream. However, still not as good of a flavor as the Muscle Milk.With my weight training, the ON protein has helped me to add lean muscle. Plus, I don't find myself hungry later, and end up eating all kinds of junk.By the way, the cost per serving is less with the ON. So, that's what I'm sticking with for now."
4,Meh.,"This is okay.. I guess. One thing that i don't really like about this product which i actually got a day before expected (kudos)is that it doesn't mix well with milk, other than that it tastes pretty good (i purchased the Double rich Chocolate) which tastes like Nesquick"
5,"Great Taste, Better Value!","I've tried my fair share of protein supplements, and ON's Gold Standard 100% Whey is the best by far. Not only does it supply you with high quality protein, it mixes better, tastes better (I prefer chocolate), rinses easier, and has better value than any other protein shake I've tried to date. A+ for quality and cost."
5,Great Value,"I've been taking this protien on and off for about 5 years and still to this date have not found any whey protien that beats the value. You will find some other powders out there that will taste better, but if you experiment with the amount of water or milk you mix with this, i'm sure you can find a taste you like. My goal for whey protien in a day is about 100 grams on training days. I train 5 days a week and this bag lasts me 2 months. So if you are on a budget, this is the best value out there."
4,Tastes good but not versatile like other flavors,"ON products are always reliable. That said, this tastes pretty good when mixed with just water. I love mint chocolate chip ice cream so the mint taste wasn't over bearing or too minty at all. I took one star off BC it was difficult for me to mix it with other components like fruit with this flavor opposed to what I typically drink which is the extreme chocolate flavor. Also, I got used to the taste and couldn't bare any longer BC of my inability to find good mixes that are low in calorie while tasting great."
5,:D,"This is by far the best Protein out there! Also some of the purest! the taste is amazing even thought that's not their main focus! the protein to carb ratio is amazing! also for the price you get a lot more serving than you do with other companies! Ive had the chocolate, vanilla, cake batter, banana, french vanilla! and they are all pretty good! I loved the cake batter, but the chocolate I could make really good shakes out of it! I also seen a lot more gains when adding this to my daily workout/cardio! Like it says on the tub you must consume you body weight/more in protein threw quality proteins spread out threw the day to gain maximum gains ha! I would definitely buy this/recommend it!"
4,100 0/0 whey gold,Best protein drink I have ever had!A little to spendy????Was $39 now $59??????Can i get a better deal next time I make a purchase????
3,"Good Taste, Mixes Well, Poor Protein Content","This is a great product as far as 'style' goes, however it's not entirely gold standard, nor 100% whey.The Amazon page comments on how it is 'Packed with whey protein isolates'. This isn't the case, it's a combination of isolate and concentrate and has a total protein content of only 75%.I usually use an isolate with an over 90% protein content, I'm currently using a 95% isolate. It's not acceptable to me to have a 'gold standard' whey 'packed' with isolate that is as high in cholesterol, etc as this product.That said it mixes superbly and tastes great with milk or water, but I'm not using it again. I used it as I was in the USA on business, I will stick to my specialist retailer's product, which is pure isolate, lower in cholesterol and lower in carbs.It would be good if Amazon could mention that the serving size is a 32g scoop, it'd put the 24g of protein per serving into perspective."
4,Good product,"mixes great compared to cheaper brands, I just use cold water in a shaker and I never have any problems with chunks. taste is also decent."
3,"Great product, not so great taste","Have been using on whey for a while, usually the double chocolate. Decided to change it up and get the chocolate mint because i love mint chocolate chip ice cream. This taste more like light chocolate with a slight after taste of mint, not good at all. Would recommend this product , but in a different flavor."
5,Tasty and mxes well,"I liked this, it mixed easy in a small blender (bullet) and the taste was chocolaty. I only mixed it with skim milk so I don't know how it mixes with water."
5,Best whey yet.,"Bought some of this to see if it mixes better than previous brands. I'm happy to say it mixes very well in milk, a few stirs with a spoon mixes almost all of it completely. Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is very good, even my two year old grand daughter loves it. Safe bet."
2,Bad Taste For Strawberry - Will not product again,"The product that I brought was ""Delicious Strawberry"" and it did not taste good or smell good at all with water.But seems to blend right with milk. But I strongly don't recommend you buying the strawberry flavor, cause it taste like some rubber and it smells horrible. Your best bet would be reviewing other flavors or perhaps start with muscle milk which I previously enjoyed and will continue to use it instead of this product."
4,Better than most!,"I have tried numerous protein drinks, either owning or tasting from friends. I must say this is definitely one of the better tasting ones. However, I would not recommend it with water. It tastes more natural with milk and is more tolerable to even the most picky person. I would probably recommend this flavor over any of the other Gold Standard products. The only downside is that this product apparently uses artificial sweeteners, which have been known to cause health products in the long term. Hope this was helpful!"
2,"Ours was lumpy, ok once removed",It was OK after removing the lumps in the bag harder chocolate lumps we were not sure of so rather then take a chance we took them out of the product. It seems OK but could not get response on product from maker if we should be concern or not. They are rated well on bodybuilders dot com etc. Maybe got a bag exposed to moisture is all we can assume since we got no response other wise to date
4,Tastes Good,"I've been taking this stuff for approximately a week. It does help me meet my protein intake goal and it tastes pretty decent.I don't like milk so I drink it with a small bottle of blue Gatorade followed by a glass of water. If you want to just mix this with water...be warned. It does not taste very good in water.Again, with some gatorade this is very drinkable."
3,Good product bad service,"I've used this product for over 6 months now but this is my first time buying a 10lb bag. The 3 star rating is there because of amazon's slow shipping. It said ""shipping soon"" for 5 days now and so I'm pretty sure T'm going to get this item in a week. This is a big step back as opposed to my previous experience with amazon, which my product came in a total of 3 days."
1,Warning: contains Acesulfame,"I had to throw this out when I discovered a poorly tested artificial sweetener named Acesulfame. Acesulfame may stimulate insulin secretion aggravating low blood sugar attacks. Acesulfame produced tumors, leukemia, and respiratory disease in several rodent studies according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest,"
1,Bad protein,"when I received the protein, it seems it was a used one, it was covered with dust and the box is damaged, when I open it, the film was half opened. seems like a returned one. and the effect is bad, incomparable to other products I used before, takes me more days to recovery. BAD!"
2,is it only me or any1 else,"hey guysi bought this product after looking at the reviews. i had this after my workout past one week, and i am getting terrible unease in my stomach. is this specific to me or any1 else have faced this? also i want to know if we need to drink more water on a daily basis,when we consume whey"
1,Dont buy strawberry flavor,"this product tasted horrible (strawberry flavor) i did my research online and it said that O.N was one if not the best protein shake out there, so i went from dymatize elite fusion 7 to O.N and i regret it so now im back to ELITE FUSION 7 great price and the BEST FLAVOR OUT"
3,This protein powder has artificial sweeteners,"I ordered this protein powder due to the great reviews and it seemed like what I needed. I ordered the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor. I had no idea, however, that this product has artificial sweeteners. The first time I tried this product, I could taste the artificial sweeteners immediately. The ""fake"" taste and the way I felt after drinking it makes me regret buying this product. Quite a disappointment."
4,Good for the balance I need,"Hi this stuff is good to balance my protein intake. It's low on carb, fat and sodium. Watch the cholesterol though. I don't use it everyday but probably 75%. It can taste a bit chalky and metallic. I use it with water mostly and I whip it with an aerolatte (coffee frother). I find the taste is better with really cold water. It can also be made with a shaker. Most people make a shake with added frozen fruit and any kind of milk. I don't like to drag out the blender."
3,good,"This protein is pretty good. The choclate tastes good, fairly few calories and 24 grams or close of protein. I consider it decent mid grade protein. good bang for your buck."
5,Good Deal,"Protein is expensive, and this is the first time I've bought in bulk. I don't regret it, as it didn't cost much more than a 5lb jug at GNC but will last twice as long."
4,great product,"I am never disappointed by optimum nutrition products, and their protein is always a great buy at a great price."
4,good quality protein source,The taste was not bad when I mixed it with coffee. The quality of the protein seemed good and carried me through much as a light breakfast would.
5,Great product,"This is the first time I've tried this product, and it is excellent. I especially like the solubility of the mix in milk, soymilk, and water."
4,Great source of protein,I thought that the price was reasonable and it was a great source of protein. The flavor is iffy but it does the job. I will probably try some other brands too and might end up back at this one again.
5,Do NOT use hot water!,"Just got this a day ago. So far so good, but a word of advice: NEVER MIX WITH HOT WATER!!! And by hot I mean boiling or close to boiling temperature. Instead of dissolving, it congeals and forms chunks of flotsam that have a meat-like texture. Needless to say you don't want to eat that. But lukewarm water seems to work fine. I don't know if all whey powder behaves like this, but in either case I won't do that again."
3,Great Protien Way too sweet!,"Good flavor, but way way too sweet, do you people even bother to taste this stuff? Great Whey Protien, but I will stay with the basic flavors, every time I try one of your new flavors I am disappointed."
3,Good protein,OM makes good protien dont get me wrong however strawberry is not the flavor for me. This one seems to have a nasty after-taste.
5,DELICIOUS,Love love love this protein powder. It's delicious and mixes well. Optimum nutrition is my favorite!!! Mixes GREAT in oatmeal!!!! Soo yummy!
5,Its The Best!,"This product is great! I bought the strawberry flavor, and it tastes great! Amazon delivered it really quick. This brand of whey protein is a lot better than any other brands out there. In my opinion, this product works the best for me, but I think some people may prefer others. This product is affordable, it's not very cheap or very expensive. If you are a serious weight lifter, I would recommend buying a bigger package, and save more money."
4,Cake batter 5 Pound,The cake batter is awesome. My only grip is that i had to buy a 5 pd bucket to get it. I get tired of protein quick so i usually keep 3 flavors around at once to change up. Make the cake batter a permanent flavor and sell it in a 2pd jug please.
4,Not Chalky but not really Cookie Flavor,First I wanna say that the reason i picked this brand was because it has won awards for best protein supplement product and because it was very popular on amazons most purchased list. I am reviewing the Cookies and Cream flavor and if i blind tasted this product i would not be able to guess and flavor. The flavor isnt so much cookies and cream but a sweet something. I also would not be able to tell you this is a protein powder shake because 1 scoop in a blender bottle has 0 chalky texture. There is no chalky flavor just sugar milk. I am going to increase the amount of milk per 1 scoop because it has that same sugar effect as Yoo-Hoo cholcate milk. Its a bit sweet but not chalky. I will continue to use this product.
5,Tropical Punch,"Overall, this protein is the best for price and quality. I wanted a flavor to mix with water since chocolate isn't too great although it is still consumable. I've read somewhere that tropical punch mixed with water tasted like kool-aid or real ""tropical punch"" so I ended up buying the 2 lb just in case it wasn't so good. Well, it definitely does NOT taste like tropical punch or kool aid...tastes more like a watered down strawberry shake, or let's say a very bland tropical punch. it is still drinkable but i don't enjoy it too much. i would rather have just stuck with double rich chocolate since it tastes amazing with milk and is drinkable with water. for this flavor, i won't be trying it with milk. I still give the powder itself 5 stars only because the flavor doesn't affect the performance."
4,Mixes SO easily!,I got a 2lb tub of this. It mixes extremely well and tastes like hot chocolate with just milk. The only downside to chocolate flavored things is limited mixing combos. I'm getting sick of just banana and peanut butter in my shakes.
4,Its Protein,"Use milk instead of water. Tastes better. Doesn't take much, maybe a cup or less per scoop!"
4,Pretty good vanilla-ice-cream flavored whey protein,"This is one of my first protein-powder purchases from the Optimum Nutrition brand. I'm amazed how quickly ON's whey protein powder dissolved in a liquid. I usually add 1 serving of ON (24g protein) to a couple of ice cubes and soymilk or skim milk in a blender to make a delicious protein shake, and it keeps me filled and satisfied for a couple hours. I like its consistency and smooth texture; it doesn't have that extra ""stuff"" that you can detect and taste in other protein powders, likeCytosport Muscle Milk Collegiate, Vanilla Creme 5.29lbs. The reason for 4 stars? Although you can smell the vanilla ice cream flavor once the container is open, the vanilla intensity just isn't enough, especially when you mix it with water."
5,Fast Protein with Minimal Calorie Hit,Does what it is supposed to do. I use as a Pre & Post workout drink. Just add a little dextrose to help get in your system quick.
2,great protein powder not so great banana taste,"great product, best protein powder for the price. as for the banana flavor it got to become a chore to drink it. I had the chocolate before and i drank it everyday without any problem. I would recomend getting vanilla and maybe adding a banana to it. the banana flavoring just wasn't very appealing day after day."
5,YUMMY,It tastes so good I want to work out more just so I can have more of this protein shake. It goes great with water (I haven't tried it with milk yet). My previous experience was with the regular chocolate flavor. This flavor is WAY BETTER!
4,Great tasting Vanilla Protein,It has a great french vanilla taste and I enjoy it. I had been using a product that had a orange sherbet taste and tired of it. The french vanilla doesn't get old though.
3,Only tastes good with milk,"I would have preferred to take my protein with water, like I did with EAS powder but, Gold Standard is disgusting that way."
4,I like it!!,"I drink the protein with milk every time after I came back from the gym. After using this protein for one month, I found my muscles were growing. The chocolate flavor is acceptable for me"
4,Good taste and consistency,I like this protein powder it mixes relatively easy and tastes good. It's not the best chocolate shake I've tasted but really good. It's specially good when mixed with milk.I have a very sensitive stomach so it sometimes can be a little heavy but for the most part it's ok
5,Great Whey Powder,"I recently started using Gold Standard Whey after only using budget brands from superstores. At first, I thought it was all basically the same, but this stuff is great! It dissolves much more easily and doesn't leave tons of gritty stuff at the bottom of your glass. The flavors are also excellent. I've tried the Double Chocolate and Chocolate Malt and enjoyed them both. I'm looking forward to trying new flavors and doubt that I'll ever use another brand."
5,The best,This is the best stuff. You can pay $80+ for this at your gym or buy it on here for much cheaper. It tastes great. Goes great with milk.
2,Good product - Bad taste,"Stick with regular chocolate flavors. This one does not taste good unless mixed with milk. Even then it, to me, tastes like it has cinnamon in it. I bought other chocolate flavors in the past that were much better. Overall product is good though."
3,its okay,affordable- i like that when you are training a lotflavor is lackluster and disappointingfor economical reasons im giving this more cred than its worth
4,GREAT STUFF!,"Its what it is, 100% Whey.The only ""problem"" with it is that sometimes the whey gets clumpy, but i'm sure thats just a property of whey protein.Good Quality Protein, with good Flavors!"
3,Okay,The product is decent. But I expect its flavor to be much better because it is more expensive than other flavors.
3,Not whyat I expected,"I have tasted other Gold Standard Whey Protein flavors and they were great. This is the first time I try Vanilla Ice Cream. Sad to say it has a bit of a chemical taste. I have to drink it really fast so I dont taste the ""chemical"" taste. Im still taking it as it is Whey Protein, but I dont get to enjoy this Protein Shake."
3,Ew,Does what intended.... Buy a different flavor tho. This is no chocolate milk. Vanilla is probably one of my favorites.
3,Double Rich Chocolate does not taste that good,"I was using cookies and cream earlier and that was tasty and I enjoyed that having with water. This time I ordered Double Rich Chocolate and there is no taste of chocolate in it, leave alone 'rich'."
5,Good Test,"I love this chocolate flavor. It tastes good. But 5 pounds are too much for me, I think I need to spend one year using up this bottle of protein powder."
1,Taste and Texture are Terrible,"The stuff does not all mix in. It says to use 6 to 8 ounces and even when using 12 ounces of milk and stirring for a good 3-5 minutes you get this gloopy mess on top. It has bad taste too, definitely chocolate-like but very weird."
1,q,well does any body know a good healthy shake that will help you lose weight and build muscle but lose weight more ... i wanna try whey protein optimum gold standard 100% natural whey but im not finding the right reviews
1,Lactose Intolerant? Avoid this product,"I tried it, loved the taste, but the effects of the whey protein made me so violently sick I pitched the rest of the can. If you cannot tolerate Whey or milk proteins in any form, then the best advice is to Fuggedaboutit. I suggest Sun Warrior ORMUS Organically grown Super Greens and the new Sun Warrior vegetarian source protein drink instead. People who cannot tolerate milk, or are vegetarian and do not eat meat or products from animals like milk or eggs will find the Sun Warrior Protein Drink just perfect. Nope, I am not a representative for Sun Warrior, just an avid fan of such a incredibly rich and wholesome, organic source as Sun Warrior. I do not trust any of these Whey products because they do not tell you if they come from hormone fed cattle, or what. Certainly most are not organic."
1,Contaminated product,"I enjoy a variety of ON Whey products. In plastic jugs, they have a great taste. However, these variety packs have a bad metallic taste to them. I would recommend getting the 2lb. jugs instead to try a flavor, as the sampler is not representative of the product."
1,terrible tasting whey protien,the cookies and cream taste is horrible. I wish I could take it back .
1,Not good.,"I bought this shake because of it's high reviews. I have previously been drinking Herbalife protein shakes but wanted to switch to whey protein for the price and for more protein. My sister even recommended this product to me saying it was delicious. I mixed it up in my shaker cup and poured it into a glass. The aroma it gave off was terrible. It smelled like rotten eggs! I tried it anyway and sure enough, it tasted like it too! I thought maybe it was a bad batch so I had my sister try it. She said she thought it tasted fine. Maybe this is how all whey protein is??? I don't know, but definitely not for me."
2,Overall bad experience.,Did not receive the order even though tracking info said it was delivered to the front door. Filed a claim with A to Z and was told that I will get a refund but it's been more than 10 days now and still no sign of a refund. This has been a bad experience overall.
5,Awesome product,"The banana flavor is amazing, and its working very well for me. I plan on looking into some casein by ON soon."
5,best tasting protein i've ever had,"This is my second 5 lb tub of Chocolate Malt. It's delicious (and nutritious!). I am a woman who lifts fairly regularly and recommend this to anyone. I also enjoyed White Chocolate flavor, but not as much. Double chocolate was ehhhhh. They're all good with milk, but this one works with water just fine (saving the calories)."
4,Quality Protein,"Tastes great when mixed with milk, though I'd recommend a blender-type bottle, as it tends to clump up. Good balance of protein without a lot of extra fat."
4,lets get optimum.,"it's not as tasty as twin labs, but it's healthier in some degree.. when i mix it with a blender bottle, if i don't shake hard enough i get some white specks on the side of the bottle.. beats me what they are.i like it though and will prob purchase again."
5,Banana is the best flavor,"Of all the protein powders i've used, this is the best tasting and easiest to mix. I strongly suggest mixing most flavors with milk instead of water, for the chocolate and banana flavors it makes it taste much better. Of the three flavors I've tried, on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being some theoretically best tasting protein powder in the universe), I'd rate them:Banana Cream: 9Double Chocolate: 7Milk Chocolate: 4"
5,Best protein product on the market,I've tried almost every major protein product on the market and this is the best by miles. Easy to mix and pleasant to drink (Some flavors even with water) you can a ton of value for your dollar. When you mix most protein powders you get clumpy parts but this dissolves pretty easily and makes taking your shake simple and enjoyable.5/5 Stars for me and a perfect product to take before/after you workout or as a quick snack.
4,Fantastic Product,"Pros:-Low carb-low sugar-low calorie-24g of protein-dissolves completely in very little water-cooks wellCons:-taste isn't that great (for an ON protein powder). Definitely doesn't taste bad, just not as fantastic as their other flavors.-thickens a little when it sets (only have had this happen with this flavor. Possibly from the artificial caramel bits)Overall awesome product, but I'd just suggest the mocha or extreme chocolate milk flavors over this one."
5,good flavor,Put this in my coffee in the morning. Was getting tired of vanilla. I use a hand mixer to make sure it's stirred well. Tends to settle out a bit toward the bottom but a gentle shake of the thermos before decanting a cup helps to minimize that. A small price to pay over the typical chalky taste many of these products have.
3,do not like the taste,I like the flavor of Gaspari Myofusion cookies and cream better. This brand does not taste as rich as the Myofusion does. Will not buy this brand again.
4,Great protein and the best flavor ever!!,I found this Gold Standard Coffee very tasty. Gold standard is very well known in nutrition world and this presentation is no room for error.I used this protein mix with unflavored cereal. I can combine this as good meal.I felt the same effect than other gold standard proteins. Easy to digest and it has a mix of different proteins; you can use between meals or after exercise.Highly recommended for someone who needs a protein for all purpose and avoid having 1 type of protein for pre-workout and after-workout.
5,Best tasting product on the market,This whey powder is by-far the best product I've tasted. I've also shown a lot of growth in pure muscle after using it. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great protein supplement. Just mix with milk or water and you're set.
5,Excellent,"I picked up ON 100% Gold Standard Whey Protein Powder just a few days ago and I love it. I got the double rich chocolate and the taste isn't that bad. It isn't as sweet as most other powders but its a no-nonsense powder with no extras. I checked some of the powders I was using and was upset with all the additives such as crystalized taurine and creatine but ON is a straight and to the point powder.One additional thought: If it isn't sweet enough you can do two things, 1) decrease the amount of liquid used, or 2) add a touch of fat free or reduced fat chocolate syrup to add a bit of sweetness without too many calories!"
2,what happened to the quality?,"I've been buying ON's products for well over a year now and have been very happy with them. In fact, when I shop for protein powder, creatine, etc, I first look for something from ON's line. But something must have changed recently, because while this is the same protein powder I've bought before, this recent shipment is really disappointing. It tastes bitter, and doesn't mix well at all. What happened? Something definitely is off. I wish I hadn't bought a 10 pound bag of the stuff, it's not going to be pleasant choking this stuff down for the next few months."
3,Tastes okay but gives weird texture to smoothies!,"this vanilla ice-cream flavor is okay, but this powder gives a really bad creamy texture to my smoothies and I won't use it anymore."
2,Vanilla Ice Cream. Nasty tasting.,"I'll never see how good this is because I can hardly manage to choke it down after a workout. I've tried it with water and/or milk in a shaker bottle, blended with banana, yogurt, peanut butter, etc...an't make it taste decent. By time I can get it to taste like it's edible, I've mixed so much other stuff in there that I might as well have not even bothered. I got this as a gift from a friend that had a BOGO coupon from a local supplement shop, and I really wish she had the decency to get a good flavor."
2,Nasty Tasting,"I have purchased other Optimum Nutrition products but never in the 10 lb. Wouldn't you know the first 10lb bag we order is awful tasting. Oh well, when it is gone will most diffidently go back to the other flavors in the smaller amount since they are not offered in the 10lb bag."
3,Great Product Too Bad Price Has Gone Up,This product used to be available for subscribe and save and now Amazon has canceled that. It's hard to go from paying $38 to $50. I'll be looking for a cheaper alternative.
5,Just what I was looking for!!!!,Love it! Tastes great and the results are what I wanted!I will buy this product again! If you are looking for a quality product this is the way to go!
4,Yucky Aftertaste,"Heard good things about ON products so I decided to try this. It mixes well with soy milk, but it has a weird aftertaste. However, i've tried other products with even worse aftertaste, so it's not a total deal breaker."
3,"Good product, takes a long time for delivery",The 3 stars are for delivery time... even though I purchased it under amazon's two day delivery it took 11 days so if you need it right away you might want to buy it from a local store.
1,Horrible,"I bought this product on reviews, reviews said this product was not the best tasting but it was horrible... they were wrong. this product is horrible, i have only been able to drink 2 shakes, there is no way im going to be able to finish the product. my boss is a really big protein shake drinker & has drank many different types & flavors, he was barely able to stomach this product. in my opinion, dont buy this product."
3,i dont like it,"i just dont like its teast.and i ordered another one by accidently.it shows i ordered no march,but i got it on august,so i cant return it,made me so sad!!"
2,100% Whey - flavor???,"The flavor of this product isn't as good as Carb Solutions Vanilla product. Plus, it tends to be a lot more ""foamy"". I won't order it again."
1,No more Subscribe and Save - boo,"I just ordered Muscle Milk for the first time since Amazon informed me that Optimum Nutrition has pulled this from the subscribe and save program. I like the product, but not very happy with the company for pulling it from the program and raising the price."
5,Superior protein supplement!,"Taste- amazing compared to most on the market. Not for you if you like the super sweet saturated fake sugar proteins. High in BCAA's and glutamine for recovery. Best protein for the price I have tried, and I have tried almost every major brand. Only down side is cholesterol as with most whey proteins."
1,Vanilla Vanilla,"Vanilla is so bland. I have tried many flavors of Gold standard and if you are looking for the one with the least flavor, this one is probably it. It did work well to mix with my strawberry pre-workout drink that has a strong flavor because the vanilla was unnoticeable."
4,Not a bad purchased,"I like ON whey, I just am not a fan of the artifical ingredients in the whey I can afford. My favorite flavor is extreme milk chocolate, but rocky road and double rich chocolate are so-so. Not bad."
5,Good product for the price,"ON products are a great value. This stuff is hard to beat, and it has glutimine already in it; Bonus! shop around you will be hard pressed to find better bang for the buck on protein. Tastes good too."
1,BE CAUTIOUS!!!,"This was my fifth tub and I have been pleased with it until I learned of what is actually in it. Along with almost all others, it contains arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury!!! Why? Is it made in China!? Check it out online or in the July 2010 issue of Consumer Reports. The powder with the least of these was Solgar. That is what I will most likely be switching to."
2,French Vanilla Creme is FAIR,"French Vanilla Creme was just bearable. It wasnt very bad, but just bearable enough to keep intaking this for the next 2 months. Will i purchase this again? Nope.I thought this was going to taste something like mocha flavor, but i was totally wrong. It taste like vanilla with bannana and less tasteful.I have a very good taste bud since i like to try every food in this earth, including hot and spicy stuff, all meat, pasta, and, maybe, insects.It can range anywhere from Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mexicans, Thai, Fiji, and Italian food.Alot of the foods that i eat are very delicious.But, this is just bearable!"
1,LESS than 1 star,"Absolutely horrible taste. It tastes like chemicals. No idea how this got so many good reviews, unless these people are putting a lot of bananas, ice cream, or other things into their protein shake. I mix mine with milk or water, and this is the worst protein I've ever tasted."
1,SUPRISING TO SEE ANTIHEALTH SUCRALOSE IN WHEY,I was very disappointed to find antihealth sucralose in a whey product and I intend to return it.
1,"big size, so so product","This 10 lbs whey protein is very nice size but is so so quality, i used it for a few months and nothing amazing happened, but when i changed to the muscletech and eas produts i feel a big change. Also the price here is too expensive in comparison with other stores."
1,You need to be a moron to order from this vendor,I can't believe no one else noticed that the shipping charges are outrageous for this company - about 5 times what they should be.I put the name on my black list.
5,Good whey to go,"The price isn't too bad on this protein, especially if you subscribe to receive it regularly through Amazon (which I do). From what I've read, it is a very effective protein for the price. Would recommend for those looking to start a protein regimen."
5,"Very good, tasty protein powder","I like this protein powder a lot. It tastes very good and is also easy to digest. It does not upset my stomach at all. In contrast, some other proteins give me acid reflux which is very inconvenient. Price wise it is also competitive with other products in the market. I will be using this in the future as well."
5,Switched to Optimum,"I switched from protein plus (jillian's recommended) that i bought at Target to Optimum Nutrition based on a friend's recommendation. He claims it is better, higher in protein isolates. I'm not sure. it has 5.5 grams of BCAAs; PPlus had 5. It has 24 grams of protein vs. 25 of PPlus.I had my first shake tonight. I can say, using the exact same ingrediants, this tastes much better. Seemed to blend better, but that might just be appearances. However, I do like the tastes. Seems to cost about the same also. Not enough of a difference to dicker over."
4,"Tastes Good, not great. Mixes OK","My son is a hockey player and I purchased this for him to use as supplement after practices and games. Previously, we purchased the EAS powder, but after reading the Consumer Reports article decided that it would be better to find a brand that had less issues with dangerous impurities. The Optimum brand items reviewed in Consumer Reports passed. He mixes it in milk and it tastes fine, not great. It would be nice if it disolved easier, but it is no worse than the EAS powder. My daughter (a soccer player) makes fruit smoothies and adds the powder. Really can't say if it helps or not, but we are happy with it. As a parent, I like it for my kids as a snack replacement after exercising, but not as a meal replacement."
5,Delicious,"I love this powder really fulfills my hunger, and it's great after working out! I combine it with shakeology and improves so much the taste of it and the you get much full with it. I personally use half and half of a regular scoop to take more advantage of shakeology since is SO expensive."
4,"Tastes better than Vanilla Ice Cream, but not as good as Cookies and Cream","It tastes far better than vanilla ice cream, but cookies and cream is still my favorite. I would not order the vanilla ice cream again."
5,Excellent taste,First time I buy protein powder. Read many reviews of wired tasting products. This one has an excellent taste even with water. Go for it!!!
4,"Economically Viable, Dependable Protein","I use the Vanilla Creme protein powder in oatmeal in the mornings and in smoothies sometimes. Drinking this with water is less appetizing, as the drink will foam up a lot and it tastes pretty synthetic. Not bad, just not outstanding. I use the Extreme Milk Chocolate, which tastes great, for drinking after workouts or throughout the day. The chocolate is not as good for mixing with other foods, however."
2,Bad taste,"This smells and tastes a bit like the synthetic flavoring on microwave popcorn. I've tried many different flavors of this product before and they were very good, however this one is not. It's a limited time flavor the packaging says; there is a good reason for that."
5,Great tasting protein shake.,This is a great tasting product for those looking for a protein shake. It has a great flavor and dissolves great. I would recommend it to anyone looking to add more protein to their diet for whatever reason.
3,Tropical Punch,I ordered the Tropical Punch flavor and I just have one thing to say. It tastes like Pepto Bismol!! Not a good flavor :(It also stays very foamy after shaking. Going to try strawberry banana next
5,Best Tasting Protein i tried.,"ON whey gold standard, Double Rich Chocolate was the first protein i tried. The taste is very enjoyable just like quik chocolate milk even though i drink it with water. I use a blender bottle and i never have a problem mixing it up.I have tried other brands of whey protein and i cant get my-self to enjoy them as i enjoy ON whey gold standard.About gains well I'm working on it so cant really comment on that.For me this is the best Whey protein out there, I would definitely recommend it."
4,ON 100% whey is so standard,"This stuff mixes so easily that I have added it to yogurt, oatmeal, and even iced coffee. Granted, that was usually the Vanilla flavor, but I'm sure you could get brave with the chocolate (or other flavors). Less than $0.50 a serving if you sign up for the auto-renew is a great deal."
5,Good Price for Veterans or Beginners,They manage to give you a good price per serving and you can see results in about 2 weeks. I consider a great deal compared to the prices of all the other proteins out there and it really helps you out with you want nice lean muscles.
5,Best Protein for the Price!!!!,I love this protein! It is the best protein for the price that I have found (including bodybuilding.com). With my Amazon Prime account I get free 2 day shipping and you can't beat that. This protein tastes pretty good and even with 1.5 scoops after a workout it's lasted me more than a month.
2,Taste did not match with G N C product,"I duno I didnot like the taste of the product shipped. Actually, earlier I bought same product from G N C I found it taste different.."
4,eh...,"Its not a bad taste for a protein shake. For the most part its just ok, although there are some days when i can't handle it. I still love my chocolate!!"
5,double rich chocolate,I blend mine with milk and it tastes just like chocolate milk. Add a little extra powder or less fluid for a more sweeter taste.
4,Whey is Effective!,Whey is a siginificant source of protein. My son has been a user for over 3 years. He exercises and uses it as a source of protein as he lifts weights sometimes. He states that he fills satisified and not interested in eating junk food. His muscle mass has improved according to him.Whey's claims on the nutritional label appear to be true and effective. My son would recommend Whey for other interested individuals.Great product!Yoli Navarro
4,Some of the flavors aren't so good,"I have gone through this product 4 times now, and I must say that I have only tried two flavors: Double Rich Chocolate and Rocky Road. Rocky Road tastes mega sweet and has a sickening sweet smell.On the other hand the chocolate one is by far the best protein shake flavor I have had. I highly suggest trying out several flavors to determine what you like before ordering a larger size to avoid the mistake that I had made."
3,Double Rich Chocolate is not for beginners!,"I'm on a 12 week diet plan administered by my nutritionist. I'm no ""protein expert"" as some would say, so if you are new to this and looking for something that tastes good like I am - at least to jump-start your new regimen, I'd skip this product.I started with one whey protein type (name unknown), along with Optimum Nutrition's chocolate casein (heavenly!). So when the initial whey supply ran out, I thought that Optimum Nutrition's double chocolate would be even better given my pleasure with the casein.Wrong.The double rich chocolate is anything but rich. In fact, I've decreased the amount of water I put in hoping to make it thicker and more richer, but it is still bland. Cold, warm, semi-cold, semi-warm... it doesn't matter. Too bad.As far as results go, I can't attribute any *one* thing - including this mix - to my success because I'm doing many things differently that cumulatively are working."
3,"good quality protein, meh taste","The shipping was fast and everything came as expected, so there's no complaints about the vendor. I've had other ON whey powders in the past and have been really impressed with them for the most part. I read several reviews about how great French vanilla was, but when I tried it with milk I was very disappointed. The protein taste is not completely masked; even though the drink smells great, there is a pretty awful aftertaste. Despite this, the protein is good and I have no complaints otherwise. For anyone interested, mocha cappuccino, caramel toffee fudge, rocky road, and chocolate coconut have been my favorites."
4,Best Protein!,Absolutely the best protein I've tasted. I gave it a 4 star because I was disappointed that the price went up $10 whereas every other flavor did not.
4,Review for Mint Chocolate flavor,"It was strange to try this flavor after drinking the plain chocolate flavor for a while. The mint seemed overpowering, and...different...not like mint chocolate ice cream, like I was expecting. I wasn't a fan of this flavor the first couple times I tried it, but since I bought it, I figured I may as well get my money's worth. Well, after the initial flavor shock wore off, I really began to enjoy the mint chocolate. Now that I'm used to it, I think it's perfectly delicious, and would definitely buy it again. I just had to realign my taste expectations with reality."
3,Taste ok... But Great protein,I just bought this for before and after my workouts. This was my first protein powder i ever bought. The taste was terrible i mean ok. I tried it with milk btw. With water taste pretty bad. It doesn't taste anything like cookies and creams. It smell like coffee. Overall i'll give the taste a 6/10. Next time i'm going to try the chocolate :]
3,Tropical Punch Whey Protein,I just got my Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Protein yesterday. Well i had a good workout today and I was excited about taking the Tropical Punch flavor. Once I tasted it.. well it wasnt too great. It kinda tasted liked tropical punch but it tasted like medicine or tropical punch with a milky flavor.
1,Was awesome- dont know whats wrong with it,"The cookies and cream product used to be awesome. Ordered my first one couple of months back and it was the best protein flavor made by Optimum. The next one that came in had something horribly wrong with it. Smelled like crap, did not mix well in water and was nasty overall. Sent that back and Amazon sent us another one as a replacement. This one does not smell, but has the same mixing / color issue. Maybe Optimum had a bad batch or they have changed their formula. Pretty much sucks now."
3,good protein bad taste (mint),i love optimum whey and several of their flavors are incredible but this isnt one of them.... still a solid protien shake though
2,Not the best tasting...,I bought 100% Whey protein the double chocolate flavor today because I couldn't get to a store that sells my usual Jay Robb protein. I have to say the taste is not even close to what I'm use to. Its not repulsive or anything but Jay Robb's protein taste is way better. For some reason Jay Robbs even makes me feel more.... fuller....satisfied.Glad I just bought the small 1 lb.
5,Excelent product,Excelent product. Great flavor (even better than chocolate). It really do what's supossed to... adding lean muscle mass to your body. No complaints
5,AMAZING,"I have gotten multiple of this product and it never ceases to amaze me! I was considering getting the hydrowhey from the same company but I realized from other reviews that its basically the same and the scoop is bigger so actually when they say it has more protein, it actually dosen't... it has just a little more protein per serving but not too much more! I'd rather get this one its cheaper and I can drink more scoops and it'll last longer for me. I got mocha cappuchino and the taste blew me away! With milk it tasted just like a mcdonalds iced cappuchino! Amazing product!"
3,Not bad but the protective seal was missing,I honestly don't mind the taste at all but I was a little surprised when I opened the package only to discover the protective seal was detached from the protein bottle. It makes me question what I actually got :/
3,Strawberry Banana is disgusting,Dont buy Strawberry Banana unless you like a very artificial taste. It does not taste like either fruit at all. I hate it and am mixing other stuff with it just to get through the terrible taste. I rather drink peptobismal stomach ache medication.ON Creamy Vanilla Casein powder is really good though. It blends so well with a few spoon spins and its even better with less water. I eat it like pudding before bed.
4,Decent Taste,This is my first time taking Whey. So I don't have a lot of experience in reviewing it. However I think the taste isn't bad and its easy mixing. I have had it less than a month and have put on a few pounds of lean muscle. I'll be getting it again.
5,Wheeeeyyyyy,Name brand Whey For a good price!! This particular whey came recommended by my personal trainer as the best one around!1
4,Good Value,"This has a decent flavor but a little sweet for me. I sometimes add a little unsweetened cocoa powder to give it a deeper flavor. Easy to mix, low in carbs. Add extra flavorings to mix it up, peppermint, rasberrry crystal lite, good instant coffee crystals for mocha. Enjoy"
2,The second time I tried ON protein. There will NOT be a third,"I bought Optimum Nutrition Whey protein this time because there was more protein than their competitors.When I tried ON protein the first time I found the drink to be thin and runny. but the flavor was good.This time it is even thinner than before, and the flavor is almost non existent.I have tried ON whey protein, twice, GNC whey protein, and two others that I will not name because their consistency was like mixing water and sand.For flavor and consistency so far I MUCH prefer the GNC proteinI recommend you avoid Optimum Whey Protein if taste and consistency are important to you"
5,AMAZING,"this is my favorite protein by far, easy to mix, great taste, good BCAA's & i couldn't ask for more ."
2,Taste not great,I bought the Vanilla Ice Cream based on the reviews it had and I prefer to order from amazon vs other sellers. But the taste of this product isn't great at all not sure how I would be able to finish the bottle. I just hope something isn't wrong with it because amazon is currently reviewing this item.
4,Value & Taste,One of the best protein powders available on the market. I bought the last one at GNC for almost 10 bucks more. It is a good deal from Amazon. Double rich Chocolate flavor. Taste is pretty good if you drink it with non-fat milk. Tastes better and mixes better than the GNC brand protein. This is my usual after-workout drink. I will most likely order my next one from Amazon too.
4,good product,"price is good and paper bag is more flexible than the giant bottle.find out costco has different brand name product with same size.This big size should have more discount.After all, this is good product."
4,Protein drink,"Optimum Nutrition Gpld 100 % Whey is the best tasting power protein drink mix that I have found. 60mg. of protein in one glass. The product mixes easily with water, but I prefer non-fat milk and some ice in a mixer. The taste is great. Many flavors - I like to mix Milk Choc..or Double Choc. with the Vanilla Ice cream mix. Yum ! Great for Gastric ByPass patients to get your protein fast. Online price is good too !"
5,Best Protein Supplement,This is the best protein powder that I have consumed compared to other similar products. I did some research on the type of protein that is good for muscle building and everyday consumption and found a lot of information about whey protein. I researched different brands and found Optimum Nutrition very popular. I feel good after drinking protein shakes. I got the best deal on Amazon for a 5 lbs protein powder tub. I am so happy with the product that I have signed up for frequent automatic shipments.
4,Taste Great but...,"When I first started working out I just bought the regular GNC brand protein and it was ok but I really didn't want to drink it so I gradually left the weightlifting scene behind. Now that I'm back in it I read some reviews and decided to buy this brand but unfortunately GNC only had Double Chocolate (not a choc fan) but I bought it anyways. I just use water since I can't tolerate milk that well and it still taste amazing and I don't even like chocolate all that much. I shake mine and have never had a problem with clumping or anything. There are other products that have a lot more protein per serving but why down a shake that taste like [...] once a day when you can drink this at every meal and more. Will order Vanilla next since that flavor is my favorite so hopefully it taste just has good. Buy from Amazon, GNC is too expensive."
3,Not a good flavor choice,"There's no question that ON makes quality protein powders, and most actually taste fantastic. But for anyone who is contemplating taking a chance and trying this flavor for variety sake, I advise against it. It comes off as a little too strong, and tastes like nothing resembling cookies n' cream in my opinion. Stick with good old chocolate or vanilla type flavors.Aside from the taste, the protein quality was the usual high quality blend, and the consistency of the drink when blended was great."
3,very good product,whey is a very good source of protein but trust me whey choosing please think of the taste the vanilla ice creams only smells nice when you open up the container but tastes disgusting.
3,Overrated,"Well, I bought this because I kept hearing about how it's the best for the money. While I didn't think it was completely horrible, it just wasn't what I expected. The stuff mixes great, but tastes pretty rough, and that's coming from a guy who can drink body fortress chocolate whey all day long.I give this product 3 stars because it mixes better than alot of proteins I've tried and hey maybe you'll like it. Me, I'll stick with my Myofusion. Stuff can't be beat."
2,not delicious,I've been using whey protein for almost a year. this so called deciduous strawberry doesn't taste good. not awful either!
2,Not very flavorful but very filling,"This flavor is kind of weird. When I make a shake with the recommended 6-8oz of water or milk and some ice, it doesn't taste very chocolately so it's not as tasty as I was expecting. However, it is VERY filling, which is awesome. I usually can't finish a whole shake."
4,Too Sweet,"Everyone's taste buds are different, but this Whey blend is too sweet for my taste. Otherwise appears to be a good product."
5,Banana Cream = WINNING,I have never set taste as a very high priority when determining what brand to go with. I could always just wolf it down. This is by far the tastiest protein shake I've ever had(i am big into bananas). Tastes great with low-fat milk or water. I will update with results in the coming weeks because i just began using this product along with my second time through p90x( first time through was last year)
5,Excellent,"5lbs of protein for less money than 3lbs of other products (for example, GNC AMP). Dissolves very well, an entire serving in an 8 oz cup and it dissolves, I am not used to this. The product works, it's cheap, and above all, it's a supplement. It's there to help you, not do the work for you. Don't think twice, buy ON 100% Whey, and buy it from Amazon."
2,TOO Sweet,"I got halfway through the bottle and could NOT get myself to finish the rest, it's TOO SWEET. Yeah, they're saving the consumer calories, but the sucralose dosage in this stuff is overkill, highly recommend ON's ""Any Whey,"" it's all natural; ""Any Whey"" will be my next purchase on Amazon. My only credibility I have is I have lost count of the bottle's of Optimum Nutrition Pro-Complex Whey since first using in 2005.. hope this review helps."
3,flavor and body profile,"The ""Delicious Strawberry"" product tastes too much like Pepto-Bismol. Not that I don't like Pepto-Bismol but that is for when you are sick, not well. It makes it hard to drink for me. Also the body of the product seems inconsistent for me when prepared either in a blender or shaker. I am not really sure about this but it just seems that there are portions that are more viscous, almost like lumps, but not quite.As far as the nutrition effects of this product I am unable to say."
2,Tastes horrible,I tried this after reading some positive reviews but in my opinion it tastes horrible. I will stick to the fruit punch flavor from now on.
4,Does What It Is Supposed To,"Love the product. Great protein, low in carbs. The Cookies & Cream flavor could definitely be better but when I make it into a smoothy with milk, a banana, and some ice it becomes much easier to drink. Will buy definitely buy again!"
4,Great Stuff,"This stuff really works. It fills you up, satisfies your protein needs, and is some of the most affordable protein on the market. Highly recommend for those wanting to put on lean muscle mass. Its low carbohydrate content makes it harder to gain weight however so not as effective in that regard. Other than that, tastes great and highly recommend!"
2,Don't recommend the strawberry banana flavor,I figured I'd branch out from the more simple flavors like chocolate or vanilla. I don't think strawberry banana is nearly as good.
4,WHY IS IT GETTING SO EXPENSIVE??,Optimum whey is simply the best and has worked for me over the years.....but why does the price keep rising EVERY TIME I PURCHASE HERE??Used to be $35...then $40ish....now $52.99??? for a tub of powder??
5,works great!,"This is the type of protein i always use because it is the best one i've tried. It tastes good, it mixes well, its not too expensive, and it works great! I've noticed I get stronger a lot faster when I am consistently using this stuff."
4,TROPICAL PUNCH WHEY PROTEIN,"Decent tasting protein and good price for value of protein. I prefer fruit flavors to the regular chocolate and vanilla shakes and this fits the bill. The best tasting fruit flavor is still 4ever fruit whey isolate, but this is much cheaper. It mixes easily in water or crystal light. Tried it in almond milk and it was not so good. Also it only requires a shaker bottle no blender, big plus for me since I carry it with me to work and the gym."
2,Bad flavor,Strawberry flavor ain't a good choice.. Chocolate flavor is a way better flavor in the same product..
4,Liked it,"Purchased the double choco variety and thought it was great. Dissolved the best of any whey protein we've tried so far, and it tasted good too."
4,price points,"I buy Optimum Gold Standard for my whey protein all the time. There aren't very many whey proteins that are better. A good place to check for ratings is bodybuilding.com they constantly have tests, ratings and reviews from serious body builders and people who train hard. Price is the selling point on this though. Just four years ago you could ge the ten pound bag for under $75 on Bodybuilding.com. It is at or above $100 on all sites now. The positive of getting it on Amazon though is the free shipping which will cost you at least $15 on BB.com. So I buy it through Amazon now as well."
5,fantastic whey,"This is very good for just a whey protein mix. It is low in fat and carbs, so there is no way it's going to taste like Muscle Milk or anything, but this is lightyears ahead of other low carb, low fat whey mixes I've had. It mixed VERY well, and it actually tastes pretty good, downright tasty when mixed in milk! It even includes a healthy dose of glutamine, aminos, and other complexes. And with Subscribe and Save and Super Saver shipping, I really couldn't be happier! I've heard good things about the vanilla flavor too, I'll have to give that a shot next..."
3,Just too sweet for me,"Overall I do like the product. It has just the right amount of protien at 24g, 3g Carbos and no sugar. It mixes very easily in cold water with no lumps. I would buy again if they would get rid of or greatly reduce the sweetener. The sucralose sweetener is just way too much and makes me almost gag!! I really would prefer this product with a no sugar option."
5,Best Protein in the Market,"Undisputedly best Whey Protein in the market. I tried the double choclate flavor. Its very good. i didnt changed any flavors,i was addicted to it. i might change the flavor in future.Have a Rich Protein Shake after your workout as below..Very Delicious and Nutritious !!1-11/2 scoops of ON 100% whey1 full banana5gms of Dextrose or sugar (use dextrose for spike and fast absorbance to muscles)Blend it..Its really very delicious and nutritious post workout shake.Taste - 9Mixability-8Efficiency-9Price- 9Value-9Pros- Its taste,value,results, mixability and price.Cons- it smells a lill uncomfortable if you uses just with waterStack it with ON 100% Casein(slow releasing or bed time protein) if you are looking for serious gains or into a body building.Go For it !! U will Never Regret :-)!!"
3,Not bad...,"The name, double rich chocolate, makes it sound like it would have a strong chocolate taste; but it doesn't. While the taste wasn't bad, it was barely there. Using the recommending amounts, I found it hard to drink with water. I had to use less water or more powder to make it drinkable. Not bad, but I but a different flavor next time."
4,Good Protein,"I bought the cake batter flavor. Its pretty good, but if your expecting it to taste amazing your wrong. It has a protein grainy taste like all others ive tried. But it mixes better than most other brands and is pretty low priced"
4,Whey protein,I go to the gym religiously for about 5 times a weeks and I drink this stuff like water. My muscle restores pretty quickly and this proten shake does not give me the gassy feeling other protein shakes give me. I have high energy level during workouts and I don't feel so sore. I like that it is low sodium so i dont have to worry about high blood pressure. I am not picky with food so this shake taste pretty good to me. definitely recommend it.
5,Taste Great,This isn't the best tasting protein that I have ever drank but it is very good. The calories are very low compared to some other brands. 280 calories for 48 grams of whey protein blend.
3,"Good price, bad taste","I tried Vanilla Ice Cream and the value for the price is great, it is far less expensive here than other retailers and its a decent product but the taste is horrible. I normally can drink it with water but it tastes like chalk, so i have to mix it with milk just to choke it down. This is the first Opt. nutrition protein i have tried so next time i will try a different flavor."
3,Strawberry Banana? Nope its Pepto Bismol,"Ordered the Strawberry Banana flavor. Made a shake with the powder and when I went to taste it, I thought I was drinking Pepto Bismol. Strawberry Banana is just an awful flavor."
4,"good taste and mixability, very sweet","While the product mixed very well and tasted fine with milk or water, it was VERY SWEET to my taste. I did not expect it to be sweetened since, silly me, I only checked the label for sugar content and didn't think to check for artificial sweeteners.I bought the vanilla flavor so it would go with smoothies. It also makes a kick-ass iced latte-- out of coffee or tea. Brew it hot with twice as much coffee/tea leaves, pour over ice, swirl it around to make it cold, and then take out the ice cubes before you add the whey product or else it will clump all over the ice.Overall this is a good product, but I would prefer an UNSWEETENED variety. Maybe that would taste like crap, but I would rather add honey, maple syrup, or Stevia to something if I want it sweet. I will try the ""Natural"" version of Optimum Nutrition's whey protein when I am out of this one."
4,"Good, but not my taste","The product came very quickly, about 3-4 days, and didn't have any problems. As for the protein itself, it definitely has a rich, pure chocolate taste. In water, it's not very sweet, but still has a rich chocolate taste. In milk, it's a little sweeter/tastes better, but still has a strong chocolate taste. I guess rich chocolate just isn't a flavor that's for me, but it's not so bad that I don't want to drink the shakes. Also, the powder mixes ok with a spoon- there's usually a few small clumps of protein left. However, if you blend it, no clumps."
2,Tastes disgusting with water,"Ordered this, came in time and I chose the banana flavor, my last brand was syntha6 chocolate and it tasted amazing, switched over to whey with banana cream with water and it tasted horrible."
5,EXCELENTE! LLEGO MUCHO ANTES DE LO ESTIPULADO,"estoy muy contento con la rapidez con que fue enviado el producto, solo tardo 2 dias en llegar a miammi- mas tardo quien me lo trajo el pais."
4,Good product,I don't know how to test this product. I buyed because somebody recommended it. I drink it just after exercise. My only complaint is about flavor. It feels artificial. I gave 4 stars in name of the recognition it has but I didnt feel an specific effect in my body.
5,Tastes great. High in protein.,"What more could you ask for? It tastes great (I got the double rich chocolate flavor), mixes easily and is loaded in protein. Low sugar/calories/etc.The taste isn't so great mixed with water, so I usually mix it with 6oz. of 1% milk. You can use a shaker or just a spoon.Protein is something a lot of people don't think about while dieting and this is a tasty way to remember it. =) If you don't want to lose your muscle mass along with that fat I'd certainly recommend a protein supplement and this is hard to beat."
4,Taste's GREAT...but too many artificial sweetners.,This product tastes great and mixes well. Only problem I have with it is it's lack of vitamins and minerals and it has too many artificial sweetners...something I try to avoid.
4,Great Product,I have tried everything and this is the product for me personally. I think it tastes better than any other one that I have tried. Perhaps taste is the biggest factor for me. Most of the ingredients and results are the same as other quality products but I have to drink it everyday. My best friend hates but I love it. Rich Chocolate please
4,"Decent flavor, great powder","I had the tropical punch flavor: with water alone, it had a weird taste that I was not partial to. Most water mixed powders I can drink down pretty quickly, but this one I could not drink quickly.Mixed with milk alone, this tasted pretty good. Had a fruit punch milkshake kind of flavor, which while odd was completely stomachable and decent.I also like to make smoothies, and I will say, this mixed with strawberry+banana+yogurt+juice was not great. Using a fruit punch as my juice made it better but Vanilla powder goes so much better in this smoothie. The fruit punch had a strong noticeable flavor and I think other flavors would not be so prevalent."
5,great taste,for me tastes good with just water.. it dissolves easily without any lumps so it's really easy to drink it straight - bottoms-up!
3,"Protein:Calorie Great, Taste not so great","After tasting musclemilk, its very hard to drink this. Instead I mix it with my oatmeal in teh morning. The taste and ability to dissolve are not very good. Mixing with Milk helps, but at that point you may as well get musclemilk.Overall, I would say Musclemilk light is the way to go if you are looking for low calories and good protein and taste."
5,Worth the hype,"Very good whey. Good gains and keeping my muscle while I lose weight. Has low calories and taste great. Mixes well, any made by on is top notch buy with confidence."
5,Using it in combination,"Right now, I am using the 'Optimum Nutrition Glutamine Powder' + 'Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey' (Taste is decent) + 'Prolab Creatine Monohydrate Powder' + 'N-Large 2 Protein Powder' (Best taste out there). And I have added 34 pounds on 3 months with just few body fat. Sorry I cannot review the product individually, I felt I would not be fair if I do so."
2,fatally flawed flavor,"Terribly sweet flavor, it kind of makes me want to spit it out, it's that terrible. I made a mistake by ordering this flavor instead of what I usually get - the Double Rich Chocolate. That one is delicious, you can mix 3 servings with 16 oz of milk and it is good. While Extreme milk is forcing me to use just 1 serving per 16 oz of milk, to be tolerable. I guess combining it with cereal or using it in some other way might make it less terrible."
4,The Look & Smell,"The Tropical Punch flavor looks and smells like Pepto Bismol. No, really. It does. I like the chocolate flavors better. Still however the best damn protein on the market."
