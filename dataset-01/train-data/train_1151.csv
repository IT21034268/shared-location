4,Early 90s Fun,"Raw Like Sushi captures the musical trends of 1989/1990. Listening to this brings to mind Lisa Stansfield's Affection, Soul II Soul's Club Classics Vol. One and Prince's Lovesexy.More than two decades later, Raw Like Sushi still holds up. And if this was released today, will draw comparisons with Nicki Minaj.You might as well get The EU version which contains some extras:My BitchHeart (It's A Demo)Buffalo Stance (Sukka Mix)Manchild (Old School Mix)The funky itchy vibe runs throughout. So Here I Come - I Came Already! (20 Years ago) LOL!"
5,Plain but simple,I love reading this information. I can really apply this knowledge from live to class to my practicum site and working with head start kids. It is truly a blessing to know what it takes to make a difference in the lives of the younger generations.
2,Toni Iommi - 'The 1996 Dep Sessions' (Sanctuary) 2 1/2 stars,"Wasn't even aware of this title,nor the other couple of releases the Black Sabbath guitarist had available.After checking this CD out,I can only tell you it's more melodic hard rock than anything else.Some may call it 'commercial' hard rock.Only tracks that did anything for me were ""From Another World"",""Don't Drag The River"" and maybe ""Time Is The Healer"".Appears this CD's nine(9) tunes were penned anwhere between 1996-2004.Honestly think that completists would likely get more out of this disc than I did.Line-up:Tony Iommi-guitar,Glenn Hughes-bass&vocals,Don Airey-keyboards and Jim Copley-drums."
2,"2.5 stars- Nothing great, so try to take these overhyped reviews with a grain of salt","I'll be back for a longer review but just want to make one observation for the mean time. I really can't stand Glenn Hughes singing voice. He often sounds crazy, like he's some kind of madman. Bring back Tony Martin because he at least can sing. I think I'll just sell my copies of FUSED and 96'DEP SESSIONS and stick with all the Ozzy Sabbath albums through about FORBIDDEN (not counting BORN AGAIN because it sucks big-time) and leave the Iommi solo albums alone. Listen to the one or two reviews that are a rating of three stars or under because these reviewers don't know what they're talking about."
3,This is it ?????.,"Sorry guys, but what a dissapointment... I bought this CD because of the great reviews that were written about it. Iommi's guitar playing is nothing special.. no great leads that I'm aware of. The vocals is what really kills this CD.... I've heard Glenn Hughes sound much,much better.This CD is totally overblown or overhyped... ""SEVENTH STAR"" is a much better album in my opinion.. You want to hear some great guitar work ?? try GARY MOORE..... Of course, everyone has their own opinion."
2,Overhyped...,"I bought this recently because of all the glowing reviews on here. Well, I was pretty disappointed, I can tell ya. I was expecting the melodic, lush keyboard filled majesty of Seventh Star, one of my favourite heavy rock albums. This album is nowhere near as strong as that one was- maybe thats' why they initially shelved it. A couple of the songs don't even have any real melody- 'Time is the Healer' is a completely tuneless sludgefest. Also, Glenn Hughes wasn't singing like such a maniac on Seventh Star as he is here- he was more restrained back then, not overdoing it all the time like he tends to do these days. Don't get me wrong, I love these guys- they have made some brilliant music over the years. But theres' a bunch of overhyped, misleading reviews on here that lead a prospective buyer to think this album is some sort of rock Holy Grail, and it ain't- its' pretty ordinary. I think I'll go listen to Seventh Star now..."
4,An Interesting Material,"I was recommended to read this material, which examines life and its origins from an engineering point-of-view and the author was proposing a ""Rational Design Hypothesis"" - a ""5th Option"" that explains the origin of life. It's such a fascinating read on the subject of how the Earth was ""designed"" in the first place as well as his excellent analysis of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) - the what's and the how's of it all.I gave it four out of five stars for this book due to its interesting ideas and theories on the subject, but I have found the author's speculative scenarios to be rather distressing and unsatisfying. Additionally, the text has become too hulking dense for me to read through as it took a few weeks for me to get through it but his interesting ideas were driving my curiosity and energy to read it all. Still, it's an interesting material."
5,The most likely option,"To hell with priests (no offence Fr.Farragher or Fr. Cooney, if you're reading this!) and to black holes with materialist scientists who claim that life just sort of ""happened when some stuff bumped into some other stuff and that consciousness just arose as an 'accidental by-product.'"" I'm going with this author who gives another option and does a damn better job of backing up his hypothesis than either science or religion has. It may be that both science and religion are partly right but since they've refused to work with each other over the last couple of centuries, they've contributed very little to figuring out any answers to our deepest questions. Don't expect all the answers from this book but do expect a very reasonable argument that suggests that there has been a ""bit of conscious engineering"" involved in the creation of life, the universe and everything."
5,What a challenging and brilliant concept!!!,"Since I was a child I often wondered how this world was created and, as I gazed at a night sky, I wondered who is up there on all those planets.A friend who was fascinated with this book encouraged me to read it and I became so engrossed with the possibilities it explores I found it hard to put down. In all my life I've never been exposed to such a unique - and convincing - argument about the origin of my world! I have mentally shot holes in the widely accepted 4 other origins of life. I'm finding it extremely difficult to fault the author on his logic despite my skeptical nature.The fact that the author Mr. Shiller is an engineer, gives his approach a logical train of thought and development that is very hard to refute.Don't read this ground breaking book unless you enjoy fresh thinking and a challenge to conventional wisdom. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!!"
1,"very disappointed, sorry to say","Great premise but very hard to believe children with autism can follow. I am an OT with many years experience. I am certified in children's yoga , SI, trained in Brain Gym, etc. I am always looking for good resources for my students teachers and parents. I would not ask any of them to buy this, even though the premise has some validity. It just does not translate for practical help if you are working with children or a child with autism."
3,The sound on game.,The soundtrack on this game is not playing in Dolby Digital...just Dolby Surround/ProLogic. Perhaps this was the way it was meant to play. A number of improvements have been made to this game as far as movements and such compared to the previously released Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I have only viewed the game while someone else was playing (Christmas gift)and that was when I noticed the display saying it was reproducing sound only in ProLogic.
3,Ok movie,This movie was ok for hat it is a movie of videos. I honestly liked it a little more than ok but that could be because I love Prince.
3,Ahead of its time,"Of all the Prince films 3 Chains of Gold is the most ahead of its time. So ahead that now 5 years later I still find it confusing. Prince, who at the time was 0->, wrote a hodgepodge of action film and spirtual mumbo jumbo. Though beautifully shot 3 chains is over all dull. Especially the dancing. Buy the CD instead. It contains some of the most underated songs of Prince's career. This film is only for the serious collector."
4,I love this video,This video is like a movie...I like the tie ins between each song from the +(> album...Prince is ahead of his time.
3,palmers,"Using this product will give you a glow,but if you use too much you will get a silvery unnatural finish on your skin."
1,Wasn't what I expected,"Afterhearing the rave about this product, I decided to give it a try and I was very disappointed and really don't understand what the rave is all about. However, I purchased the Palmers Cb Moisture Gel Oil SPF#15 7 oz and liked that one better. But as for this one, it did not do anything it was suppose to do and as for me a waste of 8 bucks. : ("
4,too bad it's discontinued...,"during the summer months, when a tan is an option...this cream gives a shimmer to the skin that makes it appear to glow.sure, it doesn't have the same yummy cocoa smell that palmers usually has...but i use the two creams together to get the sheen plus the fragrance.it is a shame that they've stopped making it."
1,"returned item, no refund","I bought this item for my daughter and we decided not to purchase a nano, so I returned the product. Unfortunately, I did not receive a refund for the product. I contacted them approx. 3 times by e-mail, but had no response. Company not on the up and up."
3,small phone but...,The size is very small but the reception is very bad. U have to keep it outside your pocket to have reception. The camera is enough 1.3mp . it is very stylish and anyone who sees it finds it amazing. The battery life is not that bad. I charge it every two days and i talk alot on the phone.it is a cool phone on the outside but not that good inside.
3,Oui.....mais,"First CD of a Singer who bientot will become the number 1 (see his(her,its) Manon Lescaut and his André Chénier) - christian (France)"
3,"This book is for the ""very"" beginner.",Not really help for the marketers who are familiar with wireless marketing.
3,Good material but too much fluff,"There we many examples of world class communities and how they attract and retain business. That was one of the problems I had with the book. There were just too many examples. A good editor could have cut the size of this book in half. The material contrasting the global view (cosmopolitan) against the local view, was thought provoking."
2,"Outdated, overpriced and not for kids","This DVD is outdated, poor quality and definitely overpriced. It would have been nice to know it had video of 3 types of animals mating before I bought it. Luckily I watched it by myself before I showed it in my classroom. The content was limited considering the large title of ""Rain Forest"". Surely there is a more current DVD available on Amazon to show my students!"
4,This Book is a Great Idea!,"Understanding Love: Marriage, Still a Great Idea is a powerful book for anyone who is looking to get married, already married, or been married. Dr. Munroe was truly guided by the Holy Spirit when he penned this book!Unfortunately, I do know that Dr. Munroe is a Word of Faith teacher, whose theology I can not endorse. I do believe men who adhere to false teachings can still be men of God and extremely useful to the Lord's glory. This is why I do recommend this particular book.Understanding Love: Marriage, Still a Great Idea is a practical guide through what marriage is in this world and in God's eyes. In this book, Dr. Munroe uses essential Christian doctrine to support the entire book. Too bad he can't stick to the essentials in other areas of his ministry.I think this is one of the best Christian books on marriage in the market. I HIGHLY recommend it! Just be careful with other teachings of Dr. Munroe. Use discernment! For this reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars!"
3,EXCERPTS FROM KIERKEGAARD'S JOURNALS AND PAPERS,"Sren KierkegaardPapers and Journals: A Selectionselected and translated by Alastair Hannay(Hamondsworth, UK: Penguin Books, 1996) 683 pages(ISBN: 0-14-044589-7; paperback)(Library of Congress call number: )Several different selections from SK's journals and papersare available in English,even a few (like this one) that attempt to condensethe many volumes Kierkegaard left at his death into just one volume.Alastair Hannay has chosen to focus on the events of SK's lifein preparing this volume.(Other selections focus on his philosophy.)Because of this biographical focus,these selections are organized chronologicallyinto 7 phases of Sren Kierkegaard's life.I recommend reading this selection alongside a biography of SK's life,such as the one by Hannay himself.James Leonard Park, existential philosopher."
1,never recieved,"Was sent the wrong game sent it back to recieve right one then recieved wrong one again, sent that one back then never got credited until I called, then they credited. Very dissapointed"
5,Murder Mystery,"An intriguing mystrey novel that will keep you wondering all the way through,who is the drug lord/murderer,who is helping him,and who can,in fact,be trusted????"
4,OKAY BOOK,This book was great except it's ending was predictable. I wouldn't recommend this book if you are an avid mystery reader.
2,Murder on the Line,"Here we see a classic of the Sweet Valley sucky writing, predictable plotline, etc. The murder mystery, not so much a mystery as a blaring, flashing ""HE DID IT"" sign. So many unrealistic situations, it makes your head hurt. It even gets preachy about drugs. We get that Elizabeth is a goody-two-shoes, but really, two paragraphs directly out of a health textbook about why drugs are harmful? That's overdoing it. Everything is neatly tied up as usual (no continuity) the end.I don't hate the series. I was a fan for quite some time (so much so that I went through every book), but for the most part, the stand-alones, the ones that don't have a continuous plot, are horribly unbearable.Rating: 2/5"
4,"Great, but short","I'm a big fan of the Nancy Drew mystery games and Nancy Drew and the Haunted Carousel doesn't disappoint. Well, maybe a little. The story is good, game play is simple, but its too short. I got maybe 6 hours of game play out of it. If you're looking for a challenging adventure game, pass this up. If you're looking for a fun, easy, quick adventure, than this if for you. Perfect for kids."
2,"Too quick, too easy, too disappointed","My sister and I waited and waited for this game to come out.We loved the Nancy Drew series and enjoyed playing the others.But when we finally were able to buy this game we finished in it in less than two days. It was extremely easy and the game world was small and condensed.The story line was cute and the dialogue was good, but the amount of exploring and discovering of the game was rather poor. It was a good game for younger detectives, but it was way too easy for us older kids and I hope that the next games are made longer."
4,Nancy Does It Again!,"Once again, this is another one of the better Nancy Drew games. This one might be a little bit too easy or maybe just to some of us. It was really hard to guess who the culprit was this time. I didn't hate ANYONE because they were all pretty cool. The new added feature this time is a cell phone! Nancy receives calls while she's out and about and she can make phone calls anywhere she wants! It's not extremely spooky so you don't have to get too scared about it. It's not really scary at all. Just a little. This one was one of my 2 favorite Nancy Drew games! I definitely think you should buy this one. Oh and I saw a review that was labeled ""Too Fast"". I didn't read the review but I think that this game did go a little too fast. I mean not too fast for you to follow but you finish it too fast. I finished it in 2 days! The first Nancy Drew game I finished took me 7 days! Big difference. Nevertheless, this one was FUN!"
1,good enough just to earn a star,"I was slightly disappointed in this game. Why? Well it was extremely short. Also, there weren't that many puzzles, as if Herinteractive is running out of ideas. I wish I could of sleuth around some more, there were so many places that we could of sleuth at. There were a lot of bugs in this game and now my computer is fool of patches that I loaded from Herinteractive. There were so many bugs, that I could hardly play the game. Next time, I think Herinteractive should spend a bit more time checking out for the glitches and all. But I got over that.The characters weren't as fun as they are in the other games.I wasted twenty dollars on a game that took me a day to beat.If you are really looking foward to spend twenty dollars, I wouldn't waste my money.. It was so easy. Almost too easy. Herinteractive makes very good games, but this one, wasn't as good as the others."
3,"Great quick game, but somewhat disappointing","We love the Nancy Drew game series and find it a great way to challenge, empower, and educate young people, but this long awaited installment just didn't reach the level of previous games. We were able to complete gameplay in less than 3 hours, which is disappointing as we were looking forward to this game for some time. Some superb new elements have been added (such as a cell phone, e-mail hints, interesting riddles, and more interactive 'hotel room'), but overall not as educational (as say Scarlet Hand which was one of the best in terms of education)or satisfying as it should have been. Still looking forward to the next installment --- hope it retains some of the better aspects of previous games and loses some of the weaker aspects of this one. Overall, we were disappointed, but hopeful for the next one."
5,Fantastic,This is one of the best Nancy Drew computer games. It keeps you interested and at the end you're begging for more.
2,BORING,"I have played all of the Nancy Drew games, and ecxept for Secrets Can Kill, I enjoyed all of them. When I bought The Haunted Carousel I thought it was going to be as good as the best of them. I was very dissapointed. It was very short, very easy and you didn't have to snoop at all. The puzzles were very easy and the new computer feature helps you out too much. In conclusion I felt like this game was a waste of money. I still feel like the best game was Treasure in a Royal Tower."
2,Carousel - Way too short and no puzzles!,"If you like the Nancy Drew game series (and I do), there are much better ones to get. There are almost no puzzles to solve and you don't get to go anywhere interesting. At all. A theme park haunted house? Great - lots of potential there! But enter it and all you get to see is a virtually empty room. And it's the same with the roller coaster. I kept thinking the game was going to ""open up"" to more detail and more places, but while I was waiting for this to happen I followed what I thought was a simple clue and suddenly found I had solved the whole thing. Seriously, I thought I'd missed half the game, but walkthroughs tell me differently.Don't waste your money."
2,Not Impressed,"I am a Nancy Drew game fan, but this one was a disappointment. The game was way easy and lacked many of the hallmarks of ND games. For example, Nancy no longer has an alarm clock to go from day to night. Therefore, the gamer is forced to ""sneak around"" while people are still their offices. The amusement park has a map and you just click where you want to go. No more fun wandering around... There's loads of people to you need to call to give you answers you need instead of doing the research yourself. And the topper: there are very few ""hot"" items to pick up. Not once did I get nervous or worried and the ending was anti-climatic. I think that herinteractive should stick with what worked before. This one is way too dumbed down."
2,Disappointing Carousel Ride,"I wish we had read a review of this game before we had purchased it. Having purchased and played all preceeding Nancy Drew games with my children (where we were very satisfied and impressed with the quality) the Haunted Carousel was a noticeable letdown. Each game claims a minimum of 20 hours playing time and we have found this to be true with the exception of Carousel, which we finished in under 6 hours, at the highest difficulty level. The game contains far fewer problem solving opportunities and too much ""help"". You can't even wander through the park. I would suggest it only if it's hugely discounted as it is only about one third the playing time and quality level as other games in the Nancy Drew series."
2,Disappointed,"I have all the Nancy Drew mysteries...they are wonderfull.Which is why I'm so disappointed with this one in particular (The Haunted Carousel) It does'nt live up it its name, its as if they just whipped this out and depended on its name to sell it. Instead of 20 hours of game play, it should read 4+ hours and 10 and under intstead of 10 and over. Its too simple on senior (can't imagine what its like on junior) ..not at all like its thought provoking predecessors, there is'nt any depth to the plot. What happened to the sluething?"
5,Great!,The best one I've solved! I was sad when it ended. And I suddenly realised how much I loved carousel horses! I'm eager to do another!
5,Haunted Carousel Rocks !!,"A very creative plot !! The clues fall right in line with the storey making it a simplier game to play but a really fun game. I thought this was a very creative way of piecing together the clues. Miles the robot was delightful and fun to follow his clues. More interactive things like computor games, playing the midway games and ordering food added a lot of fun to the game. Even if you are a #1 sleuth at Nancy Drew this game is worth playing. It was creative and takes thinking ahead to another level."
5,cool new nancy!,"this game is really cool! i liked riding the carousel, except when i fell of! iv'e played these other nancy drew games:1.secrets can kill2.stay tuned for danger3.message in a haunted mansion4.treasure in the royal tower5.the final scene6.the haunted carouseli'm quite good at these, actually!my fave was probaly this one,maybe,i cant choose!"
2,not as challenging,I've played all of the Nancy Drew games and found this one to be too easy. My daughter found it a little boring (except for the ending). I would get this as a starter game. If you are a veteran of these games I 'd suggest that you wait until it's on sale.
3,The Least of Nancy Drew,"The game is easily the least challenging of the Nancy Drew games (best were Scarlet Hand, Treasure in the Royal Tower, The Final Scene and Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake). The puzzles are too few and too easy, and basically you just wait until a clue or necessary game piece is given to you instead of having to really figure out where to look for it. The ending is a REAL disappointment, especially compared with the more exciting endings of earlier games. And Bess obsessing over Matt calling her is SOOOO lame. Best features are Nancy's new cell phone and the To Do list that can be checked off."
2,Nancy Drew Haunted Carousel,"The Haunted Carousel game was a big disappointment to me for several reasons. I am a fan of the Nancy Drew software and only have good things to say about the *other* titles in this series by Her Interactive. That said, this particular game is too short, has fewer clues and puzzles (which are much too easy), other characters are barely fleshed out, and overall, it lacks any sense of mystery or intrigue basic to this type of game. I suspect that HerInteractive was in a crunch to get Danger on Deception Island out quickly in time for Xmas, and so they skimped on this particular game. I do not recommend it at all!"
2,The worst game in the series,"I was excited about getting ""The Haunted Carousel"" when i orderd it.What a let down.This is by far the most boring game in the series.Its way to easy.Plus you are limited by where you can go.This is a major step back to the quality of the first game in the series.Cheap and fast way of making Herinteractive a quick buck.They just threw this together.I hope future games,they take the time to really think things through."
4,Product Review,"This product came fast and was in prefect new, sealed condition!!Much better than other products i have ordered."
4,Too Quick,We love the Nancy Drew series and look forward to each new installment. We thoroughly enjoyed the Haunted Carousel but were very disappointed when we finished it in under four hours. It didn't seem to have nearly the depth of the others in the series.
4,Short Fun,"This Nancy Drew Game, the Haunted Carousel was very exciting and I couldn't wait for it to come out. Three hours of game time, and I was done. I had solved the case, but not in the 25+ game time garunteed. I would have given it five stars, but it being so short I took off one star. I thought the characters were fun and some parts were really challenging such as using the lathe. My favorite characters were Joy and Miles, the riddles were great. I didn't really like how the cell phone would ring and naturally pop up, because sometimes it was in the middle of when I was planning to do something important. Overall though, it was a very fun game!!! I cannot wait until Danger on Deception Island. It sounds great and is coming as soon as October of this year!"
2,Solved in 4 hours,"Okay...so maybe I didn't quite solve it in just 4 hours. I spent four hours trying to defeat the Barnicle Blast mini-game to get a Harmonica I needed. (Imagine the old game ""PONG"".) Finally I turned it over to a 12 year old who beat the mini game in 2 minutes allowing me to go on with life. Other then that, I would have solved it in 4 hours. It's not a long game. The sets are pretty but the puzzles are easy. You do get food (always a favorite in my book) but the only ride you will ride is the carousel. You do get to play the midway games as much as your like. You also get to learn shorthand and the history of carousels (fun little trivia to carry in the back of your mind). So I guess my final thoughts would be that this game was really fun while it lasted... but it doesn't last long."
5,The Haunted Carousel Nancy Drew cd game,"If there's ever a game one can learn while playing, it's the Haunted Carousel. As a kid you ride the merry go round spying the nicest looking horse you hope to get when finally on the platform. This game offers so much information about the origin of the horses being built, seeing interior room where the internal workings of the mechanisms are that makes the carousel such an attraction. Learning about the music rolls and playing a game while riding it too is fun. Kids love amusement park entertainment and one can't go wrong with this action packed game. If you're an adult, you reminisce on those enjoyable memories while gaining clues and solving the crime."
4,Not the best,"This Nancy Drew game was fun, but not fun enough. It only took a few hours to finish. There was not much to explore, and the games weren't exactly genius. But i still had a good time playing it. Just don't forget to turn off the iron!!! :)"
3,Good Historical Details,"I purchased this book as a Kindle book because it wasn't available through the library or any other means. It was expensive for a digital book so it was an indulgence. I was disappointed that most of the included images were not available in the digital version which made no sense to me. If I had known this beforehand I probably wouldn't have bought it for Kindle. We should have had easier access to the pictures than the print version had plus it wasn't much less expensive than the print version $19 for the print version versus $16.80 for the digital. Most of the other reviews said it was an easy read. I found that I had to plow my way through it a chapter at a time. That being said, it was interesting and the author certainly had done an amazing job with research."
1,Terrible Editing for the Kindle,"I was extremely disappointed to have spent so much money on a Kindle book only to receive a book with the worst editing job I have ever seen. As one reviewer mentioned, whole sentence groups are repeated in different parts of the text. In addition, there are many sections where the Kindle version cuts off mid-sentence, moves to a later paragraph, and then picks up the original content later on. I wish it were possible to return this like a real book."
1,Poorly written nonsense,"If Ms. Bryan is a British barrister, she needs to stay with a subject she knows something about. Her style is stuffy, her anecdotes trivial and her research specious. Some of her conclusions about slavery reek of the current fetish for historical revisionism among the fashionable left. If you are an off-the-wall feminist, this book is for you. The rest of us can wait for something a bit more sensible and balanced."
1,Boring,"This thing reads like a college dissertation. And calling George Washington a ""good old boy""? Horrors. If you can fight your way to the end of this one, you've got more patience than me. And people who know me say I am VERY patient."
3,mob figaz 2nd album,the album to me is short. i was expecting more tracks and better beats . i know they can come sicker. they got killa tay on here and cormega out the cuts cuz cormega from east coast. regardless of the fact that the album is short the figaz are sick. cant wait for the 3rd album yadadameen
1,Don't Bother,I've tried to get this thing to work several times but it seems as soon as the water pressure is strong enough to make a decent shower it forces the whole thing off the facet. You can get a better shower from a watering can. Don't waste your money.
2,Not good fit,"I purchased this to use on my bath tub to wash my dogs. When you turn on the water, the pressure makes it pop off. I use it but have to tape it on so it doesnt come off."
3,Needs a bit of work,"The fitting works, but needs something to help it stay in place. As long as you use cold water, you are golden. You make the water warm though and the fitting begins to soften and then fall off."
1,AWFUL!!!,This did not work on either of my faucets. It is hard and cheap feeling. I will just have to throw it away.
1,Not satisfied,This item should not be sold in modern times. I bought item to wash my daughter's hair. I settled for the wrong product
1,bath spray,Not a good product. Will not stay on the faucet from the way it is designed to fit. Got so frustrated with it that I threw it away!!!!!!!
1,not like my last one....,not like my last one.. not really happy. wish I ordered the more expensive one. you get what you pay for...
3,functional,"Works well. Adapter did not fit our shower pipe, so we had to modify. we use it to wash our shower."
1,Waste Of Money,"Does NOT fit all standard shower faucets. As others have noted, it does not fit properly over square faucets. Leaks like crazy and falls off after slight water pressure builds up. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
3,Good addition to our wash room sink.,"It was a good addition to our sink next to the washer and dryer. However, having it less than a year, the shower head snapped off from the tube. Perhaps I was holding too tightly, but I still believe it's not well made."
1,Not worth it,"I usually don't write reviews, I think that even the lowest quality and poor inspirational books could worth something but just for this time I don't want that someone else buy this book without knowing what is inside. Is just a lot of useless gray scale squares, with no design idea at all. Nothing usefull not even for beginners, a graphic designer mind must be a lot more creative than what is inside the book. If you still want to spend 10 bucks or less for this one, do it, but expect nothing."
5,Great way jump-start your ideas!,"I almost didn't buy this book because of the mixed reviews. After flipping through it in the bookstore, I purchased it. I'm so glad I did!Seems to me the negative reviewers here are not rating it well because they expected it to go beyond it's intended scope. The book clearly states up front that it provides various layout options, to be used as-is or to mix and match. It's purpose is to jump-start your creativity when your in a rut, not tell you exactly what to do with your content or cover layout theory. It is a reference of visual layout ideas. There are no lengthy explanations.Overall, great buy. I love it!"
2,Disappointing. Need ideas? Get them somewhere else!,"O.K. I was not expecting an in-depth graphic design book. What I was looking for (and couldn't find) was a source of inspiration. This book supposedly gives you ideas to quickly incorporate them in your design tasks. ""Mix & Match""... yeah right! Of course you'll find many useful ideas, but some of the examples shown in the book (most of them as a matter of fact) are either obvious examples of basic design or just repetitive.If you want a source of inspiration, a place where you really grab an idea from here, a concept from there and beauty and awe from somewhere else, you should buy a design annual. A book with real examples where you can also ""mix & match"" various ingenious and downright amazing ideas... (or get a Muse!)"
5,must have for graphic design students,"I bought this book for my daughter, a graphic design student. She had borrowed it from a local library and said it was a ""must have"" that contained a wealth of knowledge and ideas. The service from Amazon was simply outstanding and my daughter was thrilled with her surprise!"
4,Hundreds of layouts for the creatively stumped,"When you first thumb through the book, it seems somewhat corny. The illustrations look deceptively simple and boring. Once you really sit down and pour over the pages, however, you really start to absorb how useful these layouts are.Mixing and matching the components will guarantee that you will never have another boring brochure or newsletter. The designs can also get your brain churning in the direction of a better logo design and a definite help in business card design.The book's stiff spine and short page width means page turning requires two hands and you can't lay this book flat to study designs - a definite failing in a book of this type. In spite of this, it is still an essential to have in your creative library."
1,Not worth it!,"Not worth itIs VERY general, no meaningful text, the entire book is ONLY about redundant and basic examples of layouts, you can easily live without it!Don't buy it!!"
1,A BIG collection of lay-outs,"The book is almost what the title says: a Cookbook. It is full of sketched 'recepies' of layouts (most of them mediocre), almost no text, organized in categories.If it really were a Cookbook, you would have some text, explaining a bit more thoroughly what you could do with the idea presented.It's a book you learn very little from - you are expected to apply what is presented. The book laid in a very arid manner, being plainly dull at some points. I did not like it at all.If you're looking for a real Cookbook, get Jim Krause's 'Idea Index'! It not only gives you the ideas, but also has 'suggested serving variations', so you can spice-up the concepts presented."
2,Nice Book if you know nothing about design,"I think this book is for people that don't have any experience on graphic design whatsoever. It doesn't explain a thing about layout, why to use this or that layout, what that layout represents, etc... It's just blank pages with variations of the same concept. Though to be fair the book can start a tiny little spark here and then.The only thing I was surprised of was the quality of the paper used. My advice to the publisher: invest more in the content (or invest at all, maybe some text or explanation would be nice) and less in the stock paper.If you are looking for a nice book about layout I strongly recommend you buy Jim Krause: 'Layout Index' (That or any from the ""Index"" collection)"
2,Collection of layouts,"I knew what I was buying when I purchased this book - a collection of layouts. However, as an aspiring graphic designer I haven't really found the book of much use. When you design, you need to have the content first, and the book doesn't acknowledge this. It achieves what its title promises - ""recipes for faster... layouts"". Whether they are better is debatable. Indeed, it is an eye opener, but there is more to good designs than merely aesthetics and cookie-cutter layouts."
1,Graphic Design Cookbook,It's page after page of design templates - templates you'd have to build from scratch because they're only on paper - with NO explanation of what they are or are meant to accomplish. I returned the book the day I received it.
1,It's no more than a clipart collection,It's no more than the print out of a clipart/styles/templates/borders collection and other amenities that you can find in any Office-Automation-Software application. EXTREMELY POOR
2,I should've read the other reviews.,"This book is terrible. After reading several bad reviews that this book had received, I decided to buy this book anyway. I thought it might be nice to have around on days when I was feeling lazy or uninspire. Wrong. The designs is this book are so basic. There was nothing in there that was new to me or cutting edge. I did not feel inspired, in fact I thought a lot of the layouts and designs in the book seemed dated. This book would be perfect for aomeone who doesn't know a thing about design and doesn't plan on making this their profession. If you are a designer, save your money and buy yourself a book that will inspire you."
1,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a book full of color pictures with new, cutting-edge design ideas. Instead it reminds me of the back of some clip art book, where it shows small 1.5 inch square pictures of design ideas. The ideas, if you can call them that, are extremely basic and out-dated. The book is structured into five sections: Structuring Space, Orienting on the Page, Text Systems, Ordering Information, and Pictoral Considerations. While there are a few ideas, most I wouldn't use, especially since I am more into web design. I would not recommend this book and wish I would have spent the money elsewhere."
1,HUGE Disappointment,"This book is filled with nothing more than frivolous and useless fluff (I simply will not refer to them as ""ideas""). For example, putting a detective hat atop an ""R"" and turning its serif into a pipe is downright childish. Seriously, any good designer or anyone with common sense would steer clear of this visually-horrifying garbage. If you are at all serious about design, pick up any/all of the Jim Krause books. This one's going to the next library book sale."
4,Really helpful for tired brains,I'm so glad I bought this book. I've been having some really tired/lazy/fallow periods of staring at the blank pages and just not knowing how to get started. It's great to see an element that fires my imagination and gets the process rolling. Just use this book as an idea-starter!
3,meh,"It's OK... there are some ideas in there, but nothing that's really new and exciting. A lot of the stuff looks like templates from Word's document set up. Kind of cheesy. I guess if you're going for low end graphic design for flyers and such, this would work. But not if you're looking for something that's going to ""wow"" people."
3,Should Have Stayed With No Limit,"It Was Ok. I Wouldn,t Reccomend it unles u r a big magic fan and have to have it,like i am a big magic fan,but was a dissapointment,with 21 songs including skits which was 2 many of them,it only clocked in at about 54 mins. it made me wonder at times when he was with no limit did magic write his material or did c and the no limit family write it? it does have a few good bangers on it though."
3,He left the Tank.............May God help his career,"For anyone who knows their No Limit history, Magic was the first (and only) person signed to TRU Records in division with No Limit/Priority. I guess when C-Murder (TRU Records CEO) went to prison for Murder 1 (see the irony?) The label folded. That leaves Magic with No Limit. Now he's on an Independant no named label. This is by far the worst Magic album. In fact Magic has gotten worse with each album he releases! The only bright spot on this album is ""Wylin"". Please steer clear of this hazard!"
3,Good Sound!,"It's not the best stopping mute you will ever see, but it provides a good sound, tune and good deal for the price."
4,It Works Well For Me.,"I haven't used the ""Floppy"" Drive that much but it seems to work O.K. I bought it to eventually copy my photos on my old ""floppies"" to CD's or DVD's. My old floppies are starting to degrade to the point that only about 50% of the photos are still viable. I think that it is a good investment and was pleased to find it on my favorite on-line store, Amazon.com."
3,A Computer User,"Buyers beware this drive has an extremely short cable, and (Mac users) you can't just plug it in the keyboard hub it needs a AC powered hub."
4,usb cord included!,"This drive is compact and works well, but be aware that it INCLUDES a USB connection cord. I presumed that it didn't and ordered the ""better together"" USB a/b cord to go with it that amazon recommends. Of course, I don't need the extra cord and now I have to pay shipping to return it!"
1,Quality Control,I have had the floppy drive since November 2009 and have had to use it about five times. Initially it performed well. After a couple of usages the computer wouldn't recognize it. I have not been able to use it since. How do I return the floppy drive? I would not recommend the product to anyone.
5,Great Little Helper,"This little floppy drive is a joy to use. With most computers now being shipped without floppy drives, I was using too many CD's for the smallest chores. Now with the floppies at my fingertips I can backup small files with no effort at all. AND I can change the information on them instantly. I recommend this drive very highly."
5,Works fine,"I have used the drive for over a year now, and it works fine. I place it on top of my tower-type computer. The 24"" cord is ample to connect to the plug in the back of the computer."
3,...the SmartDisk website and support for it's drivers no longer exist??!?,"The product works great on my Mac and newer Windows machines, but I bought this device specifically for use in virtual machines of older Windows environments, like 98 or ME. Being that the SmartDisk website and support for it's drivers no longer exist, I'm forced to make images of each disk before I can load them into a virtual machine. Several steps more than I would expect."
4,Does The Job,"This little drive isn't the cheapest, but it works well - and fast - under both Windows and Mac OS. However, a couple of minor FYIs before you buy: 1)It needs a powered USB port, so you'll have to plug it directly into the computer or a powered hub. 2)The photo gives the impression that it is a slick-looking metallic white when actually it's more of a rough putty gray."
2,"Worked well for 100 disks, then died completely","This floppy drive (model FDUSB-TM2) worked wonderfully for a while.It read 720kB floppies and 1.4MB floppies. (but not 800kB old-mac floppies - try eBay for that)It was recognized and worked fine with Windows (XP2), Mac (OSX 10.5 Tiger), Linux (Ubuntu 9.10)I was very pleased with it, for about 6 months and 100 floppies.Then it made loud crunching noises, and stopped working at all.Now it won't read any floppies on any Operating System.The included warranty info has no phone number, and directs me to a dead website ([...])"
3,SmartDisk FDUSB-TM2 USB External Floppy Drive,"I bought this floppy drive in July 2005 for around $27 from Amazon. I was delighted with it since it seemed to be fairly priced and turned out to be simple to use (plug n play). After a year and a half of use, it fizzled out. When I go to copy onto the floppy, it says that it's unable to write onto the floppy because the floppy is in read position (BUT IT'S NOT). I didn't even use it that much except to back up my data files from an older version of Quicken which only allows you to back up to floppies. I'm disappointed that it didn't last longer. Maybe I just got a bad one, but I liked it enough that I'm going to replace it with the same thing. If it wears out again sooner than I think it should last, that'll be it for me and this brand."
3,Ejection problem,"Does what you would expect a floppy drive to do with one exception: the floppy disk is difficult to remove. It doesn't really EJECT. In fact, it hardly budges when the eject button is pressed. I have to DIG IT OUT of the drive. Tweezers are handy as are long fingernails. Since it is only an occasional-use appliance, I can live with this. There is a certain security in knowing that one can read and write floppy disks and this unit provides that security. If I have to use it a lot, this drawback could be a significant problem."
5,SmartDisk External floppy drive,Easy to install -- easy to use. I bought this drive to augment the ones on my e-machine. It is used primarily for processing photo images from my Sony 1.2 Mavica and has done an excellent job in that regard.
2,Does not boot in Firewire mode on OSX,"I have bought this drive before because it is well made, quiet and sleeps automatically. Buying this drive for a friend to act as a new boot drive I found out that this drive does not boot in Firewire mode on OSX. I found other reviews after digging around some more. I am dissatisfied with the WD for not pointing this out!"
5,Fabulous Floppy Drive,"Excellent product. Easy to use. I needed to get old files off my windows 98 system onto my new vista system. no cd burner on old computer. just a floppy drive. no floppy drive in the new computer. what to do?? Get on Amazon, get the smartdisk titanium external floppy drive. SUCCESS!Thank you"
5,easy to use & like,"Bought this to retrieve some old school papers and documents, and works like a charm. Great to be able to access old files on floppy disk and eventually transfer them hard drive."
5,Smartdisk floppy drive,This product arrived in 3 days. I've used it to move files from one computer to a new one and to load old programs onto new computer. Works just fine. Quick and no problems with it showing up as a drive on either computer.
5,Andrew Fuller Unveiled,"Somehow over the years, Andrew Fuller has gotten an undeserved reputation as the man who saved the Particular Baptists in the Eighteenth century from the dreaded clutches of ""Hyper Calvinism"" as personified by John Gill. The truth of the matter is that Fuller, using a popular methodology, actually introduced Arminianism into a previously orthodox denomination. Gill, as Dr. Ella shows in his book on him,""John Gill and the Cause of God and Truth"" was not at all the ""hyper-calvinist"" of popular repute. Fuller appears orthodox because he uses orthodox terminology, but defines the terms in new ways, much like Dave Hunt and Normon Geisler in their deceptive,recently published attacks on orthodox Calvinism. Dr. Ella shows how Fuller used this tactic to introduce foreign ideas into the Baptist denomination and partially caused it's decline in orthodoxy and eventually brought about the ""Down Grade"" controversy a centry later."
1,USB Connector Falls Off,"I bought this particular drive (4 gig version, back when the price was higher) because it appeared to have a solid build and I liked the soft, ""easy grip"" exterior. The drive worked fine, but after about 6 months of light use and careful handling, the USB connector came loose and fell off. I tried to reseat it, but no go.Also, I think all such drives ought to have a capless design, or at least have the cap fit the end, like a pen cap does. I've also seen some that are tied to the device. A cap is just too easy to lose. However, I must admit--leaving the cap in a visible location helped me to not forget and leave the drive in my school computer."
3,Speed lower than expected,"I got this to run virtual machines from as my laptop has a 64 gb solid state disk, i needed the extra space and thought i'd perform sort of similar speedwise - mistake - it is way slower for constant access than a usb hard drive."
1,Not Reliable,The product failed on me only after having it for 3 months. Corsair customer service has been slow to send me a new one. Not worth the hassle of paying for shipping and being out of a drive for such a long time. Go with some other manufacturer. The rubber is unnecessary and makes it hard to connect. I end up leaving the dongle on it so my drive has essentially doubled in size.
1,Not a quality product,"I have had this since end of November 2007. It's Feb 2008 and the thing won't work anymore. I have to ""bend"" the end to make it connect. Seems like it has a short in it. I believe it is caused by being enclosed in a rubber sleeve instead of a hard plastic sleeve that is covered by rubber. The internals just don't seem to be well protected.Amazon return policy was up at the end of January so I'm stuck with this junk."
1,Did not last long!,I purchased this item from another online vendor at Christmas this past year and it has now failed. It is not recognized by any computer I plug it in and I have tried six. Corsair gave me an RMA to have item replaced but I am better off smashing it with a hammer and buying another brand.
4,Good drive for the price,Good drive for the price but little bit slower than my other drives (Cruzer and Kingston).
3,"massive, well cushioned, sadly lanyardless","This thing is capacious, cheap and well-cushioned with a durable rubber cover. That's good. But every thumb drive should have both a lanyard and some means of affixing the cap to the main body so it doesn't get lost. This has neither."
5,Corsair 16GB,Works great so far...wish write speed was a little better. Plenty-O-space for all my stuff.
1,Tortoise among flash drives,"I hate this drive because its pathetically slow. Read speeds are < 10MBps and Write speeds are between 1-5 MBps even though other competitors to this drive have over two to three times the data transfer speed of this one.I like it because it is a very safe drive - the rubber cover protects it a lot and even though I use it pretty roughly, it stays safe from vibration, dropping, water etc.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It is a portable drive for sure but Corsair really screwed up the speed on this drive making it probably the slowest USB drive I have ever used. Even memory cards run faster than this. And don't bother trying to get it replaced from Corsairbecause from all the forum posts I read on their support website, everyone mentioned that the replacement drive is even slower.Please don't buy this drive. I would give it away for a couple of bucks (heck, even free) if someone is in real need of a thumbdrive cos I can't stand the speed on this one."
4,Decent buy,"This is a decent drive and is reasonably fast for documents interchange.I use it primarily to exchange data between my windows machine at work and linux machine at home. It works ""out of the box"" on both operating systems.I have not owned it for more then 2 weeks now, so cant say about long term guarantee - but its been working like a charm till now."
5,Flash Drive - Reliable!,We purchased 2 - 4GB about 3 years ago and each has wonderfully handled backing up our office files over and over again. So there was no question which Flash drive we would get when we needed to back up a much larger database. These are very quick and cost effective flash drives. I have been impressed with their reliablity and will definitely continue to buy Corsair Voyager Flash drives when I need additional or flexible memory.
2,Would return it if I could. Frustratingly slow,So much so that I decided to get on here to vent. I should have listened to the other reviewers who didn't give it 5 stars......but alas I'm a little slow as well.
4,Good prodct but slower than advertised,I have the 2MB Voyager but needed more space. The 8MB device works fine but it has a 2-3MB/sec write rate - much slower than 12MB/sec advertised rate. Also the cap on the new unit was a bit loose. Overall it is a good and reliable product.
4,I'm Happy - But....,"I'm very happy with the product - But I was at first baffled by the encryption option, because I did not read anything about it being on there. I was not wanting or needing any encrytion. I have now bypassed this and am very happy and will be buying another one or two in the future."
3,Slow and overpriced but does the job,"This device is very very big, which was why I bought it. However, be warned... it's slow as molasses in January. Also, the price was very high. If you don't need such a large drive, I suggest waiting a few months until the prices come down."
1,Nice while it lasted,"The seller was great, and the flash drive was too. After about 10 months of moderate use it stopped working. Now I plug it into a USB port on my PC and nothing happens. I plug a different flash drive into the same port, and my PC recognizes it. I was using my large flash drive as a backup - bad idea. I'm using Carbonite now."
1,"DONT buy this flash drive, after 1 month it just died.","Don't buy this flash drive, after 1 month it just died on me. It will not activate on any computer, no light on the drive, no indication on the computer that a USB device was plugged in. It's simply dead weight. a real shame since i had all my passwords installed on there using roboform, and all the utilities i use to fix other peoples computer. Any ideas to recover files would be helpful... but be forewarned."
1,Failure on top of failure,"I really liked my 16G Flash Voyager when I first bought it in Dec 2007. In failed in August 2008. This cost me data, time, and postage to send it back. The replacement arrived but was MUCH slower than the original. It was so painfully slow that hardly used it. The replacement failed in July 2009. This cost me data, time, and postage to send it back. I won't bother with Corsair in the future."
2,"Cap fell off, Corsair doesn't reply to request for replacement","I purchased this product based, in part, on the glowing review at Amazon. I was particularly pleased to read ""And also this is one of the few USB devices that the cap stays on very tight."" When I received the drive, I put it on the lanyard and hung it around my neck. Within minutes, I felt something hit my foot -- it was the cap, which had fallen off by itself!On Monday (4/14) I e-mailed Customer Service at Corsair, saying the cap fell off and requesting a replacement. On Tuesday, two people read my e-mail (judging by the Read Receipts). To date, however, I have not heard from Corsair, nor have I received a replacement cap.The product seems to work well as a drive, but I am reluctant to use it much for fear that I will lose the cap (it really is loose!!). I may try e-mailing them again, but if they ignored me once, why should I think they'll notice me a second time?"
3,Slower Than Expected,"I was going to use this flash drive to put a virtual machine on so I could carry it between work and home. the device is way too slow to actually run a VM from. It works fine for file storage but don't even try using it for a ""live disk drive""."
5,I LOVE my Voyager!!,This is the best flash drive I have ever owned. It has a HUGE capacity and is very reliable. My first one broke when I had the lanyard attached while it was plugged into my notebook while I was riding the train. The lanyard got caught on something and when I moved I bent the part that connects into the notebook. Corsair promptly replaced the entire device without question (unfortunately my data was toast).
4,Good product,"The speeds for this flash drive are average. The rubber casing is OK, but the top can be easily lost."
4,Cosair 8GB Flash Drive,Drive is very fast when transfering large files. All in all I am very happy with this drive. I have owned several different brands and the corsair is one of the faster ones that I have owned.
4,satisfied,"With a 64GB capacity in early 2009, I knew I was getting an MLC flash device, and my performance expectations were conceived accordingly. Sure, you can get much faster SLC flash drives, at a fraction the capacity and with much lower space/$. I wrote about 45GB to mine, at an average rate of something like 10MB/s on a MacBook Pro, which was entirely reasonable. I suspect that many of those who complain of the write speed are comparing apples to oranges, or in this case, a large MLC device to a small SLC device. I also suspect that some have the mental idea that a flash drive should take N seconds/minutes to fill, without regard to the capacity difference. Perhaps there are applications for USB flash drives that require massive speed, but I'm currently not aware of any. Heck, if one needs any real speed by today's standards, the bottleneck of the USB interface alone disqualifies any such unit and a (smaller, SLC) class 6 SDHC/CF card with a FireWire reader is a much better option."
3,"Replacement was faster, but re-write is pretty slow.","Original: I needed the size so I have kept it. I think there is a defect in it that makes it run at USB 1.1 speeds. I have no problem with the other keys that I have. I would suggest trying a different product.UPDATE: The company sent a replacement that is much faster. However, write speeds are still very slow when re-writing. This is understandable given the technology. However, the SanDisk 64GB flash drive I have is much more responsive."
4,8GB USB Thumb Drive/Flash Drive,"Bought this item in January of 2009. It is now the month of March. When i bought this thumb drive, it was the cheapest on with free DLV. A couple weeks later, I get an email of products I may be interested in. I see another thumb drive from SD 8GB for $20 and freee shipping. I felt down that an 8GB can be alot cheaper. That is why i rated this item 4/5 stars. It would be 5 stars if the price was really good. Works fine, rubber coat. Price is still the same and could be alot cheaper. I have never heard of this branch which i would of thought I got a good deal. But a Great product"
2,Not as great as advertised,"The one good thing I have to say about this drive is that it's relatively fast at reading/writing. However, it's not even close to the advertised 16Gb of storage space. It's common for that number to be off a little on all storage drives, but this one only has 12.2Gb of space available. Almost 4Gb is NOT a little bit. That's a fourth of the advertised memory that isn't there! Since I had to use this for a OS recovery backup for my laptop which required 11.8Gb of space, I had barely enough room for it! Corsair/Amazon needs to point this out for customers who actually need the space advertised. Otherwise, you'll be in for the same surprise as me!"
2,Breaks over extended use,"My Corsair drive actually physically broke after using it for about a year. I used it often but fairly carefully, so - be warned! Now mine is unusable and I'm just hoping that everything on there is backed up . . ."
4,A Great Flash Drive,"I find the Corsair 4G Flash Drive to be very fast and reliable. I love the neck-strap and rubberized container.BAD: The only bad thing I can think of is that the small cover over the USB connector is easy to lose (and being a small black object, hard to find. How about a nylon string tying cover to body so it can't get lost."
4,Excellent Value,This is a very good Value on this product priced much lower than competersand i found no difference in preformance.
5,"Using for Xbox, works great!","Bought this as extra memory for my roomie's Xbox 360. Using one of the front USB ports, it was recognized immediately and formatted quickly. We then downloaded the Crysis 3 MP beta onto it and have been running it off of the drive ever since. It runs just as fast as the Xbox's hard drives for a fraction of the price, would definitely buy again!"
3,Not as fast as I expected.,The product pictures displayed speed tests outputting as much as 15 MB/s write and 30 MB/s read but in reality its just 7 MB/s write and 26 MB/s read. I wouldn't suggest the extra price for the little extra performance.
1,Horrible product,"I purchased this drive primarily to make portable the many projects and presentations that I collaborated with others students on in grad school. So I needed a reliable drive, which the reviews indicated this one was. It worked fairly well for a few months, but then the transfer speeds began slowing down more and more, and the amount of failed transfers began to increase. In the end, after less than one year of use, it stopped working all together. It would begin transferring files, but then fail at about 15-20 percent...every time. There were many times where it indicated that transfer was successful only to fail when I went to read the files on a different PC.It's also worth mentioning that even when this drive worked, it never achieved the advertised transfer speeds (all PCs used ran Windows 7). The best write speed I ever got was about 10-12 MB/sec, which is pathetic. And reads weren't much better.I do not recommend this product, especially if your data is critical."
1,Word of caution,"I gave one star mainly because the USB drive failed to function in less than a year after purchase. Also be aware that if you submit a case online (corsair website), they will replace it, but will NOT repair it.Update: I may have bad luck. This year the one that Corsair sent me broke down again. It simply didn't work. I brought me to data retrieval center; they couldn't retrieve data. Some company offered me about $1000 quote saying that there are too many bad sectors. I have used many thumb drives for the last ten years, and Corsair turned out to be the only one that broke down once and now twice."
4,Flawless but slow performance.,"The 8GB works without a hitch, but, I'm disappointed that it took nearly 15 minutes to transfer a 3GB file from my computer to the Voyager (about 3.3MB/sec)."
2,Worked great... suddenly died.,"I owned this flash drive for just about 7 months... it worked perfectly well, and then all of a sudden, the drive completely failed on me -- no computer will recognize it. Blah! =("
5,Great flash drive,"Unlike the other 16GB drive so called ""Samsong"" that I purchased and returned earlier this one works very well with no issues. It could have been made a little smaller but overall not an issue."
3,"Fine drive, but unreliable?","I purchased 12 of these drives for the office and three have gone belly up in the first three months of use. I sent one back and I'm waiting to here if they will replace it before sending the other two. I also bought a 16GB version which seems to be working fine. The three drives that went bad were being used by three different people on various machines, so I don't believe the users are at fault for the drive failures."
2,Poor Durability,Owned for 4 months. Performance great. USB connector just came off. Was only plugged into my computer or carried in my laptop bag. Problem seems to have been fatigue in the pins connecting the USB plug to the board. No apparent mechanical support beyond the unit's rubber boot. What a waste.
3,Second replacement just broke,"I generally love and trust Corsair to make good products (I use their memory, liquid cooling, and power supply) so I expected the same level of quality from this USB product...not the case.The first one went dead after just 2 weeks of use, sent back to Corsair (RMA process was painless and the people helpful), got my replacement back in 2 weeks, and it just went dead again 2 days ago. I don't have the patience to keep sending in replacements despite Corsair's generous RMA policy so I'll be looking around for another one soon.The problem stems from the rubber housing, it's just TOO flexible and thus it becomes very easy indeed to have the part bend or lose their connections inside the actual enclosure.It worked great until it didn't"
3,Rubber casing protector,"The ""Corsair 32GB Flash Voyager USB 2.0 Flash Drive CMFVYA32GB"" is a fine product except that the rubber casing protector collects too much lint if carried in your pocket."
4,good product,"It's actually a great product, the transmission of data goes to a reasonable speed compared to other brands. We placed four stars for that would be excellent if the pen drive to bring a hole or putting on hold a ribbon."
2,Flash drive may cease working...,"The general reviews for this device were positive and I read that Corsair flash drives were some of the best so I bought one back in November to use for my Xbox 360. It worked great until January when my data became corrupted and I had to reformat the drive. It started working again until a couple of weeks ago. This time, however, the device simply ceased working. I thought maybe it got corrupted again but when I plugged it into my computer it wouldn't register on it either. I tested plugging the device into my computer several times to make sure that it was not being recognized and sure enough, the flash drive wasn't recognized. As far as I'm concerned, this product is a piece of junk and I would HIGHLY recommend you avoid purchasing it. I hope this flash drive was a fluke but it seems like it's more of a trend."
2,Hard to fit into hub,"This drive is advertised as rugged and secure. I have no problem with that description. However, the rubber exterior is too chunky to allow the drive to plug into my computer's front usb socket. At the back, I had to remove several external devices to make room to plug this in. I can imagine people bending the connection to force it in. The cap could also be easily lost.The Data Traveller 16GB drive is easier to use."
2,No Luck...,"I actually got this one from a friend.He purchased it, then it died on him, then he sent it back and the replacement they sent died again in a few months. He sent it back again and gave the third replacement to me.I used it for two months and it stopped working. I sent it back again for a new one. Now it lies unused; I don't trust it.I have extensively used the 8G version of the product. It held up nicely for nearly three years. It seems the 16G version is failure prone.One star for such poor productOne additional star for good warranty."
3,Seems OK to me,"Well, it does what it's suppose to do.I would give it 5 stars except I'm so sorry I didn't check to see if it had a LED light to indicate when it's working. I just didn't think to check for that feature. I have it on all my others, and just took it for granted that it would be there. I won't make that mistake again. Though it seems to work fine, I sure miss that feature."
3,too fat,"I have no quality or reliablity issues with this drive. The only issue is, the body of it is somewhat fat, with the rubber housing, and it makes it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to insert other usb plugs next to it on a computer. I always worry about flexing the contacts of it or the other plug, and screwing something up.it feels substantial with the housing, but perhaps one side could be flatter."
4,Good Flash Drive,"This flash drive has a significant amount of space and is ""hardened"" against shock (rubberized coating). This also keeps it from getting a five star rating from me. It is a tad thick if you want to stack something else in a close USB port, but of course the coating which makes it thick also gives it protection, so it depends on what you are looking for. This is a good product."
2,Good build quality and very slow speeds,"The 16GB stick has enough space. However, I have been using this for 2 weeks and the speeds are very very crappy. Write speeds are some times < 1MB/s and read speed are 5MB/S. Dunno if all the pieces are this bad or I ended up with a lemon. Check out other models.Ths speeds mane this a NO BUY for me"
4,great for media transfers,"Works great, faster than the 4GB model. Keep the extension cord with you because it may be too fat to fit next to your other USB devices."
5,Terrific!,"I feel very happy with this product, it's versatile, portable, and I love its rubber case, very practical and functional."
5,Fantastic 8 GB...,"Ruggest, dependable, a perfect fit at a right price. The only complaint, and it's almost too small to mention is the rubberized housing does collect dust easily and it won't come off...but really who cares, it's functional, small, acurate! I'd buy another in a heartbeat."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"It's very cool that this flash drive is affordable and holds 16 gigs. I disregarded someone's review here that it is slow, and wish I didn't. It is really slow... I use it to hold a lot of documents and I compose word docs on it and save them there and every time I save during composition, it takes FOREVER.I would not buy this again for this purpose."
2,Undependable,"While Corsair certainly has excellent customer service, the 16GB Flash Voyager cannot be relied upon. I've had it replaced twice, but and the 3rd one just went belly up just like the first two. The first time I lost a few files with no backups. Since then I have never relied on it at all, and well for it. I have a 1GB SanDisk Cruzer from 100 years ago that has been accidentally washed twice and still works; my (3rd) Flash Voyager has been treated with extreme care and just suddenly stops working. For the price it's fine for what it does, just always remember DO NOT rely upon it to keep anything at all--not even for a few minutes. There's no telling when it will just fail. I'm not even going to bother trying to get it replaced again. More trouble than it's worth."
5,Superbly and uniquely designed flash drive,"Consist functionality, no failures yet. Strongest point is rubber housing - unique among flash drives, at least as far as I know."
3,Just another USB Drive,"It works pretty good, there's no tech issues with it, its really not anything special. All it has that makes it good is the case design, its flexible and very protected, but its also very ugly. I'm not into the yellow letters and there symbol on the cap."
2,Fast drive but may not be what you're looking for,"I just received the item and admittedly it is a faster USB memory stick than the Kingston I have. However, I bought this drive hoping to have an adequate keyring hook so it could be strung on my keyring as other memory sticks I have either don't have a hook or they break. The picture of the Corsair Voyager is deceiving and rather than a rock hard plastic or rubber exterior it is infact soft rubber and I don't feel confident that it will last too long on my keyring. Also the soft rubber exterior picks up fluff and dust very easily. The device might look good with your mountain bike but it doesn't seem as though the keyring hook at least might be as durable as it claims by just being in your pocket. Corsair do another memory stick with an aluminium casing and what looks like a sturdy keyring hook. I've placed an order for it but it has yet to arrive. We shall see."
3,Speed and transferablilty,"The speed is on the slower side of what I would have expected. Actually, as slow as my Lexar with which I am greatly disappointed. It seems to be running at USB 1.1 speed. Also, I could not get it to be recognzied on the front USB panel of a friend's computer also running XP Pro as I am. I believe that the rubber is so close that it did not allow full insertion, but this is only a guess."
5,better use,After buying this i found this is very good.But the MIR did not work for me.Thanks to amazon they have given me in lieu of the rebate from corsair
3,Not Reliable. It is corrupting file.,"Hi,I bought this useless CORSAIR 16GB for all my Mp3 songs. But what happening is that when I delete a bulk of MP3 songs (like 200MB to 500MB), it is corrupt the others songs. So when I hear other song is skipped and it is corrupted.My recommendation is it is not for reliable."
4,"good size, ok speed",I love the 64GB and if this was my first flash drive it would be perfect but having owned a 16GB flash voyager i find its speed to be a bit slow. If i could do it again i would get the Patriot Xporter Magnum 64GB.
2,"The good, the bad, the ugly",Good - large capacityBad - very very slow. 4 times slower than my 8G SandiskUgly - body is flexible and connector bends. Mine is broken already.
4,Great USB Flash Drive with Encryption,"I'm really happy with my new drive...lot's of storage space and it comes with arguebly the best encryption software. My only complaint is that I didn't realize how long it took to encrypt and tranfer files to the drive. It took over 4 hours to encrypt the whole flash drive and transfer 8GB of files over. It would take about 8 hours to transfer 16GB of files over to the drive. Not a big deal because I need to have good encryption...but it slows down you computer quite a bit while it's doing that. It wouldn't have been a deal breaker for me, but probably something you should know about before you buy. My computer is a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 with 1TB RAID hard drive set up and 4GB RAM...so I know that it's not the weak link."
4,It works!,"I needed to transfer files from my home computer to a lab computer, and I have to say, it does that just fine. No speed issues. No erased files.However it does lose a star because the rubber surroundings force you to use a usb extension. This become a problem when you're using a usb drive next to the one that you're plugging your flash drive into. It comes with the product but it's still a pain to carry it around with the flash drive.The rubber does have advantages though. It prevents it from randomly falling out of your pocket and it prevents the cap from falling off.Overall, I'm quite pleased with my purchase, and I'd recommend it to anyone purchasing one for themselves."
5,Very pleased.......,I bought this 8GB memory stick for my husband and he loves it. I was very pleased with the price and the quality. I would recommend this product.
4,Plenty of storage & durable,"This is a great little USB drive. 16GB is plenty of storage. I have many portable apps installed on this, and I still have a lot of storage left over.The rubber exterior makes the drive a bit more durable then other drives with a hard exterior. Because of the exterior, fitting other USB devices into the USB ports above for below this drive is a very tight squeeze. In cases like this, you are better off using the USB extension included with this.The last improvement I would make, would be to put a the cap on some sort of leash. After less than a month I have already lost mine!"
5,buy it! it does work with vista just fine by theway,i've used it for a few weeks now and haven't found any problems. it comes with software that didn't get in the way of anything. i didn't use it but there was no problem
2,Very Slow compared to previous drives,Very Slow compared to previous drives. I would not purchase this drive if you are planning to run programs from it. It is to slow.
3,"OK for the price, albeit slow write speed","16GB for $40 (plus a $15 rebate) made me buy this... I have about 12GB of files I need to backup and transport between computers (without wasting a CD due to frequent changes)Running XP the write speed is dismal... it took 12 hours to copy 12GB of files in a half dozen directories (Ok, folders... when I started they were called directories)I did have to change the format from FAT32 to NTFS due to one very large file... but 1GB per hour is simply a dismal write speedOf course, this thing IS a lot smaller than a USB hard drive (which copied the same directories and files in far less than an hour) and I'm not wasting a CD every time there is a data change... but the write speed is horribleBottom line is I will keep this because it IS very portable... but I won't buy another one"
2,Not as good as it seems,"I have to agree with many of the reviews here. After having tried many different USB flash memories, I have to say this one comes short of what I expected. I can name a few disappointing things:- bulky design- may be water resistant but it easily bent from the adapter and died, so it's not so rugged after all- compared to other flash memories it has SLOW performance, specially when transfering many small files. the slowest I've ever tried.- cap comes off easily"
4,Useful thing,"I like the space available it's great. What I had trouble from the beginning was that my computer couldn't read the Flash Drive. It hasn't happened with other Flsh drivers that I have used before. But now it's working ok, and it works good in all of my 3 USB ports."
1,Missing Shipment,This item was shipped on Dec 21st but has not arrived at the shipper UPS as of the 26th. There appears to be no method to contact Amazon concerning the missing shipment. The paperwork was submitted to UPS but the item did not make it to the shipper. It was to arrive on the 22nd. I have also been billed for the item.
3,It's Okay . .,"This is a very rugged USB Flash Drive. On the other hand, it is very bulky,and doesn't fit well in tight spots where there are other USB devices , like in the back of the computer.I didn't find this Flash Drive was particularly fast . . about average in that regard.In fact, the flash drive was so slow, that it can't be used for Vista Ready-Boost."
3,Corsair Flash Voyager 8 Gb,Purchased this for my son's use at school. First thing he asked me was where is the cord? USB drive does not come with a lanyard and the cap is easy to loose. Rubber padding makes this drive larger than most. Works well and happy with performance
1,Received the Corsair Flash drive not working at all,"Received the Corsair Flash drive not working at all, I was told by Amazon that I was unable to return the item because I was past the time period for a return. I had to order a new one from another company and it worked fine with no problems at all. I guess that it was just luck of the draw that I had gotten a bad one from Amazon."
5,Flash Drive,Great for backing up my computer and important files. Very easy to use and convienient. I am glad I bought it.
5,The case is great,"I had a 16GB just like this 32GB. I'm not gentle handling flash disks. Throw it around, keep it in my pocket with keys and change. The vinyl (rubber?) case protects it MUCH better than any plastic one I've owned. And the cover always stays in place. No more cheap Kingston or San Disk ones for me again."
5,Fast Drive!,"Got this drive from amazon pretty quick and I'm amazed! The drive is very fast. Did a speed test on winXP computer and I get about 30mb read and 13mb write, I'm impressed. Also comes with 10 year warranty which is great. The drive is also very solidly built maybe a little to thick, but not an issue for me. So far I've had no issues with the drive. Definitely recommended!"
5,great product,This is a great usb flash drive. I received the package quickly and it works great. It uploads fast and have no problems yet. It seems like it's very sturdy and i shouldn't have any problems with it. I'll write another review as soon as i do!!
5,The Best Portable Storage,"I have used the Voyager extensively. The read/write speeds are very fast. Its expected useful life may exceed the end of the universe. It seems indestructible. Just plug and go.Corsair CMFUSBSRVR-8GBGT 8GB GT Flash Voyager USB Flash DriveGetting extra end covers is suggested. A slightly longer extension cord would be nice.Finally, there is a reason the 8 GB model is generally out of stock (popularity)."
5,Went through the washer!!!!!!!!!!,"I've owned my Flash voyager for quite a while now and definitely have put it through the paces. The latest is that I actually left it in a pair of pants and then washed the pants! They also went in the dryer but without heat. I just plugged it in and not only does it work, but everything is there. Fantastic durability. Always works - easy plug and play - what else do you need?"
2,Bad cap design. I lost the cap after 3 months. Now the drive does not work any more because water got into it.,"I lost the cap after 3 months. Now the drive does not work any more beause water gets into it. Other than that, its price is very competitive. From now on, I'll buy capless USB flash drives only."
4,This thing is good,I got this one day after I ordered it. Great price for 4gb. The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is that dang package took so long to open. I had to get tools to open it.
1,I lost my money,I bought two usb memories: San Disc 4 GB. It's perfect but voyager was bad experience.
4,big and bouncy,"I'd give this thing 5 stars, except for the fact that I can't seem to get the darn thing out of my pocket. It's rubber shell, while very protective and fun to bounce up and down on the desk, makes it very ""sticky"" on the inside of my pocket. I like to keep my usb drive in my fifth pocket on my jeans, you know, the small pocket that's just above the regular pocket? Anyway... The rubbery texture makes it hard to get out. Other than that, this is a great unit. The upload speed is definitely noticably slower that the download speed. But once you get all your stuff on there, it comes off pretty quickly."
3,corsair flash voyager for win 98,you should not buy this item if you have Win 98 as it requires a special driver. The product ad did not warn the buyer of this requirement. With some difficulty the special driver can be downloaded on the web where it it is obvious this requirement is needed.
2,It was good while it lasted,"I purchased an 8 GB Corsair drive in 2007. It has the thick rubber coating. It worked quite well for over a year. I did not do a lot of heavy use, but maybe three times a month I used it. Speed was adequate it seemed. Some USB slots it would not fit into because the rubber is too thick. I carried it in my pocket all the time.After about 14 months it suddenly stopped working. Dead. The computer tells me to reformat it, but I have chosen not to destroy the data in case some day I figure out how to get it off.I will purchase another brand to replace it."
4,A very nice Flash ...Almost,The Corsair 64GB Flash Voyager is a fine flash dcrive. That IS the bottom line. The nagging problem I have had (and continues) is that Microsoft Money keeps telling me the drive is full when I backup. I have not been able to determine if this is a Microsoft issue or a product issue. The backup file is actually written but I keep getting this nagging message to backup my files. Hmm... I have no answer!
4,FlashVoyager,"Flash Voyager 8 gb is great with only one drawback.Pro - Rubberized cover should give it a lot of protection, looks neat, works great. Wonderful to put 8gs in this small a space.Con - only one - the USB tip protector is not quite tight enough and tends to fall off."
5,Great drive,I just recently bought this drive and I love it. I work in the IT department of a 200+ company and I use this thing regularly to transfer outlook personal folders that that are in the 4-6 gb range. The drive is quick and reliable.
3,Rubber Outer Coating? Why,"Flash Drives Is Mostly The Same as All The Other Brands, The Only Problem That I Have Is ThatRubber Coating That Is On These Drives, Picks Any Dust, Like A Dust Magnet, Looks Filthy."
4,"Excellent thumbdrive, but also a dust magnet","The drive itself is great... good speed, and it is rugged as they advertise. My only problem, right now (and it's just a tiny detail), is how easily dust gets stuck to that rubber cover."
4,Speed and space at low cost,"Corsair!! just the name brings quality to our minds!! in that new usb 3.0 era the old but still useful 2.0 usb have new and reasonable pricesthat can help a lot at the time to decide a buy.That usb 16 Gb data traveller is fast, reliable and very very useful as container or turbo boost for windows 7.Get it if you can... that Corsair quality means that you will have a durable usb drive that can be with you long time."
5,"Great flash drive. Fast, durable, lots of capacity.","This flash drive is faster than average, and very well made. At 16 GB it's plenty big enough for my needs. It has a blue activity light, a snug-fitting rubber cap and rubber outer coating and a key ring loop. I haven't tested it for moisture resistance but it looks tight and is built like a tank. It's a bit bigger than average (about 2.75"" in length) but for me that's a plus - I lose these things like crazy. The best flash drive I've owned. Highly recommended."
5,Works,"Plug it in and it works as it should. No annoying software on it. Well housed. Only complaint I have with it is that the end cap isn't part of the housing and can therefore get lost. Otherwise, great!"
4,Pretty dang good.,"I'll just start right away with some cons: it didn't come with any keychain of any sort for me, I had to attach my own through the loop. And there is slight risk of loosing the cap, which comes off completely, but it isn't loose at all when on, just easy to misplace.With cons out the way, it's GREAT for the price! Sturdy and durable, compact and clean, huge space, works like a charm... I personally don't like that weird program that's installed with the SanDisk flash drives, it bugs the heck out of me when it automatically installs in people's computers, and it's just there... But with this, it's just raw space, a nice 8 gigs, all just for me =D.A definite buy... I just had to throw the cons in, just to be an absolute critic!"
4,Corsair 16Gb Flash Rocks,I had been waiting to purchase a 16Gb drive until the prices dropped a bit. Now the price was reasonable and the 16Gb allowed me to consolidate three smaller 4 Gb drives. Speed is not the fastest but definitely sufficient for most apps. I run Portable apps suite on this and have it as a DOS bootable disk for use with Ghost images. Boot time is only slightly slower than a conventional DOS boot. I like the rubber coating as it makes it easy to grasp firmly. I am now able to keep all of my support utilities in one place. Now - when will prices on the 32 Gb drop so I can upgrade again.
4,It simply works,The 4GB USB 2.0 Flash Voyager worked absoluteley flawlessley right our of the box. The rubber casing gives a nice tactile sensation. The only potential negative is the rubber loop which makes it hard to put the drive on to my keychain.
5,"Great Capacity, fast enough","I'm a big fan of this product. With the 16 gb capacity, I'm able to put almost anything I need on it. It's much faster than burning a CD, and much more changeable. I wonder if I'll ever have to defrag it!I have used it for transferring music files, photos, and text files to another computer as well as backing up data. I've dropped it a few time, with no signs that I did, physically or data-wise.I thought it was a great deal for the capacity. I'm sure the price will go down significantly soon, but I needed this size NOW."
2,Broke!,"Rubber skin ensures that if any pressure is placed on the stick while plugged in, it will bend and break. Only last me two weeks"
5,My first flash drive but I love it!!!!,"I have had this for at least a month or so. I did look online at what other people said about flash drives and thought I'd give this one a try beings this is my first. I think it's awesome!!! I'm not really a tech geek but I love stuff like this. I think it's pretty fast to put things on there. It's easier than I thought. Plug and play as they say. Anyway I have bought a new computer as my other one crashed and I lost all of my pic's,music everything. I was not a happy camper. I'm not taking anymore chances at that happening so I looked into buying a flash drive. I've also put my stuff on a few dvds also. I have no regrets at buying this and would highly suggest it to anyone looking for a flash drive. I'm eventually going to get an external drive as well. I'm not going to loose my stuff like I did before as I'm sure there are alot of people that have as well... Very Pleased with it... Thanks Amazon for selling it.."
4,Corsair reformatted for XP,"The Corsair Voyager is a good, solid product. However, I discovered that, to have it work well with my older version of XP, I had to reformat it from FAT32 to NTFS. After that it works fine, although a tad slow. Of course it may be my 1GB RAM on the box that is contributing to the slowness."
5,Definitely a good addition to the Mint Cleaner,I definitely recommend the second room navigation cube - as this has allowed the Mint to go from one room to the other to clean a large space. This is much easier than taking the single cube from room to room.
1,Doesn't work for me,"I thought this extra cube would allow me to send my dearly beloved Mint into two separate rooms. That, apparently, is not the case unless at some point Mint can see both of the cubes. I live in a mid-century house with small bedrooms off a central hallway. There's no way I can get the cubes to communicate. The second cube was a waste of money, but I still LOVE the Mint. Best thing that ever happened to wood and tile floors."
2,Interesting topic but doesn't add value,"The article McDonald wrote was well written in Fortune magazine but unfortunately is not much more informative in the 100+ page book that follows. McDonald attempts to connect phenomena (games, economics, business, & war) to concepts in which he feels cross between disciplines. However, the writing style of his book swtiches back and forth between making assertions and stating examples that are so broad that at some point becomes unrelated to the whole point of the book. One example even tries to describe the chemistry of ideal gases and how it's related to pure competition! I was expecting that the book would dive into deeper aspects of how poker was related to investing as he described in the article but mainly talks about concepts already written in standard college textbooks. I suspect that McDonald tried to rush his writing of the book and grabbed straws to fill out the pages. My recommendation is to read the article and not the book!"
3,"Strategy, good, but kind of unsatisfying","Okay, over all I like this book. I don't know exactly what I thought this book would provide. I think I was looking for a little more game theory than what this provided me. It is short, and pretty good, so I would have to say it is worth your time."
5,the Ultimate peaceful relaxing music,"Miracles is the first CD I listed to by Rob Whitesides-Woo, and it immediately sent me on a chase to find my own copy. His music is so truly peaceful and relaxing, yet stirring, I feel very uplifted whenever I listen to it. It is perfect for meditation or other inward-focused moments. Thank you, Mr. Whitesides-Woo, for your beautiful inspirational works!"
4,How The Other Half Lives,"The main character is a rich widow who in the first episode throws her hat up in the air in joy upon leaving her husband's funeral service. Unfortunately, she finds her husband left her with less money than expected, and horrors! A businessman of Polish decent moves into her old mansion, and she decides that the man is not her kind of people. Much of the humor comes out of the main character being out of touch with how other people live and her own snobbishness."
2,Not for the beginner,"Contains a lot of pictures and text about Chet. Does not contain a lot of Chet""s more popular instrumentals. There are no chord diagrams or chord notations in the tabs. There are no performance notes or tab explanations for the more difficult sections in the tabs. Might be good for the more advanced players skilled at reading music."
4,Outremer,I purchased this book after finding it at the Donovan Library at Infantry Hall. This is a great book for its age on the basics of Crusader construction and influence in the region.Worth the purchase to complete a good Crusades library.
2,FUN FOR 10 MINUTES,"This toy broke about and hour after I got it. The teefh broke on the handle. It would probably work longer if you were careful, but in a nerf war it's hard to take your time."
3,Not that easy to use for kids under 6,"I bought this for my son, he is almost 6. The coordination between pulling the air into the gun at the back and shoot the balls is not so easy. However, easy to shoot and receiving the shooting balls are not painful between the kids.Although not easy to use, they are still having fun with it."
3,Not very powerful,"I bought the Hasbro Nerf Buzzsaw Blaster for my 2 sons for Christmas. The price was $5.00 each. The reviews said it was a very loud toy. I couldn't pass up the price, so I bought some anyways. This is a VERY LOUD toy! You have to manually pull the wheel into action, then when the trigger is pressed, a ball drops down and the wheel spits it out.If you get the wheel going as fast as it will go, the balls go pretty fast and hit rather hard. For an older kid or an adult this would be a fun toy. For kids (mine are 7 and 5) this toy is big and they don't have the patients to rev the wheel up as much as is needed, so it just gets tossed out.Like I said, this is now considered an ""outside"" toy in our house because it is so loud. And I'm guessing it won't be used much until the Uncles come down and start a war in our back yard. It's definitely a summer gift idea."
3,this is so loud!,"We bought this for my son, he likes it, but it is so loud and awkward just to shoot...i wasnt very impressed."
2,"Okay, but noisey and malfunction proned","The toy is very loud and since I bought it for my dog, I noticed that you can't re-shoot the balls after they get wet (my dogs slobber), they get stuck so you have to dry them off afterwards. Other than those two things, what nerf toy is a great toy."
2,Dud,"I just bought this toy. I have 6 yr old and 8 yr old boys. This toy is loud, but not as loud as some of the reviews would leave you to believe. Still, better as an outside toy. The toy fires by putting (no more than) three balls in the chute and cranking up the drive wheel. When you get the wheel up to a decent RPM you can pull the trigger and the ball shoots out (in a semi-automatic way you can rapid fire up all three balls). The problem is that the wheel looses RPM very quickly and by the time you get to the second (and third) ball it barely goes 10 feet. If the RPM drops too low the ball will become jammed in the barrel, causing a problem that only an adult will be able to fix with the help of something long enough to poke down the barrel to pop the ball out.Overall ""fun value"" is low due to the noise and the quick loss of RPM. My boys got bored with it quickly. Regular neff dart guns are much much better."
2,Poor design leads to less fun!,"The gun can only hold 3 nerf balls at once which leaves you on the loosing side of combat when you're having to reload all the time.It does hold up to it's name. It's about as loud as a buzzsaw. Sometimes too loud.I've had better luck with the smaller, less expensive dart style guns."
1,EPIC FAIL BLASTER,"this is probably the worst nerf blaster ever created, it is obnoxiously loud, it has a tiny range and it is expensive for how terrible it is, if you have an extra 22 dollars on hand buy a better gun like the big bad bow or the dual mavericks but AVOID THIS ONE."
4,Very well-done,"...In the second installment of the Fire-us, we pick up where The Kindling left off. The Family, consisting of Mommy, Hunter, Teacher, Action Figure, Teddy Bear, Baby, and Doll, with newcomers Angerman, Puppy, and Kitty, have been welcomed into a secret society of religious adults who had survived the deadly Fire-Us. They soon discover (some later than others)that this new-found paradise may be darker than it looks, and they are not as safe as they think they are.This book was my least-favorite in the Trilogy, not through any fault of its own, but because I love the other two more. Though I have difficulty sympathizing with the new heroine introduced in The Keepers (Cory, a girl with a strange past), I feel the character development was wonderful; we see how our heros are, essentially, growing up, as afraid as they are of it.Beautiful writing and gripping plot: 4 stars."
2,My fishes are not liking this,Not up to the expectations. My fishes are not liking this. Too costly for the quantity....I will not recommend this.
4,Great Deal!,It's a great deal for a 4 month supply. This is my first time using this product. They say it takes up to 4 months to see anything. Well I'm on my 4th bottle and haven't notice any changes. I'll continue using this to give it a chance to see what comes from it.
3,delivery ok - good condion,"I receive it very fast and in good condition after ordering;no issue about that.Today is the sole product that have scentific result on hair loss on a few percetage of the people, so I use it instead of nothing but i don't see significant results; I do hope that a more effective solution will come up soon."
3,"Stop, and Listen..","I have been using Rogaine in different forms for over 12 years. (I am almost 40 with a balding crown) The foam worked for me but no where close to as good as the liquid. The foam slowed hair loss BUT it stilled occured.My doctor told me that I only had to apply the liquid once a day (stuides showed)and for the last 4 years I have gone back to the liquid. I use immediately after a morning shower and then dressed, then styled my hair as usual. The liquid stopped hair loss and recovered some of what I lost from the foam. (I used the foam twice a day).For the last 2 years I have been using the generic version of it and it works the same, no difference, at a much lesser price. My only regret is switching to the foam 6 or so years ago and trying to get that hair back that the liquid seemed to fight off."
3,Good but pricy,"The product is good although bit pricy but good. Found it to be better than the alternatives but still pricy, recommended. Would be a hit if had a more competitive price."
3,"It might be great, it might be useless i shall never know !","Well i must say it seems from the reviews this product may have helped me, alas 6 MONTHS on and numerous unreturned emails later i remain rogaineless.I have ticked ""its ok"" as it is not poor rogains's fault but it's mercyless and pityless slave master ""monsterhotdeals"" it keeps him shackled and far from my reach, the line of kings is bro...err i mean my hairline is broken.Well it's back to spittle and the dance of my people to try and help me it seems...Mary ?, get a fresh monkey and my perfectly legal ornamental and aesthetic value only sacrificial death blade.Merry christmas ""monsterhotdeals"" maybe you could send me a hat for winter instead, even a pink one you found on the wall outside a school would do.Regards,The man with no nam... rogaine."
3,Okay so far,I have to admit that I haven't used it enough to get ideal results. I am still needing to finish what I have and be more consistent with it.
3,it helps,"After 8 months of using roaine, my hair is still falling, however, looks fuller, thicker. I was expecting more about this product."
5,Excellent choice!,This book tells of the Seven Sacred rites of the Oglala Sioux. It is excellent preparation for anyone who plans to visit the Sioux area. It is also an excellent educational book for teens providing another cultural perspective on many secular and religious rites of today. Easy to read. The paperback version is very portable and can be used as a ready reference while traveling.
4,Black Elk was a good person to get to become a Shaman.,The book was about a young boy who was having vision at an early age. Not only that he was very ill when he had his first vision. At the end he became a Shaman which is closed enoughed as being a preist.
4,Refreshingly different take on canned sardines,"The Season product line of canned sardines I think is one of the best, but even so it took a bit of courage to order these sardines in a ""sweet and tangy sauce"". What will they be like? Will they be super hot? Will they be sardines packed in salsa? What will I get.Well, I was pleasantly surprised at the understated taste of the sauce. You can still taste plenty of sardine, but the sauce offsets the fishyness substantially. In fact, as far as I can tell the sauce is clear with the exception that it leaves the fish itself a shade or two darker than canned sardines would usually be.At first I thought it tasted rather strange but sort of good, but the taste grew on me and by the time I finished the can I wanted more. So, if you're getting bored with your usual canned sardines, these may be your ticket to some variety."
3,Good for an occasional change of pace,"The subtle, light broth in which these sardines are packed is neither sweet nor tangy to me. There is some sugar and a little salt in the flavor, but it is really underwhelming. The fish is quite good, but I'm not happy about all of the fat including the saturated fat."
5,A pleasant change from the usual,"I was surprised by these-they've got a lively flavor, & they're also fairly low in sodium, so they're pretty good if you're trying to lower your salt intake."
5,An excellent book for little ones,"I have a two and a half year old daughter who reads this book along with me (with all the appropriate roars, honks, hisses etc) at least twice every night since I've bought the book. The storyline is simple with bright illustration and very engaging. It would appeal to any little one as they are usually fascinated with animals and love to mimic all the different sounds. I highly recommend this book to parents of young children."
5,kids viwe on the game stoks,"yea the game is relly cool gouing places, you meet pepole with out to wait for them to runby your house like the ariginole sims. I havent beten this game but i would never ever lerend about this if my freind would have never rent it. i thought they didint cut out the bad stuff but wants you get to know the game it's prety fun. the way it saves takes to much space its a good thing that i had a membery card at 1010 this game is fun but you shuld by axtru membery or you will buy the gme for nothing and you want get that for."
3,It can be better,This games pretty good but it requires the highest powerd GCN Memory Card Out. Thats the worst downside. Its pretty good but gets boring after progressing through for a couple hours of the game. This game is good for those rare people that like to play videogames for a short period of time and play again a little later in the day. I don't reccomend this game to NEW sims players because this can be pretty confusing of a game and the little booklet given with the game sucks it is printed in Black & White. NOW THATS CHEAP!
4,better than more!,"I know this game has not come out yet, but i think it's going to be great. I think this game will be even be better than Sims 2. You may be surprised that I want it so much, and I only gave it 4 stars, but that is only because it is not released yet."
3,NOt that different,I got the game about a weeka ago thinking it was good and original because of the reviews i read. i started it out and it was really cool because of the graphics. I became bored and played it less and less. The concept is the same as the pc version and The bustin out part isnt all that. You are limited to certain places and can't do that much fun stuff. Interaction is basically the same and if you already have the sims for pc don't buy this. The game is not much different and it costs a lot of money.
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!,"What a bad game! It stinks! The create a sims is half way decent...but it still stinks. Controls stink, furniture stinks, graphics are decent.IF YOU WANT FUN BUY SIMS 2 FOR THE PC!!!"
2,I don`t do tittles,"Basically another boring sim game.you create a sim,make it do stuff,do boring goals,get a job...*yawn*Reeeaaaaaaaaaallllllllll boring stuff there.If your a sim fan I recomend you don`t get this one,it`s THE SAME THING AS ALL THE OTHER ONES!I don`t know how you like that crap!Oh well,buy it if you want,it`s a waste of $$$$ to me."
2,"Love it, but it's not 100% silver","So, this ring is really beautiful and I absolutely love it, except it is NOT 100% silver. I am allergic to nickel and therefore have to get silver or gold jewelry. I bought this ring because it was ""silver"" but low and behold, I got a really bad rash from it which would NOT happen if it were 100% silver. If you are not allergic to nickel, then go for it, its a great ring. If you are, don't plan on making this an everyday wear ring."
3,"Pretty design, weak metal",This ring looks great but is not the best quality. Metal loses it's shape after wearing and is easily damaged.
4,Nice ring,"The only reason this is getting 4 instead of 5 stars is because the coloring of the stone is a little yellow, but clear and lovely all the same. The setting is nice and there are no snags. I've already been complimented on this ring a few times."
5,Sister Gifts 4,"This is my birthstone. I've always wanted a birthstone ring, but I've never found one simple and attractive enough to suit me. Now I have. I liked it so much, I gave one to each of my sisters with their own birthstones."
3,"Okay, wouldn't buy this again","This ring turned my finger green, and when it comes to jewelry, that's not exactly what i prefer. Cute, but seems to be very cheaply made. Sorry..."
5,This product is very good,This product works wonderful and I will be buying another one real soon for my other fish tank. I will recommend anyone with a fish tank to get one.
3,Okay,"Great detail on the design, looks just like the picture but when the ring is in, you cannot see the design on the bottom ball because it is angled down. Instead, you see the design on the top ball and red ovals on the bottom."
4,Fabulous fact-based recounting of the Salem Witch Trials.,"This book is a collection of trial transcripts, maps, and other documents and information regarding the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. The most famous of witch trials, the hysteria is recaptured here for you to sort through yourself. This book is NOT a ""story"", but a valuable tool for doing your own research on the matter. Fabulous reading, wonderous facts, mysterious information, and education abound. Buy this book today!"
5,Best Version of 'Let It Snow' ever!,"This definately is an item that will be in my collection. I looked in all of my local music stores and couldn't find it. Guess everyone's selling out of it! Well, I can certainly see why! I had a store order it for me. 'Cause guys, you did a GREAT JOB! I love you, I love what you've done for this already classic song, and I hope you come to Tulsa soon! Hope you read this!"
5,"ghpeters@att.net looking for cd single let it snow ,ricochet","i am looking for a cd single,let it snow,by the band:ricochet.if you have a copy in like new condition,i would like to purchase it from you.my e-mail address is:ghpeters@att.net"
5,MAX DESERVES FIVE STARS - SUPERB PERFORMANCE,"Complex, calming, wonderful mystical melodies to drift off with, make slow love to, meditate in."
4,OLD TO THE NEW!,"I collect CD singles of songs that I have on vinyl to put onto my itunes library because the quality is better. I bought this single because of the B-side song ""Marmalade"" (That's not available on the album). So far,so good."
1,A Wanna Be Hero,"Zlotnick comes accross as some kind of Superman, Truely a wanna be hero. The whole Viet nam War revolves around him and his superhuman exploits.... Even has Generals asking his Lt. grade advice.He can't talk the talk and he definitely didn't walk the walk..Don't Buy It... Try Dr. Zuess, you'll get more out of it."
4,"Wynn Stewart, Bakersfield Pioneer","These are the famous Playboy Sessions, After The Storm, for the Bakersfield icon Wynn Stewart, probably his best, along with the Capitol Recordings. Wynn stewart a big influence on the Bakersfield sound, and the troubadour Merle Haggard, Haggard starting his career playing bass in Stewart's band, recording Stewart's ""Sing A Sad Song"" included on this cd, also notable songs on here, ""Season's Of My Heart"", a George Jones original, plus the Stewart standards, ""It's Such A Pretty World Today"", ""Big,Big,Love"" and one song that really caught my ear,""Lonely Rain"". One song that doesn't fit on here is the novelty, ""Don't Monkey With My Widder"", but most of all it's that unique voice of Wynn Stewart that rolls up and down smoothly and precisely note for note, and like Paycheck with the right management and direction Wynn Stewart could have stood above the rest. This Audium cd is of good quality and sounds excellent."
4,Breaking up is hard to do,"Break up albums have that distinct charm of not caring that allows one to relax and bare their soul. It also finds bands gripping at something they once had but not quite reaching it. Like the Smiths ""Strangeways Here We Come"", another good breakup album, there are good tracks and forgettable material alike.Their political side is highlighted in the mysterious ""Jack Ruby"". ""Laundromat"" rocks and contains one of their best lines : ""Just give me some tension release."" Their are some nice moments on side two. The uplifting spring heralding ""June"", and the lovelorn ""All Her Favorite Fruit"". I do enjoy this album, but there is an inconsistency to it that just makes me want for more."
4,another college-era favorite,"Cracker may've sucked by Camper were great. ""Jack Ruby"" is especially great. And ""I was Born in a Laundromat"" is a searing, angry (got that sounded bad-- I sound like a mediocre rock critic) story of a white-trash upbringing that just seethes. You can't go wrong for a couple of bucks. It's a keeper."
4,just give me some tension release,"It's very easy to call this album ""boring"" in comparison to the rest of the band's catalog, but it's not to be written off. Gone is the experimental stuff, and for the most part so is the goofy sense of humor and eclecticism, but what's left is some well-written clever pop. Imagine a Cracker album but with some mideastern violins once in a while, and you've got the picture. It's a bit heavy on the slow songs, so when there's the rare one that's a little less than excellent things can start to drag, but most of them are beautiful, and songs like ""I Was Born In A Laundromat"" and their cover of Status Quo's ""Pictures Of Matchstick Men"" manage to punch things up at just the right places. While I'd reccomend Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart over this for a first purchase (it's as accessible, but done with a lot more creativity), it's still a very solid album."
2,You got to be kidding,"I don't know who wrote all these raving reviews, but after buying into their hype and buying the CD and listening to it, I'm wondering who paid these guys off. Not bad songs technically, just something you'll never play more than once. No glimpses of genius; no euphoria; no whispers of one's primordial soul to rememberence; no passion. Better to donate to the Red Cross than to waste your $ on this one..."
5,there's something of the desert here,"It's funny how lyrics which seem objectively silly can deeply stir you when sung in some mysterious context. This album manages such a feat. And then there are lyrics which are poetry no matter which way you cut them. For someone who likes pretty songs you have to first get used to the discordant violin in this album...like scotch, you might not like the first few sips but once you alow it to work its magic on you there's no going back. You will have been rewarded for allowing yourself to discover the dark beauty beneath the surface dicord. It will sound like a wolf howling at the desert moon, the distant sound of a gypsie caravan with dancing bears dancing the cancan...it's one of those wonderful experiences which can enrich your life."
5,Less Obvious Desert Island Classic,"Some bands rise to the occasion once and make a really timeless record and while it may be argued by some that CVB has done it more than one, nothing they released was anywhere indicative of what they could achieve. This is a classic example of what a great producer can do with the right band and the right songs at the right time. I love the production on this album. It's very cohesive - sit through the album from start to finish to get the full effect."
1,Lincoln 12 volt charger,"This thing is junk,I have tried two of them now and both died within 2 days."
4,Lincoln Power Luber 12V Charger,A must have option for the Lincoln Power Luber for use with the 12V gun. Allows charging of the battery while in the field by plugging into any 12v vehicle power port. Been using this for about a month now and seems to working fine. Fully charges a battery in about 45 minutes.
1,Yet Another Profit making propaganda tool,"Yet another ""Christian"" author is here to reinforce stereotypes to a willing flock and make a quick buck in the process."
5,A thinking man's military thriller.,"This book has a few shortcomings; it's a little light on flesh, and some of the plot structures are little simplified. However, what this book does deliver in spades is the pilot's eye view of war, not from the cockpit, but from his own throughts. We get a glimpse into the mind of junior officers, the fears of naval flying (many, I know from my own experience), the management styles that work and those that don't. All this is tied into an exciting story that requires just a little more input from the reader than most books. That input is well rewarded."
5,"Unlike Clancy, Not Everything Works","Punk's War doesn't have much to do with Iraq or Iran. Its bombs don't fall from planes as much as they float out of Ink Jet printers as fitness reports. Punk's war is against a strained supply chain, surly master chiefs, the human need to sleep and jets that are older than the pilot. It's a tale of the modern navy where one guy tries to do his job despite the best efforts of the chain of command to thwart him.Read this book."
2,"Aviator's Lame Attempt at a Modern Day ""Mr Roberts""","I tried to go into this book with an open mind, but it's just so...Aviator...oh, woe is the aviator, the surface guys just don't understand us, we just fly because we love to fly; all the typical stereotypes. I definitely agree with the Tom Clancy comparison, because it contains a lot of the self-serving whining that Clancy has regressed to in Executive Orders, Rainbow Six, and Bear and Dragon.I do give Mr Carroll credit for the broader picture of ennui and frustration he paints, and the scenes actually in the cockpit are very good. He is not a bad writer, but if you want the original version of this story, read Thomas Heggen's ""Mr. Roberts."""
2,Doesn't hold up to Dishwashing,"After using Yamazaki Ariana Gold Accent flatware for more than 2 years I can not recommend it. The flatware eventually became tarnished looking, the gold is spotty and the handles look dirty and tarnished. If you are going to only handwash your cutlery then perhaps this item will work for you."
5,"Durable, Roomy and Stylish","I was looking for a laptop bag that would fit my lunch, a water bottle, 15"" MacBook Pro and misc. papers, folders, etc. that was not black or bulky. This fits the bill, and after several months of use still looks brand new! Reminds me of a Timbuk2 bag, but this bag is less expensive."
4,"Pocket-full, light weight, durable","I'm a fan of lowepro brand having cameras and video.. so I bought this bag originally based on the reviews, brand satisfaction and cost. I have been satisfied with the bag and no regrets for the cost. I have 17"" mac. The pockets are great. My only disappointment, which is minor, is the bag doesn't stand on it's own well and leans towards the front. But that's very minor - great pockets, material, very roomy, affordable, stylish, and you have lowepro quality! My coworker wants one."
1,Save your money,"Still in middle school? Okay, then MAYBE this would be a good purchase... but only if you're taking remedial classes...Otherwise, please listen to me and save your money. These are bad. They are not bad in a good way, either. They are so amateurishly done that the producers seem to have had no interest at all in what the final product would look like.There are some GREAT low-budget horror flicks out there like ZOMBIE HONEYMOON, SHATTER DEAD, FEEDING THE MASSES, BLACK SHEEP, FIDO, and STINK OF FLESH. The problem with these films is NOT the low budget; it's the low expectations."
5,The BEST pads,"Everybody makes yellow legal pads but these have the super-sturdy cardboard back and the right lines. Yes, they're more expensive but not by much and the paper feels great. Totally worth it."
5,Finally found,"I had something like this in California before I moved to Arizona. My sister found the rack online, and I am very pleased with it. It is stronger than I had before and I love how it goes out of the way when I am not using it."
4,Heads-Up on installation problem,"LOVE the product but my husband was not crazy about the installation parts. Had problems getting the item to stay secure to the wall, so he had to go out and buy other hardware. Bought one for myself and one as a housegift (which I hesitate to give). Probably will end up keeping it myself."
3,2nd one but read why,This is the 2nd one. The 1st one broke but it's the only rack to fit the wall space. It is just too flimsy.
4,awesome,needed to replace the one that was broken (our fault). It arrived on time. It simply just works for us.
1,Poorly designed - falls apart,"I mounted the brackets on the wall and slid the rack into them. Immediately, the crossbars popped out! The problem is that they are not attached to the telescoping arms, they are just held in place by pressure (the bars ends fit into receiver sockets in the arms.)Carefully checking, I discovered that, indeed, I had mounted the brackets about 1/16 inch farther apart than intended, so I blamed myself and put four more holes in my wall, a bit closer together this time.Installed the brackets and mounted the rack. Felt pretty good about it. Then I pulled the arms out to the full telescoping length and the darn crossbars fell out again! The problem is that the arms, when fully telescoped, are fairly flexible, so just a little bit of pressure in the wrong direction can move them apart - and it takes less than 1/4 inch of movement to cause the bars to release.In short, even properly installed, this device is too poorly designed to actually work."
1,Fell apart immediately,"This rack is very flimsy. The rods pop out constantly. I tried gluing them back in but they just do not hold. And I tried only hanging a few items at a time, usually my 6 year old's clothes, and could not get this rack to stay together. I do not recommend this at all. Complete waste of my money."
3,Very convenient but don't overload it,"I mounted this in my laundry room and my wife uses it constantly. We have lots of items that can't be dried so we used to have things laying all over the dryer and even on the couch in the living room. Now she just hangs it on this rack. It isn't sturdy enough for really heavy items, she's already broken one of the bars off by over loading it. I'd recommend this item."
4,Not a bad head unit,"This unit comes with a hide away unit. Finding a location for it took some thinking (as it is not very small). Also, it does take a little while to come on and actually play when you power it up. I guess the signal cables from the hide away unit and the actual head unit etc etc. So far it is a really great head unit to buy."
1,very expensive and not that good,"very expensive and not that good, bad software, slow, small buttons,it dose what it says but in the worst why it can"
4,"Stay with it, it grows","Personally, it starts with the first two songs. Album comes out, i hear Jay going on about a slow hearse, and then a full horns section on the next tune and start thinking.....OK these guys are going for something completely different and i am not cool with that. Backburner for the next few months. Then I put it on a playlist with other songs from Uncle Tupelo, Nancy Griffith, Neko Case, Calexico, etc. And here it comes, songs like Cicadian Rhythm, Methamphetamine, Adrenaline and Heresy, and Beacon Soul are as good as any that Jay has put out in his career. Its a much cleaner album than other efforts, very well produced and because of that i think Jay's voice sounds a little different than other albums. the bottom line is these guys are putting out music that the mainstream will always ignore, but nonetheless is some of the best stuff i have heard in years."
1,Sorry All,"I know I'll take heat for this, but this albumn is not the Son Volt that many of us fans fell in love with. I don't want to get into a whole thing about how music has to evolve and constantly change and how Farrar can't just stick to his old sound. My point is that I loved those first three albumns, and that this one doesn't belong in the same class with them. If you loved Okemah or Stone, Steel and Bright Lights, than by all means, buy this albumn. It's good. There's nothing wrong with it. It's simply not classic Son Volt, and people should know this before buying it. Many of the reviews that I read made it sound like this was returning to the purity of the older sound, and I don't see that at all. To me, the haunting, somber tone of the early albumns has been replaced by an odd, upbeat, celebratory sound that I don't care for. I think I'll stick to the old ones and leave the rest of Farrar's releases on the shelf."
2,He needs a singer,"Remember the Farrar that belted out ""On liquor I spend my last dime!!"".. Well, that person is long gone and replaced by a whiney, nasal-sounding drone with little range and very little creativity. Okemah was a pretty darn good album and certainly better than most of his 'solo' material but this latest is dull and pointless with weak melodies and even worse lyrical content."
3,"Good for beginning, bad for reference","I picked up this book in order to have a basic reference of OSX's terminal. I wasn't disappointed with the introduction and its reasoning as to ""why you should buy this book and read it""; however, I felt disappointed in it as a reference.After working through it, I did have a greater knowledge of the terminal. However, most terminal commands, whether they be file manipulation or OS/application manipulation - are going to be things that a person refers to on a case-by-case basis. In other words, it's almost impossible to have every single command memorized.Thus, I'd resort to trying to use it as a reference later on... and just found that it's clunky. What would take me a few minutes to find on Google would take me at least ten, if not more, time to find in this book.In short: It's great for an introduction to Unix on OSX, but I'd recommend trying something else if you just want a reference book of commands."
4,bushings not included,"Good product, very sturdy; however, stating ""bushings not included"" is an understatement. It appeared to me, from the picture, that these were manufactured to hold 1/2"" bits by default, therefore I did not need bushings. I was wrong. You need bushings for ALL size bits. One I realized this, I found 20 packs for $4 somewhere else and everything was fine."
3,Expensive total cost with bushings,"Expensive router bit organizer. The bushings are sold separately and make this an expensive set up. If I had realized this, I would have made my own storage board."
5,So happy to find,"I originally bought this pattern in 1974. Over the years a few pieces have been broken. I was amazed and thrilled to find some replacements on Amazon. The company provided great service that actually owned the product ""mytableware.com."""
3,Not very good quality,The protects are a good design. But it is cheaply made. The quality of the tool is very bad. I didn't think it was good for a gift.
3,Great idea but poorly made,This is a great idea and could be a great help but it broke the first time I tried to use it. It was cheaply made and came apart. Guess you get what you pay for but I thought I paid for better than I got this time.
3,"Does its job, doesn't solve the problem","This little gadget is a great idea for short bracelets. However, the bracelet which prompted me to order it has such a tiny clasp that it is anybody's guess as to whether or not I will be able to garner much help in the way of actually getting the thing fastened. I have found my husband to be more helpful!"
4,Braclet Buddy Set--Gift for Mom and Grandma.,"I do like the Bracelet Buddy. It makes bracelets easier to put on when one has fingers that do not cooperate with little things like clasps etc. The enclosed picture and written direction flyer for both hands is handy. It is ""half-toothless"" so the plastic alligator clamp should not scratch. The molded plastic handle is easy to hold with either hand. With a bit of thought and ingenuity, one could invent other ways to put this device to good use. AND it is made in the USA--YEA! It is hard to find USA-made ""stuff"". Oh, it was purchased for me, myself and I--Grin!"
5,quincy gal,The bracelet buddy was just as described. Now I can finally wear those pesky bracelets that I could never hook by myself!
5,A Great little gadget,"I really like this. I was having a lot of difficulty putting on my bracelets and was frustrated enough that I wouldn't even buy them if they had a clasp. Using this, I can fasten any of my bracelets with ease now and I don't have to worry about what type of bracelet it is. I haven't had a problem with any of the bracelets I've tried it on so far."
5,great company!,my original product was stolen from my mailbox. The company was very responsive to my needs. I recommend them highly. The product is also good.
4,not just for Grandma!,not just for grandma anymore! great product for the single gal who doesn't have anyone to hook those bracelets for her!
3,Braclet buddy,I bought these for Christmas presents and have not used them yet. I was disappointed that they were made of plastic and I am concerned it will not last. They look very pretty and are long enough.
2,Just ok,"The gadget does work. I find it bulky, gawky, looks like cheap plastic. I bought two, one as gift. Not worthy of gift giving."
1,Bracelet Buddy/ Love it.,"Bracelet buddyWell pleased/ met all requirements.Gave one as a gift and recepient is pleased also.Will order more items from time to time.Thank You,Barbara Young"
3,Bracelet Buddy,Not as good as one I purchased from TV quite a while ago. The end didn't hold the bracelet as tight as it should.
4,"close to 5 stars, but not quite...","if you are farmiliar with Daedelus' other work, this album may come as a suprise when you first listen to it. It doesnt have the same cohesive nature as Snowdonia or Invention, which in my opinion, keeps it very interesting. The instrumental tracks on here are the standouts, along with Impending Doom, where MF gets nice to a different beat than you will be used to hearing him rhyme over.The only song on this album that gets skipped is cadavre exquis, which the album really could have done without.The remixes on here from Prefuse and Jogger are two of the highlight songs for sure, definitely standout tracks.Overall its probably his best album along with Invention, so pick it up quick"
2,"Easily broken, jerkey movements",Part of the tripod head is detachable and to attach it the part snaps into place with plastic pieces. The plastic hook broke and my camera fell right off the tripod. Also I found the head made very jerky movements while recording.
2,Do not Recommend,"Broke the first time I used it, wind tipped it over, broke the handle off.Bought one with retractable spikes instead."
4,Understanding how the other guy thinks...,"Marketing managers in high tech rarely have direct experience being on quota. They struggle to understand the differences between how they think and how sales thinks.Escaping the Black Hole bridges this gap. Any marketing manager, and especially product managers, ought to read this book. And if you are in sales, it would help you as well.Plus, this book contains several new ideas and concepts, some of which are based on the kind of insights and perspectives that only come from years of experience in the trenches. In order to make these new concepts come alive, the author includes a lot of useful visuals. If that wasn't enough, the book contains a very helpful cardboard tear-out glossary that doubles as a book mark. This is a feature I would like to see in more thought leadership books."
5,Great man just excellent,Spectacular. Lenny captures the spirit of the sixties and makes it new. He captured the essence of freedom and love and put it in an album.
5,Let Love Rule by Lenny Kravitz,"Lenny Kravitz can seemingly do anything~ sing, write, play guitar like no one's business. The LP, Let Love Rule, is fantastic and so is Lenny K.! From rockers to ballads to outright hilariously told tales, this is definitely an lp/cd to have in your collection. Bravo, Lenny! Thank you, Amazon!"
3,Authenticating,"3 1/2Kravitz's retro-rock debut was not refined to the point of completely escaping caricature. He does have an awful tendency to put out self-conscious genre dabblings which seem to do nothing more than vainly speak ""look at my versatility"", but this early into naive ideals and the earnestness shines through, even if setting poor precedent with a clearly more noticeable first side."
4,A retro album songfest that works the era of Neosoul begins,"I like this debut by Lenny Kravitz, this album could have been released in the early 70's instead of 1989. From the Dylan-like ""sitting on top of the world"" he wears his influences very well and at times surpasses them on the Stax -like ""my pericous love"" with its great piano/organ solo. Lenny would get better and find his own sound and usher in the Neosoul age from which Lauryn Hill, D'angleo, and other black artists would emerge less than a decade later."
2,you must be joking,"so far, total invasion is the only track on here that catches my attention.sure the production and playing is good.and yes, this sounds better than most of the rock out there today (and why would you mention rage against the machine when talking about punk?)but it doesn't live up to this band's pastit sounds more like joke imitating the bands who they inspiredthan just being the jokeand i expect much more from an album that took this long to put togetherof course, everything since night time has disappointed me to some degree or another, so...of course, for the diehards, they may never have found something else to fill the void, and probably shouldn't - so they'll have to make do - i'll stick with the stuff that actually rocked me and didn't just rest on its laurelsand in the meantime, might i suggest - counter culture nosebleed by theory of ruin - i think maybe they can hit that nerve that the joke used to..."
2,killing joke new sound heavy metal,Killing Joke is a great band but this cd sounds nothing like the Killing Joke of old this cd sound a little heavy metel sounding but if that is what you want to hear go for it I wish they still had the origional drummer back as David Groul over drums in a bad way he should stick to Foo Fighter cds
1,Crack Smokers!,"The above reviewers must never have heard music before. This is a horrible album. It tries so hard to be serious and confrontational that i couldn't stop laughing. I truely thought this was a comedy album.This is what Andrew WK would sound like if he tried to be serious.They sound like Helmet ,except bad.Don't get suckered in like I did."
5,THE JOKE ARE BACK,"I used to go to Killing Joke gigs in the 80's because it was clear to me that their music existed not for commercial reasons but for artistic or cathartic reasons. The way I saw it was that all the sheep were listening to the commercial stuff and Killing Joke were saying, 'It doesn't have to be mediochre. Have some of this.' When the Joke 'appeared' on TOTP (UK pop prog) with The Empire Song, Jaz was in Iceland. Most cretins at the time would have gone round the world twice to appear on TOTP.Anyway, the album. Only the Joke could have made this album. It's massive foreground music. Immense structures of sound and power. It's anthemic. It's how it should be done. Nice one lads."
5,WOW. Just WOW.,"This is superb, whether you're a KJ fan from back in the day, or a 90's convert, or just stumbling across it today. BUY THIS CD. It's probably one of the top 5 CDs I have purchased in the last year, and I acquire about 30 a year. Very crunchy, very good songs, EXCELLENT percussion. Took me 2 listens to get absolutely hooked, and its on now. You want good social commentary? Get this. You miss the days when guitars crunched and lyrics meant something? GET THIS! And make sure you check them out on tour!"
4,very close to perfection,"This is an extremely powerful return to form for this classic band. I would give it 5 stars but I feel a couple of songs, namely Asteroid and Dark Forces, which are quite good in themselves, don't measure up to the intensity of the rest of the disc. Even so longtime and new Killing Joke fans will love this record. It's quickly become my favorite CD out of my collection. This music has a way of getting into your psyche and won't let you go, just like all the other classic KJ discs.Highlights of the CD are ""Blood on your hands"" and ""Seeing Red"", both of which have that signature sound KJ invented in the early 80s- equal parts melodic metal, slamming tribal drums, a beautiful vocal melody, and hypnotic throbbing bass locked in with the drums.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,Much Harder,"I bought this CD a few days before it came out so I could have it shipped right when it was supposed to come out. Man, this album is so much better than democracy. Total 180 degrees! I highly recommed this CD. The only problem I would have with this CD is that the beat in the songs gets a little repetitive. Other than that, excellent drumwork by Dave Grohl, and excellent vocal skills. Get this one, it's well worth it."
5,For the 66th time...A great album,"Who knew the old dudes could still rock like this? I saw them live about 8 years ago and they sucked so bad it was like a Spinal Tap sequel, but being a dyed-in-the-wool KJ fan, I had to get this album and boy was I suprised! Good show, old chums!"
5,One of the Gang?,"Now don't get me wrong, I'm a total Killing Joke fan. And this new album is one of the best they ever recorded. That would have been enough to make me happy, but during a quick check of the liner notes I spyed a familiar name. One I wouldn't have connected with Killing Joke. Andy Gill not only produced the album, but he contributed to the writing as well. He even manages to get his guitar in the mix (officially he is credited with ""additional guitar feedback""). So While this disc is a Killing Joke Disc on the surface, there are moments that hint at the Gang of Four. Who could have imagined a team up like this?"
5,Amazing to both diehards and newbies,"It is nothing short of a miracle when a member of one of your favorite current bands (Foo) hooks up with one of your most beloved classic bands (KJ). Who would know that such a marriage would turn out to be so glorious?Strangely, the first song, Death and Resurrection Show, is the one flaw in an otherwise close-to-perfect offering. Seeing Red is worthy of being hailed as an anthem, it is so tightly woven. Jaz, in spite of the milage, is just as passionate, political and angry as ever, and his voice is as rich and exciting as it was in the late 70s and thru the 80s. Dave Grohl's talents actually add to the achievement, lending a pounding energy that fits so perfectly you'd think he'd been with KJ from the very beginning.I seldom buy CDs anymore, because most bore/disappoint me, but this one pounds you into submission and leaves you wanting more. Truly the best album I've heard in a long time."
5,One of the best,"One of the best albums, ever. Of all their work, this one seems to be infused with an aggression that is unmatched. Not sure how much Dave Grohl's drumming has to do with that, but he certainly doesn't hurt. Usually when a band tries to rock harder they end up sounding contrived-- not here-- this stuff is raw and real."
5,A Really Good Killing Joke!!,Wow! I am a long time Killing Joke fan but for years I hadn't kept up with them and for all I knew they were broken up. When I discovered they were still around and had a new album I got it not knowing what to expect. I was amazed at this album. Kiling Joke are at the top of their game and this is one of their best albums yet.
3,Not as great as I had expected,"I was so excited for this book for my daughter who LOVES animals. Right now she is taking a marine biology class and they have disected several animals and she loves to see what is inside, so I was excited for this book. But, it is a lot of talk, and not a lot of pictures. I was expecting a ton more, and different coloring pages, but I would say only a third of the book is coloring pictures. The rest is just talk about class, phylum etc."
2,Amazon 'Look Inside' Preview is plain Awful,"The 'Look Inside' feature of this book is lacking in ALL aspects. Not ONE preview is of an actual drawing page. I'm sure this Amazon feature is somewhat automated for all books, but just 20 seconds of review would have found this huge omission. I'm probably going to order the book as the price is reasonable and other reviews are good."
4,Sony Bluetooth Headphones,"Everything about these headphones works as it should with no complaints, Excellent battery life as well as all around great comfort.I however do have 1 complaint, Sony was not really thinking when they made the AC Adapter for this unit as its is not a 110-240v Adapter, the adapter only works in the USA and so on a recent trip to London, I was stuck with no way to charge the headphones......... I had to purchase a universal AC Adapter to recharge.Aside from that small issue, they are great headphones."
2,Frames breaks on ear piece,"We have had two sets of these. The first one broke on the frame at the ""Y"" leading to the ear piece. The head set was so comfortable that we bought another one. But, after 2 months, the 2nd set broke in the same location, making it also unusable. Won't buy another one."
2,"Fine, when they work","I received these as a gift as use them with a mac, pc, and ipod. Moving them between all three has been a surprising pain. The headphones often cannot sync with each device and I have to re-pair them. It takes a few seconds to pair and the time adds up. The headphones also only communicate problems back to the use through a beeping light. It comes across as very primitive and it often difficult to diagnose errors. I also really wish these headphone could connect via a wire if you wanted them too.Overall these are good headphones, a little snug on the head, but the they are tied to a terrible wireless standard (bluetooth) and are not at all easy to use compared to wired headphones. Given their expense, I would definitely recommend getting a different product and would highly recommend against getting anything Bluetooth - it just doesn't work well."
2,"Uncomfortable, lousy sound","I really wanted to like these but ended up returning them. First, they cauliflowered my ears....ouch!! But the real deal killer was the sound...normally I would say, ""Hey, not bad"". But I also have a pair of Plantronics 590Es that I bought 2 years ago. Yikes!! The Plantronics utterly destroy these Sonys...the Sony equalization is a disaster that ruins your music...I think they are doing high frequency filtering like Dolby B noise reduction. Nevermind that the Plantronics are also almost 1/3 the cost. So I ended up ordering another pair of Plantronics. Funny, I have had bad luck with Sony headphones over the years....they want too much for this kind of junk."
2,Uncomfortable,"I bought it to use with my iMac Intel, but found OS X 10.4 does not support A2DP. I was able to install a hack to get it working. But I felt quite a bit of discomfort around my ears after listing on this headset for a couple of hours. I bought this pair along with a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headset. The Sennheiser did not cause me any discomfort. The Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headset's ear muffs are bigger and come more patting than the Sonly DRBT50. I am returning the Sonly DRBT50 headset."
1,No fun,The Sony DRBT50 won't stay linked to the MP3 bluetooth signal generated by my Motorola Adventure V750 phone.They will link at initial set-up (pairing) but the MP3 link is droped after recieving a phone call and the MP3 signal won't link up again unless the phone and the Sony DRBT50 are paired over again.The bluetooth phone link works as advertised.The bluetooth MP3 link does not work as advertised.A waste of money and a big waste of time.
1,Not worth it,"I bought it a year ago or so. It seemed like a good deal but it was not. My set is paired with Mac Pro, I was hoping to use it for Skype and listening to music at work.Problems :1. Bluetuth setup is cryptic and unfriendly, but it works.2. Quality of the sound over skype is bad. Many sound interruptions due to the set(not the Skype). It almost unusable for Skype.3. Quality of sound when listening to music is horrendous, it is unusable for listening music.4. Plugging the charger in automatically turns the phones off. The phones cannot be used while they are being charged.Over all I would say that it is useless when paired with Mac."
5,Wow!,"These headphones are great. Not only can I have them connected to my computer's bluetooth to listen to music and keep game sounds to myself, but I can connect it to my mobile phone too. The quality of the headphones is great (wonderful sound) and the microphone is sufficient for calls in environments without a lot of background noise."
3,ear cup too small; the command button is loose and makes noise when walking,"1. ear cups too small, so that they don't cover my ear fully, and let quite some of noise in the subway to slip in2. the command button is loose, and there for when you walk, the button hits the other parts of the head phone back and forth, and makes ""ka-la ka-la"" sounds.other than above I'm satisfied."
3,Good headphones but bluetooth is a pain,"I really wanted a pair of these cause I keep getting the cord for my earphone caught on handles and it really hurts.My first impression of these was fantastic, really high quality and great sound. However the bluetooth is a pain, I get so much static when I move which is incredibly annoying. Also these things just so crazy if you use them within 20 feet of a microwave that is on. Annoying if you're in an apartment next door to a student who uses the microwave for EVERYTHING!I haven't used them in 3 month because of the bluetooth connection problems. Oh also the microphone sucks, no one can hear me when I'm talking to them."
2,"Decent sound and talking, BAD BAD sound isolation","I bought these to use on my daily commute on the train, specifically picking the ""over-the-ear"" style to try and block outside noises...somehow these little jobbies AMPLIFY all high-pitch noises to unbearable levels. People talking and the train noises are much louder with them on than with them off. I find this true anywhere that there's high frequency noise: malls, buses, crowded sidewalks...pretty much only good at work and at home, not what I needed. There are many good qualities to these headphones, but the few bad make them nearly worthless to me.PROS:Good sound quality over bluetoothEasy setup with my phone/tabletFold-up nice and smallGood volumeGood microphone for phone callsDurableAttractive lookingCONS:Amplifies high-frequency noises to unbearable levelsThe buttons are easily confused when I'm operating them while they're onSmaller than I imagined"
3,Excellent Features but the quality of the device is so so,I absolutely love the features of this head set and it worked awesome for about a month until it slipped off my head when I bent over to pick something up off the ground. The head set fell about 3 feet and now seems to fade in out. I have to tap on it lightly to get the sound to come back. When it is working correctly the sound is great and the freedom it gives me to be untethered to my ipod/iphone is wonderful. All the controls on the side are nice. Kinda wish the play button was a little easier to press. The on off button is a little annoying since you have to hold it for 6 or 7 seconds before it actually turns on. I've accidentally put it into pairing mode a couple of times.Sound Quality I give it a 7~8/10Features I give it a 7/10Durability 3/10Comfort 8/10
4,Excellent Product,"I had never tried a wireless headset before buying this. It works great: fits perfectly on my ears, has long battery life, and I like the controls on it. The only downside is the price; I paid $120.62. Kind of pricey but I think it was worth it. If you are looking for a good set of stereo headphones and you don't mind spending the money, then this set is definitely worth the money."
4,"Great for music and listening, poor microphone","I tried this headphone in an office environment where we can make phone calls from our PCs.When listening to streaming music and news these headphones were great. The sound quality had just the right mix of base and treble. The A2DP profile had no crackle and overall was flawless.My only problem with these headphones was in using the microphone. Since it isn't on a boom it is omni-directional. Often this lead to callers hearing my colleagues more than me, and issue with our phone software modifying volume levels automatically because it thought I was speaking. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this headphone if you need to use the mic anywhere that might be in the slightest bit noisy. That said, the mic did pic up everything it could."
4,DRBT50 on a Mac,"these are no doubt, the most awesome headphones if you have to wear them for extended periods of time, and enjoy quality sound. my only problem has nothing to do with the headphones themselves, but my mac. i was able to pair them very easily, but the sound was terribly mono. after some research i found that mac doesn't support stereo bluetooth connections.... WHAT? it's called A2DP. that's what gives you the 2-channel stereo sound. so to get these to sound right on a mac, you gotta download third-party software.i'm not going to suggest any certain supplier on this forum, but a simple web search will find what you are looking for. my software only cost $20. but figure that into the cost when buying for mac."
3,"nice headphones, pity about the bluetooth","Excellent sound quality, and very comfortable. Unfortunately, pairing (with macintosh and audio/bluetooth bridge) and range were both very spotty. Worse, as some other reviewers have pointed out, there's a slight delay (about 1/20th second) in bluetooth stereo audio transmissions; for music, it's fine, but watching TV/video it's just enough to drive the sensitive crazy as the sound is just a hair behind the video."
2,"Phones are OK, mic is horrible","Bottom Line:Phones are OK (not great, but OK)Mic is horrible (people constantly telling me they can't understand me)***I got this for the long phone calls on cell phone with my girlfriend. I hate the numb ear you get when talking on the phone a long time, and standard one ear bluetooth pieces just hurt my ears.I shelled out good money (these are one of most expensive headsets out there) for quality. I thought it would be nice to listen to music on computer while roaming around house either.When on phone with girlfriend for long periods, I am constantly hearing her ask me to repeat myself. I've only been using them 3 days, and within those 3 long phone calls each time she was constantly saying she either couldn't hear me or couldn't understand me.My quality (the sound from headphones) is OK. It's definitely not distorted and volume is fine, but it does sound a little crackly or ""interrupted"" once in a while."
5,Buenos audifonos,Hace mucho tiempo que queria unos audifonos como estos y fueron facil de ordenar y el envio y manejo estubo a tiempo gracias.
2,I don't like these headphones,The sound quality is ok but they can't trasmit very far less than 12' and anytime something blocks the direct path of the bluetooth on the headset you lose signal. I'm sorry I bought them and I should have done more research.
4,These are fantastic for the price,"I bought these for use with my Palm Pre. The pairing was a no-brainer. When I reconnect later it works without a hitch. The on-ear controls are great. They do not fall of my head, which is my biggest complaint about my RF headphones, while still being comfortable. This all said, I did use a $40 gift card to off-set the purchase, so the value to cost is a little weighted..."
4,great headset,"Sony does it again. This headset is the second wireless headset I've bought from Sony, the 1st is an RF headset that I've had for going on 4yrs. This bluetooth has great sound quality and fits without causing much ear discomfort, ie sweating during a hot day outside. Only con is not being able to charge via USB. Highly recommend!"
3,Great if you are not in a noisy environment. Else they kinda suck,"When I first used these at home I was excited and I loved everything about them. The minute I hit the bus I was extremely disappointed. For cans, I would have thought these were better than my meager noise isolating ear buds. I was wrong. These things pass noise like those junky earphones you get with iPods (the non-rubber ones). I can clearly hear the engine of the bus over these. As well as the noise of the sky train. If there was anything I could do to beef up the noise isolation, I'd do it in a heartbeat.PROS:Pretty much everything.CONS:-Noise isolation. :(-(small complaint) as one other reviewer mentioned, there's a tiny pause/cut-out from transmission about once per HOUR, so not really a big deal for me. I use these with my Google Nexus One.I pretty much bought these for transit use, so that's why I have only 3/5 stars. If you are not in a noisy environment, I highly recommend these."
2,Uncomfortable and not mac-compatible,"If you have a mac, don't buy these headphones. I'm fairly computer savvy and am utterly fed-up with the amount of time I've spent trying to get consistent performance out of these headphones. It just isn't worth the time. (I'm running Snow Leopard on a MacBook Air, for the record. I suppose they might couple better with other setups.)After much wrangling I've learned how to get them to couple with my computer, but it takes at least a minute or two of fiddling each time.Platform issues aside, they are only so-so headphones. The sound quality is OK, but something about the way they squeeze my head makes me nauseous after tens mins or so. I would not recommend them to anyone."
2,Major problems pairing with my Mac,"Its sound is about as good as you're going to get via Bluetooth. Comfort, construction, battery,... all pretty good, and life would be great IF ONLY I didn't have to go to the Sound Preference Pane to manually switch the Output to DR-BT50 EVERY TIME I try to use it; IF ONLY it could keep its connection active for more than an hour, not requiring me to turn it on and off again, which takes half a minute, as you have to hold the button for ~7 secs each time (why?!)! Sony, don't say Mac compatible unless you really test it on a Mac! Yes, I've tried pairing it more than once to try to fix this, but problems still arise and I'm a Mac expert!"
2,"Okay. Wouldn't buy again, though","I've had these for several months, now. The sound quality is actually very nice. Comfort is low. Your ears will be in pain after 15 to 20 minutes of use. I'm also very disappointed in the range. I've used these with several different bluetooth devices. In all cases I've had to be within a couple feet to avoid drop-outs. Any further than that and a simple head turn will drop signal. I've never seen BT headphones with such a short range."
2,Sony Bluetooth headset - Excellent Sound,"They sound great, but the ppower level is low. in noisy environments you cannot completely hear them."
3,Decent at best,"I originally purchased these for recording using Garage band on my mac. It seems as though the latency from the bluetooth speed is making this impossible. I was able to pair this with the mac relatively easily after turning off the headset functionality and got decent sound quality from Itunes but when it came to attempting to record music with them there was at best a second and a half delay between what the computer was playing and what I was hearing. I was also able to easily pair with Blackberry but the sound quality was Ok. Not worth the 100+ price tag and think it maybe should have come with a bluetooth adapter for ipod or Computer ""Dongle"" (I like that word, LOL) as well. I would say for half the price a good set of wired cans would do the job better and with less hassle."
2,Disappointment,"Cannot believe the hype written about this product.Bought this in Finland together with Logitech FreePulse. Sony is practically useless for classical music due to inferior, muddy sound quality. The earphones are comfortable, but controls are minuscule - push buttons for audio level are about 5 mm. You either control volume from audio source or draw off the earphones. Are these for pygmies?Check the product before buying. FreePulse audio quality is far better, at 40% cost of Sony.Tony Pohjanpalo"
3,"ok,but not a good option for iPhone.","It gets paired with iPhone but you cann't change the songs but you can answer the calls and see no issues with sound and the songs continue when you are done with the call. Good one , Still waiting for a better technology switching songs with iPhone.One more issue is because of hot climate it gets your ears more hot. Good in winter and not a good option in summer.Overall not disappointed with this product for the money I paid for, rather than purchasing an expensive equipment for the same features."
4,Works great with Iphone 3G,Paired this with my iphone 3G and Macbook intel duo and both work GREAT! I love this purchase I made and recommend them to any mac user.
4,Great headset for work!,"This headset is just about perfect for my situation. I was looking for something more comfortable than earbuds that I could use at work. Too short a cord would put my iPhone at risk of flying off the desk if I move too far too quickly. Long cords create even worse problems, so Bluetooth seemed the best bet. I was worried that there would be interference from all the other electronic devices in a normal office. There isn't. I've even experimented with moving around the office and from the kitchen to the conference rooms it works great.My only suggestion for an improvement is to mic. The current mic is located on the right earpiece. I feel like I need to speak loudly for the person on the other end of the call to hear me. A swing arm off the earpiece might make the mic more useful. As it is I use the headset to listen to music and take it off for calls."
4,good headset,"this headset quality is quite good on listen music, however, when it use for talking mobile phone, the quality is quite poor."
3,"Seems OK, could be better for the price.","Headphone sound reproduction quality is OK, not 'great' as I expected. Too much low range sound, lower response on mids and highs. This is good for generic music player and general listeners, not for music enthusiasts, who want clean and 'exact' sound from their music player."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"These are great headphones, the mic works great and the controls are easy to use. It holds a decent charge and doesn't fail in odd and unexplained ways. I have used it with my Atrix 4g and my Asus TF201, it has been flawless for 3 weeks now.The only thing I would change is the charger, I would prefer a micro USB charger since that is what everything else I own uses."
2,Bluetooth or Lemon?,"Not sure if my problems are due to the headphones or a bluetooth technology, I get static at the end and beginning of every song. Also speech and songs with little background noise sound terrible with hisses. When songs are playing it sounds pretty good but I enjoy listening to Podcasts too.Anyone else have any problems?"
3,Smaller than it looks.,"Took it out of the box, tried it on, and put it back in the box and returned it. It looks like it should fit over the ears, but it is pretty small, and actually rests on the ears. I was looking for something that completely encloses the ears.And this is nit-picky, but it charges using a dc power jack instead of a usb-type of connector. I'm getting quite used to and fond of wireless devices that charge using usb connectors."
2,"Great Item, but only moderate perfomance","I use headsets all the time. I got tired of the cord tangles and knocking over my coffee with the cord. I bought the Sony bluetooth headset. You have to read the manual to use this. But once I did, installation was a breeze. But I do have two problems I cannot resolve. 1) It doesn't work with Skype. It connects, but the audio is terrible. 2) Sometimes my mac cannot connect to the headset. If I pair the device again, it clears this up, but it is very annoying."
4,"Private, comfortable, and wireless","I bought these headphones because they are Bluetooth and I was tired of the wires and the ear buds falling out of my ear. I have a partner and a roommate that go to sleep early. They both work days sitting at a long table in the library in silence. I can now entertain myself without bothering anyone in the house.The sound is satisfactory. I use it for the TV or to stream music from my MacBook Pro, iPhone and iPad. When watching TV there is a slight delay due to the conversion process but I got used to it right away. These are not studio quality headphones but the sound is very satisfying for my particular needs.They are also much more comfortable to wear than ear buds.The range varies with walls and corners but if you're listening to you iTunes, I carry the phone around anyway. I have no real complaints."
1,POOR CONSTRUCTION,"This product has been a problem from the set-up to the operation of the headphones. It may be Bluetooth, but the headphones have to be continually paired with my Mac Pro Bluetooth Board to play. Once you get the proper pairing then the other problem crops-up with the extremely poor wiring of the headset. This particular headset will not play an entire song from any source without breaking-up continuously. The Headset is not worth any money at all and should be removed from market by Sony. I will never buy another Bluetooth Headset from Sony!"
2,Headset good sound quality BAD!,"This product has DEFINITE downfalls.....BLUETOOTH is an excellent technology, but it hasn't caught up with audio.frankly the audio sounds like COMPLETE CRAP... so if you want to listen to music FORGET IT!however if you NEED a headset that connects to bluetooth it is great... very comfrotable and easy to usealso there are no signed windows drivers for bluetooth yet so unless you're on a mac or a cell phone i wouldn't recommend wasting your time"
4,"high quality design, but some static","I use the product as headphones only for use with my laptop. The quality of the sound at times is perfect, but occasionally, the music program or movie needs to be paused and then continued in order to remove distortion that builds up.The battery life is unbelievable. I use them at least 3 hours a day and have only charged them fully maybe 3x's. A USB charging cable would have been nice, but the battery life is so long, I am surprising myself not to mind the dedicated charger.As for comfort, they are pretty good. After a few hours of wear, the bottoms of my earlobes do feel a pinch, but it is not significant."
4,"great sound quality, but not as comfortable as it looks","I bought this headset to pair up with a mackbook computer (be careful if you are planning to pair up any bluetooth headset with TIGER, for this OP DOESN'T SUPPORT BLUETOOTH STEREO SOUND, and it is a bit tricky to make it work). the sound is really good in both, the mac and a samsung cell phone. However, after 2 hours listening, my ears are very hot and even hurt. Maybe, i'm just not used to wear a heaset for that long. The product is great though, but if you have big ears, you may wanna consider another pair.I strongly recommend the motorola S9. It's light and discreet with the same sound quality. I wish I had read this review before buying this big hedaset. :)"
3,Good with a few caveats,"Sound quality is equivalent to a wired headset. Microphone is not the best, only good for quick uses, or perhaps conferences where you will only be speaking very briefly. I count on the headset only to allow me to hear the phone ring, then to turn off the headset and ti then use the phone normally.The biggest disappointment is comfort. The ear cups are a little small, and leave my with mine discomfort in a shirt time."
4,Not the best solution for the PS3,"I was interested in getting these headphones because they have a built in microphone, which would be very helpful with the PS3. Note that the PS3 will only transfer ""chat"" through it's bluetooth. Meaning, all game sounds are still routed through the television or your stereo receiver.These would have been a slam dunk, but the BT stack the PS3 uses will not allow the transfer of game sounds through bluetooth."
3,"Lightweight, comfortable, not so great sound",Used it as a transmitter for TV. Works great if you are sitting in one place. Not good if you move around and still want too keep listening.The Good:Setup was a breeze.Lightweight and comfortable.The Bad:Expensive for what it does NOT offer.Not so great sound.Small area of reception.More problems when there is a wall between you and the transmitter.I lost reception easily when I moved about 20 feet on to the porch (wall in between).
2,Not Satisfied,"Although the sound reproduction is good and pairing is easy, my voice is not receive at the other end very well during conversations. I think this product must be re-design. I ended up buying another blue tooth headset from Plantronics Discovery 925"
3,"Yeah, it's OK","Bluetooth will never bring you the sound quality of cable... This headset is comfortable but gets easily parasited in a work environment.Not saying it's Sony's fault, but let's face it, we live in a wireless world and Bluetooth devices are very sensitive devices.If you can, stick to a regular audio jack ah!"
3,After 19 Months Broke,"this headphone sounds great it has good bass, mids but after 19 months of carefully used it easily break plastic in the headphone holder. cheap materials sony should do a better materials on it."
5,Overall Great product.,I purchased these headphones as well as the Sony two way bluetooth adapter to use with my television. Both products were easy to set up and easily pair up time and time again. I also have the headphones paired with my Motorola Droid phone and Archos 70IT tablet. The sound quality when using with my phone and tablet is unbelievably great. Not so much when using the adapter. It isn't terrible but it isn't the same as with the other poducts.
2,Too many flaws,"(1) It's phone function is bad, barely acceptable in a very quite environment, speaking with a patient party. Utterly unacceptable for the conversations in a noisy or windy environment.(2) It's unusable in the proximity of my Panasonic microwave, though not at work near my GE microwave(3) There are occasional quirks when the connection momentarily is lost, for no apparent reason(4) While it's battery life is good, you can't swap another battery into it, neither you can use its charger in Europe, since it's 110 Volts only (While vast majority of electronics can automatically switch between 110 and 220 volts !)"
4,Bad mic,"Overall it is great. It is very comfortable to wear, it has good speakers, it is easy to use, and what else can i say it is bluetooth. The one downside is the mic, evertime i call someone they can hardly understand what i am saying. They tell me it sounds muffled. I tried it on three different phones to multiple different people. But as I said before overall it is great(for listening to music)."
1,Beware,"It synced and played music perfectly, but phone reception was terrible. The other people could hear me fine, but the sound i received was intermittent, distorted, and had a brrrrrrr ringing echo to every sound, even the ringing when i made a call.I could not make out what the other people were saying at all.I looked in trouble shooting, and it says the unit can get ""interference from a wireless LAN, other 2.4 GHz wireless device, or microwave oven."" Shocking! Where someone can go these days where none of these other devices are operating? i went 30 feet outside my house and it was just as bad.Or maybe the one i got is just a lemon. I don't know.I called SONY and they said to try the reset, but i'd already done that, so they offered to let me send it to them so a techie could look at it. I'm returning it in stead."
2,Not for talking,"The microphone on the headset is overly sensitive. So sensitive, that my peer can not hear me while I walk from a relatively quiet street - background noises cover my speech, making the headset useless."
3,"awsome sound , bad microphone",i bought these primerily for talking on the phone people said they could not make out what i was saying (mabe i just got a lemon) however for just listening to music these are probly the best on the market they really sound incredible
2,False Promises,"This book promises success with minimal follow-up within three days. This has not been the case with our two year old son. It has taken 3-4 weeks for him to fully understand the concept and he still is not telling us when he needs to go. The book says if you are firm and consistant within three days the child will fully understand and begin pottying on their own. Not true. It really depends on the child. Some children grab the idea and run with it, others are interested but not enough to quit playing to go to the potty. The only thing this book did was jump start us into a no-return zone. Once the underwear went on no diapers have been used, which is great advice from the book. This book should be used for ideas only. You know your child better than anyone else, only you and your child know what works for you. Don't be afraid to do your own thing. After all the child is only 2!"
4,Very realistic and works,"I bought this book when we were potty training our son. He seemed to take longer than most kids...but this book is really good and really gives you a great start at potty training. You need to have a weekend where you go nowhere to get them jumpstarted, but be realistic in the fact that they are not truly potty trained in a few days...they will have slipups...I am looking forward to trying this with my little girl as she hates to be messy in her britches. :-)"
2,Disappointed with the author!,"Some parts are helpful. Or the most part I do not agree with the authors tone and attitude towards the child. My daughter is doing great with traing, but she is extremely stubborn. If I push her too much, as suggested in this book, it would backfire. Not to mention the author is ridiculous stating if your child doesn't get it they have a learning disorder. What a bunch of b.s. maybe they are just not developmentally ready. Don't waist your money!"
3,Good for basic potty training principles,"I was all gung ho to stick to every detail of this method, but as soon as I took my daughter to her nanny, we ended up having to make some modifications. We did end up going to pull-ups because it was just too stressful at night and during the day because even after 3 weeks, our daughter still has accidents (mind you they are few). All in all, I felt like the first three days using this method was very beneficial, but after that, we had to do what worked for our family and not stress out about it. It should be a fun process and not something that stresses you out needlessly. I would recommend this book, but I'd give the disclaimer that you have to modify the methods based on your lifestyle. Like the author says, it's your attitude about it all that makes it work."
1,I would not purchase again,"This book is really a pamphlet, only a few pages with huge words on each page to make it look like a book. There is nothing new, nothing creative, nothing helpful in this book. Basically tells you the same thing you can get for free out of any book or website on potty training. Throw away the diapers, spend 3 days with the same caregiver, take them to the restroom every hour. An absolute waste of money, I am disappointed Amazon would even sell this ""book."" Not helpful. And no, my child is still not potty trained."
2,this is not good!!!,If an item looks to good to be true then it must be. Im on day number 2 and i feel like I'm going insane!! You can set ur child on the potty but can't make them go. And it's not the parents fault all the time.
1,What a joke,"I was hopeful, but it wasn't enough. Even by following this ""book"" to the letter, 2 weeks and still not potty trained. This may work with a select group of children, but not mine. And not any of my friend's children either. This really isn't a book at all....more like a pamphlet. Certainly not worth the price paid."
1,Did not work for us,This book simply did not do the trick for my family. The strictly regimented potty training process did nothing but frustrate my daughter and myself. We were so stressed out after the first day that I threw the book out all together. We then began our own style of potty training and my little girl was using the toilet regularly in a matter of days. This book was a waste of $ for me. :(
3,very basic,"i've could have written this book. very basic tips, take your child to the potty every hour, buy big girls' underwear, make sure to have a positive attitude, etc. noting i found really helpful that i didnt already know fm talking to other moms."
1,Unrealistic,"This did not work at all for my 21 month year old daugher. She showed a couple of signs of being ready to potty train, which according to the author was all that was needed but she clearly wasn't ready. The only thing the author says about if it doesn't work is that your child may have a learning disability. That's ridiculous. Following the steps in this book caused my daughter unbelievable stress and anxiety. I stopped after the second day and her not successfully going in the potty even once and being so stressed out she no longer even wanted to take a bath (which she always loved). I recommend not following the advice in this book and really waiting until your child is ready. I plan to wait until she's at least 2 to try again."
1,Did not work for us,"This book did not work for us at all. I tried very hard to follow all her points/ideas, but ended up deciding our 2 year old was not ready. He kept thinking he'd gone in the potty when he hadn't gone. According to her list of points, he was ready, but it was apparant once we started, he was not. Now he keeps putting his potty in the closet, and telling me ""No potty"" so we're taking a break. And when I start again, I will not use this book to help guide me through the process."
3,So-So,"I have to admit I am pretty clueless when it comes to parenting. I wing it most of the time. I felt like I needed some assistance in tackling potty training for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter. We have been putting it off for way too long; especailly since the birth of our son. The book was really a breeze to get through. But knowing nothing about potty training, I really dont think I got anything out of the book either. Basically throw out the diapers, watch your child like a hawk for the first three days, take them to the bathroom every hour, and praise them. Simple enough. If I did take away anything from this book it was more of reasurance and motivation to get started."
1,FAKE AND MISLEADING,This method DOES NOT WORK IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I followed this verbatum. Even added 2 extra days. My son is smart. This just doesn't work.
5,Amazing!!,"I used Kleint's techniques to potty train my two-and-a-half-year-old boy, and the whole process was SO easy. He was actually potty trained by the second day, and has been trained and accident-free for three months now. I'm the envy of other moms in my neighborhood because my son is completely trained at a relatively young age. (That includes staying dry during naps and through the night.) I cannot recommend this practical, compassionate guide enough.I also read ""Toilet Training in Less Than a Day"" by Azrin and Foxx, but I think Kleint's book offers a more sane approach. If you're facing the task of potty training a toddler, do yourself a HUGE favor and read this book first!"
5,Potty Train n three days,"I have a three old boy who wouldn't or wasn't interested in potty training. A friend with a boy the same age as my son, recommended this book and believe it or not - it worked. I followed the book's instructions to the letter and my son was happy to be doing it and wanted to do it. After the second day it was over - he was potty trained and two months later he hasn't had an accident in his bed overnight - just a few times while playing. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to start to potty train their child."
3,Interesting,We tried to do this after reading the book with our 2 and a half year old son. I don't know if I can blame it on his age or his gender but he still has accidents and it's been 2 months now. Unfortunately he still does not stay dry during nap or nighttime...
1,Not worth the stress,"This book came highly recommended from several people that had used and swore by this method. One would have to have a cold heart and nerves of steel to follow the steps EXACTLY in the book, as is strongly encouraged. If parents out there can teach their kids to use the potty, change their pants and wipe their own bum in three days, then you all deserve a medal. Call me Mommie Dearest, but I could not watch my 2 year old struggle for 20 minutes and cry and beg me for help when he could not pull up his own pants after an ""accident"" nor could I sleep on the floor of his bedroom and wake him in the middle of the night to use the potty. I'm sure there are other books out there that provide realistic potty training direction with more compassion and kindness."
2,Offensive,I have worked with special needs children for more than 10 years. I found it extremely offensive that the author suggests if her methods do not work then there must be a compounding reason. Children all learn differently; one approach may not be the answer for everyone.
2,Incomplete and misleading,"While this book might provide a good platform for beginning potty training, it is incomplete and misleading. It really does not address teaching your child to 'poop' in the potty and that makes the title misleading. It also seems to be predicated on the idea that all children are the same when it comes to this topic. The assumption that all children are ready by the age of two is fundamentally rubbish. Children are different and parents' approach must be tailored to that child's needs. We saw some initial success with the methods outlined in this book, however, nearly a year after beginning, we have a three and half year old son who seems to have 'defied' most of the principals this book laid out. I could not recommend it in good conscience."
1,Potty Train in Three Days,"This book is some sort of mind-control prgram for toddlers. It goes against everything that I as a mother believe in, such as allowing your child to take the lead, treating accidents and bedwetting as an unavoidable part of potty training instead of an opportunity to ""teach"" your child to NOT have such accidents, and other sorts of ""tips"" that would appear to work better for training a dog than a child. My child is not a ""trainable"" dog - he is a small person who deserves my respect and care and compassion. And to be told that a child still in diapers at 3 years of age is a horrible disservice to that child flies in the face of all that is held true in the medical community today. The fact is, very few children are trainable at 18 - 24 months as this woman claims. But she points her finger squarely at parents as irresponsibly keeping their children ""babies"" longer than necessary, and longer than what is healthy for the child. An awful, mind-control form of potty training."
1,no such thing as training in 3 days!,"I should have been wiser before buying this book, and believing it could work in 3 days. Better get this book from someone else who read it, u can always get some tips!"
2,Not my favorite,"I love the Sims, it is a nice break from reality. But this one, I do not like the way you move them. There is a cursor like thing that you move then you push a button to move them to where the cursor is. A real pain. You cannot move the character as you can in some of the other games. Graphics are good, I just wish I was in more direct control of my person."
4,Played my son's game for hours...,"It started with my son telling me about the game. Then he showed me. Then I played....for hoooours ...and forgot to go to bed.It's fun. From creating your character, through completing your goals. Have them clean up after themselves, or get a maid. Decorate your home, or completely reorganize it. Chat with your friends on the phone, visit them, throw a party or even ignore them. No matter how old you are, you'll find it entertaining.Parents!If you're tired of explaining your kids why they have to clean up after themselves, and how annoying it is when you have to ask them a 100 times, get this game! :o)"
1,Sims Review,"This order was canceled by the seller as soon as it was processed , no reason. Never got the game. Not a good experience."
5,Great But There Is Still Room For Improvement!,"This is a great game but of course there is still room for improvement. First, I was hoping for the ability to make an upstairs portion of a house. Not that this is vital but it would've been nice. Though I must say that the single player or ""bustin' out"" portion of the game is more fun than it was on the first sims console game even though it's basically the same thing. The animation and graphics of the xbox truly make this game more of a pleasure to play. Damn those pixels! I would've been great if you had the option of removing the pixels for when the sims are nude."
4,Best Xbox Game Ever!,"This game is incrediable. The graphics [are great]. All the new stuff you can do,sim customizing. This game is 5 stars all the way. This game is by far the best sim game out their. I know because I have five of the computer ones. And after playing the first sims game for xbox I know the second one is only going to be 2x the more fun and intertaining.So buy this game.And in the words of a sim: This whoaw is fredishay."
4,Sims Bustin Out,"The game is excellent in helping you learn how life will be when you're older. Not only that, but it teaches you how to become successful and how to prepare when incidents happen whether good or bad. It also shows the differennce between living single, married or with children. In my opinion, it's good example on how to your life will be depending on the desicions and lifestyle you choose."
5,Livin Life,"Ok this game is a game that any age will like.Beacause it is funn and sorda educational.Its basicly about a sim crated by you and you have to make sure he is socialy healthy,has good hygene ,isnt bored,slept enough ,has a clean enviorment(not important,and that has used the toilet,and is not hungry.The Graphics -I would give 2 starsAudio-could be better all you here is cars passing bye or screams could of been done better i give it 0 stars.Game Play-The gameplay is excelent You pretty much do what ever you want.You can visit friends,gossip,eventuly have kids,work out,pretty much shape this sim into the deepest creation from the pits of your mind,or what ever the heck your like.So I give the game play for the Sims Bustin Out 3 STARS.Overall a great game for young and old."
3,nothing new,"It's a very nice game, but I was expecting much more. There is no big difference between both Sims games."
4,Sims Bustin' Out Ratings,"Sims Bustin' Out is really good value for the price to buy it. First, I think some kids should be at least 10-11 to play. The reason is that some of the Sims' you create want to kiss with another Sim,not for the young eye to see.....if you parents know what I mean. Sims Bustin' Out does show kids a bit of reality, though, how you have to balance your schedule with cooking, cleaning the house and your Sim,your Job,and paying bills, etc. So I gave the educantional rating a 3, half n' half because of the romnace part. It is very durable and I think kids would enjoy playing it. I rate this toy 4 stars overall."
1,This game sucks,This game is so stupid. All the game contains is stupid fake people running around. I can't beleive I bought it.
3,disturbing,"After reading this book I cannot believe that any mother would feel it acceptable in any way to leave her Autistic child in the care of children, on page 147 chapter thirteen of her book Wendy Robinson states that while her son Grant was staying with the scout group at camp Mohawk her son was left in the care of two boys aged 11 and 12, one of these boys she states stayed up all night to care for Grant indeed sleeping on a chair with his head resting against a wall so that if he fell asleep the chair would fall and wake him. Wendy Robinson states that her son had fits particularly around 5.am, I struggle to understand how any mother could leave their child in the care of two boys who were only children theirselves, even more so as Grant was Autistic and had fits. These boys were also expected to clean up and wash Grant when his toilet signals were missed, no child should be expected to do that, this scout master in my opinion should not have been caring for children Autistic or otherwise."
4,Unconditional Love = Reality = Hope = Acceptance,"Good read, truthful and concise. A bit out of reach for most parents in terms of funding. UK seems to be much more liberal and accessable than parts of the USA. Wendy (the Mom) received incredible amounts of support form her community and seemed not to have issues with asking for help, or freely discussing her son's condition with anyone showing interest. After reading many medical books (I have a 6 yr old son that autism took 4 years ago) this was a shot in the arm as well as a much needed tear or two. Inspiring to say the least, I recommend it to any parent of an autistic child."
5,Gentle Giant is a must to read for any parent,"Gentle Giant is a must to read for any parent especially parents with autistic children. Wendy Robinson's portrayal of her son Grant is a beautifully poignant story. Only a parent of a child like Grant can understand what it is like to live with autism in the family. Wendy Robinson gets this across brilliantly, sadly when I read this book I already knew the outcome of the story so that slightly spoilt it for me however it is a book that I could read again and again. Having an autistic son myself I can relate to most of the storys that Wendy tells about Grant. It is a book that can make you laugh and definitely make you cry. I must say that Wendy must have had tremendous courage to write this book but her sense of humour and the love for her son and family shines through. It is also a tribute to the very necessary people who work with children who have special needs."
3,Fabric Storage Boxes,"Higher Denier needed for towels and heavier items. Flimsy at best, handles break loose under medium pressure, but useful for light bulky items like potato chips, bread, snacks, etc, when we go camping."
5,Excellent boxes,I love these boxes! They are soft enough so I can leave them out with toys in them for my child to get out on his own. They fold compactly when I'm not using them. And they look great in my blue family room. I just wish they sold each of the sizes separately so i could get more of the small ones to put in a shelving unit.
2,a disappointment,"From the description, I thought these would be a lot more sturdy. They're fine for storing light weight items that you don't need to access often. But I found that the plastic supports tended to break through the fabric at the corners and break in half if stressed."
4,Good for young kids; but better for senior kids/adults,"I purchased this set of boxes for my 3-year-old kid to store his toys. They are strong enough, with good design and reasonable price. However, my kid, not understanding what they are for, loves to fold them or to enter them. While we still use them for kid's toy storage, they might work better for senior kids and adults."
3,Ehh it's ok,"I really like the cranes they are cute and fun to use. The chopsticks are blah--I have better and the box it cardboard so...if only for the cranes I think it's worth it. Otherwise, you may want to pass on this purchase."
5,never fails,it can open everything without fail. Everytime i try the most impossible it works. great mounting idea and helps with the gripping and turning too. would highly recommend this product.
2,Not impressed,"Have arthritis and thought this would be great, but it is hard to get it to work and requires a lot more strength than you might think. Would not buy again."
5,The Meanest Doll in the World,I ordered this book for my nine year old granddaughter to read during her visit this summer. She read it within two days and loved it. I do recommend this series.
5,Glad to see the Dolls again!,"Oh, I was so glad to see a sequel (and there's a apparently a third!) I hope we get to revisit the other house with the new dolls, they seemed to have pretty interesting stories. I'm glad to finally see confirmation of a permanent doll state--wonder if that has any future implications for the next book? Same with the spiders, that whole discussion with Aunt Sarah never really came to anything. Anyways, this book, just like its predecessor, had an imaginative plot, and I was very glad that we actually got to leave the house and see their school, as well as interaction with new dolls. It brings up new ideas about the rules (I'm personally intrigued by the action figure rule) that I think should be further explored. Really, I just loved seeing all the dolls together again, it was awesome."
5,She's Here,"The book I read was called The Meanest Doll in the World. I would recommend this book to kids of all ages because it had a great moral to it and there were many shocking and fun things that happened.The main characters are dolls named Annabelle, Tiffany Funcraft, and Mimi, the meanest doll in the world. Annabelle and her best friend Tiffany Funcraft go on a great adventure to there owner's, Nora and Kate, school. When they step out of a backpack they find themselves in a different home,. There they meet Mimi and go through many adventures and also meet many other types of dolls they have never seen or met in there life.This book was read and enjoyed by myself, my mother and my 14 year old sister. That is why I think many schools should have this book in their library.By: Danielle"
5,The Greatest Book in the World!!!!!!,"After reading The Meanest Doll in the World, I was unable to look at my dolls in my doll house the same way again. True, dolls are not alive, but one can never know. The only thing that may be scary to a younger age group is the thought of a horrifying doll walking around a house plotting disasterous schemes to jepordize not only herself but all of her kind. That kind of frightened me but I remebered that dolls are not alive and if a doll did something to me it wouldn't be all that harmful. So, as you can see, The Meanest Doll in the World is a great book that shows how even dolls can work together to conquer an evil villian and shows the meaning of friendship between Annabelle and Tiffany, two of the dolls in this book."
5,Love this series!,"My 7 and 4 year old kids (a boy and a girl) LOVED this series. Note that this is the 2rd book, and probably the scariest of the 3. So if you have a child who is easily scared, you may want to wait a year or two. I also loved reading this series out loud to them, although I know some of my son's 2nd grade friends read it on their own."
1,Quality not as stated,Was rated as good and had ink scribbling all over the inside of the book. I was not happy with the quality of the book.
4,The Evil Doll,"If you are a reader that likes an adventure where you'll find someone you wished you never met, you should read this book, because it makes you wonder what's going to happen next. Annebelle and Tiffany ( the protagonists) are very adventurous. You want to read more about Mean Mimi (the antagonist). This book is a very thought-provoking book. I liked this book so much I would read it again."
2,not as great as i thought,i used it the discolored spot for 3 wks now.. did not see any improvement. the cream itself is kinda thick. when i use it overnight or through out the day my face got more oily than usual. I will not buy this product again.
5,Meow-a-licious!!!,"Mumzy states that this is a most wonderful product. It is quite gentle, pleasant smelling and works exceedingly well. This product is from England. Historically, it is a well established product. This is always a very good sign, because whenever a product has longevity, that indeed says something about the product. Results are not seen overnight, however with continued use, it evens out the skin tone, and fades out the dark spots and discolorations...Thus, making one look younger. The wonderful thing about this cream is that one may use it both during the day, and at night as well: Not only does it keep your skin soft, but it also makes the imperfections fade away. Too bad it is not for pussycats. If it were,--- we would use it,--- and then the neighborhood mice would not see us coming!!!Phffft!---So there!!!Ko-Ko the Cat"
5,Excellent Book,"This book is part of the Holy Trinity of books I use to teach myself the culinary arts. For those of us who can't afford culinary school, this book is great. After mastering the techniques discussed in such a detailed and interesting fashion in this book, you could bake anything. They have tons of recipes and scientific explanations and calculations so you can make perfect foodstuffs. Would highly recommend."
5,This book covers all topics of baking,A great book and it helped me get through my baking course. I also bought the Study Guide for the National Servsafe Exam: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations ISBN 0971999678 also on Amazon. This study guide help me understand the importance of handling dairy products especially eggs to prevent Salmonella and other Food borne illnesses. It also helped my study group and I pass the National Servsafe Exam with ease. Buy the first book definitely for your baking class and buy the second book for the Servsafe Exam.
4,Sony non earbuds,Earbuds just don't work for me. These headphones are a reasonable companion to my iPad. Decent sound. Very comfortable. Easy controls.
5,Better Bluetooth headset from Sony,"It's an awesome bluetooth piece available in the line of bluetooth headsets. The sound quality is far better and louder than Motorola bluetooth I used before. I'm satisfied with my purchase. The controls on the headphone is easy to control. The operation is exactly s mentioned in its description, 11 hrs voice and music. It folds so easy to store in bag or sometimes even in my jacket pocket. I definitely recommend this to the user who wants to get rid of wires between phone and mobile."
4,Sony Headset,Good product. Good fidelity and comfortable. Only downside is a problem with Bluetooth itself -- audio is delayed enough to be noticeable when when viewing a video or TV. If speakers are on at the same time it is very annoying.
4,Sony DRBT21G/B,"I'm going to compare this to a Jabra BT620 that I own. The Sony has a little bit more of an 'airy' sound, but not as much bass. The Sony weighs a little less than the Jabra which allows me to keep it on longer, although both of them tend to squeeze my ear area which becomes uncomfortable after about 30 to 40 minutes. Still, I like both of them, the Jabra because I like the bass and the Sony because it's lighter."
3,poorly designed fit,"The sound is good, but the fit is not. While initially the headphones are reasonably comfortable, they slide down your ears if you move. The edges of the connector are sharp and start to hurt your ears. I had to return them."
1,The sound is horrible for the price,The sound cracks and pop. all music sounds bad on this head phone. I'm suprised it is sony.
3,"Great product, but ...","well, the product is great, stereo sound, easy to connect to computer and stuff but the only problem is, it dose not have a USB connection with a laptop to charge it.The reason that I need a USB charge is because I travel a lot and electricity is not the same everywhere.This is the only thing I didn't like about this headset, other than that everything is great!"
1,I'm returning them,"I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these. I get clicks, pops and static no matter what device I'm listening from. If you care about how your music sounds, don't waste your money on these. I'm returning mine tomorrow and buying a set of wired headphones."
4,Works really good.,"I use this headset with my iPhone. It works really good for both listening to music and using as a headset for phone calls. I've had other devices that i used with the iPhone and people always complained that my headset was not transmitting good. So far, no complaints on this one. It can be a little uncomfortable above the ear on the temple when wearing it for long periods of time, otherwise, a great device."
1,Not recommended,I couldn't get the bluetooth connection to work easily. It was very difficult and time consuming - trying and retrying. When it did work the folded headphone design doesn't fit tightly so there is a lot of outside noise.I do not recommend this product except for use with a PC in a quite area. Not good for trains or for treadmills. Also you need to be very patient to get it to connect.Surprised Sony couldn't do better.
3,Great headphones... while they last.,"I owned these headphones from April through July of this year. They had excellent reception, clear audio, and a great feature set. Then, after four months of use, they began to arbitrarily turn on and off, eventually reaching the point where I could no longer control them at all. Now they're in the trash.Don't buy this product if you expect to use them every day, they wear out too easily."
1,Not really that good.,"I had several problems with it:1. Didn't fit my head really well, and the way it pushed my ears into the ""slots"" made them sore. It also just didn't feel that secure on my head.2. It paired fine, but it cuts out like I read on other reviews. I tried it on a laptop computer (Dell XPS 1330) along with a HTC Touch Pro. It cut out with both devices at random times.I really don't have any reason to rate this product over 1 star.However, I did buy the Sony Ericsson HBH-DS200 and that thing works great. I've never had it cut out and I pair it with the laptop and Touch Pro with no issues at all."
1,uncomfortable,"The headset did not fit very well, they just did not work for me so I returned them immediately. They felt like they were falling off all of the time and did not fit tight to my ears. I cannot comment on their performance, I never even tried to get them to work with my laptop or phone because I could not stand the way they felt on my head."
2,Not for outdoor usage,"The Sony Bluetooth headset works well indoors, but once you step outside you slowly start to lose your reception. I have only used this on my cell, so I am not sure how these headphones will work with an mp3 player."
2,NO MUTE and background noise is loud - what an oversight!,"I had high hopes for this headset, having researched it and read many reviews. It has one major flaw, NO MUTE button and no way to program the multi-function button to have that function. Which means if you use this with phones like the VTech DS6321 there is no way to use the headset and mute a call. The mute on the Vtech phone only operates when you are speaker on using the handset, which is also lame.Top that off with the fact that the tiny outward facing microphone picks up EVERYTHING around it. Makes it virtually useless as a phone headset. On any call even in quite environments the called party hears what sounds like a fan nearby!!!Works great as a stereo listening headset..."
4,superb headset at this pricepoint,"Just got these to pair with an LG enV and my laptop using a bluetooth USB dongle, and I'm more than happy with the results.Audio is very clear, good bass response, good dynamic range, I'd have to say they're even better than similar over-the-ear wired headphones by Sony I've used in the past.My only complaint is the 'folding' mechanism - they don't fold flat, so they might be likely to break if you stuff them in a full bag. It would've been a better idea to make them adustable instead of folding - they're far too large for my girlfriend's head, though they fit my (rather large) head very well. Been wearing them for about 6 hours straight with little discomfort."
3,"Great sound, poor reception","I have another pair of larger Sony bluetooth headphones (DR-BT22A) and they seem to get pretty decent reception, so I thought I would try these since they seem a little more 'action' oriented. Alas, the reception was so bad I couldn't move more than about 3 feet from my laptop before the signal would cut out. The audio quality is very impressive, as it is on my other pair of Sony bluetooth headphones. There's a fair amount of bass considering these are running on a pretty small battery and the actual earpieces aren't all that big. Unfortunately I couldn't live with the very short range so I returned them and ordered a set of ""Iqua"" bluetooth headphones, which I haven't gotten yet."
5,Such a fun book to read! Always has our kids laughing!,"This book is so much fun to read and whether they are smiling or laughing, our kids love this story and it is always a top pick! We bought it because we have a Jeep, but continue to read it on an almost daily basis because we love it!"
2,4 year old learning to read was really bored.,"I purchased this for a four-year-old who is starting to learn how to read. Given the rave reviews for this book, I thought it would be a big hit. But it's really slow paced, and still a very quick read. I appreciate a good children's book, but this one bored me as well. It just has a few words on each page, and long spells of just music, I suppose so the child can take in what's going on on the page, which isn't a whole lot.The one good thing about this book was that it was his first read-along and he learned how to turn the pages when signaled, so he knew exactly what to do with his second read-along,Poetry Speaks to Children (Book & CD) (Read & Hear), which he loves."
2,Sheep in a Jeep,Sheep in a Jeep is a fun book using rhythmic wording. The pictures are humorous. My disappointment was with the small size of the board book. No where did it say the miniature dimensions of the book. I prefer board books that are in the larger format of 8x11.
2,Very average book!,"I wouldnt recommend this. My 2-yr old didnt seem to enjoy this. not very educational, IMO. opt for something better...."
4,Cracks my son up!,"I bought this for my two year old because his Mema drives a Jeep and he is obsessed with cars. He gets such a kick out of this book and laughs everytime we get to the part where the ""Jeep's in a heap"". At first I didn't like that fact that it is written in fragments and not sentences, but that's my hang up. He likes it and that's who it's for!"
5,best of the sheep books,"This is the best of the Shaw/Apple sheep series. I enjoy it (and if you're reading a book over and over, that helps!) and I haven't found a two year old yet who doesn't like it at least a little. (Some like it more than a little.)"
4,"A great book, not for a very young baby though...","The story is great, but the words that are used in this book are long vowels which is, for my 7 mo baby,short vowel sounds might be more simple and attractive."
4,Good for a young reader,My five year old granddaughter could read this all by herself. It's a great book for a beginning reader.
5,Sheep in a Jeep can't be beat!,I was first introduced to this book when a friend's toddler received it for Christmas. He loved it. That was 5 or 6 years ago. Recently we found it at the library and my boys loved it so much that we bought our own. My 2yo son loves it and even the 4yo still asks to read it. It's a keeper!
1,Can't read on Kindle,"I object to this being called a Kindle edition. Unlike other toddler books I have purchased for the Kindle, this one is unreadable."
5,Kids LOVE this book,"This is one of the best early children's books. The illustrations are fantastic, and the words are fun to say aloud. The rhyming pattern is reminiscent of Seuss, and teaches phonological awareness in the same fun way. My son laughed and laughed at the sheep; and every child I've subsequently gifted with the book has loved it just as much."
4,"Simple Story, Great Pictures",A very simple read but nicely illustrated. Good for reading to toddlers and by young readers but the in-betweens might find it too insubstantial.
3,Just ok.,i think this book is for age 2 to 3. My kids did not really like it and the story was just ok.
5,Sheep in a Jeep,"I have had this book for a long time. Because of the repetition, it is a great tool for children learning to read."
2,Sheep Plot Line Cheap.,"I know that many have said this is one of there favorites, however I found the plot line and rhyming scheme very much lacking.Sadly disappointed but glad others enjoyed it."
4,Nancy Shaw Has a Hit,"Those crazy adolescent sheep are at it again, and this time they've hotwired a jeep. Okay, let's be honest right from the start and admit that this one is not up to the standards set by ""Sleep in the Deep,"" but that comparison doesn't seem to matter much to the legions of parents and kids who love the off-road sheep.The plot is pretty basic. The characterizations are a thin. But every page rhymes, and that's got to count for something, and besides, it's a sit-com with sheep, not Hamlet. Overall, this reviewer gives three thumbs up for Sheep in a Jeep. I didn't give it five stars because my own little girl seems to be ignoring the book so far. Could be the other 500 books in her room are distracting her and she just hasn't noticed this one yet."
5,Heaps of fun. A great present for beginning readers.,"These hapless creatures are absolutely fun and provide youngsters with a most satisfying storytime. Alliterative, rhyming verse and adventure make these ideal for motivating youngsters to read. See also Sheep in a shop, Sheep out to eat, and Sheep on a ship by the same author. See also Mem Fox's ""Where is the Green Sheep?""Suitable presents for home collections."
1,"wonderful book, horrid ebook","This is a review for the kindle edition. The book itself is great, but the e version is not. The words and pictures don't match up, and each picture and its associated words repeat numerous times. Really frustrating to read. Just get the print version."
4,Nice and funny first reader,"Cute, first reader. Rhymes and flows nicely. My 4 year old liked it, and my six year old read it easily."
5,Great rhyming book,Cute story and it rhymes. Enjoyed by 2 years to 6 or 7. Good illustrations. Can talk about the various emotions shown by the sheep in this adventure.
1,Applies only to Kindle,"I don't know what possessed Amazon to run this as a deal of the day. It would not download to some devices, and on those it did download to the formatting was atrocious. The Kindle edition needs serious work - go buy the physical book."
3,"Good reference, but needs an index","Overall this is a good book for looking something up, but an index at the end of the book would be very helpful. Without it, you have to thumb through page-by-page and find what you're looking for. Maybe in the 2nd edition.If the index had been there, it definitely would have gotten four stars.The book could stand a couple of examples, too, maybe with a CGI program to show the practical application of the information."
5,The best book for HTTP,"I bought two books on HTTP. This one and a very forgetable doorstop of a book. This was by far my favorite. It is only about 70 pages or so, but contains everything I need. I wish I could say this about every book I buy.If you are planning to work with Java Servlets or CGI, you should get this book."
5,A wealth of useful information,"I have written a number of embedded web servers, and in the process I've completely worn out one copy of this book and have quite a bit of wear and tear on my 2nd copy. For a while it looked like it might go out of print, but I'm very glad to see that it is still available.Don't let the old copyright date put you off. This is NOT ""old and out of date"" information, but is very useful for people who work with HTTP from time to time."
4,"It's good, but takes patience.","Often this film is criticized for its slow pacing and laborious character development. How is that? I enjoyed being able to watch these actors, especially John Malkovich, sink their teeth into the characters. One great payoff, if one is interested, is that it does not talk down to your intelligence and makes the film slightly more believable. It helps if you think you know a character. It is more of a film, rather than a skit, like so many of these Hollywood pictures turn into.My only criticism would have been a more fulfilling end sequence, but, hey, maybe I am preconditioned to by-the-number endings.Also, the dialog in this film is impeccable, as is John Malkovich's acting. Give it a shot."
4,Malkovich at his best,"The movie is by no means a masterpiece, however I am sure most would agree that John Malkovich's sly delivery of the Ripley charector will make anyone who is a fan of cinema ignore all that lacking glamore, that usually comes from bigger hollywood productions. Malkovich is the best part of this movie and to be honest that is easily enough. He appears to be born to play this role. See this movie if you like movies today his acting/charector is like a thunderbolt, he grows on you and doesn't let go."
4,not your usual thriller,"but it draws you in. At first it seems slow-moving, but then the bodies start to pile up. At times it is darkly funny. Malkovich is great -- he really is a bad guy and yet I found myself rooting for his success. None of the other reviewers (maybe they had more familiarity with the underlying book?) thought the Ripley character changed at all during the film, but I find myself wondering - if he is as conscienceless as he claims -- and usually appears -- to be, why the heroics? I recommend this movie as pure entertainment."
3,I love Ripley's Game! Sort of.,"Did I say John Malkovich was an aquired taste? I guess I've just aquired it, then. His mannered style is just right for this gem of a script. Actually, I loved this film the first time, but found it utter crap upon second viewing. Go figure. It's still pretty funny, though, if superficial.I was expecting a formulaic plot in which the Dougray Scott character is pulled into nasty machinations by Ripley and it ends with some sort of showdown between the two in which the Scott character probably comes off worse. I was totally right, but also, totally wrong. The way it goes is totally unexpected, and a laugh. Scott nails the whole British thing. The bulldog in him is prised out with chilling ease.Both characters end up experiencing some sort of epiphany, and at the film's close you are left with questions you really don't want to begin to answer. I really like the final shot, it's great."
2,well done but totally implausible,"That is it in a nutshell. More than acting, beautiful filming and style were required to make a better movie. I kept thinking how the movie could have been improved. But the sheer implausibility of every component of the movie right up to the last scene in which the final murders occured prevent this movie from coming together in a meaningful way.Consequently it is just a stream of events and characters not without interest but ultimately superficial."
2,Great acting but gore replaces suspense,"Of course it's begging for comparison with Strangers on a Train, given that both are based on a Patricia Highsmith novel and both involve a similar ""bring an innocent man into the realm of the killer"" scenario. But unlike Strangers, this film doesn't have much suspense. A big scene, in which the ""innocent"" man's wife learns more than we want her to know, is passed over way too quickly. This was basically the emotional climax of the film and it just zipped by. Hitchcock would have understood that it, not any shootout, was the film's big moment and would have lingered accordingly. However, Malcovitch and everyone else does a great job and Italy is beautiful. So if you can stand the gore, you may enjoy it as a rental, but it's no must-have."
1,I hated it!!!,I did not like this movie. I have seen better movies on television. It was senseless and the main actor John Malkovich was terrible. He was a disgusting lover as well. I hated it and I sold my copy as soon as possible.
4,An Excellent Thriller,"Well, given that I'm a big Malkovich fan, a big Highsmith fan and have savored the various Ripley screen adaptations with great zeal, I'd have to say that Cavani has hit a solid triple or maybe even a home run here. He and Malkovich achieve the perfect mood, the perfect ""je ne sais quoi"" that makes Highsmith's Ripley character so compelling. I'm a huge fan of the original Wim Wenders adaptation, ""The American Friend"" (ABSOLUTELY check it out) and I'd say that this film hits the bullseye in the same nuanced, stylish and malevolent way. If you're in the mood for a hi-end, sophisticated, european-flavored espionage-style suspense flick, here you go."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Ripley's Game is an intelligent thriller with a superb turn by Malkovich in the lead and capable support from the rest of the cast; a worthy addition to the handful of Ripley movies, it's a sadly-underappreciated film."
2,Berlitz Brevity Is Of Little Value,"In the last year I have traveled to Buenos Aires four times, as I have become enchanted by this wonderful city (not to mention the favorable exchange rate from which Americans have benefitted). In that time I have purchased some 15-20 books about Buenos Aires and Argentina, including travel guides, historical accounts, etc. Probably the least valuable is this Berlitz book on Buenos Aires. This book MIGHT be of negligible value if you were spending no more than 24 hours in this fascinating city, but I would recommend many others (especially Time Out Buenos Aires) before this Pocket Guide. This Berlitz quick study doesn't provide nearly the depth one needs to discover the fascinating, rich, tumultuous city that is Buenos Aires. Sorry, Berlitz!"
4,Charlie Walker: Real Country,"This is an overdue presentation of Charlie Walker's best work, first collected on his ""Best"" album. It gathers most of those songs and a few others that came along later. Not a whole lot is missing here.Fans might not know that Charlie started out very much like Willie Nelson, though perhaps earlier. Both began stellar careers as San Antonio deejays with too much talent to hide behind a turntable. Charlie is one of the rare artists not based on the West Coast who was able to get the great Ralph Mooney for steel on his classic ""Pick Me Up On Your Way Down."" Then just about everybody and his dog covered that one. This is the real deal."
1,Disappointing at best,"I recevived this video as a Christmas present. I am a knifemaker, and my sister got it for me, not realizing that this video is dedicated to nothing but stock removal. I thought I might watch it anyways for finish grinding tips. It would be a good video if you have a milling machine, a $1000 2 x 72 grinder setup, and thousands in other sorts of equipment. Not to mention the video is very grainy, and low quality, there are very few good closeups, and the explanations suck. Don't bother wasting your money...."
4,Near perfect funky vibe,"The only thing this cd was missing when it came out was the full-music version of However You Want Me. Other than that, near perfection!"
3,For those who bought the original tape in 1989,"I don't want anyone to misunderstand this but here it goes. I love this group's music since I first heard them. I want everyone to be aware that this is not the ""original"" album cut that was first released in 1988/89. In 1988 I purchased this tape which is ""great"", the way the music blended into the next track. In 2000, unfortunately that tape warped so I decided to buy the CD. The CD is not the same. The tracks are cut differently, but the music is still good.Enjoy."
3,The fist shot in an invasion that never really came,"A nice opening salvo in the Afro-Brit invasion; too bad that it never materialized as strongly as promised. Still, this CD manages to hit all of the high notes while, for the most part, avoiding too many cliches along the way. Some songs hold up much better than others over time - ""Back to Life"" and ""Fairplay"" are two good examples. Some songs were good for the time, but now ound dated - ""Dance"" and ""Jazzie's groove;"" others, like ""Feel Free"" are embarasments. The rest of the disc is okay, but I have serious issues with whoever decided to put ""Dance"" and ""African Dance"" - two versions of the same song- back to back with each other."
5,I can't live without Branston Pickle!,"Branston Pickle is basically the UK's version of our sweet relish. It's chunkier and brown, due to ground raisins and spices being in it. It is also called ""Ploughman's Pickle"" and is an integral part of a traditional ""ploughman's lunch."" That consisted of a thick slice of bread with a slab of cheddar and a thick slice of onion that farmers would wrap up to take with them in the field. When it was time to eat, they'd pull out a jar of Branston Pickle to top it with. There is nothing better IMHO than an open faced sandwich with Branston Pickle, aged cheddar and fresh tomato slices, broiled until bubbly. Yum!"
4,I think it's going to be good,"I read the sample on Kindle (which I highly recommend) and I liked it enough to download the whole thing. I like that he gets into how the publishing part works. He had me when he began talking about the six sisters of publishing. But, it probably is in bad need of an update because the book is 4 years old and none of this may still be true. So there's that.I did not like his thoughts on what to say to an agent who fails to get back to you after having your manuscript exclusively. He said to tell them you are moving on to another agent---err, not. He's maybe not looking at it from the writer's side. The LAST thing I want to do as a writer is alienate an agent. I think he should have given an e-mail sample of how he would approach the agent---maybe it would not be as harsh as it sounded. This made me read a little more carefully---in other words, I'm not taking his advice without questioning it with other writers to be sure."
2,Don't waste your money,"Most of these books are all the same regardless of the reputation of the author.This book could be subtitled...""or how to cure the common cold""... that's howinformative it is! If people writing these books were not already literary agents, what they have written would certainly not get them a literary agent."
3,It's ok...,"All this suggestions are good only on paper. In real life it doesn't works without real connections. So, it'a ok..."
1,"If bullet points a book doth make, then Pulitzer Prize is this one's fate.","Unless you're really into checklists, you'll not find this book very useful. It seems like the author is just using this book to promote his own literary agency. The only thing I learned from this book was that I should cross this guy off my checklist of potential literary agents."
1,Yawn,"This is just another in a long list of books written by authors, agents, publishers etc who hope to cash in on your struggle to get published and is no more help than all the others. Entertaining in some parts and self-congratulatory as are all the how-to guides for authors. You can get more of the same, equally useless and much cheaper by subscribing to one of the top two trade magazines for writers. Get better advice, more to the point, more up to date and free by participating in writers blogs."
3,One More of the Same!,"Like so many other books aimed at separating wanabe authors from a few of their dollars, this is more of the same. No better or worse. If you need a book, go for the cheapest. It will help you as much, and leave you with money for a dog and a beer."
5,How to get a literary agent,How to get a literary agent might be a good book. I'll let you know as soon as I get an agent.Lionel Nosenchuck
3,Cute but description is deceiving,"This is a very cute shoe organizer. But the fact that it is described as an ""over the door organizer"" is only accurate once the customer provides their own ""over the door"" hook. It should be more obvious that it doesn't come with a hook of any sort. Very disappointing!"
3,"My dog LOVES it, but ...","My dog loves it, she gets exited only from thinking she is going to get one. Her dentist is also happy with her teeth and it looks like this product delivers.So why only 3 stars ? I'm not sure this product is good for the dog health. I heard some rummers abouth dogs who had problems with it and I always susspected the way it looks. Just doesnt look like something that can be good for the dog.So what do I do ?Eventhough my dog is medium size I give her the small ones and only few times a week. I hope it will not affect her health in the long run.BTW, if u ask my dog to rate, she will probably give it 6 stars (or bones), it is her favorite."
3,Bought by mistake,"Unfortunately my dog only likes the beef flavor of this product. I accidentally purchased the green version. I did not see the beef version offered. Luckily, I have another dog that likes green just fine."
1,Awful...,"I purchased the Nylabone Nutri-Dent Edible Dental Chews for my 13-lb chihuahua mix this past weekend. Within a few hours of ingesting the treat, my dog began to have intense stomach issues and explosive diarrhea. It's now Day 3. Based on the reviews, it seems my dog falls into the 10-15% or so of dogs who experience this, so it's not by any means something that will happen to your dog if he or she eats these. But it just might."
1,Nutri Dent dog treats,"I recently have been purchacing the Nylabone product for my pooch ""Rainy'a 9 year old Peek...his favorite treat for the past 8yrs have been the green dental chews, he begs for them and devours eachone..the last two bags I recieved were not fresh , even the color was off , the entire pkg was hard and had no scent, usually when i open the bag the smell is evident...not so with the last two purchaces. The other problem is Rainy has no intrest any long in his favorite treat...therefore I will not be buying anymore, or is there any way to correct the situation..sincerely Peter J. Colangelo"
3,This map is too big!,These Michelin individual maps are really too big to be of much use unless you have a navigator who can fold it up on their lap. Michelin sells spiral bound volumes. If they have one for where you are going it's the best. This map would be OK for planning for travel by car. Not much help for train travel.
5,Thanks to Simon Green,"One word...Wulf Saxon. ""...Covered in blood, none of it his..."" I was drawn in to Greens world with masterful ease. The man can write. I have successfuly hooked all my friends on his books. Meeting Hawk and Fisher was a wonderful time. The wit and humor of Green struck my funny bone squarely and soundly. I wish and hope for more Hawk and Fisher adventures to come..."
1,I'm sorry if I offend any one,"I'm sorry if I offend any one, but I find Mr. Green's writing in this book to be very poor. I have read his first Deathstalker book and found it to be very enjoyable. This book however makes me wonder if he wrote it while still in high school. The charaters have no depth to them and they seem to be a continual attempt to look and act tough. I really did not care for this book."
5,Almost perfect.,"I love that this item is made in the US. I also love that the wheel is heavy duty and has a nice sharp edge. It looks like it will last a long time and slices through pizza nicely.The only thing that I don't absolutely love is the handle. It is lightweight and the brushed aluminum texture just doesn't feel really great in your hand. The lightweight handle also makes it feel a little cheap despite the quality of the wheel. After using this and some other utensils from the same company for a few days, I've gotten used to the feel and don't mind it so much now. I'm willing to deal with the handle because the cutting end of this is exactly what I wanted and I'm very happy to support US manufacturing."
2,very disappointed!,"I have some Rada knives and they are wonderful! The tomato knife is super sharp and glides through the tomato without problem. So when I was looking for a pizza cutter and I saw they made one, I figured it has to be good, right? No. I had made a thin-crust pizza, and this pizza cutter took 5 passes to get it to cut through. The edge of the wheel is extremely dull, despite it looking in the picture like it's got a knife edge on it. I returned it and will continue my quest to find a pizza cutter that actually cuts!"
3,Simply a basic cutter,I could but a much better quality pizza cutter at a local department store for the same price. I was dissapointed.
1,Floor Mats,"I was pleased when we first got them. BUT ater a week all the white that says ""WILD"" had started to come off. That is bad and it will not be able to see the words cause it wears off more every day. Would not recomend them to no one. My daughter birthday presant and after spending that money on the you would think that they would last more than a week. But the steering wheel is doing great, BUT i have ordered the seat covers back in the first of may and still to this day I have not got them. She ask me every day have they come in yet? NO they have not. I pray that they will last longer than a week with out peeling off too. So I just wanted to let you know the floor mats are bad and the seat covers have NOT got here yet. Thanks Belinda Gilmore"
5,Bedspread,I love it! Unbelievable how beautiful it is and the workmanship far passed my expectations.
5,Some of the most peaceful music I've ever heard,"This album flows from begining to end. I've owned ""Traveler"" for years and I still listen to it often. Rob Whitesides-Woo is a master of his art. His musical compositions are very clean. I recommend this album for meditation, after a hard day at work, or just Sunday morning staring off into space. You won't be sorry you bought it. -"
2,Queen Of Dullsville...,"Well, if your anything like me, this title gets your hopes up for an hour of babes running around the jungle in leopard-skin bikinis. Forget it! The first 40 minutes are spent showing us stock footage from India and Africa, peppered with scenes of some dull white folks wandering from place to place. When we finally meet the queen and her ""amazons"" (of which there are about 4), we get a village of gals who are about as feral as housecats! Yecch! ..."

5,Bed time music,"Like a reviewer above, I too purchased this tape at Natural Wonders, many years ago, and love it. I play it softly at night whenever I have insomnia, and my subconscious mind has long ago memorized the songs. The arrangements are so beautiful and melodic; and the styles vary from song to song, while at the same time blending into one another seamlessly to lull me to sleep. Very relaxing and nice! I've worried that my tape might break since its so old, so I'm going to buy the CD right now!"
4,Very restful,"Back of CD Jacket - ""Beauty of Love is a passionate album of heartfelt melodies which radiates both warmth and charm. Shardad blends the elegance of the acoustic piano with a tapestry of rich orchestral sounds.""This fully orchestrated CD is beautiful. If you listen to the first few tracks on Amazon, you have a pretty good idea what the rest is like. Nothing really stands out here as memorable, but the music has a very peaceful and relaxing quality to it.This CD when combined with a hot bubble bath, candles and a glass of wine are the perfect end to a very long pressure filled day."
3,Shardad Beauty of Love CD,I have an earlier version of meditation music by Shardad that is not published any longer by Serenity Music. It's my very favorite meditation music and I never get sick of it. I prefer listening to his other meditation CD and it is called Dream Images.
3,Nice picture and classy design ...,the tv looks great and is bright with good colors. what i am struggling with is the 15x9 ratio. i notice that everyone looks skinny/tall. don't know if this is my dvd player or this is somethign with all 15x9 models. It would have been nice to have black bars that stretched the screen out.Pros-The tv picture and color look great.-lots of inputs.-great speakers (detachable)Cons-The remote control kind of sucks. You have to push the buttons hard to do things.-Can not turn the back light off. (the tv is quite bright)-Limited number of aspect ratios.
2,Wish i had not bought this,"I bought this one for my 2.5 yr old kid. But the sounds coming out of this toy is hardly audible. moreover, it hardly has any resemblance to a real world laptop. there are no keys, instead this one has a soft pad on which you can press buttons (which are hidden under the towel). the screen is nothing but a few LEDs and is hardly impressive even to my kid. thinking of sending it back."
5,Reading's voice keeps the simple lessons easy,"Kate Reading narrates this classic account of discovering the healing power of apology. This outlines healing steps which may be taken to transform relationships, outlining common barriers to healing and how to overcome them. Reading's voice keeps the simple lessons easy."
5,Best Grand Canyon Video I've Seen,"I've ordered two or three videos of the Grand Canyon, looking for something that would capture the grandeur of this place - and all were disappointing. This one, however, does the trick. There's not much talking during the video, just wonderful music and extraordinary photography that lets the Grand Canyon speak for itself. I think I'll be able to watch this beautiful video time and time again. I can't imagine getting tired of it."
5,grand canyon serenade,wonderfully done dvd. music accompaniment enhances the visual experience of nicely crafted images. Highlihts many of the exceptional venues in the canyon. Felt like I was back there again.
5,Giovanni Hair Gel is a Great Product!,"I've been looking for a good alternative to the chemical hair gel nightmares out there for a long time. This is a GREAT product. It not only has an ingredient list that doesn't make a person cringe, it also works better than any other hair gel I've ever used. And I've tried a lot of brands over the years. I also appreciate that this product washes out completely and doesn't flake when dry.Wonderful!my full review is at:myreallifereviews dot com"
2,styling product,This is a very thin water like product. Doesn't hold well. Very runny. The same company makes a thick gel I prefer much better.

3,logic,This book is good in its explations but it does not contain enough. There are no answers to the excercises so you don't know if you are studying properly. The CD is just another book PDF. No interactive excersises that help or anything of the sort. Stay away from this book if you can!
4,Almost 5 Stars,"The book came to my door and packaging was crisp or whatever. Book was solid and I could tell it was new, but the covers were not parallel to each other and the binding was bent. I'm a stickler for small things. The fix was easy but if the book were available in a store near me, I would've purchased it there."
4,A very good book,This book has good mathematical approaches on Venn diagram and deductive arguments. It also contains many good problems.
2,Sometimes An Artist Doesn't Repeat Herself,"I found 'Feather on the Breath of God' to be a gem. So naturally I looked for more of Ms. Jacobsen's works. 'Hour of the Pearl' is not growing on me like 'Feather' did. I'm not sure what's missing but it doesn't have that ethereal feel to it as much.My recommendation is get 'Feather on the Breath of God,' take it to your next massage and get ready to just gooooo awaaaay. AAAAhhhhhhhhh......."
4,Jibaro Hasta Los Huesos,"I like it, bring back memories from my years in Puerto Rico, Can forget from where I come from and always will be part of Puerto Rico"
1,not what I expected,"The modem was delivered as ordered. The products from Hiro have negative reviews. This one did not, but it does not support cid. That is unclear from Hiro's description supplied on all websites. They recommended another product, which will support CID. That product on Amazon and other web sites does not say that it will support cid, so for these V92 products the only way you can know for sure is to try it. That is not right.I do not feel that I can ask Amazon for a refund because the problem is with HIRO, not with Amazon."
1,"Very good service ,very bad product","I purchased this product last Oct. 3 months it broke,customer service was very good ,sent me another one .6 months later it broke ,customer service was very good and sent me another one .2 months later it broke ,customer service sent me another one ,it never worked .I'm waiting on a new one as of this moment .Product is only warranted for one year so it looks like it over with this product when it breaks .Customer service was very good but the product was very bad .I would still do business with this company because of such good customer service ."
3,HIRO V.92 56K,"I never got a chance to use the product as it turned out, I bought the wrong item. I needed a USB, or external modem, but inadvertently purchased this one. I could not return it due to terms or return policy. I sold it on Craigslist.org and got most of my money back."
1,old technology,"I really don't have a need for this thing, but I got the phone line with the cable package so I thought what the heck, works for a while but Win7 64 didn't like it and kept getting BSofDeath so had to pull the board. You get what you pay for."
5,hard stuff,"This book has all the theory and practicall examples needed by professionals of queue management. I used to help me prioritize and streamline the work of an accounting department of GE.The formula explained here helped me define the optimal invoice amount to be processed with precedence, in order to maximize cash quarterly amount of the projects portfolio of the business unit.The results helped streamline the work of the accounting department, set up minimum employees needed, and get precie quarterly cash forecasts.It was something unexpected and a great result.And i used just the basics of what explained in this book."
5,We liked it very much,We have been trying to get the CD of Rain Dance and we are having a hard time getting it. It is a relaxing CD and we enjoyed it very much.
3,Don Fardon - 'Belfast Boy' (Prestige),"I usually don't even bother with CD singles, but I happened to have access to this three track CD single. Has the 'original' version of Don Fardon's song ""Belfast Boy"", then a updated version of the tune done in 2006 and his better-known song, his cover of Paul Revere & The Raiders smash hit ""Indian Reservation"". Pretty much aimed toward the completists and die-hards."
5,Sinful Simplicity,"Bruce's Bakery Cookbook made me wish I'd visited the famous New York Eatery so I could try all the wonderful treats out. Bruce takes some of his famous tastes and reveals the recipes, which are overall not too complicated at all. Including cakes, cookies, bars, brownies, pies, frostings, a wonderfully simple Chocolate Ganache recipe, and more. The Only thing that's missing is pictures of the recipes, or better yet, samples of each of them in little ziplocks."
2,"Overwhelming Smell is Too Strong, Even for Adults","I really wanted to like this product because it uses all natural ingredients and the packaging is cute. However, my two-year-old son hates it. The few times we tried it, he either cried or became irritated and wanted to get out of the bath, the exact opposite effect we were looking for. The point is to encourage a child to want to take a bath, right? The smell--a combination of citrus and other ingredients--is also very strong. In fact, I think there is so much citrus (acidity?) that it stinging our son's eyes and maybe even his skin. There are little or no bubbles, which is also no fun. Even we (the parents) think it's too powerful, and we only used one capful (the directions say you can use up to two). If even we wouldn't use it in a bath, that's when I know it's not right. Finally, it's expensive. I like supporting unique, environmentally friendly products, but we will not but this again."
1,disappointed in product,"I have been extremely frustrated by this product. While it apparently works well when it does work, although it removes email attachments that it thinks might be dicey without asking you, after 2 months of use it started giving me ""low protection"" warnings. Apparently it is conflicting with something on my system, but the Panda techies have been unable to help--and this has been going on for six weeks! I have spent hours trying to resolve the problem, so I wouldn't recommend it to others."
5,Very Comfortable,"I'd rate these higher if I could. This thong is superb! I had always hated thongs but these are so soft, stretchy and nicely cut, that I've changed my mind. They're tons more comfortable than any brief, boxer (obviously) or other thong I've tried. The microfiber fabric is incredible. Forget about cotton, this is by far the best material for your underwear. It feels light, breathable and best of all, it doesn't squash or flatten you like cotton always does. They machine wash too and don't wear out. I've had mine for months and they're still in great condition. They're amazing! I had to go back and order more: one for each day of the week (more colors please!). They make you feel sexy and comfy at the same time. Absolutely essential underwear!"
3,Sizes run small,"The JM Skinz Thongs are well made, the material feels good to the skin, but the sizes run small. I inquired of the seller as to what size to buy as I wear thongs around the hips, not the waist as their size chart indicated. Around the hips, I am size 38 1/2"". I was advised to purchase the Extra Large, which I did. They are a little tight. Otherwise, they are a fine product. I won't buy more of them since I can't get the fit that I want."
5,Great product,"This product is great. I am a first time buyer of thongs, but this product is by far the best one I have purchased. It is very comfortable and breathable and it has a good pouch. I would recommend this product."
5,Comfortable Thong!,"The reviews about this thong are ""spot on"". It has all the qualities I was looking for: comfort, style, and quality. Excellent cut and choice of fabric. And like some of the other reviewers say, the back is just right to avoid feeling uncomfortable for all day wear. It provides a level of support not found in other conventional styles, yet is not too constricting."
4,Pretty tasty dark chocolate,"I like dark chocolate and this is pretty tasty. I like the ingredients, that it is organic, and that it is made in Switzerland. I give it 4 out of 5 stars for taste and overall."
3,There's better...,"I was really excited to try this brand as I've heard good things about it. I appreciate that all of the ingredients are organic however the overall taste of the product (to me) isn't that great. The chocolate ""flavor"" itself reminds me of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup that you'd put on ice cream.The ""Endangered Species Otter, Smooth Milk Chocolate (48%)"" tastes more dark than this, and much more ""chocolaty""."
1,a stinker,"This is the first time I have put down a book without finishing it. Puerile dialogue. If I had read once more about Paula saying something ""merrily"" I would have thrown up. Very jolly hockey stockings early 50s British kids books' dialogue. How the hell did Marler have all those contacts with arms dealers (presumably illegal)and yet Alvarez could provide licences immediately Marler returned to the hotel? Come on Colin! Until I stumbled briefly onto this I thought that The Devil's Teardrop was the worst book I had ever read and I finished that one. Apologies to Jeffrey Deaver but Colin Forbes' effort leaves yours for dead."
1,Never again,My second attempt at a Colin Forbes novel. I must put it down midway through the book. Unbelievable characters and childish narrative. A thriller? I think not.
2,Better luck next time Colin,This book made me disappointed... I'm gonna give Colin a second chance however. Poor research and a naive language i think. Perhaps he had a bad day(s).
2,"Good plot, weak delivery","Although I have enjoyed reading Colin Forbes' books in the past, this one was fairly weak. The plot was good - the usual meglomanic trying to take over the world vs. Tweed, Paula, Marler etc... However the full impact was let down in the delivery. Real people don't say ""pass a message to X, who is in the room next to mine"" if they are in that room anyway. There were several moments where things happened too easily too - where does Marler buy all those guns in every city in the world? Alot of the story became very easy to guess although there were a few occasions where I didn't expect the next turn. All in all, a good transatlantic plane journey book, but not a classic."
4,A keeper for your cookbook shelf if you are NOT vegetarian,"This book is a comprehensive resource that tells you how to select, store, and prep your vegetables. So just to demystify your farmers market, this book is an essential. However, in terms of recipes, it does fall short, treating vegetables only as soups or sides for the most part. Also if you *are* vegetarian, many recipes call for anchovies, bacon, chicken stock etc. If I had to pick between this and Deborah Madison's ""Local Flavors: Cooking and Eating from America's Farmers' Markets"" I would pick the latter since that offers more main dish recipes, and covers all farm market produce, fruits, vegetables, and non-vegetarian stuff too, while keeping recipes involving vegetables vegetarian. And Deborah Madison also instructs you on how to prepare more exotic veg.Despite the cons it is a fascinating read, and its nice that it does not assume you are already a ""cook"""
4,A Bonus for the Home Gardener,"The title -""Vegetables""- says it all. This book is a wonderful choice to learn how to store, select and prepare individual vegetables in a variety of recipes which enhance that vegetable. Beautifully illustrated, it is organized alphabetically by vegetable. If you looking for more complete meals or information about vegetarian eating you will be disappointed -- the recipes are best used as side dishes for seasonal produce. For the money, I recommend Deborah Madison's ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone"", I use it all the time, and I'm not a strict vegetarian."
5,farmers market confidence!,"Do you find yourself gazing at kale while filling your basket with broccoli and carrots? Then this is the book for you! Be bold in a farmers market, buy the kale or any other unfamiliar vegetable and cook it with confidence! This book tells you all about a vegetable, when it is in season, what to do with it in general and in various stages of ""ripeness"" and gives you recipies to try it in. A wonderful cooking encyclopedia of vegetables."
4,Green applaudes,"This book is not only wonderful, it is also very useful. Just have a look at the index, and you want to rush to the closest grocer to get some fresh seasonal vegetables. Not the easiest recipes ever, but good guidelines. I myself make most of these recipes as main courses - that's sophisticated enough."
2,Not my favorite,"In my first go-over of a cookbook, I look for the inspiring recipes. Well, I found none here. The incredible amount of space given to discussing the vegetables themselves is a waste. I have other sources for that information. And, the lack of pictures or drawings of the completed dishes is a serious omission. I love Alice Waters and what she has done for American cuisine, but save your money."
2,Kind of plain cards,"These arrived timely and in perfect condition. Nice packaging. Cards on on the plain side, not as pretty as I expected."
5,Great Value For The Money,"Succinct, informative, and well-written, The Neatest Little Guide To Making Money Online is a great value. Admittedly, I am a novice at making money online, but in my opinion this book is a great starting place. Jason Kelly loads this book with well-researched resources for all aspects of successful website development, almost always suggesting reliable FREE alternatives to the pay-for-service resources on the net. It is fun and easy to read, and it contains no filler. Recommended."
1,Not Worth the Price,"On Amazon this book will set you back nearly 15 dollars (that includes shipping and handling). And what do you get for that 15 dollars? Not a whole lot. I knew I was in trouble with this book when I noticed in the table of contents that there was an entire chapter devoted to ""How to Buy a Computer"". Maybe the author should've gone all the way back to ""Ways to make money to Buy your own Computer"". To be fair, the book does offer specific links regarding web page design and affiliates, but you can get that by going to Yahoo, for free. Save your 15 bucks."
2,"Ok, But Hardly Comprehensive","I read this book and tried to use several of his techniques on my website to increase revenue. I found that much of the information in the book was hardly innovative or ground-breaking.Jason Kelly gave a very general view of things on the internet. I do agree that it is difficult to keep up with a changing medium such as the internet by writing a book, but I have read several other books that are far more insightful and detailed.This book is rather entertaining, but if you're looking for a book to really be your guide through making money online, look elsewhere. The money paid for the book is not worth the value."
3,Skate's Take,"Huh huh! Play Doh! Ah ha ha ha ha! No, but seriously, this was a very well written tale. I especially enjoyed the details surrounding the controversy about Socrates' teachings. I reccomend this book to anyone who has a laptop and is planning to sit on the john all day. And if you don't have a laptop,TRY METAMUCIL - never fails! Well, I'm SKATE, and that's my TAKE!"
5,"great, but","This is a great book, it took me 37 years to try to deal with PTSD and if I had worked it with another vet or a professional it might have been less painful."
5,Beautiful cat's-eye view of life at night,"I read this book over and over to my two year-old, and every time I read it I loved it more. Ashley Wolff has taken an otherwise ordinary night in a rural home and turned it into a wonderful look at life from the point of view of a (nocturnal) cat. Beautifully illustrated and perfectly told, this is my current favorite children's story. Our copy is worn out and has pages torn from use - I can't believe it's out of print!"
4,Sweet and wonderfully illustrated,"The illustrations make this book as the text is very simple and quite repetitive- the humans are busy with the family, but the cat pays attention. The cat watches a rain storm, a hunting owl, the roosters, the nighttime= all the wonderful things that cats notice. Finally, in the morning the cat falls asleep and the little girl starts noticing things the other family members miss.There is an older girl- maybe 6, and a baby boy so this would be a great story for someone who has a new baby sibling. My favorite human scene is when the mom gets up during the night to feed the baby brother and has a look of peace and contentment- every mother's favorite part of baby nights. I would have given the book 5 stars if the baby got to snuggle in bed with his mom- it would have seemed just a bit more real. I still recommend the book highly."
1,Buyer beware!!!!!!!,I have had nothing but trouble with this order. And I still have not received the order. Sold thru Amazon? Can;t get in contact with them to find out why. Beward of buying anything thru Amazon sold by others.
5,Fall in LOVE with Dance,"This is one of the most comprehensive videos about swing dancing, that I have ever seen. Each pattern is taught slowly enough to let it ""sink in"". The pattern is repeated from different angles, (both the male and the female parts) and the camera focuses on the footwork. When the lessons have been taught, there are little blurbs about clubs, clothing, and some general dancing. Overall, I really enjoyed this video"
3,Newbie Friendly,An upbeat mixture of entertainment and instruction. After a few viewings I will pass this one along. It would be great to know the name of the swing line dance that is the last performance!
2,Inconsistent quality,The first case I bought of these was pretty decent for the money. So I decided to buy more. The second pack of 10 was awful. They smelled awful and the olive oil was the same color as used motor oil. I threw them out and Amazon was kind enough to refund our money. I think I will go back to crown prince.
2,RIPOFF,"The sardines are extremely tasty, and absolutely free of skin and bones. Definitely superior. Five-star contents.BUT - there were exactly 4 sardines rolling about in a 4.375oz tin, yielding a superpremium price, amounting to $0.50 PER SARDINE. The tin could easily have contained 7 or 8 fish of this size. No argument here, save for having been led to believe that this was at least 4oz of fish (had they been packed traditionally), not 50% oil (as packed in this instance.) Negative 3 star practices. Net 2 stars.There was no claim as to quantity or weight of fish - no false claims in the advertising verbiage. This is simply ""sharp"" practice - a ""gotcha"", for which the company deserves to lose its patronage. (There is no online Reese resource for complaint, comment, or feedback, adding insult to injury.) Caveat emptor."
4,Good sardines (but not for me),These are good tasting sardines and the price is also good. Nothing really stands out about them.I will not buy these again because I actually like the bones and skin!
3,Doesn't quite reach what I feel it's goal was,"Well, the begining comes off as a wannabe A Clock Work Orange and just doesn't come off quite as shocking or brutal as Clock Work did. Eventually you understand that this is a very personal story and pretty much soley focuses on the main character who does a great job at acting. However, the over all film did not leave me begging for more or even a second watch. It attempts to be brutal yet the content is honestly far from it. If your going into this film with the hopes of endless bar brawls and sheer mayhem on the streets then I'd look else where or just watch A Clock Work Orange again. I just feel the film did not reach it's full potential. If you want an emotional and personal story about one mans journey to become ""a better person"" then have at it.E"
4,"Disturbing, yet gripping","I'm Scottish, therefore I drink. The first time I saw this film I found it disturbing, yet gripping. The second time you notice the Ska (Reggae like) soundtrack even more. Excellent acting and a theme that you can lift your mug to."
1,Biased,"Overall, don't care for her American ""Heritage"" series (although I ended up reading quite a few.) I'll just give the description from the back cover:LUDWIG, the patriarch. A proud man, he fled a Germany ruled by privilege and built a life of undreamed-of wealth . . . COLIN, the restless son. The lure of the untamed land drew him from the wealthy haunts of New York - into the warm embrace of an Indian maiden . . . MINNA, the beloved daughter. She defied her family for love of the lusty son of her father's fiercest rival . . . The MacCamerons of Canada. They were bound to the dynasty by love - and blood. Together they would battle a wilderness of hostile tribes until the fur trade was theirs - and limitless wealth and passion became . . . The Gunther Heritage."
4,Well done and very enjoyable,"I'm not a reader of romance novels and hardly a history buff, yet this book was delightful. A very well told story with well developed and interesting characters."
5,Wonderful!,"Elizabeth Chadwick's ability to create both believable characters and believable medieval settings is nothing short of amazing. Shadows and Strongholds is a romance, but it's far superior to most category romances, and really, it's superior to most historical novels in general. I can hardly wait for Chadwick's next book."
5,"Add boat and water, and you are sailing!","This little book contains all you need to know to get started on your life long enjoyment of sport sailing.After reading this, I got the use of a friend's boat (a 22 foot day sailor), and after 20 minutes of 'let's see if you can handle her', I was solo sailing for the rest of the summer.Great fun.I also recommend coast guard approved sailing lessons, even for inshore sailing, but this book does a great job of getting you started."
2,Emperor's New Clothes?,"I've been a senior manager for many years now, and I always find it interesting to read the latest load of so-called 'business improvment' books when they are printed. Unfortunately, this is yet another book to add to the recycle pile.It fundamentally fails to grasp any of the points that it attempts to make, and manages to use just about every management cliche ever devised, including some that were even new on me! Personally, I find books such as this similar to the story of the Emperor's New Clothes: It may well be the flavor of the month, but in time, people will see it to be totally transparent.However, if you want to try to master the art of using thousands of words to say nothing, then maybe this book is for you after all!"
4,Good Questions But Be Careful,"Overall Finz was a good *secondary* source for me as I studied for the CA Bar. However, that said, the book is somewhat dated( 2004). You will find that some of the questions use older legal terminology, and a few explanations are in direct conflict with Barbri's 2007/2008 outlines. In some instances the law has slightly changed, so be sure to use this book primarily as a secondary source so you can identify these subtleties. For example, Joint tenancy w/ the right of survivorship is never spelled out like you will find in most MBEs today, but rather Finz simply refers to them as joint tenancies. And this is just one example. In addition, I found several errors throughout the book and a few clearly wrong explanations, but if you know the law beforehand then this should only be a slight annoyance. Finally, the answer choices are a bit easier to eliminate than what I found on the Bar. And some questions tend to strech the law and facts a bit too thin."
5,great preparation,"As the others here said, this book is great preparation for the MBE part of the bar exam, yet, I felt that the actual exam questions tended to be a tad more difficult than the ones in the book (the four answer-choices seemed to be even more similar to each other than in the book). Still, I mainly used the book to prepare and had a score of 90% in the exam."
2,Out of date!,"The MBE is not an easy exam! The NCBE changes the style and format of the exam on a regular basis. On all of the more recent exams, there are not multiple questions based on the same fact pattern, nor are there questions with Roman Numerals. Additionally, the questions on the book seem to be on the short side. Overall, this book is not representative of the current MBE format."
1,"This book is a good source while in law school, however, DO NOT rely on it for Bar preparation.","I used this book to prepare for July 2011 California Bar. BIG mistake, although the questions and answers are very good, I felt that they are too easy in comparison to the MBEs on the Bar itself. Bar applicants recommended for me to use BarBri or PMBR. God Bless and Good Luck."
1,"No method, confusing waste of time, zero stars","No real method here. The make believe method is: read the question part first, read the fact pattern, then put an 'f' by every wrong answer, the one left is the right answer. Not much of a method. The questions are worthless as a learning aid, arbitrary answers based on how you interpret a word, like ""extreme and outrageous"" or ""reasonable"" or ""unique item"". He pulls out obscure UCC sections that are never tested. His answers recite the basic law, but never divulge why the right ahswer is actually right. No explaination of the wrong answers, only a terse ""B, C & D are wrong because A is right"" The Barbri and Kaplan strategies, like exclamation point is an excited utterance, will get you the wrong answer here in Fitz every time. A confusing, frustrating, and over-priced waste of time."
5,A very good source of practice questions for the multistate. Although many of the questions vary from the usual query format.,"This study source should only be used to supplement the study of mulitstate subjects. The query format often deviates from those used in the actual test, but nevertheless the exercise helps to reinforce knowledge of the topics."
4,Thank you so much,"This book helped me out so much when I was studying for my finals earlier this year. I'm also using it for the upcoming FYLSE, and it is helping me out, and if it helps me half as much for the FYLSE that it did when I needed some extra help during studying for my finals, then I'm gonna be in good shape.I would suggest this for anyone who is a 1st year student in California, it will help you then and further on."
1,Strategies & Tactics for the finz Multi State Method,"I have never received this book since I ordered it on 9/4. Have contacted seller, but no response. So irresponsible!"
5,3rd one's a charm!,Deep forest continues to deliver even after 2 albums...I may like this more than the other 2 combined.
3,Disappointing,"The stories are potentially good, but it's very difficult to understand a lot of what goes on. Jerico seems to be only half in charge of the case, and shouts a lot."
4,They've come a long way..,"I'm from the Rochester area and purchased the Chesterfield Kings's first album back when I was in high school (early 80's). It was a cool album and cool to see a bunch of covers done so well by a bunch of local guys (You could see Greg and Andy working in the local record store House of Guitars. In fact, you still can!). I bought their second album also, but didn't think too much of it. They were trying their hand at writing their own songs, with mixed results.I hadn't purchased anything by the band in 20 years but did recently when I was in a local cd store browsing. This cd is incredible. They've become great songwriters in the years since I listened to them last. If you like early Stones' singles, like Jumpin' Jack Flash, I think you'll like this stuff. This stuff sounds kind of trippy at times, but maintains that kind of snotty-punk vibe of the early Stones. Very good."
4,tight Re-Mix,"Gone Till November is a good song,but the Re-Mix blows the Original Away.R.kelly is on the Hook for the Re-Mix&He knocks it out of the Park as does John Forte.this is tight.this is back when Wyclef was happening."
2,Only One Good Song,"I don't know what the other reviewers were listening to. The beats behind both the ""Makin Runs"" remix and ""No Airplay"" are awful, the latter sounding like the ringing of a cowbell. The only redeeming quality of the cd is the original ""gone til november."" Four of the five songs on here are intolerable. The production is beyond awful. I do not recommend this cd to anyone. I would definitely recommend the original song, for download, but the cd is no good."
2,Canary Island Confusion,"I am so glad I returned the copy of this book before we left for the Canary Islands. We are seasoned travelers and this is one of the worst travel guides ever. The information is disjointed and incomplete, the text is user unfriendly, and the cross-references are pointless. Lonely Planet usually has excellent resources. This isn't one of them."
4,Not A Dull Moment,"Michel'le was hot back in the day and this CD is very good. She came out with a 2nd album sometime in the mid-1990s, but she didn't get much exposure. To this day I wonder if her Minnie Mouse talk was just a gimmick or if that *really* was the way she sounded."
5,Amazing Voice&#65533; Amazing Songs,"Michel'le has a deep, soulful singing voice that really adds effect to her pop/R&B songs. This album is jam-packed with amazing grooves and upbeat dance tracks that contain just as much style as they do substance. The best track here is ""No More Lies"" which hit #1 in early 1990, I believe."
3,Thank God she didn't choose acting instead,"It's fortunate that this chick can sing as well as she does, because hearing her actually speak makes you want to really plug up your ears tight. Her biggest hits were the uptempo jams ""No More Lies"" and ""Nicety"" but she's at her best on slow ballads like ""Something In My Heart"" and ""Close To Me""."
5,Blast from the Past,I absolutley LOVE LOVE LOVE this CD.... I used to have it years ago- only it was a cassette tape- go figure! Although this music is 15+ years old- it is still really good and Michel'le sounds fabulous- as long as she is singing and NOT TALKING.
3,Worth The Money,"Michel'le may talk like a little girl, but when she sings she is all woman! Her voice is strong and sexy. From the first track to the last, Michel'le is worth the money.Michel'le"
1,Lousy,"Over 50% of the holes weren't big enough for the dowels to fit...I returned it. Additionally, very cheap and flimsy. It's not worth having even if it were free."
1,Cheap,This product is so cheap we couldn't even get it put together without breaking. I don't think it would hold many cklothes without colapsing. The would is so cheap I wouldn't even use them to start fires you might get burned.
1,Disappointed,This was a waste of money. Comes in pieces to assemble. The pieces don't fit together and the wood is so cheap it broke as I was putting it together. It went from the shipping box to the garbage can! I don NOT recommend this product at all.
2,my new clothes dryer,"This wooden clothes drying rack was pretty inexpensive and now that I have it I know why! It's very flimsy and rickety compared to the old fashioned ones I remember. I'm sure it will work for what it was intended, but I'm not sure how long it will last."
4,Cheap and good for light uses,"This dryer rack is practically cheap and serves well for its use. If you keep in mind that this is a fragile construction of thin woods and becareful not to put a heavy weight on it, it will be effective.Lay only wet clothes on it and do not concentrate the weight on a particular area. On the other side, thanks to its light construction, it is very light and easy to handle. It can be folded in usual times for your convenience."
2,Flimsy thing!,"Really flimsy wood, i had broken it before finishing putting it up. Saying that, it has been in use everyday for a few months now and it is still standing, just on a wonk and held with superglue!"
1,&%$#*!,"What an absolute piece of &%$#*! It broke in two places during assembly. After replacing a rod and gluing braces on a cross piece, I got it to stand! When we actually hung something on it, it broke another cross piece. It might be useful for kindling, but remove the plastic connectors first!I hope you're reading this before you buy one, and not afterward like me..."
1,Tiiiimmmmber!!!!,This was the worst money I've ever spent! A strong sneeze could have knocked this drying rack over it didn't holdmore than two wet tshirts with out tipping over and one of the wooden slats used for draping the wet clothes over wasn't long enough to snap into place. I ended up using it for kindling in a fire this product had the worst design ever and I ended up buying a metal rack from target for almost half the price that works great and doesn't tip..... Dont ever buy this drying wrack unless your trying to throw good money away!
1,Broke in 60 seconds,"The product arrived and I assembled it as shown in the directions. Went to stand it up and one of the hinges moved to much, so I laid it back down to tighten it and the wood snapped in half. Cheap production! I had an exact one of these previously (which is why I bought another) that was made with a much sturdier wood."
1,TERRIBLE,"THIS ITEM WAS SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND BUYING. IT WAS TERRIBLE. AND THEN I HAD TO SEND IT BACK, WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
1,Whitney Design 05111RTA Folding Wood Clothes Dryer,This is the worst item I have EVER purchased on-line. This item should be removed from your product line. It is a piece of junk. The directions were impossible to follow. The dryer broke before we could use it. It is too fragile for use and is impossible to put together. We used it for firewood. Please remove this dryer from your product line. It has too many bad reviews from too many people....I suggest that people spend the extra ten dollars and purchase the metal dryer. It is a much better product.
1,Useless!! Very Bad Design and Quality,"I think this was the first time when I forgot to check the reviews for an item and just went ahead and ordered it. I would have to say this item is poorly designed and way too fragile to work for the intended use. The rods did not even fit. No matter what I did, I still had 3 rods that were too short. Even the ones that fit were popping out of their socket at the slightest touch."
1,Total Garbage,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a complete waste of time to assemble. It is NOT free-standing. The minute I put a damp sock on it, it fell over. This defective piece of junk was returned to Amazon the day I received it."
1,flimsy and not worth the time it takes to assemble,If you really need a dryer of this type this is not the one for you. It is a piece of junk. I'm surprised that is being sold on amazon. As inexpensive as it is it is stll not worth the price. I only gave it one star because you wouldn't accept no stars.
1,Lasted 2 uses!,I used this item twice-the second time I had one sweatshirt and one sweater on the rack & it broke into 5 pieces! Waste of money.
1,not pleased with the performance,"Hello, delivery was prompt but the product is poor quality. The dowls do not fit into the support frame so the whole thing falls apart. i would appreciate a refund."
4,Good for what it is,"It works well, and it's good for the price. Not too stable and sturdy, but it gets the job done just fine."
1,Inferior product,"This product is far inferior to any wooden clothes dryer I have had in the past. It takes only 2 minutes to set up, but doesn't stay together and falls over constantly. Not worth even half the price."
1,Broke during assembly,This thing is so flimsy and poorly made it cracked inserting one of the rods. Enough said.
1,This Product Sucks!,It broke under my first wash load! It sucks! I bought a better dryer. It cost 4x as much but it is worth paying the extra money to have a product that will last!
1,Ridiculous,"I assembled this thing in about 30 minutes when it shouldn't have taken more than 10. Some of the rods refused to be inserted into the appropriate slots. Once assembled, the contraption wobbled and collapsed, with absolutely nothing hanging on it. I came to the conclusion that this is a piece of junk, and threw it in the fireplace."
3,Useful for light laundry,"This drying rack is pretty good. But it is a little bit weak for the heavy clothes.It is useful for just only light laudry such as training outfits, underwears, and towels."
1,Don't buy it!,"Whitney Design 05111 RTA Folding Wood Clothes DryerI am very disappointed in the product. While following the directions and putting the dryer together the top peice that holds it together broke. I had to super-glue it back together. I guess you ""get what you pay for""."
3,Good clothes drying rack,"Easy to assemble with color-coded bars. Snaps together quickly. Easy to fold down or set up. Slightly wobbly when set up because it is so light weight, but settles down with a few wet things on it. Less expensive than others I found on net."
1,don't buy this item,"This product is poorly crafted, overpriced, and unsteady. Not all components are made of wood and it looks tacky. Don't buy this item."
1,Complete junk!,"This is easily the worst clothes dryer I've ever seen. It looks like they took the cheap wood used to make wooden pallets and cut them into the shape they wanted. The plastic used for the fasteners is the cheapest feeling floppy stuff imaginable, and is held onto the dowels by a single metal staple. One dowel came out of the box with the cross section shape of a D instead of round. It fell out repeatedly. One of the top dowels just broke after a handful of uses--plastic sheered off from inside the fastener.Line up ten dollar bills, and burn them underneath your clothes. It will last longer and dry your clothes faster."
2,there's a reason why it's $13,"cheap, unsturdy, flimsy, but it works. luckily everything fit well and nothing was broken. easy to assemble. i don't expect it to last. this is just a hold over until i find one that i like."
1,Wooden clothes rack,This is a very cheaply made wooden clothes rack. I was afraid to put to many clothes on it as I thougth it would break. I do not recomend anyone to buy this product unless you live a lone and have just few things to hang on it.
1,junk!,"total piece of junk! Assembly is easy in concept, but difficult to actually do, because the construction and workmanship is so utterly poor. I bought this thing and one of the wood legs was nearly rotted through, but i figured i'd rather just wrap some tape around the stupid thing to keep it working. But after one use of holding actual clothes, that bum leg broke all the way through. So i called amazon for a replacement, which they sent no problem. But they made me return the old one.. which was a huge pain, because clearly it is not designed to ever be disassembled. Several of the legs broke when i tried to unplug the rods, and it all barely fit back in the box. And of course i had to take it to the post office myself too. So all this effort and headache for a lousy $10? Forget it.. get a better one from BBB for $20."
1,"Horrible Product, not worth the 10 dollars...","This thing is horrible. It does not work correctly. It is instable, some of the dowells were the wrong size when I got it, it falls over. Horrible, horrible product. DO NOT BUY. Spend the extra 10 bucks and get a nice one."
1,"Bad Instructions, Flimsy Quality - I Won't Buy Again","Where do I begin? The instructions were in shreds, due to having been stapled to the plastic bag containing the rods. The instructions were unclear as to assembly. The rods didn't fit well into the rack sides. This was a cheap item with regards to price, so I didn't expect very much - but I got even less than I expected. I don't think I'll be buying anything by this manufacturer again."
1,Piece of crap,What a piece of crap. Just putting this together broke it. And was missing one of the snap parts. Truely a waste of money.
3,"Fragile, but will work well for a handy man","This is a very light and fragile construction assembled from wooden dowels laminated with plastic and thin wooden planks. A few years ago I purchased a previous model from a hardware store; eventually one of the planks broke near its end that held the structure assembled, So I have been looking for a replacement since and bought a couple of these now.I don't remember having any problems assembling the older version, but this one was harder. The problem is the instruction sheet is not clear about how to align the wooden frames before assembly. Also, some dowels do not fit in easily. If you inserted a dowel incorrectly, chances are that a plastic end will come off when you pool the dowel out.If you have some simple tools and 20 minutes of time, you can fix all its problems and have a very light foldable drying rack that has no better alternatives at Lowes, Home Depot, and some other chains that I personally visited when looking for a drying rack."
1,Too many typos,I couldn't make it past the first few pages. There are numerous typos in the Kindle version. This is especially annoying since I mostly use the Text-to-Speech.
4,Wolverine versus the Marvel Universe,"This is an exceptionally enjoyable Wolverine tale while at the same time being one of the more ridiculous. The HAND, ninja organization and HYDRA are up to no good and end up contributing hundreds of cannon fodder for the threshing engine of Logan and his allies. There are some interesting confrontations while Wolverine is under the control of Darkness and it is nice to see his inner dialogue flower beyond the usual ""I'm the best there is at what I do,"" cliches. Anyway, it's silly and stupid in all the right ways and thankfully no appearance by Sabretooth so if you like Wolverine in ninja action, you'll have a good time with this book."
5,Wolverine fights the biggest fights!!!!!!!!!!,"In this book begins with wolverine transformed by H.I.D.R.A in a zombie/deadly-killer, and their mission is to kill all the heroes (Elektra, Ddaredevil, The avengers, etc.) and nothing seems to stop him. The art of John Romita Jr. is just perfect a very large compendium of shoking images. and the story telling is excellent too. This book it's a ""must have""."
2,Why ruin a great run?,"The story collections that proceeded this rather mundane and ordinary book were so much better. The Brotherhood, Coyote Crossing and The Return of the Native by Greg Rucka were great stories and really got to the heart of what this character is all about. Then Millar comes along with this story and wrecks that great streak. It does not even really deliver on the promise of Wolverine vs. the Marvel universe. Millar uses all the run of the mill and tired methods of avoiding real confrontation. This was tremendously disappointing after my hopes had been raised so high by previous volumes in this Wolverine run. Enemy of the State delivers nothing new and actually hurts the deveopment of this character. This version of Wolverine is flat and the story is weak and lacks any and all oomph. The art is good, but beyond that it has very little going for it."
3,It was okay,"What I mean by it being only okay, is it is nothing great. Before the story it has this preface where a guy talks about how he doesn't like comic books, with the exception of The Watchmen and similar deep original thought provoking ones- He then explains that he found this book to be one of them, surprisingly. Therefore when I started reading I was ready for, you know, a story! There was none, it's precisely a regular comic book. The consistent use of the word ""dude"" by grown men is a good hint in that direction. The story does not go anywhere. However it is still pretty good, as far as wolverine seriously messes a lot of people up. Luckily it is not one of those where he just knocks people out with his claws somehow; he kills A LOT of people. I would still recommend it, but not the story, just for the action."
2,MISREPRESENTED AS ITS NOT 20-32 ITS 20-25!,I AM UPSET AS THIS WAS LISTED AT A RE-RELEASE IN 08 WITH A COMPILATION OF ISSUES 20-32..THAT IS FALSE IS THE SAME AS THE 06 AND JUST 20-25!!!I COULDVE PAID 1/2 IF AMAZON WAS HONEST
2,It's okay,"Not really a lot of ""scrap"" involved here, I ended up buying fabric for one or two projects just so I could try them! It's a pretty book, well written, but I didn't find it as useful as I thought I would. Mary Mulari's books are better, IMHO."
4,Very sturdy product,"I got this for my 4 year old's closet so we could organize her clothes for the week. Every week, her school has a color day where she needs to wear something specific and this is a great reminder and help for me since she or we have never forgotten! It is very sturdy and not at all flimsy. It does take up quite a bit of space on the right side of her closet so my only advice would be to make sure you check the dimensions since this is quite wide. I love it and will continue to use it."
5,Excellent Commentary for the serious Bible student.,"Pink is one of the best expositors in Christendom. If you are a serious student that has an appetite for an advanced, detailed writing style look no further!The only problem is Amazon only has volume 1. Volume 1 only covers chapters 1 & 2. When are we going to get the rest the of 1 John commentary!?"
4,A Thoughty Picture Book,"Jenny Curtis' ""Grace Kelly: A Life in Pictures"" is a must for Grace fans. Lovely reproductions of some of Kelly's most enchanting photos fill the book. It is a pleasant addition to any collection, and it is exactly what it is entitled, a life in pictures...nothing more and yet, nothing less."
5,Very good picture book of her life,I thought this was a wonderful detailed account of a beautiful actress' life for a Grace Kelly fan. This book was well put together and I love to just flip through it over and over because I get something new out of it everytime.
2,nice book-bad condition,"The order was shipped very quickly which was great. However, the condition of the cover jacket was not as described. If I knew the book was in this condition I would have never bought it. It is not worth it for me to pay the shipping, take the time and return the book."
5,Hoover is the best !,I love this carpet machine because it does what I needed it to do. It cleaned my carpet's really good and it also cleaned the carpet and car seat's in my van they look like brand new.
1,Not worth the money or trouble.,"The ease of use is far below average. I've used other ""steam"" cleaners and none were this difficult.After finally getting it assembled, it took all my strength to just be able to pull it along the carpet because it does not have a tilted handle. Then when I tried to use the attachments, it got worse. It took me forever, while using instruction manual and youtube instructional videos, to even get the hand tools assembled. And then they didn't work!! A little dribble of liquid came out, but there was no suction although it was hooked up correctly. So I never even was able to use the hand tools.Oh, and then to find where the cords, hoses, and hand tools go once you're done? Forget about it.NOT WORTH THE MONEY, TIME, AND HASSLE!!"
2,Useless after 2 years,"I bought a similar steamvac (SpinScrub F5915-900). The product was ideal for the first two years (used about 3 x a year on a small room carpet), easy to use, job well done . . . till the brushes quit working. If you ""google"" this problem, you will see it is quite common and the suggestions for repair did not help. The vacuum is useless without the brushes so there it sits."
1,Hoover 5912-900 carpet cleaner,"Cheap, cheap, cheap plastic especially on the bottom that is against the carpet.This cleaners plastic will crack AT various places and wou will have fun trying to Super Glue thecracked pieces back together again. FORGET IT. IT'LL NEVER WORK PROPERLY AGAIN.Since everything comes from China with lead in it, you would think that Hoover would have the decency toat least use lead for the stress plastics."
5,LOVE IT!!,"This is a wonderful machine. Easy to use, cleans well, and if you go slowly over the wet areas it dries within an hour. one thing to be careful of--the tank that holds the soap needs to be ""wiggeled"" while pushing down on the handle to snap it into place. Other than that-buy it-you won't be sorry. Good cleaning machine for the buck!!"
4,Excellent SteamVac,"I have three dogs and have had a lot of traffic on my carpets. This steamvac cleaned the carpet areas very well. I was very impressed with the amount of dirt that it pulled up versus other steamvacs that I have used on the carpets in the past. It definatley works much better than the kind you can rent from the grocery store. The only issues that I had with it was that it took a long time to clean the carpets (had to go really slowly for it to clean well), but that could have been because the carpets were so dirty. The handheld cleaner for upholstery was a little bulky for small jobs.Overall I am very happy with my purchase. Hoover offers an excellent warranty also."
5,great product WORKS GREAT,"this is the best steam cleaner it really gets your carpets looking like new again and I was very surprised that it worked great on old stains as well. I love the attachments for the furniture as a pet owner the attachments and the cleaner work wonders. I especially like the turbo surge button this works for the high traffic areas and I have 2 dogs that like to roll around the carpet to itch there backs and these spots get dirter,so this feature works GREAT for cleaning the deep down areas, makes my carpet's look new again!This is also easy to use to fill the water and empty it too, I am VERY mechianically not smart but this is soooo easy to figure and and use it is a breeze! I LOVE MY cleaner."
3,"Does the job, but problems with leaking","I found that this product does a good job cleaning the carpet. It doesn't soak it through, and I couldn't believe the amount of dirt that it removed from the carpet. However, it has a serious leaking problem, so bad that I am considering calling the manufacturer for a new product. When using the hand tool the device still leaks from the base. Also unless you use the entire cleaning solution or remove the compartment completely after you turn it off it will leak all over the floor. Overall, it's aggravating but still effective at cleaning."
1,On 3rd Machine and it just broke...Again!,"I rarely write reviews but this machine pissed me off enough. The first one just stopped sucking up water one day so we got a second one under warranty. The second one just started making a high pitch noise (3rd or 4th use) and stopped working so we got a third one (through the warranty). This one also did the same thing during the first use. At this point, I am willing to pay to have someone take this crappy machine from my house. Do not buy - go with Bissel! I wish amazon let us give zero stars."
3,"Powerful For A Decent Price, But Watch Out For The Warranty...","This steam cleaner works very well. Separate tanks, heated air pushed out directly on the carpet, a heater that keeps the water hot and the 6 spin brushes. There is so much to like about this steam cleaner. The on board attachment system can be a bit of a hassle needing to remove the lid of the tank to set it up but for what this cleaner can do I'm willing to forgive that. We did have an issue after a year of having the cleaner that part of the plastic on the bottom had broken off. After taking it to a hoover repair center they said they would refuse to fix it and even tried to deny the existence of a warranty. Even though this cleaner works well when it's new, don't count on much help when a manufacture defect shows up while you're still under warranty. 3 stars for the good job this cleaner can do but -2 stars for the after purchase service of hoover."
1,"Poor Quality build, Matierals, Instructions and Broken during assembly.","I was hesitant to purchase this after the negative reviews, but it seem they are correct. Hoover has gone downhill in the build quality of their products. While assembling this product one of the clips immediately broke that hold the bottom container in place.I have a return receipt in the mail and I am NOT ordering a replacement but a refund.I had high hopes for this product but am very very disappointed."
5,Wonderful tool,"We are so pleased to have this new machine. It is lightweight and very easy to use. It does a great job of cleaning the carpets and upholstery as well. It didn't feel like a huge ordeal to do this cleaning when all feels so fresh afterwards.Love it.Thanks,"
4,Love it!,"I just purchased my second Hoover Spin Scrub. For the money, its worth every penny. The first one may have only lasted two years, but it sure did a lot of carpets. Mine, and my whole family, we shared it all around. My youngest daughter finally ruined it by putting a lot of bleach in the machine, then letting it sit with it in there. I have used light bleach solutions in the past, and rinsed the machine, with no problems. Its easy to use and does the job, and I am a clean carpet FANATIC!!! I usually go over it twice, just because I am so picky, and I do my apt. every 3-4 months. Bissel has some excellent carpet cleaning solutions also, that contain scotchgard, which I recommend. It is true that the hotter the water, the better it cleans."
4,Does good job but,"I think it does a good job, but I seem to have trouble once in a while with the sucking up of the water on the rug. It scrubs and the soap dispenser works, but I have had trouble with the tank in the bottom sucking up the water. All and all it is a good scrubber."
4,My new best toy!,"I found this carpet cleaner to be easy to use and a ""work horse"". I immediately started in our master bedroom, intending to do a room a day, but just kept going through the house! I even continued on over to an elderly neighbor's home! It removed an amazing amount of dirt. My only complaint is the frequent filling and emptying due to the size of the containers."
2,Carpet shampooer F 5914900,"Machine worked extremely well for 3 weeks. Then the sprayer stopped working and then the brushes. Nice machine but high price for 3 weeks use. The warranty requires that we take the machine a minimum of 42 miles to an ""authorized Hoover service center"" I would guess we would have to leave it to be repaired and then another 42 miles to reclaim it. Would probably be cheaper to buy another shampooer. Warranty is not worth much."
4,okay,"If the vacum quits picking up the dirty water, make sure the panel on the front of the dirty water tank is fully in the down position."
4,SAVES A LOT OF MONEY,"I usually use very reputable cleaning companies and spend a fortune for them to clean the carpets, but the cost is rising...Time for a new plan! After reading many reviews I commited. I like the results for ordinary dirt. I should have bought the spot treatment though since you don't want to over saturate. I tried one on hand and it didn't get anything up. So consider getting a larger bottle of regular solution(the included bottle is 16 oz., enough for small 3 rooms) and a bottle of spot treatment.Drying was surprisingly quick!Rinse cleaner thoroughly when you're done so debris doesn't clog the tube as it dries. I ran it through with clean water in the tub.It's really not too heavy or a struggle to run. Go slowly, like the directions say. I tended to rush like I was vacuuming.A good investment!The only Hoover with 2 year warranty too, I believe."
4,Can't beat the price!,"Love this carpet cleaner! I was a little skeptical at first purchasing another carpet cleaner. I previously owned a Bissell...what a waste of money! This cleaner does an awesome job and is reasonably priced! Just remember to take it slowly and make sure you get the lid seated correctly on the emptying tank (you'll catch on after the first time you use it) and you'll do just fine!!! I received this cleaner within 3 days of ordering it. Amazon, you are awesome!"
4,Great for carpet,"This Hoover SteamVac did a great job getting my really dirty carpet clean! It takes some elbow grease to haul around, and must be refilled with soapy water pretty frequently. But the payoff is worth it! My only complaint is that I tried the upholstery attachment on my cotton sofa and it seemed almost impossible to use. However, my husband used the attachment to clean our van (which is fuzzier - more carpet-like - fabric), and he thought it did a really good job."
5,Hoover 5914-900 Carpet Cleaner,"This hoover steam vac does a beautiful job cleaning the carpets. Have not tried it on upholstery but I expect it to work well there also. You do have to be careful when inserting the water containers. If they are not sealed, no water will be available to the cleaner. I especially like that the containers are small enough to easily lift.I would recommend this product. The value is good for the job it does."
2,Hoover SteamVac Scrub TurboPower Carpet cleaner F5912900,"I am disappointed because I have a 10 year old Hoover steam cleaner that was so much better I am going to get it fixed! It is not suctioning,so should be repairable. The cleaning path is shorter and the whole unit feels cheaper. I did pay more for the original Hoover, but it has more quality. The power cord is now shorter and not as sturdy."
3,Tasty but hard to chew. Could have been fresher.,I was disappointed in the freshness of the product. I am a bit'o'honey lover from many years past and was glad to find them available on Amazon. Maybe the products could be dated for freshness and the candy would be softer like I remember from my past.Kathryn Schroeder
2,Page Turner,"I was very disappointed with this book. I am an avid mystery reader, and I felt this book was going along at a good pace until the end when the couple just took off without any explanation. I don't like to be left hanging like that without ideas to think about. I have heard the movie was great - maybe I should have just rented it."
4,Good in Its Time,"I read this book when I was a teen, and I loved it because it was my first exposure to courtroom drama -- not counting the Perry Mason books, which were, true, courtroom drama, but were somewhat sanitized. I thoroughly enjoyed the Upper Peninsula of Michigan setting: this felt very real to me, as did the small town setting. I liked this book a lot when I first read it and I suspect I would like it today, though I would think the pace was slow."
4,A U. P. Classic,"After my wife and I spent a weekend in the Big Bay Point Lighthouse in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, I felt I had to read Robert Traver's novel, based on a real murder in the little town of Big Bay. Though it's dated, it's entertaining. The movie, I think, was better."
3,Anatomy of a Murder,Price and delivery time were very good. However the binding was not very god and sections of the book separated from the backing.
2,A dated potboiler.,"A bestseller in its day (the 1950s), this novel is of interest now mainly as a period piece and as the source for the celebrated Otto Preminger film. ""Robert Traver"" was the pen name of a former prosecutor and judge who wanted to write a novel that showed what *really* happens in a murder trial. He more or less succeeded in the accuracy department, but otherwise this novel is a fairly routine potboiler, with a touch of sex and violence, a wrongly slandered maiden whom only the hero appreciates, an alcoholic mentor who helps the hero behind the scenes, a scrappy secretary who never gets paid on time, etc.Readers looking for a novel about a trial that is both accurate and well written would be better off buying *The Just and the Unjust,* by James Gould Cozzens. If you choose to read *Anatomy of a Murder* or to see the film, you would also benefit from reading the chapter on the film in *Reel Justice,* which points out some ways in which the story is less than accurate."
2,You *KNOW* Things Are Bad When You Like LILA'S Storyline!,"Same old, same old. There's your general recap ""here's what's happened lately, because yes, if you're reading book 100, you naturally haven't read everything before it!"" Liz acts completely out of character throughout the entire book, from coming up with the jungle prom, to battling it out for prom queen. It's seriously sad, never before in the series has Lila actually been likable to me until this book, where her storyline was the only one I found even remotely interesting. It's also annoying how much the foreshadowing is repeated--nobody could miss this stuff. Yes, yes, we GET that they don't know they're running against each other. We get that they hate each other. Stop hammering it over our heads!Maybe what ruined this for me was the fact that I read all the sequels to the miniseries before I actually read this one. No suspense for me!Rating: 2/5"
5,This was a perfect example of true sibling relationships.,"This book had a really suspenful plot. It also showed you exactly how two normal sisters fight over things, and that's something I can relate to. This book is about Jessica and Elizabeth setting up a Jungle Prom, and they fight over who will be crowned the Queen. Then, Jessica gets so obsessed that she does something that changes her life. Forever."
4,"Fast-paced, Fun, Something you have to read!","As for my review, I would say this is a book that every teen who has faced the urge for revenge should read. Jessica, Elizabeth and the rest of the gang display their true emotions as a rival school tries to give the impression that Big Mesa is the better school, resulting in an all-out war that becomes deadly. Read the book to find out what I mean"
4,old school rap at its best,I'd get this just to hear do the right thing which should have been on spike lee's soundtrack around that time song had a positive message and yeah pump it hottie I requested that song jusat to see this girl dance back in 89.
1,Washing machine shutoff valves,Blatantly misrepresented. Description says Mfg. by Plumb Pak in the United States.Part # PP2056. When received they came from Ace Hdwe. and plainly says Made in China. Thouroughly disgusted and not very happy with Amazon.
3,"Fun, but not her best","I usually love her tapes, but this one is one of her earlier work outs, and not her best."
3,Fillervator?,"It's very true that Derrick May, along with ""Belleville Three"" cohorts Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson, was one of the people who both invented and defined techno. And it's true that his works have been of critical, crucial importance throughout the 80s and early 90s. But this release, while it contains a lot of important material, also contains a lot of filler, and as a result has a real unfocussed feel to it. Plus there are some rather glaring errors. Track titles are transposed in a few cases on disc 2, plus the first track of this disc has its audio totally hammered by being mastered out of phase, causing a really unpleasant sound on one of the more important tracks of the set. And how many mixes of 'Strings' do we really need, honestly? C'mon Derrick...enough of this, and put out a _real_ new release already!"
4,Smooth music,This album is great. I purchased this for the Ralph Myerz track alone but found that the first half made it all worth it. I'm not crazy about the albums second half bt overall its a great listen.
2,"A Bumpy, Uneven Ride","This could have been a wonderful book, in fact, parts of it are quite good. But overall, the book gets bogged down by the snotty, I'm-smarter-and-more-hip-than-you'll-ever-be tone of its author. Brinkley intersperses snippets of regional history with reminiscences about the adventures he and his students had while touring through those regions. I bought this book fully expecting to prefer the personal pieces to the history, but found the opposite to be true. Being a Canadian with little more than a very basic level of exposure to U.S. history, I can honestly say I learned a good deal from this book.But in between those chunks of history, one has to bear Brinkley's endless name dropping (he knows Ken Kesey and knew William S. Burroughs, to name but two) and his oh-so-appropriately chosen tapes to play while rolling through each stop on the tour. (Elvis in Memphis, LL Cool J in LA.)Brinkley should stick to writing pure history and leave the personal stuff out."
1,Much ado about nothing,"The writer has an enormous list of the various names of the legendary gods at his command, using it without much explained commonality I found this bewildering, boring and tedious. I did not finish reading the book."
2,short term fix,"Initially pleased with the ease and convenience of this product but after a few months, the crystals started falling out. Ended up throwing it away."
1,don't buy this item,This item doesn't work and when charing it gets extremely hot. I found this product to be useless for removing water or musty smells and dangerous to charge.
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased this to put inside my small car (hatchback size) to help with the musty scent due to residual water damage to the upholstery. I've had it for about a month and so far it hasn't done anything at all to reduce the musty smell or humidity in the car on certain days. A box of Arm and Hammer Baking Soda (the kind that you put in your fridge) works better for odors.I've tried other products and most of them are heavily-scented and I was hoping that this would be a nice alternative. Sadly, not."
1,mini dehumidifier,"used in my gun cabinet, hasn't changed the humidity one way or the other inside of it. i have a digital humidity gauge to check so i know im right. waste of money!!!!!!!!"
1,Wanted it to work - not sure why it didn't for me.,"I saw a couple people give these bad reviews but paid attention to the good ones because I had high hopes for such a neat product. After several weeks in a greenhouse next to mold-prone plants, the three Eva-dry units I purchased haven't done anything. Literally, nothing. They haven't soaked up an ounce of water, when moisture is surrounding them. It's possible I got a bad batch. Don't know. But I feel like you should probably not waste your time."
4,"Eva-Dry is a good product works well, simple to operate","This is a very good product, it works very well. I put it in my safe and it keeps it nice and dry"
5,Works well in small spaces,"I used to get damp clothes and mold on my clothes/shoes in the closets of my 2nd home whenever I visited during the raining season. Since I started using Eva-dry, the problem has disappeared - (I have two of them in each closet). Overall, I am satisfied."
1,Confirmed scientifically that it does not work,"This product was placed in a sealed, 220 cubic foot area for 48hrs along with a separate temperature/humidity monitor*. After 48hrs, the humidity in the area was 90% ! The product did nothing whatsoever to abate humidity. This did not surprise me particularly after actually seeing the device as I learned that it is 100% passive and doesn't even have a fan to move air over it's passive, water-absorbing pellets. I would think that to work at all it would need at least a fan. What then is this ""wireless"" claim you ask? Well, allegedly, once these pellets are saturated with water, you can plug the device in and it will heat the pellets or something, causing them to release their water, making the pellets reusable... but still worthless since it doesn't really do anything to begin with.* yes the humidity monitor works, I have confirmed it against other humidity sensing devices."
3,its ok,I bought this for my closet.. it seems to work pretty well It's definitely made for a small space.
2,Usless near water,"I bought this for a 4 foot by 5 foot room with a shower. This room has no plug, so I purchased this item. I have to recharge it 2-3 times a week. It was a waste of my money."
1,dont waste your money,This product does not work at ALL. Save your money. This was a complete waste of my hard earned money. Look elsewhere
1,Not a good design,"Quite, and you cannot tell if it is working or not. So I return this product. They should design this product such that users can easily figure the product is in working condition."
4,Great Item!,"Works very well in small spaces, such as closets. To recharge, only plug in out of the reach of small children and pets, as it gets VERY HOT!"
3,"Works, but the 8-10 oz are a big lie","Good thing is, it works as described, but either my physics/math are wrong, or there is hidden magic.I had the unit out for 8 weeks, the stuff got extremely purple... so its soaked and full. Put it on a scale, about 950 grams, 24hrs later, 820 grams, that's 130 ml = 4.39582295 US fluid ounces. I'm pretty sure even if I would let it sit for a couple more weeks to soak, or dry even longer it would ever reach 8-10, dont even see the room where it could go.So basically its a dishonest description for one part, but the idea works."
1,Does not absorb humidityu,"I was very happy to read about this dehumidifier and bought it to use in my small chest freezer that I use for fermenting beer. I keep the freezer at about 68F using a temperature controller, and it is well sealed. I noticed that I still got a lot of condensation on the walls of the freezer and so I assumed that the fermenting beer was just producing too much humidity for the thing to control. But it never changed color. I ended up taking it out after a month or so, and the color of the desiccant was the same as was when it went in. I ran the drying out cycle and it did not make any difference that I could see. I left it out in an unconditioned space over about a month in Florida and it still did not change color. It seems to me that it just doesn't work"
4,Using in my freezer,I have a freezer converted to a kegerator and use this to help keep moisture from forming on the bottom. A lot easier to use this than to mop up condensation.
1,Did not reduce humidity,Does not work. Followed directions exactly and it does not work. Humidity level did not change at all after several days in gun safe. They refunded the money immediately.
5,Great Product,I use EVA 500 in my RV while not in use. I have a large RV so it requires 4 units. They do a good job and are perfect because they don't need to be plugged in. i have used all of the other disposable moisture absorbers. Most are messy and none work as well as this product.
1,Unhappy With Product,"I have a humidity sensor in my closet. Prior to owing this, my humidity level was 60-62%. My current level of humidity, using this product, is 60-62%. I do keep the door to my closet closed. The indicator shows blue. I don't know what I could be doing that would make the unit not work.Basically (I guess) the dry/wet indicator has some colored balls in it and (I guess) the color of the balls changes from blue (dry and ready to use) to pinkish orange (wet and needs recharging). Also, the unit comes with a hook that (I guess) attaches to the holes in the plug (since I am unable to find any other holes for the hook to attach to). Finally, the reason I append my comments with ""I Guess"" is because of the instructions, which are not clear. Although not the worst instructions I have ever seen, they are quite minimal."
1,Falls off wall circuit and breaks - what a mess!,"I purchased four of these units. After seeing pink balls on two of the units I plugged them securely into wall circuits and went to work. When I arrived home I found that both of the units had fallen out of the wall and broke. It took 20 minutes to clean up all the little balls and who knows what those little balls are and if they're harmful when rolling around loose - I know I couldn't possible have gotten all of them. You have to buy a strip circuit and have it sit on the floor when you plug the unit in. Eva-Dry needs to tell the user this!I phoned Eva-Dry and left a detailed message for the Manager as to what happened and to please call me and he never returned my call. This is a company with no customer service, how sad."
2,Not for Gun Safes,"I put the E-500 and a humidity meter in my safe. After 24 hours, there was no change in the humidity level. I recharged the E-500 for 15 hours and returned it to the safe. After another 24 hours, there was no change in the humidity reading. I took the E-500 out of the safe and put in one of the rod dehumidifers that works by warming the air. After only a few hours the humidity dropped 4%. I believe that while the E-500 does capture moisture, it is grossly undersized for this task."
2,Hmmm...does this work?,I have had this unit for around 3 weeks. I have not noticed any change in my bathroom or front closet. It is still completely blue and has not changed at all. At this point I would not purchase another one. I am not sure what to think??
1,It broke!,"I purchased the Eva-Dry a few months ago to go into a safe and it worked fine until I dried it again today. I plugged it in and when I went back to check on it I discovered that it was sitting in a puddle of water. The display window was clouded with moisture, too. I disconnected it and let it sit for a couple of hours. I checked it again and this time it wasn't wet any longer, but I noticed that the beads in the display window had turned white. I have no idea what is going on with this item, but I'm reporting it as BROKEN! This is a significant loss as it is too late to return it. Very disappointing."
5,Bought two! Work Well!,"I bought one to keep in my truck when I store it, it keeps it fresh and no musty smells, and the other is in my boat when in storage! Work great!"
4,does the job,"does a good job of removing moisture from the area. take less than 1 day to recharge. a little pricey, but does the job.i would recommend this product to a friend."
1,not pleased,I purchased 2 mini dehumidifers for a small humid closet anticipating I would rotate them while one recharged. It has been 2 humid weeks and the mini dehumidifer hasn't changed color to indicate it is absorbing any of the air moisture.
3,E 500 mini dehumidifer,"the first day i received them, i put them in my rifle safe that holds 14 guns. the 2 mini dehumidifer lasted 19 days before i had to recharge the two of them. hilo, hawaii is very humid and rainy, i would have given them a 5 if they lasted at least a month."
1,Same color all year long!!!,"This ""Eva-dry 500"" which I own has never changed color. It is always white (before & after recharging). But the idea (or add)was just great!!! Do you think manufacturer own us some refund ?"
1,Dont have capacity,"Its have a perfetc size, but its poor for figth with the humidity.It no reduce the humidity. Poor performance"
1,Don't buy,This damn thing doesn't even work. I charges it twice and still it never collects moisture. Do not but this. Great concept but could not deliver.
2,Doesn't work well for me at all! :(,"I have followed all direction and this product does not work in my safe to keep the humidity down. I have charged it for the allotted time required and in the safe the humidity level does not even drop at all. Not too happy with this, I would recommend it to anyone for a safe...maybe for something smaller but not a safe."
2,okay....for a closet,"I live in a 400 sq. ft. cottage. thought this would be perfect.Nope. The description says it doesn't need recharging for 60 days, but I end up having to plug it in every week or so.Probably best for walk-in closet sized rooms.After about a week, the scented insert was scented-no-more."
4,Good but needssupport in some outlets,"I would give it five stars if it stayed in the receptacle when recharging. This is not necessarily a fault of the unit, but its design. Some receptacles are looser than others. I support it from beneath and it stays plugged in for charging.As a gun cabinet dehumidifier, it works perfectly. It could be no better."
3,okay but not great,convenient and portable. Can put in closed spaces like fridge. Decreased humidity a little but not much though.
1,Not working,"Instruction manual doesn't provide sufficient information for activating the device, I am unable to figure out whether device is working or not."
1,Eva-dry E-500 renewable wireless mini dehumidifer,"Waste of money! Has not done anything and it has been about a month since I put it out. Doesn't come with good instructions so I don't know if it is that I have to do something special. Either way, I'm getting ready to return it. Don't recomend this at all."
4,Great Dehumidifer,Works great in both closets and cabinets. Very easy to regenerate. Looks like it will last forever.
2,nearly useless,"I found this unit to be not substantially better than the 300 (basically the same unit, only larger). I have had this in a bathroom (quite small) and have recharged it twice in the first week. this is something of a challenge, as the plug is attached to the unit in such a way that it effectively hangs on the wall, but is really too heavy for an outlet where it doesn't rest on the floor.Despite it filling and being recharged twice it has not made any noticeable difference in a very small room.Although it is twice the price I'd recommend the petite electric over this unit- which for us has made no difference at all )in brief, no matter how inexpensive, a waste of money)."
2,NOT for quick dehumidification,"This little device is great for small, closed areas with poor ventalation such as a closet where you only need to dehumidify the area OVER TIME. These are NOT of any use for quick dehumidification of an area... especially if there is any circulation at all. For that you will need an active dehumidifier with a fan, etc."
4,"Great for small rooms (closet, bathroom, shed)","These keep the moisture level down to an acceptable level in our 8'x8' storage sheds, just have to remember to plug them in every so often to clear them out. We have been very happy with them."
3,Works I guess,"The thing seems to work as advertised but maybe it's just that I have too much moisture here. I don't really see any improvement in the moistness of my closet even though this thing gets full and recharged monthly.I blame the pacific northwest personally, but also thus device could be slightly underperforming. It's kind of awkwardly designed too."
1,Waste of money,This thing cant even control humidity in a small closet. I wanted to get it to help prevent moisture so my shirts wouldn't develop a mildewy smell over time in a closet and it didn't even lower the humidity at all! These things are full of those little beads they ship electronics with. They DO NOT WORK in large spaces simple as that. I Don't care how big the pack is it doesn't work. You pretty much need an air tight container for this thing to make a difference. Avoid purchase and If I could get my money back I would!
2,defective,"I'm going to guess mine was just defective because if it wasn't i can't see anyone wanting to purchase this.I had it for a week 1/2 in my bathroom (used for showers daily)that's maybe 100sf with NO windows and the balls never changed color. Also the room never felt any less humid. It's very hard to tell if this was working or not but even if it was working ..the ""difference"" it made wasn't substantial enough to meet my expectations. thankfully, amazon accepts returns. I have now purchased eva dry 1100 electric , hopefully that will work out better. I thought since this said up to 500sf the other one would have been overkill but guess I thought wrong. glad it worked for some people but i can't recommend it. and yes, plugging it in to recharge is very awkward an extension cord would be the best way to recharge."
3,good purchase - good price,"good purchase - good price - good serviceMy one complaint is that I had to go online to find out how to hang the items in closets as there were NO instructions with the item on this, although a hanging apparatus was included and advertised."
1,Not a good unit,I would not suggest this to anyone. I got this unit and changed it based on the instructions and it just would not work. called the Mfg support and left several messages with no reply.In the end I returned it to Amazon and they issued credit with not problems. best experince was with Amazon. Well done
3,UNKOWN DATA,"Well I really Don't Know! it looks cool, its cleaner then its competitors,(No mess, No water to dump, No need to buy refills) But seriously You cant really tell if its working on not. Sure the crystals change colors, But hell I use to have a shirt that would change colors- remember those (I know sad). Like I was saying my condensation problem is probably so bad this little thing has no effect. I don't remember the area it is suppose to cover, But I would think it might be good for a food pantry, as long as you didn't have any liquids or can goods in there then it would probably work. or maybe is you bought six or seven of them they might show some sort of result. In my opinion out of five It's a three Just for design. I can't give it any more unless I actually new the amount of water it was removing from the air."
1,Very Disappointed,"After reading reviews we were really excited to receive our Eva-dry E-500, to take care of a humidity problem in some kitchen cabinets. We bought a larger size than we should have needed. Now we wonder if all those great reviews are planted by company employees or are written by people living in the desert. Here in our humid coastal climate this product is useless. We see absolutely no improvement in humidity problem that we have in our kitchen. We consider this a complete waste of money."
5,Just what I needed,"I currently have a similar item which I have been using for years. When this one came, I was surprised to find it being Larger than expected. That is good."
5,great for a safe,"purchased this to keep the inside of my fire safe from getting too humid. The high humidity had been causing things to smell musty and metals to rust. The product works as advertised. You just need to remember to ""recharge it"" every month or two."
4,Works well,"I noticed the difference in my safe within 24 hours. It began working immediatly. The only complaint was that it was bigger than expected (for something called ""Mini"". I would recommend this."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for Any Safe","I use two Eva-Dry EDV-E-500 dehumidifiers to assure that contents of the safe are kept dry. The best solution when you do not have provisions for an electric unit. If the crystals start to indicate presence of moisture, remove the EDV-E-500 and plug it into a 120 volt power strip overnight - do not plug unit into a wall socket directly, as it will likely fall out. Reasonably priced protection. Definitely a five star purchase!"
3,"Works OK, not enough for my application","Filled with standard chemical dehydrating material (color changing silca) this product helps, but does not eliminate the moisture that builds up in my chest freezer (13 cubic feet) that I use for serving homebrew. I use an external temp. controller to hold the temp at 32F for lagering (now sweating) or 50F for serving ales (lots of sweating).So I still have to wipe the moisture up with a cloth, but not as frequently."
1,Doesn't do anything,There were so many good reviews for this product I can't understand how it bad it is. I put one in my car and one in my closet. After about a month they were still blue. Then once I left a car window cracked open accidentally and it rained that night. The next day the seat and inside the door was pretty wet...but the balls were still blue! Why? Next I put a large Damprid free hanging bag in my closet and after 3 weeks the bottom bag is 1/2 full of liquid. But these balls were still blue. Maybe there's an on switch with these I didn't flip. I dunno...
5,Evadry 500,"I had two of the coffe can silica products in my safe before I bought these. I did not like having to put them in the oven to recharge, plus I was having to recharge them every 3 weeks. My safe stays at 40% humidity in the winter now with two of these and I only recharge them every 6 weeks. Awesome product."
2,Consider your usage pattern before buying,"This item did absolutely nothing to reduce humidity in my safe. Humidity was running 5-10% ABOVE outside the safe.I called the manufacturer and they said that because I was opening the safe daily that it would not be able to keep up and that it won't work as designed. They said it needs 25-30 DAYS to remove humidity from a safe. Hardly acceptable; the contents might rust before then.So if you are someone who is buying this for a safe, if you leave it unopened for long periods of time it might work for you, but if you open it frequently look elsewhere."
3,not sure,My rating is because I'm not sure how to use this. I believe I am following instructions by just leaving it in my space and waiting for the teeny tiny indicator window to turn colors. But I haven't seen any color changes yet. Am I supposed to be turning it a certain way? Right now it is sitting upright on a table in a small room. I've moved it from one place to another in the room and the little window is still gray. Waiting for a big 'user error' sign to appear!
1,junk - broke during the first re-charge,Tried to re-charge the item and it wouldn't work. Even left it plugged in longer than the 14 hours it tells you in the instructions. Unfortunately it was past the amazon return policy and the mfg warranty states you have to register in 30 days...what a terrible policy.
3,Eva-dry E-500 Renewable Wireless Mini Dehumidifier,I guess the dehumidifier is working. It's been in the gun safe since Christmas and there has been no change in the strip. Gun safe doesn't appear to be damp. If there was some way to know for sure it's working I'd give it five stars because I like the concept.
1,No change in humidty,"I purchased two of these units and have yet to see any change in relative humidity in the several locations I have tried them out. The units do slowly collect some water, evident when they are recharged and show a bit of condensation in the viewing window, but the reality is they are not removing anywhere near a substantial amount of moisture. I have used a hygrometer, and even in a tiny enclosed space did not see the relative humidity budge from its 60% level of the surrounding air."
4,Overall good product.,"Purchased 5 of these for small space (less than 30 cu. ft.) dehumidifiers. Having purchased multiple units, I can understand more of the comments read previously. Some of the units were still ""dry"" and had the dark blue tint that shows a dry condition of the media, while others varied with some showing more of a pink cast. Just simply ""recharge"" unit for 10-12 hours, it'll be dark blue, and put it to work. Units have mostly turned from blue to pink in 2-3 weeks with local humidity @ 50% or so. Use power strip on floor to recharge, and it'll work fine. Not sure this would be the right product if you needed something for several hundred cubic feet or more, but it seems to work great on small areas."
1,Don't waste or money,I don't find that this product works. I don't see blue or pink anything that changes color so for me it's a big waste of money.
4,Good choice for searay cabin,Have it in the cabin of my 25 ft searay. Very dry - no more mildew. Easily recharged. So far so good
3,Little to no instruction,Seems ok put it in a small closet and it doesn't seem to work terribly fast or well..Won't be getting another one
5,Great Product,This is a great product for a safe. It needs to be recharged every couple of weeks in the summer. In the winter it only needs to be recharged about every 12 weeks or so for me.
2,Breaks Easily,"I got this dehumidifier for the summer months at my college. At first it worked well, with a (slightly) noticeable difference in air quality. Unfortunately, I know from firsthand experience that the material used to soak up moisture is a tiny charged glass resin ball. Before the dehumidifier had finished discharging even once, it split on its seam after being tossed gently onto a bed, spilling tiny beads EVERYWHERE. It was impossible to put it back together because of the nature of the crack, so my roommate and I were left cleaning up tiny glass beads (which, by the way, crush easily) for the rest of the day.Overall pretty good if you KNOW it'll never move, drop, get bumped, but not very durable, well-made, or even particularly effective in my experience."
2,Misunderstanding on how to use,I thought this only needed to be charged and then would work unplugged. I don't see evidence that it is working.
5,Use in my boat.,I have 4 of these in the cabin of my 24 foot cruiser. It really keeps the moister down for storage.
1,Overpriced crap,"If you are trying to fit 2-3 t-shirts and a laptop in this bag, you are out of luck. It will fit but you will look like you have a puffer fish attached to your waist. This is just another book bag with crappy capacity. $100 down the drain."
3,dated video,"This seems to be a very dated video rereleased. No closed caps, and ""old school"" video. It is interesting, but compared to modern video not that good. There must be something better out now."
1,STAY AWAY ! MADE IN CHINA !,"I'VE HAD THIS UNIT IN MY GARAGE FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS AND IT FAILED 17 TIMES ! - ALWAYS WHEN I NEEDED IT ! MY TECHNICIAN DOES NOT WANT TO TOUCH IT ANYMORE ! NOW I AM DEALING WITH THE FACTORY TECHNICIAN IN THE US (I'M IN CANADA ) WHO IS VERY HELPFUL BUT THE WARRANTY ONLY COVERS PARTS - NO LABOUR ! IM IN FOR OVER $450,- IN LABOUR COSTS !"
3,Poor fit makes it difficult to use for Porter-Cable specified use,"This template guide is the one specified by Porter-Cable as the one to use when re-centering the base-plate of their laminate trimmer router. Unfortunately due to the poor fit, either the outside diameter of this is too small and or the inside diameter of the base-plate is too large, either way it does not fit precisely in the base-plate. Without a good fit, its purpose of allowing the base-plate to be re-centered is not achieved."
5,Sura Flow Yoga,Sura's unique perspective on energy healing is really invigorating. I've taken class with her in person and watched this DVD and can highly recommend both!
3,Giant ants! Oh MY!!,"This book has a lot going for it. Ace, The Doctor, 1950's England, and GIANT ANTS!! Sadly, it has a lot against it as well. DO NOT bring back a villian from a previous BBC Past Doctor book. Do not bring back other charecters from past Doctor books. I haven't read them all, so I miss the point. If you have not read the two previous books by these authors, don't read this one. Also, don't kill off Ace (It's on the back of the book, no spoilers) just to bring her back the last 5 pages of the book. Doctor Who is best when there are realistic plausible plots, I get so sick of the ""alternate universe"" cop-out. Again, I would have enjoyed this book much better knowing the charecters. It had a feel of one of the old Virgin New Adventures. Overall, a nice try, but lacked consistant quality."
2,Lavender and Hardly Unisex,"Too much Lavender for my liking! I like the fact that Jao is heading in the right direction from Purell but still find it drying (and not completely natural ingredients PPG, Petrochemical Glycols)."
2,Few interesting points/mostly dribble,"Required purchase for a class. Really just a skim read. The main points that start each section are all that is worthwhile. Don't buy unless you know absolutely nothing about reading literature in front of people; otherwise, practice and look for ""focal points"" and ""oral interpretation"" on an online search-engine."
4,love this parfum,"I have allergies, so most parfums give me headaches. But, this fragrance is very nice and not too powerful. I have been wearing it for years and people always ask me what Im wearing. very nice."
4,Pretty great,"I first came across this perfume as part of a gift box with trial-size perfumes. I really loved this one. When I got the 3.3 ounce bottle in the mail, I was surprised that the smell was slightly different from the smaller size (a bit sharper, stronger). I've either gotten used to it or it has improved with use. Overall a great scent that can be worn at any time of day. Note: unlike other perfumes that might have a lighter scent, it's best to apply this sparingly."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE DID I MENTION LOVE THIS PRODUCT,"always have been and will be my favorite. Adult yet cute and sexy, sophisticated for any female woman, not strong and over bearing has a nice and light scent ."
5,Espectacular,"Espectacular este producto, la fragancia es deliciosa y me llego en perfecto estado, ME SIENTO COMPLACIDA DE HABERLA ADQUIRIDO Y MUY SATISGECHA CON LA COMPRA DE EL."
4,Refreshing!,This is one of my favorites. I'm on my third bottle and will continue to wear this as long as it's being sold.
2,Not really...,"I'm used to using White Diamonds and love it. This was cheaper so I decided to try it. I'm very disappointed. I like that the scent is soft, but it has no personality to it, and doesn't last more than an hour on you.I'm going back to my White Diamonds."
1,This is why America is so lost,"You've got to be kidding me, i bought this book as a joke. This is what kind of ignorance that is spread through our country? No wonder there is so much hate and fear.The path to God is not narrow and alone. There are many roads to rome. If you read this book, also readJesus Christ the greatest Conspiracy Ever Sold. It will open your eyes. It's a sheer fright to think anyone can get a book published. Yes she is well versed and familiar with verbage, but dear God, the fear and anger that is spread!But that's her right to freedom of speach."
1,Probably NOT the most Biblically based teaching you'll ever read...,"Marc Jacobs is the Pastor of ""Church for All Nations"" here in Colorado Springs. Cindy is his wife. While i attended their church i found such incredibly unBiblical teachings as ""Jesus was a rich man and the disciples had PLENTY of money"" to the idea that EVERYONE has the gift of tongues. Their ""church"", and i use the term loosely, is more concerned with buying land and renovating their facility than it is in doing ANY of the works Christ called us to do. When their budget came out only 17% of it was used for mission work. The rest was for salaries, paying off debt (??? since WHEN does a CHURCH have DEBT???) and renovating their physical plant. Moreover, Marc Jacobs and his staff are ""prosperity preachers"" (give to God and he will bless you financially. So, with all THAT in mind? I kind of wonder how Biblically based this book really is..."
5,Available for download,"This book is out of print, but is available for download from a number of sites, legally. Google the title to find them.For those interested in a less than European view of music in the 18th century, this is a good place to start. It is thought that the harmonizations that Billings provided are (in fact) closer to what 'music' sounded like to the ordinary person at this time who did not have access to the harmonic developments of a Bach-educated church musician."
2,FOZZY's new album sucks,"The original songs on the first 2 Fozzy albums were great. I was so excited when I found out that they would put out a full album of originals songs. But boy was I dissapointed! The songs are sappy and have only a few heavy parts. The vocal melodies were kinda boring and the album just sucked in general. There are a few heavy songs on the album that are pretty good. Otherwise, don't buy this."
1,don't even think of buying this,Jericho is a two bit hack w/ a voice of a dying vulture. he needs to stick to wrestling.
5,All That Remains - Album of the year 2005 !!!!!!!,"This album is pure metal. Heavy guitar, heavy drums, heavy bass, and Jericho on lead vocals! This album is relentless from start to finish. Fozzy's 3rd record is a masterpiece. Guest appearances by Zakk Wylde and Mark Trmonti. Absolutely excellent record. This album is above and beyond what I could have imagined. Album of the year!!!!"
3,"Good, but a little too nu-metalish","I thought that ""Happenstance"" was a great album. Even the original track on that record were very good. However, the latest Fozzy effort, ""All That Remains"", dives into the deeper nu-metal grounds, which to me is very dissappointing. Don't get me wrong, more than half of the tracks here are good, heavy, and sometimes hint the melodic roots of Fozzy's previous covers of other artists, but just simply not enough. Sure, today's kids will like this record because this is the only kind of metal they know. However, if you are expecting clear mixing and production, no ""talking"" into mic, and other elements that were present in ""Happenstance"", steer clear of this one. You will NOT be very happy."
3,All That Remains RELOADED is a much better release,"Skip this one, check out All That Remains Reloaded....has a bonus live concert DVD plus this CD, and actually sounds better to my ears!All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)"
3,Anatomical Chart Co. Budget Bucky Skeleton Stand,"This is a good product for the money. The casters were a little flimsy and don't swivel very easily under weight, but otherwise a good stand. Be aware that this stand is made to attach to the base of the spine of a skeleton. We purchased it for an older skeleton that needed to be hung, so I had to fabricate an extension. Still, for the money it is a good stand. Our first one came with a defective rod, and customer service was terrific about sending a new one right out."
4,You'll never get lost in a remote corner of Arkansas,A more detailed road map of Arkansas would behard to find. Very detailed has every interstateand dirt road
1,not as good as a Marks A Lot,"bought a few dozen of these...If you use them outdoors, they will fade. I tested several different brands of markers to see which brand weathered better. Marks A Lot seems to have the best weather resistance... so that is all I buy now."
2,"some of them are dry, no ink","I thought it would be nice for the price,because we use a lot. I bought 10 boxes. But, some of them are dry,even not enough to write one character. GOD!I did return it. I never return products boguth on line. anyway, it is the only one time I bought those makers on line. never next time."
1,Bic should stick with pens,"I bought a couple 2-packs of these, and they are practically useless. They aren't nearly as bold/heavy-writing as equivalent thick permanent markers from other brands such as Sharpie and Marks-A-Lot. After failing to use them for yard sale signs on two occasions, I ended up tossing them."
2,Outdated,"Besides the fact that the book is outdated and does not rely on much new material, the title is wrong! Greene grew up in a Quaker household but by the time of the American Revolution had been kicked out of his meeting for his militia pursuits. Thus, when he was fighting, he was no Quaker and did not identify himself as one!"
5,Suetonius: The Twelve Caesars,"For anyone interested in the source of Robert Graves' ""Claudius"" series, reading Suetonius is mandatory. A fascinating glimpse into Roman political life."
4,Unclear edition,The service was fine- but there are various editions of this work with relatively minor changes in the introduction and other minor matters. There was no way of determining the date of this edition or any of the others from the listings. This was in fact from 1979 rather than 2003
4,"A fine collection of inbred pedophiles, sadists & basic","lunatics that ruled Rome in the first century, & told very well in the audio cassette format. As history it is not much but as biography it is informative & entertaining. Apparently the mores & standards of decency were much diiferent than they are today. Most of these 12 Caesars did not not rule very long but they impacted the Empire probably for a long time after. I'd like to read more about the individuals that followed Domitian & before Julius thus supplementing other well known works such as the Fall of the Roman Empire. This book however, is a good start."
2,horrible shipping experience,"I urge you! if you decide to buy books, you have to order it at least a month an advance. I ordered the book for my school paper. When i received it, i had already got my grade C+.:( I frequnetly shop for books from amazon,it usually takes not more that a week. But, this is the worst shipping experience i have ever had. The good part is that they sent the right book with decent condition"
3,"Twelve Caesars, 3 out of five stars",This is an adequate version of the Twelve Caesars if you are looking to stray from the more mainstream translations. It contains more detail but not enough context regarding the detail to make it a compelling read. If you can read only one stick to the Robert Graves version.
4,Does exactly what it should,"I was a little leery after reading all the issues with the dc4000 device (the single layer version of this DVD burner), but received the dc5000 as a Christmas present. So far it has worked wonderfully. I have a fairly new Compaq Presario (2.5 GHz, 256 MB memory), and it works just fine transferring video from videotape, and I can set up DVDs with menus, etc., just fine with the ArcSoft software. I will agree that the Arcsoft software is less than intuitive, and there will be a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's really quite useful. That said, I have not used any other commercial DVD authoring packages out there, but ArcSoft seems to meet my needs.Overall, it appears that you really need a fast (2+ GHz) computer with lots (256+ MB) of memory for this burner to work well."
1,frustration,"I purchased this DVD writer about 3 weeks ago and have been trying to get it to work ever since.The software is incompatable with just abut every media software I have. I have a Pentium 4(2.4)512MB with ample memory on my harddrive. I am running Windows XP. I managed to get it to work only temporarily to find another probelm once I reboot.It seems ridiculous to pay money for a DVD writer and then spend hours trying to get it to do something it was supppose to do in the first place! Far as I am concered HP has let the consumer down. To expect the consumer toremove CD burning plug-ins ,upper and lower registry keys in Windows is beyond understanding from a manufacturer.Stay away from this HP DC 5000 movie writer!!"
4,"DVD Writer great, ArcSoft Editor some struggles","I bought the DC5000 based on the reviews. The device works great, easy set up and usage. I am struggling with the video editing software. I am using this on a laptop and ArcSoft doesn't want to import my finished video. Currently have a request into ArcSoft. Hope my experience is better than the others. Adobe Premiere and Windows Movie Maker will easily import the file, but I am looking to save it in mpeg format and neither Premiere nor Movie Maker will allow that."
2,It looked great at first... but then the problems came...,"I succeeded to transfer 2 home videos without any problem with the DC5000, but then I ran into serious problems on the sound transfer. Mostly no sound is transferred, sometimes cracky, sometimes just OK, but not predictable when it will go wrong. Changed every cable I used more than once, re-installed software etc... Seems a problem in the USB-transfer has come up which was not there at the start. Waiting for answer from the HP-guys....All in all a frustrating experience."
2,No longevity,"I've had this particular burner/video capture device since March 2005. About a week or so ago, the device started making a really loud fan noise even while the computer was off and it wasn't doing anything itself. I've tried unplugging it and replugging but there is a persistent noise coming from the device. Also, during this time the burner has decided that it occasionally will fail a DVD burn in midstream resulting in DVDs for the garbage. I don't know what's been going on lately with HP but they seem to be severely lacking in support and product quality. I'm in the market for a new system but won't be considering HP if I can help it."
5,EXCELLENT,"I am a huge fan of French new wave so this book was like the icing on the cake, a perfect companion to all my dvds. Did I mention I do NOT speak French? Despite that little complication (I read subtitles very well) I love the movies and I love this book."
5,Absolutely Beatiful as it is Vital to one's Life,"Not only is this book easy to follow and simple to understand and to integrate it into one's daily life, but it's vital importance is simple to understand. It is not only for good health, but to be able to understand its philosophy for longevity (both in mind, body and spirit).I bought this book because of its beauty, while fully understanding its important philosophy and practical excersizes for anyone who would like to read it and gain that knowledge for true personal enrichment.Do not let it's 'simple' cover or the look fool you, or to merely 'brush it aside'. For it is filled with everything that many are commonly seeking: To find their own true essence and growth of their Self."
5,One of Katherine O'Neals best!,"I just finished this book last night, I was up until 4:30AM reading it! I was hooked! The Vallee de mir was fantastic! It's made me want to learn Portuguise and Swahelii, and to go to Seyshells. The characters and setting were fantastic! I've read all but one of Katherine O'Neal's books and let me tell you, this is one of the best!"
3,A Nice Read,This book has a simplistic but charming plot that actually made me laugh out loud at times. When you're looking for a happy and bright book on a gloomy or rainy day this is definately it.I agree with the other reviewer that the book was very choppy at times but it's still worth reading.
1,Needed a better ghostwriter,"I was very excited to find out that the musical, The Happiest Millionaire (which is FABULOUS) is based on a book. Unfortunately, Cordelia did not get a very good ghostwriter. The book is slow, choppy, lacking connective tissue between short childhood memories. There is little character development and no depth."
4,Fine overview of a colorful career,"Like almost all of Tierney's work, this is beautifully drawn and authentic. The book features three dolls, depicting Crawford during different stages of her life and career, from giddy flapper to toughened career broad, and an array of costumes covering everything from her silent films to her '60s horror movies. The likenesses are good in general (although the middle doll is less like Crawford) and the range of costumes--from 18th-century court gown to futuristic and Austrian dance costumes--is enjoyable. Fans of Crawford's career should enjoy this--as I do."
1,Don't do it!,"While ordering Mommie Dearest I thought I'd order this too, to have a few laughs with my friends. Well, the drawing is horrible. Like a faded old Woolworth's ad from the 1950's. Also, you have to cut them out. You can't just punch them out. And, there is barely a likeness between the dolls and Joan. I wish someone had written this review before I wasted my money."
3,Excellent Portrayal of Two Sick People Who Find Each Other,"The story could have been presented without the pointless plot device of ""telling her story all over again"" to a prison psychiatrist. Subtract two stars for that. The main reason to see this film is the surprisingly good performance by Laura Prepon. I can see her career being an effective mix of comedy and disconcerting serious roles (a pattern of film choices similar to Robin Williams')."
1,One of the worst B movives I've ever seen,"- The acting is so fake it's boring.- There is no emotion or suspense. For example, in the scene where Paul and Karla drugged and raped Karla's sister to death, the actors displayed no emotion. It's so insipid that I felt nothingIn short, it's one of the worst B movies I've ever seen. It's better to read the book on this crime."
1,Where to find HELP,"I got this DVD and play it ONLY to find out it is defective. So I check the paperwork which tells me to email any problem, but the problem is there isn't and Email addresst to email problems to. The company I got the DVD from is different then the company that mailed the DVD to me."
1,I just didn't like it,"It followed the true story mostly but if Paul had not used the F word so much he would not had any lines. All he did was rape, kill & beat up Karla. not a intertaining movie. could have been done a lot better, way too much cursing."
3,OK for a Hollywood-version of Karla Homolka,"First, it was tough for me to watch this. Not because of the subject matter but because I actually knew Karla. Growing up in St. Catharines and going to the same high school as Karla and her sisters did, and living literally a three minute walk from where Kristen French was abducted, it's hard to get past the differences in what was filmed to what happened in reality.Overall, the acting is fine and Laura Prepon does a good job, but it was stylized just a bit too much and a bit too far removed to accurately represent the area where everything took place. For viewers who weren't too close to the action it won't be an issue.Good for a Saturday night rental if you're interested in True Crime."
2,Odd combo,"I wanted to watch this movie after watching an A&E documentary on Ken and Barbie killers. It turned out to be an odd combination of a documentary and a thriller, narrated from Karla's perspective and many times showing her as non cooperative, victimised woman but ending on an unsympathetic note to her. (The jury concluded she was 'artificial, manupulative and with a strong moral vaccum bordering on psychosis' but there is no depiction of these traits anywhere in the movie's portrayal of her, just a scared, victimised woman). For a low budget movie though the pace is entertaining and victims treated with respect, their names are changed and no nudity is shown. Perhaps for a boring friday evening."
1,Horrible acting and full of inaccuracies.,"This movie is just awful. If you know anything about the real crimes of Paul Bernardo and Karlma Homolka, you know that the movie is very inaccurate and full of things that attempt to make Karla Homolka look like a victim. She was not a victim, she was a very willing participant. I was so frustrated with how inaccurate the facts were, I couldn't even finish this piece of junk.Aside from the movie being full of crap, the acting was horrible."
3,"Not great, but good",I watched this because I had been reading a book related to the subject. The movie closely followed everything I had read about Karla.
2,Thought there would be more...,"I saw the documentary of these two individuals on youtube & then decided to rent the movie. People keep saying the movie is graphic but I saw no such thing, there's probably 2 scene's you could cut out & the movie could've been made by the Lifetime network. If your expecting to see Laura Prepon naked, 4get it she did however look pretty good in her underwear. When I saw the doc on youtube I had the impression she was a willing participant in everything, when I saw the movie it makes it out like she hated everything & had remorse. Watch the doc on youtube & then rent the movie & watch it for yourself..."
2,Not bad....not close to great though,"Not much to say about it. Those looking for a lot of skin/etc. will be disappointed. Seems like decent performances by the two leads (I really had contempt for the male lead, and was infuriated by the passive acceptance of Laura Prepon's title character) were done in by poor writing and nonexistant supporting cast. Sort of makes me think someone lost a bet and had to be in the flick in the first place, as I certainly think Prepon at this stage in her career can do better than this."
3,Missing Some Valueable Pieces,For anybody who is familiar with this story you won't enjoy this film. It's missing a lot of valueable pieces.If you happen to catch on TV than yeah why not watch it but to buy it is not neeeded.
3,Extremely disturbing movie.,"I did not sleep well at all after watching this movie-nightmares. The extras included on the dvd explain that the movie could not say all of the atrocities, because of the victims family privacy, etc. Many men, including investigators or medical examiners (sic), as per public testimonies somewhat felt physically attracted towards Karla Homolka because of her 'innocent sorority girl in plaid skirt' looks on certain pictures in her (manipulative) 'real life'. After watching this movie and reading about her in Wikipedia, no more of that for sure. I just hope that the actor and actress who accepted to play these difficult to accept (disgusting) roles of PB and KH will not be chastised by the public opinion like the real PB and KH."
3,"O.k., but ....","The movie was o.k., but it definately could have been better produced. It jumps very rapidly through the story without really focusing on detail. It is definately not graffic because they didn't allow time for such detail. The story is also very much told from Karla's view and indirectly portrays her innocence. In the movie extras, they show scenes that shouldn't have been taken out. They would have improved the movie."
1,NOT the FIlm Crew,"Don't be fooled. These idiots are NOT the Film Crew (Kevin Murphy, Mike Nelson and Bill Corbet). They are a bunch of no-talent morons who have absolutely NO creativity or any ability to do anything of interest to anyone beyond themselves. Don't waste your time with these foul-mouthed clowns!"
1,what a mistake on my part...,"When I saw this online, I thought it was 'the Film Crew' with the MST3K gang and opened it up before I realized my error. So I can't get a refund for this trash. I wish as hell I could give this one a ZERO rating. Since I can not, I'll do it here:How do you rate this item? ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO ZEROand finally... ZERO!!!"
1,Watch out! Amazon got this wrong.,"Sorry Amazon. I trusted your suggestion that Film Crew to accompany my order of MST3K The Movie thinking it was the new tv show, Film Crew, done by some of the same guys that brought you MST3K the TV show. In the words of COSMO CRAMER, ""You were WAAAYYY off!""This was literally made in someones basement with people that were barely in their twenties. I couldn't make it through 5 min. I wish I could get my money back. My fault for not looking more closely.Hopefully the creaters of this Film Crew movie use the money for film/acting lessons.Amazon, be more careful next time."
1,Worst purchase ever: complete waste of money,"This was by far the biggest waste of money ever. This DVD was absolutely awful. The producers stole the name from The Film Crew and have mislead purchasers into thinking they are getting something from that group instead of this horrible, horrible waste of time. I strongly recommend that this item be pulled from inventory so that no one else will make the same mistake I did."
1,BE WARNED ! this is the biggest waste of money ever,"i bought this dvd because it came up in a search for the film crew.........so so naturally i assumed it was the same guys that did mystery science theater/ the film crew. was i ever mistaken........this is the worst piece of absloute trash ever , it was a total waste of money .........i took it out of the machine after the first insulting five minutes and threw it away...........BEWARE!!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MINDLESS TALENTLESS JUVENILE GARBAGE!"
2,Fails to deliver on its ambitions,"Samuel Johnson remarked once that learning in Scotland was like bread in a siege town. Everyone got some but none got enough to make a meal. His quip could equally apply to this book. It touches on everything, but doesn't cover anything in sufficient depth. In fact I would tend to view the book as really centered around bringing Fireworks and Freehand into play (contra Illustrator and Photoshop). Freehand and Fireworks get 200 pages each, while Flash gets 90 pages. Dreamweaver gets just under 300 pages, and the surface of many features is revealed. However, there isn't a lot of depth throughout and elaborate examples are avoided. The rest of the book is focused on Cold Fusion (which was not of interest to me).My personal recommendation is to look at specific books for specific components. Compendium type books, often suggest more than they can deliver."
2,Where's the Beef?,"Sure looks like a hefty tome, but where's the beef? This is a fluff of a product overview. If you think you're actually going to LEARN something from this book, you've got another think coming! It attempts the impossible - ""Bible"" on ""Studio MX""? Get real! Don't waste your money."
3,who's behind the mask?,"I saw this as a child in the 40's and enjoyed it a lot, however I couldn't recall the ending which is why I ordered it from Amazon and I thoroughly enjoyed it again. I would not hesitate recommending it to anyone. Sincerely Bob Atwell"
2,Battery Problems,"It seems as if every time I want to use the camera, the battery is dead. I find that if I charge it and try to use it the next day, I should expect very much. I'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes, but I shouldn't have to do so."
3,Great topic and interesting women.,I love to see films in praise of old women......I mean how often do you? I liked the different women they showed and talked about but found myself wishing the quality was a bit better and that the film flowed more and then I would want it to be longer. Still it is certainly worth a look to see what these amazing women are doing!
5,Like a Duck to Water...,"...is how Pavel has made the transition from communism to capitalism. He is a shameless self-promoter, just like Ahhnold, and publishes new books constantly. Each of his books comes complete with a miniature catalog at the end, in case you'd like to buy more of his miracle products.That said, the information contained in this book really is revolutionary, and it really does work, like nothing else I've ever tried, like 8-Minute Abs, Mary Winsor Pilates, the AbSwing, and even one of those electronic devices. I actually bit the bullet and bought Pavel's $... contraption, which is ingeniously made, even though it probably only contains $... worth of material. The bottom line is, the results are practically immediate, because Pavel takes an approach that no one else does. I have three of his books now, and this one is the best."
4,don't buy the pavelizer,The evil russian mentions how Russians launch Cosmonauts in a tin can. Don't buy the Pavelizer: either put a broomsick on the other side of the doorway or buy a basketball and clasp it between your legs. The hip flexors are isolated and your back is fine.
4,Bullet proof abs,"I wish the writer was a little more precise.I found the book to be informative, but it was very lengthy.Also, I hated the marketing of his product(pavelizer)."
3,what they don't tell you,"Everyone is full of praise for the results this book can bring you, and that's great, but no-one seems to want to point out that, just like every other fitness guru in the business, Mr Tsatsouline uses his book to make you buy his - expensive - exercise equipment. In this case, the Pavelizer, which starts at around.... Also, ...for what turns out to be a short book stuffed full of bombast and rhetoric isn't exactly great value for money. Like everything else in fitness, if you have discipline and willpower, you don't need this guy's borrowed wisdom. But then maybe you wouldn't be buying the book in the first place."
4,"Great, But...","As a college student I don't have alot of money. His product the Ab Pavelizer seems like a good invention, but costs a lot of money. The Janda situps, that Pavel recommends, is a great strength builder, but you have to have the contraption or a partner.However, he has some other strength builders, and his approach to excercise is refreshing. Well written and easy to understand, Pavel's book is worth the money."
2,Over priced,"Not nearly enough information for the price of the book. Only a a very few insights into developing the abdominals, and too much advertisements of his own over priced products."
1,Not Worth the Price,What a disappointment. There were no reviews to help me out when I bought this item. I discovered upon receiving it that I'd spent $25 on an instruction book for the very expensive piece of exercise equiptment. It's of no use to me.
3,Bullet-Proof Abs - review,"The focus of the book is on the use of the Pavelizer exercise equipment. There are some other exercises described, but they are fringe exercises to be performed in addition to the Janda sit-ups."
2,Not necessary for abs,This book first of all is expensive. It teaches you positons those you won`t need at all to strength your abs. Never use called Wheel(as he recommends in the book for not using because of back pain) means not tested and used before but just to add volume to the book! I experienced back pain as well after first use of this wheel. They sell those kind of rubish (wheel) on (as seen on TV) as well. Don`t buy this book! I do sports and a martial art for along time and read many books about sports.
2,Just can't care about this book,"I put this book on my kindle a while ago and have read book after book since just can't seem to care enough to finish this. This book doesn't even hold my attention long enough to read, there is always something more entertaining to do, vacuum, sort laundry., Maybe, some day, if I'm stuck with nothing else to do, and am unable to download another book I might just finish it. Maybe."
2,Bad,"This is one of most useless books I've ever encountered. Unlike many annuals and design books which contain some projects which do not meet the highest possible conceptual and design levels, this book contains some of the loudest horrible pieces of design jokes. Some of the projects are so poorly designed that you would stay in shock for a few long seconds while starring at them, not remembering that you can rescue your eyes by flipping the page. Every few months I reopen the book to see if my opinion about it has changed - I ask myself: ""how can there be such a terrible compilation of so much bad work? Surely it's not as bad as I remember it..."" And every time I attempt to review it again I quickly give up and the experience just seems to be even more traumatizing than the last. Get something else."
5,Just Saw This In N.Y. Theater,"I was surprised to find that this was showing yesterday at MOMA here in New York City. I decided to go, as I missed my chance of seeing Joan on the big screen, (I was only 12 when she died), and she had long since stopped making films prior. I owned a copy of this on VHS years ago, but had forgotten most of it.What was amazing to me was how well the film held up in every way, the characters were a hoot, the funny one-liners (""What are you in for?"" ""My boyfriend cut himself on a knife I was holding."")had everyone in the theater cracking up, and Joan herself comes across as the big star that she was at the time, and she demonstrates why she lives up to the title of ""Hollywood Legend"" -With Modern Films aplenty to choose from, I was happy to see the Theater at MOMA nearly SOLD OUT for this showing. 30 years after her death, Joan Crawford is still loved and respected in New York!"
1,Big Disappointment,"This book was a real disappointment. The characters are one-dimensional, the ""mystery"" obvious, and the relationships unbelieveable. Our detective and his lover wax hot and cold on each other for no discernible reason, many characters (notably the family with the Down's Syndrome child) appear to have no relationship to the plot, and the immediate adversary relationship between the hero and his employers makes no sense. I was expecting something that would do for Alaska what Tony Hillerman has done for the Southwest, but our 50th state really got a bum rap!"
5,The Angels Will Not Care,"Like Many others I have read all of John Straley novels. Being a former Sitka resident I find the novels very interesting. I do not think that you have to be an Alaskan to enjoy these books. The characters that are written about are written in a way that allows one to really experience them. The stories are believeable and one gets really drawn in with the stories. Straley is a great storyteller and spins a tale or two. I do not suggest you read only this book, but all of Straley's novels. These books will leave you with a since of longing to travel to the Great Land"
5,Most Recent in a Great Series,"I loved ""The Angels Will Not Care"". I previously read the other books in this series, and what keeps me coming back are the wonderful descriptions of Alaska and the lovable-because-fallible but never self-righteous main characters. I have been passing the books on to my brother-in-law, whose taste in books is completely different from mine--more toward the Grisham-adventure-spy-thriller type story, and he likes them as much as I do."
5,Wonderfully wrought characters,"I have spent some time in Sitka and love it but what keeps me waiting for another Cecil Younger book is the way Straley creates his characters. Cecil is a three-dimensional character with wonderful flaws and strengths. How he views himself and his relationships with others--Toddy, Jane Marie, his lawyer, his various clients--gives a much richer voice than one usually finds in detective fiction. Start with the first book and keep reading! Let's hope Mr. Straley keeps Cecil alive for a long time."
2,Not my type,This book just didn't seem to make it for me. The plot didn't seem to hold together or make a lot of sense.
5,excellent grinder,"Lot of power in this grinder, very good at cancelling vibration, quite heavy, but then, it's a 9 inch, what can you expect. I gave it a beating even at cutting up concrete and brick, and it works like a charm. Definitely worth the money."
5,I remember Voces Y Vistas,"This book was my first venture into learning foriegn languages 13 years ago when I was freshman in high school. I started off in Voces Y Vistas (year 1), moved onto Pasos Y Puentes (year 2), then capped off with Arcos Y Alamedas (years 3 & 4). This series as a whole went into great detail to teach not only vocabulary and culture but I remember conjugating verbs early on as well. A great textbook is no replacement for an excellent teacher (which I had for all 4 years) or a student with a willingness to learn. Luckily all three pieces were there. This series got me so well prepared that I was able to test out of having to take a foriegn language when I got to college. Once again, I think this is a great series. My only complaint are the workbooks that go with it (they were kind of dry compared to the text) and the kind of creepy people featured on the covers of all three."
5,Huge Fan,"I entered flight school in 68 and went on to a year and halfof rotor work in SVN and parts, in 69. A must read. Glad I found it.This wonderful book took me everywhere..with perfect wit."
5,Captivating!!,"Absolutely a Captivating Read. Five Star Author and a Five Star Work.As with some of the other reviewers, I have no idea why they would believe this to be less of a good work for not being more ""Political"". This was notthe writers intention, and as in anything else completly a matter of parogative. This is an Autobiographical Work, not a political call to arms over awar that happened long ago.So in that vain this stands as a very good and very well written autobiography, It is absolutely captivating.You will not be disapointed and will hardley want to put this book down without knowing what will happen next.Arthur Taliaferro"
3,"Good general dog information, not breed specific.","This book provides good, general information about selecting and caring for any dog. The problem is, the information, while helpful, does not give any real insight about the specific breed. The only breed specific information (and in my opinion, the saving grace of this book) is found in the Chapter dealing with health problems commonly found in GSDs. With the exception of that Chapter, this book could easily be retitled ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Dogs""."
2,Great title lacking passion,"Rensberger's book lifts up important connections between liberation theology and the fourth gospel. His writing, however, lacks passion and fails to get to the heart of the issue until the end of the book. Verbosity keeps the reader from easily discerning his points. Still, there are interesting ideas worth pursuing here."
3,Product OK - shipping fees a little high,"The product itself is good - the quality seems to be OK so far. Positive: Recieved order and shipping information for the shipper (unsolicited updates). The negative: The item weighed about 1 pound (probably less), was shipped via postal mail, and took about 1 week to ship. Considering time, weight, and method shipping charge from this comapny was high at $5.25."
1,Not thrilled,"The compression shorts I bought from Safe-T-Gard were the least expensive ones available, but that price comes with a catch, actually 2 catches. The first one is that although they fit right in every other way, these shorts are uni-sex styling, a fact omitted in the product description but clearly displayed on the package. Now they may fit right for females, but there's just no room for my junk in these drawers. That leads to the second catch, that although I wrote the seller an e-mail asking to rectify the situation, I received no reply.All told, I'd have to say: shop for a quality product that fits, from a supplier that will support their customers."
3,get what you pay for,"The compression shorts are basically what you pay for. The material quality is good, but the assembly lacks. The seams are large & can cause hot spots on long runs rather than prevent. I've had to wear them wrong side out to assist in the large rough seams. The fit is good - just assembly quality is lacking."
5,Compression shorts,I chose this product because of a problem with my hip -- I wanted some support to help the muscles strengthen without putting too much stress on the joint. I have felt more confident wearing them as they have given me this support without binding or constricting.The customer service staff was very helpful in resolving a shipping problem.
5,A Best Buy Find,These are by far the best compression shorts I have ever found for the money. They arrived within three days of my order on regular delivery. This is my second purchase from Saf-T-gard and I will definitely look here first in the future.
4,Works for running!,"I tried this product because it is much cheaper than the Under Armour equivalent. I am a runner who wants to prevent chafing of the thighs and groin. To my surprise, these actually do the job. I like that they are more lightweight than Under Armour compression shorts. These don't provide much compression, but that's not what I was looking for. I still apply Vaseline down there before every run, especially the longer runs. These work for me during hot and cold weather."
4,"Old School Martial Artist, Trying to Stay Ahead of The Youngster's!",Thanks for the quick delivery! Just what I needed for martials training. Gave 4 star's because they are not quite as good as my Under Armour compression shorts. But they get the job done.
3,Functional but not very comfortable,"These shorts are great, but the material is a little thick and ""rough"" feeling. I'm used to a thinner, softer material. They function perfectly, and perhaps they will soften with wash & wear."
1,You get what you pay for,"Bought two pairs of these and am very disappointed with them. While they did perform their intended function for me of preventing chafing in the thighs, the waist band is so stiff and iritating as to render them unwearable. I had a pait of underarmor shorts that not only performed but were also extremely comfortable. I will not be purchasing anything by this manufacturer again and will instead spend the money to get a quality product."
1,Garbage,"Ordered these on 4/22/08 and they have holes in each side of the crotch stichings as of 7/20/08. I am not a huge runner either, maybe 5 miles a week at max. I bought a pair if Nike compression shorts and they lasted like a year, and I was running a lot more with the Nike shorts.....These are pure garbage."
2,Too Short Shorts,"They must have really short models in their photo. I just received the pair (womens, black) which I ordered. I wanted knee length, as is shown in the photos. These shorts are about 4"" too short. The material feels nice, but there is little compression. The sizes run large. I ordered my normal size. I should have ordered 1 or 2 sizes smaller. I ended up buying under armour capri length - as they are longer and have more compression."
1,Not happy with compreesion short,This compression short did not fit good at all i will not be ordering anything from this company anymore
5,Very good quality,This item was much better quality than expected glad I bought two. Is much better quality than similar items from Walmart or Kmart.
2,Big Seams,"These shorts worked okay for what I bought them for; however, the seams are large and uncomfortable. I wore them inside out and they were fine. That's what I get for being cheap."
4,Pro/Excellent,great book...it helped me out in Mechanical Engineering classes at the University of Texas at Austin
3,Horribly fun!,Never judge a DVD by it cover. I thought that this was going to be a Zombie movie...It had nothing to do with Zombies (although the people who are taken over by the spirit of the dead toddler moved sort of like a zombie). A toddler was killed by a self inflicted gun shot wound to the head. He then proceeds to posses the people closest to those who have done him wrong in order to kill them. All and all a warm tale about a kid who wants to be with his mommy.
1,Horror movie fan review,Absolutely terrible movie. Watched almost the entire movie in fast forward. Movie is slow and pointless. Dont waste your time with this one.
1,Garbage!,"No zombies, false cover art! What a f'n rip-off. That makes me so mad. I wanted a zombie movie and got a STUPID movie about a baby that comes back to life and posesses other people to try to kill the Mom who gave him up for adoption. Oh...and if that's not stupid enough, here's a SICK A** twist. The birth Mother has sex with a ""host"" who is currently posessed by her toddler son, GROSS! LAME LAME LAME!!!"
1,rise of the dead,It sucked! The entire thing just sucked! I would never give away the movie but there were not even zombies in the movie.
3,Non-schlock slasher film,"My expectations for this movie were pretty low, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I don't particularly like schlock horror movies; but this was filmed in my hometown. Although I liked the Crook Brothers' other horror movie, I enjoyed this one much more. The acting was better, and I thought it was overall more seamless. How many low budget horror movies have (quasi) logical plots and good acting? True, it should be classified as a slasher and not zombie movie; but if you're really sensitive about that, get over yourself; it was bought it in a zombie package. Given the budget and genre, this was an impressive little movie. Unfortunately, the working title,'Tantrum', didn't stick. 'Tantrum' as a title, a better synopsis, and different classification would do better to further the surprising little experience that was this movie."
1,they were the ones that lied...,"no one ""assumed"" it was a zombie film because of the title. the description on the back of the dvd says it plain and clear thats its a zombie movie, but it isnt, they lied. this movie sucks, and the maker of this dvd is a D*ck for lying to everyone by slapping the world zombie on the box"
1,"zombies, i think not.","this film is a slsher. not a zombie film. the killers arent even living dead, just crazy people. i give it half a star but amazon wont let me. horrible film."
4,Packs a Powerful Punch,"Much of George Foreman's life has been a fight. From his troubled childhood, he had to keep jabbing away at resilient opponents like racism and poverty. Still, he never threw in the towel. In stead every time life knocked him down, he got back up and came out swinging. At times, his religious prostelyzing seems a little ironic considering, his first four children were fathered by four different women, but many others have seen the light after years of dubious behavior. The final rounds are often more important than the first few. Boxing fans will be thrilled by the details of his glory years and his unbelievable comeback when he regularly faced fighters young enough to be his sons. The book may not score a knockout, but it definitely wins by a unanimous decision."
4,You Gotta Love Him,Love biographies of real people in the world today that are honest and this one really is - George takes us into his whacky and fun world and where he's been and why ... you may not agree with him but you gotta love him. We'd all benefit by being more like George
5,Fabulous Faux Pas!!!!!,"I had never heard of Etta Jones until this magical discovery! I even listened to the cd in the store but I only read ETTA JAMES on the cover and that was the voice I heard. I have made a fabulous new friend, ""Ms Etta Jones""!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not dark enough,"Ordered it thinking it would match ACU digital uniform which has much darker camouflage. But the cover turned out to be much lighter in color and doesn't match any uniforms I know of. Cover however, is well made and has good internal support."
5,Well written and detailed to boot!,"Keith has done it again with this book its a great read for both beginners and experienced martial artists alike. The book is written in nice short sections with useful illustrations to guide you through the techniques and teaches you a load of skills that will not only help your locks, but help your martial arts in general.I'd definately recommend Keith's wrist lock book (or any of his books for that matter) to any martial artist whether they are just starting out like me or have a few years (or styles!) under their belt. Top notch!"
4,Almost perfect,"Frank Taylor ""FT56"" probably has not read the book . Please ignore him . Keith Pascal writing is clear, easy to read , the book is very good . I rated ""4"" because the pictures are not so good . It would be great have real photos or even a movie on a cd rom version but just better drawings would be enough to rate it at ""5"" ."
3,Decent.,"It was a decent book, but there are others better I believe in the chin -na instructional books. Chin Na in my opinion is the absolute best when it comes to the joint-locking arts."
1,COULD NOT BE MORE HORRIBLE,"What a scam. I am convinced those who rated this outdated and useless book highly were paid endorsements. In a street fight, if you honestly believe you are going to get someone, swinging at you like a Mike Tyson, in a wrist lock you should be beaten to an inch of your life. Maybe only then will you see the lunacy of your thinking. Don't get me wrong. Wrist locks have a place for police officers who arrest drunken miscreants who fully comply. But this book is rediculous. The pictures are old and gritty, unclear, vague, and really, how much can you learn this subtle art from a book? If you think you can, I have a book I'd like to sell you on teaching you how to fly a 747 jet airliner. All you do is read the book and you are ready to fly the jet--the same day. I hate scam artists and this is yet another one who is trying to use fear to sell smake oil."
1,Very Disappointing,"For the price of this book and the promises made by the author, I came away with the thought that the he was simply rehashing the same old material that can be found in just about every martial arts book. I was expecting so much more and do not recommend this book at all.There's nothing new or exciting in this book - save your money on this one!"
4,Bernstein's Humanity shines,In this video you will become acquinted with one of the most notorius musical personalities of our time. Seeing what is behind the musical performance shows his real talent. It is clear his intentions were to express musical thought without pretentions. In this video you will see clearly why he drew huge masses of people to hear his concerts.
5,Ministry Education and Training,"This book is a must for anyone wanting to minister to the sick in the name of Jesus.It outlines fundamental principles for faith, for taking authority over sin and sickness, and for ministering in the apostolic way as prescribed in the Book of Acts and in the Epistle of James."
3,By his stripes we are healed,"This book is wonderful,it covers all various kinds of sickness and talks about demons possession.Behind every kind of disease is an evil spirits.It satan working in your life.He can get in many ways, generational sin something your ancestors did that passed down to you or willful sins, sometimes satan will trick you into doing something.CAST DEMONS OUT CLEAN YOUR TEMPLE AND CLOSE THE DOOR.FORGIVE ALL THOES WHO HAVE SINNED AGAINST YOU."
5,A must read for those that question divine healing.,"This book helps one to understand the gift of healing that God has provided to all that seek it. An excellent book for skeptics, believers and those who are not sure that it is Gods will for all to be healed."
4,FANTASTIC,"I am an avid fan of crime story related books, this one rates up there with the best of them. The authors ability to set up a crime, from the background, to the crime itself and then to the afterfall is fantastic. I enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it in a heartbeat."
4,introducing Arabic to youngsters,"This is a book for a young learner of Arabic. The book is written and bound so that it is read in reverse order, just like authentic Arabic publications. Each page is devoted to a different letter of the (Arabic) alphabet. The text contains the Arabic name for each image, written in Arabic script, in addition to the English translation and a phonetic guide to pronunciation. The book is well presented with beautiful watercolour illustrations.It would appear that it is intended for an English-speaking child who is learning Arabic. While it would seem to have most relevance in a setting where a child is being taught Arabic, it also serves as a brief introduction to the sounds and script of this language to any child with an interest in exploring different cultures."
2,Might be a waste of time.............,"This book is a collection of recipes for vegetarian dishes that can accompany your juices. So far as I can see, it offers NO meat recipes at all. If you're not a dyed in the wool health food freak this may not appeal to you. You are fore-warned."
1,The Joy of Juicing Recipe Guide,This was a used book stated to be in very good condition. Pages contained food spills and splashes. General condition was actually fair.
4,Twice as Good by Alison Roberts (Mills & Boon Hardcover),"Review for ISBN 0263166325, the regular print hardcover edition from Harlequin Mills & Boon.Description from the book back cover:Practice Nurse Janet Muir had made a good new life for herself and her twin sons at St. David's Practice. She had left her feelings for the boys' father, Dr. James McFadden, far behind ... So it was a tremendous shock when Jamie suddenly turned up to work at St. David's! How could she tell him about the twins when Jamie made it so clear that he considered Janet responsible for their break-up?"
4,Strong ending for a great trilogy,"Read ""The Demons at Rainbow Bridge"" and ""The Run to Chaos Keep"" first, or you won't understand what is going on.The true threat and power of the Quintara are revealed, and the remnants of the teams running the Marathon must fight the devils or join them.Chalker kept me turning pages constantly by throwing plot curveballs. If you as a reader feel weird about some of the revelations, you really identify with the characters who agree with you. Rarely I have identified as much with characters inside a science fiction novel.Chalker spins religion into sci-fi in a way that suprised me. I hate being general, but I hate spoilers more. Unless you as a person are religiously intolerant, you'll like this book. You might even smile and say 'Wow!' at the ending, like I did."
3,"Go Nikki, Go!","Este comentario lo haré para personas que hablen o entiendan español.Desde que vi Hairspray y conocí a Nikki Blonsky me encanto. Poco después me enteré que hizo otra película para TV, Queen Sized.Después de un tiempo, pude verla y me encanto. Ver a Nikki en otra faceta es interesante y el hecho de interpretar a un personaje que esta acomplejada por su físico y que por azares del destino llega a ser popular con el apoyo de sus amigos, lo hace interesante.Queen Sized es recomendable para toda la familia, con un gran mensaje.Nos vemos."
5,QUEEN SIZED movie for TV,This movie is a good family movie with a message. Nikki Blonsky did an excellent job and Annie Potts was spectacular!
4,"not as good as the first novels, but very entertaining","The premise is that mythology and great works of fiction are really discriptions of alternate universes. The hero of a series of books by Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague DeCamp learns how to travel to the alternate universes. The Wall of Serpents is set in the world of Irish myth. The authors are great story-tellers and this series works very well. The sword fights, battles of magic, and battles of wit are all delightful. The reader will find this book more enjoyable if it is read after The Compleat Enchanter."
3,Good desk... but,"The desk came early but damaged. There was a 1' chip out of the top and one of the wire trays was broken. Not the desk's fault. But, I did have to drill a cam hole on one of the legs that was missing. I did not want to mess with sending a desk back that was over a 100lbs. The desk is sturdy and fits nice in the corner of my office."
5,Pretty Good Show Lead,"I have used this for my now 10.5 month old cavalier king charles spaniel and I can say that she is very comfortable with how the lead is in on her neck and its still strong enough to send her a signal.It is pretty stiff at first, so try to break it in before using it in the show.I think about 2-4 practice rounds broke the lead in, so it became a lot more softer."
1,Definitely not worth whatever they're charging for it,"I was so hugely disappointed in this book i can barely describe it. This was by far one of the worst written and most poorly edited books I have ever read. Bamberger really takes it over the top trying to intellectualize Beefheart's music & paintings. Leaving the reader to say ""who cares?"". It really just ends up taking away from how great his music & art really is. Left me with a bad taste in my mouth...Definitely not worth the high price."
4,Both sides of Captain Beefheart arts,"Very interesting 200 pages book that explores both sides of Captain Beefheart arts :music and painting.It analyses his ecological view ofinterconnection of all things that will disappear with his 1986painting ""Riding some kind of unusual skull sleigh "" which is the lastpainting to include a human figure.Recommended"
3,Great printer for the money,This is a great printer for the number of features for the money. I only wish it could scan to email instead of requiring that you use their Epson scan application. Push scan only works for a small number of licenses that they send with the unit. Most smaller printers now days support wireless directly and also scan to email without any additional software required so it is a bummer that this unit can't do it.I did have 2 more of these but both required fuser replacement after about 1 year which were too expensive relative to replacement cost so we opted to replace the printers instead.
1,printer WILL NOT OPERATE WITHOUT $250 REPLACEMENT PHOTOCONDUCTOR!,"printer WILL NOT OPERATE WITHOUT $250 REPLACEMENT PHOTOCONDUCTOR!and have fun trying to buy the photoconductor locally, because it's not sold anywhere in the greater Phoenix AZ area. basically, this printer has become the elephant in the room in my office. it's just taking up space and collecting dust!"
4,Excellent (if you can set it up...),"I have owned this printer for over a year, and it has definitely been the best printer I have ever owned. 2 Macs and 1 PC, all interface seamlessly through a Linksys wireless router. BEAUTIFUL color prints, excellent black text (don't believe CNET!). I got this at Costco for about $550 after trying all of the other (cheaper) all-in-one lasers they had. Yes, it is expensive, but for the quality you get, I consider it a BARGAIN.Now, the downside -- it took me a FULL DAY to set this machine up and get it working properly. And Epson customer support is a JOKE -- they go through the usual ""solutions"" that any experienced user would just laugh at, and they they practically read from the troubleshooting section of the manual. So, if you know a thing or two about networking, you should be able to get it set up. Otherwise, you may be out of luck.Overall, if you can get it working, you will not be sorry with the result!"
3,A good 4-in1 solution with some bugs in it,"I use this for a small law office, its print quality and speed are quite good, though black and white text is slightly thin and the colors can band a little on some jobs, HP might be slightly better, though print quality is strong all around. Fax and scanning work well. It is a bit noisy, and its easy to spill toner when installing, which is then pretty tough to clean. It has the shortest physical depth of all the printers in its class, so if you have little counter space, its a good choice."
1,"What a (heavy) Piece of Junk - But, Amazon GREAT on Return","You need a forklift (or the entire family) to even lift it. After 2 hours of install effort (including time on the phone with worthless customer service). I declared it Dead on Arival. I even called for Epson on-site service-- which is a bigger joke than their tech support.Then, common sense prevailed (my wife), and I called Amazon to return it. A+++ for Amazon on the return. They sent UPS to my house, paid for return shipping and promptly credited my account for the entire amount.I bought a Xerox and I am very happy.Short version:Epson : FAmazon: A+"
3,What the Bible Teaches,"I was very excited to see 'What the Bible Teaches' for my Android phone. Yeah! However, it does not list 'Table of Contents'...it grayed out. It would be nice to have a table of contents available or ability to make notes or mark page by 'Row'. It's difficult to locate where chapters/topics start and end since there's no 'find on page option'."
5,A Terrfic Useful Book,"I just loved this book. I've been a bridesmaid so many times and have had to make toasts and say ""a few words"" on many occasions. I just wish I had had this book ten years ago. Some of the toasts actually brought tears to my eyes. It's truly a reference book that's written with heart, passion, and humor. I recommend it to anyone who needs to come up with a meaningful speech for anniversaries, weddings, any emotion-filled life event."
2,Save your money...,There is nothing in this book you cannot find online for free. It is boring and unoriginal. I was very disappointed. My daughter is getting married and I was hoping for some help. It was not to be found in this book.
5,Excellent book!,We would have so much better results in our classrooms today if the principles and character found in these stories were still applied as a whole in our society.
2,the product is ok but we ordered 3 covers at #2.97 and 3 covers at $4.97 and we received 6 of the cheaper covers,We ordered 3 covers at $2.97 and 3 covers at $4.97. We received 6 of the cheaper covers and none of the more expensive covers but were charged for the more expensivecovers
1,Save your money,Save your money and purchase a better product. After only 4 months it ripped even without stress. I had one similar to this that lasted several years but it was a thicker plastic.
1,paper thin dust covers,"I loved the idea of being able to see my beautiful cushions through the plastic. I was disappointed when I opened these a few weeks after buying them. Some tore right away. They do cover your chairs, but are quickly blown away if you have any type of wind. The rain accumulates in little puddles and breaks through, soaking your cushions on the parts that stay covered. They are a very thin plastic that would be great as a dust cover only. I tried to get a refund and was quickly denied. I shouldn't have wasted my money. Hope this helps in your decision."
4,Plastic patio chair covers,"Plastic thickness it's very thin, but it does the job to keep chairs clean / dust free. For the price you can't go wrong."
5,Good product,The covers are lightweight yet sturdy. The elastic at the bottom is ingenious for keeping them in place. Can't beat the price!
3,"First time great buy...second time, not so great","2009: I live in Florida, so anything left outside gets covered in sand and mildew. These chair covers are tough and durable and wash up easily with a little bleach and dishsoap. I have cats, so they may have a couple of claw holes in them, but they still do the job. I would purchase these again.Update: I ordered these again (in 2012), but instead of the tough durable covers I bought in 2009, I got very thin plastic covers that remind me of cheap shower caps. For the price, I guess it is what I should have expected the first time, so I consider myself lucky the first order lasted three years.I may order these again if I can't find any others close to this price."
3,Decent but doesn't last long,"Covers worked well but did not last long. It was probably less than 2 seasons of covering before the cover cracked and broke after becoming brittle from exposure to the elements. This is also in northern California, where the weather isn't even all that extreme. I'm guessing they would disintegrate sooner in the extremes of the midwest with humidity, high heat, and extreme cold."
1,The material tears,Did not last me even six months. I don't live in a stormy place but the vinyl has torn and I have thrown both covers away.
2,CHAIR COVERS,THE PLASTIC WAS VERY THIN BUT THEY DID NOT COST MUCH SO I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE FINE. I WENT OUT SIDE AND TO MY SURPRISE THE PLASTIC WAS TEARING ALL OVER. DID NOT LAST VERY LONG. THEY WERE CHEAP BUT THOUGHT THEY WOULD LAST LONGER. NOT WORTH IT.
4,Good Range of Embroidery Stitches,"There is a lot of overlap between this book and Snook's Embroidery Stitches, but there is a lot that is original as well. Needlework stitches from embroidery to canvas work to counted work are grouped and pictured. Line drawings of the stitches are accompanied by minimal explanation so this is suggested for the needleworker who has some experience. Interesting stitches, but some of them are covered in better detail in other works. A solid four star work but nothing exceptional."
4,very sturdy,"While there are many cheaper similar products out there, they are not nearly as sturdy or clean looking. The sweater shelves do not sag at all (and the shoes shelves only slightly along the middle). Plus it is very convenient and I have used to hold the recommended items as well as purses and other accessories."
5,Great for smaller ladies shoes,I had ordered this along with the mens shoe hanger. I keep all my smaller shoes in this. All in all the product is great for the price u pay. But for bigger/mens shoes u need a men's hanger. I checked out the price too for similar products and this has a good price too.
4,Good product! Helps me store my lesser used clothing items.,"I wasn't sure how well this hanging sweater/shoe bag would work, but so far it's getting a lot of us, and it looks nice in the closet, too. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get some lesser used items off the floor/out of the way."
3,Not sturdy even for kid's shoes and clothes.,"I purchased this after reading all the good reviews. Unfortunately, these shelves are quite dissapointing. After just having a few kids sweaters and shoes in these shelves for a while, they started to loose shape. The top is arched and the whole thing looks pretty bad. I've found a similar shelves, but in nylon at local dollar store for $5 and they look much sturdier. I'm going to get more of those for my home."
3,Adequate Shoe Bag,The only problem I have with this is that the smaller cubbies are too small. I have trouble getting a pair of shoes in them. Other than that it is a sturdy great shoe Hanger.
5,You'll want more,It's perfect. Instead of sweaters though I put my shoes where they belong and my purses on the open spots. It's great. I am going to order more. This one is in my hall closet. You don't have to use it for just shoes and sweaters. You can use if for little things that need somewhere to go and to be out of the way. I have one that I use for sewing stuff since I don't have a little sewing desk. I highly recommend it .
5,Tom Of Finland: The Art Of Pleasure,"Tom Of Finland, a name that changed the self-image of almost all gay men from the late 1940s to the present day.This book is not just pornography, it is a wake up call of gay awareness. Large, thick and hot, this book has many examples of Tom's artistic and sexual contribution on a large coffee table format and high quality paper.It's both thought provoking and erotic. It transformed the effeminate gay self image with one that is all man, and very masculine. It is nothing less than an icon."
3,"awesome, but use better paper","I hunted for this book when it was sold out everywhere, finally found a copy and was disappointed. The content of the book was awesome, but the pulpy paper it was printed on was a letdown. I never did buy it for that very reason."
2,the gay Peter Max,"nice editon, but TOm really never develops his style after 1960.it is just one identical body after the other. There is no character to these bodies, either humanly or artistically. Pin-ups, that all."
4,Message of Jesus Christ,"I knew the book very well before I bought it and was very impressed by Ganhdi's philosophy.I was pleasantly surprised by the good condition of the ""copy"" that I received because the previous copies I had to use were out of print and had poor bindungs. This was an up-to-date recopy, very readable and clear.The dealer I received it from was very prompt and agood business person.I am very pleased overall and would use this service again."
3,"""Spanish 3 Students Have a Hard Time Comprehending""","I have been teaching with this book now for many years, and I have finally come to the comclusion that my students are having too much trouble understanding what this book is trying to teach us. The lessons are fairly organized, but here could be a considerable amount of revising to be done before more students use it . Take for example ""Dime Algo"" and ""Dime Mas"" these, two books I have previewed and havef ound them to be excellent, not only do they show the time and effort put in, it is very logically organized. The lessons and all are very clearly explained. Unfortunately ""Pasos y Puentes"" does not lllive up to these and other expectations of myself, the students, and the foreign language department."
1,I found it to be an illogically organized second year text!,"The grammer lessons in this second year spanish book lack the needed structure that is prudent for a high-school text book to have. The vocabulary is lacking and what of it there is, is extremly poor. I would not recommend this book to any high-school looking to buy a second year spanish text book."
2,Flash Gordon,"I was disappointed to see that the TV series of Flash Gordon was included. The movies are not clear nor is the sound. We enjoyed the original movie series but the TV series, we feel, should not have been included."
4,Important reading for corporate strategic planners.,"Although I'm no longer completely convinced that the ""core competencies"" approach is always the right approach to stategic planning, Hamel and Prahalad's work is important reading. Every organization should understand its core competencies and take them into account in their strategic planning process. Having said that, however, I personally prefer the ""Key Strategic Driver"" concept laid out by Mike Robert in his book ""Strategy Pure and Simple"". When working with my clients on strategic planning activities, we often discuss core competencies as a prelude to exploring the company's ""driving force"" or ""strategic heartbeat"". Adam Lefton"
2,Did the authors check their facts?,"One example from this book. I heard about the Five Monkeys experiment in grad school - not as a study but as an urban legend.The authors of this book say they heard about the study from someone but they never cite the study. No names, places or dates are given for the study or even who they heard it from.People still use the Five Monkeys experiment in presentations and company training. There are even animated videos circulating, but no facts about The Five Monkeys experiment exist. Don't take my word for it, go online and try to find the original study or write to an animal behaviorist and ask him if the experiment as described in this book ever happened.A lot of people still believe that the Five Monkeys experiment is true. It is still being discussed on blogs and urban legend forums.If we really want to compete for the future we need to at least check our facts better than this."
2,Hyped Up,The reality of the modern world is too different from the scenarios painted in this book. Utter waste of time
4,Nitrate filters,"I am currently using this product in three low flow canister filters I built using RO canisters and air tubing. I have seen a reduction in nitrates coming out of the filter but since you have to use a slow flow rate, I have seen only a little reduction in the tanks. I am sure I will see a significant reduction after the filter has had time to filter the entire tank. I read that this product will also support denitrifying bacteria so I should not have to replace the media.I like what I see so far. Good stuff."
5,effective,"I'm using the Denitrate in two box filters in a 29 gallon. I've had it in for 2 months and so far ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates have remained at safe levels."
2,No Effect on my Nitrates,"I really liked the idea of this product and added it to my canister filter. Sadly, over the course of several months, it had no effect on my system. It *might* have slowed the rise of nitrates, but there is no way to know for sure."
3,Hacking for Dummies,"When the book came it was very musty smelling, like from a smoker. However, it was definitely what my son wanted and he was happy."
4,hacking for dummies,Great book. Be very careful with the software links however. Many will damage your computer or network. Learn how to defend your computer without downloading hazardous programs. Steve
2,Its a good book for people with no common sense at all,I think all the Dummies books are good specially for the people who are dummy in the field and dummy in life as well. By dummy in life I mean they cant even use their common sense for thing. For example Although it did gave some good hacking sites but then it took so many pages explaining that you can also hack by looking over the shoulder of a person who is entering his userid/pwd I would call it DUHHHH!!.
5,"Great book, a MUST buy!","I love this book! I use this in conjunction with Chinese in a Flash and it makes learning the characters so much easier.The book is phenomenal because it is set up to teach you how to use a traditional Chinese dictionary and shows you how to write the character and even gives you some hints on learning them. It discusses radicals, meaning and idioms! I HIGHLY urge you to read the Student Guide in the book before using it.Overall, it's worth purchasing and I will forever go back to it to practice my writing and brush up on meanings."
3,Just okay,"This book is okay and it is actually very similar to one of Rita Choy's books,however I feel that Rita Choy's book is much better organized and has more information.See ""Read and Write Chinese: A Simplified Guide to the Chinese Characters""by Rita Mei-Wah Choy"
4,Pretty good... but has at least one error...,"I think someone else already stated that there were ""many"" errors... I haven't been learning chinese too long... and don't know many characters... but I found one at least... the book uses ' in character #290... for ""Enough""... when traditional is actually '... basically the same character reversed. I just luckily found this.Again... a book with over 2000 characters is bound to have a few errors. It'd be neat if there was a web-based version of this that could be edited like a wiki. Then these mistakes could be found and fixed."
5,Useful but index needs a good proofreader.,"This is a very helpful, easy-to-use book for beginners. It has a lot of the characters you come across at first. What I can't find here the What Character Is That? is a good supplement for. The one caveat is that for the Additional Characters section, a good part of the book, the index is riddled with mistakes. I hope they come out with a new edition and correct this very frustrating flaw. But still, this is the book I refer to first and mostly."
5,"Second Reading&Writing book, not disappointed.","First of all, let me clarify this book's intent: IT IS A STUDY AID. It will not teach you Chinese characters on its own. With that said, this is my second Reading & Writing book, and both have proven some of the strongest and best foreign language aids I've owned in my lifetime. I cannot recommend these books enough. The writers know their content, and deliver in a concise, easy-to-study format."
2,BEWARE - NOT AN INSTRUCTION BOOK,"This book is akin to a dictionary. It is NOT an instructional book. From reading the other amazon comments, I was under the impression that I could learn chinese from self-study of this book. This is not the case. Much like a dictionary, it lists the character followed by the meaning and stroke order, and that's it. One could perhaps use this book as a companion dictionary, but I recommend Rick Harbaugh's ""Chinese Characters: A Genealogy and Dictionary"" for that purpose. In short, this books is not a instruction book, and as a dictionary, it is too short. It is only good at showing you the stroke order of characters."
2,not a fan,"as an advanced chinese student I dont like this thing. i cant articulate why, but it isnt cool. I like ""Chinese ABC computerized"" much better."
3,Frustrating errors in edition I have been using,"This book is a compact and useful guide to writing characters. However, its pronunciation guide is frequently wrong!!! (And there may be errors in the stroke counts as well, I'm not sure if my own methodology is to blame here, but .. . .) This is very frustrating. It uses Yale romanticization unlike the standard hanyu pinyin or the far more useful mandarin phonetic symbols--buh puh muh fuh. I thought it was great until I tried to cross-reference it with my dictionaries. I wasted a few hours looking for a character in one of my dictionaries. Finally, I looked through the pinyin index of Richard Harbaugh's excellent and wonderfully eccentric dictionary, which can be accessed online at zhongwen.com and is sold here as well, ah eureka, but at what cost of wasted time? Bottom line: use with care."
3,"good for reference, not really for learning","I bought this book because it had alot of basic characters (2000) and presented in TRADITIONAL form, which I find easier to understand and remember. Each ""basic"" character has pinyin, stroke order, short definition, and sometimes examples of use. It's not meant to teach you as a workbook would. I would buy it if you want a reference book to learn stroke orders and the associated pinyin."
4,What a shame,"Excellent work by The Poppy Family. They were on the threshold of real success, but their breakup finished that possibility. What a shame, as this collection shows their great potential. Definitely worth the investment."
4,TRULY UNDERATED POP,"You will not find the Poppy Family in any rock encyclopedia nor do they have their own web sight.What they do have is some of the best pop songs of all time(Where Evil Grows, Which Way You Going Billy?) This disc does an excellent job of collecting the Poppies best moments.""Good Friends"" is one of the greatest unheard classics of all time. Highly recommended."
5,Your collection isn't complete without this album,"I grew up listening to Susan Jack's beautiful voice from the time she sang in a church in Haney, British Columbia. Her vocals are incredible and the the Poppy Family sound will never be recreated. I would recommend this album to anyone, young and old. Just close your eyes and drift away."
3,Blast from the past.,Wanting to hear some old songs from my younger years and this CD brought those songs to me. I am happy to be able to get things I desire from Amazon! This purchase was well worth it!
2,"Eh, A little weak","I ordered this for training and pumpkin smashing and it worked quite well for about the first twenty minutes, then the blade started bend inside the hilt. As it turns out, the handle is just screwed on and the blade turns into a really cheep steel rod that is easily bent and broken. Also, the screw can be stripped super easily. This is great to hang as an ornament but I would not recommend for any real fun stuff unless you don't care if it breaks."
1,The fan broke within 6 months..,"This dual fan, unlike others, did not have a switch to reverse the airflow. This would have been more convenient than having to turn the unit around if I wanted to change the inflow/outflow. It did however work fine in terms of enough power for my room (12x12). The problem was, one of the blades eventually came loose and fell off it's support. I was able to put it back on but it was a recurring problem and eventually that blade bent and was useless. If I had to do it all again, I would have bought a heavier duty fan."
5,I love Italian Movies!,"Having enjoyed many Fellini movies this music brings back many good memories. Nino Rota music is fun, romantic and has many moods. I'm really enjoying it."
1,This is rated not a soundtrack,"If the music is not from the film then how is it a soundtrack?Amazon has some problems and this is one, I in general trust Amazon but how I to trust ""soundtrack"" labeled music that is not from the movie?"
4,The Battle of Platea comes alive in a readble and enjoyable way.,"I really enjoyed this read. This book packed in tremendous amounts of history, yet remained fun to read. As one reviewer says it took a bit to get started, but the build up was necessary to fully engage the characters. Some one unfamiliar with the battle of Platea would need those initial chapters. The characters are alive and fresh whether made up or historical. I would highly recommend this book and looking forward to reading Jon Martin's second novel (which I have ordered). This is a must read for fans of historical fiction, especially those that enjoy ancient Greece. Some may ask, why didn't you give it 5 stars if you liked it so much? Well I found several editing errors in the book, which once you re-read the paragraph you could figure out what was going on, but the fact that I had to stop and ask, ""What just happened? Did the Character talking switch?"" makes me unhappy. I expect the editors to do their job."
4,"Slow Start, but worth it","In Kithairon's Shadow, follows in the same mold as Stephen Pressfield, author of Gates of Fire and Tides of War. The novel starts off slowly but eventually captures the reader's interest through its characters. At times the vocabulary is a bit heavy, and the author assumes that the reader has a some knowledge of the historical environment. Nonetheless, as someone who studied the time period, I enjoyed the book immensely and was enthralled as the battle of platea came to life for me. I would definitely recommend this novel to anyone with an interest in classical history. It is an extremely satisfying read for someone with a knowledge of the time period, as Mr. Martin did an excellent job of researching the subject."
2,Herodotus was more exciting,"Well, sometimes the history books are better. This book was slow paced, the characters were underdeveloped and the action was not that gripping. The battle of Plataea was a momentous and significant event. It was the culmination of a dramatic stand against an overwhelming force from a foreign land. The subject matter should have been handled with a more dramatic approach. Instead, I was left not caring who lived or died. This is an uninspiring tale about a very important time. The author obviously knows his history but should leave the historians to tell it."
3,Good for the beginner,"Good for the beginner, and since I am a beginner I guess it was good for me. However, I was hoping for something that got more into the guts and less into the application."
2,Teach Yourself Visually Mac OS X Tiger,I wasn't really thrilled with the graphics and layout of this book. It is supposed to be visually pleasing and helpful for learning and I found it confusing and all over the page. There needs to be more of a balance of graphics and text and they need to interact more with each other in a visually appealing way.
2,not very good,i like it at first - it looks good! then i realized it has SO LITTLE INFORMATION! it is simply an overview. i see amazons selling it at almost half the price i paid a month ago. it's barely worth that! go for a more thorough book.
4,Teach Visual,Pictures help. Often I find what I need to know in this book that some times is not covered in other books
3,Not bad !,"I found the Last drag to be a nice CD but not a great CD. I listened to it, but it didn't grab me as advertized in some of the other reveiws. I have to give it a few more whirls on my player but I don't anticipate much excitement from that experience."
5,Sick Cd,"The Last Drag was my first Samples album, and since then I have purchased many more and grown a great fondness for the band. The vocals and instrumentation are all too perfect. This is one of those cds that you can pop in and listen to all the way through. My favorites are ""Carry On"", ""The Last Drag"", ""Prophet of Doom"", and ""Every Time"". Check it out, you won't regret it."

3,Surprised that it was a used toy,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 2 year old son who has significant motor delays. He enjoys playing with it, and so does his one year old sister. When the toy arrived in the mail, I was surprised that it was a used toy. Maybe I missed this in the product description, and if so it's my fault. But I bought it with the expectation that it was going to be new, not used. Nonetheless, it was a good gift and it is played with often."
3,Pooh First Words,"Not sure how the ""First Words"" description made it into this toy. It plays songs and the animal buttons have corresponding sounds for dog, cat and chick but that's pretty much it. My daughter plays with it but it is not her favorite."
1,WHAT A MESS ON PRICING; TYPO ERROR RUINS PRICE,"All of Lisles creeper chair entries on Amazon are a mess, from the wheels which are falsely represented as chairs, to this train wreck of an ad which has added five hundred dollars to the correct price!"
4,Classic Jonathan Edwards,"Jonathan Edwards writings are far more comprehensive, and brilliant, than ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"". This is instructive and helpful for all Christians."
2,Simply not funny...,"I wasn't offended by this book and I'm not angry that it bashed Christianity or anything. I'm just disappointed. This book was not even the least bit funny. A freshman in High School could write funnier stuff than this. Seriously...I spent the whole book scratching my head and saying, ""he really thinks people are going to laugh at this stuff?"" It's horrible."
2,Don't quit your day job!,"Much of this book was witty, true, and included things that you wish someone had said but no one ever did. My problem was with the bathroom humor. When Carlin went off in this direction he was not funny, he was not even witty, he was generally just plain disgusting. I imagine that bathroom humor can be made to have some wit, but he missed it here. He is much more enjoyable to watch than he came across, on balance, in this book . . and he should stick to that . . George, don't quit your day job!"
2,Recommend Waiting for Better Things to Come...Hopefully,"Ouch! I HATE writing a bad review for George. I LOVE him. Have for many, many year. So it was with great optimism I picked up his latest book. I have to admit I didn't finish it. I couldn't. It just wasn't funny. And it wasn't enlightening. It was just confusing and boring. Sorry, George."
1,5 tons of Senility and Bitterness in one book!,"I have been a George Carlin fan for a long time, seen every one of his comedy specials, and read all of his books. While I will still give him a chance on the small screen, this book has confirmed something that I have feared: George has all but lost his mind! I read a grand total of twenty pages of this book, then realized that George has become too demented, too old and way too senile for me. This book is nothing more than the ramblings of a man who has all but lost touch with reality, and while he still can be a good comedian, this book did NOT help him in my book!"
1,just not that funny,"I bought this book because I used to think george carlin was pretty funny. Unfortunately, this book is mostly just angry and bitter and not really very funny, at all. Mr. Carlin repeatedly uses very harsh language for its shock value and it detracts from what he tries to say. He has some good points about euphemisms, about religion, about women's place in the world, but his presentation lacks finesse and is as subtle as a brick to the head and about as funny. Lest there be question -- I laugh at South Park, enjoy Michael Moore, and miss the days when it took more than repeated use of the word penis to be considered witty."
4,A nice words from a great man,You every wonder why you get up in the morning then you need this book because if you don't get it you will never find the answer to the ultimate question.
4,A very funny word-smith id George.,"I heard this book was banned at Wal-Mart, so I bought it for my Kindle that very same day. I figured it would be good and I was right. It's typical George Carlin with his wit and insight to our use of English throughout."
2,Just wasn't funny,"I am a huge George Carlin fan. I sometimes pull his first book, ""Braindroppings"" off the shelf for a quick cheer-me-up. Its a FUNNY book. The problem with 'When will Jesus..."" is its really not that funny. I felt like I was reading the rantings of a crotchety , bitter old man, without the usual Carlin finesse. ""THE FANATICS WILL WIN...anyone who supports the US will be killed.Save your money for the black market folks, you're going to need it"". Not funny. If I want to hear a crotchety old man, I'll call my father in Pittsburgh. I don't even care if Carlin messes with Jesus. I just wish he'd be funny while doing it."
2,Carlin past his prime,"I really enjoyed Carlin's previous books. They were for the most part sharp and profound. ""When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?"" is a real disappointment. George seems to have literally run out of ideas. His commentary seems forced and for what he lacks in humor he tries to make up with crudeness. I was bored. I'd save my money on this one. But if you haven't read his others...give them a try."
4,Have a Slice,"Carlin is like pizza. Even when it's bad, it's still pretty good. This book is not Carlin's best. But it's still pretty good. George Carlin is nearly always funny. Even when he's not funny, he gets you thinking. 'When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?' gets you thinking. It's not always funny, but it will put your brain to work. Sit down, make yourself comfy, and have a slice of George Carlin."
4,All these bad reviews prove one thing...........,"....good old George still hasn't lost his touch! In his beginning days George pissed off a lot of puritan and conservative wussies with his middle finger to PC brand of humor, and it seems he still does. As funny as ever.What's funnier are a lot of these christian goobers writing one star reviews are actually the work of one person. The person repeates how George is bad for not believing in some ancient Israelite hippie and more blah blah blahs. The person named themselves at one point ""Hurricane Weary"", so we can only guess they're some Jesus-loving hick from the Jesus-loving hick state of Florida! Wooooooooo weeeeeee southerners!"
4,"Not take thy lords name in Vain, read SB1 or God","The real theme of this book, yes it is right on target, but it is like the old cliche, some things are better left unsaid. People who say this is alright do not have any idea of Gods self respect and human respect for God. I do not disagree with George, but for reality sake, this is blasphemey at it height, but if you like bending the rules as God does not count slackness you will enjoy this slapstick humor, read SB 1 or God to extend Georges line of thought."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Apparently nothing is sacred to George Carlin. He's going to be more than red faced on Judgment Day when he stands before Jesus trying to explain how he got the title and cover picture for this book. Anyone who claims to be a Christian needs to boycott ""When Will Jesus Bring The Pork Chops?"". Better yet, watch the Passion of the Christ and then try to tell me that Jesus hasn't already suffered enough abuse. Just say no to George Carlin...don't buy this book."
1,Don't Bite The Hand That Feeds You,"George is going to find that his royalty checks for this book are on the light side because Christians are offended, so they aren't buying it. Take a stand for Christ."
1,AND THE JOKE IS ON CARLIN!,WHAT A DISASTER. I USED TO BE A HUGE CARLIN FAN BACK IN THE DAY OF CARLY SIMON.THIS BOOK JUST SEEMED LIKE A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO CREATE SOME CONTROVERSY (ESPECIALLY WITH IT'S LOADED TITLE).IT'S ALL JUST A LITTLE TOO OBVIOUS THAT WAS HIS INTENTION.
5,Why do the Christian's rage,"I have always been embarrassed for Christians and the people who believe in alien abductions. Good Christians are offended by this book. They are equally offended by the book, An Encounter with A Prophet by Clyde A. Lewis.Carlin and Lewis have both dared to attack the sacred cow of the Christian religion. Carlin uses humor Lewis uses simple but elegant logic. These men have offended many ""Good Christians"".All the righteous indignation over the use of some off color language in the attack of the sacred cow is coming from people who teach their own children that the Creator of this vast Universe loves them, but He will surely burn them in a lake of fire for the rest of eternity if they break the rules. This, to me. is the most humorous thing about all this controversy.You go George."
5,Not Particularly A Carlin Fan But Loved The Book!,"I am not any huge George Carlin fan but I stumbled upon the book so decided to buy it and read it. The title ""When will jesus Bring The Pork Chops?"" caught my eye because it was a little different and sacreligious. Although the book has very little to do with this title it is very amusing. Its not a biography, you won't learn much from it and it has little continuety, it is just observational humor at its finest. Some of the things Carlin writes about you just have to stop and wonder how he came up with it and why he was even thinking about it. I didnt take offense to anything in this book (even those things targeted at my religion, profession etc.) This is not a book to be taken seriously, just sit back, relax and enjoy this quick read."
1,Leave Jesus Out of It,"It seems that George Carlin doesn't care that many of his fans are Christian. He certainly has the right to the freedom of speech that was incidentally guaranteed by our Christian forefathers. Likewise, all Christians have the freedom to choose not to buy this book. Before George carelessly steps on millions of American toes, he should consider that he's likely to feel it where it hurts the most...in his wallet. Christians simply shouldn't buy this book."
1,Christians Unite,The majority of America professes to believe in God. Many Americans are Christians. Does it really make sense to pick on somebody's religious beliefs? Christians should stand up and let their voices be heard. The picture on the cover of this book is offensive to anyone who truly believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Refusing to buy this book will send a REAL message to George Carlin.
1,Noooooot Funny,"I thought this book was supposed to be funny, but I guess I was mistaken. From the sounds of it, if George had two positive thoughts in a row, his brain would have gone into a cramp. He would have us all believe that the entire world and everyone in it is a complete screw up. What you read affects your thoughts. Unless you need more negativity in your life or are hoping to bone up on your bad attitude, you can probably live without this book."
4,tickles the funny bone and nudges the mind,A very funny audio book that will have you laughing in no time. George Carlin does a great job in delivering the punch lines in this audio production of his latest book. There were parts I would listen at a public place and then just burst out laughing. He also divulges a bit of wisdom with his humour and one feels more enlightened. His one liners are the best and although a few parts are a bit boring or too long as a whole this book is quite funny. George Carlin is a man with a mission; his mission is to make you laugh and hopefully at times think a little out of the box. Highly recommended. This book contains five CDs and is narrated by the author. Piano snippets throughout enhance the listening experience and help to seperate parts.
3,Who's organizing the resistance?,"Am I the only one who finds it strange that so many of the 'one-star' reviewers have also offered rave reviews of the ""South Beach Diet."" What sort of screening process does Amazon use to keep people from gaming the review process?This isn't supposed to be philosophy but humor. Although they both share critical thought, one's supposed to be a little deeper than the other. If you take them both at face value or equate them then you're doing yourself a disservice. And even Jesus hated hypocrites, according to his press kit."
4,Honestly....,"This book isn't the best by Carlin, but as far as this reviewer is concerned, it's a 'worst of the best' situation. Carlin develops himself as a grumpy old man, disgruntled with religion and the oddities of society. Personally, this character is the reason I love Carlin's comedy and the reason that I found 'When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops' to be an excellent read. Granted, 'Braindroppings' and 'Napalm and Silly Putty' seem more original and more comedic than Carlin's most recent book, but that does not detract from the fact that independently 'When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops' is an engaging read that will thrust you into alternately unbridled laughter and serious contemplation."
3,Forced,Seems to be forced to fill pages. About 2/3'rds actually quite good but overall missed the point he was trying for. Certainly could have been better with several rewrites. Most of the stuff appropriate for standup but not adequate for written.
3,shut up!,"I will admit that this is definitely not Carlins best work. That being said... if you are a christian you should know right away that this book is not for you. The title is ""When will Jesus bring the porkchops?"". If you buy this book and you are a christian you are stupid because you knew you weren't going to like it before you bought it. To all the real Carlin fans: if I could go back in time I wouldn't have bought this. If i offended you because I said that... good because I didn't like you anyway."
2,"Half Good, Half Bad","I would say that half of this book is funny and entertaining and on target,(the parts about men, women, religion and retail), and the other half (burning cats, odes to Michael Jackson, crude bathroom humour)is just plain offensive and not funny at all. Carlin has some interesting insights on some subjects, but unless you're just crazy about him and really enjoy ""in your face"" type humour, the book is not that enjoyable."
1,When will Carlin bring the funny?,"Man oh man! I was so looking forward to reading this book and I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. If you read Braindroppings and/or Napalm and Silly Putty, you will get tired of this book really quick. Anything worth laughing about is merely a rehashing of the concepts introduced in the earlier books. As for new stuff, its as though he forgot he was a comedian. Not funny at all. I wasn't offended by anything he wrote. Well, except for the fact that I was offended he had the gall to charge money to read it.Definitely pass on this one."
1,Rehash of Old Material,I will admit up front that I could not get all the way through this book. This is a poorly done rehashing of old material mixed in with some boring new items. Check out the many older CDs available for really good Carlin material.
1,I love George but....,"This book was awful. I bought it with great anticipation of many joyful hours on the toilet. After all, what better place to enjoy toilet humor?Unfortunately the book was boring. What's more, Carlin does not resonate as the great sardonist and social critic he once was. He comes off as just another bitter old man.Here I sit brokenhearted...."
1,"Boring, Depressing and a Waste of Time",I listened to this directly after David Sedaris Live at Carnegie Hall (which was fantastic!) and boy was it painful and depressing. I kept skipping sections and waiting for it to get funny. George Carlin is just a grumpy old man who has lost his sense of what is funny. He is like the Andy Rooney of comedy!
2,The Title Is The Funniest Part Of The Book,I just could not get into this book. Maybe I'll try again in the future.Not what I epected from Carlin.
1,Awful...just Awful,"I read this waste of trees in a friend's bathroom (there was nothing else to read but shampoo bottles). Not a single laugh from beginning to end. What you get is crudeness and unfunny observations unbecoming of a man Carlin's age (which is what, 103)? Carlin may pretend to be a rebel and outside the mainstream, but he's really a ""bleeding ponytail,"" a millionaire who denounces the rich as if he were poor and trashes Whites and Christians, as do all of the politically-brainless liberal Hollywood-types who don't have the ba**s to tackle who the REAL screwups are. ZERO STARS."
2,Please explain,to me like a two year old what is the point of this book? It is a wastage of paper and ink and all the trees we have.
1,Anti-Christian Filth.....,"You took the 10 commandments out of the courtroom because it may offend someone, yet a book that offends millions of sincere christians is allowed to be sold in stores in America. This country definetly is going down but contrary to what this sad, sick man Carlin thinks; its because of people like him, who attack people because they have a religious faith. In America you have a choice to be religious or not, but you don't have a right to attack the faith of Christians. I took my copy right back to the target store manager and told him that this book should not be in the store but in the garbage."
1,INTOLERANT AND IGNORANT,"I AM GROWING WEARY OF PEOPLE BEING CRITICAL OF RELIGION WHEN THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO UNDERSTANDING OF IT. MOST OF THESE REVIEWS ARE TESTIMONY TO THAT. I DON'T MIND CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BUT THIS IS PEOPLE HIDING BEHIND THE ""HUMOUR"" LABEL AND POURING OUT DISRESPECTFUL AND VENOMOUS ATTACKS THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN RESEARCHED. BY THE WAY, THE BIBLE IS A BOOK OF FAITH, NOT HISTORY. I LIKED CARLIN'S EARLIER WORK AND CAN UNDERSTAND HIS FRUSTRATION WITH THE CATH CHURCH. GEORGE: COME BACK WE NEED YOU TO HELP NOT DESTROY !"
3,cutting-edge carlin,"Carlin's third book- not consistently funny as his first and second books. I like his randomness, but this one is too random. Some of the humour gets a bit disturbing, too. I think this should be Carlin's last book."
4,"Wit, Humor and Philosophy in One Book","Loads of good George Carlin bits, compiled so one can let the words and their meanings (as George meant them) soak in and play with your brain cells. His dislike of euphemistic or politically correct language is chronicled throughout, hitting its peak with the rant about the evolution of terminology from shell shock to post traumatic stress syndrome and how this has affected veterans' care for the same problem over the years. There are many more examples as well as George's expert twisting of words to mean what they say. Loads of laughs and lots to think about. Well worth the read."
4,"Carlin, When Will Jesus Bring The Pork Chops","When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops lives up to the title in that it's funny, ridiculous, and unexpected at times. Carlin's last book is a bit darker than his previous ones and also discusses a lot of things about language and how we use it incorrectly. Again, the book is random in its subject matter but if you know Carlin you can predict some of the things he will bash on. The title alone pokes fun at three separate religions. Take a break from thick novels about war, or thin, pointless novels written by an author who is only selling his name, and give George Carlin a try."
2,When will Jesus bring the pork chops?,"This book is an unworthy follower to Napalm and Silly Putty. Mr. Carlin rants about certain topics for way to long. Of course, there are funny bits, but I must say that the nagging overpowers the humor. We don't see the funny, witty Carlin here, but rather the old grumpy man who yells at little kids for playing in the street. Too bad..."
3,tired 'same old',"Some of this is clever. Some of it offends me, the way he seems to hate women and anyone who is not a WASJ male. The world need more blessings and fewer blind curses like this. This is a lashing out, based on ignorance. A mouth that roars--signfying nothing, if I can mix my citations.I do like what he says in other books about god as ""the old white guy in the sky"" that gets implanted in us early and then we spend the rest of our lives slavishly trying to please, groveling before this internal image."
2,Simply Boring.,"First off, let me say that I'm certainly not one of these ""right wing religious fanatics"", my opinion on religion is pretty much the same as George Carlin's. Also, he happens to be my all time favorite comedian.With that being said, I don't know what it is about this ... whatever it is ... spoken word album. As a whole, it falls flat. The vast majority of the material just isn't funny, or clever, but silly ... but not silly enough to be funny, just silly enough to be dumb.I'm giving this 2 stars since this is from George Carlin. It *should* be much better than this. At the end of the day, this is all simply boring."
2,"At best, keep it beside the commode !","I am a huge fan of Carlins but we've heard these in hisstand-up. The book is in my guest bath room, for thosewho like a book in the bog !The best part of this book is the title."
3,Classic Carlin - which means it's a repeat for people who know it well,"This book, like Carlin's previous two offerings, consists entirely of one-liners to two or three page long humorous anecdotes. Unfortunately, if you're familiar with Carlin's comedy albums, you'll be disappointed to find that many of the zany observations are just copied verbatim from his albums, occasionally with some elaboration or editing.Still, this book makes for a good bathroom book. Set it on the can and open it up to a random page, and by the time you're done you'll be chuckling, even if you've seen it before."
2,Random,"After listening to his great show ""You Are All Diseased"" I had high expectations of this book. Unfortunately, it never reaches the same level of hilarious outrage. Much of the book consists of a random assortment of observations, very few of them brilliant or laugh out loud funny. The only exception being a much more coherent part about euphemistic language, which is an ongoing thread in the book."
2,Wow! Caustic and embittered!,"I love George Carlin. That is what made this so sad to me. He's taken what was a razor sharp wit and intense study of the human nature and turned it into a condemnation of most of nature and a lashing, embittered rant. I didn't find it funny. I didn't sit back and think ""Well, the man has got a point."" I simply kept thinking ""He's seriously raging"".For political content, I much prefer Al Franken's books because he still holds a value for the humans around him."
1,Is anyone feeling suicidal yet?,"This book was soooooo pessimistic that it was actually depressing. For the reader's protection, they should sell the book with a double dose of Prozac taped to the inner cover. If a pessimist sees the glass as half empty, then Carlin must see the glass as absolutely bone dry. Anybody who has even briefly entertained a suicidal thought should probably get their affairs in order BEFORE they start reading this book."
1,not even so so,"Luckily in brick and mortar bookstores the customer has the opportunity to browse through the books he contemplates buying. So I looked at Pork Chops the other day. Now my background is that I consider George Carlin to be one of the greatest comic geniuses in the English speaking world. Seven words you can't say. An hour of free floating hatred. Etc etc etc. I was even one of those rare persons who loved _George_, his short-lived sitcom. I even continue to laugh about the episode that turned on the toxic effects of insufficient hair-washing.Unfortunately, this book was not funny. In vain, I searched through the pages to find something to make me laugh out loud, to guffaw, or maybe chuckle. Nothing. Not even a wry smirk. I hope his much-publicized time in detox brings him back to form. As for me, I satisfied my need for comic ranting with a Dennis Miller book."
1,Too Crude,"After reading this book it's easy to understand why Americans in general are becoming increasingly rude and inconsiderate. I still believe it's quite possible to be very funny without being crude and irreverant...but that requires a unique combination of cleverness and finesse. George seems more interested in thoughtlessly thumbing his nose at everyone and everything. If that makes your boat float, then you can have my copy of this book."
