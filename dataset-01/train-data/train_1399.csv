4,Shaves,Pros:- Holds a charge- Can be used in the shower (as far as I have used it lol)- No nips/cuts- Very close to the skin shaveCons:- Smells like oil for the first few shaves- Shaver heads are a bit hard to get on/off (one popped off on me mid-shave)
3,Defective Product,I have owned this same device in the pastI bought 2 one for myself and one for a giftThe One I kept is defective... the Blade has a big nick in itand it bits the skin...So 50 / 50 the one is fine the other is trash
1,Missing Items,"Hi everyone, I am very disappointed with the part missing in the shipment. Please be ensured while purchasing this trimmer from the buyer that all components mentioned are shipped. I didn't notice and had opened the package and found a part missing. I am still unable on how to use the trimmer. Terrible one I bought till date felt very bad because I lost my bucks for an useless thing."
2,Wahl Groomsman flaw,Just received the Groomsman for Christmas present and in removing from package I found the metal teeth in the middle were broken off. I owned a previous Wahl for years and stood by their quality...until now. Very disappointed in the quality Wahl's has now.
4,Works great.,Just got it about a week ago. Only used it once so far. I don't have any comnplaints other than it doesn't run on 220 which is all I get over her while I'm deployed.
3,"Was expecting bigger, stronger. Takes too long to shave!","I am used to trimmers that go through coarse beard hair like butter, but these take two or three times longer as I have to keep dragging them over the same areas. And yes they pull hairs. Battery lasts a long time, though. I was planning on returning them until I discovered how well they work on some other areas, the smaller teeth are not as menacing to delicate parts : )"
1,Not the Wahl you remember!,"This trimmer may have the Wahl name, but it's not in the same class as the classic Wahl trimmers and shavers of the past. The handheld unit is decent enough, but the attachments are terrible. They are a PITA to get on and off, making attachment changes very frustrating. They are also flimsy and break easily. I went back to my old Norelco trimmer, it does a better job trimming my beard."
2,Get what you pay for?,"Feels small in my hand and thus is hard to grip. On / Off switch feels cheap and weak. Very loud, sounds as if its about to break. The plastic ""six-position beard regulator"" came broken and falls off the trimmer. The other attachments, bag and stand are cheaply made and of throw away quality.Wish I had opened it and tried it in time to return it.I do not recommend!"
1,This was a horrible item,I tried trimming my beard and shaving my neck with this. I tried using this thing for about a month thinking it would eventually work well but it CONSTANTLY grabbed my hairs and pulled them rather than cutting them. It was actually pretty painful shaving with this thing. After about a month it pissed me off so much I ended up smashing it on my bathroom countertop... Do not buy this item.
2,Broken teeth,"I got my trimmer and it works great, save for the half row of broken-off teeth on top. It makes using the trimmer alone, without attachments, a harrowing experience, fraught with pain."
5,Super Great!,"I really like the Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer. I like the fact that I can leave it plugged in, and never have to worry about it ovwercharging. Whenever I need to use it, it's ready to go. It makes keeping my beard very easy to keep trimmed."
3,3 star --- OK,"The blades are very delicate.If the trimmer falls once on floor, that's it, the blades will break. I need to return one because of that reason. Other than that it is very trimmer."
1,Amazon lied,"I did a search for razors made in the U.S.A. I specifically didn't want a product made in China. When I performed my search this product was listed as made in the U.S.A. Imagine my disgust when I got the product and my husband opened it up and clearly stamped into the metal it proudly announced ""Made in China"". Will not be buying from Amazon anymore except for books."
2,Not the closest shave.,"I find myself reaching for this product very rarely. It does not cut close enough to the skin. Buy it with that in mind. You will need something else, like a razor or an electric shaver to finish the job. If this would cut closer, you wouldn't need anything else to trim a beard or goatee."
4,work good,"works good dont cut very though its more like a small set of clippers works while charging ,"
2,Too cheapy. Breaks easily,"I bought this trimmer because I wanted something simple to trim my sideburns. However, it turned out to be of bad quality.First, the attachment are made out of plastic. You have to snap them into position on the trimmer, but because they're plastic, the places where the attachments latch onto the trimmer are now broken or too loose, and now they keep falling all the time.Also, the trimmer itself is too rough. It scratches my skin sometimes.Bottom line, if you want a trimmer that will last, don't buy this one. It's cheap, but for just a few more bucks you can buy something of better quality."
1,mister mr,"this item broke as soon as i plugged it into a foreign outlet lierally. i arrived in China on March 23, 2011 and as soon as i plugged it in the red light stayed on briefly then faded yet to come back on.....i will be returning this as soon as i get home hopefully getting a refund or exchange...."
1,Useless Cheap Knockoff,"The only thing that could help this product is to make it heavier so you could at least use it as a paperweight. As a trimmer, you'd have better luck using a sharp rock to trim facial hair."
4,Works Great!,"This trimmer is everything I expected when I ordered it. Love all the different attachments to get just the right length! I find the stubble attachement to be my favorite. Battery life seems to be great, haven't even charged it since I got it and it's still chugging away! Only con is when I went to rinse it under the water real quick I guess I didn't dry it off enough and it started to rust already. That's the reason I gave it four stars."
1,Blades and replacement,"I am really sad, the blades for this trimmer suddenly broke downwith out explanation, so I am searching where can I buy thereplacement blades but so far I haven't find where....I wouldn't recommend this product"
4,great bang for your buck,the trimmer is constructed pretty solid and the blades are excellent. not to mention this product an excellent buy for just regular touchups. i think the only thing i could fault this trimmer for were the attachments because they were a little too tiny and difficult to put on.
2,Get a corded Trimmer,"I have this trimmer and I have to say it is extremely frustrating. After charging this thing overnight (and more ) the trimmer starts out barely moving. Within 5 minutes it speeds up some, and after you have cut most your beard and mustache at this slower speed the machine finally gets close to what I would say is 3/4 speed when I'm already done. So I tried to ""outsmart"" the machine and turned it on for 5 minutes to warm up, but when I did, the machine went even slower and never got up to speed. It drove me crazy. I have a full speed Oster hair trimmer that is corded and that really is the only thing that has the power to tackle any hair cutting,since it does not rely on a lame battery.Get a corded 120v cutter of some type. Bottomline you get what you pay for and this is cheap."
4,"Excellent value, long-lasting","I've had this trimmer for 4 years. This trimmer works great, I hardly ever have to recharge the battery, I get a close and quick trim every time. I will say I had difficulty with the cheap plasticy guards, which I threw out and I just use the trimmer guardless and it works fine that way. I played with those guards many times and I couldn't get it to fit on the trimmer correctly- so for that reason I give it 4 stars not 5. It also works well for grooming ""sensitive areas"", if you're careful with it. Overall, for the price, this trimmer is unbeatable. It's small, portable and easy to handle, fits snugly in the hand, and it's stood the test of time. If you're contemplating it, just buy one.. it's not even 20 bucks!"
4,Can't beat it for the price,The Wahl 9918-6171 is very solid to the touch. It was also able to chop down a very thick beard of mine in a matter of minutes.Great buy.
5,Good Beard Trimmer,Cheap in price but not in quality.Very good beard trimmer. I like that I can use it without having it plugged intoan electric outlet. I would certainly recommend it.
3,its ok.,"its an alright product. i've had the opportunity to try it out a few times already. i'm not crazy about it. there's really nothing that stands out about it. it's just ""ok"""
3,It's okay,"I bought this and it works fine, but then I bought an electric shaver and didn't use this anymore. I gave it to my son."
4,Very Nice Trimmer! Received today...,"I just received this Wahl trimmer today and am very happy! I bought it after reading many other reviews on Amazon, and many of the good reviews were true. The trimmer has already given me noticeably the nicest trim I've ever had. It trims very fast and smooth, very evenly, and does not catch or pull on any whiskers like some of my other trimmers have. Also, the main adjustable length attachment trims very close on my mustache under my nose, where some others have not.Some of the critiques that I read are correct also. The trimmer is quite noisy, though I don't mind that too much. Also, the plastic attachments were difficult to use. They didn't attach easily the first time, but I assume that will become much easier with some practice.So far, I'm very satisfied, especially for the price! Highly recommended!"
4,"So far, it's great!","I got this trimmer for my husband not too long ago. He has very coarse beard/moustache hairs and requires frequent trimming. So far, he is very happy with this trimmer. It holds a charge well, and is a vast improvement over other inexpensive trimmers he has had in the past. It is also very comfortable and easy for him to hold and operate (he is a quadriplegic, so doesn't have a strong grip). He likes the placement of the sliding switch and button, because he can operate it independently even with his limitations. He does wish it were easier to replace into the holder, and also wishes it were a little easier to plug in for recharging. But other than those minor things he is completely satisfied with this model."
4,sleek/functional,I use this every couple of days to trim my mustache. It seems to hold a charge for quite a while and keeps sharp. I've owned and used this trimmer for a little over a month and am satisfied with it. It is as advertised.
3,Great systems but one problem,The whole system is of good quality but the blades are set to only give stubble cut and I wanted a skin close cut for trimming.
3,"Great trimmer, not so good attachments.","The trimmer is very solid. It holds a great charge. I bought it because it has a rechargeable battery and the price was right.The attachments on the other hand are not that great. There are two tabs that hold the attachment to the trimmer. One of the attachment have already broke after just a few uses. I will continue to use the trimmer, but i will be in the market for another with better constructed attachments."
2,Poor Quality,"Within a year, this unit no longer held a charge. Two years later it doesn't work at all. It also went through periods of time where it'd pull hairs, even with regular lubrication. I'm looking for a replacement."
4,Good Trimmer,"Purchased this in October and have been using til now. So been through plenty of use. It does what its supposed to, have not had any issues with it all. Just left out one star for it not being as powerful as trimmers I have had in the past(norelco brand, forget exact model). Otherwise, good quality and hope it lasts me a while. The battery definitely lasts a while, only recharge every 3 to 4 days."
2,"not pleased w/battery life, attachments and size","i've been using the beard trimmer for about 5 months now. the first 2 months were great - the charge held for about a weeks worth of daily use (i have a short beard) and the performance was great. now i have to keep it plugged in all the time, it doesn't work ""cordless"" anymore, which is my main complaint.the attachments for different levels of trimming are also fairly difficult to remove/attach.i don't like how long it takes to trim my beard each morning, it just doesn't have the power or ""surface trim area""while i don't really have much good to say, i can't say i'm entirely upset with the purchase, i mean for $25 what can you expect?i'll be going to a corded trimmer next."
3,Too loud,"I have a Wahl Revolution trimmer (red) that is maybe 8 years old. The battery would no longer take a charge. I could not find a replacement battery, so I bought the current Wahl Groomsman trimmer. I found it to be much too loud, and not as comfortable to use, so I returned it. I then removed the battery from my old trimmer. A day later I replaced it, and found it would now take a charge. So I will continue to use my old Wahl trimmer. In my experience the new Wahl trimmers are not as good as the older ones."
4,Wahl 9918-617 Trimmer,Good product. Worth the money. Just be carefull when installing or removing the beard guide.
2,It's like shaving with a lawn mower,"Had this about 2 months now. Great shaver. Works well. Easy to use, but it's so loud that I have trouble using for any length of time near my ears. I thought about using earplugs or purchasing a different shaver. So there's a notable downside to this shaver."
4,Does its job!,"Small and does its job very well, what more do you need?! Its an electric razor, it works, charges and runs great!"
2,Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer,"I bought this to replace a nearly identical clipper. The old clipper had quit holding a charge after many years of good service. The only noticeable difference was this one was chromed and my old one was gray. However the differences did not stop there. This clipper does not cut hair!!! Fortunately my old blades fit this clipper and worked great. If you do not have the good blades, steer clear of this product"
2,Razor just not for me,"This ""maybe"" a good product to some but I am a very simple man. There are too many parts and it's difficult to figure out how to get the different parts onto the razor itself. It shouldn't be brain surgury to simlpy trim my beard. I can't even figure out how the different parts sit on the holder. I need a simpler razor and most likely be throwing this one in the trash and purchasing a simpler one. I was in a bit rushed to make this purchase but now that I have trimmed down my beard to almost nothing because I couldn't figure out how to use the razor, I have plenty of time to go to a store and look at different models and pick one that is more suited for a simple person like myself. I have never had a problem with a purchase on Amazon prior to this but like I said I was in a bit of a rush."
2,It is okay to use,poor quality of brush & other accessories and easily broken plastics. Also blade quality is Okay Okay and not as expected. Skin gets shock effect frequently.
3,"Holds a charge for a long time, adjustable trimmer attachment needs improvement","I bought this to replace an adjustable trimmer that I had previously. That one had a wheel on the trimmer itself to adjust the cutting height. This trimmer uses a snap on guide that slides to the number you select. This does not work as effectively as it has popped off numerous times during use. It makes me a little uneasy using this knowing I might accidently shave off way more hair than I intended. The trimmer itself cuts great and keeps a charge for a long time. I like the stand that holds the trimmer and attachments...it makes it fit neatly in my medicine cabinet. Overall, an ok product, but if you need the adjustable trimmer function often...look elsewhere or use it with care."
2,good trimming-bad battery,"I bought it last June and i realized a few days ago that it could not charge any more. although it was a good trimmer adjustable and powerful, i believe that battery's death after such a sort period is disappointing. i did not give it one star because as long as it worked it was really helpful. i suggest you go look for something else cause in this price range there are quite a few choices. i just ordered a different one."
3,Wahl 9918-6171 trimmer,"i got this trimmer thinking of the price you cant go wrong with that, the trimmer cut great and once you get the hang of putting the attachments on there not that bad. The only thing that i didn't like about it was that after about a month of use it started to show signs rust on the blade and i was using the oil ever time i used it but it still cuts great so overall great for the price."
2,Works for a while,"It was a great trimmer for about 6 months. After that the blades must have become dull because it won't cut facial hair anymore. It still works on softer hair such as sideburns, but not on beard hair which is more coarse(especially if you have a few gray ones). The hair just seems to bounce off the moving blades now."
2,Wahl trimmer,"I must say I'm disappointed. While the cutting action and accessories are fine, I find that the top metal part / blades tend to rust rather quickly. Looks nice and shiny when you get it, but it doesn't stay that way for long. This item is only a few weeks old and already showing rust. This happened once before on a Wahl I bought a few years ago. I will not buy a Wahl product again, since they both appeared to have this same problem."
1,save your money,"this was a waste of money. I read the reviews and decided to buy it, what a mistake. Attachment is extremely flimsy/weak and does trim very well. I'd give it zero stars if that was an option"
2,Cheap and weak,"I have been using an old Wahl hair trimmer on my beard for the past few years, however I started traveling frequently and liked the idea of having a more compact trimmer. I have only used the trimmer with the stubble attachment, however it takes much longer. It doesn't pull, but it's so weak it takes multiple passes (10+) on an area in order to cut all the hair.In addition, the construction is much less impressive than on my hair trimmer and the travel pouch is make of plastic. Overall I was disappointed and expected a better product from Wahl."
4,"Good, but not what I was looking for","This is a very good electric razor/trimmer. I was hoping to use it to maintain a stubble look. Unfortunately, the stubble guide keeps my stubble a bit too long for my taste. And just using the razor keeps the stubble a bit too short. If you're looking for a razor that will maintain a ""2-day look,"" this is not it."
1,Solid Trimmer/Poor Attachments,"The Wahl Groomsman is a solidly built trimmer, but the plastic attachments are not. I used this trimmer for my beard 3 times before the plastic guide broke and fell off. I could not correct the angle in time and now have no beard! (I guess I won't be needing the trimmer after all!)Buyer beware! This is NOT the Wahl product you remember!"
2,Worked for about a year then battery died,"I was disappointed with this trimmer at first--it seemed cheaply built. It worked fine though for about a year, with weekly or bi-monthly use. After a year, the battery died. It still works when plugged in."
2,It's ok,Not as user friendly as previous Wahl's I've owned. Too many attachments to keep up with and change out. I liked my old Wahl where I simply changed the number setting and got a uniform cut.
4,"Very Good Product, But...","I have a full beard at short length. The Wahl trims evenly with no pull. The handle is shaped easy to hold. This trimmer beats the pants off the C****r I had before. Watch out, the plastic spacer combs that fit over the blades are on TIGHT!!! Hard to get on and off."
2,Solid trimmer w/ crappy attachments,"This is my 4th trimmer, but my first from Wahl. The trimmer itself is solid. If that's all you want, go for it. But the attachments that make it useful as a beard/mustache trimmer? Feh.Each has to be snapped into place individually. Others, one slides the trimmer guide on once and then adjusts it to different positions. Wahl has one attachment like that, but it is a pain to move. Nothing half as easy as the Panasonic or Phillips. There is no easy way to store the attachments either. The base only has room for about half of them. Oh, and to recharge, one has to plug the sucker in. Others, one simple drops into the base. This was a good model, say, 40 years ago. Now? It's cheap."
2,Trimmer,I'd stay away from this trimmer if you are looking to switch guides every now and then. The attachments are pretty flimsy and you'll be very lucky if you don't break one trying to install and remove them.
4,Does what it's supposed to.,"I bought this to replace the same model I had for years.If you're looking to cut some hair this will sure do it for you, the only issues I have with it are that it's hard to clean under the head so it ends up getting loud, and the teeth on it are quite sharp so be mindful of that if you don't have guard on it."
3,"Works well, but dies in a few years","My second one of these just died, which is both good and bad I guess. Good because I liked it well enough to buy a second one when the first died, but bad that my current one is also dead now. It seems to me like these trimmers only last a few years, which I guess is not that surprising for the $15 price point, but I just expect things like this to last longer. Maybe I'm just unreasonable. I would pay more for a trimmer that lasts longer."
1,Terrible design,"This is a poorly designed product. It was difficult to assemble and actually hurt the only time I tried it. It has inferior accessories, does not trim smoothly and as I mentioned really hurt when trimming a fairly short beard. I had a norelco before, and just ordered another one. This one was bad, really bad. Do not buy it."
4,"excellent performance, but noticeably loud","I use this without the trimming guides and it performs exactly as I'd hoped. I get the trim I want quickly and cleanly; and, as others have stated, it's light and easy to handle. My only complaint is how amazingly LOUD it is for such a small device. The price-to-performance comparison is hard to beat, but for my next trimmer purchase I'll be looking into something a little quieter..."
4,Nice Trimmer,"I bought this in 2010 and still my favourite tool for keeping my beard nice and smooth. The only problem is that the battery doesn't take charge anymore and I always have to use it with the adapter, not big deal for me but if you want something TOTALLY portable, this battery will give you some problems."
4,Options,Using this razor with or without a cord is an advantage. very light weight compared to its professional brothers. I wouldn't use it for a heavy beard. But for sideburns and trimming lip or the back of the neck it's great. keep it oiled after every use and it will be somewhat quieter too.
4,excellent trimmer,"I bought this trimmer after much research online. I hate charging gadgets and would rather have a cord to use with the eletrical socket or a battery that lasts long. This trimmer provides both.As to the quality of the product, I think its excellent. Cuts and trims well. I didnt need a heavy duty trimmer, since I dont have a beard to trim and use it only to trim my mustache. Overall, very satisfied."
4,Well built trimmer,"This is the second mustache/beard trimmer I've owned,the first was a Norelco Maverick T-3000,made of mostly plastic parts,the only metal was the blades,what held the blade assembly to the body was made of plastic and the blade would always pop off the body,poorly made and cost more then this Wahl.The Wahl is made of metal,the blade assembly is attached to the body with screws and is all metal.I've had this razor for a little over 2 months,so I can't comment on the battery life,yet.It feels good in the hand,small and light,but sturdy,not like it's about to fall apart like the Norelco.The attachments slip on and clip tight.Highly recommend this trimmer and this brand,good quality.Wahl Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer - 9918-617"
3,"Good machinery, not so good user's advice","Good value: you get a lot of equipment, all ofit made in China. The powered cutter is good quality. Some of the add-on parts have skimpy instructions, or none, as if the buyer is an old hand at mustaches and beards. Getting the needed pieces to fit together takes a bit of repetition. All this said, you get a lot for your money, and with repetition and a bit of skill you should end up with a good system. The price is really reasonable.Whenyou've managed to get going, beards can be easily and effectively trimmed, mustaches are easy care and the total effect is excellent. Just a little more understanding of the new,inexperinced faces would be a real help."
4,Good Purchase,This is my second Wahl. The first one lasted 14 years. I expect nothing less from this.
5,Great trimmer,Great product. Highly recommend it perfect for the job works great will buy more as gifts for my friends and family
4,"Good trimmer, finicky attachments","It's a pretty well built and overall usable trimmer, but the attachments are kind of a pain to use. There are two types it comes with:1) There are several ""fixed length"" attachments which are easy to use, but aren't labeled and all look very similar.2) There is an adjustable attachment which changes between lengths 1-5, but it is a pain to get on the trimmer and I feel like I'm going to break the thing when I change the lengths.Once you get the desired attachment on, it's smooth sailing. I lost the charger for mine and think I'm going to spend the extra $10 on the Remington MB-300. That model also claims not to need oil on the blades. The Wahl comes with oil to use with it but if you forget to use it you will end up with rusty blades like I did."
2,"Good shaver, not good trimmer",The razor still works but the plastic attachments are plastic and break easily. I am ordering another brand but I could not recommend this. The whole reason for having a beard/mustache trimmer is having quality attachments that allow for different levels of trim. The quality of these attachments is sub par and not worth it at any cost.
4,Wahl 9918-617 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer,My old trimmer had a charger stand otherwise a good trimmer. I've owned Wahls for 20+ years and this trimmer is what I would expect from Wahl.
1,Made in China,Broke a cutting blade the first time I turned it on. Didn't even get to trim my mustache! Package says Wahl has been inventing & manufacturing grooming appliances for over 89 years in Sterling Il. Groomer says Made in China.
3,Works as Expected,"I was initially looking to buy a replacement battery for a trimmer that I already owned but buying this new trimmer was much more cost efffective. The price was good, but you get what you pay for. The carrying case and holder are very cheaply made and are next to useless. But the blade attachments were sufficient for trimming my beard.I wish that there was a battery indicator so you would know when to charge the battery. As it is, they only provide a NiCd battery which should be discarded before the next full charge to prevent memory lost."
4,woohal...,"Yes it does what it says on the tin, works efficient feels nice in the hand.not had for a while yet but i do use it pretty often and it still trims like day one!"
5,Wahl Groomsman,Works great so far (1 month). The plastic fittings are a little tricky but once they get broke in (loosen up) they work well.
4,Durable Product,I had this model before and will be getting another one. The only reason my first one died was because i dropped it several times by mistake. This product lasted about 4 years for me. As long as you take care of it properly it could have lasted even more.
1,Caveat Emptor,"This Wahl trimmer is a true piece of junk. The blades were dirty. Its attachments do not fit, wobble, and quickly break. Do not buy this rubbishy item!"
4,Great bang for the Buck,"This is a good trimmer, with decent attachments - my only qualm is that it cannot be rinsed clean with water. The cleaning brush is great and it has a great little stand."
4,A good beard trimmer,"I had an older model Wahl needing replacement and this one is almost identical. I think the cutting blades may be just a little bit different since I occasionally get a 'bite' while trimming. It does not happen often, and may be operator error. The accessories are okay, but I know I will lose most of them even though a cute little bag is included. I have tried other brands over the years and Wahl has always given me the best for the buck."
1,Piece of junk,"Who designed this piece of junk? I've owned several beard trimmers over the years, including a couple of Wahls. This is by far the worst trimmer I've ever purchased. I opened it up and was very surprised at how cheap the attachments were. Very difficult to get on and off, and about the flimsiest plastic you could ever imagine. I finally got the main attachment on and turned on the trimmer. And as I did, the power switch broke. That's right. The first time I turned it on, the power switch BROKE. This trimmer is a piece of junk. Period. If I could've given it zero stars, I would have. I'm returning it to Amazon immediately."
2,"Works fine, but attachments are sub par.","I've had mine for about four years now and it still works great. The only problem is that the plastic clip-on attachments wore out after six months and no longer stay clipped on. I have to hold them in place with one finger, which makes opperation a complete pain. Maybe this is why the trimmer has held up so long. Its such a bother now that I almost never use it!"
4,Great for trimming,"On the 1st day I used, got 2 compliments on how neat my beard and mustach was trimmed.Found the larger attachment a little difficult to remove."
2,"Good trimmer, poor design of adjustable trimming guide","Overall this trimmer seems to be of high quality and works well. However there is one glaring flaw in the design. The trimmer comes with a ""6-position guide"" attachment that allows you to adjust the trim length without changing attachments. It is a great idea with a flawed implementation. One must still remove this attachment to do edge touch up, and to clean the blades. I find this adjustable guide very difficult to remove, and even more difficult to put back on. While trying to do this the adjustable guide came apart. The instructions note that the guide comes in two pieces that should not be separated. Well, if that is the case why make it in two pieces? I eventually got it back together and back on the trimmer. What a PITA! I have to struggle with this thing every time I use it."
1,Solid Trimmer - Poor Attachments - Second Opinion,"The metal trimmer is excellent quality. But it is no better than the attachments that allow trimming. These attachments are almost impossible to attach to the metal trimmer. I could not get the main attachment to attach in spite of my best efforts. This makes the trimmer useless. The instructions did not explain at all how to attach, only how to use the trimmer after an attachment was on. I agree wholeheartedly with the other user's comment that this is not the Wahl we used to know."
4,"Excellent small beard trimmer, cheap accessories","I've had four beard trimmers in the past 10 years. A Panasonic, a Remmington, a Phillips and now this Wahl. Out of all of them this Wahl cuts the best. Clean and quick with no pulling or catching. The drawbacks are the small blade size and the pathetically cheap snap on accessories. I managed to get the accessory I need onto it with much difficulty and I'm not sure it will come off without breaking. As long as it lasts for a couple of years, I'll be happy."
4,Great Trimmer!,"I've had this for almost two years now. The on/off switch is a pain in the rear to switch and the battery life is starting to go but the other model I had before this one (Can't remember the model# but was a Wahl) lasted me less than a half year before the blade was too dull to trim any longer. This one still trims it right off. If the on/off switch wasn't so ridiculously hard to switch I'd have given it 5 stars.UPDATE:August 20, 2011 - This thing still trims just great! Battery is holding less charge as time goes on but I did discover if you hook it up to the adapter it runs at full power instantly. I love this trimmer. Still trims like it did the day I got it!"
2,bad quality,very disappointed with the trimmer. the engine is not powerful and it takes a long time to shave. do not buy this machine!
2,Disatisfied with trimmer.,I am very disappointed with the trimmer because some of the accessaries do not fit like they should. I have owned Wahl products before and have never been dissatisfied with them. I doubt that I will buy any more on line.
3,Wahl Groomsman,"The trimmer itself is very satisfactory. It lives up to the name Wahl, however the attachments are not. They are very flimsy and hard to attach to the trimmer. I could not get one of the attachments to even go over the head at all. If you are using the trimmer for close cutting it is really good, However if you want to trim with an attachment I would not recommend this machine."
4,For an afternoon of fun...,"Read this book. It's fun in a literary sort of way, so if you're not into that kind of thing, then you might want to give it a miss. I love reading and aspire to be one of those arty, high brow literary types but know I can't, so I read books like these to live vicariously through the characters. But seriously, enough with the bad reviews already! This is an entertaining, quirky, and humorous read. Sure, the characters are annoying at times... but they're meant to be that way, and besides, name one person in your own life who isn't. There you go! So read this book (be sure to have a cup of coffee and some cookies nearby, because it's just that sort of book) and come back here and tell us how much you enjoyed it."
4,clever and inspiring,"I loved this book. What it says about love on its final page is so true. The main character has her flaws, sure, but don't we all? I identified with her more because of them. You'll probably like this book if you're familiar with academic theory; otherwise you might not recognize some of the jokes/types."
1,boring,"actually barely managed to finish this. tried to appreciate the satire, the (ponderous musing), the literary references, but just didn't care...main character boring, silly in spite of her braininess. husband an academic stereotype...good part? her lack of memory, a true challenge ..."
4,A story of trust and love mis-placed,"This was a great read. I enjoyed it throughly. Ms. Clark developes wonderful characters, and she uses them to masterfully keep you guessing to the end. Like most of Ms. Clark's novels this story has a surprise ending that won't dissapoint.After reading this book I felt as is I was looking for something more in the end, and it would be easy enough to spin a sequel from the open ending. That just isn't Ms. Clark's style however. Even with an ending that I felt left too many loose ends, I didn't come away from this read with any true dissapointment. I would definitely recommend this novel to any reader looking for suspense."
5,An interesting plot and No smutt!,"This is a novel that you can not put down until it is finished! You can share this with your teenagers, too. The plot, characters and story line are very interesting and suspenseful. The smutt and vulger language is eliminated which makes this very enjoyable."
2,Before I Say Good-By (Unabridged),"This is not one of her better books. I have the feeling she has now gone into production, rather than being creative and fresh.Entertaining, but not a great mystry."
2,Disappointing,I am a regular reader of Mary Higgens Clark and I did not find this book enjoyable. I am not good at figuring out 'who did it' but I had this one pegged by the middle of the book. I found the character interactions unrealistic and the overall plot lame. SKIP IT!
3,Before I Say Goodbye,"Wow. What a yawn. If I weren't so compulsive about finishing a book, I would have set this one down within the first 50 pages.Clark usually does a good job with her thrillers. But this one sure was lackluster."
3,Not The Best,As always I enjoy all MHC's Books....But this one was not as spellbinding as many others I have read. This one I could put down! Others I've read on into the night!
1,Not That Good,"I am a huge Clark fan...but this one was awful....rambled on and on and on...did not have the usual excitement. Very predictable outcome. The first time I stood up and took notice was at the last few chapters. Being a fan I would say buy it, as an avid reader I would say skip it."
3,Predictable,Now I remember why I don't read too much fiction...it's not a very challenging book. Good for a plane ride home.
4,Before I Say Goodbye,Higgins-Clarke does it again! Truly suspenseful story of a young ambitious woman who loses her husband in a questionable accident. Through her pshyic ability and with the help of others struggles through to find the answer of why this horrible accident happened in the first place only to find out that she should of been questioning her past.
2,Couldn't finish,"I love MHC normally, but couldn't finish this. BORING! If you want a good book, go back and read one of her early ones...Remember Me, All Around Town, there are lots - just skip this one."
4,Out of the Ordinary,"Nell follows in her grandfather's footsteps in running for his congressional seat. But many unknown facts in Nell's husband's past may end up setting her up for a great pulicity scandal. When an explosion on Nell's husband's boat kills 4 including her husband things get much more complicated. Then as investigators and Nell herself looks into the case, much disturbing information is set out in the open.This was a very different book that Mary Higgins Clark has written. It is a little off the beaten path when she adds a psychic/medium into the story as a help to the main character, Nell. But Clark still does an outstanding job in portraying a very first hand feeling. Her descriptions of the important facts in the book are very precise and well thought out. In doing this Clark uses a lot of figurative language and sense images, which also help in the visualization of the objects or people."
4,Mary Higgins Clark's best in years!,"I thought Mary Higgins Clark was developing the John Grisham syndrome, i.e. simply churning out books for the sake of a multi-million dollar contract. Her last two books, ""We'll Meet Again"" and ""Moonlight Becomes You"" were formulaic, implausible, and boring. However, Clark seems to have returned to form with ""Before I Say Goodbye."" The characters are about as developed as you can expect from any of her mysteries, but this time Clark makes the plot tighter, and as a result, the book is more suspenseful. I can honestly say that I was kept guessing right up until the last few chapters. Clark's trademark of having many characters and varied plotlines is present, but it works to the book's advantage, although the romance between the main character and the doctor seemed a bit forced. For fans of Mary Higgins Clark, like me, who have been disappointed with her last books, ""Before I Say Goodbye"" is a return of the best of the Clark style we know and love."
1,A clear disappointment for Higgins Clark fans,"Mary Higgins Clark's lastest novel is a clear disappointment for her fans and suspense fans in general. Her characters are too predicatble and the average mystery enthusiast has the whole thing figured out about half-way through. My biggest disappointment is the overall shoddy work she does on the story line. There is so little intriguing detail and almost no flesh to the main lines of the plot. This book is not even in the same league as some of her great earlier ones like ""loves music, loves to dance"" or ""let me call you sweetheart"". While it is OK that she always seems to depict the stereotypical all-American Barbie or Cinderalla from-rags-to-riches heroine, she puts less and less effort in making the charcters believable."
1,The only mystery here is how did this book get good reviews?,"I've been an avid fan of Mary Higgins Clark since I was a teenager and in the last 4 years or so her books have gone from well written mysteries to a sort of just cranking out another formulaic story for her legions of readers. In ""Before I Say Goodbye"" there is no real psychic mystery, no real sense of connection with her one dimensional characters, and certainly no real sense of menace that used to pervade Mary Higgins Clark's books. Instead it just seemed like she was going through the motions and taking the easiest and the least challenging way out. Why did I bother finishing the book? Why did I even buy this one after disliking her last 4? Sentimental feelings I guess. I have to confess that Clark managed to redeem herself from page 256 til the end. In those 18 pages I read what I have expected from MHC all along, well written suspense. Maybe there's hope after all."
2,"GHOST, anyone?","I have been a MHC fan for years, and anxiously await her new novels, but while reading her latest, I felt like I was reading a piece from the movie GHOST. While I did enjoy the novel, I was a tad disappointed in the storylines. I feel that the herione's character was not developed enough, and instead of feeling empathy for her, I began to wish that it was she on the boat, instead of her husband. I've been noticing a trend in MHC's latest novels...they are beginning to seem like V.C. Andrew novels- there's the good girl who has all of the horrible, non-deserving things happen to her, (yet of course, she is an ultraprofessional with the best wardrobe), in comes a handsome stranger who enivtably will make it ""all better"" and they both live happily ever after. True fans will buy the hardcover,while everyone else will wait for it in paperback. I hope that Mrs. Clark's next novel more like her original stories."
2,Her Very Worst,"I am a big fan of Ms. Clark's work, but I was very disappointed with this book. It was poorly written and poorly edited. One major inconsistency was already mentioned by another reviewer, but there were many others. For example, two characters have the exact same conversation with each other only 15 pages apart. Another example that is difficult to illustrate without giving away the ""surprise ending"" has the ""villian"" thinking something to him or herself in the beginning of the book that would have been impossible for the villian to be thinking. The book had a neat idea, but seemed to be hastily and sloppily written."
3,A good mystery but nothing special,"If you like MHC's other books, you'll probably like this one. It's neither her worst or her best but somewhere in the middle."
2,my review,"Even though I started liking this book and had gotten into the plot, I found in incredible inconsistency in the story: in page 81 it is mentioned that ""Lisa"" has already spoken to the widow on the phone to air her worries, then in page 183 it mentions that ""Lisa"" want to talk to the widow but doesn't know how to contact her, so she goes through her grandfather to find her phone number....????Otherwise, I did enjoy the book and the plot and really could never have guessed the ending! The characters are likable enough and you do get a positive feeling of New York.Besides the big inconsistency, the book is worth reading."
3,"Too many characters, too soon","I have almost all of Mary Higgins Clark's books but this one has way too many characters to make for a relaxing read. It was ""work"" just trying to keep remembering who's who. The story, however, was interesting and enjoyable."
4,Clark hasn't given up yet,"Though it may not compare to some of her earlier works (""A cry in the night"", ""The cradle will fall""- need I say more?) Mary Higgins Clark has succeeded in creating a light read of the all-too-familiar tale of a troubled woman looking for answers, but this time the story may go a little differently than expected. It's not the first time Clark has gone supernatural on us, but she excels in making the thought of psychic powers logical, if not believable. With one of those surprise endings she's famous for, Clark ties up the conclusion with some fancy penmanship you won't want to miss. But beware- character and plot development are scarce. This is a good book to read when you don't want to be really tied down by the story. It was easy to put down early in the story, and Mary really only shows her true excellence in the conclusion. A word of advice, if you stumble on to one of her earlier works before this one- by all means- read those!!!"
3,Made for TV Movie....,"I don't get to read too many books d/t kids, work, etc., so when I recently went on a child-less vacation I searched the racks for a really good book to read. I had much pre-book stress in making sure I made a good selection. Well, although the story was interesting, it was far from an entrenching novel I desired. My best description of the story is that it smacks of a made-for-TV type story. It goes on, but never really achieves a heightened climax. Very ""G"" rated."
5,She's Done It Again!,"Mary Higgins Clark has once again out-done herself! This book is rivetting! The plot keeps you up well into the night,and chances are you don't sleep until you've finished! A great read for anyone that likes a good page turner."
2,"Okay, I guess.",Not her best. I so enjoy this author but this book fell a bit short.The Characters seem to be all over the place. And the underlying suspense seemed to fail with all the attention on the widow. I thought the subplots did not get pulled back to the main story.
3,Worth a read but not a listen,"This isn't Mary Higgins Clark's best, but it's still an entertaining story. Unfortunately, I got the audio version in which the narrator's interpretation of men's voices consists of sounding uniformly surly, regardless of individual personalities or attitudes. This one would be better read than heard."
3,Slow paced but interesting.,"This is the kind of book that one reads just to read something not too boring. It does have a bit of suspense, which makes you keep going back to it, but if you put it down and forgot about it, you wouldn't be missing a lot. Nell is our main character, the granddaughter raised by a highly political grandfather, with political aspirations of her own that are being suppressed by her husband, Adam. Adam is much too vague a figure, and when Mary Higgins Clark gets into the psychic-reaching-the-dead portion of the story, it flops. Still, the book was interesting enough that I did finish it, and some of the characters are clever and enticing. The story itself is pretty clever, although the land deals will have you scratching your head trying to figure it all out. A good read, but I wouldn't rush right out and buy it. Mary Higgins Clark has done much better."
5,One of her best,"Admittedly, I am a MHC junkie...have read most if not all of her books...and in a sense this follows the standard MCH plot...beautiful people, set in and around New York City...heroine is a beautiful upper-crust New York lady...but the twists and turns in the plot of this novel, even including the homeless (in a very sympathetic light) and the people who deal with the beyond....is very interesting and places a different dimension on this very intriguing page-turner."
3,A good read with some basic problems,"I have one major dislike with mystery stories. The author devises a good plot but then falls short in his or her story telling abillity. MHC is better than most at building characters and telling a story, but she fell into the trap of too many characters all of which had a motive and were suspect. I felt, rightly or wrongly, that she wrote her story then picked who she wanted for the guilty person and made the conclusion fit the rest of the story. The telling of the story should be the prime reason for writing, and the mystery should be secondary. Very few mystery writers understand that in my opinion. MHC is one of the better mystery writers who attempts to mix both."
1,Bad story...,"The story is very weak: Nell MacDermont wants to run for congress following her granfather's example. But her husband, Adam Cauliff, suddenly opposes this idea, even though he originally supported it. They have a huge fight and a day later Adam and a few others are killed in a mysterious explosion on his boat.Nell now has to deal with Adam's death, while many facts seem to suddenly show up that he wasn't an honest man. She is also contacted by a famous psychic who claims to hear Adam's voice and gives Nell his love... But things are not as simple as they seem, and the tangled ending reveals a well planned scheme.The story line is weak and uses too many 'coincidences' for my taste, such as 2 simialar jackets... Also the character of Dan Minor is very weak and hard to believe - he hates his dad for leaving his mother and himself, while he spends years desperetaly searching for a mother who did the same to him later on..."
2,a disappointing read,"I was so excited to read the latest release from one of my favorite authors. I kept reading this book waiting to be captivated as I have been in the past by her characters and plot lines. Unfortunately, this never happened. I wonder if this book was rushed just to make money. Hope her next book is better>"
2,Not Mary Higgins Clark at her best!,"I was very disappointed in Clark's latest book. It seems that she has to write in a hurry now and cannot spend the amount of time she used to spend with her first books. In my opinion you could have turned this into a short story, just keep the beginning and the end and pitch the middle. Very repetitious and boring - it seemed we were just trying to fill pages. It's too bad that a great writer has to resort to this kind of writing just to get a book published!"
3,Very slow confusing start....several loose ends,"I started to read this book, put it down, and started again a few weeks later since I knew I liked the author even if I couldn't get into the book. I actually had to go back and take notes of the beginning chapters to keep everyone straight... I kept saying to myself who is this doctor character and why is he in this book anyway...? It was a real struggle to get through the first 1/3 of the book, but then picked up.At the end there were way too many loose ends. What happened to the guy whose mother sold the property? Was a reason given for why the villan's partner was his or her partner? Was Peter really in an accident, or was it made up?By no means was this Mary Higgins Clark's best book"
1,Disappointing,"Though I am usually one to buy Ms. Higgins Clark's books hot off the press, I wish I had left this one on the shelf. I'm halfway through and have decided not to finish - it's just too boring with repetitive information (how many times do we have to hear what a great guy Jimmy was or Nell's hesitation to consult a psychic, etc). Where Ms. Higgins Clark usually has me turning pages as quickly as I can, this book leaves me struggling to stay awake. Let's hope her next book is more in line with previous ones, especially her early novels."
3,Lacking,"I'm a big fan of MHC. I had read some of the reviews and couldn't wait to get the book and read it myself. But I'm disappointed. I found the book hard to get into and stay into. I usually love the fact that there are so many characters so you never really know until the end who done it, but I found this book with all of its characters a little confusing. I think this book was lacking the usual suspense found in Ms. Clark's books. The whole idea of communicating with the dead is interesting but I don't think it was a good basis for a book like this. I hope in the future Ms. Clark sticks with her old style of writing and puts more suspense into the book."
1,cured,"Ms Clark finally cured me of buying her books hot off the press and in hard cover. This book has no character development, no suspence and is not in keeping with all previous work by the author. By the middle of the book, I could not have cared less as to 'whodoneit' or even why. I will continue to by books by MHC in hopes that she will return to her original style, but I will wait for paperback editions in the future. Sorry, this is not what I expected from my previously favourite writer."
3,Spirits,"I've read almost every book of MHC (except for the very first one's). This one is not as good as the last one because I thought that she was going in an other path. I was up to the point where the main female caracter was going to see Bonnie (I read the french version - so the names may not be the same) and I said to myself Mary where are you going with this story... but I realized that she didn't take the wrong road. I was disapointed by the person that was left from the accident, I wish it would have been the ... But I have to say that each time a new book comes out I'm the first one to buy it. Thank you Mary for the stories that you bring."
4,Another good MHC novel,"Mary Higgins Clark never fails to be the queen of suspense. This is a great novel filled with psychics, murder, betrayel, politics, business in building, and just a hint of romance. While it never fails to be suspenseful the situation Nell gets in is predictable yet the surprising conclusion is not. If you like MHC you will love this one without a doubt."
3,Before I Say Good-Bye,"Although this is not MHC's best work, this book is worth the read. Nell MacDermott is toying with the idea of running for office. Nell has doubts, and her husband's alleged scam is a definite negative obstacle. When he becomes a victim of a boat explosion, Nell begins to look into her husband's life and finds more than she bargained for!The characters are not as well thought out in this book as they are in most MHC mysteries. However, it is still entertaining."
3,Battery 632007 is a NiCad,"NiCads get a memory and won't take a charge, One cell tends to go bad and the power is less.I hate em.Go for NiMHNickle Metal Hydride Batteries! No memory, keep them on the charger is no prob.More aH. time!"
4,Does what I need,It does what I need. I use it in my car and it doesn`t fit easily to the cup holder. However it is reliable.
5,good enough to reprint!,"This was my favorite of a trilogy written by Sarah Gainham concerning Austria under Hitler. It is also the first book in the trilogy. Entering the fictional but authentic world of Viennese theater people, we see the impact of the Anschluss on unexceptional citizens. A non-Jewish actress with a Jewish husband struggles to cope with all the pressures and threats surrounding her because of history and politics. The reader also learns much about the Austrian theater world. I would like to see the trilogy reprinted for a new generation of readers. Do you think we could get Oprah to consider it as a selection? P.S. I have no connection to author or publisher--just remember this book as one that really made an impact on me."
5,Excellent...,Bought the book as a gift. Recipient was very pleased with the book. It clearly describes the stitches and how to make them. Full of pictures that enable you to visualize the final result and the process of creating those stitches.
5,This Book Inspired Me!,"My mom bought me this book for my birthday, she said I needed to learn the family tradition of silk ribbon embroidery. Being a typical 15 year old, I was kindof sheepish about it, but as I started reading, I became captivated by it. I couldn't believe it! It was easy to read, very comprehensive (the other stitch books my mom had were hard to read and kind of boring) and fun! Each stitch is given a clear diagram so I could easily see the pattern. It was unreal! I actually liked something my Mom bought me! I have shared this book with all my friends(especially the girls, because they love guys who can stitch!) I love you Mom, kudos for Judith Baker Montano, I hope she has a follow up to this!"
5,Beautifully illustrated book.,"Physically, Judith's book is beautiful, containing many beautiful color pictures of her stiches. The book is also spiral bound so it lies flat while you are stitching. The book contains many beautiful stiches from beginner to advanced as well as samples of her work. She clearly illustrates each stitch technique. I purchased this book when I first became interested in silk embroidery and feel that it is the only book you will ever need. I highly recommend this book to all levels of silk embroiders."
4,guide to embroidery stitches,"great little book, small enough to keep with my embroidery projects. This is a new craft for me and I find this book well written with easily understandable diagrams of the stitches. Used book was in good condition as described"
5,"A beautiful, educational book all embroiderers will love!","The photos in this book depict some of the most inspirational needlework I've ever seen. Included are very clear diagrams and instructions to do hundreds of stitches. No matter what your skill level, if you love embroidery and needlwork, this is the one book you can't do without."
5,A wonderment of design,"This book has every stitch I could imagine in it, which is why I bought it! It is the perfect book for anyone wanting to do a crazy quilt or added embelllishment to any quilt or sewing project."
5,So Wonderful,Rarely do you hear such depth of feeling in a unique simple style as in Theresa's CD. There is so much feeling about God and relationships in this CD. I love listening to it.
3,slips,almost exact in molding to fit dimensions of the bed. it tends to slip around and i always have to adjust it to where it should be. but it is durable and easier to clean.
5,great,great forgot how many cds I bought but they all made it enjoy the oldclassics floyd sabbath ac dc ect
4,Honda Cabin Filter,"These filters are just right for Honda Accord, 1998. Have had them before and very satisfied.Will recorder again when I need to replace."
5,great product,"I use this cabin air filter for my 1998 Honda Accord Ex sedan, and it works just Great, very nice fit, exact fit for this model and year. ."
3,"Not a great fit, looks cheap.","I bought these for my Accord 99 and when trying to put them into the filter housing, neither of them would fit nicely, I had to squeeze it in there which bent the corners a bit, leaving a small opening on the side. Looks cheap, but does what is supposed to."
4,All Levels Happy,"I have taken and video-classed many a Pilates program. Rael's Pilates is top of the field in terms of addressing the reasons each exercise is performed, how it should look and feel and how to make it easier or harder depending on your level - I go with harder and it's amazing! I recommend this DVD set to anyone starting Pilates or looking to really get a workout and perfect their bodies at a higher level."
4,One of the best PIlates teachers out there,"This 3 pack of videos is a great selection of different Pilates workouts instructed by one Pilates most respected teachers. There are a zillion videos out there, for the ""true"" Pilates home experience this is a great buy and definitely the right price."
5,personal instruction at home,"The 3 pack gives you an opportunity to learn and master each level before progressing to the next. Rael is an amazing teacher with many years of experience which I believe enables him to cue so thoroughly each of the exercises, because he is aware of common misalignment and tendencies practitioners do, so he addresses them which helps you to be aware and make corrections. He teaches in a way that you will pick up deeper levels of instruction the more you improve and are ready to hear and assimilate the next layer. I love his accent and choice of descriptive words, they put a smile on my face, which makes the challenging portions more enjoyable. In comparison to Stott Pilates, I think they're great to get started, but I get so much more instruction and knowledge from Rael."
3,It was just...ok.,"It was not what I expected it to be. It started out slow then picked up, then went slow again. Ok, movie if you have absolutely nothing else to do."
1,What is the name of the actress who played Crystal,"The movie was horrible plain and simple. If you need to know why, others have posted the many reasons. I think the reviews that were positive were from the people who either directed or acted in it themselves.The only good thing about this movie was the girl who played the role of Crystal (she's ubber hot), but it's almost as if she doesnt exist, I can't find her name on any of the movie credits. Anyone know what her name is?"
1,Awful! Just awful! Can I give it zero stars?!?!?!!?,"Cringe-worthy acting and a vapid script. Over-the-top racialized stereotypes and unrealistic dialogue. (Sidenote: When is the last time you heard a black guy/girl say that they couldn't date another girl/guy because s/he is ""Chaldean?"" And then proceeding to break down the cultural differences between the Chaldeans and Lebanese. HUH?!?!?! Where they do that at? This movie is trying too hard and failing! ::eye roll::You will be sorely disappointed if you waste even a minute of your time on this sorry excuse of a movie. Don't be tempted one second by this so-called forbidden fruit..."
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie had horrible acting, no depth and clung to sterotypes like a baby clings to a bottle. All in all the movie was very cringeworthy...Definitely no bueno!"
3,bjsbeats,"As a collector of music from my youth, 50's and 60's especially, this is a very good collection. Most of the music wwere songs I knew and I was pleased by that. Not all Best?Greatest collections give a majority of music you know, this cd does."
2,Not Bad...Just Not Good!,"This production of Lucia is not the best there is. The acting is great and the set is very unique; however, the singing is not so good. Bonfadelli's voice is fine, just not suited for this particular role (in my opinion). The dynamic range of Bonfadelli's voice is not that great...there are many chances for beautiful, controlled pianissimo singing and it just doesn't happen. I think that the phrasing and breathing could have been a little more accurate. In the ""Mad Scene"" the staccato notes are good but the legato phrasing is a bit chopy. As I mentioned earlier, the acting is good, the facial expressions and mannerisms are very good, but the voice does not reflect what we see. I would highly recommend purchasing the French version LUCIE with Patrizia Ciofi...her voice is stunning and the acting is done very tastefully and holds true to the character. The French version is slightly different but still very pleasing to listen to."
5,"A witty, classy masterpiece!","My brother John and I performed in the second version of House of Trials, directed by the translator and performed at the International ""Siglo de Oro"" theatre festival in El Paso, Tx. Not only is the poetry beautiful and elegant, but it manages also to be clever and engaging. The translation is near perfection; it captures the rhythm of the words and transposes them seamlessly into English. A great piece to use for any study of Spanish Golden Age Drama!"
2,Mondo Porn,"Many years ago there were the Mondo movies. These movies took the viewer to exotic locations to witness strange occurrences and rituals. The idea was that by acting like a documentary, the film maker could show violence and nudity that would otherwise be censored. This movie seems to have been influenced by the Mondo craze.Set like a travelogue, Pleasure Spots journeys around to ""educate"" about certain sex practices. These include the known like legal prostitution in Nevada, and the unknown such as three people on a single marriage license. But for all its detail of so-called facts, it is all just an excuse to show people having sex. The action is silent with voice overs providing information.The action is tamer than in Senta, Danish Pastry it is also less prevalent with far more of the film being taken up by narrative and scenery. All in all a fairly weak effort even for its own time."
4,Review,"This product is great, I like it a lot. Only thing about it i don't like is the size. Overall it is very good."
4,Decent but Incomplete Collection,"The really big pop hits are here, with one curious exception: ""I Love Music"" is absent. Although the song can be found easily on other CDs, especially 70s collections, it is a mysterious omission on an otherwise affordable and satisfactory CD. All original versions, no liner notes."
2,not needed,I like to buy what I think is top of line when I buy and this kit is priced top of line but falls way short of that. 1st thing I noticed was case when unzipped was hard to open all the way and had open ends so when closed any small tool that became loose could fall out. 2nd thing was small screwdriver tip fell off when I used it and screw that holds it in was lost. 3rd thing was the block for holding bands was 2 small for my Seiko bands. Biggest disappointment was it did come with a sheet of paper labeling each tool from A-Z but no picture of which tool was which letter so that was useless. Last thing was it does not have a pin removal tool of the sort you can buy here for 4-20 dollars so to remove pins you have to use a hammer and punch and a block that would not fit my bands. My advice is save yourself money and buy 1 of the under 20 dollar kits sold here that comes with a link removal tool.
3,Watch Repair Tool Kit,I think some sort of book should have come with this kit. There are a lot of tools that I would have liked to have more details on.
5,Worth the money!,This bag is so nice looking. I haven't used it yet but I can't wait to. Looks like I could fit a good amount of things inside. Easy to roll around.
2,"biased,","the book is alright, definitely usefull, the problem it the heavy bias in the book,a lot of critical thinkers will notice the flaws in the book,i recommend the psychology of decision making"
5,May be the single best business book I've ever read,"Who knew that a business ""how to"" book could also be an enormously enjoyable and enlightening treatise on human relationships? Shell combines psychology, sociology, morality, and economics (and decades of personal and professional experience) to offer lessons you will not only want to do business by, but also to live by. ""Bargaining for Advantage"" will help you gain as much of an upper hand as you are comfortable gaining -- in any business situation -- and be happy doing it. Best of all, by nonfiction standards, it's a page turner. Buy it without hesitation. You'll be glad you did."
5,love it,This is a must if you love garlic! Perfect roasted garlic in 27 minutes!! BUY IT AND YOU TOO WILL LOVE IT.
1,Not a MIU France product!,"I just received this stainless steel oil can, which has a mirrored finished, a few days ago and was shocked to find it's not even a MIU product. In comes in a generic type box and all you can find out about it is that it was made in China. Of course most kitchen products are and so are all those made by MIU that I currently own, but it's ridiculous that this product is listed as a MIU France product when it clearly is not. So much for paying more for the name; I'd go with a lesser brand at a better price than paying more for something like this. The style of it is nice but the top lid has no seal and is not very tight. Therefore you could never use it to shake any specially mixed oils up even if you cover the spout with your thumb. Overall: paid way too much for a product falsely listed by Amazon who should know more about the products they sell."
2,Better Looking in the Picture than In Person,"Along with the previous reviewer's observation that this is NOT an MIU product, I'd also like to comment on how light this can is. It has a cheap feel to it. While it was hardly inexpensive, it makes a case for spending the money at Williams-Sonoma and getting what you paid for."
1,Oil Drizzler,"I just received this oil drizzler, and wish I had read the previous opinions first. It is very lightweight, no tight seal and not an MIU product. I returned it and went to Williams Sonoma to buy the real thing."
1,So Much For Beauty,"Buyer beware! We unboxed this beautiful MIU France oil can, set it up in our kitchen, and poured in our olive oil. The oil kept on flowing--out! All over our cookbooks and counter. I will see if I can get any compensation for the loss of the books, but I will demand my money back. Most of all, I am surprised that Amazon would endorse a distributor that pawns off defective merchandise as premium."
3,Very stylish can,My wife was very happy with this oil can. My only complaint is that there is no way to seal the spout.
2,VISUAL BASIC 6 BIBLE,This is a very general reference and will not help the typically beginner accomplish any real programming. I would recommend the microsoft step-by-step book instead.
5,excellent,"there is usually only one example for each topic but the example covers everything, and it is for intermediate to advanced users"
2,"Plenty of Content, but not enough detail....","The book is huge, and probably covers everything that Visual Basic can do. However, the book does not really go into enough detail on each subject. For example: The section on creating reports in VB6 covers maybe 4 pages. The book may have been better had the authors concentrated on the latest enhancements!"
2,there are too useless examples,the author tried to explain in real situations how to apply the vb6. the problem is that there are many examples that you could find in any other book as introduction of VB. so I don't know where the name 'Bible' comes from.
2,Not very Good,This book has the right idea about what topics to cover but doesn't cover them in depth enough. Also the editing is HORRIBLE. For instance they talk about how great ADO is but yet seem to use DAO for everything....Seems lazy to me. Also If you get stuck on any code....its probably wrong in the book. The CD at least has the right code.
1,outdated code,I would not recommend this book for any reason. As I followed the code in creating these projects I encountered numerous bugs. No updates are made available for the code in this book. The bugs occur because of this books dependancies on Visual Basic 5 components. This is rather poor for a book that touts itself as being the Bible for Visual Basic 6. Authors and editors should take the time to at least be sure to use the same components included in the version of VB that they are supposedly supporting.I would reccomend the John Smiley series of books instead. At least his code works and makes for a much more enjoyable read as well.
1,Worthless doorstop,"If you want screenshots and useless code and tutorials telling you to ""click the ComboBox tool, then click to place your ComboBox,"" you might like this book. For my part, I prefer SUBSTANCE not screenshots and wizard-like walkthroughs.Put it this way: if you think that a book telling people to click on the Start menu is a good way to teach Windows, you'd like this book. If you want to know more details, forget it. Look elsewhere and save the trees. The online help that comes with Visual Basic is *way* more useful, both as a reference and as an introduction -- even if you are completely new to programming. For those reviewers that rated the book highly (notice they are all new to programming) I would suggest that, had you used the Help menu, you would have learned faster. I doubt any experienced programmer would disagree with this opinion."
1,Poorly edited!,"I tried to follow this book to retrain myself. Unfortunately, the authors or editors did a very poor job of checking for continuity. Forms created in one section were referred to by a different name in the next section where they were used, menu items required in the code were not added in the menu definitions and code sections that the book indicate you should already have added do not exist in the text.The only thing that save this book from being a total loss was the fact that all code was available on the enclosed CD where missing information could be found."
4,Naration a matter of taste but timeless material,The narator is not one of my favorite Blackstone narators but that seems more a matter of personal taste. The content/translation of the material is where the value lies in this recording. Xenophon's tact and humor in telling this legendary tale makes it poetry as much as history and the narator gives it a good rendition.
4,ROMP AND STOMP,This is the book that inspired all the swash-buckler adventures. A true escape coutresy good old boy XENOPHON...LOTS OF FUN
4,"Excellent, But Not the Best","Xenophon's compelling narrative should be required reading for history buffs, and this (Rex Warner) translation of that story is good, but, for the general reader, I don't think it's the best. The dearth of explanatory footnotes is a real shortcoming for the non-expert.I think that the 2005 Robin Waterfield translation (titled ""The Expedition of Cyrus"") in the Oxford World's Classics paperback series, with a helpful chronology and large set of explanatory endnotes, is a better choice for most people. I also believe that Waterfield's literary style is more engaging than Warner's, but -- probably -- not everyone will agree."
3,"Very Good Pictures, Not enough text.","In this book, each president had two pages- 1 with their picture...the other with thier information. The pictures were really great, but the information was brief in content. If you're looking to learn something, this book would not help very much. Most of the text contained is already known by most people. It may be suitable for ten year olds, but for adults, it wouldn't be as interesting because all it contains is pictures and a short paragraph. Although, It would be a great book for kids, it just doesn't go good with ""history buffs."""
2,Shame on U,"Nicholas Best, Shame on you! I liked the book, except... You did not have the full names (middle names) of the presidents! Now thats weird. VaVoom SoKKo"
4,Scarey initial reaction,"When this recording started I was wondering what was wrong with my balance on my system. The production on the first track must have been done by a drummer. Overkill on the drums drowns out an easily overwhelmed voice of the man, JJ Cale. What a relief when the second track reverted to a familiar mix that highlighted Cale's guitar and voice. Really great guitar work on this one, making the title appropriate. However for this fan it's the feel of Cale's recordings that soothes my soul. Great stuff."
3,For Cale fans,"If you like J.J. Cale, you'll enjoy this. Not his best work but a fine addition to your collection if you're his fan like my husband and I are."
2,!,"Why pay this much for a weak recording when you can get a domestic copy for less. Some of the compositions are a welcome addition to Cale's considerable songbook. Others are not. It is the production that buries this disc. There is an unfortunate reliance on Drum machines throughout. The ""beats"" prove to be an unwanted distraction to what could have been a strong recording. Cale still has his guitar chops but could have benefited with sticking to his clean strat tone as he is overproduced here as well. Go with anything up to 1980's Shades. After that he began to succumb to ill-fitting production work which eventually began to spoil his recordings. Give this one a pass...Simon"
4,jjcale fan,"You either love JJ or you don't. I love his music. I bought this cd for one song - Low Down. Absolutely dynamite. Overall, a typically good JJ Cale cd."
5,A strong studio album from JJ Cale,...I think this album is stylisticly coherent and is a fun one to listen to. The production is good by JJ Cale standards and the music is strong.
4,Great portable table but...,We have purchsed 14 of these portable tables for our Engineering Company total. Our engineers take them with then to customer sites and use them for their computers/laptops while programming. If you are a computer programmer or anything that requires you to be in cramped spaces for a long time understand.They are great little tables. Lightweight and portable. They fold up real small and are easily opened. If anything breaks it is a bit difficult to find replacement parts. But the price is right so you can easily replace them. We bought 10 in 2007 and only 3 have broken or needed replacement.
5,Eric Carle never lets me down!,I read this book to my students in honor of Labor Day. It is a touching tale with amazing illustrations!
5,Nike watch,My wife loves it. She wants a second one - so i guess i know what I'm going to get her for her birthday! No...not JUST the watch. I'm a better hubby than that!
2,I must've missed the magic,"I realize I'm alone on this one, so I don't think my voice will be heard very well against the crowds saying otherwise, but I didn't find this book to be very useful. I was so excited when I first got it because I've heard nothing but good things about it, but I was unfortunately dissappointed. It's really more of a history and recollection of ""the good ol' days"" told by two brilliant animators, but, in my honest opinion, it lacked very much the ""how to"" part of animation. I'm all for learning from the experiences of others, but after reading the book cover to cover I can't say I'll be a better animator for it."
4,Don't get this book -,"if you are only interested in a how-to book, because that's not what its intended to be, especially now with cell animation being pushed out by CG. What it is a history of Disney even down to the everyday details of the process that created the movies we only know as the final production.If you want a book, that will help you expand your 'creative thinking' and give ideas about building concepts, then you should find this book to be helpfull."
4,Beware The Current Edition...,"It's a great book loaded with pertinent information for animators. Still, this edition is a reprint of a COPY of the original, as the negatives for the artwork collected in the original edition were lost. Thus, the current edition has extremely poor color quality."
5,"First Class Reference---easy to read, informative","The two Authors of ""The nine old men"" knew what went on at Disney Studios. ""A Prime source, you just can't read a better source than these authors! Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston's expertise, honored by the American Film Institute and other prestigious resourceszz; guide you through the characters in many animation movies; job descriptions of departments in the making of these movies, steps in animating a scence, ingredieants of a scene, principles of animation, story, character development, animating expressions and dialogue and more.""Buy the book---no reservations""---the worst that can happen, you return the book to amazon.Carl Santy.C.S."
5,The essential book For ALL animators,"Im a computer animator. Even though this book is about traditional animation, it has been invaluable to me. It is without doubt THE book about animation and what to do. Even if your not a fan of Disney animation, this is still the best book there is. They made animation what it is today, and there is no one better to learn from."
1,Not a good source for animators,"I bought this book and opened it thinking that it wil be the strong version of The Animator Survival Kit, then after just 5 minutes I realized that it was a serial loose of my money because it not worth the money I paid. It has nothing that helps you to animate , is just the story of some Disney old animated movies. And the rest of it is to read a full scale of bla, bla, bla, bla that don't help in anything. But if you are a collector of Disney old stories it will be ok, so before buy it just think if you wanna draw to animate or just collect a big & heavy book with a Disney name on it."
5,Truly the BEST I've ever read,"I've never thought that this book can be as wonderful as it is. As a prospective animator, it was really useful to read it at the beginning of my studies, because it took me to the right direction. It takes animation so serious as I hoped. Unfortunately it hasn't been released in Hungarian, so I couldn't read it in my native language, but luckily it is easy to understand in English too.It worths the money, because this is a handbook, that you don't read only once, but can be used anytime when it needed.The Illusion of Life tells about everything: the theory, the process, and also the people behind all this magic.It is absolutely wonderful!!"
5,For All the Goddesses Out There,"I am in awe of this deck of cards. The artwork is EXTREMELY beautiful! The book is helpful for a beginner of Goddess Cards. I am very experienced with tarot, but have found a deeper appreciation in the Goddess Cards. All readings I have done so far...whether they were for myself or a friend, have been DEAD on! I've also learned a lot about my Goddess within and who I am. I reccommend this to everyone!"
4,Lifetime backboard and rim combo,"Easy to assemble, adapted easily to our original pole and bracket; comes with springs if you want to add for extra ""slamming"" spring!"
5,Basketball,My nephew loves this new backboard was just what I expected. Product is great value for the price you pay.
2,Requires more than what's ordered,"This backboard seems well made, but I had to buy an additional mounting bracket & bolts to mount this. Also, it is extremely heavy, so I cannot mount it on my garage, which is where I wanted it. Going to return it & buy one already mounted on a pole."
2,Not very well made,"The lids for these egg coddlers are poorly made. Its difficult to get them on and off when they're cold, and when they're hot its even trickier. We've only used them a few times, but I suspect that after a few more times the lids will become useless. On the plus side, you can easily put two eggs in one coddler."
1,Porcelain Egg coddler is defective,purchased a pair and used the second one for the first tiome and the top was in two pieces -- the welding of the top piece to the cap is defective----and this happend 1 week after the return deadline!
5,VERY SATISFIED,"These chairs are very well constructed, light weight, and easy to use. Very portable - The side table is an added bonus. Great for toting to ""happy hours"" in the neighborhood. The delivery time on our order was outstanding. We were quoted a delivery time of 5-9 days and they arrived in 3 or 4 with no shipping charges."
5,great chair,I currently have 2 of these chairs. They are sturdy and stable. The fold-up table is really handy.
5,Rugged performer,"I have been taking this camping for over two years now & it is still holding up very well. I honestly expected to set this up and have a rock bend one of the legs at some time. It hasn't happened yet! I have friends here in western Colorado that go camping every weekend who bought one of these chairs after I did, they are still using them every weekend.This is a good one, considering I used to always look for heavy duty steel folding chairs! Look for them on sale and enjoy the little side table where you can put your beverage & cigar along with a book."
4,Coleman deck chair,I purchased two of these chairs for my daughter and her boyfriend.They were happy with them and said they were durable. I looked atothers but am happy I stayed with a good brand name. I'm sure they'llget many years of use out of the chairs.
5,Coleman Portable Deck Chair,"It is a really great chair. I took it camping this weekend. The table could be a little bigger, but it still worked out great. The chair really is comfortable and light to carry. The only thing that disappointed me was, these chairs I have seen in the stores have a several pocket pouch on the arm on the opposite side of the table. I do love this chair."
5,Well Crafted,This toe ring is another well crafted item from Silver Insanity. It's very beautiful and solid. The delivery was fast and the service was excellent.
3,Beautiful product,"The ring is beautiful in itself! But I found it a little on the small side! The service was great though, I got the ring in no time at all!"
5,Love this Toe Ring!!,This toe ring is awesome! I was really surprised at how nice it looks - even better than the picture. This in no way looks like a $3.99 toe ring. This looks much better than my other ones that I have paid over $20 for. I liked it so much I just ordered another one! HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a quality looking toe ring! No one would ever guess you paid under $5 for it.
5,Nice comfortable ring,"Bought this ring for my wife, and she absolutely loves it. Very comfortable, and solid looking piece of jewelry."
4,Amusing,"I read this selection of stories in 3 days on the bus home from school. The ride seemed very short and I was reluctant to get off at my stop. So there had to be something good in these cat mystery shorts. My favourites included ""The Beast Within"" for it's excellent ending and ""The Black Cat"" for it's increasing paranoia. Some stories were just plain bad like the one from Lilian Braun. Read it and you'll see what I mean. I guessed the ending way before it came and it was a bit of a let down. This is for anyone who likes cat and mystery stories."
3,"To big for the features, but the sound is great.","The sound of this product is great.The looks are also good but the is nothing that gives you the motivation to say ""WAOH"".The remote control is also very big, looks like a house stereo remote.The good thing is that it comes Sirius Ready."
4,"Great sound, double din integrates well","Pros:Elegant design, (simply, not too flashy)Double din integrates well with factory lookWMA/MP3 SupportAmazing sound from integrated amp (I always run a 4-channel MTX or JL amp, but the integrated one here sounds great)AUX in (I use my droid/iphone often to play grooveshark or google music.Cons:Trim it yourself bezel doesn't work out as well as it soundsNo blue-tooth"
2,Good & Bad Points,"It looks good once it's together. However, it scratches very easily during assembly. Also, one of the top moldings was longer than the other two so it did not fit. So of course, while I was trying to get it between the gable moldings, quite a few scratches were made. I have since e-mailed the manufacturer & requested a replacement part. Again, it does look good once assembled once you use the included color marker pen to hide the scratches. But I do not think it is worth the money. Maybe about half that."
5,"Excellent value, fun kit!","Seems to be a quality product, especially for the price. Unlike some of the other raters, I read the description and knew this was a kit, the project lasted about 10 hours and the instructions were great! I would seriously recommend getting a solder sucker if you don't have one, mistakes are easy to make. There is one important thing to note! The instructions tell the user to compare the output to another accurate multimeter at multiple points to test the device and calibrate the variable resistors. I don't have one, but I was able to get it decently calibrated by using common voltage sources, a AA battery, a 5V and 12V power cable, and home voltage."
3,For School,"This multimeter is NOT ASSEMBLED! This means you will have to SOLDER it!Now that that is out of the way, I am an Electrical Engineer major and for one of our class assignments we have to piece together fully functioning mid/high level circuit board kits. THAT is what this is for. It does a great job for what it says it does. While this is not Fluke multimeter, and as such it is not as durable as one, it works just fine for such class projects."
1,Lesson Learned.Order locally.,"`I thought I was ordering a product , not a kit. As soon as I opened the box I realized my error. At 81 years of age I am not abouit to take up electric kit assembly. I have tried to find a school or organization to donate the kit. No luck,"
2,Who allowed this?,"Oh no no no. My friend Mel always tells me brown and black do not mix, and she knows fashion. Who allowed this? However for 8.50, at least you can tell the fashion police you got a good deal."
5,"Haunting, informative","Though I believe Marilyn Monroe committed suicide, I found this video (which captures Marilyn's last days) very informative: it stands as a testament to how powerful men can take advantage of women (as JFK and RFK seem to have done with Marilyn). Sometimes angering, sometimes depressing, this video is essential to understanding the downfall of an American icon. Those critical to the premise that Marilyn had affairs with both Robert and John Kennedy will find it hard to deny the affairs in the face of the plentiful interviews and evidence in this movie."
2,A Featureless Review of Marilyn's Last Days,"This documentary covers Marilyn Monroe's last days and focuses on her links to John and Bobby Kennedy. Unfortunately, with just one exception, the players in this story (particularly the narration) appear to be bored with the whole affair. The lighting is too dark and the music sounds like it came from a 1960's stag film. For the MM cognoscenti, very little new information is presented. The highlight of the film is the riveting testimony of Deborah Gould, who was the ex-wife of Peter Lawford. Even though she was probably just 10 years old in the early 1960's when all of this took place, she is as stunning as she is believable."
2,Pass on this one!,"This tape has actually very little footage of Marilyn, the rest is just more of the same old, tired murder conspiracy. I think this tape confuses things more than it clears up. People have to realize that a lot of money is being made writing books and stuff about all these different theories, very little can actually be backed up with facts. It is truly a shame. Don't bother with this one"
2,Get Hang On To A Dream: The Verve Recordings Instead,"It has more music and it is now much, much cheaper. (Which is to say that it has this CD plus a whole disc of extras.) You like more for cheaper, don't you?"
2,Bird Cage Stand,"I ordered the bird cage stand, but it was missing some key parts to assemble it which were not enclosed. I contacted the seller, and STILL have not received these parts.I'm unable to use the stand at this time. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
3,Nothing too exciting,"It does exactly what it's intended for: to hold a bird cage. I've had this for 3 years and I haven't had any problems with it. See my reviews to see what kind of cage I've had used with this stand. It's black-coated wire mesh. It doesn't seem too sturdy though. Every time I walk by and walk into the cage, it shakes pretty hard, sending the water splashing. But then again, I tend to walk into the cage pretty hard sometimes. The top of the stand reaches to about an average counter-top height."
3,It was Okay,"I like the Sweet Vally Junior High Series but this wasn't one of my favorite books. It was... okay. It was all about Anna and how she ditches Salvador and Elizabeth to hang with her new friends with drama. She starts acting really different... like dying her hair and missing Zone meetings which is typically un-Anna. I thought the plot was kind of boring, even though I usually like the plots with Salvador, Elizabeth and Anna."
3,ehh...it could have been better,"I didn't really like the book.Anna died her hair bright red, forgot about all the Zone meetings, and even though she has a bunch of new friends, she's still the same, insecure Anna.Instead of a magazine, the Zone goes on the web, with the disapproval of Salvador.Anna is probably my least favorite character because she over-obsesses about her dead brother Tim, and she's just plain boring.I also don't like the way they all call it a 'zine instead of a magazine, it had me confused for a while and I was wondering what it was.buy it if u want, im not so glad i did"
2,poor performance,"very disappointed with this product...couldnt hold a charge, bad range, not clear audio.a mistake on my part to purchase"
5,Great gift!,I gave this to someone as a Christmas gift and they loved it. They call me from it all the time! Highly recommend.
5,Excellent Purchase,"In a world of bewildering electronic options, our selection of this particular Panasonic product proved to be a wise purchase - simple to useand access messages."
3,Not as good as I had hoped...,"We had another Panasonic phone with an answering system... it was several years old and needed to be replaced. I bought this one to replace it, but it doesn't have the features that the last one had, and I miss them. For example, the phone base doesn't have a speaker phone option (just the phone itself.) So, if I can't find the phone, I can't just press speaker phone on the base to talk to someone. (With the kids at home, I usually can't find the phone.) Also, the sound isn't as clear as the last one was... but it is still much clearer than any other brand cordless phone that I've owned. Panasonic is definitely the best in terms of sound clarity. The caller-id is only on the phone, not on the base... so again, if i can't find the phone, i don't know who is calling. My last one also had the caller id on the base. All in all, the phone is ok. But, I miss my old panasonic."
4,A Fine Phone/Answerer Combo With One Issue.,"The high ratings are justified, however there's one shortcoming; one's outgoing message on the answerer is not as loud or clear enough as it should be when heard by the calling party. Some callers find it hard to understand."
4,I'm pretty picky about phones...,"I had returned two other cordless phones before settling on this one. The reception is good enough that I can walk out of the apartment, repark my car and walk back without dropping a call. The shape of the phone is a little awkward to hold on one's shoulder and the microphone on the handset is very directional so if I'm not holding it exactly right, the voice quality sounds a little distant.For the price and the options on the phone, it was well worth it."
4,Phone has worked well for a long time,"We have owned this phone for 4 years without any problems. It is very easy to use, with a good range outside the house, easy to hear. You can increase the speaker volume for the answering machine; when someone calls and leaves a message, we can hear who it is from another room. There are 2 contradictory reviews on whether you can add handsets. You cannot, according to the Panasonic technical specs at [...], so it is just a one-handset phone."
1,total junk,"This phone broke completely in just over 1 year, just over the warranty limit. This is hardly the first time that a Panasonic phone was defective, but this time I've learned my lesson - no more Panasonic anything."
4,Panasonic KX-TG5631S 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange Digital Cordless Answering System,"I bought a refurb unit for $44.99, including shipping and tax, and I am VERY pleased. Yes, it would be nice if it came with a clip, even though it has divets on each side for one, but the reception is awesome. It would be nice if the address book was bigger too, so choose wisely if you need to store a lot of numbers."
4,Great cordless phone,"It's a great cordless phone...value for money. It has very good voice clarity & is feature rich.Keypad is not illuminated though which may cause some trouble in low light condition. Also, one needs to reset the date & time everytime if the base gets disconnected for any reason."
1,Very bad battery life,"Phone is excellent. No doubts about it. It has all the bells and whistles.But the battery life is too bad. In just 5 months, the battery is dead and no longer recharges. A spare battery cost me $12 at Radioshack. I thought that the factory battery was already old and expected the new battery to last longer. But even the new battery is already showing sigs of age in just 1 month.I found out from my other friends that they are having problems wiht their Panasonic phones too (other models).So please don't buy this phone unless you don't mind spending a fortune on batteries."
5,Satisfied,"Getting a new phone made me realize how outdated my previous one had become. Reception is good all over the house and there's no interference with my wireless network. User controls are intuitive. I even set up a different ring tone. I'm usually pretty slow adapting to new techie devices, but I was up and running quickly. It's a fun phone, with selectable color lights when it gets an incoming call."
5,For your health,"Excellent book for learning how to preserve foods the old way without chemicals and harmful preservatives. One of the many steps to help prevent cancer, heart disease, diabetas, artherites, and many other killers."
5,Quality,"First time ever using bees wax candles, so I have nothing to compare to. I must say I am very impressed with these and the quality. Very happy with purchase."
3,Perhaps 3.75 stars?,"Entertaining a move to Boston, I bought this book on a whim. It's a nice guide and will give you a general overview, but I wanted more meat. I suppose I'd be in a better position to judge had I actually moved at this point. It does give some nice information by neighborhood, so you could theoretically find a dry cleaner/coffee shop/hardware store your first week in town if you needed to. A little too much of the book (for my taste) was devoted to moving basics...like a packing timeline, etc. I already know this stuff or would consult UHaul if I didn't...I would rather have had more Boston info in the book. The writer clearly loves the city and is proud to share it, and isn't afraid to discuss the city's foibles (traffic, parking and high -- really high -- cost of living). If you're looking to move to Boston, I'd buy this in tandem with another book or two -- just to make sure you're getting everything you need."
3,"Surprise, contains corn","I'm sure this vinegar is delicious, judging from the other reviews. But because Amazon doesn't have a policy of disclosing all food ingredients, and because of corn allergy in the family, and because I didn't research it offsite before buying, I now have six bottles of vinegar I can't use.For future reference for those who might need to know, here are the ingredients as listed on the Heinz Gourmet Malt Vinegar bottle label:Malt vinegar (barley, corn malt), diluted with water to 5% acidity."
3,"Too comprehensive and detailed, still somewhat interesting","If you are an academic, or in love with the subject matter, you'll love this book. However, Bain goes into so much detail, and brings in so many characters, and jumps around so much that I found it hard to follow. I made it through the first 200 pages, but then just lost my interest, because I couldn't keep track of it all. Maybe you're smarter than me and will be able to do so. The book just didn't read like a novel to me, more like a detailed police investigation at times."
1,"Dry and dusty, like the Plains it once conquered.","Only zealous history buffs will relate to this work. Written by a historian who, apparently, has a penchant for facts and none for prose."
2,Where's the Prospectus?,"I just completed the reading, or should I say,excavating, the contents of The Empire Express. I believe the subheading for the book should have been ""Financing the First Transcontinental Railroad."" Earlier reviewers have bemoaned the lack of such items as definitive maps and a cast of characters. I second these concerns. What saddens me about the book is that it could have been so much better if the author had focused on the people on the ground who actually built the two railroads. Financing this undertaking was, of course, a major endeavor, but the author's focus on the minutiae of the financial deals killed the narative. This material would have been better placed in an appendix or as Will Durant did, with the early volumes of his History of Civilization, in reduced font. I've always been fascinated by this period in American history, and I was expecting much more from this book."
3,"Good history, but lacking references for non-US people","This book certainly goes into the detail and provides a fascinating insight into the machinations (good and bad) which went on behind the scenes to help in the construction of this great line.I would recommend it for anyone interested in the history of this great project.One complaint - lack of maps or other way of working out the relevant progress of the two ends of the line. I certainly lost track from about the middle of the book. I guess it might be easier if you know the geography of the States reasonably well, but the inclusion of a simple map every chapter would help put the text in context.Other than that I would recommend it. Perhaps it could be read in conjunction with an atlas of US railroads."
2,"Scholarly, but too heavy on financing and politics","I have to admire the author's scholarship. He covers in minute detail all of the Congressional and company machinations, and the role of an extensive cast of characters. However, by halfway through, I was wishing there was more description of the Irish and Chinese laborers life and work, as well as the engineering and construction problems that were encountered and solved. In short, this has to be the definitive book on the trans-Continental railroad planning, financing and politics, but I wished I could have visualized the physical construction and the nature of the country better."
1,Hercules was forced to take a shower,"A fire from the sky drops near by Samara. It deposits something evil. This evil horde demands human sacrifice. The queen of Samara (Jany Clair) is in cahoots with the evil ones in exchange for a chance to rule the world.Only one man can save them by leading a revolt. Yep it is Hercules (Sergio Ciani.) I suspect the queen could smell Hercules and ordered a shower. Evidently it did not work so she will try to make Herc take a powder, and he would be mooning over her.Looks like another full moon and time for a sacrifice when the sound is turned off it looks like they are all going to the showers. Will Herc help? If you look close Herc looks like Bob Vila of this old house fame, only a tad smellier.O.K. one more time lets try sand blasting him.Let my people go.Muscle Madness"
1,Ridiculous!,"This movie is a poorly done satire on Christian life in a Christian school. I've taught in Christian schools and the movie is simply RIDICULOUS! Also, I'd like to see a satire done on another religion; people would get sued. Christians are a free for all!"
1,A WASTE,"What a waste. ""SAVED"" is such a bad movie that I couldn't even finish watching it. It was so sac-religious. Not only that but the movie has no real plot and seemed like it was written for 5th graders. It was clearly an attempt to make fun of christianity and presents a very false view at that. Don't bother wasting your time on this movie."
1,Sick,"Biased, there's no argument about it.saved! mocks Christianity and tries to justify doing so with a half-hearted hypocritical message.But keep in mind this is still a teen film and treated as such to draw and appeal to the target audience.The basic plot is predictable (a terrible structure and conclusion) and the acting is poor. The dialogue is often rushed by the young actors and at times barely audible, a result of amature film making.Realize that this is a product that was marketed to you and nothing more than that. You were exploited by Hollywood."
5,"God must've loved this movie, because I sure did!","I love movies that are Christian/Comedies...but not movies that make fun of God. ""Saved!"", is one of them! I'm down with G.O.D.!!"
3,not too good,"This film has a great premise and I was really looking forward to it, but the plot wears thin and the script is boring. I'm disappointed. This had potential but it didn't pan out. The acting is fine but the script and plot are underdeveloped and I was yawning and fidgeting by the end.The extras are nice, including two commentary tracks, bloopers, outtakes, 11 deleted scenes and a trailer. The film can be heard in English and subtitled in English, French or Spanish.Too bad."
5,One of my top 10,"I have gone to cherch all my life and I some times think that people forget that the bible says love thy neighbor as thy self. This film did not affend me any way because it is after all a work of fiction, but it did show me that god truely does love all,and that he has a sense of humor. if you like saved I would recomend Kevin smith's dogma."
3,Light hearted farce.,"Probably will be offensive to some, absolutely hilarious in parts to others. It satirizes religious teachers trying to be hip, and Christianity as practiced by the dreadfully earnest but bubble gummy, air-headed, and mean-spirited, as well as the well-intentioned, confused, and bitter.Saved! Breezes through exaggerated teen dramatic stereotypes- pregnancy, coming out, and high school snobbery through a superficially Christian view. The plot is a little predictable in parts but normal for the genre, and a little too sappy for my taste, especially towards the end."
4,Wonderful and enlightening!,Alright this movie might be a little quirky...but it has an awesome message...It is hard to live up to the perfect image of Jesus even if you are the best Christian you can be. That is what Mary learns in this movie. I rented this movie not knowing what in the heck it was about and I am sure glad I did because it made me think about how so many people try to live the perfect lives and some times things just don't work out how you plan them...It is the only part that Mandy Moore has played that I did not like...she is a bit annoying in this movie...but the other people are great!
3,funny but weird,I saw this movie a long time ago and thought it was pretty entertaining so I decided to buy it
1,"Sorry, but it is anti- christian","Some of the other reviews are laughable, like ""This movie is not anti-Christian, as many people say. It just mocks them"".What do you think mocking is? Being for it? Of course its anti christian. And talking about open mindedness how about making a movie mocking other religions? This movie is just another example of the Intolerence shown to christians in america."
5,As The Tag-Line Reads...Get Saved!,"This film is one of the best of the year! Jena Malone shines as the semi-innocent Mary who does what she thinks God wants her to do in order to save her boyfriend from being gay. However, it doesn't work, and Mary is now pregnant. This film is not only a great drama, but a good comedy as well! Mandy Moore gives the best performance of her career as the evil, yet with good intentions Hilary Faye. The film is a breath of fresh air with a take on Christianity and life all it's own! As the tagline says...get Saved!"
3,Blunted satire,"The film fall shorts of its own promising ambitions; maybe a producer interfered.It starts off with wicked satire and insight ('I've been born again all my life') into American evangelical culture, but it loses its edge as it falls prey to the middle ground, to affirming a vague liberal message of 'living and let live'. The issues are not followed through; the lure of the teen comedy genre starts to overwhelm it, and the script is not so concerned with satirising this part of American culture.It's still a good film. Its strength is its understanding of the comic potential in evangelical culture, its smug certainties and hidden darker sides. (And I say this as an evangelicalish Anabaptist).Jenna Malone is sweet; Mandy Moore is perfectly hateable."
3,I really wanted to like this movie,This movie had a lot of unrealized potential.The idea for the story was great and the writing showed brilliance at times. The beginning of the year pep rally for God was a very well done scene.But in many parts the film dragged and the funny one liners and scenes were generally held together by some stiff performances and some less than great scenes.Still I recommend the movie because I think it is thought provoking about the way we view religion and who is religious.
5,"Too true, too true","It takes a lot of balls to make a movie like this, reason being that you have to have experienced such radical ""Christianism"" to really get it like this movie got it. You who didn't grow up this way might see it and think, ""Yeah right, they're just playing it up because it's a movie,"" but I kid you not, this is how it is when you're a Christian teenager.That said, this movie is not just a comedy, especially if you've gone through teenage Christiandom. I cried. I admit it. I cried because the ending was happy, and the ending would not be happy in real life. I cried because if any professing Christian saw this movie, they'd dismiss it as sacreligious bunk, and completely lose the message. I cried because the message was that Jesus still loves you, even if you're gay or weird or handicapped or even fundamentalist, but I'm not so sure it's true.See it and judge for yourself."
2,An Overdrawn Charicature,"Has some funny parts but is mostly a charicature of a small segment of conservative Christians, and so not a great satire."
1,Hated this movie!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It's offending to christians. All this movie does is make fun of us. I have lost all respect for Mandy Moore and all of the actors and people involved in this movie most of all the person who wrote this movie!! It's stupid,not funny,pointless,offending...I could go on and on about this movie. Overall it was just awful and as for the people involved,it sucks that they would make such a stupid movie. I guess!! Well,this was just my opinion."
1,Let's Make a Film That Stereotypes Atheists Next!,"This film is so much based on stereotypes, it's not even funny. I bet if a Christian made a film that portrayed Muslims or atheists as stupid weaklings who have to have everything right, they would be shunned away from Hollywood and their movie would get as many bad critic reviews as Carter has pills. If you barely know about Christianity and are a really shallow person, you'll enjoy Saved!, but if you're actually intelligient and you know a thing or two about modern Christianity , this movie will dissapoint. One of these days Christians are going to make a movie that makes atheists be a pun of a bad joke, and I bet Hollywood will cry its tears out and whine that the film is too controversial, but make a film like Saved! and you get praised like a king from here to Hawaii."
1,Not balanced,"As a Christian I fully realize that American Christian culture could well deserve some biting satire. But this story is way out of balance, more a caricature of this culture. If you think Christians are unhappy, repressed, narrow, hypocritical, unable to deal with reality and, yes, homophobic, then you will like this movie. Those who reject fundamentalist christianity, and embrace drunkeness, adultery and, yes, homosexuality, are shown as happy and best able to deal with reality. If you believe that, you will enjoy this movie."
4,Sort of John Waters' Interperates the Bible,"""Saved"" is not for everyone. It is funny, sweet, sad, and quite enjoyable to watch. It is not to be taken seriously, and has some very clever moments. Bible thumpers with no sense of humor or the real world need to stay away. Yes, the kids do some bad things, but there is some morality in this film. It deals with teen pregnacy, homosexuality, and passing judgement of others. These kids however, do want to do the next right thing. Like real kids its not always clear what it is.Great cast. Mandy Moore is a stitch as the bible princess. The direction flows fast, the screenplay is biting and honest. A good time if you have an open mind. If not, this is not your cup of tea."
4,Hysterical! I can totally relate!,This was the best movie that makes fun of christianity ever. I go to a christian school and it is almost exactly the same.
4,speaks very truthfully,"Despite what many people say, this show isn't just a ploy to deface Christians. Not only am I Christian, but I went to a Catholic HS and was not offended by the material. My born-again brother watched it, and while I thought the high school christian scene was overdone, he felt it embodied a few of the younger members of his own church! He liked it as much as me. There are extremes in every religion, and this film shows the obsuridity of taking one's beliefs to the verge of condemning others; or one's self. Christianiy just has the broadest base, so more people can relate. I loved the lesson the movie gives, and that of love that should be found in us all. If this movie proves anything, it's that we sin the most when we think we've committed none. I loved it and recommend it completely."
5,Awesome,It's been a while since I've seen this movie but I do remember that it's awesome. I definitely recommend. :)
4,Blows mean girls out of the water,"Saved is one of the best comedies to come around in a while. Jena Malone is her usual wonderful self, as she copes with her newfound pregnancy and the discovery that her boyfriend is gay. Mandy Moore is pretty ordinary here, playing the evil popular girl trying to ruin their friendship and ""converting"" Jena to God. This movie was very funny and Eva Amurri was surprisingly good as the rebel. I thought it showed more about how girls act than mean girls and it had a sense of humor about it. Highly recommended!"
5,I've been saved,"Recently I saw Saved at the NB film festival. I was a little skeptical about it, because I am not a huge fan of Mandy Moore. I was wrong. This was an excellent movie. It was genuinely hilarious. It also had a serious side to it that was very thoughtful. This is an excellent movie and I recommend for everyone to see it. The actors were extremely talented and real, especially for such young people. Saved also had a great soundtrack. Don't pay attention to the reviews saying it is horribly stereotypical! It doesn't matter what religion you are. I love this movie. Go see Saved!!!!!"
2,Underachieved,"someone else wrote:""This film has a great premise and I was really looking forward to it, but the plot wears thin and the script is boring. I'm disappointed. This had potential but it didn't pan out. The acting is fine but the script and plot are underdeveloped and I was yawning and fidgeting by the end. ""no need to rewrite it, it's on point"
1,I hated this movie...,"""Saved!"" was the only movie I *really* wanted to see this summer. It looked funny, and was soppoused to be different from most teen-acted comedies. I even went to see it the night it came out in theaters. After a half an hours time, I knew that it wasn't worth the hype. I wanted badly to leave, but forced myself to keep watching, thinking it *might* get better. It just got worse and worse, and more like a cheesy, everyday teen comedy. The climax even takes place at the big seinor prom. It wasn't funny, either. I don't think I laughed once. The annoying cast of charectors made it all the more worse. Despite my hate of it, I *must* defend it on one point; it's NOT meant to mock Christianity all together. It's meant to mock Chritians who take thier religion out of hand. I noticed that many of the people who have given this a one-star rating all comment on how it makes fun of Christianity, and I want to know; have you ever actually *seen* this movie???"
4,I liked it but...,"I really did like this movie but it was advertised as a comedy. If you saw the commercials, you saw the only 2 funny parts of the whole movie. If you like high school love stories then you will like this movie, if you're looking to laugh try elsewhere."
5,GET SAVED!!!,This movie is sooooooo worth the money. A hilarious but touching film that brings out the best in everyone. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!?? GO GET SAVED!!!!!
2,I cannot believe all the praise for this movie!,"I watched this movie based on a friend's reccomendation. Although in many ways a clever movie with a clever premise, it never came close to escaping the inevitable, degenerating into a pile of cliches and even a brand of dumbed-down moralism. Unfortunately, this isn't the kind of film that would try to emphasize or understand those it makes fun of -- its just a teen movie."
4,save me,ok so I saw this movie. It was goood in that weird humor kind of way. MAC Culkin was classic. His halloween costum as a skate is classic. All the other characters pale in comparison.Despite all the sin in this movie everyone lives happily ever after hahaaha
3,Great lines and good cast,"I like this movie, it's quirky, original and downright funny. Sure it has some ""serious"" issues but you are laughing pretty much the entire movie. I have loved Patrick Fugit since almost famous and he does'nt dissapoint in this! Mandy Moore playing a not so nice character is also a nice change."
3,"Not bad, but not good either","I've been reading the reviews for this movie, and they have been the way I expected. When reading the reviews from fellow Chrisitians, I'm like wow, and we wonder why people make movies like this. As much as we've complained about the stereotypes all of our reviews have done nothing more than enforce them. We're condemning people for expressing their views, and honestly they aren't that far off. We all are at one time or another hypicritits, and zealots.The movie has nothing to do with Christ or his teachings, it's looking at the way we interpret them. I think so many of my brothers and sisters went to see the movie with their minds already made up.I think instead of condemning people for veiwing us this way, we need to examine ourselves and see why they see us this way. If we did this our ministries would be so much more fruitful, and so many more unbelievers would be ""Saved"".Remember let he who is without sin..."
3,Okay,"This movie was okay, not great, but I do enjoy Jena Malone regardless. I also enjoyed the humor which was low key."
4,Good comedy about the folly of faith,"Saved is a comedy about a young lady at a Christian high school who finds herself pregnant as a result of her efforts to save her gay boyfriend, and a friend of hers whose crippled brother is getting sick of relying on the charity of his self-righteous sister.The slightly wishy-washy ending doesn't overly dampen the message that the Bible isn't much of a moral guide. Best of all, it's very funny."
3,worth watching but not as edgy as it could be,This is a mildly entertaining film and certainly if you've attended a Christian school at some point in your life it really rings true. Saved's biggest fault is it wavers between scathing humor aimed at the hypocrisy of religion to schmaltzy feel good warm fuzzy moments. It's a minor distraction that takes some of the sting out of its bite. Culkin is okay as wheelchair bound Roland but he still sports his perpetual smirk made famous from his Home Alone movies. It's Eva Amurri who steals the show as the rebellious Jewish outcast Cassandra although her sudden sympathetic change of heart halfway through is a bit out of character. A fun and smart film but ultimately it fails to deliver nothing more than a couple lumps of processed sugar.
4,"A Funny, Satiric Little Film","Saved is actually quite good. It skewers the people who think (apparantly) like some of the reveiwers here, so I doubt it will enlighten anybody. In that sense, it preaches to the already converted. Beyond that, it has some very humorous moments and some fine performances. Mandy Moore is a hoot as the over-the-top Christian teen, Eva Ammuri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) is great as the ""bad girl"", and Donovan, Parker and Culkin are all fine in their roles. Produced by Michael Stipe (REM) it offers some good lessons about diversity and the realities of life. A little treacly at the end, but it is still well worth watching."
3,Not a toy,The questions above do not apply to this item it is far from a toy and no child should be allowed to have it. It is very colorful and tiny pieces so a child would have it in their mouth right away. That being said I am not that impressed with the item considering it's intended use. It is supposed to look like flowers on a model train layout. The yellow does appear to be dandelions when sprinkled in grass but unless I am mis-using it it really does not resemble flowers except by a very large stretch of the imagination. I have been using Woodland Scenics products exclusively on my layout and this is the ONLY product I am not satisfied with. Maybe someone with a little more expertise would have better luck.
2,"OK, but obsolete and heavy","The product works so far, but it's pretty much obsolete now. Meaning, everything now is LED powered, which are incredibly light and compact. This guy is bulky, very heavy (with the batteries and magnet), and the light is pretty dim. I have an LED flashlight which is powered by watch batteries that is far brighter than this light, and it is the size of a large pen. This light takes 4 AA batteries and still gives off a pretty dim light. And did I mention it's bulky and heavy?Hey, the light works, the magnet is strong, and it does the job, but I'll bet (if it already doesn't exist) someone will come out with an LED tent light that is far brighter and much less bulky. I'd recommend this light only for car camping and just for basic lighting needs, not for reading."
4,works as advertised...,"it is bright enough, runs off 4 AA batteries and has great battery life. I just wish i had done more research first, cuz for a few bucks more you can get one with a 50' range remote control. That was my fault though. But other than that gripe, this light definitely works, and has a VERY powerful magnet. Requires 2 people to mount/remove the light; one outside the tent and one inside.On a side note, if you are camping with people that like to play pranks, DO NOT mount this light over your head in the tent, because someone outside can pull the magnet off and it will fall on your head which i imagine would be quite painful."
3,It Worked fine....BUT,"When I opened the package/light at the campsite I realized the magnet had unstuck from the body rendering it useless, only a visual inspection was done prior. Luckily I had some tape to hold them together and was able to improvise. Otherwise, there was no complaints operationally, I strongly recommend that you physically check the item and check it before reaching the campsite."
2,Battery tent light,"Great concept but unfortunately not enough light to be useful.Easy to use with magnet base, but light output is very low. More like a ""night light"" than a general purpose light."
2,Not so hot,"I agree with the below poster's review: the light is much less bright than I expected; it was not enough light to read by after dark, unless I took it down and held it in one hand just over the book. It was extremely difficult to position by myself, requiring me to place it my arm's length from the tent flap, which was not particularly useful. I could've forgiven all that, but the bulb dimmed down to nothing after four hours' use! This was a brand new light from the store, which came with bulb included, and a brand spanking new pack of batteries. If I hadn't also brought two LED candles, I would've been in serious trouble. Thanks, but no thanks, Coleman."
2,not working after 30 min,ok so i just received my package and everything seems to be on point. put the 4 batteries and closed it back up. now after 30 minutes of use the light turned off. i know its not the batteries because i just opened them up fresh. i looked at the bulb and it does not seem that the connection of the wire burned out and now i dont know what to do. i will contact them to see why this happened. but i do like this little device.
4,Pretty Good,"its okay but the back keeps falling off and the batteries fall. i love the idea and it okay but taking it off and putting it on are bad, overall i love the light"
4,Camping must.,"Great for tent nightlite. We had 2 tents and used 1 in each, can't read by it, but good for having to rise in middle of night or quick search through camp gear. worth the purchase."
4,"Gives a good light, easy to use","I bought this for our camping trip. It is very easy to use, I just clipped it onto the tent and we used it every night. The battery power seemed to be running out since it only uses 4 AA batteries, but apart from that it was good."
3,Coleman Tent Light,"We used the light camping this weekend. We have a tall tent so we tried it on the ceiling of the inside of the tent, but the weight of the magnet was too much. We moved it to the inside pocket by the bedding area and it worked good as a nightlight. However, to rely on it soley as your source of light at night will not work. Battery lantern worked much better and brighter."
2,"Not so good a product, quite disappointed","The lights are so bright, even with new batteries. the magnetic feature of this light didn't work so well inside the tent, as there is virtually no place to stick it to. not recommended."
5,Good Buy,"I mounted the baseplate for this light on the overhead roll-over bar on my Kawasaki Mule. Works great for an ""interior"" light. I keep the light in the glove box until I need it."
2,Nice light but under-engineered,"This is a great concept for a light. The base is metal and there are magnets located under the light portion so you can put the base on the outside of the tent and the light on the inside and they hold together without any strings, straps, etc.I expected it to be brighter than it actually was but the main problem is that every time I went to move the light, I ended up pulling the cover off and exposing the batteries instead of separating the light from the base. Looks like the little clips that are supposed to hold the light section together are not properly designed and do not hold over the separating force of the magnets and the base.**Needs to be brighter.**Need to redesign clips that hold light together."
4,Nice little light!,"Just got back from a camping trip using the coleman light. I used it in a 11 X 11 dome tent right above the main entrance. It worked great; not very bright, but bright enough to see inside. It's very secure, it took wind gusts up to 35mph all night long without falling down."
3,Good enough,"I was glad I had this lamp for our tent, but I was disappointed at how dim it was. I also didn't manage to figure out how to attach it to the tent pole (though admittedly, I didn't try to hard, either). I'm not sure I'd recommend it, but it was good enough."
4,"Good value, but not quite 5-star","SUMMARYMeets expectations. Easy to attach to tent and will not move once attached. However, the light is not very bright and is best used as a secondary light in a larger tent. It may be okay in a 1-2 person tent, but in a family sized tent, you will need additional light if you are going to be reading, playing games, etc. Overall, a good value for the price, but not quite a 5 star product.PLUSESEasily attachable to the tent. The magnet is very strong and once you have the light positioned where you want it, it is not going to go anywhere.Lightweight and compact. Its' small size means that you can shove it in the tent bag so it is there when you set up camp.DELTASThe light is not very bright. Guessing that it is approximately the brightness of a 40-60 watt bulb."
5,It worked,"This cute little light is awesome. I have a small tent, and I haven't used it in a bigger tent, but it gives off a lot of light. On the way home from camping, the light was accidentally turned on, and the battery didn't die! It has been 8 months since my camping trip, and I am still using the same batteries."
4,Great Tent Light,"This little light is great for the tent...lights up everything. It says that it runs off 4 AA batteries, but I can take two of the batteries and it still lights up...just as bright. I think that this light is a great buy for camping trips."
2,Get another kind,"It is not bright at all! I've used it a few times and have brand-new Energizer Lithium batteries and it is not bright enough to see any detail (like on zippers and things). It's like being in a dimly lit bar. Also it's very heavy so when you attach it magnetically to your tent it will make the tent sag considerably. You can't use those mesh shelves, it will yank them right down. So you have to reach clear up on top of the tent (under the rain fly) then have someone else hold the other part of the light (if you have a family size tent). There are a lot brighter, lighter, and better lights for the same money."
2,Not for camping,"I bought it based on Amazon reviews. If you have a closet or cupboard that needs extra light use it there, not out camping. It is heavy duty with the emphasis on heavy. Just about any camping light would be more practical than this. I am dissapointed in the reviewers who gave this a glowing review."
1,Night Light,"It 's a pretty poor light for my purpose. If all you want is a night light, it's fine, but don't expect illumination to read."
3,"Bright, but heavy","They are very bright, and last for quite some time, but they are rather heavy and weigh down the tent a bit when attached."
3,Decent Light - Is It Necessary for Backpacking?,"Coleman makes good products, but this is more of a novelty item. The magnet feature is cool as you can virtually locate the magnet anywhere on your tent surface (easier to do with two people), by placing the magnet bar on the outside and light inside. The Xenon bulb puts out enough light to see what you are doing in your tent (I have a small two-man Eureka tent), but it definitely is not a reading light source. The four ""AA"" batteries that it needs will last for a good long weekend, but probably not a week. Also, keep in mind that it weighs about ten ounces with batteries if you are backpacking. However, it's a lot safer than a candle or a hot Coleman lantern. I would suggest a small pen-light would suffice for rough backpacking."
3,Convenient but not that bright,The light connects easily and securely to the tent and it's easy to take off. It's easy to use and nice to have a push button light in the tent. Its only drawback is that it's not all that bright.
2,Not good enough,"This light is a nice over all design, but lacks efficient lighting. It is also very heavy and burns through batteries!"
4,Nice little light,This is great for camping trips! Easy to turn on and get a bright light when you need it. Strong magnet that secures it in place. Good deal!
5,Excellant,When I first read the reviews on this light I wasn't so sure. Have only used it once but it was great! Gives off enough light for a tent and I like the fact that you can put it on the side wall of the tent and not just on the top! The magnet is so strong that you won't have any worries!
5,Nice light,"This is an awesome light for the price. The one thing that slightly disappointed me is that I thought it was a circular light, just photographed at an angle, but it is elliptical just like in the picture. Not a huge deal, though, as it worked very well."
5,Magnet is nice and strong.,"I use this coleman tent light inside an enclosed utility trailer. When the trailer isn't hooked up to my truck, my dome lights inside the trailer don't work. With this small light, I just use the magnetic feature on the light and attach it to the inside wall of the trailer. I can move it around anywhere I want without having to attach it permanently. The magnets are surprisingly strong. I use it in the tent while camping, and in the trailer when I'm not."
3,Ok tent light,"Not nearly as bright as I thought it would be. Maybe I was expected LED type lighting, which this is not. Other than that, it is a tent light, not much else to expect from it."
4,Bright and stays in place,"This light worked out very well in our camper at a no-electricity campground. It stayed up on the camper canvas wall and was bright enough to illuminate the camper. On the downsidee, The batteries died quicky, but luckily we brought extras."
1,Coleman tent light,I got the coleman tent light and the 25 LED tent light. The coleman puts out very little light.
1,Could Not Use,"After reading other reviews I purchased this to use in our screen tent. However, when I received it, the second thing on the instructions said, Do Not Use On Screens. I returned them for fear that the heavy magnet would tear the screen in the screen room."
3,Batteries not included!,I haven't used this light yet. I took it on the trip not realizing that the batteries were not included. I guess we'll use it next trip.
3,Handy but not very bright,This light is nice because you can position it pretty much anywhere but it's only bright enough to navigate a dark tent and not step on someone. This is not a reading light or even a light to play cards by. And b/c it's battery operated it's not a good night light. Maybe great in a tiny 1 person tent where you could have it inches from your face/reading material but not in a family size tent.
4,Great tent light!,Loved this tent light...it was very helpful in setting up inside our tent. It lit up the inside of our 12x14 tent very well. The magnetic back used to attach the light to the tent is super strong so it definitely stays in place. Complaint...only one...when you take the magnet backing to remove or move the light the back cover that holds the batteries comes apart. That super strong magnet I mentioned earlier...well it's part of that battery cover.
4,Wonderful reading companion in your tent.. and good for other uses :-),When I first unpacked it I thought it was a bit small but once the tent was set up and night came I appreciated this nifty light. Due to the handy magnet plate you can easily mount it even on a string hanging from the top of the tent. Once we used it as a reading light hooked up above the mat it was in constant demand and we had to take turnes each night. Even if it's raining outside and you want to play cards and have no lantern - it suffices although it's not as bright as a lantern. We won't go camping without it again!
5,Simple enough.,"What can I say? This thing does its job. I read reviews about it not being able to hold thicker picks, and I call B.S. I don't use a pick often, but it's obvious when a bass line sounds better with a pick, and I play some of those. On any given song I'll have 2 5mm rubber picks, a 5mm rubber and a 3mm Big Stubby, or a 5mm rubber and a felt pick, and I haven't dropped a pick yet. The first thing I did when I put the picks in was shake my bass as hard as I could. I put on the strap and did jumps, spins, and kicks I would never do live. The picks held firm, and were right there when I needed them. Now I just need a pick basket to throw my picks into when I make quick transitions to finger plucking.Bottom line: If you use a pick, ever, get it."
4,Tomorrow at Seven,I love Chester Morris. This is a great mystery movie with lots of twists. Some may remember Chester Morris in all of the Boston Blackie movies. Chester Morris is in a more serious role in this movie rather than a light hearted comedic part as in the Boston Blackie movies.
4,A good mystery film from Alpha Video,"This has enough intrigue and suspense for a nice quiet evening when you are in the mood for a low budget who done it. I found this movie to be paced really well & when you are in the mood to watch this sort of movie this wont disappoint. Curl up in bed , relax and enjoy. The DVD transfer from Alpha is average to okay, basically the usual, they just get it on DVD and no remastering. I do wish some other company would put out some better quality print. Tomorrow at Seven stars Chester Morris(from The Bat Whispers,Alibi, The She Creature as well as Boston Blackie) who is tracking the Black Ace, who leaves an Ace of Spades after he kills people. Pretty good who-done-it for its kind. Other good Alpha mysteries to check out Murder at Dawn, Midnight Warning, & House of Secrets"
2,Not very good,"Not Boston Blackie, it came up when I was searching for Blackie. This isn't very good and I don't recommend it."
5,all the seasons are full of flavor,"At first glance this book is beautifully laid out with sections divided by the seasonal produce that you can obtain at the greenmarket and recipes to go along. Incredibly handy for someone who has been lured by a cookbook's recipes only to find that the ingredients are out of season. Not only do you get the recipes, but also a wonderful history lesson on the greenmarket and mini interviews with the ""market people."" Straight forward, uncomplicated, with the accent on fresh delicious produce right from the farm. But if you are unable to make it to the market many of the ingredients are also available in your local grocery store. A great addition to any cooks library."
5,My son loves this,"We borrowed this book form the library, but may buy it. The first night I read it, my 26 month old asked for it to be read three times in a row. He is fascinated with it and already repeats lines. He also thoroughly enjoys pointing out each of the different types of construction vehicles."
2,Not helpful if you are look ing for serious solutions,"This book is a collection of Q & A's where Donaldson responds to people who ask her advice about their particular dog problems. Although some generalizations can be made from the problems included, it's hard to know how to generalize--i.e. whether and how a suggestion given to one owner makes sense in your own case. This means that this book is at best marginally useful for people who want and need detailed advice on how to reform their dog's behaviour. If you have a serious problem, don't look for reliable solutions in this book of anecdotes."
5,Recommended,"Easy to read, clear and sensible advice given in response to 'real life' scarios and dog problems."
3,decent reference book,"This book is written in question/answer form. Sort of like a Dear Jean column. There's definitely valuable information in there. It helps to supplement any work you are doing with a difficult dog and helps in the case that you might not be able to hire a professional at this moment. But I wouldn't say it was any adequate replacement for a knowledgeable and experienced handler. If you're working with an especially tough training situation (like any described in this book), you should definitely do your best to find a reward-based trainer that can zero in on the problem, give you step-by-step guidance, and help refine the plan as needed."
3,Dogs Are From Neptune,"I was disappointed. The advertisement for the book said, ""If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, then dogs are from their own planet, Neptune, where the rules for social interaction are very alien to our own."" I had expected it to be more about the psychology of canines but it is a book that contains questions and answers that have appeared on the Website of a dog trainer about how to deal with aggressive dogs. Good title, good book if you are looking for ideas on how to deal with aggressiveness in dogs, but not psychology of dogs."
2,Poorly written,"This is a poorly written book, and I liked it less than Culture Clash, which I didn't really like either. Many of the problems she highlights, like pulling on a leash, end up with very little practical advice. Instead we get intellectualized jargon. Donaldson is in need of a very good editor, or prhaps a co-writer who knows the art of wordsmithing."
2,Not worth the money,"Jean's other book, The Culture Clash is much better than this one. This book is simply a reprint of questions submitted to Jean via the Internet and her answers. There are many grammatical, spelling and typographical errors which make it seem as though the book was thrown together in Microsoft Word in an afternoon. The information presented is useful, but most will be better off with The Culture Clash."
3,An Advice Column for Dog Issues,"And, like all advice columns, sometimes you get an answer to your question, and sometimes you don't. There is a lot of good information on behaviorism buried in the recommendations...but sometimes you have to read about a completely unrelated training issue to find out about things like desensitization and counter-conditioning. If you have the time, definitely read entries on more than just the issue that interests you.There is also a bit more jargon in here than I thought was strictly necessary - if you don't have the concepts of behaviorism and learning theory down, you probably need to read another book before this one. Try such gems as Sophia Yin's ""How to Behave So Your Dog Behaves,"" which introduces the concepts *first,* then shows you how to apply them. Also check out anything by Patricia McConnell, who not only knows her stuff, but knows how to teach it."
2,Mr. Bungle should sue,"This album title has been used before. Come on Gedge, remember the old days? when you used to come up with your own ideas? actually, neither do i."
4,"I liked the first album better, but still...WOW!","There are a few songs that just don't click completely, but the others are the same catchy, melodic gems found on the first album. Yes, there are strings and movie soundtrack flourishes, but it still rocks and represents a comeback from the unevenness of the last few Wedding Present releases. I heard once that David Gedge prefers to write about falling in love or breaking up as those moments tend to be the most intense. I agree, and he's still creating whimsical and slightly bizarre circumstances with characters you can readily identify with. Standouts include the first track and ""Because I'm Beautiful"" which I can't get out of my head. If you liked the first Cinerama album or past Wedding Present releases, I would not hesitate to buy this album."
3,3.5 Too Polite,"With this second outing David and Sally continue with their ""always been a John Barry element to our music"" excursions. Cards on the table time here - I am one of those indie-kids who had The Wedding Present as the soundtrack to teenage heartbreak. Now I'm (supposedly) all grown up shouldn't I like this cd more than I do? A lot of it is too mannered and polite for my taste - while Gedge can still write well about seduction and heartbreak - there aren't enough poignant tunes to back it up.The Delgados and B&S offer more on the melodies front, as does Cinerama's own debut ""Va Va Voom"". I don't want to appear too down on the record, but naming a song ""Superman"" in the wake of The Flaming Lips' superior effort is a bad move."
4,Almost as good...,"I love thier first Va Va Voom, and this album continues with the same style. This album (like all thier albums)could possibly be considered a little repetitive, but I can put it on repeat and listen to it over and over without getting bored of it.Highly recommended!"
5,What a Well-Written Mystery...,"I must say that I enjoyed Hum of Hushed Voices from start to finish. I was captivated by the title of the novel alone and my curiousity and intense enjoyment of this story didn't end throughout my read, or after the last page was read, I must add. Darby Jacobs is a rookie cop who is thrust into a ""mystery"" when her former psychologist is found dead in his office. Some think it's suicide, but Darby thinks differently . . . she thinks it was murder. Her search for answers takes the reader on a journey of surprises, including the ending, so don't ruin it by reading ahead! Lisa Young has a true gift of placing you in the story. Several times during this novel I felt I was there. It is well-written and enjoyable. I highly recommend this book. Five stars all the way!"
2,And once there was this time when...,"So, one day this book turns up in my mailbox. I decided I'd read it. I'm an atheist and I'm ordained in the Universal Life Church, so I thought I'd give this a read. Easy reading, somewhat rambling. I saw it as a sort of reality check on the totally seperate cultures people living in the same general geographical locations can live in: these are things that this guy finds/found scandalous and which I find too trivial to name. I'm probably too young to have cared about many of the names dropped and i'm not really interested in the history of the Luthern Church (whatever Synod), so there's a lot of material there that doesn't impact my life.The most interesting part to me, personally, was the amount of political pull and power he exhibits in the book. That was the sobering thought that let me get through without skipping too many pages."
1,It's not even Glenn Miller!?!,"Glenn Miller is the king of big bands. His music is legendary, and although he died young in 1944 at the age of 40, his music lives on. We have very nice compilations out there to help promote Glenn's legacy.This one looks like a nice set. It's got 20 songs and all of the Glenn Miller standards. It's cheap and affordable. Sounds great, right?Wrong. THIS ISN'T EVEN GLENN MILLER!!! The appropriate title would be 'A Tribute To Glenn Miller.' And yes, the title is '20 Best of Glenn Miller Sound,' why do we need to release this? Once again, Madacy is just trying to rip you off.Buy 'Greatest Hits.' Buy 'The Essential Glenn Miller.' Buy 'The Centennial Collection.' Those are all great sets to own if you're a Glenn Miller fan. But stay far, far away from this piece of junk.Not recommended."
3,"OK, but not the real thing","The idea of recreating the Glenn Miller *Sound* in stereo is good. This orchestra is certainly good enough and the arrangements are Miller's own. But please note that this is not the Glenn Miller Orchestra or Glenn Miller's Army Air Force Band. Another clue that it's not the real thing? The cover art is a closeup of a french horn, which, to my knowledge, Glenn Miller never recorded.If you buy it, just know what you are getting."
4,"If you are a casual fan of big band, this is a good deal","First I must note that this isn't the Glenn Miller orchestra or the original Glenn Miller recordings, yet a cover by another band. If you aren't a huge Miller fan and just like his music, this will do though. If you are a big fan of the original Miller orchestra, I would advise you to look elsewhere, there are actually box sets dedicated to his early career. The songs are covered very nice though and are pretty close to the original Miller orchestra in terms of quality and professionalim, and if you are just a contemporary listener of big band, this will probably need to be the only Glenn Miller CD you need to get the best variety of his songs. I agree that it is a deceiving title, but it isn't a bad deal either."
2,Nice Idea but it needs some improvement.,These logs are ok but do not heat as well as Duraflame or Presto Logs. They are a little bit cheaper to buy but you have to really burn 2 or more logs to generate adequate heat. This product also creates LOTS of ash. They do light easily and are an ideal log for nights that are not too cold.
2,There are Better Products Available,"These logs are hard to light, don't produce enough heat, difficult to keep alight, produce too much ash, and do not remain intact during unwrapping. Get yourself some DuraLogs because these are not good."
1,Nice idea... would be better if it worked,"I bought these at Lowe's as a cheaper and more environmentally-friendy alternative to Duraflame and other logs. With most other logs, you simply light the wrapper and you're done. Not so with the Enviro-Log. You need to remove the wrapper and use it as kindling in order to get the log to light. The log itself is composed of recycled waxed cardboard. Unfortunately, the wax seems to be pretty fire-resistant. It has taken a major effort every time just to get the log to light, and then usually a small portion of the log will burn for a while and then go out. I've also tried dousing it with lighter fluid, and sometimes even this is not terribly helpful. Needless to say, having to add extra kindling and even resorting to lighter fluid completely negates any supposed environmental advantages of this product. It's just another ""green"" product that isn't. Not recommended."
1,The fire log that doesn't burn,"If you want something that lights easily, this is the opposite product. After a week long camping trip, the joke was that we needed to bring a bale of hay for every fire we wanted to have with these, because that's about as much kindling material you will need to get one of these going. However, if you want to build a fire-resistant log cabin, this might be the product for you.Spend the extra bucks on a reputable brand. This is a great idea, but for some reason these just don't want to burn. If you already have a fire going, these will work to keep it going. They just don't start well. Very frustrating to use if this is your sole source of burning material. Gave it one star because I can't give it zero."
1,"Don't burn, don't buy","You would think that a product solely designed to burn would, but they don't. When you do manage to get them going somewhat, it is just a small pitiful flame. Not recommended."
1,Nice flame but went out fast,"I thought it had a pretty good flame, no weird odor, I just wish the flame burned longer. It burned for about 1.5 hours."
4,Not too bad for an earth friendly alternative,"After buying a box of these logs, I was surprised to see how many negative reviews they have received and considered returning the whole lot of them. However, I decided to try out a log anyways and I have to say that although they are a bit more difficult to light than a duraflame, they are not nearly as difficult as some of the reviews would suggest. If you follow the directions and crumple the paper and place it under the log, the paper will start the log without any additional effort. The flame is even and natural looking and the duration of the fire is comparable to other fake log products. The only drawback is that like any fake log, the scent is different than burning real wood."
1,Trash logs,So far the log was hard to light and smells like waxie trash. I am not a fan. I like to use the ashes on my garden beds not able to use a trash product. Wish I had better things to say but it is what it is. The trucking and the manufacturing kills the green thing for me.
1,Hard to start and toxic smelling,"This is an awful product. I have purchased several different starter log products and am a big fan of starting my fireplace with one and then burning real wood on top. This product is terrible. It wouldn't light in its entirety, and I had to add another product to get the entire log to catch. Before getting the log to light, it wouldn't produce enough heat and filled my house with smoke forcing me to open all the windows. In addition, it has an awful plastic/wax smell while it burns that woke my wife thinking there was a gas leak in the house.I will never purchase this product again and will warn my family members to not purchase it as well."
2,Mediocre at best,"It's a great log if you hate logs that actually burn.The flame is always small - if this gives off any heat whatsoever, I haven't felt it.I'm almost tempted to throw the rest of the box out. Our Enviro Logs are 0-for-5 at this point."
1,"Terrible, toxic odor.","My partner and I were just sitting down to watch a movie next to our first ""Enviro-Log"" fire and after about 10 minutes of burning we both started to feel sick. Yes the chimney flue was open and the fireplace glass doors were closed (but there is a small gap between the doors for air to circulate). Needless to say, after dousing the log with water, it took several hours of open windows (on a cold night!) to get the house air back to normal. It's bad enough to breath smoke from burning wood, but burning wax is really nasty...at least for us."
2,Enviro-logs,"The instructions say to light the ends with the seam ""up"". They do not burn well. I have to keep putting lit newspaper under the log to get it to burn.I will buy Dura-flame."
2,Not that good,"During my master thesis I read parts of this book. One thing I can say about it, is that if you don't know projective geometry when beginning to read this book, you will not learn it from here. Yes, Faugeras probably has a very intuitive feel for this field of science but he does not explain his ideas in a pedagogical manner. My advise is, read the book and get the idea, then read some other book to do it. Faugeras will not tell you how.I got this confirmed from two other sources as well, after discovering it myself."
1,NOT A PAIR,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas. He just opened it tonight (Christmas Eve). It was not a pair!!! Only 1 dumbell. The box even says ""pair."" A pair, in my understanding, means ""two."" I am so disappointed."
4,"EXPECTED ROUND PLATES AS ILLUSTRATED, RECEIVED SQUARE","WORKS WELL, CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLASTIC GUIDES TO SELECT THE PROPER WEIGHT. WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH FORCE TO BREAK THEM."
5,Batou Fitness pair of adjustable dumbbells,"Dumbbells are easily adjustable from 10 to 50 pounds, by simply lifting then sliding a pin, from side to side. Each unit comes with a cradle (which I keep on the floor to avoid accidents), to house the weights. Great for arm curls, one arm rows,wrist curls ..... among others. At 69 years of age, an easy way to improve upper body strength."
4,Happy,"This set is good for home gym if you're trying to conserve space. Adjusting weights isn't always smooth (sometimes it takes a few attempts), but it's very convenient. They work best with a flat or adjustable bench. I bought a bench that folds up the garage."
1,"not a PAIR, only a single dumbbell",I disregarded the previous reviews and ordered these dumbbells. As soon as the box arrived I knew I was another unlucky owner of a single dumbbell rather than a PAIR of dumbbells. I'm returning the item. I bet they would be great if you actually got the item that was described.
1,"BUYERS BEWARE OF ""PAIR""","The weights themselves I have yet to try because like many others before me Amazon tried to pass off a single weight as a pair of weights. I went round and round with customer service pointing out that they do in fact have single weights and if they would only send me a single weight I'd be happy enough because then I'd have the pair promised. Instead they wanted to give me half the cost of the pair back and have me buy a single weight at the going rate, which happens to be $15 more than they are as a pair. I think not! SO now I have reordered and have a written confirmation that I will get the pair this time. If I actually get a pair I'll consider raising my rating."
4,Erudite and accessible study,"This is a terrific book, the product of years of loving study of the birds of Pakistan. The author includes many of his own observations, but he has also combed the literature. If some 19th century official found a nest of a particular species, Roberts knows about it. The result is a finely nuanced account of each species, its features, and its behaviors. The author is also very knowledgable about Pakistani plants, insects, agriculture, and ecology, erudition that makes the accounts of the individual species more detailed and convincing. His mastery of the older literature means that he has been able to trace changes in distribution and populations. This is a deeply learned book, valuable not just for people in Pakistan but also in areas sharing the same species. There is also a very thorough bibliography.The only weakness of the book is that the plates are a little scanty, so a good field guide is also needed.An extremely useful book, even for relative amateurs like me."
5,A classic!,This work by Horowitz is a classic teaching manual.Because it uses descriptive notation it is a godsendto an older person like myself who learned using it.Horowitz' presentation is captivating.
3,Disney First 100 Years,I returned the book and as result did not read it. When I am able to get another copy I will review the book at that time
5,yumeji's theme,arrived promptly in good condition. heard theme on a restaurant website and loved it hence the order.
5,Parkening Plays Bach: Virtuoso Music for Guitar,"I found Pakening's transcriptions to be wonderfully true to the original compositions. I especially enjoyed the transcription of BE THOU WITH ME (Aria: Bist Du bei mir BWV 508). Though some of the stretches are fairly difficult, the music is beautiful in nature. Reguarding the stretches, Parkening himself said ""No compromise has been made in requirements of technique."" I give this book five stars."
4,Recommend,I like his transcriptions. Some are very challenging. Not for the beginner at all. Buy the recording to listen. It will help with the playing style beyond just the notes.
5,Great Voice!,"O'Neill captures well the angst of Regine whose first love just happens to be Soren Kierkegaard, a wildly intelligent man who battles depression. Based on a true story, O'Neill does a stunning job of integrating a true sense of place and custom along with the tortuous, meandering thoughts of a girl in love with an impossible man. Even in that wrestling, there is hope. And another man who loves her through the pain. If you're looking for a well-written, beautifully crafted novel, this book will satisfy."
2,"Good story idea, poor execution","The idea behind ""Loving Soren"" is compelling: a story about a tormented genius who pursues and seduces a young woman he loves later to leave her. While O'Neill's research is much appreciated and the pacing of the novel is quite good, her writing lacks nuance. She would outright state exactly how Regina feels and thinks even when the scene is already set up so we know her reaction. The writing is very on-the-nose. It is clearly O'Neill's first novel and she painfully reiterates points over and over. If you think this is going to be a classic piece of fiction with poignant insights into the human psyche you will be disappointed."
3,"i have seen the wind, and it's cold enough for me","this book opens with blackwood's great story: the wendigo. B is the master of the setting, noone can create the background and atmosphere like him. a very well written story from Brennan here. and Meloff's story is also an interesting read. derleth is at his best here. i don''t care that much for the guy, have never considered him to be HPL's great successor or anything, but he knows how to write, and i have always considered his story about Ithaqua to be his best contribution. the rest of the stories are well written. i don't think any of chaosium's anthologies contains of so much good writing than this. but good is not great. and the rest of the stories never turns out to be really good. the suspence killed by irrelevant writing going on for too long, mostly. sad. but the book is still wort reading"
1,Don't waste your $$$,If you're looking for a good Eagles CD+G karaoke CD then keep on looking. This CD DOES NOT have on screen lyrics. I guess you are suppose to read the lyrics off the liner notes. Not acceptable!
1,Disappointed,Does not provide lyrics on the screen. Very disappointed. You get lost during the song - even with the lyric booklet.
5,Great skate video!,This was an amazing piece of skateboarding history.It was brand new and great quality!
4,Good Quality parts,I recently bought this part for my 98 Suzuki. parts come with 1 piston seal and 1 piston boot. and a bleed valve cap. installation was easy. Be care full not to damage or stress the seal and the boot.
4,"Great DVD, if you're a photographer","...I think it's the best in the Sports Illustrated series, and I have all of them. But I'm a photographer, and the reason I think it's good is because there's lots of footage here of the photographers working with the models. There's a segment on Terry Richardson and how he often uses point and shoot cameras, which I found very interesting. The beautiful women are still there, and I get to watch some of the best photographers in the world work. I think it's great. The most irritating part of this DVD for me was the quick MTV cuts and the parts where they made the image roll as if the vertical hold had gone haywire on the TV set. That was just annoying."
1,MTV Uncensored - Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue 2001,Once again nothing that fantastic. the only thing that fits the description of fantastic is the word UNCENSORED.does not live up to expectations apart from a few see through scenes. i guess i'll wait till christmas before i give it away.
3,Great DVD .. but ..,"It feels more like a ""making-of"" documentary than a sexy video. Almost clinincal in its analysis of the shoots, so called imaginary problems, dizzy models complaining, etc .. If I buy a swimsuit video, I want the girls to be hot and posing .. like in the ""Wild Girls: Thailand"" DVD .. a bit diff, but hot nonetheless."
2,Reference for Chinese Teacher of the Western World,"There are many foreigners learning Chinese nowadays, including the English speaking people in the US or Europe.This book provides some tips in learning Chinese for the English native speaker, mainly on listening and speaking. For writing, you'd better look for other books on the topic.For Chinese Teacher in the West, you could know what problems English speaker may encounter and how they deal with it. You may think of some solution out of this which should be useful in your future teaching.Since Lee Kuan Yew is also a Chinese and have been exposed to Chinese environment in Singapore, his learning experience may be somehow different from those English speaker in the West, especially the kids.You may take a look however."
2,"Recipes are tasty, but author lacks scholarship.","Recipes from before the 15th Century are difficult to find, as many of the documents are now missing, and most cooks of the earlier times passed their secrets by word of mouth. The documents from which this edition is translated were mentioned as being from about 800-900 CE. In several of his recipes, Vehling includes Bell peppers, which while tasty, are definitely New World. He further neglects to have his Latin originals for comparison. When compared to the Anthimus letter, written in about 450-470 CE, the techniques and ingredients used by Vehling are very modern indeed. All in all, a book of good recipes, but lacking in the scholarship required to make it an authentic translation from that period of history."
1,Vehler's Apicius is not the best,"While this book is a good research tool for readers of Latin, I find Mr. Vehling took too many modern liberties in his redactions of the recipes. He often substitutes, adds, or deletes ingredients without explanation or just cause."
2,Good Thing It Was A Gift,"Spared the horror of paying good money for this, I concur with the other reviewers that this is a letdown.The measurements have been tampered with and the reliability of the historicity is questionable.There is a reductionist spirit here at work."
2,Not Worthy of Apicius,"The main failure of this book is its lack of integrity regarding history & honesty of ingredients in the recipes. Beyond that, I am most offended by the AGGRESSIVE attempt @ revisionist/politically correct history; at trying to portray our epoch as anything other than A.D. (After Death of Christ). It seems as though even the culinary sciences are not free from the counter cultural revolutionary dogmatists."
3,Roman,"Marcus Gavius ApiciusThe Roman recipes were taken from ""De re coquinara"" by Marcus Gavius Apicius. The age of this work is unclear. According to the Swedish National Encyclopedia Apicius lived during the first half of the first century AD. The ""De re coquinara"" is attributed to Apicius althogh it is believed to have been written by a certain Caelius in the 3rd century AD."
4,Great book,This caught my interest very quickly and I breezed right through it! I couldn't find the second book at the bookstore so I'm waiting on bated breath for this one.It's a great read.
1,BoxWave Micro HP Charger does not work as advertised,"Was told by HP customer service to look for a HP Palm Pre 2 Car charger and that they would work fine with the new HP TouchPad.I found this one on Amazon as the HP online store had no stock.Paid the $25+ dollars and tried it out a week ago and get an error message on the HP TouchPad that says insufficient voltage.Two things to remember:1. HP customer service is overseas (Phillipines)and they are not all the sharpest pencils in the box.2. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.If any one wants a good car charger for their Palm Pre 2 this would work great. (I think)"
4,Good book,"Definitely one of the better the better books out there relating to human biology and human evolution. The book is basically the biological version of Freakonomics (similar in format at least). Very readable. Having a degree in biology, I was surprised by how much I learned."
5,Fascinating exploration of the link between Sickness and Longevity,"In Survial of the Sickest, Moalem has a refreshing take on the purpose of many genetic ailment's and diseases - that they are actually evolutionary mechanisms that serve to protect the organism!The book is loaded with numerous and engaging examples of the connection between sickness and longevity such as the link between hemochromatosis and surviving bubonic plague, resistance to malaria and sickle cells and many others.There is also an introduction to an exciting field known as epigenetics - how children can inherit traits without changes in the underlying dna or put another way - how the expression of genetic traits is a bit more malleable than thought and how environmental factors can actually effect genetic expression.On top of all this Moalem has put all this information in a very well written, form. A benchmark for how science writing can be informative and enjoyable."
5,Interesting perspective about disease and evolution,This is a highly recommended book by OUTFOX. This book helps the reader better understand disease and what can be done to reduce negative effects. It teaches a responsible approach to disease rather than using scare tactics. This book is best when paired with books that teach scare tactics in relation to communicable diseases. Comparing and contrasting approaches from two different types of books will help the reader choose the more responsible actions in reference to their own personal infection control and hygiene. This is recommended for health classes and courses for new medical professionals.OUTFOXOUTFOXprevention.com
4,Interesting!,"I was assigned this book as a summer read for a high school biology class and was very impressed. Not only is this book informative and relevant to the non-scientist, but it is also extremely readable- and dare I say enjoyable?"
5,Interesting,"It's a really interesting perspective. It's all very speculative, even with the evidence given, but it was very thought provoking. I enjoyed it."
5,A must read for science teachers!,"I thought this book was great. An easy, but informative read. After each new ""thing,"" I found myself trying to go and tell everyone I saw about the evolutionary advantages of too much iron in your blood, or high blood sugar. Of course, not everyone in my life is a bio geek like myself. But on the plus side, you don't have to be one to appreciate this book. I plan on using this book in my biology classes."
3,"Interesting information, poor editing...","I absolutely love reading books where I learn a great number of new things. This book provided me with absolutely that. There were plenty of times where I said to myself, ""That's very interesting, I never knew that."" Unfortunately along with these revelations came some pretty dry and mind numbing information. Reader beware.Pros+ Some great information and parallels between past and present. Everything from brown fat to parasites to diabetes.+ Author uses a life experience to pursue a career and then publish their findings.Cons- Although there's a lot of great information included it's rather poorly edited at times. There were sections that droned on and contained a bit too much jargon for my liking.- Too many uses of bad puns/play on words. Starts out charming, ends up annoying.It was an informative read but that's about it. I could have gotten the same information watching documentaries on Discovery."
5,I Love this Book,"This has become one of my favorite books. It was interesting, educational and extremely hard to put down."
5,Eye opening,"I added this book to my queue after seeing Dr. Moalem on the Daily Show. The ideas expressed in the short interview were fascinating, and the book only got better.Aside from the reporting on the state-of-the-art of evolutionary biology, epigenetics, and related fields, this book does a better job of explaining why and how our bodies react to certain diseases, and paints a much clearer picture of the evolutionary mechanisms that made our species into what it is today.This book should be required reading in High School or College Biology classes. If I were 18, this book would certainly make me consider being a biologist."
5,Eye Opening,"You don't need a degree in evolutionary biology to understand Survival of the Sickest. This book gives you a peak into how evolution can actually select for disease, and makes a compelling case for why and how understanding this can shape the way disease is treated in the future. It also explains some fascinating facts - like how some Americans are immune to HIV because they have a mutation and how a person can rust to death but be saved by giving blood. It'll leave you thinking completely differently about your body, and - in some cases - like when it advises that you should take your sunglasses off for a few minutes when you get into the sun so that your eyes can ""tell"" your skin to be on guard against it, it'll actually affect the way you act."
1,JUNK SCIENCE,"I made it to p. 112 before tossing this book in my trash bin. Specifically, I did not give it away because it's contents are dangerous. I am a physician with over 30 years of clinical experience and I have extensive education RE the issues discussed in this book. Specifically, this book is junk science. There are no footnotes or further references RE its contents because no reputable scientist would write such garbage. The writing is teleologic (evolution by pre-conceived design, i.e. intelligent design). Furthermore, it is poorly written (redundant, verbose, chaotic in its organization) and full of scientific errors and misinformation.Don't believe me? Then do your own research by Goggling the author's name plus any of the following word strings ""junk science"", ""exposed"", ""fraud"" and you will get approximately 3,000 hits. Read any of them and you will quickly realize this book is unadultrated rubbish."
5,Read this when you're sick and you'll feel great!,"PROS: The prose flows. It's funny and informative. Outstanding writing. Thought-provoking analysis.CONS: A few diagrams/illustrations would have been helpful.CONCLUSION: I rarely give 5 stars, but this book deserves it! A must-read to open your mind to biology and life on Earth."
2,Eclectic mix,"Very pretty color glossy pictures, and it did include sketches of the floor plans of the featured homes. But I found the homes featured to be very much ""one of a kind"" applications. I really didn't see how any of the ideas for these homes could be duplicated elsewhere, which is what I was looking for - at least a little inspiration. I much prefer ""The New Cottage Home""."
5,Excellent!,"This book was absolutely fantastic. Well written, and easy to understand, it brings the reader completely through the energy sector, giving you a solid ""investors"" understanding of types of energy companies, as well as when to invest in them. It really helps you understand the parts behind the energy sector, and what moves the market. I highly recommend both this book and Joe Duarte's other book: Successful Biotech Investing."
4,very good collection,"from one of the best voices in reggae comes this studio one compilation of tunes, this and ""silver jubillee"", and trojans ""natty dread"" anthology are the cream of his output."
2,"Lame Entertaiment, Another excuse to go back to barnie.....","While the title and brief (albeit giving away the plot)summary makes you think this movie is worth it for the kids. It's really not. I, being easily swayed by my children, bought this movie with anticipation of something worth there time so i could work. They thoguht the plot was too slow and therefore this movie did not fulfill its promise as entertainment, i recommend you get a barney video or whatever is more worth your time. All those lights give seisures most likely.........Just don't.."
2,Implausible,"Well acted and written in such a way as to disguise the outcome that things are not what they seem. A somewhat ""seen many times before"" script of people engaging in a type of bait and switch scheme to get some money out of an insurance company. The implausibility that all the outcomes should just happen to fall into the exact right place at exactly the right moment with no hiccups actually made the story seem too fairy tale like where it would have been better served to be more realistic."
2,Thin Ice,Not nearly as funny as I thought it would be. This title is not one I could recommend to a wide variety of people. Good shipping service.
4,Movie Starts a Bit Slow and Then Picks Up!,"I am a big fan of mysteries and intrigue, and when I heard this movie related to a Hitchcock film, I knew that I needed to watch this for myself to see what I thought. In watching the film I would have to say that the start of the movie drags a bit as you are getting some of the back story. That being said, the movie does quicken as it moves along and I was impressed with some of the twists and turns that the writers and director take the viewer on. The acting was strong and as a fan of both Kinnear and Arkin, I have to say that they both did a superb job with their characters. The movie was fun and enjoyable and I sat on the edge of my seat waiting for the next card to fall and for the mystery to be revealed and you will too!"
2,What time is it? Time you wasted,"In this film, Mickey asks what time it is toward the end and everyone debated what that meant. What type of con scheme was he planning next? What remotely does this have to do with anything else? I think it means someone who could have had Academy Award nominations wasted time re-editing the film for an unbelievable fairy tale conclusion. I haven't seen The Convincer, but no one has mentioned whether it ended any differently. The film had great potential as an unplanned realistic crime drama, but as is, it wastes your time."
2,"um, wanted to like.... but no","greg kinnear / alan arkin , good stuff (little miss sunshine pair), wanted to like this story. the story of greg's demise as he makes strings of bad decisions with bad luck is ok. the final ""gotcha, nothing was what you thought"" was pretty bad and annoying, and one could blow a hundred holes in the idea, but it's not worth the time. I guess the ending is supposed to explain why alan's acting is so ungodly bad in the movie, however it doesn't take back the pain of the tacky performance. It seems like he almost broke out laughing in a few scenes because his character and dialogue were ridiculous. Greg and Billy tried to bring some drama, but the script and concept are really a dog overall. Don't watch this movie... it may give you a case of hypothermia... uff !"
4,Fun movie.,"I enjoyed this strangely funny, macabre movie with all the surprises at the end. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,The ice was too thin,"I would have turned this off at the halfway point. I was bored. I did not care about any of the characters. But my wife had that silly hope that maybe the ending would pull this movie out. I will admit that I increased my rating from one star to two stars because of the ending. However, it was not enough to make the movie worthwhile. I still did not like any of the characters so why should I care, either in spite of or because of the ending?"
5,The first thing you notice when you open ...,"The first thing you notice when you open Thermasilk Heat Activated Shampoo for the first time is the pleasant smell, not an overpowering """"perfumy"""" odor. Also the bottle is a nice shape, easy to hold. Having very long hair means using quite a bit of shampoo, but even a little bit of Thermasilk was enough to wash all of it. It's very sudsy and didn't leave any residue or stickiness in my hair. I wasn't sure what to think of this company's claim of a """"heat activated"""" shampoo so I knew my usual hair routine would put this to the test. I use both a hair dryer and curling iron, which can sometimes leave my hair feeling dull and dry. The first time I used this shampoo and went about my normal hair routine, I noticed the difference. My hair felt softer and easier to style. It looked shiny and healthy. I received several compliments on my hair the day I started using this shampoo, so I know it worked great! I'll definitely purchase this product again."
4,Worked for my Ford Focus 2006,"This Stereo Install Kit worked out well for my 2006 Ford Focus. I matched this unit up with a JVC KDR-60 receiver. Be aware that this is a universal dash kit so in order to fit a variety of Ford makes and models the kit shell is configured with a lot of plastic removable tabs. These were fairly easy to snap off except the to big ones at the bottom. I literally had to saw them off with a hand saw. There is no way you use your fingers to remove them.Some of you purchasing this kit for certain vehicles will not need to remove the long bottom tabs but for those who may have to you need a saw/knife/torch/grenade to remove them, lol.Overall I have had this kit installed for about 3 months and once installed I have never thought about it again. The kit fit snuggly in the Ford dash area and aligned with the dash seamlessly."
5,Taco Bell Hot Sauce is Great,This hot sauce is the equivalent of Medium in the restaurant (not Fire or Mild). It is excellent. I bought several and gave them as gifts. The packaging kept the bottles very well protected.
5,Islamic Imperialism is REQUIRED reading,"A religion of peace, my eye! This book carefully and methodically disabuses one of the notion that this ""religion"" is based on anything but greed and avarice. It is clear that from its beginning fourteen centuries ago the sole intent is to conquer the world, causing everyone to convert, submit, or die. Those who claim otherwise are blind to reality."
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,This was a hard book to wade through. I can't aruge for or against the author's thesis since I am no expert in this field. However I was looking forward to a good overview of Islamic history. While this book filled in some of the gaps in my knowledge I was left with a lot more. If you are already well versed in middle Eastern history then this might be a good book for you. If you are looking for a first read on the subject this is not the book for you. The writing is more tedious than engrossing. The maps are helpful but insufficient
3,Understanding Islamic History,"It's always good to understand the differences between people as well as what we have in common. This book has taken me into a world I've never really understood. The author has covered much of the history of the Middle East and the influence of Islam on that region. As an older reader, it's good to keep learning about the world, particularly a section of the world that I learned nothing about in school or college. I recommend this book for anyone that is wondering what shapes the thinking of so many people in today's world."
3,"Detailed, but slanted","I enjoyed reading Karsh's book. It helped fill in some gaps in my knowledge of world and religious history. The chapter on the Ottomans was particularly enlightening.Yet I also find the book troubling. The author has gone out of his way to scour Islamic history for everything negative and included almost nothing positive.What is really scary is that some group (I lost the cover letter) sent it to me for free at my church. I am a Christian minister and I presume their intent is that I will now begin exposing the supposed awful truth about Islam in my preaching and classes. I have no tolerance for selective dredging of history for either the good or bad of religion, and increasing inter-religous tensions is the last thing the world needs right now.Rev. Mike Capron"
1,Prof. Karsh's History,"Prof. Karsh'e history of Islamic ""imperialism"" is an agenda-driven history of Islam with a single-minded focus on Muslim conquests described as flowing from Islamic religious teachings. At times, it reads like a political propoganda rather than objective history. Following Bernard Lewis, the author seeks to undersytand the current politics of the Muslim societies in the light of both Islamic theology and Islamic history, neglecting totally the realities of the modern period -- colonialism, nationalism, cold war, and global economic forces. A bad history and a worse politics!"
1,Hiding from the truth,This book is gravely innacuare in its dimensions and reading of history. It is super imposing today's issues with very different roots and sources on 14 centuries of Islamic history which by itself had been misinterpreted to justify the author's Islamophobic stance.Islam is a universal religon of peace and brotherhood.
1,sick of being mischaracterized,"I am not surprised to see any of these reviewers on this page. They are clearly conservatives who laud any book that demonizes islam.Generally I could care less what people say but this statement has forced me to act: we have been told that the `bad' West invented slavery, racism and imperialism and that because of these terrors the world's problems must all be blamed on western colonialism. As someone who is on the left, I have *never* stated that the west invented these conditions. However, the system of slavery that brought Africans to the ""new world"" was different than any form ever known before. The systemic oppression Europe brought into being was different because of the vastness of it. It changed the world forever. Yes, colonialism, slavery and imperialism had occurred before but never to this extent."
4,An Excellent Historty of Islam,This is a excellent book to get a broad historical over view of Islamic History from its beginning to today.
2,Breaks easily,"The heart to chainlink solder has already broken once. Because the chain has extra rings for allowing different sizing, I was able to manage a repair myself. However, I don't expect this ankle chain to last very long given the quality of the materials."
2,Robot Sport Animation Watch,This watch is great for just playing soccer or baseball but not the best appearance look. I wear it all the time when I go out playing sports but not when I am at work. I would still recommend this product though.
1,BUYER BEWARE! You won't receive the product!,"I paid Mike McMillan $56 US for this book over one year ago and I am still awaiting delivery. I did email him. He responded to the first email (that was before I sent the money). Once he got my money, I never heard from him again. Avoid this guy. He is a cheat and a con-artist."
4,Great book for foreigners,"A great book if you are an international and has just come to an English speaking country, especially United States. Practical conversations from daily life."
1,INEFFECTIVE PRODUCT,very ineffective product - do not waste your money!! I used these products for two years as prescribed and had poor results.
4,Misleading listing.,"Amazon has confused things here. They list this CD as Sonodisc CD36512, and title it as ""L'African Fiesta Vol.1"". Actually,Sonodisc CD36512 is ""L'African Fiesta Vol.2"". It starts with the song ""Permission"", and has a picture of Rochereau on the cover. ""L'African Fiesta Vol.1"" is actually Sonodisc CD36509 and has Nico and his guitar on the cover.Both are, of course, classics.Hope this helps you collectors out there!"
5,from the vaults...,"I stumbled upon this one among my dad's old reel-to-reels, and like all the best ""finds"" I had few preconceptions beforehand. I was well aware of Beefheart's insane side, but that's about it. These songs are a breath of fresh air, incredible in their pure quality. I definitely recommend this album if you're in the mood for songwriting with that small difference which adds something special."
5,a love album!,"Captain at one of his bests. As said before: ""The most beautiful love album of all times."" Weird, insane, delightful, amusing! Newer than the newest music!"
2,"What are ya', new?","Are we listening to the same album? First, understand this: if I could only keep 10 records, 4 of them would be Beefheart. Second: Unconditionally Guaranteed stinks! On the heels of four of the the most dazzling records ever made, (Trout Mask, Decals, Clear Spot, and Spotlight Kid,)this turkey was released. It was a monumental disapointment to me in '74. It only looks good compared to the abysmal Blue Jeans and Moonbeams, which followed. The Captain is a flat-out genius, but everybody makes mistakes. This record was just pop schlock. Buy the good stuff."
1,Unconditionally Awful,"I know that there are deliberate tinges of irony to this album. It is an attempt at 'selling out' that announces that it is a 'sell-out'. And I know my review will be dismissed as that of a so-called 'purist'. But I don't care. I cannot listen to this album. It is terrible. If some less distinguished artist had put it out, we would not be talking about it at all. And let it be known that I can listen to all sorts of terrible music. I prefer William Hung to this. It sounds like Captain Beefheart was trying to audition for Three Dog Night or the Osmonds."
1,Beefheart At His Worst,Captain Beefheart is my favourite artist of all time but i got to be honest this album...unless you like the bee gees well maybe not that bad but its terrible for the captain the musics to normal and the lyrics actually make sense. Shiny Beasts Bat Chan puller or Doc At Radar Station are the ones to buy they all are except for this one. only buy this if this one is the only one you dont have oh yeah and dont buy bluejeans and moonbeams its even worse.
4,The Good Captain,"What I love about ""Unconditionally Guaranteed"" is that Beefheart shows he can do convincing love songs. (Could Barry Manilow do Trout Mask Replica?) The title is obviously a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that his music is normally anything but commercial. This album is shocking because it features tuneful songs that really connect (""This kiss is for the first time"") from someone whom you usually associate with musical Surrealism. It's like Dali got all sentimental on you (as he did from time to time, about Gala.) I'm a Beefheart fan since 1969, and I caught the Magic Band in London in 1975; I love this guy, and I think he's on a par with the Greats. If you don't get UG, the joke might be on you. However, I have to admit my fave Beefheart album is still Strictly Personal (bread dog ear)."
3,The weakest of all the Beefheart albums,"I just refreshed my collection by buying all of the Beefheart CDs and this one is the weakest. It just doesn't have the creative craziness of any of the others, all of which are real good, many of which are great."
4,Beefheart with a PG rating,"There's been a lot of railing against this album, but let's recall that the Temptations recorded HELLO YOUNG LOVERS, the Beatles recorded AIN'T SHE SWEET and TILL THERE WAS YOU. Even the great iconoclast Frank Zappa recorded HAPPY TOGETHER and Little Richard's DIRECTLY FROM MY HEART. The entire album is very well produced and UPON THE MY-O-MY, FULL MOON HOT SUN, I GOT LOVE ON MY MIND, THIS IS THE DAY, and LAZY MUSIC are all great tunes. Even the album as a whole is still the Captain. There isn't a band on it that you would not be able to identify WHO was singing. It's mainstream but don't forget Chicago did FREE FORM GUITAR and the Beatles did TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS and The Grateful Dead's WHAT'S BECOME OF THE BABY. Why can't the Captain experiment as well? Admittedly it's uncharacteristic for Captain Beefheart but it's still a good album."
1,Never again,"This cheap thing lasted me less than a month. I remember taking it out during a business meeting and it was rusting, it was so embarrassing I threw the thing out."
3,stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of hilarity,"Most of the book is about the author's journey from what he calls a ""dilettante"" (Pulp Fiction's Vince would have said ""bum"") to dot-com corporate drone wanna-be and back. It's generally bland, though the few funny bits are laugh out loud funny. I especially liked the 5th letter to Jeff (""Accident"") and the description of the Pets.com business plan at the end of ""Fiscal Wonderland"". If you want to save a little time and money, read these two sections in a bookstore and you'll get the best of it."
2,Poor and contrived,"This book promises a lot but fails to deliver. The basic plot is as follows - inexperienced, untrained slacker gets job in Amazon - gets treated pretty well and complains more than Eddier Vedder with a headache. ""Boo Hoo - they are sucking my soul away because they don't have good stationary"" - give me a break. I normally love this type of book and although I snickered a few times I just couldn't understand what his major issue with Amazon was...- come on there must be someone out there with some genuinely interesting stories about working for Amazon. I'm afraid this attempt by a second rate customer service representative just doesn't cut it."
1,"Sophomoric, but not funny","This book was singularly unimpressive. I really wanted to enjoy it, and I really wanted to laugh, whether with or at the author. Unfortunately, it was rarely funny, and the author shows a remarkable lack of insight about himself and about why companies like Amazon are the way they are. There's so much one could say, and so much one could make fun of. It's too bad none of it made it into this book.It *is* pretty funny that the hardcover is listed as remaindered at Amazon as I write this."
2,More a stand up routine than a book....,"This book was not really what I expected. The user seems to be preparing for a standup comedy routine, as oppossed to writing a book. Everything is flip, off the cuff and, most importantly, not funny. Ok, I did chuckle ONCE, but all in all a very weak effort. The whole ""poor me, I am such a slacker so I must be funny"" schtick is old. Mr. Daisey, you should have saved your time writing and just gone and gotten a job.Save your money - skip this."
2,What did he say?,"This memoir/humor type book was written by a former employee of Amazon.com.While the author proclaims himself to be a slacker (read: cool) I thought this story would be quite entertaining.WRONG!I did manage to get through the book (it was no easy feat) and throughout the whole thing, the author manages to write and write but actually says absolutely nothing.It is obvious that the author used this book as nothing more than a vehicle to wax poetic. I did not gleam one piece of interesting information out of this memoir. The book is purported to be funny when, in fact, it is a one great big yawn.An incredibly boring read. Now I know why I found this book on the ""sale"" table at my local bookstore."
1,Endless tape that repeats itself,There is no significance in this book. Most of the people already know that there are sweatshops out there. It can be in the US soils or not. They make a product or support the operations. Many companies use these practices to make money quick. Also I can imagine most of the people understand that it is difficult to be a customer service representative. I really didn't need to be told these ten thousand times. This book didn't make me laugh it made me depressed. No wonder this book is so repetitive since there is not much for author to write on the subject that it is repetitive to start with
1,Truly disappointing,"If you are trying to learn about the inside operations, philosophy, dreams, etc. of a company this book is a complete waste of time. If you want to read the random whinings of someone who was a very poor customer service rep then this is the perfect book. All fluff no substance."
1,How long can he spin this out?,"He was a customer service rep answering emails all day, his claims of being a Business Development Hustler are false. The joke in all of this is not the book - it is Mike Daisy himself. What will he do after this?"
4,Only the play was better!,"As an ex-dot commer myself, this book hits the mark on inane corporate culture over and over. The only thing even more brilliant was Mike Daisy's off-Broadway show by the same name. It was painfully funny. If he takes that show on the road (which may happen) don't miss it.CFC"
3,Every former Amazoninan who writes a memoir...,"Seems to be disgruntled. Perhaps I'm not reading all the memoirs, or perhaps that's just what sells. This author guy was in CS, so he answered phones all day, primarily with angry people on the line. No wonder he was disgruntled! Anyhow, this is an interesting insight into ""old Amazon"" - at the time of writing, Amazon hadn't made it into profitability. Things have changed! A lot..."
3,"Amusing, disturbing, and worrysome","This is not a typical startup tale. As I started every new chapter of the book I debated whether it'll be worth the time - I still can't figure out if it was. Mike Daisey documents his adventures at Amazon as a customer support representative, and later a ""Bus. Dev"" manager. Filled with a mix of interesting stories about being on the front lines of a hot startup, juvenile humor, and general, what seems to be, rants of incompetence at his job, this is a tough one to qualify.Having said that, it captures the spirit of the times, and for that, it's an interesting read. Even more so, Amazon has turned out to be quiet a successful company, irrespective of all the irrational exuberance - makes you wonder what changed in the company, or perhaps, maybe all the Mike's left in the meantime?"
3,The author shouldn't have read the audiobook.,"This is a mildly interesting autobiography of the author's stint at Amazon. It mostly is an autobiography, but it is interesting enough to keep listening to. The major problem is the author's voice. It's simply annoying and his reading style is over-dramatic with too much emphasis on odd words. While listening, I couldn't help but think that a professional reader would have done much better with his material.Its hard to describe his voice. It's mostly whiny, with a little pseudo-intellectual in there as well. Objectively, his voice is not pleasant and his tone and inflection are extremely distracting.After awhile, I got used to it, but many or most may not."
3,The early Amazon call centre,If Mike Daisey had worked in customer service at some other dotcom I'm not sure that his account would have been published.Amazon.com and Jeff Bezos have a giant fascination for the public and the J.B. shadow falls over the whole book. Employees are presented as part of a cult and the author even addresses imaginary emails to J.B. to explore their imaginary relationship.From a commercial point of view Amazon has been a big success and the author doesn't at all suggest why this is. I would be much more interested in an autobiography by J.B. himself if one ever arrives.
5,Dilbert gets caught in the dot bomb frenzy,"This is a funny book that will hit home for anybody who has worked at a high-tech startup, and especially one of the dot coms. I am not going to give away spoilers, but let me say that if you work in high-tech, have been a part of a start-up or have suffered the slings and arrows of clueless management you'll see carticatures of those you knew in this wonderful book.Daisey is one great writer and a world class iconoclast (he prefers the term ""dilettante""). Read the book and thank your favorite diety that no matter how bad you have it, it could be worse: you could be selling books over the internet."
4,Slow dance music,From COLUMBIA SPECIAL PRODUCTS comes LOVE TO ROCK 'N' ROLL-- a pleasant little collection of original 1950s and early '60s recordings. The album name is a misnomer as the music really isn't rock & roll; it's ten doo wop ballads-- but that's a plus! Sound quality of transfers is excellent. This budget package has no liner notes.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 26:07
4,Good information,"Good information I just wish I didn't have to do all the math myself!Spiral bound paperback was a surprise,"
2,Expecting better from Johnnie To,"Johnnie To. Andy Lau. This movie adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Transfer is ok looking. The movie looks like it was shot cheaply. Probably was. Wouldn't make a difference if it were any good, which it's not. What could have been an interesting premise quickly goes nowhere. Even the action was subpar. I was very disappointed."
3,Watch it only if you are a hardcore HK movie fan,"Doesn't even come close to a John Woo, Ringo Lam or Tsui Hark film. Some interesting action sequences though - the opening is excellent. I found Andy Lau's acting a little over the top. Also, it seemed that every character was coincidentally related to another character in several ways. 2 rival assasins and one assasin's boss is the brother of the other assasin? A few of these I'll buy but there were way too many unexplained coincidences. I would have preferred a longer film that probed more info the relationships. Don't bother with this unless you are die hard HK fan - there are much better HK films out there."
4,Romantic and Rational Judaism,"David Hartman has applied his considerable intellectual talent to 1) articulate a problem facing contemporary Israel (and much of the Jewish people), 2) explore two medieval thinkers - Yehudah Halevi, the romantic, and Maimonides, the rationalist - regarding their attitudes toward both miracle and messianism, and 3) apply the insights of their two approaches to the current situation. Hartman illustrates the hopeful allure of Halevi, the enduring sobriety of Maimonides, and his own continuing concern for questions of political and social ethics which also characterises contemporary philosophical discussion. Quite worthwhile."
4,Getting Closer To God,"I'm pretty busy. Last year entered 6th grade, and it was pretty nerve wracking. Luckily, it calmed down. But around Christmas, I was searching for things that I wanted on Amazon and saw this book. I put it on my wishlist and my great aunt gave it to me.The first couple of days, I tried to memorize the verses, but I soon gave that up. Even so, this book has good devotions that are both quick and meaningful. The Bible passages are just right, and each morning I get closer to God.If you want to get a good devotions book for girls up to 12, you need to get this book."
5,A WINNER!,"Rachel McLish was the ""woman of the decade"" in the 1980's bodybuilding world. A former world champion, she epitomizes beauty and fitness for women. She is absolutely gorgeous! Her training knowledge, technique, and attitude are inspirational and results oriented for the beginner to advanced. She demonstrates how to make your body the best it can be. The photography enhances the skills for each body part, and the reader can see that while flexing she looks cut, but in a normal state she has a very feminine but toned physique. She is the perfect guide for developing and maintaining muscle fitness!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought a new book and received one that had several pages that were black, as if they were copied too dark.I cannot comment on the book as it was difficult to read due to poor publishing."
1,Parliamentary Procedure at a glance,"I was buying this for our 4-H parliamentarian (10 years old), hoping it was kid friendly.It is still very complicated and am not sure it will meet our needs."
1,vastly disappointed,I loved Jasmine Trias on American Idol and looked forward to hearing an album with her unique voice on it. This album left me very disappointed. All the songs sound the same and there is no change in tempo or beat. Jasmine sound overpowered by the background vocalists sometimes and it left much to be desired.
2,They pushed the Jennifer Lopez card!,"It worked for Jennifer Lopez, but there is only one Jennifer Lopez. It's ok but I've heard it before. And why is it so exspensive compared to other cd's? I mean eighteen dollars? I don't see any signifigance or originality that makes it worth that much more than other cd's. She's a cute kid, and I'm sure she's a nice kid."
5,Fun Album,"This is a fun album, with high-energy dance songs and great ballads too. The songs allow Jasmine's personality to come out. I highly recommend this cd!"
3,Good Value. A little thin for molded plastic.,Nice cargo tray that matches the interior well. It's a thin molded plastic tray which is necessary to fold up (in case you need 3rd row seats). Mine still doesn't lay flat since it came rolled up. I guess I wanted more OEM like thick rubber liner (similar to all season Honda mats). I know they discontinued the Honda cargo liner and I didn't want to spend for a Weathertech so this was a good value.
5,Touching story,"One of Balogh's best. Lovely story with believable characters, believable problems, and best of all touchingly believable conclusion.Eight years previously Judith Easton had jilted the Marquess of Denbigh to elope with another man. Now recently widowed she returns to London, and into the sights of the waiting Marquess. Max has had eight years to plan his subtle revenge. He will worm his way into her heart; shower her with affection and warmth. Then, when she least expects it, he will abandon her without a word. It is a good plan, a perfect plan, but as Max slowly discovers it is very hard to hurt the woman that still holds his heart."
5,Nice classic Lynn Myles,I listened to this on my PSP mixed in with Woody Guthrie and Bruce Cockburn. I liked what I heard. It wasn't really bitting but relaxing and easy going. I also heard some comedy that she sometimes includes. Not as high tension as her friend Alanis Morrisett but still with that edgy relationship and love styled lyrics. It had me dreaming and thinking of love. Overall a good disk to buy.
1,very cheap board,"This board is very cheaply made. The ""wood frame"" is some kind of plastic that resembles wood. The compare price is wildly inflated and the board is not worth what it cost if you include shipping."
5,Unbelieveable Candles,These are the best smelling aromatic candles I have ever used! They burn for hours and nothing is left on the sides of the jar!
3,Votivo Red Current Aromatic Mist,"I love the packaging. Sometimes the old ones would clog and not spray, so far this has been without a glitch, but the aroma is not as strong as the old ones. It was so strong and pungent. Just one small spritz and the red currant diffused everywhere. This is still good, but I'm a little disappointed and am wondering if the company is diluting it."
4,review#857749025-294557485348759024584395987205146835486,"Without pigeonholing them into a catagory, this album seems to be the brige between the old and the new. Dry and haunting, quite cold in texture Death In June have again unleashed an onslought of thought pervoking poetry upon humanity with a vengance. The composition seems to have leaped in complexity but does not sound overdone. The packing shows a good amount of concern in keeping it high quality and closest to the design of the old vynl set of old. Tha fact that this is even on cd is reason enough to buy it, but it really does stand on its own as one of their greatest albums. Two arms high in the sky for this one!"
2,"Good book, but.....","The author is a renowned coin expert and has published many great informational books on the subject. Some of the material is recycled from other works, but my main grievance with the book is it lacks detail regarding counterfeit detection. There is little more than a solid chapter of the book dedicated to the subject of counterfeit detection, yet; this topic is mentioned on the title. Additionally; all that the reader is ever truly explained is how to spot a genuine coin, not how to spot a counterfeit. I understand the approach the author takes towards counterfeit detection; but he should provide a 360 degree analysis on the subject if he is going to include it in the title of the book. The coin grading portion of the book is great for written descriptions, but lacks pictures."
3,Could be better,"The biggest issue I have, actually a couple: needs to be in color for grading parts and the counterfeit parts lacks enough side-by-side comparison. This would be very useful for novices such as myself. The counterfeit part had some side-by-side but overall was lacking. The counterfeit part also needed to be in color. I know colorizing would increase cost but it would have been worth it."
3,Not what I expected,"This is the book originally used to set the standards used by PCGS. I bought it after reading that it was the best on the market. I'm sure it could have been just that but I was very disappointed. The pictures are all in black and white. I use a jewelers loupe, even so, I had great difficulty seeing the supposed differences being brought to my attention. There were interesting articles about counterfeits and coin histories but even then, the book was very specific. It would point out certain coins known to be ones that were counterfeited often but ignored others completely. It did make me somewhat afraid to buy coins, even slabbed coins at auction houses. If that was the books intent, it worked."
3,Early Al Stewart warming towards his best work.,I bought it to complete my collection. It is better that the earlier work but not nearly as good as the future work.
1,Understanding World War I,"This is a simplistic, 20 minutes DVD for elementary children. This fact is not stated anywhere. The price, U$S 59.95, is way out of line."
3,Old Charms Indeed,"Not too bad for a first CD. I just expected a bit more from her as this CD seems a little off. IF you like jazzy type music then this CD is for you. Good to listen to while winding down from a long day. Given her range on the 2004 version of Canadian Idol, I was expecting A LOT MORE. After Canadian Idol 2004, I couldn't wait to see her in concert but after listening to this CD.....not too sure anymore."
2,Idol Chatter,"I fell in love with Theresa during the Idol season and vowed to buy her first release. Well, about the only thing it is better than is Kalen Porter's dreck. Theresa's album is marred by poor production and uninspired backing. I still admire her voice, especially on the first and last songs, but her originals are cringeworthy in the lyric department and, overall, I'm disappointed."
5,Sharp knife,"This knife represents a good value for the money spent. The blade guard fits snugly and serves to protect the edge in a drawer. The knife holds its edge quite well, yet sharpens pretty easily (I use diamond stones). The handle is not teak, as was advertised, but has a nice lacquer finish applied that appears to wear well as long as you don't soak it in the dishwater."
5,Another Gem from the lads,"Once again, the PEST boys blend just about every style of music together and produce something greater than its parts. The clever loops and intricate guitar are never overstated (a common problem I have found with other bands)and, in this case, I found myself laughing out loud at the cheeky use of vocals and wind instruments. All out fall about..Love it, play it"
4,Pest - All Out Fall Out,"Pest's second album, ALL OUT FALL OUT, continues the weirdo funk hip-hop of the first. ""Delucid"" has some warm reggae-inspired horns that contrast the buzzing electronic bass cello line and the guitar plucking, while ""Pat Pong"" starts with a smooth vibraphone and only gets funkier as it goes along. They continually to mix in moments of beauty (the guitar line on ""Click Bitches"") with odd moments (the sampled expletive and the unexpected break on the same). But if there's a major weakness, it's the weak raps that keep turning up like a bad penny (""Wu Ju,"" ""Ogres,"" ""Cous Cous""). Thankfully, these missteps are redeemed by the angular harmonies of ""Downward Steps"" and the intricate bass and strange processed vocal samples on ""Saddlebags."" The twisted jazz of ""Donde Pesta"" carries the Ninja Tune stamp of originality."
3,meh,"I guess this thing is fine. I don't use it as much as I thought I would. Sound quality is pretty poor, but I guess I didn't have high expectations considering the price."
3,"nastalgic, but tricky to figure out","This game was fun for me as a 37 year old , but the fun was sucked up quickly by my 17 year old son who is spoiled by todays games. If you just want to relive a bit of the past it is worth the money. You have to have enough patience to figure out how to work the games. 5 on a scale of 10 for ease in learning ."
1,Missed opportunity,"Unfortunately this is a cheap product that can't replicate the play of the original games. The paddle doesn't have near the sensitivity of the original and because of that the games are largely unplayable.If you want to have fun with classic games, go to a garage sale or ebay and buy yourself the real deal. An Atari VCS with a couple dozen games will likely be cheaper than purchasing this missed opportunity.Great idea, poor execution."
5,cool,I couldn't put this down. A girl works on a heelp line called rapline. When one day she starts getting phone calls. They start off nice then they get threatening. A jealous man is on the other line and he is a killer. He's killing girls and shes scared she may be next.Reviewed By Vikki Car
3,Observation,This copy seems to be about 25% shorter than the original. The Original had autopsy photos of JFK And a lot more details of who was involved in the murder & why it was committed.
1,Poor build quality,"I got this watch as a birthday present and fell in love with it. But my delight did not even last a month. The material used for the strap is very poor quality and since I work with a laptop on a desk, the constant rubbing against the desk caused the silver/gold layer to scratch off revealing an ugly copper core. I had to return the watch back to Tommy Hilfiger and they honoured the return by giving me a full refund.It is unfortunate that they used sub-standard material because the watch design in itself is very classy."
1,"Not a good learning book, not a good reference either.","This book doesn't present topics in logical order for learning. The chapters aren't connected, and they don't explain functions sufficiently. Sucks for learning.Bad for refence too. I.e., looked up CRect, two pages listed. Both are off-hand references to CRect, with no examples of how to implement the CRect class."
1,Confusing...,"This book is extremely confusing and is definately not for beginners. It seems the author had lots to say, but had no clue about how to present it to make it easy to read, or for that matter, for it to even make sense. In the section on MFC alone there were far too many times when the author simply said ""do this"" but never gave any instructions on exactly how to do so! Instead I was left paging through the text aimlessly trying to find the information I was looking for. Infact my favorite quote(paraphrased) out of the book is from chapter 13: ""Therefore it is assumed the reader, as a prerequisite for this section, has already read chapter 19."" I'm sorry, but any book that requires me to jump around between chapters to try and make sense of it is simply a waste of my time."
1,_BUYER BEWARE_ worst programming book I ever bought,"Here's a list of why you should NOT buy this book:* there are a *lot* of errors. Not typos. Errors.* there are pages and pages of code _already included on the CDROM_, which makes the book undeservingly fat* there are countless tables ripped straight from msdn* the chapters don't follow _any kind_ of logical order, and sometimes the authors refer to things they wrote in later chapters!* the text is many times too vague, and makes the assumption that you're already a good MFC programmer and just want to confuse yourself.I've just recently tried to read this book again (probably the third time I've tried) and I'm giving up. It's futile. This is the *worst* computer book I've ever bought, but it has taught me to be more careful with my money....There are better MFC books on Amazon.BUYER BEWARE"
3,pretty good,"This book is good, but I have one little problem with the code examples, Most of them I used have been wrong. Not in a little way either. There syntax errors that a person with a days worth of C++ training could have noticed. I am talking about the code in the book, the code on the CD-ROM is ok. Maybe I got a corrupted version or something. i.e. p.208, there are two in this example. unsigned char pData = new unsigned char [width*height]; //*pdata? . . pData[x*3+y*bm.bmWidthBytes] = 0; // pData[x*3 + y*width?]"
4,Great Book- Not a C++ Tutorial,"This is a great book for expierenced programmers who want to program for windows but don't want to have to memorize 100s of API calls. It is also a great reference on MFC 6.0 programming. Before this book I was clueless on the majority of how Windows worked and this book helped clear the cobbwebs. I especially liked the chapter on explaining how the Graphical Device Interface worked and how to use it.However, the reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the fair amount of errors int the text and in the example code. I also found that finding the errors and pointing them out to myself helped further my understanding of the subject in general.In order to be able read and understand this book, you should have a fairly good understanding of C++ and how computers work(generaly). Enough that you can write fairly complex programs. You should also (of course) have the Visual C++ 6.0 Development Environment."
5,Rookies need not apply!,Definitely the best book by far - especially for experienced developers! I only wish I could more than 5 stars!
2,"Lots of Info, lots of typos, lots of errors","This is actually a pretty poorly written book. It's the only Visual C++ book that I own, and I must say, I got much more mileage out of the online MSDN library than I did looking in here. The only reason that it didn't get 1 star is that certain chapters (Database programming, threads) provide a good basis for experimentation.Far from a bible though..."
1,The book suits for no one,"The ""bible' is designed for everyone but ends up suits for no one. Either the publisher does not know what the authors are writing or the authors do not care about readers. I wish the publisher can give me full refund"
1,if you are trying to learn visual c do not use this book,"this book neveqr mentionewd things which, were apprarently ovious to more experienced win32 programmers, but I'm of the dos generation and this book sucked."
5,my first ant phillips albom,"this was my first venture into the world of anthony phillips, and a wonderful one indeed, one that in fact, kicked off a deep obsession and love affair with his work. i love everything about this album, and the cover was the reason i was interested in it in the first place, with its reminiscence of the mediaeval ""Book of Hours"" painting. the music, on the direct contrary, is a delightful collection of twelve very unusual portraits of each month of the year - very subjective, and very subtle in the shifts, like the passing of the seasons. with so many kitchy portrayals of the seasons, and glib, cliche presentations, it's wholly refreshing to hear a CD that takes an approach to the said seasons in a light that i've never heard before, as a music conoisseur. highly recommended as a first, or fifth, or whatever AP album you like."
3,"Solid, if undistinguished","While being a perfectly solid effort, especially in the playing, the compositions themselves are perhaps a bit on the unmemorable side, perhaps not surprising for a recording of 12 solo acoustic guitar pieces wherein the timbre of the sound is so uniform throughout. Definately one that requires repeated, attentive listenings so as to get a real appriciation for, whereas it may function merely as background music otherwise. Probably not the best place to start for exploring Ant's music; check out the Geese and the Ghost or Back to the Pavillion."
3,Weak novel from a good writer,"Erskine Caldwell did a couple of GREAT novels, a few darned good ones, and a lot of ... Well. He did a lot of bad books. This is one of them.The characters are stereotypes of southerners and the plot is too weak to matter.You may have read TOBACCO ROAD and GOD'S LITTLE ACRE. I recommend JOURNEYMAN and TROUBLE IN JULY.Beyond those four, pick up Caldwell at your own risk."
1,Not my cup of tea,"Ever since I heard the melancholic beauty of If You're Feeling Sinister I have never hesitated to pull out my wallet for the latest Belle and Sebastian release, and until now have never been dissapointed. These three throw away songs are a quirky stew of misguided cliches, and sound like an under produced tribute to Peter Gunn or some forgotten sixties spy soundtrack played for camp. At least that is the impression it made after one listening, which was all I could muster before heading to the nearest used record shop to unload this aberration. My advice would be to skip this release, and head straight for Fold Your Hands Child... (their latest LP) which offers a more subtle change in direction that does not betray their body of work."
3,Trying on styles,"Interesting but not particularly great experimentation guides this tiny output, offering some great and unusual, mostly instrumental moments sporadically on the first two and coasting by well enough on their textbook constructed third. Nothing worth loosing sleep over, but impossible to dismiss."
2,Belle missing Sebastain?,"This single is surely a little different from the rest of their material. They seem to pick up the pace a bit more but not as good as before. The vocals sound less satisfying and the new electric stuff just doesn't sit well. The last track ""Winter..."" is by far the best and is the only plus on it."
4,Belle Slaps One Together,"The Legal Man cd single is a solid effort saved by the title track. ""Legal Man"" is a slice of 60's pop with a bouncy beat and sprightly vocals. ""Judy Is A Slap Dick"" is a fairly weak instrumental and ""Winter Wooksie"" has a sweet melody but tries a little too hard to be cute."
4,BACK TO MONO,"If nothing else, this nutty piece of RetroCheese proves what I've suspected for quite some time now: Belle and Sebastian is the most fearless band on earth. Who else would have the courage to release something so entirely out of character at this crucial stage of their career? And then actually be able to pull it off by having the darned thing rock so hard? I can't think of anyone...."
5,Great stuff!,"Listening to ""Legal Man,"" you wouldn't believe it was recorded only a year ago... very 60s. ""L-O-V-E love, it's coming back, it's coming back. Get out of the office and into the springtime, get out of the city and into the springtime."" Probably the song of 2000."
4,Surprising Yet Infectious,"I have always found a dark and wicked sense of humor in some Belle and Sebastian songs - Legal Man brings out that sense of humor in musical form. According to other interviews with the band, the track was written as a ""jam"" and it has that feel - light, insubstantial, but very musical and very swinging. If you're looking for the tight, insightful songwriting , you may be a little disappointed. But if you're willing to have a little fun, you'll find this ep in your CD player quite often.That last track is a more along the lines of B&S's other songs, though not one of their strongest."
5,TRACK LISTING:,1. Hermosisimo Lucero2. Valentin Felix3. Ramiro Sierra4. Eleodoro Elenes5. Hermanos Quintana6. Baraja de Oro7. Agustin Nava8. Oscar Barraza9. Jose Silva Sanchez10. Rigo Campos
2,Reissue of 1969 release. Not EOE from San Francisco,This is a reissue of a 1969 release on Deram records. I thought it was the NEW San Francisco band East Of Eden. It's not.
5,The best I've found,"Being an avid pool person in the summer I've gone through several types of water chairs. This is by far the best I've ever found. Everyone that comes and shares the pool agrees that it is the most comfortable chair I've ever purchased. It's easy to blow up, has thicker vinyl than most, and requires no effort to be extremely comfortable. I am so glad I bought 2 of them!!!"
2,Good for Kids,"I need a keyboard to fit on my tray for both keyboard and mouse. The standard keyboard is too wide. I thought this one might be a good chose since it is compact:After using it a few days, I learned that this is a good keyboard for kids or someone who has small fingers. It is hard for me to press the keys and ends up getting extra unwanted characters due to ""fat fingers"". Also the Delete button is so small and hard to find. I recommend HP USB Multi-media Keyboard on Amazon for under $20. You can be your own judge by trying it out in the local retail store. The HP USB keyboard is very similar to the standard keyboad except that it is not too wide."
2,"Good Idea, Poor execution","Well, I ordered the book because I thought the premise was somewhat interesting. By chapter three I was so tired of the labored writing I nearly put the book down. Part of me wishes I had. I think the author had a great idea but just couldn't pull it together. Not a polished effort...there should have been more time spent editing the book!"
2,Out Of Print,"This book is currently out of print. It was listed under Xlibris, ""online-publisher"" as is, a draft, no editing and no payment etc. But the book is being reworked and will be republished to come out at the end of 2004, under new publisher."
2,Poor guy doesn't know English,"I tried to read this book because I felt sorry for the author, who actually paid to have his book edited. He probably hit upon an editor who once took English 101 and was totally unqualified to do any editing. The result is a disaster. I could not get through the first chapter, although the story seemed powerful."
5,This album is pure beauty,"This album I listened to in its entirety, and it made my day. I love it. My thanks to the authors because you brought some happiness into the world.And the funny thing is I dont actually listen to this sort of music very much.Buy it no regrets"
5,a gift for you and your children,"Out of print and delightful children's hardback book, with rhythmic prose and wonderful quirky drawings. The orange endpapers also have charming drawings all over them!Highly recommended retro out of print children's book First Edition."
4,Bud's Back,Previously only available in Japan as an RVG Edition CD reissue. This is Bud at his best in my opinion. More modern sounding than the first 2 Amazing Albums on Blue Note. The man had to have the fastest two hands any piano player ever had. Lyrical to the extreme. It's a shame that better technology wasn't available to have recorded a musician like Bud. The sound on every Bud Powell record I have ever heard ranges form unlistenable to just OK. This is one of the better sounding ones. Worth a listen to be sure.
4,Eastern Insight,Unique travel book which provides great insight into Hinduism as well as Eastern Orthodox beliefs through the eyes of the ordinary people. Should be required reading for anyone interested in America's place in the world community.
3,Not so mysterious,"This is the first in a series of novels about a gay reporter Benjamin Justice, who once won and lost the Pulitzer prize. In this story Justice is called back to work to help discover the murderer of a young gay man. The accused is a young Hispanic, who is gay, too. The plot works fine for half the book and then the reader figures out who the murderer is. The climax is not very much fun, since it is all talking. Interspersed with the plot Wilson integrates gay issues in a not-too-heavy handed manner. His writing style is most readable."
1,Heterosexuals will hate this book.,"The author takes a good plot and ruins it by appealing to a gay audience. As a heterosexual I hated this book. I squirmed during the author's description of sexual acts between gay men and the leading character's homosexual thoughts.No, I wouldn't have squirmed if there was a description of sex acts between men and women and if the leading character had heterosexual thoughts about the leading female character! But not being gay, I WAS JUST TURNED OFF BY THIS BOOK! If anything, reading the book may have made me homophobic! I hope not"
4,LA Redemption,"I really enjoyed this book and will try others by author John Morgan Wilson based on what I found here. And what that was in the aggregate amounted to an original plot, evocative setting and thoroughly enjoyable collection of characters. In the latter context, the author has created a protagonist with depth--lots of issues, but humanity and principles--and a supporting cast that is largely multi-dimensional and credible.As a bi-coaster, I found the political and corporate cynicism that enfolds this novel to ring true. Southern California and Washington DC have a lot in common when it comes to facade building and hollow appeals to the public for patronage and support.I'm not going into the plot here as other reviewers have done that pretty well over the years that the book has been out. But I can add that this book will provide challenge and enjoyment to most mystery fans and general readers--gay or straight--alike. Recommended."
4,"What a start for a series, and what a novel ending","I first read JM Wilson's fourth novel and found it well worth going back to the start and getting this first novel. I was very, very impressed with the writing. Read a chapter of ""Simple Justice"" and then one of Grafton's ""S is for Silence"" and you'll get a clear picture of good fiction and interesting sentence structure versus the mundane, dumbed down language increasingly common in American mystery novels. Wilson's writing and characters are just far, far more complicated and interesting than Grafton's.While I could figure out the ending in Wilson's first novel, the last scene is so twisted and captivating that you'll find your eyebrows raised and a ""wow!"" coming from your lips.I'm now into novel 2 of Wilson's and haven't been as excited about discovering a new author to read since I found out about James Lee Burke."
4,"This book will grab you hook, line and sinker.","I don't even like fish, but I thoroughly enjoyed this wide-ranging socio-economic (and gastronomic) study of how one single food source moved people and nations over the centuries. Kurlansky has an engaging style, and combines a sense of humor with a sense of urgency in looking at man's relation to the natural world--or what is left of it. My one quibble is that he looks at evolution in terms of species survival rather than individual survival (might I suggest to Mr. Kurlansky that he dip into The Selfish Gene?). But that is a small quibble. Here is the real history of the exploration and exploitation of the North Atlantic as that greediest of all species spreads its nets ever wider, gobbling up everything in its path"
3,"Cod, who knew!","Good read, however, the author tends to bounce around with the timelines. Although cod was a critical staple product, I doubt it was the center of the universe."
1,Boring,"One of the worst written books I have read in 2 years. The story: for hundreds of years there were a lot of people catching and eating cod, but then they were overfished and there are no longer giant stocks of cod. Now you have no reason to get this book, as the author does not add much to that sentence - but drags it out. A bunch of relatively unrelated fish facts and boring details of random fish stories - but no storytelling ability is present. Dull and repetitive."
3,cod is ok,"good history, although brief, author's writing style was a little cluttered and disconnected which was a little disappointing, some may like the recipes in the book, but that wasn't what I was hoping to learn from the book."
3,MORE THAN A FISH STORY,HISTORY BUFFS WILL APPRECIATE THE EFFECT THAT COD FISH HAD ON THE DEVELOPEMENT AND ECONOMY OF THE WORLD AT LARGE FROM THE EARLIEST RECORDED TIME UNTIL THE PRESENT. A DASH OF INTERESTING RECIPES ADD A LITTLE FLAVOR TO AN OTHERWISE RATHER BLAND BOOK. PROVIDES A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE NEED FOR REGULATION OF THE USE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES.
3,Some interesting history. Quite a few cod recipes.,"Cod is the fish that fueled European exploration of the north Atlantic and this is part of its story.Mark Kurlansky's book begins with material suggesting the collapse of today's cod fishery, then flashes backward. He calls today the end of ""a thousand year fishing spree,"" but really picks up the story of cod in the Fifteenth Century, after just six pages about earlier times.He seems to have no knowledge of the early northern Europeans who fished for cod in the north Atlantic. So his story starts several thousand years too late.He spent some time as a commercial fisherman and he shows an adequate grasp of this part of his subject.There are cod recipes at the ends of his chapters, a special chapter of cod recipes at the end, an interesting bibliography and an index."
3,"A Great Start, But Misses The History In The End","This book starts with a wonderful history of the Cod fisheries in the Atlantic. I enjoyed it, coming from a long line of Cape Code fishermen. However, little is said of the 'battles' with the massive Russian fishing fleets in the '60s and '70s. This lead to most of the destruction of the Grand and George's banks stocks. Also, more fresh (not salted or cured) cod receipes would have been very helpful. Since my family had access to fresh fish, we actually dislike the cured fish."
4,Reminds us that history is often made by economics,"The author presents a readable overview of a fish that really did change the world. Kurlansky shows that while ""great men"" often drive history, resources and economics dictate the range of their choices and as often as not give a strong clue as to the probable direction of events.That said, this book gives tantalizing views of one of mankind's toughest and most dangerous industries - fishing. The reader may well appreciate the juxtaposition of gritty cod town life and the movement of nations in search of this most perfect food source. The book moves along quickly."
5,An enjoyable book - For history buffs a must read,"A sincerely interesting book about the role this fish has played over the course of history. A wonderful tie in to American history (Pilgrims landing in Plymouth, and John Adams!) A lite easy read, perfect for the summer."
5,"I hate fish, but I loved this book","This book was excellent. Kurlansky has taken a modest topic and followed it into all aspects of its existence and history. It is not too often that you read a book that changes the way you think about something you hate. The storytelling in this book was absolutely first rate, as it wove its tale of a fish that allowed colonization of distant places, and as a resource that people continue to battle over today. I could have done without all of the recipes, but they do add a sense of urgency to the necessity of saving our oceans for the fish, and not overusing our resources.Thank you Mr. Kurlansky, and I look forward to your future efforts."
4,Market economics caused an immense disaster.,"Darwinian science declared that cod - for centuries a basic global food source - could never become extinct. But predictable and preventable market response made rather quick work of a once indispensable species. Kurlansky's scrupulous and almost impassioned explanation should be obligatory reading for citizens young and old, and certainly for teachers and people aspiring to public office. Almost incidentally he rewrites the history of the American revolution. I have to admit, though, that parts of the account decreased my appetite for codfish cakes."
3,Good but not great,"This book does a very good job of giving a brief overview of commercial cod fishing in the Atlantic and European waters. Be forewarned: at least a full one-third of this book is on cooking cod. Not only is the last section (which is rather large) on cooking cod, but cod recipes are interspersed throughout the chapters. This really leaves the reader feeling like much of the book is fluff material. I would recommend reading it but I would not recommend spending your money on a new version; buy a cheap used one if you can."
4,"Strange, whimsical biography of a fish","Mark Kurlansky has made something of a reputation for himself, writing whimsical histories of things which usually don't merit books. His first book in this vein, Salt, was something of a bestseller, and he's written a book on oysters since the current volume. However, today we're writing about Cod, a book which recounts the harvesting, or fishing, of a species of fish mostly from the Atlantic Ocean.Kurlansky spends most of the book recounting how these fish are caught, prepared, and consumed. The author spends considerable time dealing with the issues of over-fishing, the various controversies surrounding the ownership of the schools and shoals of fish. Each chapter concludes with a short section on preparing the fish, usually including an actual recipe, often from long ago.I enjoyed this book. I found it unusual, perhaps even unique, and it's a fresh look at history from a really different angle."
4,Cod - the passenger pigeon of the sea?,"More than most people would need or want to know about the fish that launched a thousand ships, Cod is the logical conclusion to Mark Kurlansky's saga of the Basques and Salt. The trilogy should be read in total to appreciate not only the industry and people who fished, but the depth of research and devotion of the author."
4,Wonderful premise,"I loved this book. It is history, ichthyology anthropology, everything in one wonderful book. Fascinating, well done."
3,Not what I expected,When I ordered this book I thought it was going to contain study information somewhat like a text book. However it does not. It is just practice test questions for you to study with. The book is useful for sure but not if you are expecting to read it like a text book. It is just test questions and in my opinion the answers could have been a little more detailed in some cases. If you are looking for practice taking your CST exam it's great for that.
3,It Works,"I bought this book used here on Amazon and recently took the test. This was the only study guide I used. I tried to study beyond the multiple choice questions and detailed answers by learning more about the subjects on the internet.Out of 200, I scored a 132 (119 was passing). If I had been a little more diligent and known the guide like the back of my hand, I could have probably scored 150.(Your results may vary since they administer numerous versions of the test.)I only gave it 3 stars since there were several errors in the guide, particularly towards the end of the book. They should spend more time on proofreading for the next edition."
5,Very pleased!!!,The first time I took the test only with what came with my text book. All I know is that I passed the test the second time around with flying colors!!! Thank God!!!
2,Beware!,I have used other volumes of this book in years past. In this particular volume there are far too many mistakes to recommend it very highly.
3,GREAT SET!!! With a Twist...,"The mallets, wickets, stakes, and carrying bag are of INCREDIBLE quality, the balls on the other hand fall VERY short. The balls, and paint, began to chip after one game :( . Now the green ball has a large chunk taken out of side, and it is effecting play. The other balls are more visually damaged, because mainly the paint is only chipped. I love the high quality mallets, and after only owning the set for a week, its annoying to already be ordering new balls."
1,They should told us that this is a product catalogue,"Buyer beware. This is not a compilation DVD. This is actually a product catalogue. 75-80% of the performer didn't make it through the end of the song. Some lasts at the intro (the Billy Cobham's drum solo/intro, and they lists all the Cobham's band member that barely played any single not at all). Although the artists delivered incredible performances, I still really really totally dissapointed with this DVD. So, buy it only if you need a preview/catalogue of the TDK DVD products. Otherwise, a big NO..."
2,dissappointed,I was very disappointed that this had corn in the ingredients when received. Item did not state it had that in it.
1,more fertilizer from the schlockmeister,this guy is not qualified to have mowed coltrane's grass. everything that is bad about easy listening jazz can be summed up in one word...kenny g... and the g stands for god-awful.
4,Paradise is beautiful,"People keep complaining that Kenny G isn't real jazz. What is ""real jazz"" and who cares if he's not it, or he can't play in key? In my opinion, this CD is great and whatever floats his boat sounds good to me.The song Paradise is amazing. It has a sad, noncholant feel to it and is worth the whole CD.Enough said : )"
1,AHHHHH! STOP THE MADNESS!,"Kenny G is horrible, don't buy this, It's a waste of your money, go buy something good, or download something lol"
1,kenny g plays flat,"kenny g plays flat(not in key), that's why his sound is so distinctive, that's how you know it's him. the general public doesn't care that he can't play in key!!!"
1,Actually deserves -1 stars,"This is true mindless pap for the mindless minions. Kenny G isn't a jazz musician. Instead he's got the musical expertise and integrity of a high school sophmore. I'd sooner listen to the white noise from my TV than this unadultrated garbage. Yes, I know he laughs all the way to the bank.This is appropriate as background dentist office musac. Actually I'd sooner hear the drill!"
5,Excellent album,"Cans brings out the voice of Joacim Cans, lead singer of Hammerfall.Excellent album."
2,Great voice weak cd,"Theres no doubt this guy can sing I saw Hammerfall live and still have flashbacks. So a solo project is going to be differant. I guess it is to differant for me. I only like 1 song on this cd ""soul collector"" everything else does nothing for me. I just reviewed the newest Hammerfall cd and this cd is very similar. So if you like this go for the new Hammerfall. But if your a fan of ""legacy of kings"" or ""renegade"" avoid both these."
3,The Gift: A Novel,"I adored "" Snow in August"" and wanted to read more of Pete Hamill's work. This book did not move me like others of his work. It seemed angry, and at times hostile. I can't say I would not recomment it, but it was not as spellbinding as some of the others."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I am a huge fan of Pete Hamill having read North River and Snow in August. The Gift was one that I had not read and since I was choosing a book for my December Book Club that seemed appropriate and not too complicated I chose this book based on the Amazon promos on their web-site. I should have done some research before selecting the book. The book was well written and the characters were correct for the setting, but just not appropriate for my book club. This might be a perfect book for the Young Adult genre. The theme is universal, but we will be lighting Chanukah candles and celebrating Chanukah on the evening the book club meets."
2,Disappointing Book,I love Pete Hamill and was looking forward to reading another of his stories about New York at Christmas time. This was a major disappointment.
3,The Mind of a Drinker,"Pete Hamill's little book was indeed a gift for this grown daughter of an alcoholic in that it allowed a peek into the world, and more importantly the whys, of barrooms. Somebody finally captured the allure of time spent with drinking buddies instead of family on Christmas Eve. Some ""Dads"" are indeed proud of their families, but their condition allows them to share that only with other people who don't care. Pitiable, but true. Very short story which left a strong impression."
4,Touching novella,"Beautiful descriptions of old Brooklyn in the early fifties--an era which still had some residual impact on my childhood in the sixties. It was a more innocent era, particularly the descriptions of the teenage lustful sexual yearnings, seldom satisfied, but nearly always colorfully described. The writing is a little uneven, but I found the ending to be very touching. A small gem, fitting to read at Christmas time. It made me want to seek out more works by the author."
4,Enjoyed it greatly!,"This book challenges the presuppositions of Scripture interpretation. It caught me by surprise that a Methodist minister wrote this book, considering the lack of concern for scripture in the Methodist church today. Knowing Phil has come at a great blessing for me and reading his book has given me insight as to how I interpret Scripture."
4,have large data sets?,"As computer usage keeps increasing, the amount of data being stored on disks worldwide also rises. Many terabytes by now, if not a petabyte or two.Companies often have gigabytes of data that need to be analysed. This book is a very useful compendium of techniques that can be applied to the data. Because it may be that a sophisticated understanding of your data is a strategic advantage to your company. If not a core competence.The book covers data in many different fields. From financial, engineering, medical and even bioinformatic. The methods applied to these data span the gamut from Artificial Intelligence to neural networks. While some methods are specific to the type of data being studied, the astute reader may be able to modify these for her own situation."
1,Waste of money.,"Both bulbs blew out within 4 months time. They were brighter than stock Honda lamps. But, obviously didn't last long. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money."
5,New take on old story,"I bought this book to include in a literature unit on Cinderella stories for my second grade class. They loved it. The story was especially fun for us in Oklahoma. Cindy is much more like my girls and the events are more familiar. They don't go to balls or fancy parties yet, but they sure know about rodeos and bar-b-ques.Any teacher doing Cinderella stories must have this one."
5,Cinderella for Everyone,"I read this book with my daughters at the public library one day and started looking to buy it from that moment! While my daughters loved it -- I think I liked it more! It is even better if you can read it aloud with a drawl and a western accent. When one of my daughters was in the first grade, they had Dads take turns coming in and reading a couple of books to the children. Some of the boys began to complain when they thought I was going to read them a Cinderella story . . . but by the end of the book, they were fans, too! (Since I don't have any sons, that is the best I can offer from a boys' perspective.)A great book for everyone!"
5,TV FUN,"I LOVE THE GAME AND SO DO MY SON I KEEPS HIM ENTERTAIN FR HOURS , HE HAD FRIENDSOVER AND TE WANTS ONE THEY LOVE IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE SPORTS GAMES ON IT. THANKSTO THE MAKER . I ENJOY PLAYING IT MYSELF"
1,Boring,The movie was just about two people reading love letters to each other. The only nice twist to it was that the man later knew about the value of the woman when she was already gone.
5,OH MY GOSH!,"I saw this first as a play in Mpls. I was so blown away by it and how much it hit a part of me I didn't know I had. I found the play in writing and have enjoyed it time and time again. Now, I am so excited about the movie! It is one you just can't stop enjoying. My husband can never get enough ""Top Gun"" for me it's ""Love Letters""."
2,My first negative review of a current work,"This book is mistitled. It is straight, mainstream history with little that is any more wierd than history generally is. Because of that, I think it verges on false product labelling. It gets 2 stars instead of one as the history that is contained in it is interesting and well written.The personal memories of a participant in various portions of history are not strange in any way. They are, in fact, the basis for much that is written as history. I am content that the book has some value to me as a student of our civilization, but do feel that the average reader will find it dry as dust.If you are looking for a book that has a humorous approach to the subject, look elsewhere. Yes, I found a laugh or two in it, but I have been known to break up while reading Plato."
2,Weird Book,"If you know nothing about history - and are looking for something for the bathroom, this book might be okay. The articles are short. A few are humorous. It won't task your brain.But if you're even mildly serious about history, you won't like this book. Many of the stories appear without reference. And when a reference IS cited, it's frequently the Encyclopedia Americana or World Book. (I'm serious.)Furthermore, the author's political/social agenda overlays the pages like a fog."
3,not as fun for my kids as I thought,"I puchased three of these for each of my young kids last year and thought they would really like them. However, they hang around more than they get played with. They are nice because the ropes don't tangle like other marionettes though. Not sure why, but unfortunately, these were not a hit with my kids."
3,not good as a marrionette,The strings are too long for this to work well. my daughter loves marrionettes but this one you can't make dance/move very well. the strings on the legs are too long. she does like to carry it around. I might just cut the strings off and she can have it as a stuffed animal. it is super soft and cuddly.
1,INCOMPLETE ITEM!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!,I bought this item because it says BOOK AND CARDS. NOT TRUE! I received only the book. I'm missing the cards!!!
2,"Wonderful book, but where are my cards?","The book is very easy to follow and informative. However, it did not come with cards as described. I had to go out and buy a separate deck."
5,cookie's books,I love this site. She has everything you want and more. Will be back.Cookie (Claudia)
3,Great Concept,"Loved the ""what-if"" aspect of the story that is what if one of Hitler's super-subs had actually made it into the war before the Nazi surrender. The technical details of the story are sharp and intriguing. However, the human elements of the story are a little flat. The characters are primarily too stereotypical and as a reader I kept asking myself, ""why do I can about this guy?"" The subplot concerning the U-boat captain's love interests doesn't work well at all.With Honour in Battle is still worth a read despite the flaws. McDaniel's speculations on how a Nazi super-sub would have affected the war are quite compelling."
5,Focusing on Who's important,"I have enjoyed the depth with which Steven has written about his Lenten journey. I appreciate all the people of faith that he has drawn from. He is well read, and the book shows that he not only is, but has done his own searching and finding in his relationship with Christ. I am looking forward to following the book through Lent and expect it to draw me to Who is important, Jesus Christ."
5,Very True to life.,"I could so relate to these characters. I saw every aspect of this story in my mission service in England. Not really a comedy as stated in discription of the film, other than life is a comedy.A moving story about devotion to God, and coming to grips with the reasons why we believe and why we chose to serve. A true to life view of the four archetypical kinds of missioneries."
4,Great movie to share your faith!,"I really love this movie, and amazingly my non-LDS family members like it too. They finally understand why young men would give up 2 years of their life and ride around on bicycles to spread the Gospel.I think The Best Two Years is much easier for non-members to follow and get the humor of then other LDS films (RM, Singles Ward, Home Teachers)."
5,Great work,"Along with Saints and Soldiers, this is one of the better films put out by the LDS filmmakers. This one, not like most of the LDS films, is able to carry a strong message."
5,Best Two years,"A very great family movie. Good language, and nice humor. It is a wonderful , interesting movie about life in a foreign country, dealing with people and uneventful circumstances, and life for Elders in the Mormon church.I am not a Mormon, but this is a sure great movie..Theres a lot you can and will learn from this movie. You can even use it a ""movie and discussion or Bible study"".Buy it, c`mon buy it! you`ll love it,trust me"
4,Amazon offers great book for the Thanksgiving meltdown,I had seen this LDS movie on television and really liked it. I had no luck in finding it until I checked Amazon... surprised and pleased to find that the price was reasonable and I could receive it before the Thanksgiving holiday. Even the squirmy grandchildren watched it without complaint.
5,Great movie and life inspiring!!,This movie is really great and funny and real inspiring and this Elder Rogers having is faith restored in the mission and praying again. We all have low points and high points of faith.
1,Doesn't Work On A Couch.,It is impossible to use this table on my couch. This is to be used with a chair in order to work ...at which point I may as well sit at the dining table!It is cheaply built and made of plastic and metal. I'm afraid I was disappointed.
3,Nice looking but Shaky,"Overall opinion, the legs slide nicely under furniture but they do not fold, so you end up having to keep it somewhere in your house where the legs don't obnoxiously stick out. The product is very shaky and made of cheap plastic, so get ready to feed your loved one or yourself a light snack, forget a dinner plate unless you want a hot mess on your shirt and pants. It's a cheaply made product but I gave it three stars because it will serve the purpose if you have someone sick that can't constantly get up for meals and you want to give a quick snack or drink. If you intend on using this daily I would say go for the more expensive wood table that folds nicely and can be tucked away behind a piece of furniture. In the end, made in China stinks."
2,Poor quality and looks to match,"Small, light tables like this one are very convenient for an impromptu laptop stand.I've had the Table-Mate II for a couple of weeks. It is warped across the middle from just the weight of an average 15"" laptop. It is very cheap and plasticky looking (brown plastic is upposed to be woodgrain?) and is branded TABLE-MATE II across the back in large letters."
2,Don't use for laptop,"I bought this primarily to use with my laptop. It might be ok to use laid flat, but beware if you use the tilt top, my laptop fell to the floor with a thud. Even though it has a raised edge, beware of leaving your laptop on the tilt top."
3,Functional,"Well, I must be getting old. I remember Grandma's TV tray could knock her poodle across the room like a pitching wedge. These probably won't be able to. They work... they hold your plate of food.. reasonably easy to setup. But I always feel like I'm gonna tweak or break them if I set anything substantial on them or work on the steak too much. Too much sway I guess."
2,"ugly, ugly but useful table","This table is useful but very ugly. Functionally, they could improve it by increasing the vertical range. As is, it can't accommodate a high seating position. Repeating myself here, but this is one ugly table. The wood grain is so fake and cheap looking, it reminds me of the walnut vinyl grain elevator cabs from the 70's. It would cost the manufacturer maybe a penny more to invest in good, compelling design. I use it but try not to look at it too much and stow it out of sight."
2,Not sturdy,tray comes apart too easily. Bought for an elderly person and it couldn't be moved around without coming apart. We needed to duct tape it so it wouldn't collapse.
4,Sturdy and well made,"This table is handy, sturdy and looks nice. Because of the style, it is never going to be as sturdy as a regular table with four legs on the floor. But it certainly does what I bought it to do. I set my Kindle on it. So don't know how it would do with heavy things on it, but for what I wanted, it's just right."
1,Yuck,"Looks cheap, doesn't fold up easily, should sell for $9.95 (for two). If you are buying for a senior, forget it."
2,Warps eventually,"Looked liked a great deal for the price, but I should have heeded the advice of other reviewers....it WILL eventually warp and sag in the middle. Stains easily and all in all, is a very low quality product. My advice would be to spend a little extra and get a wood table...even if most models tend to come packaged as multiple quantities."
3,"Decent table, could be better","The table is a little flimsier than I had expected. And it does not lock into any position, so when moving it around the bar that sets the angle of the table top tends to fall out of the grooves and the table flops straight down. Also does not come with the cup holder as shown in the picture. It does the job you just have to be careful when sliding it around (pull on the legs not the table top!)."
4,Serves its purpose,"Product as described. Nothing fancy, but the price explains it. It serves my purpose which is working on my laptop outside in the backyard. Very light weight, so moving it in and out is a breeze. Not good for heavy objects."
5,We Love this Table!,"We've had a white Table Mate II for years for our laptop, and it has served us well. We decided to upgrade to the woodgrain color for our living room and use our white one in our bedroom. We've been very pleased with this one as well. Yes, they can bow a bit in the middle over time (my husband likes to lean on it too hard!), but it's a great little table for various uses. This one has the cup holder on the underside, but we don't use that. Nice extra feature though."
5,Very convenient!,Have a few! Use these tables in the living room as work tables; eat tables; and for whenever we need a temporary table in any room.
5,Great Table,"I had to replace the little table I had been using. It was falling apart. This table is good. It moves easily and is bigger than the one I had.I like that you can adjust the top of the table. The table is pretty sturdy but you do have to watch what you are putting on it. You can not have something real heavy on it, especially toward the edge of it. It will support a plate of food and something to drink.I use it for doing my word search puzzles and it holds up fine.I like this table and I am glad I bought it."
3,Does the job I wanted it for,Fine for my laptop but not like my original one bought years ago. Not as sturdy but as I said it does what I bought it for. Arrived on time/
4,computer table,"I needed something light, adjustable and inexpensive for my mom's new laptop computer. She has liked having it in her tv room."
4,Nice item,"I like it.. Simple to put together and just what I needed. I just wanted something to sit next to my big chair to hold snacks, coffee etc. Happy Camper"
3,Item works for simple things,"For me, it works as a side table to eat on around my computer or around the dinner table to hold an extra plate. True its not very stable and yes it does warp but that depends on how heavy things are being put on the table. For its price and its concept, you can't expect it to function as an actual sturdy table but it suits my simple food needs.Side note: never used the drink holder, that part looks very flimsy/unstable."
4,Just what I needed,"The table was easy to assemble, and is sturdy enough for my use, which is to eat from, as well as do minor tasks such as sort through papers. Happy with the purchase. It is portable too."
1,Junk,I returned this item. I have the same item in white that I have used for years but the legs are rusting and leaving marks on my tile. I got the brown this time and it was a mess. Immediately left brown marks all over the floor and it was warped.
2,Flimsy,"I purchased this tray the idea of using it as a TV tray. The product was almost useless as it wasn't stable enough. I sent mine back, but if you use it be sure to be very careful."
3,wanted cup holder,"I thought i was getting the ones with cup holder, but not so. Otherwise they work ok for what we need"
4,Exactly what I needed,Pros-Easy assembly.Sturdy.Very customizableCons-Wish it was more modern looking.Looks cheap with faux wood grainWould have paid double if I could have gotten in chrome and black or all black
5,My mom loves it.,"I purchased this table for my elderly mother who is confined to a wheelchair. I am completely satisfied with the table, and Mom loves it. I think it was her favorite Christmas presnt. It's light enough so that is easy for her to move it back and forth, but sturdy enough to hold her books, dishes, TV remote controls, etc. it was very easy to assemble - no tools needed. I highly recommend this product."
5,Worth it~,"I found this gem at Ross for only $14 but they only had 1 left. I loved the ""table mate"" so much, I paid double the price online. The legs are only about an inch in diameter so I can pull the table all the way to my chest while sitting on the coach."
5,nice and sturdy,"Great table! Bought for my son-in-law for Christmas and he loves it. He was so happy, that he bought one for his wife after Christmas. Seems to be the solution for long term use of computer. Also, I have a short lap and lap desk is always sagging. Goning to get one for myself too!!"
1,Garbage,"This item is a piece of junk, garbage. Dangerously unstable to support my expensive laptop. TV trays from the 60's were built better. No warantee, guarantee or assembly instructions. If you have the mechanical ablility of an 8 year old, you couldfigure out assembly, as I did. I immediately took it to the spare bedroom, put it in the closet, until such time that a can dispose of it."
2,"looks like cheap plastic, embarrassed to have this in my home","Sorry but, even though the table might work, do NOT buy this expecting it to blend in with the other furniture in your house. It looks like cheap molded plastic with a silly logo on the front to let everyone know its not a real piece of furniture.I thought it would like like actual wood, at least enough to blend in when pushed aside in the corner of the room when I'm not using it, but frankly, it was too embarrassing-looking, even from afar. It honestly looks like it belongs in a hospital or a nursing home."
3,"Convenient, but comes ""unfastened"" easily","Great product, but they need to improve the locking mechanism on the underside. If you pick the tray up wrong, you could easily unlock it and then your contents will dump on your lap."
4,Does the job,"I bought the Table-mate II based on the reviews here and I'm glad I did. It is always out and ready to go to work, holding my laptop or my meals. (Okay. I'm a couch potato.) A couple of reviewers thought it was too weak and unstable but I haven't found that, at all. I rest my wrists on it while typing and its quite solid.I have found it a bit harder than I expected to change the height, not something accomplished in a second. I settled on a height that works best for me and leave it there.After searching for a laptop table for a quite a while, I'm pleased I found this. We ordered a second, two weeks after the first."
4,Table-mate II,"Recently bought two Table-mate IIs to replace the very old and worn TV trays we were using. They were very easy to put together and although they are not beautiful, they are attractive enough for everyday use. They wipe clean easily, and best of all they adjust to the height of chair we are using. I'm glad I found them."
4,Great table for what I need.,"I give it 4 stars for price, it's a bit more than what I'd pay. I don't know what they were thinking when they say this table will support up to 50lbs. I would avoid putting anything more than 10lbs (evenly across the table) on it if you want the thing to last. However beside those, I think it's a great table and was exactly what I am looking for."
4,Does The Job (mine doesn't sag or warp),"I'm not sure if this table has been improved since the negative reviews claiming it sags or warps, but with an reasonable amount of weight on it, mine is just fine. If you stack a dozen text books or something on it, yeah, it might have problems. But for a laptop, your dinner, or as something to clamp a gaming steering wheel to, it works as well as can be expected. It's not going to win any style awards as it would be right at home at Grandma's place. But it's functional."
2,table review,"the table are very flimzy are can easily slip out of the clip underneath. I am really sorry I bought them. I had purchased tables before that looked similar for my grandchildren, but were much more sturdy, I thought I was buying the same product."
1,Not that good,"Although it makes it convenient to have my laptop handy, the tray has started to warp from the weight of the laptop."
2,Sagger,I bought 2 of these tables. With less then 5# of med supplies kept on them.I used each table for 2 weeks. They both saged in the middle. When theLargest piece was in the left hand top side. I couldn't find where to get anySupport to help with this problem.
2,Table Mate II,I bought this table for my Wife to use as She takes most of her meals in her chair and this table would slide much easier than a four legged TV table. This is a poor product as the top was warped and sagged on the right hand corner and you could not set a glass on the corner for fear it would fall off. There is no catch to keep the table from collapsing if you picked it up by the front as it dumps everything. This is a poor product do not buy. Dyterdee.
2,Overpriced,"This item is very cheaply made. Way overpriced for what you get. It should cost about half of what it does. That said, it moderately functions for what I need it to, but I would never have purchased this item if I could have seen it in person first."
2,Not so super group,"Fans of Tabor will be happy, but essentially this is only slightly more proggy, lesser King's X, for little better and lot worse."
5,suberb,I like myself a good Coldplay or U2 anyday. But nothing beats the bluesybeetlesque feel of a good Ty Tabor project.
3,Could have been a really great story,"This collection has a couple of its moment and the story starts off great but sadly, dwindles in the middle due to the appearance of too many players. All of a sudden, Spoiler, Canary and many other memebers of the Bat-family jumps in and causes major confusion of a great story. But despite that, the stories are decent, particularly the ones where Bruce Wayne is in jail and has no more masks to hide behind. And the final story is any comic-readers dream when Batman goes toe-to-toe w/ his former partner. This story takes a disturbing look at the man behind the mask and despite all the problems that he has faced head-on, Batman decides to run from this one."
5,Great Book!,"This book is very good. It gets off to a great start with Batman: The 10 Cent Adventure, then explores other members of the Bat-Family's Point of Views. One of the best issues is Batman #599, part 7 of Bruce Wayne: Murderer. It shows how Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman feels in a prison cell. The best issue, though, is Batman #600. It's the last issue in this TPB. I won't tell you much about this issue because that would be spoiling a lot. So go out and get this book!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"If you add together Greg Rucka and Ed Brubarer you should get a decentstory, and that is definitely the case here. When Batman and SashaBordeaux come back after being out, it seems that Bruce Wayne is wantedfor murder, and will end up in prison.This leads to those around Bruce wondering if he actually could have stepped over the line."
4,"spotty, but worth getting","The concept is intriguing, but the mish-mash of all the Bat-titles doesn't quite work, here's why:There are a pile of writers on this, so there isn't really a single vision for the tone of the book. All of the Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker (writers) parts are fantastic. They both cover the inside-the-prison parts of the story, very well done. The Batgirl and Robin chapters are really poor. Cheesy writing with manga style art. The Nightwing chapters (written by Chuck Dixon) are just so-so. Luckily Brubaker wrote the final chapter, the best part.It's a shame that Ed Brubaker is leaving DC for good (he signed exclusively with Marvel). His work on Catwoman, Gotham Central, and Sleeper has been amazing (buy these!). Luckily, Rucka is staying around.So this book gets 4 stars from me because of these two writers. I used to think Chuck Dixon was OK, but seeing him side by side with these guys makes me think he should take some pointers from them."
4,CD in a Box,"I purchased my copy on sale, the original cost is $3.00 more than the normal non-eco friendly CD with the plastic case. I was dissapointed that it did not have the liner notes and it seems to be just a CD in box...no thrills. Looking back if this was not on sale for $3.00 cheaper than the normal non-eco friendly CD I would have been very disappointed."
5,A Great Voice and a Great Collection,"I have loved McBride for a long time, but never was inspired to buy any of her albums except ""Evolution."" When I saw she had a greatest hits coming out, however, I knew it would be a must have and I was right. Martina hits every note perfectly and the music is perfect on every track. I won't even do a track by track because they are all wonderful. A country classic."
5,Addicting,"This is the first album by Martina I ever bought, and the whole thing is so good! (Of course it should be, being a Greatest Hits album!) This is one of those albums I can't get enough of, it's so good and fun to sing along with!"
4,Concrete Angel: Something Everyone Should Hear,"The song 'Concrete Angel' touched me in a way that few songs have; this is a review of that song.I normally do not listen to country music, but this video was on the TV at the gym one day and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind since. 'Concrete Angel' really drives home the horror of child abuse. It has a beautiful melody, but more than that it conveys (as well as a music video can) the situation of so many kids who are in abusive environments.Since I first heard 'Concrete Angel', I've sampled several of Martina's other songs including 'Independence Day' and have been impressed by her clear vocals and straightforward lyrics. Kudos to Martina for using her venerable vocal talents to address real, tough social issues. I am looking forward to purchasing her 'Greatest Hits'."
5,THE SEXY COUNTRY SOPRANO SHINES-BRIGHTLY!,"This is one great list of greatest hits!She is one sexy siren of country music.This is a great reflection of what she has given us so far. Songs like WHEN GOD FEARIN' WOMEN GET THE BLUES (good ole down and dirty Hill Billy country), BLESSED, CONCRETE ANGEL & WHERE WOULD YOU BE (bone chilling great-what a voice).In the realm of greatest hits, this surpasses all others; country or otherwise. She is one grand diva of country music. She is definitely a living legend.<BRBR>This is a great cd to have if you love country music and especially Martina."
4,Greatest hits Martina McBride,"I really like the songs ""Wrong Again"", Indenpence Day"", and ""A Broken Wing"". She has a young womans voice between Lorreta Lynn and Patsy Cline.Recommend it to all who loves easy country."
5,What a versatile talent!,"Ms. McBride shows her vast ability on serious ballads such as the dark ""Independence Day"" and the fun ""My Baby Loves Me."" This album is indeed a...well, a Greatest Hits album! A must for Martina fans!"
4,Excellent Listening!,I kept hearing Independence Day on Sean Hannity so went searching for her. I'm happy discovering a overall excellent listening CD.
5,Wow - Angels do sing on earth,"Martina has one of the most beautiful voices in country music today. Matched with a great selection of songs and you have a great album. This is a ""must have"" selection for anyone who likes a little bit o' country with a little bit o' rock & roll."
2,OK CD VERY SLOW,THIS CD IS NOT MARTINAS BEST. I LIKE HER A LITTLE SO FOR ME I GUESS ITS THE FACT OF NOT BEING A BIG FAN. MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD IS CONCRETE ANGEL.
1,Waste of money,I felt like this album was a waste of money because you have to buy the whole album just for a few new songs. It's not really fair to have to buy the whole album when most of the songs are repeated on other albums that I've already purchased.
1,Oh brother !!!! Beat Happening all over again ...,All of you thirty-somethings out there know what I'm talking about...Adam Green + Moldy Peaches = teenage Beat Happening
1,pretty worthless,"if you want funny buy ween, if you want lo-fi pop buy the vaselines, this stuff is just dull. this is one of those rare albums that finds success because some ""cool"" kid told the rest of his kingdom that this album was good and no one dared question his taste. i couldn't make it through 30 seconds of each song. some other bands are immature and funny, these guys are just immature."
5,So good.,Years from now people are gonna look back and say this was the mad note. So good. There is nothing else like this. I'm gonna go cry now.
1,The fine line between clever and stupid...,"The 2001 Dumb Luck Award has to go to these New York hacks.Basically mining the same territory Beck did nearly a decade ago (with far less impressive results), these self-proclaimed ""anti-folkies"" are pretty much lowering the standard for independent music everywhere.In an age where low-fi drivel like ""Who's got The Crack"" can make it on to a internationally distributed album, one is led to believe that anyone with a Fisher-Price tape recorder and a busted kazoo can make it.Enjoy those 15 minutes Moldy Peaches, you can't ride The Strokes's coattails forever."
1,beyond pathetic...,"...if you enjoy this band, you are obviously a masochist. If you don't personally know at least 2 bands that sound exactly like this, you are either old or need to get out more. Once again, the emperor is going au'naturale... At least The Strokes are mediocre! Listen to Violent Femmes, The Frogs, old Ween, old Beck, early Zappa, The Fuggs, David Peel and the Lower East Side, or even Tenacious D before giving this band the time of day! Or just go out and talk to some of those kids you see in Tompkins Square Park: I'd wager that at least 2 out of every 5 probably write songs as good or better than this tripe. uck."
4,so bad its good,"i saw and heard this band for the first time opening for the strokes two years or so back. they were so awful that they were good. sort of like enid says in ghost world, ""This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again."". then when i listen a little more you can hear that they are just making music and having fun. 'steak for chicken' is a great song, i love the dualing vocals. the sad and dreary use of the 'low rider' riff on 'jorge regula' evokes strange feelings, and any feeling evoked is something. might be kind of jokey music, but being serious all the time will wear you down. kick your shoes off and enjoy."
3,Not Bad,"This, in and of itself, is not a bad story. However, when held next to the saga so far, it kind of lacks something. The first 5 volumes I couldn't put down. This one I had to make myself read."
4,Key Chain Remote,"Because this is a mini remote it can be difficult programming the code. The parts are much smaller than the standard remote. I had to use a paperclip to program. Otherwise, the product works great."
5,Great replacement opener,"At $15 it's worth having a few lying around in case you lose or misplace your opener. I thought it was super easy to program with a paper clip although the pins are super tiny, as long as you still have your vision, it shouldn't be a problem :)I haven't tried adding it to a key ring like others have mentioned, I just keep it in a little cubby hole in my car within easy reach to use. With that said, I can see how the key ring holder piece may break easily over time, but if you're just keeping this in your car it's perfect."
2,"Great little relote, but not good for a keychain",One of the two openers broke off my key chain within 10 days of receiving it.The remote feel when it was taken out of my pocket and te case broke open.The remote worked jst fine but the case needs some help (toughening upsome to survive pocket use)
5,Works as advertised,Easy to program. Works over 30 ft. Use it for work and attached to my work bag. Works great and cheaper than other ones out there...
4,So far so good,Purchased this item I'd say almost 3 months ago and it has been working properly . Happy with this product and I could definitely recommend it.
5,Teriffic Little Opener,"Used these to replace the two gate openers for our condo. Those were the size of a pack of cigarettes and, frankly, old and tired out. These are great little units. I particularly like the button, a distinctive feel when activated which the old ones didn't have so yopu squeezed them to death until you saw the gate begin to move. These also exceeded the range of the old ones and in a size that is so much more convenient. But that can be a double edge sword. Small in size means they can get lost easily if you are used to the old style. But these are small enough to place on your key chain. I just toss mine in the change holder in my dash. The other is on her car keys.They were perfect for our needs and the price was right. Delivery was quick too. Buy them again gladly."
1,Waste of Time,"I fully expected to see a decent documentary that showed how children of different faiths came together at camp and how they gained understanding of each other's views. This simply didn't deliver. As a matter of fact, there was very little about the different religions other than showing Muslims praying and the kitchen being made kosher. Counselors at the camp had absolutely nothing planned. There was no agenda. The camp was like any other and there were no workshops to help the kids gain an understanding of each other. The mix of religions was hardly explored beyond the trivial. Absolutely nothing was learned from watching this documentary.For a far more compelling movie that features children exploring the differences between their cultures and religions, I highly recommend a documentary called ""Promises"". It is superior to ""Trust Me"" in every way imaginable. ""Promises"" should be required viewing for everyone everywhere. You can find it here:Promises"
1,No Subtitles,"i bought both the 1st and 2nd volumes, and my rating is more about the 2nd one. unlike the 1st, this one didn't show the french words on the screen that you're supposed to learn and repeat. the recording is ok, but not totally clear, so it would have been a lot more helpful to actually read what the dvd was talking about. there's no companion book that comes with it.in the menu, there's a glossary of terms, but it's such a pain to flip from the lesson to the menu to the glossary, back to the menu, and finally back to the lesson. i would try a different dvd if i were you."
2,OK but not good enough,I found this dvd set to be just ok.The animation effects are outdated and boring.
4,Nice Refreshing CD,"I found this CD in a local Goodwill store for $1.00! It's nice, except mastering quality (low volume and sometimes lacking low and high frequencies) is less than great!!! It's CBS Special Products, not Sony bull poop! :)"
2,Just Give Me The Notes!,"That's right, the author of this book either thinks that his readers are so stupid that they will not understand the blatant points and arguments his one-dimensional characters debate that he puts notes in the margins. As well, the prose style is so mundane that the notes are actually more exciting. He highlights the key arguments of PAS (Physician Assisted Suicide) but closes with the strongest arguments against and the strongest arguments for, stacking the deck against PAS. A biased book from a publisher that is biased (the publisher is a Christian publisher, a traditional Christian publisher, thus opposed to PAS)."
5,The Singletons,"The sophomore effort from the Lansing Michigan based singletons is a major improvement from their debut release. The group was able to do more writing with project which shows considerable growth! Give Him the Praise featuring Kirk Franklin is one of the hottest tracks on the CD while Your Worthy To Be Praised showcases what this family is known for which is praising and worshipping the God of their salvation. Their newly released single The Power Of Love can also be purchased on Amazon under the name ""The Singletons Family"""

3,Wrong title for item,"The Rovner 2RS is NOT a Bb Clarinet ligature. To order the correct Rovner Dark ligature for your Bb Clarinet, you should order the 1R model. The 2RS is appropriate for Eb Alto Clarinet."
3,"Good read, but doesn't ask why.","A good book, with an excellent examination of how the media has been pro Republican since well before Bush Jr came to office. However, anyone who is really interested in the news knows this already, knows how long it took for the MSM to ""notice"" the Downing St memo, for instance.What is lacking here is not *how* the MSM has been (and is) pro Republican, but rather *why*. There is no attempt to address that issue, and frankly, that would have made the entire book far more interesting and important.Anyway, this book just confirms to me that you won't get the full news if you rely on the American MSM. If you're interested in the truth, you have to also consult foreign media, like the BBC or better, the Independent. And then read blogs which take the time to do some real digging whether statements from politicians are true or not."
1,What a worthless waste of paper.,"Worthless, worthless, and more worthless. Lapdog for Bush? LOL. Sure he wasn't looking into the future and describing lapdogs of the lame stream media for Obama?"
3,"Powerful book, but riddled with editing errors","Starting with the very first sentence of the introduction, this book has shocking editing errors every few pages.It's riddled with extra words, missing words, and haphazard capitalization and punctuation. And the author got ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper's name wrong.Looks like it was a real rush job. Detracts from a book that's powerful and necessary."
1,"Boehlert's ""proof"" comes only by way of noting omissions","I flipped to the index of the book and looked for the name Richard Armitage. Did I find him? Of course not! Nevermind that he has been found to be the true leaker. I guess it doesn't matter because Boehlert, like the media, is only obsessed with getting at Karl Rove and simply because the media tried and couldn't make the link substantially, they make themselves and now Boehlert look like fools."
1,Lazy and not that great a read.,It's a lazy book. Almost as lazy as Ari Fleischer's horrible book. There is no art or scholarship in it. Yes the MSM has flaws but so do all institutions in mankind. The key is to look at the press intelligently and by pressing your thesis against the people you report on. This is an opinion-hunting exercise. I have an opinion now I'm going to find my facts. It sells books but with so many press critics on the bloggs saying the exact same thing it seems to me that the point of a book that is long lasting is to do something more than one long post on some blog. There needs to be a little scholarship and thought. The book may get better in the last third. I couldn't keep up the struggle. Life is too short.
5,very interesting no matter you political persuasion,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in how the media operates. It documents the pro-Bush nature of the press, to be sure, but more than that it illusrates how out of touch the press is with the problems facing average Americans. I would like to think that in the end this is something liberals and conservatives will agree on -- that the inside the beltway pundits do nothing but parrot ill-informed conventional wisdom.Here's hoping that the blogs -- both liberal and conservative -- can end the Gang of 500's reign of terror over the infoscape."
2,Who is this guy kidding!,"The press has savaged this President! And this authors proofs revealhis bias. Just another liberal who has never gotten over the 2000 election.This book show be read, but has to considered in the context of the actualevents.Authors like this, and most of the press have not been able to set aside thierown bias a report facts. Has this been a perfect administration; NO. But, thebush haters,(including this author) are not capable to doing anything butdistort the truth, or just flatout lie.I recommend the book, but check his ""facts""."
1,Not Safe,"I bought this item with a Coleman camping stove, which has turned out to be excellent (the stove). Regardless of whether you extend this stand fully or peg the legs in place IT IS NOT SAFE. The liklihood that your stove will fall through this stand is extremely high. I spent a long time experimenting with it before being forced to return it and buy a table. On the package another suggested use is as a stand for suspending a rubbish bag. If that is all that it can be used for, it's not worth the cash. A redesign is needed."
2,Shaky stand,"I think this product is priced too high based on it's quality (I paid $32, I think it's worth about $20). The stand is very shaky and it really needs to be staked down when used. Also if you use the stand to place a camp stove on it you need to secure the stove to the stand with velcro straps. The good news is that it is very light, compact and easy to use. The height is just right as well."
4,Very nice stand,"I've had this stand for a couple of years, and I'm very happy with it. It folds up compactly and is quick/easy to set up. I recommend staking the legs (there are holes in the feet for this). I also put a piece of plywood (that is slightly larger than my stove) on the stand under my stove - this allows some extra room to hold some of the things that you need when cooking."
1,No Customer Satisfaction from Coleman,"I just ordered this product, expecting it to be aluminum colored as the photograph indicates. Received item and it was not silver, but bronze (not at all applicable for what I ordered it for). I called Coleman and inquired. I was told once it had been opened, there was nothing they could do (how was I supposed to know it was bronze without taking it out of the box? Duh!). I said, ""So with the Coleman Company there is no such thing as customer satisfaction?"" The man replied, ""No."" Better make sure you order what you want (OR THINK YOU WANT!)!"
4,usefull,"Legs don't stay locked into place, requires some manipulation to keep it open all tha way. A liitle akward to do while setting up. Works well with weight on it."
4,Great idea,I really like this product as I always have to look for a safe sturdy place for the stove when camping. I usually camp at music festivals and you never know what the site will look like. This provides a great setup and is easy to use.
2,"Pretty rickety, not a good choice if you have a stove to pump up","This stand sets up quickly, is light but does not fit my Coleman two burner dual-fuel stove particularly well. Perhaps the new stoves are wider. I made a table top out of some scrap 1/4"" plywood I had to span the top. That provided a surface to place the stove on, but the real issue is that the stand wobbles a great deal. When pumping up the stove the stand was all over the place. I'll be looking for a better solution longer term."
1,unsafe,"I too found this product very unsafe. Just the slightest bump or nudge, like attaching the propane bottle and the stove was falling through the middle. Not the best thing to have happen when you're trying to cook. I guess I could glue on some velcro strips, like one of the other writers, but I shouldn't have to.Instead, I did convert it into a trash bag holder. I got it on a year end close out so the sting of an expensive trash holder isn't too bad."
1,Always falls over,The moment any gust of wind would hit this it would start to topple. I tried using it as a stand for the burners but it was way to low. I kept it and tried using it as a garbage bag holder but it always fell. Yuck.
4,MiniKeyboard,This Super Mini Kb Size Only 4X9 USB 77 Keys is just what I was looking for and use it every day on my Advantage X7510. Roger
2,Transition book...,"Oy. This is the transition book that transition from the neat story of book 1 into the longer arc that would take us through book 4. The pace in this book was intoreablly slow. Now, I think the only payoff for reading this book is that so you could continue to read book 3 (and maybe 4, I'm not there yet). But, unless you're committed to finishing the series, I wouldn't bother with book 2. Just let your mind wander in the world created in book 1."
2,Just awful.,"I got 30 pages into this book and I just couldn't keep reading it. What's the point? She's going to continue to be a tough, angry woman who is going to find new ways to be a better vampire and to save the guys that she loves despite the fact that one of them is evil..... This is such Cliche' crap!!!There are authors writing good, innovative Urban Fantasy. Armintrout just isn't one of them."
1,Incredibly Boring,"The first book in this series was okay, interesting enough to make me want to read the second. I wish I hadn't wasted my time. I could barely finish, and the only way I could finish was skimming the incredibly boring parts (which is a vast portion of the book). Also, I don't like the way the book skips from first person perspective to third constantly. Either have all characters in third, or lets just see the story from Carrie's first person POV. Slipping back and forth to make your story easier to write is a cop-out. It made the writing come across amaturish. And the story was just plain boring, did I mention that? I'm not interested at all in finishing this series."
1,Waste of Money!!!,"We unfortunately paid $100 a piece for each of the two floats we purchased from Brookstone. What a HUGE waste of money! The assembly instructions are horrible and it took at least an hour to get them together. When we pushed the motor button on the fist float, you could hear the motor, but the fan did not turn, therefore; the boat didn't move. The other float seemed to work okay until we put it in the pool to try it out. My 30 lb. daughter tried it first and it barely moved. The pool jets moved it more than the actual motor. The next morning the float was completely deflated and the leak was in the seam so it couldn't be repaired. The kids are so disappointed and I am sick that I wasted $200 on these worthless floats! After seeing one review that someone actually had floats that moved in the water, I am hoping my two defective floats were a fluke, but I wouldn't recommend taking the chance if they are priced at $100!"
5,Go Boots Go,"This album is right up there with his Yakety Sax album. Excellent material. Of special note are The Shadow Of Your Smile,a totally unique verion os Moon River and a tear-jerker version of Unchained Melody. Also a couple of Beatle songs through in. Considering when this album was recorded, the quality is extremely good."
5,This is quintessential Boots!,The LP version of this album inspired me to take up playing the saxophone as a young child. Boots is at his very best playing these 60's hits. I dare to say that my autographed copy of this CD is my most cherished posession. Enjoy!
1,Don't spend this much money!,"This is way too much to spend on this night light as it is found at Dollar Tree for $1.00. I bought it at Dollar Tree, in the EXACT same packaging even. It is a simple plastic night light and my daughter broke it just removing it from the wall."
2,Not What I Expected.,The mouthwash just isn't as good as the throat spray. I was so sorry to hear they quit making it.
3,seems to work but at what price?,"I think this stuff actually helps, at least I don't get prodded throughout the night anymore to stop snoring. However, an ever escalating price to now almost $40 for 10 ounces??????? That just isn't doable. There is an obvious demand for this product, why isn't it in the store, why is the price doubled in 4 months? I'll just do without until this gets rational.MAYBE NOT. I just bought this elsewhere at $11.15, this must be a 3 pack that is mislabeled.. There is a separate 3 packon the Amazon site but it shows as not being in stock. Amazon needs to sort this out."
5,breathe right,"I like the product, I think it's to high. I thought I was getting 2 bottles and I only got 1the list price was $13.00 and I paid $22.00 it did'nt make since. I will never order again and PLEASE do not email me until you lower the price.Rose"
3,It used to work....,"My husband used to be an occasional snorer and I randomly found this throat rinse at the grocery story one day. It worked like a charm, a miracle actually. Because he only used it occasionally (night he drank any alcohol, stuffy nose, etc) it lasted for a long time. By the time he went through the whole bottle I could no longer find it on the shelves. I WENT EVERYWHERE looking for it. I found it online and was so happy but his occasional snoring is now nightly snoring and this just didnt work this time around. I was so disappointed. I still gave it 3 stars because I believe it does work for occasional snoring...and he used the dissolving strips too and those worked. But his snoring is at the point where we are getting him a snore guard to wear and this stuff just cant handle that type of snoring, lol. Overall a good product if you are a light sleeper and your partner snores sometimes."
5,Restfull sleep,I have used this product in the past with very satisfactory results. I could not find it in my local drug stores and decided to try an on-line purchase and Amazon.com came trough for me. My wife and I were planning a trip and she really appreciated the use of the Snore relief when i useed it before going to bed.
3,May work for some,If you have a minor snoring problem this may work. It is a temporary fix and I think it doesn't last throughout the night.
1,DOES NOT HELP,FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS AND USED THE PRODUCT SEVERAL TIMES BUT IT DID NOT HELP. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
5,Clutch slave cylinder,"This part saved the day! I purchased an engine kit with a damaged sprocket cover, bought a new one but couldn't find a slave cylinder anywhere at a sane price until this one."
3,not quite as pristine as stated,"I requested the book ""like new"" to pay up to my max price---the book I got had a worn jacket cover with frayed ends....I have kept it because of it's rarity---but it was not exactly the condition I asked for."
3,teenie beanie,Got this for my son. His is disabled and even though he is 2 1/2 he can only lay down and play and can't sit up. we have been buying him the teenie beanies because they are more his size. However this particular bear was not well liked. Our son won't play with it and since it has a hat its a little crinkly our son won't let us put it next to him. Cute bear from my side. But i don't collect.
4,This product does what it promises and adds ...,"This product does what it promises and adds GREAT body. It has good holding power, even in our Texas humidity, and kept my hair smooth and frizz free all day. The shine was just an added bonus! I'll use this product and have recommended it to my daughters and friends."
3,I really liked the pump on the bottle. ...,"I really liked the pump on the bottle. It made it very easy to dispense the gel. And the smell was great. It was lacking in the hold department for me, as I like my gel to be a bit stiffer and hold a bit better. I'd buy this gel if there was a stronger hold."
3,This product seemed like your average hair gel. ...,"This product seemed like your average hair gel. It left my hair feeling a little sticky and I'm uncertain that the heat activated conditioning makes any difference. It did have a very nice stand-up pump package that made it easy to use. It's probably worth the price, but don't expect anything special."
4,I thought this product was great. It had ...,"I thought this product was great. It had a nice consistency -- it was not too thick. When I finished blow-drying my hair, it left it very soft. It didn't leave a crunchy feeling like some gels do. I like this product!!"
4,This product was used by my teenage daughter ...,"This product was used by my teenage daughter (14-years-old) who uses hairdryers, curling irons, etc. -- possibly doing serious damage to her hair. We've tried and liked the heat-activated hairspray (she uses tons of that too!) and it gave good results. This product also gives good results and she loves the shine and control it provides!"
2,Could not make it work on Vista,Very good idea but could not make it work on Vista after a few hours and gave up for now.
1,Why?,Why in the world would I spend $49.79 per movie when I can buy them separately for less than half that? Ever notice how anything Trek is more expensive? Been a Trekkie all my life and have never seen a good deal yet.
4,Great collection,"This is the ultimate Star Trek movie collection. My only observation is that in three DVDs the quality of the video is not as good as in the rest of the DVDs. Still, a must have for Star Trek fans."
2,Paramount really blew this off badly.,"Come on! They go an release these before they get to Star Trek 6 collectors or directors edition! That is just plane stupid. I will wait and buy them seperate, like I have been. Besides I own them all except for Star Trek 6."
4,Good Movies,The collection is good as far as the quality of the movies are concerned. The lack of special features is really the only drawback on this set.
2,Where's the blu-ray?,C'mon Paramount. There's enough VHS's & DVD's out there to sink a starship..what we ALL (real Trekker's) want is a re-mastered set of blu rays of all the movies in acceptable cases!
1,sucks,"i pd. over $130. for Star Trec motion pictures Dvd collection little did i know there was 3 DISK missing!! The Butt head did slip a list of missing dvds in the package the missing dvds were Generations,1st.Contact, Nemesis, what good is it . you would think the person would say something befor they take your money . So look out for this person, it a rip-off ."
5,Star Trek Movie Set,"Excellent....This box set of Star Trek Movies from Captain Kirk to Captain Picard is spectacular. The money is worth it. The DVD'S quality, sound, graphics, etc... are top-notch. Do I need to say more."
3,Good But Not Good Enough,"Look, they go to release all ten movies and they don't even bother to go and beef up the other five. That's reason why it gets 3 stars. I believe that Paramount could have done better with this release and well being the trekkie that I am it won't be bought until its fixed. But all in all hey at least they made an effort."
5,A gift for all Star Trek fans,A quality addition to my DVD collection of movies. I own the VHS version for many years and I now have a renewed interest in the movies after viewing its digitized quality. A great collection at a great value. I am able to get this collection at a great price whereas I would have paid more elsewhere.Thanks Amazon!
4,Star Trek Movies,"Being able to watch all of the Star Trek movies has been wonderful. The DVDs play well, no rewinding, I can rewatch my favorite scenes, catch commentary, and enjoy my trip to the future."
5,Great Deal,"Needless to say, the movies are great and Amazon is great to do business with. The only complaint I have is with the packaging. The DVD cases are nearly as thick as a VHS case so there is no significant space savings here. Not that would be the primary reason for buying this set, just an observation. If you like Star Trek and want a complete set of the Star Trek movies, you can't go wrong with this one."
1,Ugh,"Why is it so hard for Paramount to release a box set containing only all of the Special Editions they have ready so far? Every Star Trek box set is like this -- several movies with Special Editions and several more movies that you'll end up having to repurchase seperately because they are not the Special Editions.If you're looking to buy something for the Trekkie in your life, I strongly suggest looking up the Special Editions individually and buying them like that and avoid buying the movies that are not out in Special Edition yet -- save those for future gifts when they get released. Whatever extra you end up spending by doing it like this will ultimately be saved by not having to buy the regular edition now and then the Special Edition later.Perhaps the casual Trek fan will enjoy this box set but even for the casual viewer, I don't see why you'd want the regular edition of some of these movies now when you can wait a few months and get a much better edition later."
5,Love these movies,Finally spent the money to buy a full set because we had a pieced together sort of pirated set from my brother. Now all the DVD's work and my daughter has turned into a Trekky! Thank you for the great price!
5,EL STAR TREK DEFINITIVO,"NO IDIOMA ESPAÑOLEste set de las 10 primeras peliculas de STAR TREK es simplemente FABULOSO, y absolutamente INDISPENSABLE para los fans de tanto la TOS & TNG.Todas son ediciones especiales, con interesantisimos special features.En alta calidad de grabacion. Sin embargo, para los hispano hablantes, se les avisa que las peliculas NO TIENEN IDIOMA EN ESPAÑOL, y los subtitulos en ingles estan en todas las peliculas, y que solo hay SUBTITULOS EN ESPAÑOL en las ultimas tres de la TNG (First Contact, Insurection, & Nemesis). Ya saben entonces, pero si no les molesta este detalle no espeficicado en la pagina del producto, entonces, no lo duden y compren esta coleccion que es simplemente insuperable!!!!"
4,Be Grateful for What You Can Get!,"Look, the more recent movies come with a decent amount of material. Stop moaning over the undiscovered country. If you are a trekkie and it really matters to you, you know that ST VI was not that great. And if it really matters that much, throw away 6 or give it as a gift and buy the new version when it comes. This is offered to give buyers a chance to have all 10 movies in a uniform package, and all in one view. Get it for 13.99 when Amazon releases it (it's in the same style), and get a life outside of TV. Buy it from a zShop for 140.00 and save the 30 bucks. Then you can buy The Undiscovered Country for 14 and get the super saver shipping. You will have saved a big 16 bucks. Hey, thats enough to get you a ""PENNY PINCHING, UNGRATEFUL TO THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT IT TO YOU AT ALL GEEK"" T-Shirt. Big props to PARAMOUNT AND AMAZON for bringing these great sets."
5,$250?,Wow! Not sure what happened but I'm glad I bought this set when I did. I bought mine for $72 directly from Amazon.com. Now it appears that people are selling it here for $250.It's an excellent set for even non-trekkie's like myself. I grew up with these movies and with reruns of the TV show. Captain Kirk and James Bond (Roger Moore) were two of my earliest hero's in my pre-teen years.
2,Uh-oh...,"Words cannot even express my disapointment with this album. These guys are one of the best metal bands ever, and easily the best since Pantera stumbled out of a mysterious bar in Texas. Alexi Laiho and Janne Warmen are virtuosos at their respective instruments. Here is my hypothosis at what went wrong with this album... Alexander K. left the band, and I think that without him the styles of this band changed dramatically after the addition of Roope Latvala. Not in a good way either. This is simplified, un-melodic, and not very good sounding. If you a hardcore COB fan like I am, then you are extemely disapointed. Their best work ever was on Follow the Reaper, with Hatebreeder at a close second. I am an American, and even I know when to use the term ""American Sounding"". This is it. Sellout album for this band, and they will never ever be the same. You guys have left true fans in the to Kiss the Shadows alone. :("
2,What Happened?,"I have liked Children Of Bodom for a very long time... Follow The Reaper is one of my favorite albums. This cd... is ummm, BORING. Most of the songs sound the same, and they are not very good. I don't understand why they would release a cd like this... The band has so much talent, but it definatly doesen't show here.My advice is to avoid this, and pick up some of thier other cds."
4,Corelle Bowls,"Just bought two in case I wasn't satisfied. Now, I use them for almost everything. At least everything they can be used for in the desert."
5,Excellent quality.,Great product. It has exceeded my expectations. Speaker phone on the base and headsets allow you to listen to messages anywhere in your house.P.S. It doesn't interfere with your wireless router since it is 5.8GHZ.Buy one while you can.
4,Good product,Pros:- Great speaker.- User friendly navigation through options.- Smart design.- Easy data transfer from Receiver 1 to Receiver 2.Cons:- No electricity no calls as it comes with adapter only without battery chamber as a back up alternative.- Quality of voice still needs enhancement even with voice enhancer. Using speaker is much better than normal conversation.
4,Panasonic 5.8 GIG Phone,"PRO: Very nice phone... good quality, good Human factors, like being able to dial from base. Good battery life.CON: Base lacks display - can't see caller ID if handset not near by. Can't activate ""intercom"" (aka ""Find handset"") from base. Wallmount looks like an afterthought."
4,Panasonic Phone,The only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is the 3 hours bettery time other than that every one already knows that PANASONIC is the king in cordless phones the keys are very soft which is always very important in cordless phones the slim and sleek look is nice overall i love this set
4,"Great product,","I wanted a cordless with speaker on the base, which it has;great. I wish they made one wall unit, and the other a cordless. I had to hang one phone on the wall and it looks weird.Otherwise, very good features, and good quality phone."
4,NICE PHONE,Panasonic KX-TG6072B 5.8 GHz Expandable Digital Cordless Answering System with 2 HandsetsThis is a very nice phone. I find it easy to operate. The battery life could be a little bit longer. The only other minor problem I find is that the second phone volume is a little bit lower than the primary phone.The bad thing about this phone is if you need to mount it on a wall. The wall bracket is horrible. I could not mount mine at all. Panasonic should really do something about this. My old Panasonic was so easy to mount. They should use the old type of mounting bracket.
4,Good value,Less expensive here than at the drugstore or vitamin stores. Higher concentration of product than what seems to be available at the drug stores and vitamin stores.
5,American Hero,"Living in San Clemente, CA, I remember the local reports of Shane's death. He lived in SC when he deployed to Iraq. When I learned he was a Citadel grad (I'm from VMI) during one of Rinker's radio interviews, I had to buy this book and did by the end of that day. That said, I was very leery of how a New England columnist would present a topic as dividing as the Iraq War has been.I was not disappointed. Rinker left the divisive politics aside and focused on the man, family and Corps behind the hero. He provided and incredible story of a true American hero. No doubt, Shane is a hero.This work certainly could have been be written about many more of the countless heroes in this day. Rinker provides a first hand insight how the families of our heroes deal with their greatest loss. This is a must read."
5,Taliban,"The book arrived as described and timely. The book itself is very comprehensive, filled with a myriad of facts about the history of the Tailban and Afghanistan. The country has a very colorful past and the author does a very nice job of describing how the many factions make up the culture. I have a son in the US Marines, he is currently deployed to Camp Leatherneck in the kandahar area and this book has helped me understand what we and he are up against. I will be forwarding this to him after I complete.The people of Afghanistan deserve a chance at peace and as the book details they are a very hearty and resourseful peoples."
5,Well-written and a balanced account of the Afghanistan saga,"Rashid has commited a very thorough and extremely well-written book about the recent history of Afghanistan. It is balanced and gives the reader a clear picture of how Afghanistan has become so divided, torn apart and it explains in detail how and why virtually all of the state and civic institutions have ceased to exist. Allthough Rashid paints a bleak picture of Afghanistan's future, he is not without hope. A necessary prerequisite for a peaceful settlement is a strong international commitment to the future peace-process. No reader will probably walk away indifferently from the Afghan tragedy after having read Rashid's excellent book."
2,Interesting topic but boring write-up,"Bought this thinking it was high time I learnt more about Afghanistan. Although it is a very topical book, it is not written in a very lively or accessible way. The first third of the book was enough to paint the entire picture and I never got through the rest. It is not very anecdotal, and you get lost in the piles of historical stuff about tribes and tribes and skirmishes and skirmishes until it all swims together in a jumble and starts sounding alike.It is a very complete and earnest account and I have no doubt about the writer's authority on the subject, but it is more like a general survey of the history of the Taliban rather than a punchy book with a particular point."
3,Good outlook but lacking ultimate judgement that they must be dealt with,"yes a good book but it left out some of the most recent horrible actions by the taliban like the b-heading of teachers in the country. Of course the good thing is that this research is well founded and the documentation of the rise of the Taliban and their scope not just in Afghanistan, but the entire world is very good. So far I would have to say this is one of the better books on these ding bat goof ball chickens who hide behind babies and still think it is all in the name of Ah La. Barbaric ruling is brought to a whole new light and it makes me feel great I live where I do, can you imagine having your eyes gouged out because you pick what shows you watch for television?"
1,hard to read,"I found this book very hard to read, partly because of the writing and partly because of the book's design. The writing wasn't organized enough to get a clear, linear sense of how all the conflict developed in the first place. (I do realize, though, that the Middle East has such a chaotic history that trying to organize it all and clearly trace different developments is a huge undertaking.) The visual design of the pages also didn't lend itself to easy reading because the inside margins (i.e., the ones near the spine) were so small that I had to hold the book way, way open to read the words near the spine. Plus, there was too little white space between the lines of text. I know, I must sound like a picky visual person who isn't a serious reader; the thing is, I actually read a lot, and most of the books I read are current affairs books. This book is just so difficult to get through that despite its sound factual content, it does not relate the history in an easily absorbed format."
4,a note to Mr. Rashid...,"Hi,I liked the book, I think it is very informative. But I have to correct Mr.Rashid for a mistake he did in the book. He was mentioning Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline in the book in several places and in the conclusion part he was saying that ""The start-up for construction scheduled for the year 2000 has been progressively delayed to 2003 and most recently to 2005"". This is not true. The start-up for construction is scheduled for June, 2002. It was planned to finish in 24 months. But there is a possibility that it might be finished in 18 months. All the engineering and environmental tasks were completed. Construction firms were chosen. There is no delay or postponement in the plan so far."
5,Nice neighborhood!,"""Taliban"" by Ahmed Rashid is a most poignant illustration of the current state of Afghanistan and its neighbors. It details the interconnection, or lack thereof, between the foreign policies of different US Administrations, their connection to American corporate interests, and their seeming disconnection to regional and internal affairs in Afghanistan. To Mr. Rashid's credit, the book also deals with the various local players in ""The New Great Game"" in a detail no Western author could have accessed. Due to the large number of factions looking for a piece of the Afghani pie, and the thoroughness of Mr. Rashid's investigation, this book has more twists than a Robert Ludlum novel. I urge anyone looking for a primer in Central Asian politics to read this book."
4,To know the real Taliban.,"Best description of the Taliban. Who they are? Who are involved in the creation of them? What is the role of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran? Their sick and twisted minds in the big plan and picture. If want to know what is happening in Afghanistan now, read this book first and then you understand what is realy happening out there these days."
5,The best book I have ever seen on the Taliban,This is the best book I have ever seen on the Taliban and their connection with Pakistan and CIA. This book is enough to know who are Taliban and why they commit such heinous crimes against Afghan people and especially Afghan women. You can find a lot of info about the history of this black and reactionary movement. You can also find how Taliban encourage Afghans to get involved in the production of heroin....Thanks
4,Absolute distraction,"Whilst researching for a university assignment I came across this brilliant piece of distraction.For the record, I chose to cop the late penalty for the assignment."
2,Not too good,"This book just talk of the taliban from a western point of view, which is already well-known. It does not talk of how the takiban appeals to the Afghan psyche and how the Taliban were welcomed in several towns they arrived in. It only talks of harsh Sharia', which Afghans have lived under for hundreds of years. It also does talk of the Mazar-e-Sharif massacre, which i feel didnt get enough attention."
5,"Great book, but sometimes tough to understand","I think Rashid has done a great work writing this book (let's be real, it's the FIRTS book wrotten about the Taliban movement). It is very well documented. Although sometimes is tough to understand certain ideas and it can be difficult to follow so many names and facts when someone is not so familiarized with the terminology."
5,Great Basic Understanding of Political and Ethnic Situation,"A great BASIC education of the politics and ethnic situation in Afghanistan in the year 2000. It would have saved America many lives and much money if our US president after 9/11 had paid attention to facts and the situation that he was getting us into. 10 years later it raises the difficult, if not impossible, question of: what now? But at least now common sense appears to prevail in the White House. Ahmed Rashid makes an unbiased and cogent evaluation, but no solutions yet!"
4,Informative Read but Dry,I found this book to be extremely informative but a bit dry. The info on the oil connections was most interesting to me.
4,Worth Reading,I enjoyed this book and would read it again. Rashid has certainly done his homework.The beginning was a little difficult - Rashid jumped around so much chronologically when mapping out Afgan history up to the point of the rise of the Taliban that I had a hard time keeping the time-line straight. Once he got into the 1990's the writing became much better... and by the end of the book things came together pretty well. Overall a very enjoyable read that I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Disinfo,"Demonizes the Taliban without mentioning any wrong doings by western intelligence agencies who are orchestrating everything in Afghanistan anyways. CIA trained the Taliban ( Mujaheddin )and they turned around and banned opium growing and rejected the oil pipeline proposal, so we had to go in and ""Make Afghanistan Safe for Democracy"". Now there are record Opium harvests and we are going to invade anyways so that we can flank Iran. This book,like the official 911 joke book focuses too much on winning the reader over with emotionalism."
4,A Great Overview of the Taliban's Activities and Operations,"This book reveals what this organization is all about --- from activities planning to membership hierarchy. The descriptions throughout the book detail what we have seen in news reports concerning the Taliban. However, while the media has failed to disclose the enormity of the horrendous nature of the Taliban, the author tells all. From senseless executions to ridiculous business demands, it's all here. The book is a somewhat difficult read, due to the many references to Middle Eastern names and terms, etc., but the information provided is well worth it."
5,a master piece,"Knew some about Afghanistan, but learnt a lot about the behind the scene stuff, A Rashid is not only well informed and a good analyst, he also writes really wellA must for anyone who wants to know more than what newspapers say, or anyone who is involved with Afghanistan.US foreign policy at its worst, as usual"
4,Information - here it is.,"A lot of information, most of it very esoteric to the West. Slanted with Islamic-centric world view that celebrates the Clinton traitors and the impotent UN bureacratics, but full of interesting history and an excellent primer on the Taliban and Afghan history."
4,Holds up well,"Considering that the book was written prior to September 11th attacks (and the polices that resulted) this book holds up fairly well. Above all, while this book near the end lays out a role for the U.S. diplomatically--it seems to lay out a framework for why any strategy involving the miltary (including the U.S) won't work.Rashid does a good job of describing the violent history of Afghanistan and Central Asia, as well as how the Taliban came to power. This book is especially relevant given the current U.S dilemma with Afghanistan. Afghanistan was in civil war that even the Taliban, as violent as they could be, could not completely put out. The U.S. occupation more or less reopened this powder keg.Reading this book, it's hard not to get a sense of blowback on the part of the U.S: i.e. supporting the mujaheeden and looking the other way on the drugs that supported the mujaheeden have created a nightmare now."
4,Interesting,Read just before a deployment to Afghanistan. Helped me learn th e ins and outs of th area as a whole. Gets a little dry I the middle when talking about specific Taliban policies. Especially the economics
2,Just one question,"While respecting the author's effort and in-depth research, I found the excuses in the opening chapters in favor of the Taliban unpalatable.I just have quesstion to ask Mr. Fergusson: how would he like his daughters or his grand-daughters to live in a country run by the Taliban?Comparing the Taliban era with the worse pre-taliban period is meaningless. Both should be rid of, if possible."
5,One of the best !,"Ahmad Rashid, a Pakistani journal understands logistics of area and sentiments of its population.He does excellent job of explaining the reasons for past,present and future problems facedby Afghanis.This book is by far and large the best source of information on Afghanistan and Taliban.I wished American Media had read this book before presenting their dismal coverage of Afghanistan post Sept 11 events."
2,"Not a ""new"" book","This product was advertised as ""new,"" but the book that came to me appears to be used. Two pages are dog-eared, several pages and the back cover have smudges of a brown substance, and the corners are worn."
4,Who are the Taliban,"This was a very useful book for me after 9-11. I had not idea who the Taliban were and why they were not cooperating like almost every government in the world with the U.S. requests.This information in the book helped me to understand who they were, how they came to power and the practices they followed. I now understood what I heard on the news about the Afgan ""Tribal Leaders"". I recognized the names and was able to read on their history. This was a very informative book and I learned an awful lot from it.Also covered in this book are the ties between oil companies and their hopes of using the countrie for pipelines. How Iran and Iraq wanted rights to cross the country. It was eye opening to see some of the things that are going on.Buy it - learn from it."
5,65-inch Ribbon Pedestal Stand,This is a strong stand and easy to put together. I am very pleased with my purchase and I know you will be too.
5,Definitive book for gingerbread builders,"Teresa Layman has two books on gingerbread, both over 20 years old and hard to find. Very clear writing, recipes and templates make this book a great reference for gingerbread architects. Many a competition gingerbread winner has based their entry on Teresa Layman's patterns."
5,Gingerbread :Things to Make and Bake Book,I had the chance to borrow this book before I purchsed it for myself and even though its out-dated it was a fantastic buy! I organize a youth gingerbread-building party every Christmas season and the kids absolutly LOVE the houses we've done in this book. It arrived on-time and without issue! I truely think is book is totally worth the buy!
2,Cluttered Photography/Few Photos,"Photographs of ""creations"" cluttered by miscellaneous ""stuff"" and there are very few good, professional quality samples to be inspired by.I would definitely pass on recommending this particular book."
5,loved 'em live and now i love 'em in my car!,"i've seen bodie play live several times live, (in long beach and l.a.) and i've always thought they were really great. i was stoked to find that they've gotten their CD finished and when i bought it, i wasnt disappointed! i've got it spinning in my car and i'm getting totally hooked especially on songs like Carne Desire and Save Me from You and Dont Feel Good...keep up the great work, bodie, and i'm so excited that now people all over the country who couldnt normally get to a bodie show, can enjoy your music now, too!"
2,Another half assed gay movie,"There is one major plot hole in this movie. One that leaves the whole movie completely unresolved. In the film, the main character's boyfriend suddenly disappears because someone lied and told him that his boyfriend is HIV positive. The main character has no enemies so who did it? We never find out. And the main character never sees his boyfriend ever again. Instead, he decides he will become a slut and have sex with random people. Wow. In the end, he finds love with a new guy who we never get to know.The movie revolves around a musical that sort of mocks Christians. That's not a way to get people to look at you with respect. The musical also depicts gay men as wing-wearing, skipping-prancing sissies. The one positive thing I can say about it is that some of them could actually sing pretty well.Over all, this is another gay movie with a weak script and only furthers stereotypes."
5,Great Movie,"If you don't mind your religion being made fun of, you will really enjoy this movie. This is a gay romance story about actors in a ""Big Gay Musical"" called ""Adam and Steve"". Great music, great cast, great story..."
5,Not too bad relative to the rest of the Gay canon,"I am glad I bought this movie. It's actually funny, romantic, and campy at times (but mostly within the ""Gay Musical"" parts). The acting is actually not that bad and the quality of production is quite nice. I was actually surprised, because the cover jacket is kind of dumb.I was even glad that the actually tell the story of these two guys as they each go through their own issues with love and relationships and become good friends who don't fall for each other or are destined for each other.This one actually has a good ending where so many in the gay canon of movies, good or bad, do not and I am not the biggest fan of leaving a movie depressed for the wrong reasons."
5,Funny and very touching,"I have to say first that I was kind of skeptical about this film before I watch it. I was afraid that could be another waste of my time to watch an empty and meaningless gay comedy like ""Eating Out 3"" or ""Another Gay Movie 2"" but thankfully I was totally wrong.In fact it's just the opposite of that. A great comedy, filled with hilarious stage moments, but also a very human and touching movie about mankind (in all its diversity) A little unreal at the end but that's OK! I'm kind of sick of watching too many sad endings in gay themed films. We need a lot more positivity in the portrait of gay lifestyle. So... it's great to have a mushy but happy ending FOR A CHANGE! That way... later you could turn off your tv with a happy smile on your face for a change. Great script, good acting, good music, beautiful guys... what more can we ask?"
3,Was Quit Good NOT THE Best But Good,I enjoyed it. it was cute funny. the cast were cute. Only thing i didn't like was it seemed to short. Also it was a tad confusing. Other then that its a good type of movie when you have nuthin else to watch but you will still enjoying watching it. sooo yes was good but not fantastic =]
2,Don't waste your money,"... While the photography is stunning and the models likewise, this video is no more revealing than typical softcore stuff you see on cable TV. Basically well-photographed people pretending to have sex. ..."
2,Not erotic. Too many guys.,"Director Antonio Adamo clearly isn't interested in those wonderfully erotic girl/girl encounters that Penthouse is famous for, which is why I can say that I'm happy I only rented this DVD rather than purchasing it."
5,"Okay for a ""B"" Movie but excellent Customer Service","I received the Knightriders DVD here in COB Adder, Tallil, Iraq in a very resonable amount of time. It arrived in good condition and there was no problem with the shipment or the vendor. I would not have any problem recommending this vendor or buying from them again myself. Reviewed by Mark E. Grant, author of Blood of Scotland available at Amazon.com"
3,The troubadour's beginning,"This is where it all began. While the singing and the music was much improved later, we can glimpse the humor and the rhythmic melodies here that would form the foundation for Al Stewart's later works."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I was hoping for more from this album. Most of it is clearly low-grade ""me-too"" irritating 60's Brit-Pop. Perhaps the label consider AS another Davey Jones from the popular Monkees, but the songs just don't measaure up in the least to AS's later work. There are one or two standouts, perhaps, but the listener might be better served by buying a compilation of earlier work.Of course, if you are an absolute AS fan, then this CD will surely complete your collection.I had this on vinyl 30 years ago, but my recollection had been dim. I somehow thought, or remembered, that it was on the order of ""Past Present and Future"", but sadly I and my memory were mistaken. If you must get it, I would suggest purchasing a good used copy for less."
5,Great learning experience,"I loved this book. I would recommend this to anyone who has problems withaniexty, self doubt. This book has helped me, and my aniexty level dropped down 70%. I am facing my fears, as the book says I am watching from the bleachers not being in the game. Great learning book."
3,Not as good as Vernon Howard,"I agree with the other reviewers who point out that, while the ideas in Finley's book are good, they are derived from those of his teacher, Vernon Howard. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. Howard drew on many earlier writers himself. Unfortunately, this book is nowhere near as clear as Howard's writing, and, well, it's kind of longwinded. If you find Finley's book helpful - great! But if, like me, you were frustrated by a sense that there's something true in there and you can't quite get at it... go to the source and read Vernon Howard."
4,Inspiring and educatonal,Emotionally rewarding. this book was not only organized in an easy to read fashion but also well written even for beginners like myself.
2,Not one of the better books written on non dualist thought,"Guy Finley was a student of Vernon Howard who basically taught a non dualist view of the universe. Although many of the concepts in this book are accurate, Guy is just not that gifted of a writer I'm sorry to say. I would recommend the book ""Loving what Is"" by Byron Katie that covers the same areas but is written much clearer."
1,Didn't understand a word of this book,"I absolutely appreciate the importance of letting go, but I didn't understand a word of this book. At least I understood all the words and the sentences, but not what the author was really on about. So I couldn't finish the book or even get past the first two chapters.I see the book got a lot of positive reviews on this site so my lack of comprehension must have something, or everything, to do with me. Anyway, just wanted to state my opinion."
5,Great book!,This is an excellent book! I have read it before and it helped me a great deal. I purchased it again to share with a friend.
1,A big time waster with little to say,"Don't waste your time with this book. It is disjointed, mostly incoherent and unorganized. It is full of promising chapter and section headings but then once you read them you realize that the author has just used a lot of words to not say anything of real substance. You'd be better off reading a book of mythology because that is about all this book is. It wastes time with stupid, inane and mostly pointless stories and analogies. What little of value that there is in this book could have been compressed down to about 10% of the total. The basic gist of this book (in my opinion anyway) is to just accept whatever life sends you're way. Of course you'll be happy if you blindly accept whatever happens but isn't the real point to actually change your life to what you want and not just to meekly accept the cards that you're dealt?"
2,Disappointment.,"Well meaning but simplistic hot air and waffle. Don't waste your time. Cheers on the ""path""."
5,Exceptional! How to let go of negative thoughts that run us,"For three years now, this book has been my how-to guide to ridding myself of my negativity. Thank you Guy Finley. The screen saver of the same name equally shows up to guide my life. I wouldn't be without either the book or the screen saver."
4,The Premise is Assuring,"To be honest with you, I didn't really understand the parable in the beginning and the book really didn't stick through all of the cobwebs upstairs (maybe too much salt water), so I had to re-read it again. But I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it for reading, because I think that just the premise will be re-assuring to those in any barefooted search for truth or escape from fear or whatever it is that's tripping your lights man. He has a very crystal clear vision and that's why I am currently re-reading it. I suggest you read it a few times until it sinks in. Big Guy's got it going on man. also has a web-site and gathering in Oregon. BY-JOVEY, THIS MAN IS ON A POSITIVE MISSION."
1,HUH?,I must be a simpleton. I have a masters degree and I found this book to be so twisting on the mind. How many times does one have to read this book to understand what can be in my opinion expressed in a much simpler and easily digestible way. Best I go back for my PHD. The secret to my letting go is letting go of this book. Apparently others think so because you can buy it at used prices starting at 50 cents.
2,Guy is a clone of Vernon Howard.....not the real thing!,"Letting Go was ok, but lets face it sports fans, how can you let go when you are still reading mind monkey books that tell you to let go? Guy was a student of the late great Vernon Howard. Guy should just sit back and enjoy his green without trying to posterboy the wisdom of vernon."
1,not recommended,"I'm sure about two things: the author knows what he's talking about and he's far more clever than I am. No doubt he's on to something but I found the book completely unreadable. I started trying to understand Chapter 1, then speeded up and started skimming and finally just picked on odd pages that looked promising but it's very disappointing. Don't waste your time buying it. Any decent (simple and readable) book on Buddhism will teach you something very much more relevant."
5,Great,I enjoyed reading this. It was very insightful. I would recommends it to people that want to find out more about the journey of life and how to make a successful happy life!
2,Disappointing,"This book deals with a topic that is important to just about everyone - how to move on and not dwell on perceived hurts. The one good thing that I got from the book is that the ""hurt"" is not what happens to you, it is how you react to it. That is a big plus. Unfortunately the author pulls wild ideas out of thin air and presents them as incontrovertible facts and uses wild analogies and woolly arguments throughout the few chapters I managed to finish before giving up on the book. Not a book for an intelligent and critical reader."
5,"Clear, Authentic Teachings, Appreciated by the Millions Who Decided to leave their Past Behind","This Book has been a Miracle for myself and so many of my loved ones.It provides the One Answer that will always change your inner (spiritual) conditions for the better. You can always Let Go, and let silence show you a new life without it.In a world of Hype, Pop-Psychology, and Spiritual Sensationalism, It is a breath of fresh air.If you are tired of Spiritual Entertainment, Promises and Crowd-Pleasing Hypnosis - This book teaches you how not waste your life, and also how to Work. Spiritually. Productively.I hope you are one of the lucky ones, that is starting to suspect that the real ""secret"" is to not NEED any form of control, to be at peace with your life.Everything else that can come, will come, naturally.I wish you good fortune on your true path. Get started today."
3,Good but not quite there.,"I also use a scooter, a Pride Revo. First off I do like the mesh seat cover (rather than straps). BUT it's really tight to get on and if you have bad hands it would be a real challenge. I would have loved to give this 5 stars but though it has a medium sized compartment and can hold some items very well I would like it to be larger. I would like to fit more then two small bags of groceries in it. The mesh pockets are tight as well. My water bottle is hard to put in and take out (granted it's a larger bottle). But really all in all it gets most of the job done. I do recommend it."
5,True Blue or Blue ?,"True Blue was a great book . Blue is a new character and we got to meet him in the last book . Blue is a ''mellow kind of guy and all he cares 'bout is surfing and video games . Well since Blue lifes wit hid brother , Leaf , a social worker doesn't like the way his grades are and she wants to see him . if she doesn't see what she likes she ..... might take away Blue from Leaf ! So blue has to get his life together . Which is pretty funny how he does it in this book , but read it you'll enjoy it . the side story is lacey has a huge secret that only betherl knows . yup thats right BETHERL AND LACEY talk 'bout an exciting book !"
2,boring but bareable.,"i'm a really big fan of SVJH, but i really have to say this book was pretty boring. if it wasn't for the bethel and lacey situation, the book would have been dull."
2,A supposed classic,"I bought this for my granddaughter and read it, therefore never gave it to her. Harriet is a brat whose parents don't stand up to her and the moral of the story is sometimes you have to lie. Not something I want to encourage in my grandchildren."
4,Harriet the Spy,This book is a pretty good book. Although it would have been a lot better if I was in the fifth grade but since I'm not it seemed very little kiddish. The actual story was pretty interesting beside the fact that little kids these days don't worry about who did what and when. They care mostly about having fun and growing up with their friends.
5,And I thought I was the only one,"I thought this book was my own little treasure. I have never seen it on any 'must read' lists. I'm sure there are about 3 years of children growing up in Highland Michigan that never got to read this book because, I ALWAYS had it checked out. I remember that the book was huge (always sideways on the shelf) and how I identified with Harriet. I couldn't have told you the story until I started reading some of the other reviews. But it sticks in my mind along with Charlotte's Web, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Anne of Green Gables as favorites."
2,NOT a kid's book,"This is a book ostensibly written for kids, but it's really the kind of book that adults read and love and only THINK that kids like. I read it as a child and thought that the characters were uniformly unlikeable (except for Ole Golly, my hero) and the situations unpleasant. As an adult, I enjoyed it, but I'm ready now for more spicy foods. This is like a very hot Bloody Mary, and as a child I was more interested in pina coladas. Does that make sense?"
3,LOVE IT!!! but......,I LOVED reading Harriet the spy!!!! The prop. wuz im one of those people who get ideas from books.So I have 3 notebooksI started this year. I took the first one 2 skool and myteacher took it @ study hall. I HAD SORTA MEAN THINGS IN MY NOTEBOOK!!! and SHE READ THEM ALLL!!!!!!!!!!!! And wuz VERYmad @ me. I`m gonna start a notebook nxt year or summer :)))
2,Good points and bad.,"Harriet is not a nice little girl. She seems to have some serious problems, most of them probably having to do with the fact that her parents don't seem to know how to raise a child--they seem to either ignore her or smother her.However, the plot, although full of rather unpleasant events and attitudes, is realistic. People do behave that way, and talk that way, and to try to wrap your child up in a cocoon where they are insulated from everything negative and disagreeable is not a good idea. The child will, sooner or later, encounter people or events like this in real life, and having first done so in fiction s/he will be forearmed. I wouldn't advise feeding a child a literary diet only of this sort of story, but as a part of a balanced literary diet, it is certainly worthwhile."
1,"BORING, abandoned","WHen I opened this book it was so boring and downright 2-year-oldish, that I abandoned it and didn't read the rest. It seemed utterly stupid, and though very small children may like the idea, i practically fell asleep.....and it wasn't because of the thickness. I've read thicker. I hope Louise Fitzhugh has some better books out there.....I RECOMMEND:dragon riderthe secret gardenarthur and the invisiblesartemis fowl seriesmidnight blue"
5,Cool and cute,"This book is neat. It's an open look through the eyes of a child.At some point in the book, I thought it may be too mature for a child to understand. It asks the questions of how much effort do Harriet's parents put into understanding the child? Will a child reading this book transpose the behaviors of Harriet's parents as theirs?"
4,Fun reading for those who like spys,"Harriet the Spy is about a girl named Harriet, who likes to take notes on everyone and also likes to spy. One day, the kids in her class get a hold of the notebook that she writes in and they read all the notes in it. I really liked the beginning when Harriet is spying, but the book peters off."
5,Still Reaping Rewards!,"I don't remember how old I was when I first read Harriet the Spy, but I read it and read it and read it. Reading it now with my eight-year-old daughter, I am reminded of what a strong influence this book had on me. I tried to spy like Harriet, and got a stern talking to from my mother not to listen at phones. I ate tomato sandwiches, and occasionally still do! I started writing in notebooks from age 12 onwards. But most of all, I recognized a kindred spirit - a child who was not always kind, felt things deeply, and had plans for the future. I'm sure there are parents who will be put off by Harriet's self-absorbtion, but remember, she's 11! And this book is chock full of life lessons: actions have consequences being chief among them.Plus, you and your child will laugh together!"
5,This story never gets old!,"This was my favorite book as a child, and I have a copy ready for my son when he can read. He just turned five, and we love to listen to audio books in the car. We recently finished Harriet the Spy, and boy, has the story aged well! Some parts were beyond his comprehension, but he enjoyed all five discs. Harriet's experiences are great life lessons that are still relevant. This is great for boys and girls, as well as moms and dads."
4,The Sneaky Spy,"It is about a girl who is a sneaky spy. She has a notebook that she loves. She has written some mean things about her best friends. Will she ever become friends with them again? Find out in Harriet the spy. This would be a goood boook for people who like and mysteries. It is a very good book. If you have time read the book Harriet the spy. I know if you read it you will like it. It wasn't the best book I ever read, but it was the second best book I ever read in my life. Please read Harriet the spy."
4,Children's book at it's best,"Louise Fitzbaugh's book involves an 11 year old girl with a fiercely independent streak who doesn't realize how dependent on others she actually is. Her goal is to become a world famous spy and considers herself ""working"" when she wanders around the city spying on others and recording all of her observations in her notebook. What she discovers through her travels is how others can be hurt by her words and also how much she needs her friends and family despite her initial opinion that she needs no one but herself.Fitzbaugh's writing pulls the reader into the story and allows you to identify with exactly what the main character, Harriet, is experiencing and feeling. It is a perfect encapsulation of exactly how a girl that age is feeling and the range of emotions young girls deal with as they are trying desparately to join the adult world while retaining their childhood fun.This book will be enjoyed by readers of all ages."
1,Ugh!!! Tough read. Not fun for normal kids.,"This is a terrible book. When I was done my brain hurt. I totally get the lesson, but at the catholic school I attend Harriet's behavior would not be tolerated. She Is a spoiled brat with bad manners."
2,Disappointed,"I didn't enjoy this one as much as I thought I would. I listened to this with 2 of my daughters, and we were all a little disappointed. There are definitely some funny and amusing parts. But, I was bothered by the fact that Harriet really was very critical of others, and so self-centered. I thought by the end of the book she would change, but she really doesn't. . . not much anyway."
2,You all love it. I despise it.,"This makes me an outcast, perhaps. But I absolutely loathe Harriet the Spy. No, not the book. The character. Harriet. The first time I read this book I ripped it to pieces and had to pay the library. This book is honest and groundbreaking and all that, perhaps. But I cannot stand it. It makes me want to throw up, but that's too passive. I did like that girl who wanted to blow up the world. But if I ever encounter Harriet on the street, there's going to be trouble. I don't understand why and how we are supposed to like this character, much less how and why so many people do. But I think she is the basest sort of person, and deserving of far, far more punishment than she gets. I have now written two reviews based on the main characters; both characters write in journals things which they would never speak. I love Mary Lou Finney (from ""Absolutely Normal Chaos"" by Sharon Creech). I despise Harriet. And, wow, it's great to get this all off my chest."
1,worst book ever!!!,"Harriet the spy is a horrible book. I read the first half and exactly 0 interesting things happened. Her nurse is fired. She is in a play. She likes spying on people and writes everything down in a notebook. Harriet's voice is childish and sassy-sounding. There is no voice in it but Harriet's, which gave me a headache. There's nothing that would make a reader care the least bit, and I even began to hate Harriet. Life, life, life. All Harriet deals with is life, which we all know about. She handles everything like a preschooler,and lacks a satisfying character.This book is not worth the paper it is written on. I didn't like this book one bit!"
3,IT'S AN OK BOOK,"Harriet the spy has a secret notebook which she fills with udderly honest jottings about her parents, her classmates and her neighbors. But when Harriet's notebook is found by her friends their anger causes an unecspected problem!!!!"
2,don't wast time reading it,When I finished the first story I had trouble moving on! The only part I liked was when her friends read her journal.
3,Why Did Everyone Love this So Much?,"Admit it, you didn't like this book. When I read this, I was the perfect age, loved to read, blah blah blah. I tried to like it, but it was really very UNrealistic. The world that children live in is nothing like this one. Just because something is unusual doesn't make it honest."
4,I wish I had read this as a kid,"I enjoyed HARRIET THE SPY, but I wish I had read it as a kid. Then, I might have become a spy myself. At least, I might have been more faithful in journal-writing. But now, what I really want to know about Harriet the Spy, is: what is her recipe for tomato sandwiches? I have tried a few tomato sandwiches myself -- and I must confess, I was slightly disappointed. However, I am willing to give tomato sandwiches another go. After all, our garden is bursting with green tomatoes -- what will I do with them all when they ripen"
4,fun,this book is excitiinig and shows alot of fellings.some times I think this book was made for me. this is my first book I've read that Luis has wrote.thats what I think about this book and I hope I will find more of his books . He has a great taste of writing .
4,Harriet The Spy,"It is about a 9year old spy.She has a route of peoples houses to spy on.She has a notebook thats what she writes about people ,and her friends.Then her friends read it and team up.So there really really mad at her.They made a club and there going to do someing,to her and she wants to know.She also lives in aparments with her mom and dad.Thats what its about.The reason I like it is it had interesting details. one thing I didn't like was it was so long."
5,Pat Cadigan the Queen of Cyberpunk,"In this collection are some of the best cyberpunk stories around. It is good to see this book finally back in print. All will see why Pat Cadigan is a well respected writer of science fiction and in the sub genre cyberpunk. If you want to read good short stories with a bite, then Patterns is the book for you."
2,"Difficult, visually.","The first game we played on Gamecube was Spongebob, Battle for Bikini Bottom. We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over. Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar, we rented it. It's very hard to control the c-stick and it kept zooming in and out and wouldn't rotate the camera except for certain times. The charactors were very distant and even if we used the c-stick to zoom in, it still wasn't close enough. It's the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly! Another aspect we didn't like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor. Maybe we're spoiled because the c-stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions. It's surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite."
2,Not for young boys,This game is rated E for everyone when it really needs to be for Teens. The boys had fun but after playing it not just my son but My friends son were reported hitting females. I do not recommend this for young boys.
3,A Fun Game But......,"...the graphics are pretty imbarasing.The object of the game is to get snapshots and you get these snapshots by completing missions, levels, and Hero Times (a specific mission were you use one character). Some of the levels are fun, like the Far, Far, Away level(it has a Grand Theft Auto Theme).I give the graphics a 3/5 (I think they should have done a better job on the main characters), audio 4/5, gameplay 4.5/5, fun a 4.5/5, and an overall of 3/5."
4,Family Fun,"Our family loves playing this game together. I have a 6 and 4 year old and we all can play this game and be which ever charater we choose. The puzzels are easy for this age group and there are plenty of chances for our son to be challenged in the one player 'hero times'. Plus, if other kids come over that do not play these types of games at home - they can jump right in too. My kids still find it fun to go back to certain chapters and play through it again - its a family favorite."
2,Fun but too expensive for a kid game,"Bought the game last week and our 6 and 8 y.o. kids like it so far, it's fun but definitely not on par with Harry Potter or Finding Nemo. The movie is much much more fun than the game. It doesn't have what we call the 'stickiness' factor. You can play as Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and few other characters and it's better to play as a team than as a single player. The game, however, is far too short for the full price. Most GC games of equal or better quality are much cheaper. I feel I paid $10-$20 extra for the marketing and hype. For those who like Shrek, think about renting it (can be finsihed over a weekend) or wait few weeks until it gets discounted."
3,Fairly Decent...,"This game was ok, it served it's purpose. Me and my friend had fun trading off the controller and playing it together.It was, of course, not as good at the movie. The graphics weren't the best and I agree that it has no replay value.However, it was very cool to be able to play all the different characters from the movie and use all their different powers to solve puzzles.All in all, it's worth a rental."
3,It's okay.,"This game is pretty okay. I rented it at a video store, but I knew the second the first level started it wasn't very good. The camera angle and gameplay is repetitve. If you want a simple easy game, this is for you."
1,Go with a Japanese brand,"Even though Samsung licenses the technology from Japanese vendors, they suffer 1) poor quality control, and 2) terrible ergonomic design decisions, and 3) extremely bad customer support -- don't expect to find anyone if you need support such as warranty fulfillment. A much higher-quality JVC or Sharp doesn't cost much more, and gives you years of trusty service. The image quality on this model is pretty poor, prompting a Korean reviewer to call it worse than many 8mm camcorders. I can't comment on audio, but I'd be really really surprised if a Samsung can have better audio than a Panasonic, which Digital Video magazine gave a very positive review of.So go with the best and get a reliable Japanese brand."
4,A very funny show,"This is one of the funniest shows on Comedy Central. Drawn Together basically mocks every reality TV show from every channel at once. The laughs are non stop. A fast paced show, but has a lot of repeating gags. Why only 4 stars, because the show deserves 5 because it's so funny and unpredictable, but this DVD deserves 3 because the DVD release is butchered. The DVD starts with a lot of ads from Comedy Central. You can't skip right to the Menu either. That is enoying. The first DVD has 5 episodes, the second only 2. Why couldn't they space them out more, like 3 and 4 I don't know? The other reason this DVD is 3 stars, one of the unaired episodes is not shown here either. If you didn't air the episode, at least put it into the DVD. Only 7 out of 8 episodes in this DVD set. The season was very short as it is, but not to show one episode is cruel."
4,Hilarious,"A great show, but the first season isn't as good as the second and third. It truly is a shame it got canceled."
4,Missing episode still missing,"I enjoyed seeing these episodes again, but I was looking forward to seeing the episode that was too controversial to air. I guess it was too controversial to include on this box set. What a disappointment!"
5,All the seasons,If your gonna get this one you might as well buy all the rest of them too this cartoon is addicting and if you like vulgar stuff you will love this..
1,Groundbreaking my A$$,"Wow. I sat through about one episode becaus it came with the new Reno 911 DVD. I just sat and did not laugh at all. This show is not at all innovative or groundbreaking whatsoever. Adult cartoons were broken out by the Simpsons and South Park took it to be offensive and dark. This show is another show like Family Guy that is just trying to shcok the audience rather than be funny. Yes, having a reality show with cartoons was a clever idea, but in the episode I saw they call eachother Jews, retards, and there is a scene where they stare offscreen for about four minutes. Ground breaking my a$$.Groundbreaking comedy:Monty Python, South Park, Seinfeld, MST3K, Honeymooners, those are groundbreakingNot Groundbreaking Comedy:Drawn Together, Friends, Turn-on"
1,I can't believe that people are calling this clever...,"There is absolutely nothing clever or unique about this show. Adult cartoons have been done many times before and much, much better I might add. I have nothing against raunchy humor as long as it's well written (or at least funny) which Drawn Together is not. This shouldn't be surprising considering Adam Carolla's involvment. His heavy reliance on shock value and toilet ""humor"" has never made me laugh.The idea behind the show isn't bad. With decent writers, a parody of reality television could be very witty and original. This potential is consistantly squandered though being that the show would rather go for the poop joke. It's a shame the the show is such a waste. A waste of opportunities and a waste of time..."
5,*Oh God damnit !*,This series was the coolest one when it was released on T.V. I can't wait for Season 2!
5,The most hilarious reality TV show ever!!,"If you like eight totally different characters spoofing the genres they've come from, with the irony and radical humor of The Simpsons' Itchy and Scratchy mixed in, you'll love this show!This is really an innovation which strains not only (what many people would consider) decency but your stomach muscles as well, for this show simply sprouts gags about just anything! Nothing is taboo, from racism and anti-semitism to movie scenes and famous people, EVERYTHING is dealt with. If you are not too sensitive about sensitive topics, then watch it and love it!"
3,Not bad.. could be better,"Other than the fact that season ONE is pale in comparison to SEASON 2, this DVD has some features missing.Multi-language closed captioning options.how can I share this great show with my french friends??I hope they get this regulated by SEASON 2."
5,THE ONLY REALITY SHOW WORTH WATCHING!,"I HATE THESE REALITY SHOWS THAT ARE POPPING UP ON EVERY CHANNEL! THEY'RE THE REASON I ASK WHY WERE STAR TREK & THE X-FILES CANCELED?BUT WHEN A SHOW IS MADE TO MOCK THESE HOME VIDEO TYPE HOURS, I JUST LOVE IT! IF REALITY TV ISN'T A MOCKERY, THEN YOU BETTER GIVE ME MORE ENTERPRISE/VOYAGER/DEEP SPACE NINE/THE NEXT GENERATION/THE ORIGINAL SERIES/ THE ANIMATED SERIES/THE MOTION PICTURES, OR AN X-FILES STARRING ROBERT PATRICK & ANNABETH GISH . . ."
4,DVDs different from TV,"In ""Clara's Cousin"" on TV, all the characters on the short bus were shown as humans. On The DVD they were messed up versions of the shows main characters (Spanky, Hero, Ling Ling, etc). Several spots of the music were changed as well. Not sure, but almost liking the original TV versions better. I didn't buy seasons 2&3 for these reasons."
3,VOD Drawn Together Censored!,"At least Drawn Together season one is censored I havnt seen the others .I rented season 1 to see if i liked it and did.I decided to try VOD version for a 11 bucks,theres blurs and bleeps that wasnt on the DVD,so beware. Amazon should mention this since they advertise VOD with the Uncensored DVD version."
4,absolutley hilarious! 7 episodes on the dvd not 8,"******the description above in the storyline is wrong there are 7 episodes on the dvd not 8. *******You really got to see this , but its not for children.Laf'd my a$$ off! I would rate it at a 5, but it purposely choose not to include the episode where Captain Hero (superman spoof) spies on the girls in the shower with his x-ray vision. Foxy Love develops a brain tumor from the x-ray radiation, and Captian Hero driven by guilt tries to give up his super powers by falling of a horse and becoming a parapalegic . this episode has never aired and has purposely been left out due to christopher reeves tragic death."
3,Nothing New... Even Then.,"Considered one of the classics of black pulp fiction by many, this story of a young boy's gradual slide into a life of crime with Brooklyn gangsters owes a lot to Jim Thompson, especially in its Oedipal sexual themes. In fact, I think that if the author had been white, the book would probably not have garnered the praise it has and would be regarded as yet another Thompson imitator. In any event, while the insights into the criminal life might have been new stuff in 1962, there are no great surprises to found within the pages for the modern reader who has probably seen Goodfellas, et al."
3,"Very cute, but high maintenance","I bought this rug to go over a carpeted floor, to coordinate with my younger daughter's bedroom. I had previously purchased a sturdy princess castle rug at Costco for my older daughter's floor, and I was surprised that this rug was as light as it was. It is very cute, but seems quite lightweight and thin for the price. It also gets quite dirty, even though we don't wear shoes in the room. So my bottom line is mixed - it is very cute, but needs constant cleaning. Think twice before you buy this rug."
1,NOT TO MY TASTE...AN ABSOLUTE WASTE,"This album was recommended by AMAZON, if you like what I like - know that this music will not suit the soul. This album has nothing that I would say is genius or moving.Like I say, NOT TO MY TASTE, AS I LISTEN IT IS AN ABSOLUTE WASTE."
4,Go Go Godzilla!,"I love this CD because I grew up listening to this stuff. My mom still has ""Some Enchanted Evening"" on Vinyl and when I was a very small child, I would sit in the floor and eat this stuff up! Too bad I scratched the album jumping around on the floor while ""Godzilla"" played. I was a chunky child. LOL. Anyway, my very favorites are ""Godzilla"" and ""Don't fear the Reaper"" because they sounded sweet even on Vinyl and they hardly ever play them on the radio. I was amazed at how much clearer the songs are on this CD than on my mom's old vinyl album. Just goes to show you how times change. Rock on."
1,They should pay YOU for this one...,"I had always liked the tune ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" and I thought it would be great to finally have a CD of it. I decided that a greatest hits package was probably the way to go as I could hear what other tunes were considered ""good' by this band. Boy was I in for a surprise!! Except for the aforementioned song this CD is absolutely terrible!! If these songs are considered their greatest, I shudder at the thought of what their regular release albums must contain!!! This is the stuff of musical nightmares!!! However, if you're looking for a good laugh purchase this CD and take a listen (with your friends) to the tune Godzilla. The music and lyrics are soooooo bad, you can't help but go into hysterics. My friends and I were rolling on the ground for over half an hour. Pure B-grade Cheese. Avoid at all costs!!!!"
3,The Best Of BOC,"I am not a hardcore BOC fan, so this CD did the trick for me. I bought this disc for Burning for you and Don't fear the reaper. I ended up being quite impressed. There were another few tracks that wern't that bad. The CD satisfied my needs, but only gets three stars due to the fact, that it's about a 60-70 percent CD.This is a great buy though for the price if it has the BOC songs you're looking for (which I'm sure it does)My top 5:Burning for youDon't fear the reaperCities on flame with rock and rollGodzillaRU Ready 2 Rock"
3,BOC at a glance,"This is a nice sampling of Blue Oyster Cult's material. It's not the best compilation but at least it has ""Burnin' For You"" and ""Don't Fear the Reaper"". Worth a listen."
3,Complicated cable manager,"This product is great in theory, but did not solve all my cable management problems. Our cable modem was too big to fit on the tiny ""shelf"", so it still sits on the floor. My desk has a little curve to the top, and is too nice to drill holes to attach the Cable Manager, so I had to use the clamp feature. It is heavy and has already fallen off at random. However, it does encourage you to really organize your cables and get them off the floor."
5,Keep our cables off the Floor,"Our office is better because of these. With several hundred employees, getting the janitorial crew to vacuum under our desks was a challenge. Now ALL of the offices can be cleaned and get all the dust and allergens cleaned up every week.Thank you for such a simple solution."
3,"Great design, poor execution","Looked great in theory, bought it and found issues that prevent me from really using it. Cheap plastic parts that can't hold any substantial weight, bent under the weight of a modem and a vonage adapter. The shelf is tiny, not big enough to hold anything more than 4 -5 inches deep. Would not recommend it for anything more than standard desktop support - power adapters and cables and no more."
4,Shorter arms would be a nice option.,"This is a fantastic device, but there is a major problem that prevented me from using it.I have shallow open-backed shelving that's close to the wall. My intention was to clamp the cable manager with the clamp facing forward and the cable tray also facing forward, with the arms pointing into the shelving.But I found that the arms are far too long and point into the shelving so far that they interfere with objects on the shelf. And there just isn't enough room between the shelf and the wall to fit the cable manager with the arms pointing towards the wall.What I need are optional half-length arms, maybe 3 inches long instead of the usual 6.Until then, I can't really use the cable manager. It's a great enough idea and design that I'm keeping it for future use. I know that I'll find the perfect application for it sooner or later."
3,SO SO Book but in PERFECT CONDITION,This book was OK but it missed the opportunity to go deeper into the way the two Jesus children were incorporated into one being who became the Christ.
2,"Product Okay, supplier sent previously opened product","Although, as stated in the subject, the product was as I expected, I found once I got it to the location I was actually using it, that it was missing parts. The original packing box had obviously been opened. I discovered this when I unboxed it from the Amazon packaging. I thought I checked it thoroughly for missing pieces but apparently not. The screw that holds the pump handle to the pump was missing. As I said, I didn't discover this until I was trying to use it. Though I accept the blame for not checking carefully, I still feel it is incumbent upon the supplier (either directly or via Amazon) to insure the item is complete and intact prior to shipping."
5,Fink delivers a classic his first album,"It's rare that I find an album that I can listen to on my walkman without ever skipping a song. This is one of those albums. I found this listening to albums in a Paris music store. This was my first choice and it has grown to be one of my favorites. The album delivers a smoky, underground cafe sound that is both blues and funky at the same time. The lyrics are classic themes made fresh. I highly recommend this to lovers of great music. I can't wait for the next album."
5,"Gentle, Fun, Faithful Games to Introduce Babies to God","This book is awesome. It basically gives you a game/song/activity that's appropriate for infants & toddlers on each page. It gives a scripture verse that's referenced in the game and ways to make the game work for kids above or below the game's intended level. It gives a list of needed supplies (usually nothing, although occasionally there's an item or two needed to play a game) and it also gives tidbits about child development along the way.This is a GREAT resource for those who recognize that even the youngest infants can be introduced to scripture and God's love while realizing that an elaborate, over-done program is likely wasted energy for kids so young. You could totally play the games in this book during church services straight through and (since kids grow up and move on to the next class), start all over again with the new group! Gentle, fun, faithful guide for telling babies about God!"
4,Very Nice,"I got this shirt for my boyfriend on his birthday this past March. He absolutely loved it. Its pretty basic and doesn't shrink. Of course, the Wizards have recently changed their colors to red, white, and blue, so if you're looking for more updated sportswear, I wouldn't get this shirt. Reason I gave it a 4/5, but at the time it was perfect."
4,"Nice addition to the series, but...","I find myself in a bit of a quandary as to how to review WATER LIKE A STONE. On the one hand, this is an extremely well written, suspenseful mystery with an intriguing plot line and great characters. On the other hand, being that I am a fan of this series, I am a bit disappointed that Duncan and Gemma seem to be relegated to nothing more than side characters in this book.One of the things I've always like about this series has been the dynamics in the relationship between Duncan and Gemma. Here however, there is no chemistry between them and whatever interaction they have seems forced.Crombie does have a knack for writing great, well-defined characters. All of these characters, from Juliet to Annie to the Wains are really interesting and made for a great story. I will say however, that I'm a little tired of the story line involving Kit. There needs to be a bit less of him from now on.I'll give this a reluctant 4 star rating. It's really more of a 3 1/2 for me."
3,Water Like a Stone,I have now read all the Gemma James and Duncan Kindcaid nevels by Deborah Crombie. This was not a favorite. It was too slow and annoying and I really didn't care who did it.
3,A Good Read,"I found ""Water Like a Stone"" a more serious book than Deborah Crombie's last book ""In A Dark House."" The subject matter was more dark than that book. It seems like she was taking a page from Martha Grimes at times. While the book was enjoyable from the development of all the familiar characters, the multiple story lines were a bit much with a more minor character turning out to be the killer. It almost seemed like Ms. Crombie expected someone else to be the killer. The flashbacks provided some character development of what kind of person the killer was but when it came time to be revealed, it didn't quite connect. Despite that, I was relieved at the resolution of some of the conflicts that had carried over from another book or two."
3,Slightly above average for the genre,"I can't say this book was captivating or that it provided great social commentary amidst the mystery/crime. There was no sense of can't put it down. And it certainly didn't have the character depth or social commentary of Elizabeth George's books.On the other hand, it was enjoyable to read, had a ending that wasn't completely predictable, and provided a good environmental portrait.Paul S"
3,Editing needed,"I like this series in theory but this recent one is a little too conventional in nature. Plus I am not a big fan of reading about what is going on in some sociopath's mind, I find that technique distracting and unnecessary."
5,The Best of French Decor,I first discovered Charles while touring the Governor's Mansion in Oklahoma (my Mother's home state) and the decor was FAB. I just had to find out who the decorator was and then I discovered his two books on french ideas. So wonderful and they are now in my library. The photographs are so inspiring and have given me ideas on how to move things around. Wish I could afford to hire him!!
3,Country French Living,"I gave it an ok rating because it is not as casual as I had hoped, and not as many photos as I had hoped."
3,"Beautiful rooms, but not French","This is a lovely book. However, I was looking for a book with rooms that had a true french feel. These rooms, while beautifuly and lushly decorated, have a distinctly American look."
3,Not Much New,"This is not a bad book, just nothing special. Per se, I don't believe this is necessarily country living-- neither is it French nor English. In that way, it is Mr Fauderee's signature. Nevertheless, his efforts are not unique nor groundbreaking; and I am left with the proverbial ""Been there, done that""."
3,"Not enough ""Carpenters""","Although I liked the CD in general, I thought there were too many instrumentals included, when what I was really looking for was a collection of Christmas songs with Karen's beautiful voice!"
2,"FIVE STARS, NOT TWO! Simply the Best Christmas Album Ever - the Carpenters","I have a collection of at least 30 different Christmas albums that I have bought over the years; everything from Frank Sinatra to the Macarena Christmas (ugh) and everything in between. While many of these albums/CDs are wonderful, nothing in my mind compares with the album put together by The Carpenters. Karen Carpenter sings like an angel and will make every hair stand up on your body and bring tears to your eyes with her versions of Ave Maria, I'll be Home for Christmas, Silent Night and more. Her brother, Richard, plays the piano throughout and his music is wonderful.Everyone that I know who owns this collection says the same thing. This is simply the best Christmas Album Ever. I cannot recommend The Carpenters Christmas Collection more highly. If you don't have it, get it today. It's too bad Karen, that angel, was taken from us at such a young age."
3,Great CD collection,"I received the CD collection of the Carpenters Christmas music. It was one I had been wanting for some time, but never sat down to the computer to make the order. I have enjoyed listening to it. as you can see, It is January 26th and I am just now writing this review. Even though the CD's are great, they came so late that I thought I was not gong to get them. it was rather misleading as to how long it would be for delivery. Thank you again for the CD and attempt to make your delivery a bit quicker. Happy New Year and may God bless."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I really looked forward to receiving the Carpenter Christmas CD set, however I was very disappointed to have so many songs instrumental, as well as being sung by others. I thought Karen would be singing all the songs and thats what I wanted to hear."
1,Carpenters Christmas,I was very disappointed with the cds. There is nothing to indicate in the product description that many of the songs are not vocals by Karen. Had I known I would not have purchased this product.
4,Perfect Christmas Album,It's a great Christmas album! I miss Karen's voice. Singers today spend too much time yodelling instead of singing. They would do a service to the world if they would do like Karen and just sing the song.
5,Extraordinary,Mesmerizing. What beautiful work; glorious arrangements and heavenly production sung by the voice of an angel! Superb!
5,exquisite and incomparable,"While most christmas recordings get stale after only a few passes over the laser or tape deck, very few truly make a lasting impression on anyone especially after the holidays are over. The carpenters' christmas double cd issue is one such recording that will delight any listener - young and old alike . One need not be a fan to appreciate these timeless recordings issued for the first time in its entirety on cd! From Richard's exceptional keyboard and arrangement abilities (although not all songs were his arrangements) to Karen's superior alto vocals, one can't help but be captivated by this exquisite and incomprable compilation of holiday favorites. The distinctive qualities of this compilation are the collection of songs which range from the common to the sometimes unheard of and of course the classic sound that is a trademark of the carpenters. This is one cd everyone must have - timeless and a true gem!"
5,"What can I say, ""this one is the absolute best!""","Of all the collections of Christmas songs available on the market, this one stands out as the clear leader. The combination of Karen's unmistakable voice and Richard's smooth, flowing arrangements simply can't be beat."
5,Perfect!,"LOVED WHAT I PURCHASED, GREAT PRICE, CAME QUICK & IN GREAT CONDITION. . . .NEED I SAY MORE? LOVE AMAZON!"
5,The Greatest Christmas CD,"This is easily the best Christmas CD I have. Virtually every song is a winner. I play this CD numerous times every Christmas season, and I never get tired of it. Their version of What Are You Doing New Years Eve? is my favorite version of that song. The CD is definitely a Christmas classic."
5,carpenters - wonderful!,The Carpenters greatest hits CD is outstanding and brings back such great memories. I highly recommend it.
5,jazz masterpiece!,"CHRISTMAS COLLECTION is the only jazz standard album that karen carpenter ever recorded and it is a masterpiece-equal to ella fitzgeralds famed SONGBOOK albums.these 2 albums were recorded in 1978{except for 3 instrumental tracks added in 1984},and utilize jazz and symphonic orchestras on this stellar collection of torch and swing arrangements.More of these jazz-type arrangements can be found on VOICE OF THE HEART and LOVELINES.Outtakes from the CHRISTMAS PORTRAIT sessions{ ""look to your dreams "" , ""little girl blue"",etc} were included on those 2 albums."
5,A holiday must!,"In 1978, at the age of 12, I bought my first Christmas album, ""Christmas Portrait."" Since then I have over 30 christmas CD's and ""Christmas Portrait"" is still the best of them all. Karen's warm voice is the very essence of Christmas music. Though there is not enough of it on ""An Old Fashioned Christmas,"" the sound of true Christmas music still resonates therein. Standouts include Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Ave Maria, I heard the bells on Christmas day, and Little Altar Boy. It has been a long time coming, but it is a joy to have them both on CD. Those of us who know the music much too well, will notice a slight variation of Karen's voice in ""Sleigh Ride."" It sounds as if to be an alternate recorded take that Richard substituted for this CD. Christmas is not Christmas without the music of Karen and Richard."
4,one complaint about what should be a great set...,"Having kept my two vinyl records around for years because only the edited single Carpenters Christmas Collection was available, I was thrilled when this CD was released. BUT, I was devastated when I discovered Richard took his remixing one step too far on the first CD. There is one glaring change that really bothers me. On the original recording, the segue between White Christmas and Ave Maria is played by an organ with a weird but beautiful reverb sound...on this mastering of the collection, the part was replayed with a piano!!! It just does not segue as smoothly into Ave Maria, which is accompanied by the same organ that led into it! I had to keep my single Carpenters Christmas CD just for that original mix!!! Also, it would be nice if the original 45 mix of the jazzy Santa Claus Is Coming to Town would eventually show up on one of their compilations instead of the remix that contains a very different instrumental break in the middle."
5,Probably the best Christmas album,"If you like Christmas music, I don't think there is a better singer of the classics than Karen Carpenter. A must add to any collection"
5,Love the music!,"Always enjoyed the Carpenters Christmas music the best. Just puts the family in the mood for the celebration. Came quickly and was in great shape, Thanks!"
3,"Rock And Roll, Hoochie Koo: The Ultimate Ringtone","This is one of thousands of rock music compilations, and I really bought it for one reason: it has the nearly impossible to find ""Rock And Roll, Hoochie Koo"" from good-humored guitar wonder (and now television commercial star,) Rick Derringer. For just having that classic hit the set deserves two stars, but I awarded it a third star for the presence of the classics ""Cat Scratch Fever"" and ""Frankenstein.""Needless to say, the set, being a compilation, features some quality-challenged and pretentious music as well, most annoyingly ""Carry On Wayward Son,"" which I never need to hear again, not to mention the questionable inclusion of ""How Will I Laugh Tomorrow"" by Suicidal Tendencies.On an interesting side note, Sony has now made a major foray into the cellular telephone ringtone market, with many of these songs available for purchase as ringtones, should you be so inclined. Now every time my phone rings people think Rick Derringer is calling me."
1,"HORRIBLE DVD,THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED","I agree with another reviewer these girls are all pornstars(yuck) and not really Penthouse Pets. To make a real Girls Of Penthouse DVD have some lovely Penthouse Pets pose like Tracie Carmichael(June 2000),Juliet Cariaga(POTY 2000),Karrie Jacobs(Janurary 2002)and Megan Mason(POTY 2002) instead of nasty tatooed devon and chunky aria giovania. In addition this production was doomed with dark lighting and scenes that were shot at what looks to be Motel Inn. Just look at the beautiful Pet Of The Year 2000 Winner Disc it has Juliet Cariaga by a pool that shows the palm trees blowing in the background. Now that is a DVD with class and quality. SKIP THIS DVD AT ALL COSTS UNLESS PORN STARS ARE YOUR THING INSTEAD OF PRETTY MODELS THAT AREN'T GETTING PAID TO HAVE SEX LIKE THESE NASTY GIRLS IN THIS FLICK"
2,NO -RANGE OF GAMES Available,"The player is very very nice, however NO choice of games available-NO games that would must apeal to girls say age 8-11.No stores stock the games and none listed on Amazon.com."
1,What's the use??,"We bought two video now Colors, and a video Now Jr. for our kids, thinking it would be fun for the car. However with standard batteries not one of them lasts for more than 5 minutes. I spent money on the more expensive (M3) batteries, and they seem to last longer. However at $9 a pack that seems a bit pricey, even the rechargables don't hold up well in the players."
1,Dead on arrival near dead after charge,"I bought two batteries at a real low price...You get what you pay for.The life of these batteries (4 pictures ea. than dead...after full change)was much lower than the price.Forget the money loss...this crap wasted my time, fa-ged-a-about-it."
3,Great book for every father,"This is an excellent book for concrete application of God's love to the practice of being a father. I have not yet even begun to put into practice all the truths to be found in this book. I will continue to try, though."
3,Worked fine until it it popped apart from the battery swelling,I had my charging and noticed the case was coming apart and could not be pushed back together. So I took it on apart and found the battery had swollen up so much that it forced the board up and the case apart. It was an OK player while it lasted.
3,It's a USB drive too?? - - Read the requirements,"Note: These nifty little players are also advertised as a ""USB Drive"" but only as long as Windows Media Player 10 is installed. Windows does not see this as a USB drive, but as a Mobile Device. So unless the machine you plug this into has Windows Media Player 10 on it, don't expect to be able to plug into any machine and be able to transfer files to it.Aside from that; very cool player for the size, features and the fact that you don't have to use an external plug to connect it to your PC."
1,JUNK,"Same as most of these other reviews. I owned it for 2 1/2 months, my computer no longer reads it. There is a tone when i plug it in signifying its plugged in and two seconds later the same tone sounds and the screen shuts off on the player. I can not add/remove/or view any files on the player now. Six other of my friends computers will not read it either now so its not my computer. But hey, at least I can still listen to the small library of songs still on it....."
1,Don't buy it!,"This is the 3rd Samsung mp3 player I have owned and its giving me problems!! I don't know exactly what it is, but Samsung mp3 players are sooo problematic! My first one had a battery failure, so it would not charge, my second one didn't even turn on, and now my third one which is the one you are looking at now, decides it dosen't want to be read by the computer anymore. It constantly keeps making that windows sound that its connected and then 2 sec. later it says it has been dis-connected. I really dont know what it is!!!! All i know is that this is the last Samsung Mp3 player that I buy and I hope and pray that I can find a better alternative."
1,I HATE THIS GAME!,"i bought this game for my son and it is not fun, very inappropriate, the graphics suck and it has no end to it!!! It's very durable because I tried to shred it but the game would not be destroyed!!!"
4,Great family fun!!!!,"We got this game as an after Christmas present and we are really enjoying it. My husband and I started playing it together after the kids went to bed. We found ourselves laughing out loud and getting very competitive w/eachother. We started playing it when the kids were doing homeowrk one night and it turned into a family event. Those w/certian ""control"" abilities were handed the game controller to take on the task at hand. When it was a single challenge each person got their chance to clear that part of the game.Family game night now has another option in our house. No longer is it just board games.We also enjoy the new Kim Possible What's the Switch game."
4,AWESOME GAME!!!!,"It is no surprise to me that the box says ""playstation 2 greatest hits"" I played this on my ps2 and loved it!Apart from being fun this game has some gross parts (there are giant snails that you take eyeballs from) but that is the only problem with it.So, if you are a shrek and video game lover (I love shrek and video games) or just looking for a fun game then I would recommend this game for you!"
2,Very disappointing game for the money,"I bought the game for my 10 y.o. son who had a birthday this past weekend. He loved the earlier Shrek game, as well as the movie, so I thought it was a safe bet. The game is rated E but it has very inappropriate jokes and acts. He was bored with it after a couple of hours. He played a bit again yesterday and he completed it before noon. It's a very short game. The game looks better than the first game, but it was very short with little ""fun"" factor for the kids. It's really not worth $50, not even $20."
5,Great Game for all!!,"I bought this game several months ago.I liked this game! I thought it was cute and I didn't think the graphics were awful like some of the other reviews.My 4 yr.old daughter can play the first few levels,but after that they get a little to hard for her(that's the way it is w/most of the playstation games).This is a cool game and I reccomend it to anyone."
5,Great game for a great movie,"Shrek 2 is a great little game.Most licensed games suck. Its a historical fact. There have been a couple of good ones recently and Shrek 2 adds to the list and provides probably the best example of a licensed game for the younger crowd. It also adds an very well done 4-player element with players able to join/un-join whenever they want. That's gotta be good for parents who may want to play along and for inviting friends over, etc.Fast-paced, funny and good looking. Good job Shrek!"
4,"Too short , but liked it.","Okay , the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is too short.Above all, it was cool. Me and my brother finished it in a few weeks.That's all i have to say,Thank you, Thank you very much."
3,Un buen paso de Rey Ruiz,"Regreso Rey Ruiz despues de 3 años sin grabar un disco, en el recoge la ecencia de lo que es Rey Ruiz. Es verdad que el disco puede caer un un poco en la monotonia pero el que sea fanatico de Rey quedara muy complacido de este disco. ""Mi Tentacion"" es el primero para Rey Ruiz para Sony Discos despues de varios años de separacion. ""Creo En El Amor"" es el primer corte promocional y esta buenisimo por eso se encuentra entre los primeros lugares de la revista Billboard, en fin Sony esta haciendo el trabajo con el, trabajo que no puede mermar si lo quieren mantener. Si puedo decir que este disco no iguala a ""Fenomenal"" su disco anterior que estuvo exelente en todo los sentidos. En fin Rey tiene futuro todavia, todo depende de Sony Discos."
3,"Good product, but . . . .","This is a great product and works perfectly for adjusting your rear camber. Only problem (and I write this only because it was a PITA and took two people to do it) is the material around the 13mm locking nut used on the T15 bolt. There is too much material around the 13mm nut to get a wrench or socket on it in order to turn/hold the nut to tighten it. There is very limited room once the camber arm is installed in order to turn either the T15 bolt or the 13mm nut. I ended up rounding a couple of the points on the nut. Poor design of that area, but the rest of the unit is great. If it was not for that one issue I would have giving this review a 5 star."
4,camber kit,the item fitted well and was not a problem to install. it was of good quality and adjusted the wheel appropriately. thought it was a bit expensive but it was worth it in the long run.
2,Misleading looks,"I expected a soft cotton finish, but it is annoying finish with longer hair than you see in the picture.I would recommend to go for more expensive item to have better quality.I wanted to return, but Amazon charging $6.85 +$5 (to pick up from home).So I just kept it though I didn't liked it at all."
2,Fair only,"Not one of Buchan's more rewarding works, this novel finds the author in a mournful and disappointed mood. Largely concerned with the doings of a Scots minister in an impoverished lowlands town in the mid seventeenth century, we are tortuously given a social history in microcosm. David Sempill is involved in plots of witchcraft, rural poverty and a bizarre epidemic, Anglo-Scottish border wars and ultimately flight over the seas.In no sense are we swept up into the life or adventures of the hero, as we are say with Richard Hannay in 'Greenmantle' or Dickson McCunn in 'Huntingtower'; both very different classes of hero but both extremely engaging. David Sempill fails the test of engagement and we remain sharply on the side lines, slightly uninterested observers of a time we can hardly credit occured"
1,Damaged,"Calendar was damaged when arrived. Box was beat up and the calendar inside the box was crinkled and torn. I was happy with the item itself, just wish it would have arrived in better shape."
2,No dust but it doesn't stop as quickly as the OEM pads,"Got these pads because I was tired of dealing with the dust of the brake pads, these however don't stop well when cold. They are okay when they are warmed up but until that time they just don't work well."
5,great buy,"great buy for anyone looking for a low cost part, but yet a great product, would recomend to anyone... thanks"
3,Audio Technica Lavalier Microphone Clip,The part of clip that hold mic is OK but the part that attaches to shirt/coat is weak and allows the clipped mic to move on the shirt/coat causing irritating noise.
3,If ony there was ink!,"I was so excited to open on Christmas morning. I had picked out exactly what I wanted, and Santa delivered. Unfortunately, when I tried to write, my ""Blue pen of Authority"" skipped, and what ink was there was Black, not Blue! What a tease. I will buy a refill in blue, but it's kind of like being a kid and getting a new toy, but with no batteries, you cannot play with it till the next day! Is this to be expected?!?!?!"
5,Invaluble Research Tool,"I actually purchased this from a bookstore back in 1988-89, then it was priced at over $100! I got it at a discount because there was a flaw in the binding. I wanted a Bible study resource that went beyond the concordances that were available at the time. Compared to some of the other Bible dictionaries that I've used this one reads more like an encyclopedia. It combines archaeological, anthropologic, and ancient historical data to give one a completely unbiased account of Biblical related facts. Another cool thing is the magnificent pictures of ancient artifacts spread throughout. I don't possess another reference book that comes close. I'm thinking of purchasing another because I've used this one so much in the last 20 years that it's starting to fall apart. It's worth the money."
5,Harper Collins Bible Dictionary,The book arrived in excellent condition (new). I owned this book before but it was lost in a fire. I have used it extensively and is a vital part of my library.
2,Sent mine back,"I see that everyone else loves these spatulas, but I'm wondering what they are using to hold them with -- the handles are horrible. They are just thin, sharp metal. Are you all using gloves or mitts or something? I agree they probably are great with regard to heat-resistance, but the handles are extremely uncomfortable."
2,"Great size, but very uncomfortable handles","I was searching for a large spatula and the 12"" one in this set fits the need spectacularly. The silicone is great, dishwasher safe, and has all the advantages listed in the product description and other reviews without question. The big issues are the stainless steel handles. They are solid, hefty, but only about 1/8"" thick and flat. If you use the spatulas for very light duties this is not a problem. But if you are folding egg whites into a batter any thicker than waffles or scraping cookie dough down the sides of your stand mixer bowl, these handles are just painful. We've replaced with another set."
1,Will return these,"I have to agree with others who complain about the handles. They are sharp edged, too wide and HEAVY!The length of the silicone end is also a problem. When using a rubber spatula for folding delicate egg whites or whipped cream, the heavy blade smashes the air bubbles out of the mixture. In addition, if the handles become wet or a little oily, they are way too slippery. Give me a soft wooden handle anytime."
2,Painful handles,These looked like such great spatulas but when they arrived we discovered that those stainless steel handles are flat and hard to hold and hurt our hands so we sent them back.
4,Great product,"The spatulas are great for cooking in a coated pan but they are a little stiff. Have not had any problems with melting discoloring or getting misshapen from the heat. Overall, its a great product"
3,I'ts seem more small that appearance,It's more big that I thought and not have 1.5 Gbytes... there is more less 1.3x GB.
3,A little big but ok.,"It is nice, a little big, but OK. It is more like 1.3Giga Bytes rather than 1.5 GB. But it is oks."
1,Don't Bother,"A complete waste of money. The main character is so whiny, you couldn't care less about her. Not that the other five or so confusing relationships interest you either.I've read other Penny Jordan books that were pretty decent, so I won't write her off, but this one I could have saved my money."
2,"Disappointing, given the author's priviledged position...","With all due respect and in deference to the views of previous readers' reviews, as a techno-geek turned venture capitalist and self-described futurist, I find this treatise to be utterly disappointing, lacking in vision, and thoroughly contemporary. Save your book-buying funds and read something else, PLEASE!!"
2,Nothing inspiring nor new here...,"Dertouzos churns out the usual 'information wil change the future' vision that dominates books of this nature. Unfortunately, nothing here is really new, nor does Dertouzos write with much passion nor pizazz - his pronouncements come across as somewhat pretentious and trite. I prefer Esther Dyson's Release 2.0, which hawks much the same vision but in a nicely homey, conversational style that reveals how personal her book is compared to this one."
3,Really no news to experienced technology buffs.,"This really is for people ""trying to make sense of this Internet/computer business."" There is little new or insightful here, especially when the author strays from his field of expertise-- the technology itself. The beginning to intermediate reader will find his thoughtful explanations of current technology helpful and unbiased. The extrapolations into how the technology will affect our lives and institutions are far less convincing or believable. Take the sociology and politics with a grain of salt-- and ask your self simple questions on the extrapolations of technology that he provides. For example, in one futuristic scenario he has a computer check the weather, a company database and a database containing the contents of clean clothes in a commuters closet to determine what outfit the person should wear that day. Would you pay for this? Would you even allow this to happen in your home"
3,A highly imaginative yet plausible glimpse of the future.,"Michael Dertouzos' book, ""What will be"", discusses technology in three areas, the past and how technology and his life intertwined, the present and how technology affects our everyday life, and the future offering a highly imaginative yet plausible glimpse of what we may expect in out lifetime. Skip parts one ""Shaping the Future"" and part three ""Reuniting Technology and Humanity"" which are repetitive and unoriginal and concentrate on part two ""How Your Life Will Change"" the book will be enjoyable"
2,"Little New, Negroponte (the other MIT Lab guy) is better","I've come to expect alot from MIT, but Dertouzos' effort in ""What Will Be."" is a disappointment because it contains little that hasn't been said by others. In fact, Nicholas Negroponte in his 1995 book ""Being Digital"" (the other MIT Lab guy) said most if not all of what Dertouzos does here-- nearly two years ago!The author has an annoying habit of telling you what he's going to tell you about-- literally. On the up side some of his individual short scenes of how he expects daily life to change in the digital age are good. But he does stray into the ""Jetsons"" by describing the kitchen of the future.If you expected new insights or cutting edge advice on how the Internet will change your personal life, it's been said better elsewhere. Don't expect much help with your business either (I'd recommend ""The Digital Estate"" by Chuck Martin). Or get a subscription to WIRED magazine."
4,Easy and fast,"This is really a nice and complete cookbook. Has every kind of appetizers, quick and easy together with beautiful pictures. My only complain (that's why only 4 stars) is that when it comes to make pizzas, tarts or rolls, it uses only can refrigerated products; I would have liked the chance to make them on my own.The book includesDips and spreadsCold appetizers like deviled eggs and stuffed tomatosHot appetizers like meatballs and bruschettaSnacks and beverages, featuring Sangria, different kinds of punches and much moreSo in the end I truly recommend it to people searching for easy tried and true recipes without much fuss. Instead, if you want appetizers that you can make from scratch then I'll suggest the appertizer book by Eric Treuille"
5,Pillsbury Appetizers,Excellent appetizer recipes for parties. I have used this book a lot. Have used it for party appetizers on several occasions and the appetizers have been a big success.Both simple and not so simple appetizer recipes. Something for everyone no matter what level their cooking skills are at.
4,Business Traveler's Road Atlas,"This handy little book is great for the traveler. With details of airports and most cities, you will have everything you need to make it from the airport, to your hotel, to your meeting, and home again. I found it is perfect for the places you go to infrequently. Small and compact for the amount of info. Just wish you could buy annual versions."
4,just buy it,"it saved me time as a mid-tier DBA. the writing was concise and well-written. Examples were included and test cases to ensure your work.good book, worth the few bucks."
1,"This book has a wrong title, how can the content be right ?","I have heard about a book ""oracle internals"" and I was curious to learn whats going on inside oracle; Instead, if I skim the table of contents I find that its a tohuwabohu of tips and tricks for everybody and noone.Nothing about internals just the usual stuff you can find everywhere. The title of this book is deceptive, I fear the content will be too and I will never buy (less read) it !"
5,"Laugh, cry, schedule an emergency session","Finally a book that deals tongue-in-cheek with our Issues with a capital ""I.""Meredith Cohen (""Ms. Behavior"") once wrote about the pesky boundary situations that can occur between lesbians and their (oftentimes) lesbian therapists and this book provides ample evidence of this. From one woman (oops womyn? :) seeing her therapist naked at the gym, to a client who uses a therapist's home bathroom and has to have the therapist pass toilet paper through the cracked door..well, you get the picture.This book will definitely make you laugh, so buy one for the next time your therapist is on a vacation. Until prozac goes generic, it's the next best thing...."
1,hostile,"Well, as a queer client and therapist, I thought most of these pieces were unbelievably hostile. Very few were affectionate, and thus the collection didn't mirror the attitude of the majority of lesbians I've ever talked with, socially or professionally. A much more accurate (and funny) depiction of lesbian client/lesbian therapist issues, for example, can be found in any volume of any ""Dykes to Watch Out For.""The overwhelming anger of this volume made me very sad. No, I wouldn't put this in my waiting room. Not because it pokes fun, but because it is not funny."
4,Nice,Does everything expected of it. The one thing I don't like is the globe glass is to thin and breaks easily.
5,excellent lantern,This product is excellent. Its nice to have a case where you can put your lantern away when not in use. I highly recommend this item.
2,Poor Design of the case,The carry case is a clam shell design. The hinge is is plastic and will split apart after a few uses. I ordered 5 of these items for a Boy Scout troop. One of the cases was already broken on arrival.
4,review of Coleman Lantern,"It is a good, well-engineered product, like most Coleman products. My guess is it will not withstand alot of use however. I wish it were made of brass or aluminum machined castings rather than as much plastic as it has built into it. The stand (bottom) probably won't hold up for long. The case is really nice and protects the lantern in transit very well."
5,Excellent service and product,Lantern was a birthday gift and exceeded the expectation of the recipient. She loved the lantern and tried it out in the home prior to the camping trip.
5,"good product, great case","Got this lantern very quickly from Amazon. I haven't actually used out in the wild, but I have used it at home. It works great and I really like the carrying case to keep in protected during storage and packing."
5,Love it!!!,Just back from my son's first cub scout camp out and this lantern was flawless. I highly recommend it and would love to own a second. Ran on high for 8 hours and still had some left when we shut it down. I took it to the pack leaders dinner on Saturday night and hung it from their pavillion beam and it lit the whole surrounding area as the pack leader read stories to the scouts into the late evening hours. I cannot imagine any complaints about this product. Will order as second soon!
4,Great!,"Pros: Easy to light with long match, mantles stay functional for a good while, can be BRIIIIIGHT, or nice & dim, if you just need a small light, but don't want to burn a lot of propane.We ran our lantern for probably 9 hours over two nights, using varied brightnesses (dim for most of the time, to BRIGHT for about an hour and a half), and I still have about half a can of propane.With the carrying case, it is a heck of a deal."
5,Camp,"We needed to replace some camping gear for next summer. Amazon had good prices, what we needed, and they arrived faster than expected. It's a lot easier than going from store to store."
2,Lacks Depth,2 Stars for all of the work the author put into the book but..the book reads like a sunday comic strip. Short disjointed moments put together randomly and often quite repetetive.The author strikes an always judgemental or condescending tone throughout and his observations rarely strike true chord of pathos. Just Western dogma and superiorattitude.Most of the book seems like the author constantly complaining that about what HE cant have or do...HE cant have good food...HE cant get a bicycle..HE cant go out.I cant think of too many moments in the book where the author hits a deep note of empathy for his subjects that might illuminate true feelings in the reader.I had high hopes but was greatly disappointed.
1,It's all about the author,"I am surprised at the positive reviews of this book. Although it is interesting in some ways, it presents North Korean culture with little compassion or humanity. The author describes his visit to North Korea according to how it served his personal comfort and sense of style, and with little reference to history or context. The North Korean government notwithstanding, ridiculing the shoes worn by the women on the street and making sweeping statements about how ""all"" Asian hotels are crummy is just ignorant. And probably racist. There are many very good books about North Korea -- skip this one. If you are looking for a good graphic story about one of the countries belonging to George Bush's ""Axis of Evil,"" read Persepolis."
2,Boring,"Unfortunately, the author - a fine illustrator - has little to no original insight into North Korea, and this is a rather uninteresting and trite description of his time in the country."
4,Excellent off-beat account of a land few of us will ever see,"Guy Delisle, a French-Canadian illustrator who had the great fortune to spend two months in North Korea, has produced a charming and funny book about what happened during his stay. In truth, not much did happen to him. He was shadowed by guides and translators pretty much wherever he went and no North Korean dared talk to him about what living conditions were really like. So don't expect sensations, just a well-told (but curiously for a professional artist, not a brilliantly drawn) account of his time there. We see first-hand the frustrations of working in a town with little food, little power and virtually nothing to do apart from hang out with the small community of foreign aid workers and business executives. Highly recommended."
5,A must have for social reformers,"Taylor-Ide and Taylor have designed a method by which social change may be achieved in the international and domestic arenas. Specific examples of success and failures are given as well as a means for designing and evaluating social reform programs. For those interested in achieving success without reinventing the wheel, this is a must read."
4,Great game!,My son has had many happy hours with this game. It came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy.
4,very good,5/10/04I just got this game today and loved it.It is just another imatation of [edited] .Dont get me wrong this is a good game but I wouldnt recomend it if you arent a true shrek fan.Also if you didnt like [edited] dont get this.Also if you hated shrek 1 your in luck this is like 10 x s better.
2,Don't believe the hype...,"In addition to what David wrote above, the book has no colour photos (other than in the covers) and even the historical photos aren't that many.Most of it consists of close up shots of museum and private collection exhibits. Lack of drawings is a serious disadvantage and I still don't understand why South Lebanese Army and Ugandan tanks were not covered (they were Israeli sourced and saw combat service) when Chilean Shermans get an entire chapter. To sum up, save your money for the Lioness and Lion of the Line series and leave Gannon's book to the collectors."
1,Waste of money,"Poor quality, badly designed and needlessly heavy. The pedals were mis-labeled and tended to unscrew themselves off no matter how tightly they were screwed in. One of the tires was defective and leaked air from the moment my son began riding. I should have known better than to buy a training bike with a shock-absorber mechanism, which is a totally pointless waste of resources on what should be a simple, utilitarian machine."
4,can't find replacment inertubes,"this was a very good bike for my sone he has loved riding it for the last year but i did have to cut about 3"" off the steam of the set for him to fit it. the reason i did not rate a 5 on this though we can not find a inertube replacment for it anywhere."
4,"Great bike, but...","My son received this bike for his 3rd birthday. He is going to be 6 at the end of the summer. This bike has held up so well and I would highly recommend it! It's a very sturdy first bike. I will say that it's a little big for smaller children. My son isn't tall and at almost 6 years old, he is just able to touch the ground with his toes. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because now that we want to take the training wheels off, he's having trouble trying to balance it. It's a very heavy bike. We're going to keep working on his balance and I know he'll eventually get it...he's just having a problem with a bike that weighs about 10 lbs less than him! ;)If you are looking for a great first bike...this one is it!"
1,JUNK PRODUCT!! STAY AWAY FROM JVC,"Well, like so many other reviews, my camera worked twice before the ""Lens Cap"" error. When calling JVC customer service I received a well our recall and free repair for that defect apply to a list of other camcorders but not yours. You can send it in to have the CCD repaired for a fee. Best to throw money in the toilet than to purchase JVC. I now have a $300 football. Stay away from this camera and JVC."
1,JVC JUNK,Hardly used the camcorder. No longer works. It doesn't register a signal and shows a lens cap error even when the lens cap is off. What a disgrace. My last JVC product.
1,Just we are paying for junk,"Hi all,I bought this camcorder after seeing all the above reviews to shoot my new born baby. But when I open and charged the camera for 6 hours and try to shoot it displays "" Safe Guard mode is on Replace battery and on again"". I tried my level best to make it work, but at last I found out this is a big junk."
3,Can this model take pictures like a regular digital camera ?,"Hello, I just bought JVC camcorder with model GRDF430U, however I can not locate the place for memory card to take pictures, does somebody know if there is such feature for this model, if not I plan to return. thank you."
1,Camcode sucks!,"This camcoder is crappy. The ""lens cap"" error showed up.I am not able to record and video and also the audio that I was able to record had lot of noise."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!,"Actually, it should be 0 stars...My cell phone records better than this piece of garbage... You know why? BECAUSE AT LEAST WHEN I PRESS ""RECORD"", THE THING RECORDS!For all the reasons already mentioned here - press record, black screen, nothing happens - do not buy this product. In fact Amazon should quit trying to sell this poece of garbage if it really cares about its committment to customer quality. As for me, two cameras, same problem, and I will probably be left holding the bag for not being able to return it within the allotted return time (note to Amazon: However, I will praise your customer service to high heaven on these pages if my dilemma is resolved!)But most likely, I will be out $300 for a camera that was never designed to work from the moment you take it out of the box."
1,Don't buy this item!!!,This camcorder worked great... until it didn't work at all (lens cap error). I purchased this just four months ago... one month too long ago for the warantee to still be in effect. I have spent the past two days on the phone with JVC and keep getting the run around...they admit they have had problems... but they say not with this model so they will not fix it without me paying for it. According to the other reviews there are MANY problems with this model. My advice... don't buy this or any other JVC product! Terrible service.
1,"Amazon Sucks - Cheater, Bad Customer Services -- DON'T BUY","GuysI bought this item, in their description they say software is inculded. i called customer services, It went to some badly call center in INDIA, Where they change ther name to KIM, ALDRIN J etc. They are really bad, they don;t know how to talk to customer then lies after lies then finally they say to use common sence. NOW on i will never use AMAZON for anything. BAD SITE, SITE EMPLOYEES, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICES."
1,***BEWARE***,"I bought my camera 09/2005, I used the camera and it worked great through christmas and new years. I packed the camera in the case I bought for it and did not use it until this year Christmas. I took the camera out and got the ""lens cap"" error on Christmas morning. I did call JVC after seeing the recall on their website, however my camera is not on the list. The customer service employee told me I could pay for it to be shipped and fixed at the nearest service center to my home in Houston,TX, which was in Lawrenceville, Georia. I personally will not purchase another JVC product. I recently bought a new television and I was considering JVC, I am greatful now that I went with a Samsung."
2,Lens-Cap error - twice !!,"All complaints about lens-cap error are true. The first unit broke but was within 30 days of purchase from Amazon, and it was replaced free by Amazon. The second unit broke after about 8 months. After I paid for shipping, JVC agreed to fix it for free (maybe they know this is an issue with this model, but won't admit it officially). But after servicing, the screen door now won't latch and remain closed and there were small scratches on the outside of screen panel. JVC says I need to pay shipping again and then they'll look at things that broke during the first service. Maybe I'll just salvage what I have and live with it.Other than the above *major* issue,- I like the small size of the unit; almost fits in a big pocket- Picture quality isn't bad, but not as great as some users claim.- Like the fact that it comes with a remote.- Strap and lens-cap feel cheap"
1,Absolute junk,"This camcorder stopped working after 5 months with the ""lens cap"" error message. JVC customer service was abolutely no help. Never buy a JVC product. Get a Sony or Canon. They at least have some usefule kind of customer service."
3,Jury is still out on this one,"I received this cam as a christmas gift in 2005. Used it a few times with good results. Then about one week ago I decided to try it out again for a family event. You guessed it -- LENS CAP -- error. Looked up JVC's 800 number for repairs and called to find that the GRDF430U is NOT COVERED by the CCD service program. That meant that under the warranty terms I would not pay for parts but would have to pay for labor. I found this totally unacceptable so I asked to speak with a manager. After a moment of explaining the issue and the fact I was not happy that I'd be paying to return and fix the item, I was granted an extension on the 90 day labor warranty. I still have to pay the shipping to JVC but that's it. As of this writing I expect to receive the warranty extension in the mail so I can proceed. If this happens to you, be sure to ask to talk to a manager about this before you end up paying for JVC's problem."
1,Lens Cap Problem,"Camera worked great for one year. Then I got the message that my lens cap was on when it was not and could no linger view anything on the LCD screen. Buy something else.I spoke with customer service and I can have the part for free but must pay $150.00 for labor (more than half what I paid for the camcorder). I explained this seems like a defect with the product based on the amount of complaints for this same lens cap problem. The sales rep explained that the lens cap problem is with other JVC Camcorders not this one. I suggested JVC take a look at how many complaints were for this specific model. He didn't agree and assured me this is not a defect.I'm going to buy a 56"" big sceen tv this month. I was trying to decide between a Samsung model and a JVC model. This experience has helped to make my decision easier."
1,"Great picture quality, but lousy quality control","I bought this in Nov. 2005 to replace an ealier JVC unit that failed after about a year. After the earlier failure, I shopped around other brands but ended up liking the JVC picture quality over all the other brands. Against my better judgment I gritted my teeth and bought another JVC.But by spring 2006, my new unit was dead. One day, it produce the 'lens cap on' error that so many other people have reported, and it has never recovered. I'm now trying to contact JVC customer care... if I get my money back, I'll be very happy and I'll go immediately to a different brand for my next camcorder. There's no point in buying a camcorder that lasts only a few months.If you end up buying one of these, or any other JVC product, pay close attention to the warranty - I suspect you'll end up using it!Recommendation: avoid."
3,"Small camcorder, but really fun!","This camcorder was MUCH SMALLER than I had anticipated. It lookes much larger in the picture, but if I had looked at the dimensions a little more closely before I bought it, I would have known that!This camcorder is very compact, which makes it very handy & easy to hold. It has simple features, & would make a great camcorder for a beginner. I would recommend paying an extra $40-$50 or so to upgrade to the next model up because it has more features.So far I have had no problems with this camcorder. The video is sharp & the audio is good too.This is a good beginner camcorder for the price. However, if you are more experienced and/or want more features, I would suggest getting a better model."
1,Be aware,"Screen displayed on start up a black screen on LCD and viewfinder, with a message to remove the cap.This occured 2 dys after opening camcorder to use. No image recording was possible, only the sound recorded. Camcorder could not focus.I read reviews for this model and the 450 model and users had the same problem.So be aware."
3,Page Ripped!!!,The book was in okay condition. Some doggie-eared pages. But the one thing that keeps irking me is the fact that one of the pages looks like someone (or something) took a bite right out of it. Very upsetting.
4,A little slow,"Volume 6 of Y The Last Man lagged a little bit more than its predecessors. This slow pacing was not as entertaining. Also, this volume kind of went on sub-plots which really didn't add to much to the main story. Not that it was bad or anything, it's just that I could have gone without reading this volume."
3,Meh....,"This, the 6th collection of the Y series, seemed to lack the spark of the previous collections. For fans of the series, and those eagerly waiting for each collections release, i would recommed that you purchase. But be aware that this seems to mark a lull in the Y story. Hopefully it will pick up once again in subsequent releases, as the story comes to a close..."
3,allrightythen,"In volume 5, you could see hints of the story unraveling. Here, it is further evinced. Don't get me wrong, there ARE good parts in here, and not just the 'Girl on Girl' that the title mentions. Some of the plot points are strong, as well as some of the points discussed in a world where all men have died from the plague (except for Yorick) I only wish that the culmination of this story in parts 9 and 10 had been better."
4,Story continues to impres!!,Yorick and his friends continue on their amazing journey now to Japan. The twists in this trade were all remarkable and Vaughan gives new details of this new ost-plague world that I never think of. I love it. I also really enjoyed the flashbacks to Beth's past especially with Yorick. The art was on point as usual. Great stuff!
4,Quite good return,"In my opinion this is quite good ""comeback"" album.Their sound is still very fine.Same quality level than ""Battle Hymn and Turkey""Good purchase. Booklet is normal with lyrics."
4,Has anyone bought this 2 disc package?,John is one of the best singers I have ever heard. When he fronted LRB in '83 I heard John for the first time. His voice has haunted me since.I have tried to buy Johns DVDs but they are all in PAL format. My player wount do PAL. Does anyone know if the DVD in this Whispering Jack offering is NTSC or PAL? I would think the CD would not be a problem. Any input would be appreciated!
3,Good Book,"Good book. Sometimes the kindle interface is not the best. As the staff for the exercise and the play button end up in different pages, so you have to play with font size to get them back on the same page."
4,Not to be overlooked,"Deerhoof are a very prolific band with several stand-out albums. Looking simply at the number of reviews Halfbird is overlooked among Deerhoof's work. While it's true this isn't as consistently splendid, as the others say here, as some of their others, it does contain enough EXCELLENT songs to warrant notice.Their channeled chaos, which is most raw on these earlier recordings, has always delighted me. The volatility is present here, but Halfbird also features my favorite examples of their flair for making uniquely beautiful songs with extremely eerie currents in ""red dragon"" and ""xmas tree"". It is quite gritty, but I think that's a better mentality for their spasms anyway. I agree with Jason. Chew that gristle, it'll do you good."
3,26 letters in the alphabet,"This is a very cute toy. The problem with the educational aspect is that there are only 24 blocks. Although all of the letters exist, you can not demonstrate the alphabet at the in order. I tried to reach the manufacturer, but no one responds."
3,Braxton Played eai Before There was eai,"To correct some serious historical errors floating down here in the review section, one should realize that Braxton entered the electronic foray, or even eai style, as far back as the early 70s. In particular you can hear him exchanging notes with Richard Teitelbaum who was a member of the pioneering electronic group musica elettronica viva. You could also look to music with Derek Bailey or others that also really resemble the style of this recording acousticesque recording. This is a pretty good recording and a step away from Teitelbaum, George Lewis, or Wolf Eyes collaborations. Here he scurries in and out of Braxton style compositions to playful interludes with Bauder. This is certainly a welcome change of direction for Braxton fans though not a stunning one."
1,NASTMom,"I just received my grinder and used it for the first time. I bought it to grind flax seeds. Even on the fine grind half the seeds fall through whole.Added to the fact that it is not grinding the seeds, it takes a lot of time. All the seeds do not go through, and the remaining seeds are hard to get out.In addition, the hole where you put the seeds in is very small. It would have been nice if it was bigger.I am sorry I purchased this item."
2,This is the SEASONING grinder!,"For those who want to use the spice grinder refill inserts, this is NOT the right grinder to buy with it. This is the SEASONING grinder, you want the vase SPICE grinder.Kuhn Rikon Vase Spice Grinder, BlackYes, the page says that this product is the spice grinder. Do not be fooled. Make sure that the product you are buying has the inserts clearly visible in the vase of the grinder. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
2,Kuhn Rikon Vase Grinder - Works great!,Love the design and it works better than any other pepper grinder I have ever owned. I use one for salt too.
3,Good cushion but lousy cover,"I bought this cushion and had a puncture 2 weeks later. The reason is that the cushion cover that comes standard with the cushion has large openings at its 4 corners. Those openings allow sand particles to grind small pinhole leaks into the cushion and then you lose all your air. I complained to Roho and they sent me their expensive Heavy Duty cover for free. That cover has no holes and I have not had any problems since. Every Roho cushion I've ever bought has had this same problem. If Roho cushions came standard with the Heavy Duty covers, than they would dominate the wheelchair cushion industry."
3,Battling bride,"Who was the stranger living in Brianna Scott's apartment? Ahmed ben Rashid claimed to be a foreign diplomat in need of a hiding place. And though Brianna needed Ahmed's generosity to take care of her brother, she wasn't about to play housemaid to some overbearing sheikh!In such close quarters it wasn't long before Brianna discovered Ahmed had the demeanor of a king. Yet the biggest surprise was ""His Majesty's"" demand that she become his bride. But Brianna wasn't walking down the aisle until her royal suitor learned a much needed lesson in love..."
2,Chipped picture frame!,I received the frame chipped at two corners. It was shipped in a huge box without enough padding. I believe the box could have been much smaller or should have fit the frame. Not very happy about this!!!!
2,Seller difficult,"The seller requires accepting a no returns contract but does not provide shipping costs or arrival info. I requested expedited delivery. Immediately after making my purchase, I checked this info, finding that though the product was listed as being in stock, it would not ship until 2 weeks after the date I placed the order.I called the seller within 5 minutes of placing the order and spoke with a woman who repeatedly told me that she could not cancel the order ""at this time."" She could not or would not tell me what ""expedited delivery"" meant. Finally she hung up on me. I called again and got the same runaround until I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor was polite but unhelpful for several minutes. Not until I mentioned taking the issue further did he offer to check into the matter and call me back. The following day I received an e-mail that the item had been shipped by overnight mail.I would not deal with this seller again."
5,beautiful print chosen for babys room,Love this print...the size is true to the spec. Nice quality and looks perfect in my little boys room. Came carefully packed as well !
2,It falls off the wall,"The timer falls off the metal filing cabinet I stuck it to (Magnets you know). I leave for the evening and when I come back the next morning the timer is on the floor but the magnets are still stuck to the filing cabinet. I've already sent one timer back, this is my second one and it is still coming loose from the magnets. I'm trying super glue now because I like the dual timers and the size and color of the item - it just won't stay stuck to the magnets."
3,No Ones Perfect,"""Soul Matters by Yolanda Tonelle Sanders was an enjoyable read and a reminder that you should be true in all your dealings and keep GOD in everything you do. You would think Wendy had it all in her perfect world, finacially stable husband who makes sure she wants for nothing,safe job that she did not need. A family that was strong and loved her.She had always lived her life a christian way. When trouble arises you start wondering how true is her faith,and trust in what she has always belived.While reading ""Soul Matters"" you may want to slap Wendy at times or shake Kevin to get a backbone. But what a refreshing breath to meet a man like Kevin. With her life falling apart and her family lies and secrets coming to light,you start wondering when will Wendy call out for help from the only one she knows would help her."
4,Christians fall but they get up,"Yolonda Tonette Sanders created a story of a family under attack. They were being hit from many different angles and confused about which path to take. In this debut novel she created 3 dimensional characters that the reader sympathizes with, hates, laughs at, loves and applauds. Phenomenal Women Book Club read this book as our August 2008 book of the month and everyone woman in the club could identify someone they knew similar to each of the characters. This is really good read that I recommend to anyone looking for a faith based book."
4,God and Family is all you need to get by...,I am a new fan of Yolonda Sanders after reading this book. it captured me from the first page until the end. She delivers the message in a way that relates to yourself of someone that you know personally. Iwould reccommend this book to anyone to read.
3,Not A Page Turner,"Soul Matter is a story about love,secret and lies. A little slow at times but keep reading it is worth finishing.I look forward to the author's next novel."
3,Soul really does matter,"This was an enjoyable lighthearted read. Even though the book is over 350 pages I finished in a few days.However I felt the book was too long. Alot of things that were told in the story in my opinion could have been left out since they were not essential to the storyline.I also felt the author was too wordy. When a character would react to something she'd explain to the reader what they were reacting to and why instead of allowing her characters actions to speak for themselves.Overall I enjoyed the book. The characters are likeable and seem very much like people I know. I had a cantakerous old Grandmother just like Frances, I wonder what secrets she may have been hiding. *smile*My favorite character was Wendy's husband Kevin. Although he was not saved during most of the book he still acted with integrity."
5,Awesome,"This was one of the best books that I've read this year. I think the author did a very good job with this book and I look forward to reading more from her.This book was such a good read that I finished in 2 days. If it wasn't for the fact that I had to go to work, I would have finished sooner than that.You won't be disappointed."
3,"Sequel of ""The Children of Noisy Village""","Here, those six adorable... kids(Ellen Demerus, Anna Sahlin, Linda Bergstrom, Crispin Dickson Wendenius, Henrik Larsson, Harald Lonnbro) return to tell us more of author Astrid Lindgren's childhood years. Taking up right where The Children of Noisy Village left off, we find our cast heading off to school and lots of vignettes about it as well as of holidays, a blizzard and a first try at babysitting. If you liked the first one, this is bound to be hit."
2,Good Book...Except for the bugs,"I am using this book for a class on Catholic Social Teaching, and it is very useful. By containing the encyclicals, constitutions, and other documents of Catholic Social Teaching along with some commentary and background provided by the authors, it gives great insight into what all Catholics should be focusing on.The bad thing however was that when I received my book in the mail it had tiny black bugs all over it, inside and out. I had to throw it away as I couldn't get rid of the bugs and did not want them in my house.Unfortunately this has made it a little bit difficult given that I need the book for class, however all the documents in the book can be obtained on the Vatican's and the USCCB's website for free. All that you are lacking is the small commentary by the authors of the book for each document, you will still get the text of the Church teaching from the websites and not have to pay anything for it."
4,Exclusively 60s era Bollywood,"If you're looking for songs similar to the Rafi cut on the Ghost World soundtrack, here's a good comp. Though the aforementioned cut is not included, there are a couple songs sung by Rafi that are in the same vein, plus a lot of other cut-n-paste rock/psyche/pop weirdness. This is probably my favorite of the stateside-release Bollywood soundtrack comps I've heard. No overlap with any of the other comps I know of..."
4,'60's Bollywood tracks - wild & wacky,I LOVE this CD - Bollywood in all it's glory. Love the way Rajastan meets Waikiki Beach in one track (I kid you not surf guitars). Wonderful and strange stuff.
2,no interactive contents,"I can't find any interactive table of contents. With a Kindle, I look for ""Kindle"" editions, which one of the main requirements for would be an interactive table of contents. Otherwise, I just have to page through the whole document to go somewhere well into it."
5,Tina Turner Concert in Rio,Just loved it and we are adding it to our Tina Turner Collection. This video shows Tina in her younger days and more on her wild side.
2,Tina Fan,"This was not a good performance nor video. The camera, lighting was inadequate, she nneded backup singers and dancers, sorry."
2,Faded quickly,"This product had an odd textural quality, which doesn't really matter when it comes to a garden flag, but there was no depth to the printing. The product also faded to gray within about 4 months. We live in Dallas, and this occurred during the summer months, but 4 months is an unacceptable life span."
1,Commentaries often offer opinion as indisputable fact,"The book itself is very handsome and well put together. However, this bible is chocked full of commentaries, including many right in the text, which make it very difficult to read. Also, unless you have a very strict fundamentalist background (Pat Robertson is one of the authors of the commentaries) you will quickly become annoyed with the substance of these commentaries, because they present sometimes contorted interpretations of the text as indisputable fact. Only buy this book if you want someone else to do the thinking for you, instead of trying to read and learn the Word for yourself (which is a big mistake, in my opinion)."
5,Helpful Product for Sleep and Possibly Recovery,"I use the zeo sleep monitor and noticed higher deep wave and rem sleep on nights I used this brand ZMA. I'm sure other ZMA supplements will do the same. Of course to each his own but I would definitely suggest experimenting with it.I can't confirm the recovery aspect as I haven't done sufficient experimentation, but I figure the science is there."
3,It's a Vitamin Supplement.,"At three caps, I got a little drowsy, but otherwise didn't help me sleep. Weird dreams, but no nightmares. Buy for a vitamin supplement, nothing else."
3,Slept better but broke out.,"I can't speak to recovery, but I do agree that I slept better and longer while taking ZMA. With that said I also believe it caused me to break out. I'd gone almost a year without any kind of break out, started taking this, a week later I had four spots of new acne. Correlation? Yes. Causation? No...but still suspicious."
1,"helps you fall asleep but awful night sweats, waking up, and crazy dreams",I bought this as I heard it was a useful sleep aid and was looking ti see if any worked better than melatonin (I already knew all other claims about zma for testosterone and everything else it is marketed for were bs). It helps you fall asleep but I was up several times waking up with bad night sweats and crazy dreams. Strangely I do feel rested even after waking up 3-4 times in pools of sweat and having to change shirts but ZMA is a waste of money and not worth taking again. If you want restful sleep buy some 1mg melatonin tablets and cut them in half and take .5mg. Low dose melatonin is shown to be more effective than high doses and is dirt cheap and works better than this anyway.
2,Placebo...,"Definitely a placebo... but hey you need zinc, mag, and pyridoxine... so not completely wrong... So believe in the force and it just might work for you..."
3,Typical ON quality,"As far as this specific brand, ON delivers pretty much what I'd expect, no busted capsules, decent price, and so forth. The actual results from ZMA are a thing on their own, do your research."
1,This is a BALCO scam!,"ZMA was developed by Victor Conte, the man who supplied steroids and HGH to Barry Bonds, Marion Jones, Jason Giambi and many other athletes during the late 90's/early 00's as a placebo to generate income, utilizing many carnival barker tactics. The fact that this rather useless crap is still on the market shocks me.The book ""Game of Shadows"" has more information on this idiotic supplement.IT IS A TOTAL SCAM."
1,No effect!,"I try a lot of different supplements and 9 times out of 10 they do not work, add this one to the list of the does nothing crowd."
5,You'll get a good night of sleep and wake up with wood,"For those who haven't started using this well known supplement, come up to the next level. You'll know it works after about a week. Excellent sleep without grogginess in the morning, and you really will wake up and know it worked to boost Test as well. If your training hard enough, you gotta start using it."
4,Better recovery,I take 3 caps before bed and I have noticed I rest better with a quicker recovery. I really have grown to trust this brand and recommend purchasing this if you are seeking ZMA in general!
2,ehhhhh!!!,"i had this book for almost a month and i never ever put in a bag or mishandled it, then one day i was flipping a page and it just came apart from the binding -_- then 7 more pages after that........."
1,Treat your students to a better text.,"""Trite and boorish"" is what some have referred to this text as (really! I've overheard as much.)Pojman is a one man text book factory, writing general overviews of philosophy in various areas and editing various things. It's a shame that his books have become so popular because he's not very good.Pojman's biases seem obvious and annoying as he openly dismisses certain areas of thought without giving much attention or development to what he's supposed to be covering (such as his treatment of existential phenomenology) which is really bad for an intro textbook.But anyhow, this just isn't very good. Do your classes a favor and assign another book."
4,It's a young adult/teen graphic novel...not for littl'uns!,"This is the first volume of the new young adult novel series based on the best-selling comic book, 10th Muse.In Greek mythology there were 9 Muses, the daughters of Zeus, but history forgot one - The 10th Muse - MUSE OF JUSTICE.

5,Good 1100 mAh Battery for my Olympus E300.,"Pro: Great price, 100% compatible with my E300Cons: None really, unless you absolutely need a 1500 mAhIt's brand new so it works great and hold its charge!I'll update this in a year or 2 to state if it still performs well.It's a Very cheap replacement that works!I would not pay double the price for the 1500mAh, I'd prefer having two 1100 mAhand have one on the charger while I use the other one. I've never drained a full one in a single day, but Irarely use the flash and I don't look at the pictures on the puny LCD of the E300.Update 2011 - The battery still works, but my E-300is not just my ""Backup Camera"" so I will not be able toproperly evaluate the life span of this battery.But it still works great."
