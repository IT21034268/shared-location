5,Tess Gerritsen Does It Again,"I'm an author that writes romantic suspense, and I can tell you that I am never disappointed by Gerristsen. Her characters are well developed, and she keeps me turning the pages. I read for enjoyment and Tess fills the bill. I love the way she has slowly developed her heroine Rizzoli. Each novel gives you a new insight into her character. If you like thrillers, you'll love this one. I keep trying to put out the light, but end up staying awake until the laast page is turned."
4,BODY DOUBLE,I have not read all of it but as usual Tess Gerritsen holds a persons interest and weaves a good story.
3,Another average airport thriller,"This was the first Jane Pezzoli book I read. The plot reminded me a little too much of ""Life Support"", but it was entertaining enough, so I'm going to read the other books in the series as well (fortunately our local library has all of them).SPOILERSI liked the female leads but found it unrealistic how quickly one of them got over the violent death of her budding love interest - in her own car, at that! And it struck me as stupid for the killers to cut the victims open, endangering the babies in the process. Why didn't they just wait until the women had given birth and kill them afterwards? The vivisection made no sense."
3,Another serial killer?,"I think that we're past the point where serial killer books are very interesting unless they're just exceptionally done. BODY DOUBLE is tightly plotted, well thought out and -- when all is said and done -- just OK. Tess Gerritsen is a fine enough writer that she shouldn't have to shock us with a lot of blood and guts and horror yet you can't help but feeling that's what she's doing here.I'm not sorry I took the time to read the book, but I hope future efforts explore newer and more interesting areas. This one just left with me a ""this again?"" sort of feeling."
3,"My first book by her, not great...but I'll read her others based on your reviews","1) Ending was a let down with a plot twist out of left-field2) 2 intriguing villains never really pay off into anything either plot or character-wise3) Domestic dispute sub-plot is very unoriginal4) Fast-paced, easy to readI will read more by this author since other reviewers say this wasn't her best book, but I wouldn't recommend starting with this one."
5,a fabulous quick read,"i read this in 2 and a half days this past winter break. despite its lack of depth (no sybolism, metaphors, etc.--a refreshing break for an ap english student), this book is incredibly gripping! with almost a 'law & order' feel, this book is more suspenseful than most movies i've seen."
5,Lots of suspense,I loved this book and finished it within a few nights of starting it. The characters come to life and Dr. Isles is very likeable. It has a surprise twist at the end which I loved. I never would have guessed how it ended. It is well written and flowed nicely. I never got bored and plan to buy another book by this author today.
3,"Not ""Gravity"", but Ok.","I compare everything she writes with Gravity, and this one fell short. I am not a fan of series with recurring characters, per se. I like her stand alones better."
4,Gruesome and captivating !,"This book is hard to put down, despite it's morbid contents. The scientific aspects of this story are steeped in reality, though grimly lacking in emotion. Yet the human aspect seems heartfelt. I'd say it's worth reading, if you puzzle over the macabre!"
5,"My First ""Tess Gerritsen"" Novel",I'm a Newbie to Tess Gerritsen's Novels... I really like the Rizzoli & Isles Series I've watched 3 of the shows and I LIKED them Alot!!
4,Imai Shines,Imai shines in the Rhapsodie for Viola and Orchestra. She has thought out the phrasing very musically and technically is very secure besides one or two glitches. She could use a better orchestra though. There is more than one spot that the orchestra could give more emphasis to the music. Overall though this is a pretty good recording of the Rhapsodie-Concerto. I reccomend it.
2,"Great art, hopeless verse","I wanted to like this. I really did. But ... I didn't. It's such a brilliant idea and the execution is so disappointing. The art is excellent - wonderfully creepy and Gorey-esque - but the selection of alphabetic entities seems arbitrary at best to anyone with a half-decent familiarity with Lovecraft and the ""poetry"" is hopeless. The little verses show a real tin ear for rhyme and meter, and don't even attempt to stick to a consistent stanza form throughout (in contrast to Gorey, whose little poems were always as beautifully crafted as his drawings). A disappointment."
3,"Good, but not great","I enjoyed this trilogy, but the heroine irritated me at times and her suffering was a bit much for me - not because of the graphic nature so much as that I felt it was more than was necessary for the story to be complete. I was frustrated by the Kris-Dirk-Talia triangle. Although there were grains of truth in the relationships and I cared about the characters, overall I felt this series lacked the depth and insight of The Last Herald-Mage Trilogy. That said, I raced through the books and enjoyed re-reading them. A worthwhile read, but not a must-own."
4,"Good, But not great","This is the third book of Lackey's that I've read. This is about the the hundreth fantasy novel I've read. Although the plot is very sound, and the details are very good, one gets tired of all the horrible things that keep happening. I mean, crushing her feet were a bit much. Still, I finished this book in one night. But for you starters, I would compare Lackey with Tamora Pierce and Lloyd Alexander. Lackey is one of the best authors I have seen."
5,Emotional,The plot was solid and entresting. (Talia & Kris are traveling to Prince Ancar to size him up.) The people (and compantions) are detailed and so ??... deep. I feel live I have known Talia my whole life. I laughted and cryed with her. I could not wait to find out what would happen with Talia and Dirk. I wish the author would do a follow-up book about their lives together or ???apart???. Everyone can escape inside or into a book. Simple statment: Read
4,Talia grows up,"Although these first books in the Valdemar series lack a certain maturity (especially when compared to the Vanyel series or ""Storm Warning"" and ""Storm Rising"") they're still a must-read to truly appreciate the series.Herald Talia has grown up, earned her whites, and faces triumph and tragedy (with much stronger violent content) that may shock younger readers who began with the milder ""Arrow's Fall"" so be warned."
5,amazing,This book was very well written just like all of her others. it draws you in to the magical world of valdemar and you can picture everything.
4,Good Book,I enjoyed this book and the story was a fun read. I have finshed the other two books and have went on to read more of Mercedes Lackey's books. I'm sure her books will keep me buzzy for a while.S.Barnett
3,Hmmm.....,"I compared this pair of hihats to a pair of 13"" Zbt hi hats, and the ZBTs sounded better, but just barely But you ask: WHAAAT? those are z customs! and they're dyno-beats! those are the same hihats Lars Ulrich uses live!Yes well here was my problems with it.Its *too* loud, louder than i thought it would be.Its sounds extremely tinny, didnt like that.Closed hihat sounded wasn't what i thought it would be. For 275 bucks, it wasnt exactly worth it.. Then i compared these to ZHT 14"" rock hats, and the ZHTs sounded much more what i was looking for.So, they're alright hihats, in my opinion, but not beginner or intermediate hihats."
5,great compact guide,reading this guide i found all i wanted to know...and nothing more (which i am glad due to my short attention span). i have read uncommon grounds and a few other coffee books and this has provided a great overview without having to go really in-depth in the subects.
3,Beautiful book but...,"I bought 3 ""Box"" books and they rate the same, for the same reasons.A beautiful book of beautiful projects. But the word Basic is a bit misleading. The author seems to assume everybody has a shop full of professional equipment, access to all kinds of wood species and experience with stains and other techniques. If I had all of that I wouldn't look for a ""basic"" book.That said, the projects spark the imagination and there are useful tips that will find their way into my work. But it may be a long time (if ever) before I can ""do a project"". Or come close. Granted, the picture on the cover should have been a givaway, but you expect the ""best results"" on the cover.Scott"
4,The best of its kind!,"This is what I would expect from a book that used the word ""basics"" in it. I found it to be a great learning resource, as a beginner to creating boxes. Interesting designs, complete patterns, and cut-lists for each project.The only problem with this book is that there are no pictures of the boxes in the process of being built. Beginners could use examples of the various stages. The only other pics, other than the completed boxes, are line drawings. That is the one thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars.All in all...a good book on box making."
1,Publishing Errors,"I had to return this book because it was printed with page out of sequence. I don't know if this was the fault of the author or publisher, regardless it made the book impossible to read. It looked like an interesting book if not for this flaw, and I was sorry to return it.Edited 5-23-08I found another copy of this book at a locale woodworking store and the pages were out of order in that copy also."
1,How to construct unattractive boxes,"This book will show you in detail how to make unimaginative and unattractive boxes. Although the author says he does, I cannot believe he is able to sell his creations at flea markets."
2,Hermies won't eat,I gave it 2 stars cause it came quickly. That's about it though. I have 3 hermit crabs and for the last 3 weeks they will not eat it.
5,K&N for everything!,I'm sold on these reusable air filter products. I will be using them on all of my equipment.I have it on my daily driver and have cleaned and recharged it once. I seemed like new when cleaned.
2,Harmless but timeless,"A harmless romantic movie with a touch of comedy. Nothing really spectacular but catching the flair of the late 70's, beginning 80's in a most delightful way. Watch the clothes, specifically Ricci Martin's white trousers. To be honest, there could have been more of everything, but I doubt if the movie would have been the same again. Anyway, the best is the music by England Dan & John Ford Coley. The soundtrack to the film was their final cooperation. I have been loving this for more than 30 years now. (June 19, 2011)"
1,Title Misleading,"This is a different title for the movie ""Just Tell Me You Love Me"".My Father Loves this movie (latter) and I thought ""Maui"" would be somehow different but they are the same movie.BTW, VHS doesn't hold up very well after 20 years (dispite the seller claiming it was ""Like New"").Nice cover on the box -almost worth the cost of the purchase!"
5,Wonderful book,"This is a must have book. Pamela Miles is an exceptional writer. I was impressed with her knowledge, her eloquent explanations and the amount of subject matter she covered on all areas of Reiki. I've been a Reiki practitioner for almost two years and I learned a lot from this book!"
2,Too much about why Reiki is good and not enough about how to do it,"I was looking for a concise ""how to"" book to learn to perform Reiki on myself and others. This one dwelt too much on why Reiki was useful, and not enough (for my tastes) on learning how to perform it."
5,The BEST Reiki book on the planet!,This Reiki book is hands down the best I have ever read! This is an excellent book for anyone interested in learning more about Reiki or for those who are already practicing. The depth and clarity of the author's understanding and relationship with Reiki is outstanding. Highly recommended! I have been practicing and teaching Reiki for over 10 years.
5,A must have for serious practicioners,"This is a great book. Despite far from being the ultimate Reiki guide or something (I haven't found any so far) it gives a great view and different perspective of Reiki practice.Miles focuses many interesting aspects, which are very important as for clients, as for practicioners, as to regular medical professionals.Enriched with many recent studies in medical area, as well with statements of recognized professionals of ocidental medicine, this books makes Reiki simple as it is, but bringing very interesting information about the practices and concepts related to Reiki.A very grounded reference book, for nowadays practice. Preparing the terrain to consolidate alternative therapies in the hall of official ocidental terapies.I liked very much this book, a must have.Not as technical as some books are, nor balmy as others, but very informational, bringing light to a greater understand of Reiki.Tiago H."
4,a great Reiki reference book for me,I use this as review book. I have had 2 Reiki classes with someone trained by Mrs. Takata.
1,Don't Buy This Book. It's a Rip Off,This book is a rip off.A total disappointment.It's a waste of money to buy a book that tells you that you can't learn Reiki from a book.What a skam.My money would have been better spent on an oil lamp or a bubble machine.I would give it zero stars if I could.
3,Outdated,"When one purchases a book that says on the inside flap that ""This edition first published in 2002,"" one might expect the information to be up to date. The truth is, the book was written in 1997, six years ago, and has not be updated at all. This is important because information about every subject covered (history and politics, economy, society, environment and eco-tourism, and culture) has changed in critical ways since that time.That is not to say, that the book is useless - just not accurate in 2003. What I found annoying is the immediacy of the writing and no indication that you are reading anything but current information. Unless you happen to know that Figueres is no longer president of Costa Rica, you would likely assume the facts and figures presented were correct as of 2002.There have been two Costa Rica presidents elected since the author took fingers to keyboard. Much has changed in Ticoland, but you would never know it from reading this book."
4,I want more!,"Ok, so it is great to finally have some Jesus Lizard live on DVD, and I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD, but... The show from 1994 seems incomplete. There are a few fadeouts during the set, which makes me wonder if some material was left out, or if the order of the concert was rearranged. Second, why not the whole CBGB's show? This DVD does not seem particularly long and they could have fit more material on it. Third, the interview, while entertaining, is embedded in the show, why? It is pretty annoying and probably should have been part of the bonus material. I wouldn't avoid this DVD if you are a Jesus Lizard fan, and the video here is amazing, but a much better job could have been done. In the interview, David Yow mentions that they have hours of live footage, and several music videos, so hopefully more live material will see the light of day soon."
5,Follow Me,"I still remember when Rick and Ron gave me this album on a return visit to NH in 1974. My wife and I tagged along right behind them on a break while they were singing in Portsmouth. They turned and Karen asked them if they ""still did 'Follow Me' because it had become 'our song'?"" They smiled and pulled out their new album of the same name! Gave it to us as a belated wedding present. Nobody ever sang that song better, and their selection on ""the Dutchman"" in the streets of Amsterdam still makes me weep upon hearing it. These guys are the best balladeers."
4,IF YOU NEED IT READ IT! DON'T WAIT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE!,THIS BOOK PROVIDES THE READER WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE OPTIONS THE HOMEOWNER MAY HAVE IN ORDER TO WORK OUT AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THE BANK. THE AUTHOR STATES THAT HE IS A SEASONED BANKER. WHO ELSE WOULD YOU LISTEN TO! I BELIEVE THOSE IN THE THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BOOK AS A GUIDE.
5,Very beautiful,"I've been starting to grow fond of Sibelius's music ever since I bought ""Lemminkainen Suite,"" ""Violin Concerto,"" and ""En Saga."" All of which are from the label BIS. And the pieces from violin and orchestra are also quite dazzling. The ""Humoresques"" sound very relaxing, and it increases your imagination if you're a writer of any sort. ""Serenades"" and ""Two Pieces for Violin and Orchestra"" sound very good, too. ""Ballet Scene"" and ""Overture in E Major"" aren't fillers at all: they are purely memorable music from the greatest Finnish composer of all time. Dong-Suk Kang is a brilliant violinist, and it definitely shows on this CD. Neeme Jarvi and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra are nothing short of amazing.A+"
2,La Piel De Otono,This soap was edited in a boring way. Was not interesting at all. I wasn't focused enough I wanted for the soap to be finish. I had to fast forward it. The only thing that I could enjoyed a bit were the bloopers.
3,Interesting read.,"When I got the book, I could tell it was really old. It took almost two weeks to come and there wasn option for faster delivery. I read this book as part of a book club as I am in the health care field. It was interesting, but not sure it would have been my choice of books to ready."
2,Bad writing,"Interesting content, really poor writing. The whole book had no clear path. Just poorly organized."
2,can you say egomaniac?,"all kidding aside, ""Unnatural Death"" was merely a forum for the author to air his opinions about others in the same field as well as try to exonerate himself from accusations he feels were made without just cause. the cases he chose to profile weren't that interesting & seemed to contain tidbits I didn't need yet lacked information I was hoping to glean. The writer seems to do a lot better a reporting the straight facts - how to ascertain time of death, blood pooling, blood colors, etc. rather than conveying his own experiences. I found ""Dead Men Do Tell Tales"" by William R. Maples to be a more interesting read with historical cases (the Romanov's of Russia, a dead president & a Spanish conquistador) plus Dr. Maples' personality doesn't get in the way of his storytelling."
2,OUTDATED! OUTDATED!! OUTDATED!!!,"This book is well written, but quite outdated. It provides interesting details of cases we've all heard about through the media and includes information on obscure cases, as well. An interesting read, although it could've been longer. It's quite short. It's MUCH better than David Fisher's Hard Evidence, so don't waste your time on that one."
3,interesting but lacking,"This was a very good book, but some parts just skimmed over the subject and other parts didn't need to be that long. The section about Kennedy was very interesting, but the whole book could have just been written about that. He just skimmed over his findings. He pointed out the politics in being a ME and made his feelings very clear about certain people he worked with. This alone made me feel the book wasn't as good as it could have been."
1,"More like ""formless blob"" bundt pan","I bought this in a store, basing my purchase on the picture on the label. The cake on the packaging wasn't baked in this pan -it was baked in the more expensive cast aluminum pan. I find this dishonest, and it was definitely a waste of money."
3,good but not really....,"alot of these bands are good fun to listen to, but...... if they would just leave mike pattons voice alone! they would be more appealing to me anyway....thats all."
4,REALLY GOOD BUT TOO SHORT!,"FLANNA AND THE LAWMANFlanna Kennedy saves Trace Cordell from hanging for a crime he didn't commit. She also points out the real culprit.Eighteen months ago Trace wanted to marry Flanna but she decided to follow her father instead. Not only does she save Trace but also drags him into her feud with a local rancher.Trace demands a night with Flanna before moving on, for the protection of his gun, and loses his heart all over again.Really neat story but much too short. recommended."
4,Our Number Two Maui Guide,"Until Andrew Doughty's ""Maui Revealed"" was released, this Moon handbook was the best you could get. We used it on our first trip to Maui. Like other Moon Handbooks, it is rich in history and background info, but the practical detail can't compare to ""Maui Revealed."" We now use this Moon Handbook mainly as a supplement for historical background -- still useful but not our first source. (Most other Maui guides are superficial rubbish.)"
3,"Good, but Maui Revealed is better","We recently took this book on our weeklong stay in Maui. We spent the first two days almost forgetting about this book, since the Maui Revealed book is so much better with its maps and descriptions.That being said, this is still a very good guidebook. This book gives you a little more history of each of the locations and of the island in general. It is also a good resource for planning the flights, where to stay, etc. I found that I would usually check through MAUI REVEALED before we went out for the day, and during the day, then I would read this book at night to find out more of the history of the locations we visited.If you are only going to buy one book, by Maui Revealed. This book makes a very nice second book for a trip to Maui."
1,Horrible Instruction...,"The video is very poorly made, and the instructors look like fools with the dance moves they use. Complete waste of money. Check out salsa crazy videos or super mario instead."
1,Absolutely terrible!!,"I borrowed this DVD from a friend and am SO glad I did not pay for this! Had this been my first look at Salsa it would have been my last. Marlon has not the least idea how to teach dancing! This DVD almost sucked the joy of dancing out of me. ""Anyone Can Dance Salsa"" is a much better choice!"
2,Let's dance salsa-beginning lesseons,This video starts with assuming that you know the beginner steps. A lousy start. There was only one dvd in the package!
1,WORST VIDEO EVER!,"I can't believe that someone actuallly gave 5 stars for this junk DVD. I actually bought this DVD a couple of years ago. I was so...upset when I started watching it. This guy is actually think that he can teach someone to dance?, what a joke. I would not buy this DVD if I've known, I won't even take it for FREE. I returned the DVD and got my money back. Please don't waste your money on this."
1,A Saturday Night Comedy Sketch!,"Call Saturday Night Live and tell them to watch this DVD! They'll get a kick out of this one!Don't, I repeat don't buy this DVD if you want to learn to dance Salsa. More of a comedy sketch, (although I'm sure it wasn't meant to be), this ""vanity"" production is hilarious. This becomes evident in the poor instruction given by Marlon Silva. What qualifies him as an instructor? Where's the basic step? A legend in his own mind, it becomes clear that he and Susie are having a great time doing what ever it is they are doing but the lesson certainly doesn't help beginners or anyone else! Please don't call this DVD Salsa instruction and save your money for a serious lesson!"
1,Absolutely waste of money!!,"I bought this DVD a while back from Amazon. I was very disappointed with the dvd. It's a joke!,really. He was worse than the beginner dancer. I watched the DVD for about 5 minutes and it made me sick thinking that I paid for this?. I will not accept this if someone give it to me for FREE. If you're serious in learning salsa, the New York Salsa DVD series are very good. Don't waste your money on this one!."
1,Worst salsa video around - why can't I rate it 0?,"I've been dancing Salsa for more than 2 years and had a look at several videos. This video series is so bad that you think it must be a joke, but after a while you start to realize that these guys are serious about it. Susie dances worse than many beginners I've seen, hopping around like she's doing jive. Marlon is more mumbling than dancing, his method in teaching is not having one. His moves are very basic and some look just ridiculous. Actually I'm speechless. If you're so bad it's a crime to let people pay $ for a DVD... At least my friends and I had a good laugh! If you want to get a fabulous instructional video, from beginner to advanced, get the RedHotSalsa series from Ron and Bethana Rosario! This is Salsa!"
3,a little sloppy..,"We thought that it was a little hard to understand because of the strong accent, and the lessons were taught quickly, without much consideration that we were beginners. The steps were shown once, and then he went into the much more advanced way to express them, which made the steps confusing. The tape seemed to focus more on the teachers' ability to dance rather than the teacher's ability to teach. Also, the blue screen in the back made the lines of the dancers fuzzy and distracting. I would consider this ""basic"" instruction more geared for intermediates."
5,Sisterhood of Motherhood,"There are many books about motherhood; this book, however, is remarkably different. I approached this book ready to compare my mothering skills with the women in this book - the old ""how did I do"" syndrome. Those thoughts quickly evaporated as I listened to the voices of these women. Although they are from a variety of backgrounds with different life experiences, this book reinforces for me the kinship of mothers. I read the whole book in one sitting, but have felt compelled to re-read many chapters to learn more about the lives of these real women. This is truly a marvelous book."
4,Great item. Drop in part.,"Replaces the original extractor and allows you to physically ""feel"" the extractor to determine is there is a round in the chamber. Easy to install,drop in part! Now you can upgrade your older Glock to include the ""loaded chamber"" extractor. This part weights only 1oz and it's offered at a good price. I just wish sellers stop claiming that this small part weights 2 pounds in order to charge 8.00 dollars for shipping."
5,A Wonderful Point of View,"This book opened my eyes to see the truth of the children in India. It broke my heart for these children, but I loved hearing the story of Amy's dedication to these children and how she changed thier lives. It encouraged me to see how God worked in the situations that she was in."
2,"Documentary, not a music video","This is a great video to listen to Santana discuss his music and influences, but not to listen to his songs. Songs are spliced together from various concerts over the years and can be very annoying. Talking interupts most songs half way through the track. This is ok to watch once or twice, but not a tape you will wear out watching over and over."
3,"Cool, But Has Glaring Flaws","Viva Santana is an excellant way to view the many different time periods and group members of Santana. The video covers Santana's earlier days in Wood stock and on the Ed Sullivan show, and from those early days the video does a pretty good job of including at least on performance of Santana for every couple of years. The bad thing about this video is that the creators of this video decided to run their interview with Carlos over the music portion, which makes the music a lot harder to hear. (Couldn't they have saved to interview portion for its own little area on the video?) Aside from that glaring flaw, the music on the video is fun to watch, and this video serves as an okay summary of Santana's career."
2,Ruined!,"Whoever edited this abomination should never work with Santana material again. He showed no understanding of the qualities of Santana's appeal. He treated them like they were a pop band, always careful to to show the band singing (never their strong suit) without interruption. Yet whenever the band beef up the instrumental muscle, especially when Carlos himself takes a solo, this is his cue to splice in the interviews with Carlos! Aarrgh! I found myself ignoring Carlos's interesting comments because I was trying to listen to the *music*! For Crissakes!This could have been a great video. If someone with more taste and understanding was to re-edit it, who knows it might still be."
5,My Son's Favorite,"I purchased this among other BTN pasta's during a promotion from Amazon. I needed a product without citric acid and this being organic was a Bonus! The only thing I was a tiny upset about was that only the sauce is organic, not the pasta itself. Besides that VERY happy with this product. My kids love it! And my very PICKY 4 y.o son calls this his favorite! It was hard for me to get him to try it, but once he did he wants it all the time! I like it too, I dont need to really dress it up or anything as others have said. Prefer over Annies Homegrown products."
1,Awful,"Must be my taste buds as other reviews says it's great. I think it is awful but my dog ate it. I do see one review that says mom doctors it up with sour cream. Might improve it. If this is better than Annie's, I would hate to taste Annie's."
4,Love this blender!,This blender is fantastic! The blades stay razor sharp and it's super easy to clean. Makes the best smoothies and I've used it as a food processor many-a-time with great results too.
1,Not like your Mom's Oster,"After having an Oster at my Mom's house, I decided to buy this one.This is not my mom's Oster! I tried making smoothies(Ice,Milk and Fruit)The blades would just spin and I would have to take jar off and shake ingredients for them to blend. I had to do this 4-5 times each time I made a smoothie. I'm now searching for another blender and have heard the 4000 series(beehive) is better so I will try that and leave a review of it."
5,Polar Addition 7,Very neat looking addition to my grandson Ashton's Polar Express train set. Well made and durable. It really looks good in the setup. A must have for the Polar Express train set. You will not be disappointed. Highly recommended.
4,Very sturdy but the corner is rounded,These are a great way to protect the corners of your speakers but the rounded corners make for a tricky fit however they do work.
2,"Good video, poor disk","These Families of the World videos are great, educational tools. However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs. My copy of Puerto Rico families was only played 2x. When I went to clean the disk it cracked down the middle. I looked at the back and the disk quality is that of a burned disk copy, not the professional grade you expect from a DVD purchase."
4,16' Aluminum Flag Pole Kit,"The kit came exactly as advertised, shipping was timely.However a co-worker saw it and said that one of his neighbors had purchased one for their yard and that it could not hold up to constant use. He said that the pole has gone from 16 feet down to less than 10 because it has been bent by the wind and they have had to cut off the bent sections to make the pole straight.Though I have not installed mine yet, taking into consideration my co-workers opinion and my inspection of the product I intend to use it at our lake-house only when we are there on weekends and take it down before we go home. I also will not display ""Old Glory"" during high winds.Look elsewhere for a permanent pole. IMHO"
5,LOVE this album!,I bought this album because I like their new album Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and I love this album. Its a little bit different sound but I wasn't disappointed.
3,Not a personal favorite but cool anyways,"When I heard the description of Phoenix as a synth rock band, I was expecting something along the lines of Simple Kid (which I loved). But what I got was something leaning a little more to the pop/hip hop feel. The track ""Run Run Run"" is my favorite on the album because of its down-to-earth instruments. It eases up on the electronics on that track. The rest of the album however is a little top heavy on the electronics making the sound like pop or hip hop. Kinda turned me off but I got used to it and overall enjoyed the album. Not a bad listen but not an excellent one either."
5,Comparing Phoenix,"Postal Service? Not a bit. Alphabetical was like having a smoke after a long day. It just makes you feel good. An aquaintance used to argue with me till red in the face that Muse and Radiohead sound the same. Not even in the same category. My poor guy remark of the day is, if your reading Abercrombie & Fitch for musical opinions, or anything for that matter, you are heading down a tiresome road."
4,It Works,As if Postal Service were the be and end all of synth-pop et al. Ha. This CD has music in it as many recordings of the day do not. To wit: there are a number of connections to Hall and Oates going 'round. Applicable and appropriate. Sometimes we don't either buy or make records to be uber cool but only to make music that reasonates. And this does. If you like hooks in your popular music (which this is) buy it. And also purchase both Quiet is the New Loud and Riot on an Empty Street by Kings of Convenience.
2,"...still waiting for them to sing ""I like girls who wear Abercrombie and Fitch""","Yes, it's mellow, yes it's easily accessible.Yes, these French boys know their electronica.Yes, I can see how people can compare it to Postal Service.No, that doesn't make it good.The thing this album is missing is that elusive, intangible ""edge""Ben Gibbard's voice provides the edge for Postal Service, the little tang to help you swallow the sweet.This is pure fluff, nothing more. Lyrically it's worthless. That's okay if the music can stand alone, but it can't. These guys' voices are so sickly sweet and overproduced, I couldn't see them anywhere else but on American R&B; radio. They need to provide the tang but they are only more sugar. Too much sugar makes you sick. And sleepy.If you want some nice nap music, some background for a coffee shop or an elevator, you've found your band. Sign em up.If you want to be able to differentiate any one song from the last ten you heard, don't buy this album."
1,Totally lame,"I bought this album based on the glowing reviews on Amazon and boy am I disappointed. Music lacks originality, lyrics are trite. Would have given it 0 stars if that rating had been available."
1,Suck-O Rambling Boredom,"This film has no narrative, and just kind of rambles on. Points are made here and there, but few are made. The 'everyone is accepted here' is beat over your head for a majority the film, cheating time that could be spent on other aspects of Rocky. When the film is over they just kind of put a tag on it and call it quits.Shots in the film can go on much longer than need be, adding to the rambling feel of the video.Plus, they keep including interviews with two African-American guys who clearly know nothing about Rocky. Because the two people in questions have very stereotype voices, clothing and body language, it really comes off as racist. To focus that much screen time that adds no valuable information or content to the film, but simply seems to perpetuate stereotypes seems to really work against the 'open minded' theme of the piece."
1,I love rocky but this was awful!,"OK first off the animorphic 16:9 displayed in 4:3 was a pain in the neck, this dvd looks like someone did it on their home PC and then released it to the world, the menu is awful, words are cut off in text that appears on the screen, although i have been a major part of Rocky for over 15 years i would not recommend this to anyone!"
2,Confusing,"As a ""newbie"" to FCP and NLE, I have found this book to be confusing. I usually don't find a clear and understandable answer to my question or problem, and I have to go elsewhere."
1,Do not get this book,This book just lables buttons and does not explain how to set up and use final cut pro 3. the trouble shooting section is a joke. Don't waste your money I found more useful information on the free discussion board at apple.com
5,One of my most valued cookbooks,"This book is EXCELLENT. Every recipe I have tried has turned out not just good, but great. I haven't tried every recipe, but from what I have baked, it seems to be a reliable source. I graduated from Johnson & Wales University with an AAS in Baking & Pastry Arts. This cookbook is one I turn to again and again for great-tasting and beautiful cakes. I look forward to trying them all. The ""chocolate fudge cake"" on p. 62 is my favorite: moist, rich, and everything a chocolate cake should be. Highly recommended."
1,HORRIBLE,"okay, so, you think the recipes are awesome....well they are NOT. I have made the boston cream pie as well as the chocolate cake...and they both turned out horrible. It can't be just me, because we followed the directions completely.Please please please, reconsider buying this book; it will make you look like a disgrace to all of your cooking friends!In conclusion, horrible horrible horrible and don't buy this, unless you hate yourself and want to eat horrible cake."
5,Great music,"I love this music. I'm glad I could still buy it. I heard a selection on a television music channel, and wanted to buy the entire album."
4,EPIC,"Some people say the Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels is the best main event in Wrestle Mania history. Some other people like me, would argue that Hulk Hogan vs. Ultimate Warrior is a close second or number 1! This is this biggest epic in WWF history no doubt about it. The clash of the titans. Hulk Hogan the WWF champion. Ultimate Warrior the WWF Intercontinental champion. Battling eachother in the ring at Wrestle Mania! How can anything get bigger. If you are still a hulkamaniac or you love the Ultimate Warrior than I suggest you buy this now! Another good match is Dusty Rodes and the late Sapphire vs. Macho Man and Sensational Sharri. The reason I only gave it 4 stars because all the other matches were boring and aren't worth mentioning. Clash of the titans! This will go down as one of the best Wrestle Manias in history for sure!"
4,The Ultimate Video,"This was one of my favorite wrestlemanias of all time. It took place at the Sky Dome in Toronto with the best main event of all time, Ultimate Warrior VS Hulk Hogan, and to top that it off it was also title for title which means who ever wins gets both the Intercontential and World Heavyweight Championships. I wont till you the end but I will say it has a surprise ending."
3,"good, but not best","This is a good wrestlemania, and the hogan vs. warrior was okay, but liked 3,7,8 better."
4,A Wrestlmania which Only 2 matches stand out!,"Like Wrestlmania 5, the storylines for the undercard were not as built up as the main event was, with the excption of Jake RobertsVs.Ted Dibase. But what can you say.......WarriorVs.Hogan was unreal, so if you havnt seen it please do it is well worth the money. People seem to forget that this was the last Wrestling appearence for the late great Andre The giant,Which also makes it memerable. It was unreal. The undercard was the complaint."
4,The greatest Wrestlemainia main event ever!,Wrestlemainia 6 can only be summed up in two words:Warrior Hogan. It was the most thrilling match ever. For close to a half hour two of the greatest superstars in wwf history went at it. In the end there was an outcome nobody expected at the time as the Ultimate Warrior beat Hulk Hogan for the wwf title. The rest of the card is mostly forgetable but this Wrestlemainia broke new ground in a lot of ways. This was the first time in wwf history two fan favorates did battle. This event also had the first ever mixed tag match as well as being the first ever wwf event held outside the United States. Buy it!
4,Ultimate Challenge Indeed,WM6 houses the best mian event of the first 17 WM. Hogan vs. Warrior. Champion vs. Champion. Though; my favorite wrestler of all time falls this time; it is still a match for the ages. The undercard is a little lacking which is why it lost a star; but still isn't too bad. A must buy if only for the main event.
5,THE BEST WORLD CHAPIONSHIP MATCH EVERY IN WM6,"WRESTLEMANIA 6 in awesome wrestlemania but it did not have a lot of good match's but the wwf chapionship match relly help it it was the ultimate warrior vs holk hogen one of the best wwf match's ever warrior was the { IC CHAPION} and holk hogen was the { WORLD CHAPION} who wins this ultmate match im not going to tell because i don't want to spoill the fun, WM6 is a must buy for any wrestling fan."
2,dissapointing,"i borrowed this show from the library today and i gotta tell you it is bad. the only good match was hulk hogan vs ultimate warrior. it saved the whole ppv from being a 0 star event.anyway, if you are a new fan like me, i recommend you WrestleMania 19 or 15 but not 6. 8 and 10 and 13 were better."
2,ok bad bad bad bad,1st off hogan vs warrior worst wm main event of all time hell brock vs goldburg was better then this trash just shows u how bad they are.do not buy this tape.hogan vs andre was a better match then this.
2,"They're getting old, or maybe it's I'm getting old","Not that I was expecting anything spectacular, but generally nothing to write home about, nor to spend time watching again. The newer songs didn't impress me like the old songs did when I first heard them many years ago. In hindsight I would have been better off leaving my 'Lake' experience to be an Audio only with my old CDs."
3,Who knew coconut was an aphrodisiac?,"Whoop, turned the page and found out that Adam lied - it's not an aphrodisiac. Sizzle is okay for a beach read but it's not really up to Lori Foster's normal standards. Body Heat didn't even make me laugh which is unusual for a Foster story.I like how Ally uses Hans in Slow Burn. I thought the idea of closing down an entire resort, except of one guest, was a bit much. I was so overwhelmed by the bad business decision that I kind of lost track of the story line. I kept thinking, wow, that's going to cost him, especially when he explained how he got the money. If you can divorce yourself from that factor it's a nice little romance."
3,The format didn't suit me...,"Not to detract from the talent of the authors, but the format of the 2 books crammed into the 215 +/- pages didn't suit me. I'm used to a more involved story and these two were so compact that they didn't quite do it for me. They didn't have much in the way of secondary characters to flush out the quirks, foibles and tolerances of the main characters. Also, they seemed rushed - like the authors didn't have room to add in a moment when all seems lost and the two (four) main characters have to decide to change themselves in the name of love.I would have preferred to see the stories as full length, because they were good stories. But the format shortchanged the works and left me wanting."
4,Kill Me Later,"This movie uses unusual characters, great photographic techniques, and interesting situations to add a lot of life to a well-worn plot. Selma Blair plays the depressed, suicidal, discarded mistress. Max Beesley plays the unlucky thief who gets no breaks. They are pursued by a couple of bored cops who come with baggage. They are surrounded by characters like the sleazy, conniving bank manager, the unlucky-in-love, dim-witted driver, and the loser life-time crook. Sometimes, the most unlikely plans work out!"
4,Stylized reality with heart...,"Interesting movie...Technical: intriguing direction and cinematography...well-done acting by the principles of the film. The concept was treated well, and a full-length movie based on a short film was fleshed out with good twists and turns.Artistry: the characters felt real, especially Shawn Halloway (Selma Blair was wonderful in this role, she felt like a genuine person, despite the seeming ""one-track"" bias). The story was an interesting take on the boy-meets-girl archetype.This film is good entertainment, and one that will appeal to the romantic at heart. It is billed as ""comedy"", and the comedy is found in the hard but light-hearted treatment of several somber themes. Touching, romantic and fun. Let yourself laugh at the depressing things in life!"
3,"Starts off promising, ends tragically","Welcome to a day in the life of Shawn: a young, depressed, cynical and openly suicidal woman whose life seems all but going down the toilet at lightning speed. The basic grasp of the movie is, we're taken through a timeline of events that happen on the day Shawn decides to die. There are a lot of good flashbacks showing exactly what's going on in her mind, intriguing use of slow motion and speed, and of course, sharp, witty humour. However, with all the dramatic footage to keep your eyes glued to the tv, unfortunately the director takes a horrible turn and the movie just becomes another lame stunt of trying to tell people that their Romeo will come along when you least expect it and they will save you. The movie is both a thriller and soppy romance. It's sad a movie that could have been so deep and meaningful had to turn out this way. But what movie doesn't? Worth watching, but keep your expectations low."
3,Good... but sticky,The movie played well which is most important. But when it arrived the case was sticky and so was the dvd.
3,Heaven Help Us,"...if Selma Blair continues to get lead parts. Okay I could barely stand her in "" Cruel Intentions "". Since then she's only done B movies that you haven't heard of ( such as this ). The plot was pretty good and the lead man ( I forgot his name ) was hot and good in his part. Selma Blair is what makes this film simply stupid. She talks as if a spoon is forcing her mouth shut. It is terribly disheartening to watch a movie with a lead who won't even open her mouth to talk. She is the most annoying actress since Patricia Arquette ( and that's pretty bad ). If I don't see Selma Blair in anything but a toothpaste commercial during the next year I won't be surprised."
4,Very Cool,"This movie must of had a good writer/caster and a poor director. The story and acting is excellent, but the horrible cheesy photoshop-like effects need to go. It looks like a good movie that ran out of money, but definately worth a watch. Great for people sick of watching aimless happy go lucky hollywood ""blockbusters,"" this is something that belongs on IFC."
4,Good Plot and Good Acting,"I saw this movie on TV and I really enjoyed it, so much in fact that I bought it. The actors did a great job and played believable roles. There is some dark humor and funny lines. The plot was good and not something seen very often in main screen movies today.The only bad part of the movie was the editing. The director used weird colors for small snippets, which in my opinion did not help emphasize anything, there were also weird zooms and other odd editing.Overall though I liked the movie and it is something I can watch again and again. I recommend it.."
4,A good solid read,"John Lucarotti enjoys history and it shows. One of the sadly destroyed Doctor Who stories. The Massacre is the story of the The De Medici Massacre of the Huguenots on St Bartholomew's Day. It is also the story of the Doctor's involvement and his inability to do any thing to prevent it. History must not be changed. As such, it is a tragic tale all around. Lucarotti tells it well. The writing is solid with just enough description and character shadings to bring things to life. As the reader can use his or her imagination, Lucarotti also has a bigger budget than the show ever did and the Paris of 1572 comes to life. As should be the case with a historical story, the reader will come away with much knowledge of the events leading up to the Massacre, the politics and the personages involved and, while ultimatly sad, it is still a rousing adventure filled with suspense and intrique. And, as I've remarked in another review, Steven Taylor was a great companion. A good solid read."
4,Very romantic,"I found this book romantically satisfying, and the characters fairly well fleshed out and believable. The only aspect I felt a little hard to believe was the speed by which Falcon Hawk and Maggie developed a relationship. One day her husband was dead, and the next she was in love with this handsome Indian chief. Granted, she had never truly been 'in' love with her husband, therefore she didn't feel that kind of remorse, but it felt sort of wrong with how quickly she went from one to the other. Falcon Hawk certainly is one of Ms. Edward's more charitable and generous characters, willing from the beginning to take in Maggie's unborn child and raise as his own, even accepting Maggie having lied to him about the child's existence! I believed in their love from the beginning, so I would recommend this to anyone who loves to believe in love at first sight, if they don't mind the speed of the relationship!"
2,Caveat Eptor - Buyer Beware,"If you are expecting 6 pair of inexpensive sticks like the picture shows, this is NOT what you want. The picture is VERY DECEPTIVE. You will only get one pair of OK sticks. Shame, shame, shame. There are better sticks for less elsewhere and you would get what you thought you were paying for. Not the case here.Very disappointed!"
5,A must-have for a cook and crafter!,"This book is not only packed full of excellent recipes for gift-giving, but the unique presentation ideas are excellent. They're easy to follow and I've used several. I've added this book to my library with others I have in this series from Leisure Arts. If you love to cook and/or make simple crafts, I recommend it. You won't be able to put it down!"
5,excellent book,This is one of the best crafts books ive ever seen.it has been put together so well.It is a purchase that you'll be happy you've made. You will not regret it.
2,Not worth the time,"As a fan of both golf and films based in biography, I expected to thoroughly enjoy this film. Unfortuneately, it was, on the whole, a let down. Part of it was the casting... with Jim Caviezel in an awful dye-job that was a constant reminder he was just playing a part, his appearance and his acting did not begin to enbody the man I have studied thru books, internet, and documentaries. Part of it was also the script that lacked engaging dialouge. With the exception of Jeremy Northam as Walter Hagan (the one bright spot in the movie), the characters were two-dimentional and forgetable. My advice... if you want a good golf movie with true story backround, skip ""Bobby Jones"" and see ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" It outsines it by a mile."
5,A Good Old Fashioned Flick,"I loved this movie. Jim Caviezel did it again. I guess it made more of a homerun with me because he had a slow debilitating disease, so I could relate to it perfectly. But aside from that, I think he hit on the true person of who Bobby Jones really was - a genuine, good person who gave his best to himself, the game, and his fans. Despite his degenerative health, he gave his life to his family, both immediate and married families. He pursued what he loved with every ounce of passion and decidedly chose the path of being an amateur instead of a professional. I loved the resilience he portrayed despite any misgivings he may have had during the course of his life. I wish I were more like that. This is a great film - watch it!"
5,terrific,"Really enjoyed this movie, arrived in good shape, shipped quicker than I expected. So worth it the purchase. Good job"
4,Interesting person in golf's history,As a golf enthusiast I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it for any golfer 18 and older. I feel like the movie was a wonderful portrayal of one of golf's most formitable players and learned a little history in the process.
4,Bobby Jones - King of the swing (golf that is!),"This movie is very entertaining to watch, but some of the cussing could have been left out. Caviezel's subtle portrayal of Bobby Jones and the good supporting cast with wonderful scenery ends up to give a positive message in this movie.This really shows how things were back then. My dad loved the game, was a scratch golfer, and played his whole life. He related some of these things to me as I grew up playing with him on many a weekday."
5,Great golf movie,I love golf and almost any movie about it. This is a great story about a great golfer that never made a nickel playing and yet was as good for his time as any golfer today.
4,"bobby jones, stoke of a genius",Great movie about golf. Just wish the language would have been cleaner.
3,Historically Accurate,"Over the years I have researched Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.This film is historically accurate. Great job on early life of Bob Jones. However, the casting could have been better for Jones and Hagen in this film.The cast members playing Bob Jones and Walter Hagen in The Legend of Bagger Vance was more believeable, including their swings and demeanors.Overall good -- just need to swap actors playing Jones and Hagen in The Legend of Bagger Vance for the film to be outstanding."
1,Have Not Received my Purchase From MovieMars!!,"BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING FROM MOVIEMARS! I ordered 2 DVD' from them over a month and a half ago, and they claim it was shipped but has been LOST in the mail. They said they would re-ship at no extra cost, but that was over a week ago, and I have not heard from them since. Eric J."
1,Trash and Garbage! Too much swearing.....,"Not a PG! Trashed it! Yes I threw it in the garbage. I bought this because it was rated PG and boy was I deceived because it was more like R with constant swearing, cursing and bad language. From the time he was a little boy he cursed and used the S... word in every sentence. Who wants to watch a family movie with a rude and fawl mouthed kid. I'm glad I only spent $5 because it's not worth my time and money."
2,leaves you hanging,"Sports and movies - should be a PERFECT combination. Especially a story of a true sportsman, a true gentleman of the game, someone who loved to play the game for the game itself.But this movie doesn't spend enough time telling us about the real Bobby Jones. It leaves us hanging and wondering. There is one point where he is playing with a woman golfer and she is refered to as his girlfriend - WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? At another point, he is in the hospital, temporarily banned from the game. Then flip to him writing a letter of apology, then flip to him playing golf. Well what happened to the hospital stay? What happened to his ailment? How did he get better, is it a long time/term disability? Later, he and his wife are arguing over him going to another tournament and then PRESTO there they both are at the match.Scenery - beautiful. Story - while interesting it leaves viewer disappointed. It should just be, could just be so much more."
3,TEE TIME,"BOBBY JONES STROKE OF GENIUS is a reverential exploration of a great figure in the sport of golf. Jones fought a debilitating spinal disease to become the greatest amateur golfer of our time. He is the only golfer in history to win the grand slam. Director Rowdy Herrington shows a respect for the game and he does his best to canonize Jones. Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ, Frequency) embodies the role well, although at times he seems so unhappy it's hard to feel joy with him when it does occur. Claire Forlani lends good support as his supportive wife; Malcolm McDowell plays the rare good guy as Jones's sportswriting friend; and Jeremy Northam brings a good amount of egoism to his role as rival Walter Hagen. The movie so sanitized, however, it doesn't really capture the drive and torment of Jones so much as to elevate his genius. (He also got two degrees and finished law school during all this). It's an admirable movie, but not a truly engaging one."
4,Finally On CD,"I've waited a long to to see FP's Capitol output on cd. This cd sounds good. Now, may we get her others from both Capitol and ABC records released on cd."
5,Two distinctive Scriabin compositions,"Alexander Scriabin composed music in two genres - piano and orchestral. He was himself a prodigy pianist but he composed only one piano concerto and it is a lovely work in the key of f sharp minor. It has the same sort of long melodic lines of the piano concerto by one of his teachers, Anton Arensky. The soloist on this BIS recording is Roland Pöntinen. This was Scriabin's first truly orchestral work, composed in 1896 when Scriabin was 24. There were several other lovely orchestral works to follow, of which the Symphony No.3 or `Divine Poem', completed in 1904, was the last to be given the title `symphony'. Scriabin was to write two more orchestral `tone poems' in the same rich, sensuous orchestral style - the `Poem of Ecstasy' and the `Poem of Fire'. If you enjoy the better-known rich orchestral style of, say, Richard Strauss, you will enjoy these works. The orchestra is the Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Leif Segerstam."
2,Doesn't work for me.,"I don't seem to be any smarter as a result of taking this product. Bummer! I was really expecting to become a genius just by taking a few pills, but alas it's not to be. Maybe I should spend my hard earned money on a visit to a fortune teller. I've heard they will promise to tell you the winning MegaMillion lottery numbers for a few sheckles. Besides I'm tired of taking pills for no reason."
3,Turmeric,"I have arthritic pain and I'm not certain if this works or not. I seem little better but I was also trying coconut oil at the same time. I think everybody has to try for themself. It is cheap, so give a try.I still think the tumeric spice I bought at grocery store (I ate 2 teaspoons) work better. But the result are only shortlive for me."
4,tumeric,I found this to be helpful for pain I was having in my left hip occasionally. I dont know if it is my imagination or if it really helps but I will keep trying it for now
3,I'M DISAPPOINTED,"TAKEN THIS PILL FOR 3 +- MONTHS. FELT NO DIFFERENCE, HOWEVER MY WIFE NOTICED MY BREATH WAS A BIT FOWL WHICH OCCURRED DIRECTLY AFTER TAKEN THE SUPPLEMENT AT NIGHT AND BRUSHED MY TEETH AS WELL.MOST HEALTH SITES DISCUSS THE BENEFITS OF TUMERIC, I MUST BE MISSING SOMETHING"
3,Didn't Work for Acne but Beneficial Otherwise,"I read about turmeric for acne on a couple of skin care message boards. At first, it helped, but it stopped clearing my skin after a couple of weeks. Turmeric is great for the immune system and brain, so it is still worth taking.You can buy this in bulk at Indian grocery stores for far less and mix a teaspoon with a glass of water to drink nightly (warning: it tastes awful this way) or just add it to your food."
5,Clearly a beautiful crystal bracelet.,"A beautiful clear crystal bracelet, although the stones are kinda' small. It would be perfect for a little girl!"
4,Kickboxing made simple!,"This book is great! It shows you the general basics of the steps. It shows you motion by motion how you should move your feet and arms. Also there is a section about exercise and training. It explains everything really well. I think I was looking for a more ""Tae-Bo"" kind of work out. You have to put your own steps to music with this book, which is fine. It is fun and if you are interested in Kick Boxing I would say go for it!"
1,Sue,"I have been using the PCA SKIN pHaze13 for about 3 weeks now, it does not seem to have any improvements on my problem areas. I will give it a few more weeks."
4,It seems to already be working,"I have only been using it for a couple of weeks now. So far I've been told by 2 good friends that my skin looks better and more even, so it must be working. I will continue using this product hoping for the best results."
4,it's just alcohol,"It is alcohol and basically just ends up peeling the top layer of skin off. But so far it is doing what I want it to, which is to make my dark spots less so."
5,Does really well for me,"I've been using this gel for 2 years. I have a very sensitive oily skin with monthly brakeouts. Before this, I was using retin-a micro. My friend who used to own a spa, switched me to this gel and it keeps my skin clear of blackheads and sun spots not any worse than retin-a. The price is much better. I really like it, but every one's skin is different... I think it also helps with fine lines (at least in my case), because it's all I've been using now. Don't do any moisturizers since they tend to make my skin even more oily. I think it needs to be used for more than few weeks to see the results. Same like retin-a - it starts working after few month."
3,"mediocre writing, nifty dolls","It's mentioned in the ""About the Author"" section that Terri Windling is a five-time winner of the World Fantasy Award.. but what they don't tell you is that she won the award for her *editing*, not her writing. And while her writing here is certainly capable, it's nothing particularly special. A little too precious for my taste, in fact. The doll-work of Wendy Froud is what makes the book a keeper."
4,beautiful effort,"As always with this trio, Culture continues to deliver the goods on this no holds barred exposition of their deep roots and message style of reggae.Their harmonies have slipped a tad over the last 20 years, but that matters little when hearing them in all their glory, belting out the truth on titles like the beautiful ""Humble African,"" ""Going Home,"" ""Never Give Up,"" and my favorite track on the cd, the biting ""Nah Stay Inna Babylon.""Another excellent cd by one of roots reggae's most gifted groups."
3,Memory Jog,"I saw Head East & Black Oak in concert together in Minot, ND in the late 70's. A terrible snow storm restricted many fans from making it to the concert, limiting the attendance to only a few hundred people. Both bands were spectacular! It was my first concert, and the small audience size made it that much better. This intimate setting, while laid back, didn't hinder the bands one bit. They seemed to enjoy the freedom and rocked harder than ever.Not all the songs on this two-album set are great, but they're solid reminders of a group of blue-collar, hard working, dedicated musicians. They would've played for free if just given the chance to be heard. The Gettin Lucky album is worth 3 stars, but the Head East album is a solid 4 stars. If you like 70's bands like Journey, REO Speedwagon, & BTO, this album will fit the bill. However, if you only want one Head East album, then get ""Flat as a Pancake.""Now if I could just find a CD of Black Oak (no Arkansas) my 70's fix would be complete."
5,Head East/Gettin' Lucky,If your a Head East fan then most definitely purchase this CD. Their music is still the standard for the Mid-West sound.
5,Awesome and Beautiful,"I first saw Blue Planet on the Discovery channel... years ago and I absolutely fell in love with it. It is one of the most beautifully filmed documentaries and I think only Planet Earth (ironically) surpasses it in that beauty. I have also always loved David Attenborough, who has a way of really bringing the majesty of whatever you are watching into your home. This series is educational and beautiful to the point of tears. This is a must for any DVD library and I would highly recommend Planet Earth as well."
5,The Blue Planet - Seas of Life Collector's Set (parts 1-4),"Besides being born and living on an island in the middle of the Atlanic, I had the luck of experimenting some of the innermost limits of the Ocean. Being the Earth the Blue Planet and the Oceans the less known part of it, this DVD box, for its didactic contents, and good footage and beauty, should be part of every school library and considered a good teaching tool."
4,Blue Planet,"The content is excellent, the photography beautiful. Unfortunately, it does not have English subtitles for the hearing impaired, which would have made it more enjoyable for my husband. Would I purchase it again? Definitely."
5,Great Viewing Experience,"The Blue Planet is a wonderful series of DVDs on the wonders found in the sea. I have viewed it several times and have enjoyed it each time. In showing the video to others, I always get very positive comments. Well worth the price!"
3,Blue Planet,I would recommend this set for kids and adults. I am 76 years old and enjoyed it tremendously. It was terrific.
4,Another quality production,Blue Planet is another excellent production from BBC. My only complaint is that if you have ever seen Planet Earth some of the content in Blue Planet might seem a bit repetitive. Overall not many nature programs can compare to the overall wow factor that these BBc films give.
2,disappointment,"I always like watching nature videos but the quality of this dvd was very poor. So far I am only on the first disc, and only the first half worked(which was great). The Frozen Waters part wont even show the video and the only thing that happens is broken audio. There is not even a scratch on the disc. I would return it but I am stationed overseas in the military. I was really looking forward to watching these, to help pass the time. Now I am just left disappointed. Hopefully the other discs are not as bad."
4,Another winner from BBC,"If you like Planet Earth, you will enjoy these. They are a little too long in my opinion, thus 4 stars."
3,Too much anthropomorphizing of animals,"Visually, this series is spectacular, and don't get me wrong, I could watch it over and over and over again, and I have.I have one issue with the series: The tone of the script gives the animals people like qualities that they have not been proven to have in any kind of scientific way. It also shows a clear bias for or against several animals based on behavior that is scientifically neither malicious nor benevolent. For instance, there are several scenes that feature killer whales on the hunt. Rather than speak of their extraordinary hunting abilities, the writers zeroed in on the more ghastly side of their hunting, and used words like ""cruel"", ""toying"", and ""savage"". They refer to the prey at one point as ""the little fish"" as if we are supposed to say, ""Awww."" This anthropomorphizing of the animal kingdom is unscientific and unbalanced.Evenso, the set is rich with discovery, absolutely beautiful, and will inspire the curiosity of anyone who watches it."
4,"Great series - just no ""The Life Of Birds""","Stunning visuals, great narration by David Attenborough (as always), and unbelievable marine technology give us a great insight into just some of the wonders of the great oceans that surround us. This is a great all-around series, but not as highly recommended as ""The Life Of Birds"" which so far is my favorite series by Sir David."
5,Outsanding!!!,"We've have just about received the Blue Planet DVD and cannot tell you how incredible it is. When viewed on a large screen Plasma with the entire sound system (and subwoofer) switched on ,it feels like you're right there. The photography is outstanding and Attenborough as always ( I have been hearing that familiar voice since school) is just perfect. The quality of the photography as well as the content is actually way beyond what I had expected. All in all , this DVD is something I think we'll watch many more times. Highly recommended!!"
5,Planet Earth,"I really like to watch Planet Earth videos. When I was looking for the CDs of the Planet Earth, I found them on amazon.com with a good price. Although I purchased the used CDs, they are so quality. I strongly recommend these CDs to anyone who likes watching spectacular view of natural things."
3,Could have been excellent... but badly flawed,"The information and narration in this set is excellent, as always for an Attenborough project. However, the presentation is badly flawed by excessive use of incredibly annoying sound effects. We are continually bombarded with swoops, honks, cunches, explosions, bleeps, whistles, and every other kind of sound imaginable. It is unnecessary and distracting. This DVD set should really have an option to turn off the stupid noises.Also, although the material is wonderful, there is a lot of repetition. There were several near-identical sequences of predators attacking a shoal of fish, and we lost count of the number of times we heard the phrases ""rich nutrient soup"" and ""feeding frenzy"".Still, there's nothing to compare to an Attenborough series. I just wish I could give this one the five stars it deserves."
2,Reasons to buy or not,"If you are looking for a gorgeous piece of visual art, this is for you. Otherwise, consider these caveats:1. Not all information is correct. For example, the verbal descriptions of characteristics and habits ascribed to yellow-fin tuna are actually those of blue-fin tuna. Another error is the statement that all corals live in tropical waters when, for example, some of the most beautiful coral in the world is off Alaska's coast.2. The gratuitous accent on predation panders to the worst side of us. It gives violence a veneer of acceptability while ignoring predation's benefits, such as strengthening of species and eliminatin of injured or sick individuals. In The Blue Planet, we can be voyeurs to terror and suffering and let our consciences off the hook by claiming ""science."" In reality, the proportions of this set of DVDs devoted to hunting and killing as compared to other aspects of marine life are way out of whack."
3,Well done but...,"Blue Planet is full of amazing camera work and pictures, I'd expect nothing less from the BBC. However, I couldn't help but feel that a lot fo what i was seeing was left over from Planet Earth, another BBC nature series, and simply stretched out to make it all Oceans. I know the science is sound, the Ocean is large enough to hold this info but I could only watch so many different fish swim in so many different ways. I do recommend it if you are interested in the Ocean, it is an invaluable source of information, but if you're more into the general scene, pick up Planet Earth."
3,check your disc,"fantastic series. however, 2 copies had a problem with disc 1. episode 2 would not play. when examined under the light, a blemish can be seen in the disc etching. Obviously a bad batch, needs to be recalled."
4,Wait for Special Edition!,"This DVD just great. But better wait for the Special Edition. The Special Edition has three more new episodes (The Abyss, Dive To Shark Volcano & Amazon Abyss). Or you can purchase it as DVD Region 2 from amazon.co.uk as I do."
5,Incredible!,This is one to watch over and over again and can enjoy with your family. You will be captivated by this and anyone watching this with you will be captivated as well. I highly recommend this.
5,The Whole Family Loved it,"This was one of the only thing our ""turning 15"" year old wanted for his birthday. He received the Planet Earth series for Christmas. Blue Planet had spectacular footage. The filming was incredible. Everything was so vivid. You actually felt like you were viewing things first hand. It was amazing to watch, and although it is educational, it felt more like going to the movies."
5,Awe-inspiring,"I have watched ""Blue Planet"" four times over the years, and I every time I am left in my couch mentally gawping at the sheer magnificence, in the largest and truest sense of the word, of this series. The imagery is truly awe-inspiring (not the teenage 'awesome dude', but the fear of God and Hell kind of awe), and is in itself well worth the price of this DVD 5 times over. One is left, after watching this series, with inkling of an idea of how insignificantly inferior, tawdry, and utterly, infinitely, and absolutely small one is compared to the wonder that is the planet on which we have been given the fortune of conducting our lives.""Blue Planet"" is inspiring, captivating, awesome, formidable, precious, and it makes the viewer fall in love with and care for our mighty mother earth. Highest possible recommendation."
5,Awsome Movie,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. This series and Planet Earth are both incredible, especially in HD. The price on Amazon is the best available, look it over in the store, then come here to buy it. Great gift!"
4,Educational and Fun to Watch,"We watched this with our children and they enjoyed watching it. Connect it to your surround sound and the music and effects will bring the movie to life! The kids described it in a lot of different ways (cool, sad, and even scary at times). They thought it was a great family night movie - and at under an hour it was a good length.My 10 year old thought it was sad when the killer whales attacked the grey whale...but it was a great chance to learn about the circle of life (which was a key teaching on this video).All in all this is a very fascinating and interesting movie with really impressive images and perspectives. We kept saying, ""And someone had to capture that shot!"" Definitely recommend this one."
5,Amazing series,Amazing series. Very entertaining and educational. If you love oceans or oceanography this is for you. Even if you have a mild interest in the natural world and environment this will be worthwhile.
4,BEAUTIFUL,"If you like nature shows at all, you will find this stuff fascinating. Very well-done and fantastic views of the water.Enjoyable for all ages. educational, too."
4,worth the money,"good DVD...I just disappointed about the packaging for collection set. Instead of a nice set like Planet earth, it is a plastic cover. However, it you jsut care about the DVD contant and quality, it is worth to buy"
5,amazing footage,"i bought this for my children and we all love it and everyone we have shared it with loves it to, so many things i never knew and so many facts incredibly photography well worth the money"
4,blu ray,"Hi , order was fast but ordered it in BluRay but did not receive it in blu ray otherwise all was fine loved it"
1,So sad!,"I received my Blue Planet DVD set in a timely fashion. I received them in the package new and they were in mint condition. I was excited and popped them in my DVD player. Bad News... they're messed up. The DVDs skip around and worse yet, three of them don't read at all. I tried them in two different DVD players and they still don't read. I'm sure this is not the sellers doing, rather, the manufacturers problem. My problem with the seller is that I have sent two emails to them and still, no response. This is terrible service and a terrible product. I;m frustrated. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,DVD Compatibility,"I don't know what DVD format it's in, but it's not backward with either of my two DVD players. This ticks me off. All it says is DVD, but have fun trying to play it if your DVD isn't new enough. It really stinks that they don't tell you about that in their advertisements."
1,Beautiful documentary of the world's awesome animal life!!,"Awesome!!! As appreciative and memerized individuals with creation, my husband and I were so pleasantly impressed with the imagery and hard work that went into the making of this awesome series. It's amazing how unique each part of creation in our known world is. It is also impressive to know that each one has it's own purpose or instinct that God placed in them like he has in us, to survive in some of the seemingly difficult circumstances or environments. I am so happy with having this series and have already convinced many of our friends to purchase it from the local Borders or Barnes and Nobles Books stores."
2,Beautiful but preachy,"The potential of this beautifully filmed show is seriously tarnished by the preachy 'humans suck' message. I get enough of this in my daily life. I'd rather not have it fed to me in every single movie, TV show, etc... that I watch. I watch these things to get away from reality for a few minutes..."
2,it is pretty boring,for the subject you would expect a bit more excitement. but they were pretty bland. I'll probably sell it on eBay.
5,"Stunning, Beautiful, Fascinating, Awe-Inspiring","These DVDs are beautifully filmed, interestingly narrated, and are the best ocean-related nature shows I've ever seen. They managed to film sights that I had never even dreamed existed, and frankly one of my favorite parts is the last 5 minutes of each episode where they show how they filmed some of the shots. It took 2 years of patience and waiting to get some of these shots and it was well worth it. Everything from tidal marshes to the depths of the abyss is covered and it is all fascinating.My only negative content is this is real life and there are a couple of scenes that might be too brutal for younger kids or for sensitive adults. But there are only a couple of scenes like that and I just close my eyes. Still, I don't recommend buying these as a gift for a 4-year-old."
5,Sublime Underwater Photography,"By far, the best documentary made on the life forms of the ocean, the ecosystems of the seas and the life of coastal animals. The stunning photography is superb. You wonder aloud, just 'how did they get that shot???' Often at the end of each episode, grouped thematically by ecosystem, you get a glimpse in the short segment known as 'diaries' where they show the cameramen and producers trying to get the shot, in the air, underwater, or on the shore. From the same group that brought us the amazing BBC series 'Planet Earth'. This is one addition to my library that I revisit again and again for both knowledge and pleasure."
4,Glorious images from the seas.,"Although not quite the ""complete natural history of our oceans"" the series claims to, there can be little doubt that the Blue Planet series is one of the finest documentaries on the subject ever made.The visuals are a treat to behold, from speeding tuna and sharks to pulsating jellyfish. Users of higher quality tv sets (especially HD sets) should put this at the top of their lists for reference quality video. In particular, shots of glowing jellyfish from ""The Deep"" showcase the capabilites of high quality sets.The sound is also quite good, although purists will note that sound effects have been added to increase dramatic effect. Whether you listen in stereo or in pro logic surround, the soundmix is always serviceable (although a true 5.1 mix would have ben nice).The series is certainly informative, but lets face facts. Most people who purchase this disk will do it for the eye candy, and will NOT be disappointed. Highly reccomended."
4,"Wondrous, but I'd rather hear Sir David than the music...","This is a beautifully filmed and presented documentary series, though that goes without saying if it's done by David Attenborough and his crew. I'm not sure if it's my cheap DVD player or the discs themselves, however, that are the cause of my only complaint. The music and effects, especially in the opening episode are so loud compared to Attenborough's narration that it must be turned up to an almost uncomfortable level to understand him over it. Coming from the Life of Birds series, which is flawless IMO, this was a disappointment. The scenes caught on film certainly are not! The episode travelling down to the deepest regions of the ocean provide probably the most fascinating visuals you'll ever see. You will literally be amazed that such creatures are actually a living part of the world that are almost completely unknown to anyone."
4,Incredibe,This DVD is an incredible piece of work. Father has seen it on other cable in the past but loves to watch it again and again. Now he can with his own copy.
4,Blue Planet - Seas of Life Review,"v. interesting, especially 'The Deep', a section about aquatic life in the deepest regions of the ocean. Some less interesting parts like 'open ocean' feel repetitive."
5,Gift,I got this as a gift for my friend. It shipped and was received sooner than I expected. She loves it. It was a great gift. I would totally recommend this.
5,Great,"Shipped Fast, good, quality videos for the inexpensive price. I would recommend this to a friend. I got this as a gift for my brother."
5,FAMILY FUN,What a great family gift for Christmas that we will get many hours of educational entertainment out of. Thank you Amazon.com for providing such a great product at such a wonderful price. Happy Holidays to all.
4,Good stuff...,I bought it for my dad as a gift and he cantstop sharing with his friends and co-workers.Its ok for the value...(btwn $25-$30).
2,not blu-ray,"We need a blu-ray version. Nobody really wants to watch low resolution DVD's anymore for documentaries. Sorry, we are spoiled. Create a blu-ray version that is not simply upscaled."
2,Scenic but violent,"A beautifully filmed documentary of ocean life. However, viewer beware: the series overemphasizes the reality of the often brutal food chain that supports ocean life, which can be unpleasant for adults and children alike. Drawn out attack and feeding frenzy scenes outweigh the otherwise interesting narrative about the many amazing species above and below the ocean. Discs 3-5 provide the best attention to the amazing variety of sea life, so rent those discs if you prefer a spectacular view into the underwater world. Later discs delve into the religious and political with discussions of dinosaurs and global warming. If you're looking for a spectacular peek into the underwater world, I'd more readily recommend the video, IMAX: The Living Sea.The Living Sea (IMAX)"
1,I did not buy because it hasn't subtitles in Portuguese,"Excellent documentary but inaccessible for Brazilians, has subtitles in Portuguese. It is sad that being despised by companhis produce these products ..."
1,Beautiful series. Wish I could watch it.,"I love Attenborough series, so I expected this would be great.And it is... what I can watch of it.Two separate copies have had visual and audio glitches and failed to play properly in any DVD player I own.I'm sure it's a lovely series, but the quality control here is just awful."
5,Great Videos!,"This is a great series. It has all the Blue Planet videos, plus some bonuses! Great info, but entertaining as well."
5,Blue Planet - great DVD,We loved this DVD and as a family have enjoyed watching it and sharing it with others - telling them and then showng them how wonderful it is.
1,Awards beyond my understanding,"If you like a violin concerto where the violinist is located somewhere behind the orchestra, buy this disk. Otherwise stay away. Or look elsewhere. Mullova/ Ozawa (BSO), Kyung Wha Chung/Previn (LSO) and Khachatryan/ Krivine (Sinfonia Varsovia) are fine choices. Heifetz/Hendl (CSO)is amazing, if a certain level of hiss doesn't bother you."
4,Surprisingly Excellent Replay Value For A Heist Flick,"This movie is a blast and a great take on a heist plot to boot! DeNiro and Norton are believable and likeable in these juicy rolls. Brando brings humor and emotional depth to a small but vital role. My only gripe is what's up with giving Angela Bassett such a small part in the story? This movie could've been a lot more fun if her character presented a twist in the romantic storyline or better yet, the heist storyline. A beautiful cast delivers the goods. The lighting, incorporated jazz, and editing are tight. The technical details help push a well planned story and also create an experience for the viewer that doesn't confuse or insult your intelligence. Nice."
3,The Score Review,"All right, the movie goes by kind of slow. However, I would go see it just to see the incredible ending. Robert De Niro and Edward Norton are outstanding as usual, however the plot lacks both the drama and the intestity. In the end, I was dissapointed with the movie except for the ending. If you are a fan of Edward Norton, you should definetely see this movie."
2,Not entertaining at all.,"I had high expectations for this movie because first it had my favorite actor Deniro in it and secondly he was acting with Norton who is a good upcoming star. Well I got shutdown. Deniros acting was great but the story was just boring. People say Norton acted good as the mentally challenged person but come on now, I think it'd be pretty easy to play a mentally challenged person. I didnt even think Brando had that good of a part. There no action at all in this movie, none. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the end, and Deniros acting."
2,mediocre,"good:1. action takes place in a foreign country! Canada and in foreign language (fr)2. no blood, no one killed (2 shots only)3. racially correct (fiance of RdN is black)bad:slow action, predictable, schematic, boring, abscence of imagination, non-entertaining. looks like a piece of ""lemon"" from the hollywood conveyer line. this is not ""movie art"", just an example of ""movie industry"".and finally, i realized why so high the crime rate in the usa, so low in canada: the canadian criminals never ""pee in their own pool"", that's why they come to the usa."
1,Unwatchable drivel,His girlfriend is black and she sings. She started singing and 5 seconds later I turned it off. Marlon Brandon made me puke down the front of my shirt.
2,"boring movie, same old plot.","Robert De Niro should retire. Edward Norton is pretty good, but both of them looked fake. The story was very plain in the first half, then it went into the tried and tried formula of excitment----who is cheating who? It was nicely executed, but had not much new elements to it, which made the movie boring. By the way, Robert De Niro is too fat to be a super thief."
3,Meuths!,"Good old fashioned caper flick with the always welcome Ed Norton. The kindness and consideration shown to Norton by his workmates and it's subsequent betrayal, probably negating the employment prospects of person with a genuine disability, ultimately makes the film a hard sell in regards to your long term affections.Brando still commands attention in a dandy performance although he not only appears to have mothballs in his mouth this time around but the moths as well. Attaboy, Marlon, and give the little perishers an extra chomp for me."
2,Not up to par!,Although the performances of both Edward Norton and Robert De Niro where great. The film did not deliver what you'd expect from a movie combining De Niro with Norton.The fact that De Niro and Norton gave great performances is something to be expected at this point in time. So we shouldn't be surprised that they did. We also expect them to be picky about what roles they will take.My opinion was that the film left me feeling very very deissapointed.
2,i can't believe this movie averages 4 stars,"everyone i have spoken to who has seen this movie found it mediocre at best. i paid 2 full price admissions (me and my wife) to see it in the theatre, and came out thoroughly disappointed. with the director and cast involved, i expected greatness, or at the very least, entertainment. what i walked out with was a profound sense of disappointment and regret for shelling out hard-earned money for a lackluster (and really quite predictable) heist movie that got average performances from great actors (deniro, norton), and a laughably poor performance from a once-great actor (brando). what peeved me the most was the fact that edward norton seemed to have been typecast with an almost exact replica of the character he played in primal fear, which led to a subconscious as well as conscious premonition that blew the so-called surprise ending... four stars my heinie."
3,Bare Bones,"Although not for everyone, The Score will be a refreshing change of pace in a summer of mummies and talking apes. With a collection of three of the greatest actors in the last fifty years, De Niro, Brando, Norton, the film seems it could be about quantum physics and be interesting. Frank Oz, usually sticking to family comedies, provides an inside look at the great heist in a very non Hollywood genre film. With Montreal providing a great Euro-style backdrop, the film provides the audience with a script that is very unpredictable and provoking. While lagging at times, the movie provides the smarter audience with a refreshing look minus the stable shootout ending."
3,Score is a 3 star movie but ends too soon,"It's your classic theif on his last job movie. A good companion to David Mamet's ""Heist"" which was better than this. It's about Brando's character and his last job for the thief, played by DeNiro. Ed Norton (no not the one from the Honeymooners) plays the young crook on the rise to the top hoping to one up DeNiro's big score. It's fun to watch and has one good twist that I guessed right away. You don't have to watch too many movies to see how the ending came out. All in all it's still a good movie to see DeNiro,Brando's performance (who could have been played by any character actor)and Edward Norton...who is the wild card in this movie...."
4,Very good Heist thriller with great acting...,"""The Score"" is a near excellent heist thriller with excellent acting by both the Robert De Niro, and Ed Norton. This is just a straight forward well examined heist film that is really made by the genuine and intriguing performances by De Niro and his younger counterpart Norton. Marlon Brando was def a weak link to this film, as all he really seemed to do was gasp for air with every breath he took and word he spoke. I also believe the romantic involvement between De Niro and Angela Bassett could have been developed a little more, as it kinda turned out to be a big part of the story. Other than that, this is a great film with a great ending!"
3,METHOD MAN,"3 of the best method actors in one movie.How can you go wrong. Of course THE SCORE wasn't the heaviest of movies for all of this talent.Like DENIRO doing his RONIN-HEAT character again. It was cool to see MARLON BRANDO ""not"" make a fool of himself. Infact BRANDO brings some needed leavity to the movie.Lets not forget EDWARD NORTON who did as much as you could to make his role respectable.Oh,you can sit back and rip this movie apart but the METHOD MAN, is just to sit back an have some fun for a coupla' hours."
4,Great cast and acting,"This movie has enough to be entertaining, though not the best performance of ANY of the actors in it. Deniro is his usual gruff self. While he is a great actor, watching the outtakes of him and Brando makes you think that he's done it all before. Brando on the other hand, while good, is totally out of it and it comes across in the film. He's trying, but he doesn't know he's there. Norton is once again great. This young actor is one of the best out there and delivers a great performance.Now, the plot of this movie is pretty cool. The whole heist thing keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat. This combined with the acting makes this a really good movie. Make sure to watch the special features to catch Brando out of it. And yes, he was wearing pants as far as I could tell."
2,Bad,"Fortunately for me, I rented it.This movie is really bad.It lags and drags for an hour and 45 minutes, and then suddenly and out of nowhere comes the action.The ending is expected.-RoNNY"
3,Old fashioned film for grownups,"Only slightly less so than de Niro's last big caper thriller, ""Ronin"", you could be forgiven for thinking ""The Score"" was made in the 70s. Only the presence of Edward Norton and the liberal use of the f-word link it loosely to the present. It's also very obviously targetted at a lately adult ""born in the 60s"" audience. It screams ""sophisticated adults only"", from the big name cast to the cod-jazz soundtrack to the faux-european setting (Montreal doubles for what probably should have been Paris or London). To its credit, with the exception of ""The Crimson Rivers"" it is the only big-budget film this year with a plot that keeps working all the way to the end of the 3rd act, and where the French film's plot finally collapses into the improbable this one stays true to its self-imposed ""reality"" and delivers an obvious but effective double-twist."
1,Something to fall asleep to,"Wow What a cast amazing actors old and new in this very bland and predictable movie about a big robbery(hence the score).Nothing that great to offer in the story department(seen it all before), but worth watching for performances by Edward Norton Robert De niro, and of course a very annoying and hard to understand Marlon Brando.This movie starts off very slow and continues on that track till the some what exciting end(although everyone knows or should know what is coming at the end.)So I say this is just another average movie with an average story but staring a great cast.Rent it but please do not buy (unless you are having trouble sleeping...hammy"
1,I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.,"I wonder if this was written in the same amount of time it takes to watch. The actors may not have been given any direction at all. It seemed like I was watching an unfinished version, as if they weren't done editing the film and scoring the music. The story takes a couple turns, but it's about as suspenseful as a ferris wheel. I love De Niro and Tyler Durden, but honestly, unless you have nothing else to waste your time and money on, don't bother with The Score."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's a plot that didn't interest me (they had about 3 plots running at the same time.....guy in a scam for the money, another guy falling in love, and the same guy trying to pay off his debts) While Norton did a good job of playing a guy who acts ..., De Niro hasn't changed....he's still boring and I don't find him such a great actor.....his movies don't interest me but I saw this one since I heard good things about it....I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.....the only good scene was the last one but the rest is all dialogue and useless scenes....don't waste your money."
1,perhaps the most over-rated movie ever,"With a cast full of great actors and a classic plot this should have been an excellent movie. However, it moved painfully slowly towards an overly abrupt ending. Norton did a great acting job which often causes viewers to consider this a quality movie. He is so good that often the nonsensical ending to the movie is overlooked. If you believed that this was a good movie I ask you to watch it once more and try to imagine how the heist could possibly be pulled off in that manner, there are siply too many flaws to deal with. Feel free to watch this movie, but please think about it before you take the slow paced plot as a sign of quality."
1,Why did I pay to see this in a theater?,"I saw this movie with a friend, both of us having the expectation of a suspenseful movie. The only suspense found was trying to remember how much longer I would be stuck in the movie. It is a very bad sign to leave a movie feeling that a ticket to Jurassic Park III would have been a better investment."
3,"Should have been called ""The Snore"" instead","This movie starts out slooooowwwwww....and stays slow for at least an hour. They definetly did not need to make the movie as lengthy as they did. I think about an hours worth could have been left on the cutting room floor. But the acting was pretty good, and I liked the ending too. And there was definetly some good suspense that had me holding my breath. I just recommend keeping your finger on the FFWD button for those slow as molasses moments where there is no dialogue or real action anyways... just Robert Dinero walking around town, etc. I would recommend this if you have patience and aren't expecting a lot of action or special effects."
2,Boring and formulaic,"Despite nice performances by DeNiro, Norton and Brando, this movie never gets going. The plot is a mild variation from the genre. The only thing that keeps this from being a standard B movie is the cast and a few (very few) nice lines of dialog.One of the big disappointments in the movie is that we never get to know the characters. We know absolutely nothing about Norton's character, slightly more about DeNiro's and a little more about Brando's."
3,Where Is The Score?,The Score is a good film that would have been much better had Brando stopped reading CoEvolution Quarterly (Whole Earth Review) long enough to really put his hand to the plow. Ed Norton turns in a brilliant portrayal of the kind of punk we've seen in real life. The surprise ending calls for a sequel where ex-con Norton comes back angry for revenge and gets nailed again.
4,Woo hoo,"Great movie...good story, suspense, and limited action scenes couple by Ed Norton's great acting (and hot ...) and De Niro's...well De Niro is just cool. Marlon Brando is kind of freaky, though."
3,Slightly better than Average,"for a Film with Names like Angela Basett,Edward Norton,Robert De Niro&Marlon Brando it doesn't exactly Burn up the screen.matter of fact Cassandra Wilson who sings in a Club Owned by DeNiro's Role is the most Sparkling thing to me in the whole film.and once you have been Spolied by the Matrix you just don't go for the Heist in this film fully.this is a another example of where Too Much Talent&Not any Flaw in the Actors can hurt a Film because the Film is Flawed&shows no Hope Of THe Talent that was brought together.wasted chance.some good exchanges but a run of the Mill Action film."
3,Average movie. A bit slow and predictible.,"The movie was ok. The acting was acceptable with some exceptional moments by Norton. The major problems I had were with the speed of the film. It dragged except for the very end and the end was predictable. Realistically, I would have been happy renting this movie in a couple months. If you are a real Norton/De Niro fan, you may find it worth the $8 to get in the door, otherwise wait for the video because the film is not worth seeing in the theater."
3,Intelligent,"The Score is a very clever and intriguing crime movie. Although it is not of the same caliber as Shawshank Redemtion, it does seem to provide an excellent ""inside look"" at the world of high-risk thieves, including planning and overall execution. The film is boring in very few instances and comes together at the end with pure creativity."
2,"Bad, unneccesary language. Too dark","THis was very dark and cheerless. Good suspense and acting but not one I would recomend. It is too bad faul language has to be put in when it does nothing to contribute. I get the fact that many people talk that way in these situations, but it serves no purpose to have it in this movie."
5,The score,"Full of suspense! Ed Norton always has a surprise at the end of the movie. If you've never seen this movie, you will be surprised at the ending!!!! Robert DiNero is awesome and so is Marlon Brando. It has humor and excitement."
4,Excellent Plot----LOTS of profanity though,"If you can just get past the ""M.F."" all through the movie, I think you will really enjoy this. It has a great plot and it is very suspenseful. I don't particularly care for Marlon Brando, but even he is good the little he is in the movie. DeNiro is his usual self---a very good actor and Edward Norton simply steals the entire movie in my opinion! This is well worth watching, I promise!"
4,Heist film overwhelmed by technology,"This would be a pretty good ""Heist"" film, in fact I saw a film with that name just before seeing this, but I found the amount of hi-tech gadgetry to be an obstacle... c'mon fellows, you'd have to be a NASA-trained engineer to be able to use all of that stuff, rob THAT safe, etc. It's fun (if not at all original) to watch these guys strut their stuff, but I just found myself unable to suspend disbelief. NO-ONE could possibly do what these gentlemen set out to do. Sorry about that *Spoiler*What really workede for me though was the relationship between the extremely talented Edward Norton, de Niro and Marlon Brando. They were all perfect for the rle, as was the marvellous Angela Bassett. Great cast in the wrong movie? Probably, but you can still have a lot of fun working your way through all the twists and turns of what should have been a much better movie."
4,The Scepter Caper,"The score is about stealing a scepter. Robert DeNiro, Ed Norton, and Marlon Brando scheme and plan to steal a King's scepter in the Montreal Custom House. Norton has a janitorial job there to help them get inside. Between wondering how to make the job work and wondering who they can trust there is a fair amount of suspense. Fans of movies like ""The Italian Job"" and ""Foolproof"" should enjoy it. Very good acting in this movie and you will appreciate Norton's ability especially as once again he shows another personality as he did in ""Primal Fear"". DeNiro and Brando are excellent as always. I highly recommend this crime caper movie."
5,The Score: Smart With Heart,"The Score is hugely entertaining. Set in Montreal, Canada, the environs are familiar yet slightly foreign. Robert De Niro's gentleman thief character Nick is likeable and believable. His day job is owner of the NYC jazz club.In a memorable scene, Nicky offers rock solid middle class advice to would be hot shot Edward Norton's character by advising him never to take longshots or high risks. ""Make a list of everything you want and take the next twenty years to get it."" Sounds more like a stock broker than a master thief.The Score's score is superb. Jazzy and atmospheric.The actual theft and escape scene is creative and well orchestrated.Great movie with a great twist."
2,3 Generations of Top Acting Talent Wasted,"Yes, this film shows the A list actors of the '50s, '70s and '90s in a totally predictible, flat caper film. DeNiro is the main thief who works in association with Brando and is aided by Norton. Norton does do an astonishing acting job portraying a retarded man, at his job in the customs house as a janitor, so that he can scope out the scene of his crime. When he's not at work, he is ""normal"" and the character trait difference is extreme. In fact, maybe this film had an overload of talent and should have just used Norton in this role as a solitary thief, especially since DeNiro and Brando don't get a chance to show off their similar range of ability. A huge disappointment for me since I normally love Brando and DeNiro in anything."
2,OK movie; average script; poor ending,"This movie reminded me (because of the way it was wrapped up) of ""Boiler Room,"" that movie that contained less than 10 minutes of really good acting (Ben Affleck's cameos), with an OK script, but a lousy ending! Same here... When it was over my wife and I looked at each other like ""What on earth happened here? Is that all?"" The plot, pretty basic: De Niro is Nick: he steals expensive jewels and collectibles for a living and is faced with a very large coup, his last one, where he's joined by Edward Norton (Jack). It's SO predictable that Jack is going to try to set Nick up, that I don't mind saying it here! Plus, Marlon Brando's part is more than secondary: in fact, you could almost do away with it altogether... Don't know: the more I think about the movie, the less stars I feel like giving it. At least I didn't pay [money] for two movie tickets!"
2,Disappointing Is A Compliment,"I had high hopes for this movie, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton, how could I go wrong with this movie with a cast like that? Despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script. The film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me. This was a poorly contrived and at times silly film. The tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try. Embarassing for all involved. I only give it two stars to be nice to the cast."
2,Just Plain Predictable,"You have to wonder how Hollywood is greenlighting screenplays these days. This formulaic, predictable and utterly unimaginative heist-flick has only one redeeming quality - its cast. But sadly, the absence of a quality script is highlighted by the fact that the cast is so good, since you can't help but notice that they have absolutely nothing to work with. The twist at the end is such a lame payoff that a high schooler could have thought of it, and the audience is left thinking...that's it? Is that what I waited 2 hours for? All in all, if it's on TV it's ok as background noise, other than that, don't waste your time."
2,Does not meet the expectations,"When you have a cast of Edward Norton, Robert Dinero and Marlin Brando you expect a great hit. Unfortunalty this wasn't it.The acting obviously was great. All three lived up to there abilities, the plot however was too straight and plain. I kept waiting for the twist that would make the movie but it never came. It is really an unfortunate dissapointment"
2,A Waste of a Brilliant Cast,"I saw this movie because of the dazzling cast only to find out they were wasted on a luke-warm script and a less than dazzling heist. Everyone seemed to be walking through there parts, with the possible exception of Edward Norton. Though it has immense potential, the result is annoyingly flat. If you want to see Edward Norton preform in a movie you'll actually enjoy, try Fight Club, American History X, or Primal Fear."
5,DeNiro Scores Again,I love the movie.......i loved the twist and turns of the picture.....im a big Deniro fan...as well as Ed Norton......DeNiro always delivers...I was very surprised by the way the picture ended.........I also enjoyed seeing Deniro with a girlfriend.....not some cupcake but a real woman....Angela Bassett made a wonderful companion for him....liked the interplay between them....cant wait for the DVD to come out....
5,Hi my Name is Willy,i like to play games and eat cheese i normally don't watch none moving picture shows but my big sister larry made me watch this one i laughed the whole way through you ought see this sho
4,Not Deniro or Norton's best work .... but still pretty good.,"This is a film about two thieves who have been hooked up together by a common benefactor (Marlon Brando). Robert Deniro plays the aged veteran thief looking for that one final score to give him enough to retire on. While Edward Norton is the ""new blood"" who's worked his way inside of the installation with an absolutely brilliant performance as a mentally handicapped janitor. Norton really showed how good of an actor he is, he rivaled his performance from Primal Fear.But this movie is sold on Deniro's acting. He carries the ending, it's great. You realize how good Deniro is when sells the ending perfectly. Brando's performance is decent, although he was a little difficult to understand at one point."
4,Good Ride,"There are problems with the story, but the acting is brilliant, the sets are beautiful, the props are convincing, and in all it's a fun film, particularly for buffs of the thief/true-crime genre, of which there are sadly few really good films, probably the best of which is The Day of the Jackal. Now that was a five star film. But this was fun."
5,...the return of: the slow-paced thriller...,"i bought this not expectin 'die hard' or 'rush hour'...i wanted a good ol' fashioned movie, well fashioned and devoid of computer enhanced action sequences! and that's what i got...the plot is nothin new (crooked men doin crooked things hopin to reach that point where they can go straight - yawn, been there/done it), but i'm a fan of de niro's and of norton's ('fight club' is my ish!) and i got what i wanted from this...much better to my likin than 'the thomas crown affair' or 'entrapment'...'the score' woulda fell into the same mode as those movies if angela bassett woulda turned out to be a world-jetting, ex-c.i.a. operative turned jewel thief-informant-double agent! she doesnt...she's just a airline attendent lookin to settle down with someone she can trust and love...i'm cool with that...for those of yall that liked de niro in 'ronin', yall will proly enjoy this one just as well..."
2,Don't play the game if you ain't gonna score...,"...in this case, as an entertaining film & story. This project misses the mark big time. I agree with others that wrote about the film having an unfinished feel to it. I'm a fan of DeNiro but he was definitely on lithium throughout production. Norton is the highlight, but doesn't [take]the show because there isn't one. You get the feeling you're watching the ""dailies"". Frank Oz should stick to light-hearted comedies.Elegant Angela Basset is wasted in the three measly unimportant scenes she's in (obviously a DeNiro cast choice since everyone knows he's always preferred black women).Two stars for both of Norton's characters. Basset should go back to finding her career groove, and if this is the type of character DeNiro is comfortable in playing, he is quickly joining Jack Nicholson in simply not trying anymore.It's pretty much a ""[copy]"" of the great Michael Mann film ""Thief"". I dare you to watch that and see the blatant comparisons."
2,Scores only slightly more than the Detroit Lions,A great waste of Deniro and Ed Norton. What you would expect from a Brando movie I guess.
2,Once again a bad experience with Invicta,"This is my second Invicta, and once again I am disappointed. I bought their Atomic Watch and it arrived broken. I called Invicta's Customer Service and after 3 days and leaving 5 messages with no response, I sent the watch back vowing nevert to buy Invicta again.I broke my vow and bought Invicta's Pro-Diver, the watch that supposedly ""put Invicta on the map."" The Tritnite is the only impressive thing about the watch. The besel does not turn without special tools, so it is useless as a Diver Watch. The crown wiggles which makes it difficult to screw it down properly. The pins are hard to get at so forget about swapping out the 2 rubber bands that come with the watch.Don't go out of your way to buy Invicta. Find a company with a quality product, and a Customer Service department that actually provides service."
2,"The dial lost its luster, probably due to seal or cheap glass","Invicta Men's 8926RSET Pro Diver Collection Automatic Watch, The dial lost its luster, probably due to seal or cheap glass. Will not buy this again"
4,My 21 mo old twins love this video,"This is a great little people video. My boys can watch it over and over again. It teaches about working together to solve problems and helping each other out. We have alot of the little people and the toys that are in the video, and I think my kids like that too. I would highly recommend this video for toddlers and preschoolers."
2,Pass on This One,"Positive: large easy-to-read digital numerals, acceptable radio/sound quality for the price.Negative: Markedly inferior sensitvity to the radio signal emanating from Colorado---often was unable to ""get it"" even when my other atomic clocks easily received the signal."
1,The Worldest Greatest Con Men,"Tiger and his father have now been proved to be among the greatest con men in history! How can Tiger pretend to be interested in children if he does not even value his own children. I don't think you will be interested in this book, unless you enjoy very strange humor."
2,Not recommended,This tape does not include Ali's best material - his repartee with Howard Cosell. I was disappointed that the interview footage shown here does not give a glimpse of Ali's fierce intelligence and sense of humor. The tape provides a rather dull 40 minutes showing career highlights and badly-synched interview segments.
3,for ALI completists only....nothing revelatory here.,"This is a VERY short (38minutes) Collection of Ali interviews surrounding his fights...and often in very grainy black and white condition that seems almost bootleg in its lack of sharpness. This is the connective tissue they present between the bouts on bigger programs and run together make for a pretty dry viewing experience that somehow seems LONGER Than its mere 38 minutes. I love Ali, am glad to have it but would NOT recommend it to anybody but an Ali collector who has Ringside and the Complete and heck almost all the other DVDs available which are better."
4,No Home Should Be Without One,"In an age where we depend on computer spell check, it's easy to overlook the convenience and usefulness of having this set at your finger tips. All to often, we settle for the first word that comes to mind because we just can't remember that one perfect adjective that would describe exactly what we want to say.Mirriam Webster's set to the rescue! Not only can I find the right word, I have the resources to understand that word's origins, how to correctly use it in a sentence and where it needs to be divided, if necessary.The leather-like binding looks impressive on my desk and it makes pretty good bedtime reading when I'm hungry for abstract information."
2,Poor material quality,"These Families of the World videos are great, educational tools. However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs. My copy of Puerto Rico families was only played 2x. When I went to clean the disk it cracked down the middle. I looked at the back and the disk quality is that of a burned disk copy, not the professional grade you expect from a DVD purchase."
1,"didnt s end me either of the 2 products i ordered instaed send you 2 products from 2 differat companies , which did",they sent me 2 differ ant products from 2 differant companies...didnt fit tigether or work...had to find a nother alternative to finsh my project cost me time and money....will warnb others about buying products from you or the supplkier DEERSO.....STILL WAITING FOR MY REFCUND After they recieved bad products back....thomas and bettts is thomas and betts...not one item from hubbel?raco and the other paRT FROMN STEEL CITY......
5,Just discovered this series!,This is a wonderful book. I just discovered that this series exists. I never knew about these people before. The book is fast-moving and exciting and Jess is a very believable person. I can't wait to read the others!
1,Cold Blood,This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is horrible and the plot is non-existant. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!
5,Freezer Warms Up Its Audience,"This is a thriller that won't leave you wilted and frustrated. Freezer features a strong cast, good sound and image quality developed from a tight script that is true to its characters. You could call this a low cost film; I prefer to call it priceless. I saw this film at a festival and am delighted to see it is out now on DVD. By the way, they actually call this film Freez'er. If you have seen it, you can figure out the title."
5,Greek City-States vie for Soft Power,"While many games list 2 player aren't very good two player, this one is. It is also a great 3 or 4 player game. It is a good introduction to Euro games without too many pieces or rules. The expanding board makes long term strategy exiting and fluid. With two ways to win (use all your buildings or connect oracles) strategy decisions are immense.Must have for a Euro gamer or a Greek History nut."
4,Good Read,"This book was very well written. It wasn't what I expected at all. It had romance, drama and suspense. The male lead was very interesting. As a pastor, the author shows all of the real life ""sins"" that we must encounter each day. I liked the way the author weaved the romance into a situation that would normally not happen. So, before I give too much away - take a chance on this book. I was hooked by page 4. On another note, Indigo (Sens Love Stories) should better reflect the covers of their books based on the stories."
3,Too unrealistic but not a bad read,Ok you need to really suspend belief in the real world to accept that a surrogate mother expects the father of the baby to fall in love with her just two months after the death of his wife.Consider also the father is a pastor and the surrogate mother is a former exotic dancer. Apart from that unrealistic plotline the story would have made a 4 star.
4,HEARTWARMING,"I know the title is ""Claudia and Mean Janine"" but I think CLAUDIA was the one being super rude and mean in this book. She constantly thinks badly of her sister, without fully understanding the situation. I guess it is because she is so wrapped up in the idea that Janine thinks she is better than Claudia, but I personally think that that is a seed Claudia planted herself. Mimi's stroke was sad and hard to read, but in the end it brought them closer together."
5,cool book for kids,"claudia's grandmother, mimi had stroke. janine seems to be controlling mimi's life and she's ruining the summer playground program!"
4,"Completing my ""My Bookhouse"" set","This book, received in far better conddition than I expected, completed a set of five volumes given me by a neighbor family in 1935, and treasured ever since!! I was astonished at its reasonably good condition, and enormously pleased to obtain it!!"
1,boring and stupid,"I am nine years old and I had to read this book for school.I do not recomend this slow moving, dull book for you.This is more like pre-k reading level.I hope you like my report."
4,"Basic, Very Basic",This guide was a very basic approach to decorating.It was a good book but not very exciting nor enthusing.
2,Boring,"This book was produced to appeal to the broadest spectrum of people. It neither has one coherent style throughout the book, nor does it give accurate representation to all styles available. It tries to represent many different styles, but in the most generic way possible. There is the occasional nice picture, but not enough of them to justify buying the book. Most of the furniture is overstuffed and there are lots of florals. Now I like florals and include them in my decorating schemes. However, there is a point at which you just have to say no. The cover does give some indication of what you will find in the book, so if you like that maybe you will like the rest of the book. However, I would not recommend it."
5,A great album...,"This CD was amazing! I hadn't expected it to be this good when I ordered it, but I was definitely mistaken! It is definitely worth the money. I recommend it to everyone, Jonathan Jackson fan or not."
3,"The previous reviewer has some points, ...but...","I appreciated the input of the previous reviewr, but ther eare a couple of items, not having to do with this particular recording that I have to add an addendum. the 7-string bass viol (or viola da gamba) is NOT an ancestor of the cello, or any instruments in the violin family. Historical evidence, as well as extensive research show the viola da gamba family was connected to the development of the lute and early guitars in Europe 70 years before the fist violin family instruments begin to appear. Please note, I am NOT referring to vielles or any other precursors of bowed string instruments in Europe. A simple web search will yield many other viola da gamba soloists, many of whom are exeptional performers.Phillip W. Sernaphillipwserna.com"
1,as bad as it gets,This is by far the worst salsa dancing i ever saw... Ive been dancing for a couple of years now and i was looking something do improve my repertorium. Im trying to sell my copy but i dont think theres anyone interested.
1,A joke,This is a joke....and was a complete waste of my money. Its the most random Salsa instructional DVD that i have ever seen.
2,"Mostly introductory material, and not too complex","Most of the information found in this book can be found elsewhere, but it stil provides some frame of reference for those early forays into what went wrong for the particpants of WW2. This may be useful for those folks who are simply seeking some quick stories of bad decisions and their results."
3,Correction to the one underneath,"My recommendation was for the Oxford rather than the Everyman edition, edited by L.G. Mitchell. I apologise for this error."
1,"Text is Great, Intro by L.G.Mitchell is better","Can't improve on the text of REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE. He was the dominant political thinker of the last quarter of the 18th century in ENgland. His reputation depends less on his role as a practising politician than on his ability to set contemporary problems within a wider context of political theory. The introduction by L.G. Mitchell argues this point congently. Mitchell's intro appears in the Oxford University Press edition. It's cheaper, too."
2,Difficult,"I am using this book for my masters' degree in education, it is difficult to follow so far. Not a good choice to learn how to design a curriculum."
1,No Help for my Class!!,This book is easy to read and does not take too long to complete but it has been little or no help for my curriculum development class I am currently taking. I have had to buy other books and do a lot of research online in order to complete any of my assignments.
1,Boring...,This book is required in my masters course. It's very difficult to read because it's SO boring and wordy. I'll be glad when I'm done with it.
2,I had a problem,Correct part but it was broken because the person who did inspect the box would have seen the holds in it.And I would tell you that if it was my business all of my staff would have the right to not ship a broken part but get it replaced.would have more respect for that shipper. So when back on line and found the part local and was able to get my car back up and running. yes I would buy again and I had a problem with this but the return and refund was fast and for that i give you an A+.
1,Grizzly is BAD,"After Grizzly shipped the package via USPS to save a few bucks, and I did miss address my own address, USPS lost the package. Grizzly blamed me for their lack of business skills, and has refused to do business with me again. Now think about this, a $30 item, USPS lost and they don't want to do business with me. Guess what, I don't want to do business with Grizzly again.I love Amazon, but Grizzly just doesn't get what customer service is!!!"
4,cheesy but effective,"I seem to be addicted to self-help books, so I think I can sound off here. I really liked this book. Maybe I'm not the ""everything sucks, life is terrible"" type, but I get stuck in negative patterns like everyone else. Instead of preaching about symptoms and identifying the problem, this book gave me concrete ideas on how to deal with life's little kicks in the shins. The suggestions were great -- better than a book that just said ""hey, you're negative, isn't that awful?"" it gave you exercises to PULL YOU OUT OF YOUR PATTERNS. And that made all the difference."
2,Not all of us are negative !,"The book leads you to believe that everybody is a negaholic. Even if you're not really addicted to negativity, you'll find out that you're a negaholic anyway. It also waffles on quite a bit before it actually gets to the point, i.e. how to overcome the negativity that you may not even have.However, the examples are realistic and despite the fact that there isn't a great deal of advice there, people who are negaholics may see themselves in these examples and find that helpful. Good luck to negaholics ! If you're just a bit negative on occasional basis and suspect that you're a negaholic, don't waste your time. It's normal and you can't be classified as a negaholic but this book will tell you that you're just to get you to buy it."
4,"Many great hits, However..........","I do not have this ""CD"" just yet.This greatest hits CD has lots of songsfrom many of the past DL albums. Which is way cool.However, not enough from their lastalbum, titled 'x'.I see only (2) listed; Long Long way to go and Now.How a bout:4-Letter Word,Unbelievable,Everyday,Torn to ShredsLove Don't LieGirl Like Youand not to mention ""Gravity""All these songs are waycool and not evenlisted on this ""Best of"".Makes me (Def Leppeard Die Hard) truly sad."
1,The Leps have gone downhill,Its a sad thing really. Whats next guys a Christmas album? A two disc set with only one new track (and it sucks). Def Leppard went downhill after Steve Clark died and their biggest mistake was hiring a talentless guitarist like Vivian dumbell.
4,Running out of ideas ?,"Being a die hard fan for 15 plus years, I finally see the end. The second disk is truly a great compliation but do we really need another GH's compliation ? I think the boys in Leppard are starting to run out of ideas . I hope they prove me wrong and release another Slang type of album but i think the end is near for one of the best bands of the 80's. I still rate this high just for the songs, not for the release. Come on Def Leppard prove me wrong and release a killer studio record in 2005 not a covers cd."
5,A GREAT collection of Leppard,"This is an incredible collection of Def Leppard songs and it's nice to put in and go through 25 years of Def Leppard with just this double cd set....there's a lot of people saying it's missing this song or that song, but in order for it to have every song everyone wants, you would just have to put all of their songs on it. I am very happy with the list of songs on it and if you want the ""Best Of"" Def Leppard, then this is the cd to buy! If you're a hardcore Def Leppard fan, then this is a MUST BUY! It's a waaaaay better version of ""Vault"", and an updated version at that. Not only do you have very early songs such as ""wasted"" and ""let it go"" but you also get some of their newer ones like ""Long Long Way To Go"" (a personal favorite of mine), ""Slang"", ""Promises"", and even a BRAND NEW never before released song called ""Waterloo Sunset"" ( a cover of The Kinks song), which is a VERY good song. I think anyone that likes Def Leppard, will LOVE this album!"
3,damaged case last song will not play,case was broke on the inside and the last song will not play.it was not worth the money to send back.
4,"Women, Men, and Society","I ordered this book for my Sociology online class. I have not completed the course yet, but so far the book has been interesting. It has insights as to how society view women and how it affects all of us. The authors research,theories and to view the social issues from a sociologist's point of view. It is a good educational book.Women, Men, and Society"
2,I Love It...,"But my seven month old daughter HATES it. She gets so overheated, and it's only November. I cannot imagine using this in hot weather. I finally just found a 100 percent cotton long sleeve bib from Etsy. This won't be used. What a waste of $30 dollars."
3,Less laundry,"I've used this smock since my baby was 8 mo. It runs a little big, but it's still usable. I don't need to change his clothes as often which is great. You can just wipe this with a wet towel after each feeding and reuse it later. I don't wash it that much since the stitching around the sleeves seems to be wearing out."
5,WORTH THE MONEY!!,"I hesitated to spend $30.00 on an art smock-which is what we use it for. It is definitely worth it! Wipes clean easily or under running water. Covers the clothes. Runs big, which is great for older toddlers to use."
5,Smock,"A must for mealtime and snacktime with a toddler. Well made. It should last through many meals and will be well used for craft/paint projects--whenever the child needs a good ""cover-up."""
3,Runs big,"I bought this for my one year old and it was huge. I planned on using it in place of a bib, but sent it back because it was too large. It was cute and well made, but intended for an older child."
5,clothing saver,got this for son when he does his art classes it is great planning on getting another for home
2,over priced,"I bought this item because of the brand. However, it's not wroth the price for this item. It made of cheap material."
4,Functional,Great little smock for eating and art. Unfortunatly the front of our is torn. Still works just does not look as pretty.
4,Great...and HUGE,"This bib certainly covers it all. When she stands around in it she looks like she's wearing a Renaissance painter's smock. It's so big that it takes up a bit of room in the diaper bag and I feel like a dork whipping out The Tent at restaurants. We use this bib at home when she needs to have her entire lap covered. Note: the extra length does you no good if your child is in a high chair with any apparatus between the legs. Kind of like putting a girl in a dress into her carseat--the dress bunches up in the crotch and leaves the legs exposed. Same concept. (This includes restaurant high chairs, unless you put the bib on the outside of the rail.)Love that it has large, easy to use snaps instead of velcro.Will also use this when creating art projects because yes, it's THAT big."
5,Greatest Bib ever!,"Every mom and dad with a little one should own this bib it is worth every penny. It covers all your little ones clothes and keeps them clean, it's long enough too that it covers their lap. The snap in the back is nice too since she can't pull it off like the Velcro dibs. It washes up really nice and drys quickly too. I ditched all my other bibs and use only this one. Now if I could just keep the little one from throwing her food on the floor."
2,Better for Art than for Eating!,"I bought this to use as a giant bib since my boy is a very active eater who always seems to get the undersides of his arms covered with food. This happens when he twists and turns in his chair and reaches for food, drink, etc.,. The smock provides great coverage but it could benefit from a pocket along the bottom and it could be much easier to clean. I have other ""safe"" plastic/vinly type bibs that are much easier to clean so I hardly use this one. I would not recommend it for a messy eater or even a mildly messy eater as it does not clean or dry quickly, especially for the price. Also, the color is not very well defined so food can get under it fairly easily, a wider border would be helpful. I can absolutely see using it less frequently for art projects like painting."
3,Way to big for an infant,"I love the idea of this bib...completely covering a baby for meals, but it is WAY too big! It says it is sized to fit from 8months plus. I have an 8 month old and have to roll the sleeves up and use a rubber band to hold them in place. The neck line is the only thing that I really like; it fits close so no stray food ends up behind the bib. Overall, the bib is well-made, but certainly wasn't made for an infant!"
5,Dr Dan Levi Gives HIS HIGHEST RATING to this book!,"In a word, this book is simply a TREMENDOUS resource for any parent. Cara Familian Natterson is a very highly regarded pediatrician is the greater los angeles area. Although she trained at Harvard, UCSF and Johns Hopkins, she approaches all subjects in a thoughtful and non-intimidating approach. She is able to use her superior knowledge of pediatrics to provide an informative overview for any parent. All (or almost all) of your questions will be answered by this read. THIS BOOK IS A MUST BUY. If you buy one book to learn about your newborn -THIS SHOULD BE IT!!"
3,No Directions,I'm a novice learning how to play the timbales and there were no directions provided on how to assemble this or recommended setups
5,fits the rest just fine...,Silent plate fits just fine as well as the arrow rest. The arrow rest needed trimming and a touch of glue on the cut edge. I still shoot a recurve and couldn't believe stores don't carry this item.
2,Hardly about desert plants,"I returned this book because it was full of advice about how to plant and maintain plants that are not native to the desert: bermuda grass, citrus, grapes, tomatoes, mums...Almost nothing about the native plants of the desert Southwest. I would not recommend it."
3,Desert Landscaping,"Not very happy with this book. The only color photo is the cover. All other photos are black and white, and don't do justice to depecting landscaping and flowers. Book was copywrighted approximaqtely 18 years ago, therefore feel it is somwhat out of date with knowledge."
3,Patti sings karaoke classics,The musical arrangements for these cover songsare bland and very unimaginative. I agree withthe poster who feels Patti should have hired aband to do the whole thing live. The backingtracks have a cheap feel to them. Where's thefire in the music to match Patti's passionateinterpretations. And speaking of her voice...She seems to have lost her mid and lower rangethrough the years. Why are the low notes sofragile for her sing yet she can blast you outof the hemisphere with her upper-range.
2,Disappointing,"So the new formula seems to be for aging R&B, rock and even rap artists to release an album of ""classic"" tunes in an attempt to capture the ear (and wallets) of baby-boomers who can't relate to 50 cent and Kelly Clarkson and, thus, to revive flagging musical careers. While it's worked quite well for Queen Latifah, Rod Stewart and Chaka Khan, it fails mserably with this CD. I'm an admirer of Patti, but quite frankly, her voice has not held up so well. More disappointing though is the poor production quality on this CD. The music and background vocals seem lifted from a karaoke disc. Buy a greatest hits CD and try to remember her at her best."
2,NO,"Fist off I have to say I loved Patti Labelle--she was truly a legend. However, this cd supports the advice she received from a throat specialist (tv1 interview)who said, ""you must stop singing."" For those who may be wondering why she is only singing in her mid to low register, that is why. The prayer of Diana Ross has finally been answered: Patti has finally lost her voice. Celine Dion once rested her voice (no speaking or singing) for three weeks and was able to restore her voice. I don't know the extent of Ms. Labelle's vocal damage(she told a sound engineer who suggested she wait a couple of weeks to overcome ""hoarseness"" that ""its not going to get better"") but she should at least consider a rest, if not for herself, let me stop."
2,very Average,"Patti Labelle is a very Talented singer,but She usually gets the short end of the Musical Stick when it comes Album projects.alot of this Album she is Oversinging&the Material doesn't match her Intensity at all on a whole.this is another in a long line of just Ok Patti Labelle Albums.She makes tight Singles but never gets a Album that captures Her range&Depth fully."
3,". . .and I like ""Covers""","Harnessing powerful voices, restricting them to the confines of a recording studio and delivering a great sounding record is a difficult task for any producer. Patti Labelle's ""Classic Moments"" makes a valiant attempt, but misses the mark on some of the selections. Certainly, this CD would have served the fans' (including me) better as a live recording. That being said, Patti's powerful vocal interpretation on most of the cuts is unmistakably brilliant. However, some selections (He's Out Of My Life, I Can't Make You Love Me) disappointingly miss the mark. Although Mary J. Blige's vocal performance doesn't necessarily offer the same balance that she and Whitney had on the VH1 Diva's special, ""Ain't No Way"" is still a great cut and has radio potential. After listening to the CD several times, ""I'll Write A Song For You"" has turned out to be my favorite."
2,Why?,"This recording is just ok. I didn't see why she needed to do a cover cd patti is so much better than this and it's not that she is singing the songs just ok it's just that she doesn't add anything different to them to make me say yeah thats it. make the next recording will be the one i can enjoy until then i guess i will put ""flame' my favorite patti cd."
4,DIVA DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!,"Althought not her best...""FLAME"" holds that distinction, this album is well worth the bucks. and yes, some songs, vocally, are better than others but this is still a cd i can put in and let play from beginning to end. MY FAVE SONG HAS TO BE ""YOUR SONG""! when elton calls out her name toward the end of the song and she answers ""YES"" at the top of her longs....i was on the floor laughing....that heffer better work. only patti can get away with something like that. other songs i like are ""i keep forgetting"", ""love don't live"", ""love ballad"". ""aint no way""..aw heck..all of em are good. that said, buy the album and enjoy. it's some good stuff! oh...love the arrangements. very classy...of course this just my biased opinion. LOL!"
4,Average to Good!!!!,"Patti sings these songs like the pro she is! I have always thought that Patti can sing very well. She and her record company probably thought that this CD was a good idea, keeping her in the spotlight, singing familiar tunes. Most of these songs, Patti sings with ""her own spirit"" which is mostly a treat for me. She is creative and always gives her best...whatever that is for her.The best sung songs on this project seem to be ""I Keep Forgetting"", ""Your Song"" and that classic dance tune..""You're Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else"". The others are cool but Patti seems to be struggling vocally a bit. Nothing is really taken away from the songs but if you are a fan, you know the difference.If you like Patti, and you can appreciate a CD of remakes...BUY THIS CD!!!!"
5,Patti does it again,Patti rips through every single one of these covers almost making them her own. I would highly recommend.
1,Very disapointing!!!!,"I love Patti, and her last cd was one of her most consistant to date. This one is not good at all. This a low point in Patti's career, and God knows she has had enough low points on vinyl and disk. Live performances have been consistantly awesome over the years from what I can see on tv. I really wanted to like this, but ""ain't no way"" this song should have been remade by Patti and Mary who has a pitch issue. If you cannot do a song justice, don't sing it!!!!! Patti still has more vocal range left than most of her peers, but singing high notes don't ""make"" a song, interpretation is what makes the listener feel the lyrics. Patti and Mary need to learn that as age will creep up and lower ones vocal register. Patti should have listened to the doctor and waited for this one. This cd came and went, period! I literally gave it away!!!!!!"
2,She has tried....her best !,"She has tried her best and I admire her for the effort.She sings with her heart , but ...I like some of her old stuff.If you like her , you should listen to another great Lady who is the only one who can match her nowadays , Regina Belle.Try her latest release,""Lazy Afternoon"",and then let me know :-)"
5,One of her best.....,"Patti may have had some missteps lateley with the Timeless Journey album being just so-so, but this album brings back the Patti that we know and love. Not all of the songs are winners but certainly enough of them are. It really shows off her range too with some quiet ballads as well as some well done (and over the top) classic soul renditions."
4,Aquage Finishing Spray,This is good hair spray which is not tacky. You can use us this spray every day and it will not get sticky like some other hair sprays. Would recommend it to my friends.
2,Decent but drags after a while,"MaC is a series of case-studies looking at the migratory patterns and experiences of several different ethnic/national groups. Sometiems referred to a Cliomatrics, this approach to history relies heavily on statistics and, while informative, does lend itself to a dry read. I had thought that this was going to be more of a macro- and analytical work. Oh well.MaC isn't bad but I think it's appeal is limited. I got about 75% through before I lost interest; the same trends occur within each group so it was getting rather redundant. I would have given in 3 stars but I just got bored.Not bad but not recommended."
3,Much missing from this otherwise excellent book.,"While Sowell does an outstanding job with the material he includes in this book, he has excluded key material. I fail to understand how anyone could write a book about migrations and culture without including a chapter on the nineteenth century emigrations of Irish Famine victims to America and Australia with the attendent impact on the cultural mores of both countries. Not only does Sowell not include a chapter on this major historical event, there are only a handful of references to the Irish in the book at all! Readers of Migrations and Cultures should proceed with the caveat that Sowell's treatment is less than thorough."
3,It was a decent effort-- if a bit corny,"And I guess if you are English/ Scottish, then this makes sense to you. But how many American people can imagine some police going in to a drug raid and an unarmed police officer chasing a suspect carrying a 9mm and physically pushing him to the ground- and that being enough to bring the suspect in?That one scene took the movie down about a star.The other problem is that the suspense was drawn out a bit too much. Did it really take that long for the characters to reveal their secrets?It is worth watching once, but not twice. Worth buying secondhand or renting for an evening, but NOT new."
5,Beautiful,"I'm knocked off my feet by Ethan Walker's Soft Shining Moon. The poems are often playful, often sweet, occasionally bitter (like life), sometimes a tad preachy, and sometimes brilliant. In any case, they do for me exactly what the author set out to do: to kindle within me a passionate love and desire for the Divine Mother of the universe. When I read it I feel Shiva himself dancing in my heart, bursting the confines of my mundane consciousness with longing for union with Her. I should add that this is no slender volume of verse: no less than 230 poems, all in Her honour! Thank you Ethan: writing this was (to switch religious languages) oy such a mitzvah."
1,dont waste your money,i have never seen anything so pathetic in my life. these 2 fools have never heard of transfering their weight my grandmother of 70 could dance better salsa. take my advice stay away from this video buy any of josie neglia and you wont be let down she is fantastic
2,Space saver,"I bought it as a space saver option for my pantry, but overall, was disappointed. It fits one slice of bread for toasting and not even a regular sized pizza slice. If space is premium, this is not a bad option. Coffeemaker did a decent job making coffee. Best for dorms, studios etc."
1,Fell apart after one month,"Cheap product. Knob on bottom of coffee basket broke within a month. I tried to contact company, but got no response. Without contact from bottom knob, coffeemaker does not work at all. Piece of junk! Irresponsible manufacturer does not respond to complaint. What a waste of money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,Please do not buy this product anywhere. It's not worth $5...so forget about spending $69.99. Coffee filter falls apart everytime and doesn't heat up at all...not even after immediate brewing. Does not toast anything crispy at all.I bought hash browns from dunkin donuts which are crisp as always. By evening I just wanted to reheat and make them crisp...but were soggy and wasted. Didn't even warm up atleast. I wonder how it can toast items taken out from refrigerator when it cannot toast the ones at room temperature.Putting this item on craigs list for $ 20 or $30. Loss is better than frustration. Not even single star rated.
4,for my step-father,I'm sure in the office he will like it but will probably drain alot of power and dont be surprises if it craps out on you after a year
1,Dull and obvious,"I found this an extremely dull and stilted story with no sense of humour or appreciation of a child's wit at all. It read like a school book with its clinical political correctness. If you're looking for a picture book about divorce for young kids I would recommend a book like Babette Cole's The Un-Wedding (also published as ""Two of Everything"") or Emily Haughton's Rainy Day. Cole's book is full of humour and yet deals with serious issues - my 4 y.o. wanted me to read it for her again and again in the months after the separation. Haughton's book is more dreamy and has a double meaning that appeals more to me than to my 4 y.o. but has a far higher quality than this book."
2,So depressing!!!,"I guess the point of this book was to get kids to identify with the lead character, know that their feelings around divorce are not unique, and help them to discuss how they are feeling. While it may succeed in those aims (if those were the aims), it manages to paint a rather bleak and depressing picture, and just made our family feel sad with very little positive to focus on. To give you an idea, the final words of the book are: ""My mommy and my daddy love me too. Just not together."""
4,SILVERWING,"Silverwing was an excellent story. It was action packed, sad, surprising, and so much more. Out of all the books that I have read it would have to be on my top ten books, because I really like how the beginning of this book starts with just one lonely bat trying to find some food in the middle of the night. This book wanted me to read more from the very first page. I would love to read to sequel to this book called Sunwing. This book really caught my attention just from the cover. But over all this has got to be my favorite book my Kenneth Oppel by far. This book makes you feel like you are Shade the main character. When he is just flying around in the dark nighttime. Or when some of the bullies are making fun of him."
5,One of my favorite books!,"There are so many good things I can say about Silverwing. First of all, the book is so descriptive that you actually feel like you are there, living the story along with the characters. The author also describes the characters' feelings so well, it seems as though they are real. It is very realistic. He obviously researched bats quite a bit, and it shows throughout his writing! The characters are all very likable, and the bad guys are nothing short of bad! This book is one of a kind. How many books are out there about bats? Only a few, and even less of those are actually worth reading. I've read this book several times and I am always so captivated by it! It's like a brand new story each time...as you can tell, I highly recommend this book!"
3,My Summary,"RECOMMENDATIONI recommend this book to everyone that is 10 years and older. This book is very well written and suspenseful. In one part when Goth is chasing Shade. Shade says,"" I see you"" then Shade sees Goth and runs. It also has a lot of action like the second part he fights the owl. Shade sees it and he screamed "" This time you will die."" So he went up to it and killed it. If you like action and suspense read this book."
5,Really good book.,It is a good book. My Mom gave it to me and I didn't have any idea what it was about so I read it and I really liked it. It's a book about a silverwing bat named Shade who was migrating and got blown away in a storm from the rest of the colony and was trying to get back to the place where the colony was migrating. The book was exciting and it is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. Nick. I am nine years old P.S. my mom typed this for me I told her what to say
5,READ IT!,"You better read this book. It is one of the best I have everread. It is a story of a lost Silverwing named Shade. Packed withadventure and suspense it is a 'can not put down' book. Coming from a young, clever, exciting author, it is a gret book. How many times do I have to say it?"
5,Gripping,"The ~BEST~ book i have ever read, it is simply amazing! I couldn't put it down, and was hooked by the first page. Your heart leaps as this dramatic book takes you on a roller coaster ride that you will never forget. I recommend for all ages!"
5,Worth it's weight in silver,This book is about a runt in the colony of silverwing bats and whilst migrating to hybernaculum Shade gets lost the next morning he finds himself on this island where a typical 'hard' girl who's lived by herself her whole life shows up they are on a mission to catch up with the colony of bats and to see if they'll accept maria (the female bat)a home with the colony but lust to make it interesting they meet some cannibal bats who pretend to be their friend (maria finds out otherwise). ....
3,a good book,I want very badly to give this book a 5 star but i just can't do that. silverwing is a very good book and i still like to read it some timesbut you get bored of it. but i strongly reccomend you read this and also try the warriors series.
3,A silver medal 4 silverwing!,"The sroty is about a determined bat who has a sunnden urge to see the sun, after being persued by a flock of owls they burn down the ancient nursery. So the flcok is forced to leave for tree heaven to Hhibernauclam. Then a storm seperates shade form his family of bats. He encounters many obsticals and meets some unexpected poeple! this book is ok, not the best ive ever read! but you should read it if you like adventures!"
2,Ok story...,"This was a good story, but a little bland for a little one. Not what I expected. Good illustrations."
1,A very disappointing collection,"As a complete collection, I thought this would be a great set of DVDs to complement my class. Not at all. The instruction is not filmed well and sadly the male instructor doesn't cover the moves particularly well. Additionally,if you are a woman hoping to use this set, don't even try. The woman in the videos simply smiles her way through each lesson, never saying a word and there is no passion or flair in the very limited full shines. It was so painful to watch that I couldn't stand it past 5 lessons. I browsed the rest hoping to see an improvement and ended up throwing the whole set in the trash."
1,my contribution to the dancing community,"After watching these dvds i just wanted to forget that i made such a horrible mistake buying them. I guess when you have no idea about dancing you might find them interesting. The dancers are so bad, the moves so basic and their style...what style? The production is bad the dialogues even worst...with repeated scenes such as ""welcome to a more episode of lets dance salsa"" or ""as we mentioned to a previous episode of lets dance salsa"" or ""if you dont know how to do it buy the previous dvd of lets dance salsa"". As my contribution to the dancing community im writing this review to keep people from waisting their money.Im done."
1,Bad lessons :(,"These is beastly, useless DVDs. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly. They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVDs."
1,Worst Dance Video Ever!,"The video looks like it was made with a $100 budget. It has a horrible and cheap background, and the instructors are very cheesy. Do not dance like these people or you will be laughed out of the salsa club. These instructors give salsa dancers a bad image. I'm an advanced dancer and got nothing out of their advanced videos. The New York salsa videos are excellent, so is a guy named Super Mario for advanced dancers."
1,A Waste Of Money,This collection of CDs should not be sold. They are of no use at all to the dance community. Other than what you dont want to look like or how you dont want to teach. I have competed and taught in dancing This is awful. I could not even watch all of them instead I threw them away.
4,Awesome handheld/phone!,"It is really nice, definitely at least a 4 out of 5 rating....would have been nicer if it was touchscreen, other than that it is lightweight and very useful! I am definitely loving it!"
4,Great phone with one issue,"This is one of the most compact smart phones I have seen, and it is performing marvelously. But, there seems to be an issue with the micro-SD cards. I bought the 2GB card that Amazon ""bundled"" with the phone, but it only worked for a few minutes. Now the phone can't read the content of the card. The HP website is rife with posts to the support forum saying that there seems to be an issue with the card reader, and the only suggestion is to avoid 2GB cards and only use 1GB cards instead. I heartily recommend the phone, but warn potential buyers to do some research before purchasing a memory card for it."
4,pretty good little pda,At first I wasn't sure if this was going to work for me. So small and the t9 thing was crazy to get used to. After a few weeks - I've figured out how to do email alerts and the t9 is great. So I really like it. It's small (compared to my monster ipaq 5315) and portable. Only complaint is custom ringtones are too quiet and i miss calls. Easy to charge (yea no cradle to pack) and so far so good.
4,Nice product for HP,"I read the reviews on this new smartphone and was convinced it would help me out. I did not want to go with a full keyboard like a Blackberry or Treo. It sounded great to get your emails and messages read back to you instead...especially in traffic! However, the voice command needs a little work. I usually have to say a name about 5 or 6 times before it gets it right. Otherwise I love the small size and all the features. Wish they could make it look a little more cool. I had some trouble when I first got it with the volume on the ear piece, but after working out with HPs live chat support everything works great. I also love the new Microsoft 6. I am looking forward to using the internet phone feature to save some minutes on my cell plan. Just remember that the screen is small so if you need glasses-don't get it!"
1,En Venezuela ipaq Hp no funciona,"El teléfono en ocasiones me permite contestar llamadas pero en otras oportunidad no puedo responder, ¿Cuál es el problema? Lo desconozco, al dirigirme a la compañía telefónica ellos me manifestaron que los celulares de dicha casa HP continuamente presentan ese tipo de falla, así que al menos en Venezuela parece que estos ipaq HP no funcionan."
3,I DIDN'T LIKE IT,"I RETURNED THE PHONE AFTER 2 WEEKS, JUST WASN'T GOOD FOR ME. BIGGEST PROBLEMS SMALL SCREEN AND HARD TO OPERATE.... HAD NO PROBLEM RETURNING AND GETTING MY MONEY BACK FROM AMAZON, GREAT COMPANY...."
4,Speedy Delivery,Awesome product. I was amazed by how quickly it arrived and it came with free shipping! I love my phone and would recommend seller...
2,hard to use,buttons too small to use. coverage is not even average.trying to get wifi running a pain.instruction manual gives little instructions.configuration guide difficult.i got took...
1,Very Small,"I bought this product to use it with my VOIP service. I tested it with 3 different providers, and only 1 worked. According to HP support, my VOIP service providers were ""not compatible"" with this phone.The provider that did work, cut the call every 1 min, thus making it impossible for a conversation.If you need this phone for VOIP, forget it!The browser is ok, supports AJAX, but... the screen is very small. You have to scroll right to see the other 70% of the screen.I will not recommend this one."
2,"Stats look good, usage, not so good.","I had two of these and returned them both. The first one wouldn't recognize my SIM. The second one, after getting to use it, was just not to my taste.I've owned Windows Mobile devices before, and loved Blackberry and my personal line iPhone. After the iPhone this screen was so small I'd almost rather it had no screen.The GUI was slow, and way too cramped to be useful/functional on such a small screen. I am usually ok with small buttons, but the buttons were also too small.I honestly didn't even keep it long enough to know how the voice and reception were. I rarely talk on phones anyway, mainly using them as data devices.If this phone were a flip open with a full keypad, I might reconsider the concept. Otherwise, pretty unhappy with the overall usability/functionality for the price compared to other options on the market for the same or less cost."
2,Syncing w/exchange server,"I had problems with syncing to an exchange server, called HP and their reply (from Ferhat S) was:'HP has very limitged support syncing with an exchange server...HP is not supporting syncing with an exchange server'Be aware.HP iPAQ 510 Voice Messenger - Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.0 - OMAP850 200 MHz - RAM: 64 MB - ROM: 128 MB 2"" TFT ( 176 x 220 ) - camera - Bluetooth, 802.11b, 802.11g - GSM 850/900/1800/1900"
2,HP iPaq 510,The cell phone is way too complicated to use. I prefer the Motorola versions much better and am very happy with my Z3 slider.
3,Review Hp ipaque 510,"The Hp Ipaque 510 is a mid range product with enhanced voice capabilities. The resolution of the camera is a bit of a turn off at 1.3 megapixels and the the phone can be really irritating at times when it doesnt act as expected when you try to enter some voice commands. Overall though, it is a good phone since it has a range of features such as windows mobile six, microsoft mobile office (with word which supports edit mode), windows media player and up to 2Gig storage on a mini-sd card."
4,Works Great...small buttons,"Works great for the price. No problems with it. Does fine internationally with different SIM cards.It's part of the long link between a normal cell phone and a ""smartphone""....painful to text with the numeric pad, but runs Windows.Good value for the money."
5,Great assessory for dwarf hamsters,"This is one of the neatest small pet assessories I have seen. It will fit in most cages, the exceptions being the Habitrail pad and Crittertrail mini cages. I have three dwarf hamsters and they all like it a lot."
2,Not so great,"I think Brust is a charming and subtle writer (a rare quality in sci-fi). Unfortunately, this book is really not that interesting. It lacks the emotional depth and complex plotting of the Vlad Taltos books, settling for basically flat characters and an uninvolving march through an uneventful plot. The humor, while present, is pretty thin, and lacks the edge of his other work. Read his other books"
3,Get to The Point!,"This is my first book I have read of Steven Brust. Some people say he is good, others think he is not. I am one of those people that think he is just an ok author. This book was bad and good in diffrent ways. The good points are the story was interesting. I liked the end especialy because it had a great suprise to me. The bad points were Steven Brust would be just going fine along in the story and all of sudden he would start talking about nothing forever and you wish he would just back to the story. The characters dialogue was frustrating too. But in the end I wasn't to upset reading this book. It actualy was a great story. But unless you can put up with Steven Brust continuing talking about nothing for awhile that has nothing to do with the story in some parts I advise you not to read this book."
2,"If I'd wanted to read Dumas, I'd have read Dumas","I had to put the book down after a couple of chapters. Some people are saying ""homage"", I think a more appropriate word is plagarism. I think the idea of a 'novel' is that it should be new. This book really insults the reader and what's worse, it sucked compared to Dumas' Three Muskateers.Unoriginal, insulting, insipid lack of imagination. Plagarism."
1,Hard to read.,"All I have to say about this book is that the dialog is RIDICULOUS. I laugh when I read that Brust is a genius at dialog? I guess the characters just talk weird on his world but really thats what made me hate the book.It was so frustrating to read I didn't finish it. I later read that he was making an ode to three musketeers. It doesn't change the fact that it makes it hard to read.He does do a good job describing action, and in fact I loved his descriptive abilities and world building but his characters speak like they have mental illness! I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes before throwing this book at the wall."
1,In What Alternate Reality is This a Good Book???,"I have never written a negative book review. I love reading, read a book a week and can safely say I have never read something so pretentious. I couldn't make it past 40 pages (made me break my 'give a book 50 pages' rule). Imagine a stuffy old college English professor, someone who loves nothing more than the sound of his own voice, then imagine said professor writing an epic Fantasy and that is what you have here. The narration reads like bad stage directions to the reader. Seriously, how in god's name did the editor sign off on this narrative voice??? ""Hey, I have an idea, write in a narrative style that is as slow and dry as possible with plenty of invisible wall references to the story, our story so far, the reader, readers of the story, etc. etc.""I literally threw this book across the room. To call this an awful book is disrespectful to all the awful books out there."
2,Image preview is misleading,"I bought this harp more for its unusual shape. Upon arrival I was very dissappointed to find that it has no unusual shape, and looks much like any other harp sold on amazon for a lower price. Although it has good sound and quick response it IS NOT anything unusual and the same thing can be purchased at Cracker Barrel for a much cheaper price. Extremly disappointed. I will be making a phone call to the company as soon as the morning comes."
1,Alarm????,I set the clock every night and and it has yet to go off. Sometimes when I look at the time it is off by hours. I believe this product is going back for a refund.
1,Disappointed,"The clock was intended as a gift for my 91-year old father, who lives in Georgia. Unfortunately the clock doesn't work correctly: it does not adjust the time automatically on radio signal. As I live in Germany and my father is not out and about, it is not possible to figure out why the clock is not working or return it to the factory for a refund."
5,An enduring homage to the grizzly bear,"Originally published in 1955, The Beast That Walks Like Man: The Story Of The Grizzly Bear is an enduring homage to the grizzly bear, and ranges from their role in Native American myths; to their first scientific classification in 1815; to their near-extinction in the lower forty-eight states. Informatively written by skilled hunter and wildlife expert Harold McCracken, (who once brought down a grizzly bear himself yet came to respect and admire these animals, as well as mourn the modern day threat of habitat destruction that may yet cause their end), The Beast That Walks Like Man is a very highly addition to Wildlife Studies reference collections."
4,One of the best,This exercise video is the best I have seen or used. My spouse and I both use the program and it is great for flexibility and stamina. I use a different program for cardio.
1,poor translation,Translation is very poor. I bought the book with the hopes to enjoy it and was not able to. I've read the book in English and it was still hard to get through the Spanish translation. At one point in the first few pages of the book there is even missing lines from the original work that did not make it to the Spanish translation.The book is a masterpiece but the translated copy a disgrace.
1,Panasonic NEVER again,"Door BLEW OPEN on my Panasonic microwave while using it! Called Panasonic and right away they had me talk to their lawyer. All he cared about was getting the microwave in their possession (maybe getting rid of evidence?). When I asked about getting it replaced, they said after they had it and checked it out, they would let me know. How do they expect me to be without a microwave over for 2 weeks? 4 weeks? When I said I couldn't wait that long, since I have to feed my family, the lawyer said that is the legal agreement I consented to by buying the oven. My only solution is to buy a another microwave. I feel like a fool for buying a Panasonic. Never again."
5,Excellent translation of Tanakh,This book is beautifully made. The type is easy to read and I love having the original Hebrew text on one side of the page and English on the other side. I am studying the Hebrew language so it is a great reference for that also. I recommend this book for any serious Bible students. You do not need to be able to read Hebrew for it to be a useful resource.
5,New JPS Tanakh,"In a recent move from Mt Vernon, NY to Seattle, WA, I realized while shelving the few books I had taken, I lacked a modern Tanakh. As a retired librarian, and as the niece of Max L. Margolis who was editor-in-chief of the famous 1917 translation, I was fully cognizant of its merits and would never discard it; however, I needed a contemporary Tanakh with both Hebrew-English translation in modern language that was easier to read than the now antiquated but still relevant older edition. I find the new JPS edition fully fits my needs."
2,too much,"in order to really understand what was going on you need to intently read every single word. There are no solutions for the excercises which i thought were too difficult, and many times the means to find the answer could not be found in the chapter."
1,What????,"Sorry this book is extremely more difficult to read than necessary. It is NOT in plain english. If you're planning on buying this book be sure to brush up on some algebra before you even think of picking up this book, as without it even the first few exercises will leave you in a stupor."
1,Great book...if you're a Rocket Scientist,"I thought this book was yet Another ""Too-Technical"" C Book that was made no effort in explaining concepts in plain english. The content was just too much too fast. And WAY too much algebra. Good luck with the exercizes, they're *impossible* (Check out page 30, problem #5, I was like ""What is he Talking about?!""), and it got worse from there. By the time I got to chapter 6 I got so lost that I completely ""zoned out"" of this book and never picked it up again. I wish I could return it, but it is a nice book to rest my coffee cups on.I really thought that this made zero effort at humor or easy learning, or even plain english (like it said it would in chapter 1).The best book for newbies (with the worst title) is ""C for Dummies"" by Dan Gookin (Check out the reviews here on Amazon.com). C for Dummies holds your hand every step of the way and makes it easy and fun to learn advanced topics."
4,Complete C text for experienced programmers.,"I took about a week to finish reading this book. It's not very easy to understand. If you have programming experience, it will not be hard for you at all. The drawback of this book is lack of examples. The author just keep talking and talking. The examples are very important for beginners. Overall, it's a good book."
2,Not for beginners,This book claims that it caters for beginners. I don't think so! It's only of any good to those that are already familiar with programming or another programming language. The language used is arcane at times that only people with previous programming knowledge would understand and benefit from this book. Its exercises are also pointless since there are no answers given. I recommend C by example for beginners which assumes nothing. Its excellent book for beginners.
5,A Good Presentation!,"This book is really good for the beginners. It presents and explains the programming concepts clearly. The length of each chapter is about 20 to 30 pages, which is ideal for me. Usually, one chapter in other programming textbooks will cover 40 pages, which is too long for my brain to function. Buy it, and you will not regret for it!"
3,A required textbook,"A few years ago, I took a Linux systems programming course . We never looked at this book . Personally, I'd recommend something like the old O'Reilly Unix Systems Programming for SVR4 ."
5,Family Values,"A Treasure of a book for anyone seeking old time family values. As a white woman, soon divorced with young adult children I have at times doubted some of my family choices because of my white-bred ways.(""Kick them out when they turn 18"") My intuition has led me on the right pathway with my family. What a joy/wopila to read the Truth of a Woman's life and see in her words and life deeds that the family AND extended famlily are indeed important and should be the mainstay of our life. Pilamiya/Thankyou Beautiful Woman for sharing your life and family."
5,One of the best books in Molecular Quantitative Genetics,"The book discuses quantitative and population genetics on the bases of molecular level. It is very useful for genetic analysis across many disciplines, including plant and animal breeding, and human genetics. It provides useful explanations of some complex biometrical concepts."
5,A spetacular book,That is one of the big book in this area. That book is spetacular and very simple to understand.
1,statsitical genetics,"There are many basic errors in statistics in this book, such as the concepts of expected value and degrees of freedom. The statistical background of the author should be very weak. From the bibliography (how many publications does the author have?) we can see whether the author is well prepared to write this kind of book. Did Dr. Ron Sederoff who wrote the foreword read the book thoroughly? If so, he should have pointed out those very obvious errors. Of course, Dr. Sederoff should not be responsible for those errors if he has no background in Statistics. I hope the author can check the book thoroughly before it goes to the fourth printing or just withdraw it from the publisher."
1,ugh,"This has got to be the worst textbook I have ever had. There is almost no English translation and it assumes the reader already knows whats going on. Trato Hecho is a much better book for learning Spanish, it covers everything clearly and with plenty of translations to help."
3,OK quality but breaks too quickly,"I was fine with the picture quality and print speed although the colors sometimes looked too intense. My gripe is that the printer stopped working before I could even reach 100 pictures. I've read online comments from others with the same problem of sections of the photo coming out white/blank. I've tried cleaning the print head, checking for visible loose/broken parts, and replacing the ink cartridge and paper several times to no avail. It's past the 1 yr warranty, so it'll be going out in my trash soon."
5,"I LOVE IT, GREAT ITEM","I've had this printer for 3 years and use it all the time. I've had no problems with it and it still prints wonderful pictures. The only down side is that when I purchase the 40 picture pack, I usually have 1 picture paper left and I run out of ink, so I don't get my 40 prints, but the quality is so good that I like them better than if I go to CVS OR WAL MART."
5,Love this printer!,The cost of the paper and toner is quite high though! I do not understand why all of the paper sizes are not available in all areas either!
5,Packed with tips and advice for novice channelers.,"Lita de Alberdi's Channeling provides an essential 'how to' title for those who would channel spirits - one of the few books to teach the art of channeling. From working with guides and using psychic protection to conducting channeled readings, this is packed with tips."
5,Delightful,This is book was a very fun and informative read. It talks about the rights and responsiblities of the Top and what it is like to be a top. It tells you that Tops and bottoms are equals. I really enjoyed the chapter on the spiritual side of SM. I highly reccomend this one.
4,Swim suit,"At first the suit surprised me because of the sheen. my other black suit is a flat black this has a shine to it - not bad, just different. the suit is easy to get into and fits well. Unfortunately it doesn't make me look like Dara Torres! I guess that is my job :)"
3,Good stuff if you like Swedish police dramas set on islands,"Nice big English subtitles on this baby. My wife watches these while I try to fall asleep. The sound of people talking Swedish is very soothing. And the island scenery, which I catch about five minutes of each night before dreamland, is really stunning. Just like one of those English PBS series, only Swedish."
2,"Good video, poor disk quality","These Families of the World videos are great, educational tools. However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs. My copy of Puerto Rico families was only played 2x. When I went to clean the disk it cracked down the middle. I looked at the back and the disk quality is that of a burned disk copy, not the professional grade you expect from a DVD purchase."
4,"Loving trip to Yiddishland, Wish You Were Here","This is a great idea for a book and a great gift. For some months, I have trolled through ebay and Amazon auctions, clicking on but never buying copies of old standard and Jewish postcards. The co-author of this book has one of the largest archives of Jewish postcards and images, and he has compiled them into this amazing collection of old Shtetl and Jewish life postcards. They provide the reader with an glimpse of what the Yiddish world was like and what images people wanted to retain. In the words of Gerard Silvain, ""Collecting of postcards has become the second largest type of collection in the world...More moving than any other type of collection for the Jew in search of his roots, the postcard collection is still little known by the general public."
5,A marvelous book,I finally found this book at a reasonable price from this seller. It is an excellent book--a visual record of lost people. Delivery was prompt and the book was in the condition described. I would be happy to buy from this dealer again.
2,Boring - good only for little kids,"Boring, involving, short story. Small children might enjoy it, but I would be surprised if adults actually enjoyed it. If you don't have kids, I would advise renting it rather than buying it. Blu-ray looked good, but that is the only think=g it had going for it."
3,disappointed,"I was so excited to buy this DVD for my 2 year old grandson. We especially enjoyed ""The Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh"", the friendship edition. We also loved Disney's, ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"". However, this movie has more violence in it. Some of the characters hit each other, and are critical of each other instead of the old Pooh stories, where the characters support each other and are gentle with each other. It also moves much faster than those of the past. The other disappointment was that the new voice of Christopher Robin is the same as ""Lumpy"" in ""Poohs Heffalump Movie""."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"My wife and I are expecting our first child and we loved Winnie the Pooh when we were kids. Well we purchased this movie because we thought it was a remastered version of the old one. It is NOT. The movie was good but it just wasn't the old movie, the things that we loved and were quoted as kids have been removed for this new film. All in all it is a good show but its not the original."
3,pooh mailing,"I do not know about the movie as it is a christmas present to my grandchildren, so I cannot give it stars ratings.Hopefully, it will be fine and play well.Amazon is an excellent source for a lot of items I purchase and have been very satisfied with them and their customer service."
5,"Adorable, wholesome, witty!","This movie is everything Winnie the Pooh should be--entertaining, funny, and innocent. I recommend it without hesitation for ALL ages."
4,great movie,"The kids loved it and it gave them a few hours of entertainment. If you child loves Winnie the Pooh, it is an excellent purchase."
3,Different Voices,"The movie was cute but my one disappointment was the different voices. I thought Owl, Eeyore, Rabbit, and Kanga all sound totally different. I did however like that it brought us back to the ""original"" Winnie the Pooh stories/books. Overall a cute movie for the younger kids."
2,A SAD REHASH,"I was so upset when Winnie opened the same day as Harry Potter, so I was anxiously looking forward to the DVD release. For us ""older"" Pooh fans this will be a real disappointment. Most of the story lines we've heard before and there wasn't much effort put into what was there. We've seen some fabulous Pooh adventures in the past but this was pitiful. For very young watchers who only know the one dimension Pooh of the Disney channel, this will be entertaining. But if you expect this to hold the attention of all ages like some of the others, don't waste your money. Just when I thought I might get into it, it was over. I too ""hated"" some of the new voices esp. eeyore. I'm glad Disney hasnt forgotten Pooh, but surely they can do better than this."
5,Winnie the pooh,It is great for my 2 and 4 year olds! We love to watch it as a family movie! Must have
3,"Call me a naturalist, but...","The genius about the original Winnie the Pooh series was the way the creator's captured innocence. The makers of this new film seem to have lost their grasp of this innocence. The character's once cute-little-quirks have become more of a nuisance than lovable idiosyncrasies. I do love Rabbit's character in this movie- they seemed to have replaced the ""angry hare"" with a more supportive, encouraging, and motivational friend. However, Piglet's character wasn't so much timid as it was pathetic. Eeyore is down right depressed, rather than what used to be just an occasionally pessimistic- baritone. Owl is not just smart- he's a pushy know-it-all with a pinch of psychosis. Some points of the movie seemed insulting to the characters. It's a good movie, sure- but I give it three stars because I would have liked the characters to stay true; and the innocence to have remained.We all have different ideas of what is acceptable, so rent before you buy."
5,Grandson's favorite.,"Purchased for my 2yr. old grandson and when he opened it, the family had to watch it right them!! I thihk he liked it."
5,New Pooh,"The 2011 Winnie the Pooh release is fun and exciting but the humor is different from the 2002? release. Some of the jokes seem aimed at an older child - word puns, play on words, etc. Watch it through the end (after the credits) - especially if you're Californian or watch CA public TV. See if you can recognize the voice of the Baksun! Didn't appreciate the ads and the attempts to cross-sell. That was a bit much so fast forward, fast forward or skip."
5,darling movie,"We just love this adorable Pooh movie at our house. My kids love the characters and story, and I love that's it's a completely innocent movie for their young ages."
4,Cute Movie but Very Short,"We picked this blu-ray up for our 3-year old son for Christmas as he loves his Disney movies. Although this is his first non-Pixar movie, he absolutely loves it, especially the songs included. He is up and dancing around from intro to end of credits.The only complaint I have (and reason for 4 stars) is the move is only 62 minutes long. My wife and I could not believe this was an acceptable length to be considered a full length movie that went to theatres but I guess it was."
2,sorry to go against the grain here,I grew up with the many adventures of winnie the pooh and got this as a cheaper alternative. It is so annoying I could not stand to watch it. The first part is a past paced remix of the many adventures of winnie the pooh only the songs are wretched and not the least bit enjoyable.
4,"Watched in the theater, my young children loved it, I guess that is what matters","We took our two oldest children to see this movie in the theater. They are 4 and 2. They really enjoyed it. I have this movie on pre-order because of that fact. But it quite possibly is the most boring movie I have ever seen. And I LOVE watching documentaries and educational movies, Disney Oceans, and March of the Penguins fascinated me. But this was just too much. I also zone out when I watch TV, I get so into it, but I was counting ceiling tiles in the theater with this one. Thankfully it was blessedly short, under an hour. Perfect for the younger crowd, but you have to be pretty nostalgic to be able to watch this more than once as an adult. Hopefully it still keeps their attention when it arrives, and wasn't just the novelty of going to the theater that captivated them."
1,yay? i don't think so,all right now my little sister laurel forced my to see it and it was wishy i thought this would be good but boy was i wrong it is only good for 3 year olds pooh and tigger said good for you wishy to eeyore fortunately i am not anymore i am 12 4 days away from 13 it was 10 years ago with wishyness it looked like a kindergartener and a 3rd grader made this movie this is just crazy and ridiculous with very wishy words i am not going to see it again nor buy it on dvd it deserves negative 100000000000000000000000 stars i'd suggest the smurfs or justin bieber never say never shame on jim cummings
1,Boring no lol only good for toddlers,i am a fan of disney movies but wow this is really wishy and plus a kindergartner made this movie it had no comedy (no lol) no action (no flare)no fun (no hip hip hooray) none at all tigger and eeyore said good for you wishy to piglet laurel forced me to see it 5 minutes later i was ready to leave the theater just stick to justin bieber never say neveroverall 0.0 out of 5 starsshame on jim cummings
5,Great family fun!,"We love this movie. It's a great family film, complete with a wonderful soundtrack, that is entertaining for the kids and adults. Like always, the cast is clever and dialogue witty but not so much so as to leave the little ones in the dark."
4,entertaining,Bought this as a Christmas recommandation by my sister for her toddler kids. They seem to have great fun watching.
3,OK,"I bought the 5 inch version along with the Exo Terra 5.0 light to use in a hermit ""crabitat"". The day light feature works fine but the night time ""glow"" is due to the coating on the inside of the lamp reacting to the light, like glow in the dark stickers, so the effect wears off after a few minutes. I was hoping it was something that was going to stay on all night. But knowing that, I would buy it again anyway."
5,I Love Coloretto,"This is a great game . . . it's easy to learn, and small enough to take ANYWHERE. The only downfall is that you need a minimum of 3 players. I'm hooked!!"
5,What are you gonna do?!,We bought this game for my mom. We've owned it ourselves for a little over a year. This one is nice because it has alternate rules for 2 players (which we didn't try yet) and an alternate scoring system.It's an easy fun game.
2,Compelling Reading For All Seasons.,"Grisham does it again. A great story but not a great writer, he manages to create suspense and intrigue in his own personal manner. And the best part is that you can read it in a weekend."
1,Old stock accumulator made in West Germany,"The accumulators available here are old stock items made in West Germany and are over 20 years old. According to automotive engineers, the shelf life for this part is only 10 years, so they fail quickly.You get what you pay for, and this is an example of a part far past its life expectancy."
5,1992 SAAB 9000 replacement ACDelco Pressure Accumulator,"First, I carefully removed the valve from the original pressure accumulator and placed it into this new accumulator. Then, I installed the ACDelco on my 1992 SAAB 9000 ABS Mark II system. It worked perfectly and has plenty of reserve pumps on the ABS with the power off. I glad that I gave it a try after reading all the other reviews. I saved a bundle on the item. The item was packed well and shipped quickly."
3,Grain of Salt,"Please take this with a grain of salt as I am receiving it from a forum of knowledgeable mechanics. It has been stated that these accumulators are 'new old stock' meaning that they are in fact new but are twenty years old. The accumulator, it is said, have a rubber bladder, this I know for fact as I cut my old one in half to see, and that an inert gas is on the top side thereby providing the needed pressure 'accumulation'. The problem with the twenty year old part is the inert gas has seeped over the twenty years through the rubber bladder and are not able to provide the designed pressure accumulation. I have noticed a decline in the performance of this newly acquired part over the last few months of operation. It is still MUCH better than the old part I replaced, but one might be better off buying a newer NOS part from a reputable dealer/supplier."
5,The Ties that Bind Us,"This is a story of two boys who grow up with the authority of a Presbyterian Minister. They were given the same instruction as children growing up and turned out so different. One was a daredevil determined to challenge the world. The other became a writer and reflective. The two of them could not have been any different.This novel shares how each of us have a built in path that has to be followed. It is the destiny of us all to fulfill and express our own uniqueness in the world. And yet, there was a tie that bound the two of these boys beyond their family ties. Both of them loved to fish. It was the one thing they loved to do together.This bond created a depth to their relationship enabeling a love that was unconditional in nature and allowed their different natures to blend into a unity that could not be explained. It could only be lived and expressed through this simple act of creating a world they both could live in ""a river runs through it.""The Path into Healing"
4,A Well-Researched Heart,"This author's gimlet knowledge of himself winds through the book in gem-like paragraphs. It is written in perfect descriptions. It is the glue for his linkages between place and persons.The book is worth reading for its deep but not overwrought feeling, its strong love of a habitat, and it's careful rendering of flaws and the spaces made around them.I finished the book impressed that a place, the right place, can allow you to be more than just broken."
4,"If you can push through the immense amount of fishing detail, the end is truly poetic.","I've been fishing once, if there is one thing more boring than fishing, it's reading about fishing. This book has a lot of snoozery to it because the author goes into some serious descriptive detail about fly fishing. That being said, the narrative does come through mostly well, and then the last two pages blow you away. It is poetry, some of the best, loveliest and ""beautiful"" words in print. Those who read the book know why i put beautiful in quotes."
2,A River Runs Through,I found this very dull and did not keep my interest. I am not an avid fisherman nor anyone in my home. I will try to read it again later.
4,Flows like a MT river,"Parents of an alum made me promise to read this. MacLean has a writing style that flows like the rivers he fished. His stories are very ""real."" The characters are quirky and rough-edged, just like we are. I definitely recommend this book."
5,Fantastic Book Finally on the Kindle!,"I've been in love with fly fishing and reading as long as I can remember. This has been a book, paperback, tattered and falling apart that I always have with me. Being the daughter of a logger and a forest ranger have also brought me to adore the other stories in this book as well. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves the outdoors, non-fiction and fishing. This book is also one of the major reasons I got a Kindle, and I was disappointed to find it wasn't available. I requested it through Amazon, and the Kindle Edition was released the next day!"
4,Worth the wait,"Liked the movie but loved the story. I wish I'd read the story before I saw the movie. That is just the cover story, believe me, the rest of this book is more than worth the price of admission. More than enough variety to keep you turning the pages and regret the arrival at the end of the stories."
2,Not what was expected.,"I was disappointed in this game. I was expecting a large group of slots like we find at casinos. These are all what I call ""garbage slots"" and they are all about alike but not at all of the traditional style machine. They do provide some variety. I have another Masque game entitled just ""Slots"" that has a couple dozen nice machines of the 3 wheel traditional type that I like really well, and was looking for a game with more of that type, but did not get that."
4,Insightful!,"Like many busy people who need to absorb or teach information in a hurry, Stephan Schiffman never met a bullet point he didn't like. Indeed, his staccato chapters depend on them like a fast food meal needs quick hits of French fries. You probably couldn't present a comprehensive sales training course without mentioning Schiffman, who's been a high-profile sales training leader for more than 20 years. Although his advice is as sound as ever, this book has an episodic structure that seems jumpy. However, the book is written for busy sales professionals, and Schiffman's first rule of sales is to know your audience. Sales executives and business travelers will find this an easy, useful read. Because of its business relevance, we heartily recommend this book to trainers, sales managers and those on the front lines looking for ways to make the most of every deal."
5,cromwellian gunfighter,"The story is interesting first of all because it takes a subject which is not dealt with in fiction very often, the Cromwellian regime in Britain, and gives it an unusual twist. Mr Covington knows his history and is able to create a believable background for the protagoist, Denzil Redmond, an embittered and dangerous Cavallier on the losing side after the Civil War. There is little glory in the warfare described here and it is all the more realistic because of that. Particularly harrowing is the part Redmond, and Cromwellian force he ends up joining, play in the genocidal campaign in Ireland. There is a relatively happy ending but the utter ruthlessness of Redmond will leave some readers unsettled. At any rate, the tale is absorbing and well crafted."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Alex is the critical figure in this final conflict (at least in this series) between Heaven and Hell. Can a vampire boy, a vampire hunter, a mystic knight and an Earth Angel stop the forces of darkness, Satan, vampires and other not so fun things?Redemption? Hmm, that would be a clue. That and bigfoot Ramos."
4,Mists,"I saw the movie on TNT. I loved it because it told the Authurian tale from the womens perspective. It had all the scandal,betrayal and love that molds a great movie. The movie inspired me to read the book by Bradlay (which was great also)and look into the pagan rites and rituals. Being from celtic lines it definatley interested me and entertained. KUDOS to TNT for bringing history alive to all"
2,Tremendously disappointing,"I was glad to hear that someone was making a miniseries of this, and Juliana Margulies seemed like an excellent choice for Morgaine. Unfortunately, the finished production did not live up to expectations. The book dealt not only with the legend through the eyes of women, but with the clash of cultures. The movie paid lip service to this theme, but didn't really grapple with adequately. I don't think I watched it all the way through."
1,Embarrassing!,"How a director can take a very good fantasy novel, assemble a superb cast and dumb the production down to the level of the worst WB fantasy programs is beyond me. From the script to the costumes to the poor use of the sets, I was completely embarrassed to be watching this! What a waste! Now I understand why Angelica Houston never really plugged the movie in her interviews, but instead talked about how much her friends loved the book! It really is that bad. Hopefully someone else will undertake this again -- someone who's actually read the book."
3,Good but not good enough for Marion,"As another reviewer said, the Viviane they cast is marvelous as are many of the other actors in portraying their roles. But it is not good enough for the Mists of Avalon written by Marion Zimmer Bradely.The fact they changed the ending is what bothered me most, in the book Igraine dies mid way, she doesn't reunit with her daughter. I also did not like the way they cut out characters like Nimue, who was probably the only strong blonde in the book, and also something quite tragic.Hehe, I also have to say that Viviane is to tall (not that it makes much difference though..)"
1,Do Not Waste Your Time,"If you have read Zimmer's book do not rent, buy or even think about watching this movie. While Angelica Houston and Julianna are two of my favorite actresses, the costumes and sets were beautiful, and the soundtrack was well used, these factors do not make up for the absolute butchery that the producers performed on the Mists of Avalon story.Huge parts of the plot were left out (i.e, Morgaine's visit to the fairy land, I mean, she is called Morgaine of the Fairies). These deficiencies were not made up for in any way. The acting seemed forced and obviously fake at times and I was just confused at times.Then, to make matters worse, the DVD has no explanation whatsoever of why the producers chose this version, or chose to portray the Aurthurian legend in this way.Very, very dissapointing."
5,Sucker for Camelot,"I loved this movie and have not read the books. The acting was superb! It is Camelot from the female characters perspective. Considering it was made for TV (like its Merlin counterpart) I find I am enjoying great productions made for TV better than Hollywood's blockbusters. Go figure. For a really enjoyable time, watch both Merlin and Mists. You will get a two sided approach to the same story."
2,where's the complexity?,"i felt that this version of ""mists of avalon,"" one of my favorite books, lacked so much of the complexity that the original text held. the book was very careful to blur the line between good and evil, yet the movie ignored that concept entirely, clearly labeling the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys."" i felt that the miniseries only scratched the surface of the plot, leaving out many deeper aspects of the story. if you have any respect for the book, i do not reccoment this. however, if you are looking for a simple fantasy story, then go ahead."
1,"If you loved the book, don't watch the movie","How excited I was to learn that one of my favorite books was being turned into a movie! And with such talented actors! Then I watched it - and my temper flared. It is one thing to edit a book to make it into a movie, but it is another thing to butcher it. In their attempt to cram the whole novel into a three hour mini-series (4 hours with commericials), the audience is left confused by rushed events and unexplained plots. It would have been better to make it a longer mini-series or feature film so that the true story could be told and that the actors could shine even more."
2,"Great costumes and sets, but.....","Having read the book, Mists of Avalon, I was extremely disappointed that the folks at TNT didn't keep one of the most essential parts of the story intact, that of Morgaine and Arthur knowing each other right after the Beltaine ceremony. The guilt Morgaine feels and the illicit love Arthur feels are part of what drives each of them in the story. The other essential details at the end of the movie that were changed also made the story less than it would have been if left the same as the book.Those folks that do screenplay adaptations from books really need to know their audience before butchering a story like this one. Read the book. Rent the DVD to see the beautiful sets and costumes."
2,disappointing adaption of the novel,"Having loved Mists of Avalon since it was first published, I was interested to watch the TV adaption of the novel. Sadly, I found it to be a disappointing adaption, from the wrong ages of characters (Morgause was about 14 in the beginning of the story she can't possibly be played by a woman almost 50!!!) to tacky looking sets. I kept wondering if I was watching the same basic story.Perhaps had I not read the novel, I would have enjoyed it more, but I would not recommend it to those who were hoping for an adaption more aligned with Zimmer Bradley's original work.On the plus side, I did think that Julianna Margulies was an excellent choice for Morgaine."
3,Entertaining but lacking in some aspects,"I was delighted when I first heard that they were making a movie based on Marion Zimmer Bradley's acclaimed novel. I had read the book and found it delightfully entertaining and would read over and over again. After watching the movie, I found myself disappointed on how they had interpreted the story by leaving key events out. However, Juliana Margulies and Angelica Houston portrayed the characters very well. Other characters could have been better portrayed, not only by the actors but by the script as well. But for what it is, the movie was still entertaining and would recommend that people see this movie, at least once."
3,Good movie bad adaptation,"This is a tough one to rate, it is a good movie, based on a great book. The movie is better than other Arthurian movies, but the adaptation itself is just dissapointing. Angelca Houston's perormance is flawless, and Juliana Margolis is perfect for the roll of Morgaine."
1,Well...,"On it's own, I think it would be a decent movie. However, for people like myself who have read and adored the book, it was a horrible disappointment. It skipped almost everything that is wonderful about the book. At times I found myself wondering if the filmmakers had even read the book. =/"
4,Female version of Excaliber!,"Saw it on TNT awhile back. It's a little slower on the action, but good story telling. If you saw it you know what I mean. It's worth getting if you like the folklore."
1,oh ny God!!! This movie sucks!!!,"If you love the book or waited to watch this until after you read th final chapter, this movie will be a big, huge diappointment. I rented it based on reviews found here. Within the first 5 to 10 minutes it breaks from the book. To me it seemed that the only thing that they kept from the book were names and places. The dialog and backgroung were made up!I don'trecommend watching this unless you plan to do so before you read the book. Then you can (maybe) enjoy the movie."
2,Shameful & Dissapointing,"I have read the book so many countless times and loved it that I got my hopes up when I heard about the made-for-tv-movie. There are just too many things that were not true to the story it was so so dissapointing. Igraine dies in the book, not a convent and ugh! I could just scream. Maybe its because TNT did it and it just couldn't give the full oohmph that a bigger studio could have, but mostly its just that the book was just a powerful twist on the Aurthurian Legend and the movie just reduces Bradley's beauty to drivel. If she had been alive right now she would've died.I gave it two stars becuase I liked the casting of Juliana Margulies as Morgaine. Even though she wasn't given very much to work with for character development."
1,"If you loved the book, don't watch this movie...","I have read the book so many times, and was so excited when I heard it was being made into a movie. I was also excited about the cast, which was excellent. I couldn't even get through the whole movie - I had to shut off the TV. The Mists of Avalon is a long book - and cuts certainly had to be made - but the movie also cut all of the soul out of the story, and turned it into such a comical shadow of the original. I'm not just a stubborn fan who doesn't want anything changed. This is simply a bad movie.If you are at all passionate about the book, you will be downright angry by this interpretation of it."
3,No magic!,No magic! The prosaic atmosphere clashes with the requirements of the story. Disappointing.
2,i highly recommend the book instead,"The book was absolutely amazing and could not be captured by a movie. All of the magic died after watching the movie. I also would have picked charcters that fit the description in the book. Helena Bonham Carter would have made a great Morgaine. Nicole Kidman a wonderful Morgause. the casting could have been a lot better and so could the diologue. Read the book instead, only then will you really appreciate the story."
1,Marion Zimmer Bradley must be rolling in her grave!,"I watched this on TNT and was fully prepared to love it--I happen to be a big fan of the book series--but talk about disappointing! When the combined talents of Angelica Huston, Joan Allen and Julianna Margulies can't save the film, you've got a real stinker on your hands. Granted that filming the book in anything close to its entirity would've made for a far longer series, there are just some things that if you can't bother to do right, you're better off not beginning--read the book if you want the magic!"
1,"An incestuous, podding mess","It's incest all the way down, folks, and it's nauseating to the core. Good people are manipulated in ways which turn your stomach; not for family viewing. Of course, the Celtic goddess is ""real"" and the Christian God (and his followers) are trash, in this movie, with the usual stereotypes.Not to say the worshipers of the goddess come off any better, what with their prediliction for causing in-family breeding abominations and such, but at least the goddess answers sometimes. It's all about the women in this turgid feminist fantasy.The casting of Lancelot and some other characters - or maybe it's just their costuming and hair - is just terrible and forgettable. The pace is plodding and agonizing. At the end, we're just glad Avalon is finished and done with - at least this version of it."
1,Poor and pitiful attempt at the real thing,"This movie is just a poor representation of the marvelous tales and legends of King Arthur. Not just that, but Quinevere was turned into nothing more than a woman with very few morals. Orgy's run amuck throughout this movie, actually, there's very little here except for the orgy's on the Midsummer night party where especially King Arthur decides he wants Quinevere to sleep with him and Lancelot at the same time. Just because he was afraid it was his fault that the Queen couldn't have children.So. I wouldn't say having the Queen sleep with your best Knight was the way to go. Especially as Quinevere was allegedly supposed to have been burned at the stake for the accusations thrown at her for sleeping with Lancelot. Its horrible the way history will be distorted all for hearthrobs.I could go on and on, but I think its safe to say I've said enough as far as my opinion on this movie goes.Time spent here could be better invested elsewhere."
5,wonderful movie,this movie is great. done very well. If you like the king Arthur period you will love this movie. The book is also good. I could not put it down & it is a very long book. you should get both. I bought the book first. many years ago. would read it every night until I finished it & then when I saw it was a movie bought it.
3,Mists of Avalon movie,"If you watch the movie and do not compare it to the fabulous book by Marion Zimmer-Bradley it is enjoyable. Pretty good for an attempt to create a movie from a much loved tome, I enjoyed it. Great music by Loreena McKennitt!!"
1,Horrible misrepresentation,"Too rich and complicated of a story to be presented on screen, I did not expect to be impressed with this release. However, I was even more disappointed by the gross liberty taken with plot and character. If you are an Avalon fan I suggest passing this one by."
2,A poor rendition of an excellent book,"I was not a huge fan of this production. It reduces the complexity of the book to a minor struggle for revenge, and it is far longer than its quality would dictate. I would recommend reading the book instead of watching the movie."
1,An insult to a classic of fantasy literature,"If you loved this wonderfully written, feminist, intelligent book at all, please don't bother with the mini series. I was absolutely disgusted and appalled at the poorly written adaptation. I screamed and threw things at my TV the entire time. Poor casting, over simpified characters, and the removal of key events and players. Worse of all, the ending. The screenplay was insulting to pagans and christians to boot.If you've never read it, do yourself a favor. Don't buy this tripe, save your money and buy the book instead. You'll like it much more, I promise."
4,"A Satisfactory Adaptation, A Great Movie","WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? The Mists of Avalon was great!! It was a good adaptation, considering that it was already a 3+ hour miniseries, and they couldn't add any more to it, they had to pick and choose-- duh. The actors were dedicated, the story was developed, and the special effects were nice. Sure, certain things were different, like Viviane's death, but it was their decision to change it to make it fit more into the movie, who can blame them??"
1,HORRIBLE,This was a horrible adaptation of a fabulous book. I fear that those who buy the DVD will either be fooled that it represents the story or they will be so turned off... did I mention it was terrible... that they will not read the book. Don't buy this.. don't rent it... read the book.
4,Visually gorgeous tho' story was choppy,"I had first seen this on television and was really surprised at how good it was. Then I decided to buy the dvd years later and watch it again. I had the book for a few years and one day needing something to read there it was. I had a great time reading this. The characters were so full blown and I actually came to care about them. The relationship between Lacelet and Arthur, Guenivere and Morgaine. Sometimes you'd like Morgaine other times not. Morgause was a little more complex. Great fun these women and then there was Kevin who was not in the movie. Such a rich character. All in all a great movie and still greater read. I think of it as a modern day masterpiece."
5,A Fast Moving Shakespearean Epic,"I was expecting this movie to be a boring drama, but instead the story was changing in a big way constantly, and did not dwell on over-emotional reactions. Although strong and irrational feelings are very much a part of this movie, they are shown quickly and as part of the plot. The one thing that I didn't like about this movie was the odd pagan culture of Avalon, which could be a bit over-dramatic and silly at times. Another strange quirk about the story is that there is always a special reason that forces the characters to make love, which seems a bit too fanciful but makes for an interesting plot that is so enjoyably complicated that I consider it close to Shakespeare in greatness. The acting was superb except for the last bad guy, but no big deal.Overall this is a greater movie than I would have ever expected, and it's good for the entire 3 hours."
4,The Mists of Avalon,"I'm not going to draw this out into a long description of what you could find if you just watched it yourself. There are some points that a bit corny, a little too dramatic for what they are, but other than that, I LOVE this movie. I especially love the ending part about the Goddess coming back as the mother of Jesus and the way it was put together. I have great love for the Goddess, so I adored this part. I gave it a four star because of the too-dramatic scenes that shouldn't be.)O("
4,Enjoyable,"Having loved the book I was excited to see this. I was disappointed a little, but I still enjoyed the film. Realizing that books and movies are two different mediums is the key to enjoying this film. Book adaptaions rarely follow the original source mainly because it's a difficult task to do.Still, it's rather fun to watch and a great thing to view before reading the book."
3,Nothing compared to the book,"The movie the Mists of Avalon was not what I expected. I fell in love with the book The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley and it was sad to see that a movie made based on her masterpiece could be so different. The characters, the ending and so many other things were not the same and so many key events were left out. So if you are a true fan of the book this movie is not for you."
1,So disappointing.,"If you didn't read the book you MIGHT be contented with this horribly abridged, watered-down, soap opera version of the story - with its plodding pace, lame-ass Celtic 101 Soundtrack, and the best performances in an uninspired cast delivered by a strangely wooden Julianna with Anjelica obviously phoning it in. Lancelot and Guinevere have absolutely no chemistry, don't seem to even be in love, and the movie's attempts at eroticism are about as hot as a ketchup packet. If you did read the book you'll probably be totally pissed-off about the merciless slashing of the plot that leaves out major themes like the Holy Grail, Kevin, Morgaine's return to Avalon, Accolon's attempt to kill Arthur, etc; as well as softening and glossing over MZB's indictment of Christianity. Thumbs way down."
2,not for children,"there are some seens not suited for children in this movie. i sa the reviews and alomost fell over at how no one tells you that the sister sleeps with her brother and they talk about it through the hole movie, it's not a movie you can skip the bad seen and it still be a good movie."
2,NOT ENOUGH ACTION TO INTRIGUE THE MIND,The movie could have been great if different actors were chosen. The special effects were not that creative.
3,Plot points lost,"I agree with most of the other reviewers here: not enough emotion in the characters, and oversimplification of important plot points. I just wanted to highlight two points: first, the fact that they cut the entire part in the book in which Morgaine rediscovers the Goddess's ways through Accolon is completely unforgivable. Because Morgaine isn't shown coming back to her full strength as a priestess, her entire character suffers. And second (and I'm sure others have pointed this out), what was the deal with the ending?? It changes the entire tone of the story; the entire point of the narrative is lost in the film version.In essence, while this film was not *bad*, it does not qualify for the title of ""adaptation"".Sorry."
1,The Mists of Avalon,"This film adaptation of the book of the same title starts out promisingly enough, but degenerates quickly into a mess of bland characterizations, boring events, sickly dialogue, unwashed hair and tatooed faces. Battle sequences are brief and not very inspiring, and the legends of Arthur are perversely treated despite a promising premise (the tale as seen through the eyes of its female characters). Arthurian legend is much more entertaining in the likewise made-for-television feature, ""Merlin,"" which delivers in all the places that ""The Mists of Avalon"" failed."
4,"man, some people are picky","...This is a fantastic movie. There are indeed slow parts, but the movie makes up for it with the cinematography. The look of the movie is fabulous. The performances are terrific, if sometimes limited by the script, and the amount of story material it had to cover in a relatively brief time. I cannot think of better casting choices. Juliana Margulies is ravishingly beautiful and yet brings a dignity and grace to her role, Joan Allen is appropriately malignant, and Anjelica Huston, well, I was won over by the time she was riding with young Morgaine and explaining to her, ""The Goddess is everywhere..."" Wicca 101 on primetime TV!Forget the nitpickers, folks. This is a WONDERFUL movie. Pick it up."
2,Who wrote the movie? Did they read the book?,"""The Mists of Avalon"" by Marion Zimmer Bradley was one of the best books I have ever read. Sad to say, whoever wrote the script for the movie was not even close. The movie was horribly depicted and poorly interperted from the book. Unstandably so, the book was about 900 pages, but leaving out 60 percent of the characters and having people do things they never did is just poor script. I was so much looking forward to watching this movie after have finishing the book. Sadly I'm really diappointed. It was just poorly depicted from the book. 2 stars here."
1,Read the book first!! Then watch this mini-series.,"I reveived the book for my birthday about a year before this came on TNT, and my friends and I waited in anticipation to watch it. When it was all said and done, the person who set up the story board butchered the story! While the first part is fairly close to the book, the second part was ripped to shreads and clumsily pieced back together leaving huge holes in the story, some of which were necessary to the plot! If you are going to watch this mini-series, read the book first. It is much more enjoyable. On a better note, the costumes and actor choices were great. If only they hadn't messed up the story."
2,Bland on every level,"I read the book almost twenty years ago, but barely remember it. I realize this movie was made for TV, but it is so empty. It looks good enough, but it has no soul. Maybe the novel's length confounded the script, which stifled some usually good actors. Made for TV doesn't have to be this bland."
3,A better book than a movie,I felt that the acting and everything about the movie was very good except for one thing. So much of it was missing. I am a HUGE fan of this book and was sorely disappointed by this movie. In its own its a great film. I just wish that it had followed the book more closely.
4,the best film I have ever read,"in my view it is awonderful film. I have seen it so many times that i even bought the book .it is about magic and how the old religion was transformed in Christianity. but that is only in the backround,"
3,dvd,This was a long movie for me i really couldn't get into this type of movie. I might try and watch it again later
1,Drawing the Mists,"This movie was absolutely the antithesis of everything Bradley wrote in her novel. None of the characters were portrayed accurately and none of the events matched completely with those in the book. Haphazard, the movie is more confusing than ever the closer it comes the the end. Everything become Christian and that is not what happens. Read the book - avoid the movie."
1,Skip the movie. Read the book.,"The only good thing about this movie--and I'm really grasping at straws here--is that it prompted me to reread the book, which I last read over 10 years ago. The book is a breathtaking masterpiece; the movie is a breathtaking travesty. A 10-hour television miniseries might, just might, have pulled it off. A movie, even a 3-hour one, was doomed from the start to do injustice to the book, but it's even worse than that: the plot has been altered enough that the book is nearly unrecognizable within it except in broadest outline. Poor Marion. She deserved much better."
1,"Not tears of Joy, those were TEARS OF HORROR!","There was a reason that they waited until Marion Zimmer Bradley has passed away before they could release this movie. There was also a reason that this movie was released straight to television.This was the WORST REPRESENTATION of a book I have ever had the misfortune to see. Not only did the just casually stray from the original parts, there were moments that that were completely new and in places that never existed in the book at all.It was also insulting to Marion Zimmer Bradley's careful work and passion if you ask me.Please just be contented with the book, and stay as far away from this movie as humanly possible."
2,Disappointing,"The action is good...has a realistic feel to it; not this dancing and prancing around you see in other movies, but real savage hacking -- more like it really was. The sets and scenery are beautiful. The acting is good. But the story is only based on the Arthurian legends...much has been twisted or changed, the most obvious being that it portrays Morgana as the poor girl who is taken advantage of at every turn, though she is in the original (Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur) one of Arthur's main enemies. The story being told from Morgana's perspective would have been a great idea, if she had remained the wicked foe she used to be. It is not really boring, but nevertheless very lacking. I found no moral and nothing inspiring in this rendition of the Arthurian tale."
2,It made me spew blood,"So it didn't really make me spew blood. In fact, I barely remember watching this movie six or so years ago when it came out. I will say this, I did enjoy the jolly time popcorn I ate while watching the flick."
1,"If you loved this book, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!","This movie was awful. It takes a magical book and turns it into a mockery. **Book Spoiler Alert** Arthur doesn't even find out he was with Morgaine at Beltane until the end?! Morgaine is thrilled to see her mother?? Morgause put Mordred out to die in the snow but stopped when Morgaine told her that the baby was Arthur's in her fevered sleep?? Julianna Margulies was cast well although her accent was wretched. Gwenhwyfar was cast way too old and the actress was somewhat haggard. Pretty, but not the extremely frail character she was supposed to be. This movie was a mockery and I am ashamed of the author for allowing this to happen. I guess money is what is most important to some people. If I could have given it no stars, I would have.Ugh. I am offended."
5,Mesmerizing Movie,"A film that will keep you enthralled right from the beginning. Surrounded by magic and mystery, the story will carry us back to a past which remains lost, though deals with very actual issues such as love, loyalty, cruelty and betrayal. It also made me think what if the Saxons would not have succeeded in their conquest of The Briatain Islands...Will we ever overcome this urgent instinct of territoriality, simply grabing disregarding prior rights or occupancy? All this surrounded by this sense of overcoming power by the force of love and spiritual prevalescence untainted by the hand of Man.I just love it!"
4,For what it was...,"First I had to take into consideration that this was a tv movie. I truly wish it had been adapted for a real film and think that would have made a positive difference, but you get what you get....That said, I liked it. No, it was no where as great as the book, but any screen adaptation rarely is. The acting was very good and the casting was acceptable, especially Morgaine and Angelica Houston who was amazing in the part...The story jumped a bit too much and lost a lot from that, but I enjoyed it very much, and in the end that is the most important thing."
2,Definatly resistable,"For those of you who haven't read the books, you may gain some enjoyment from this film. Everyone who loved this movie did not read the book, but for those of us who did, we HATED this film with a passion. It moves quite slow and while I have the utmost respect for each of the actors in this film, the only ones to play their characters even remotly well were Anjelica Huston and Joan Allen playing Vivan and Morgause respectfully. I'm not familiar with Julianna M.'s work, but she was TERRIBLE as Morgaine!! Do yourself a favor, pass on the film. I know the book is massive, but its a fantastic read."
2,Very Disappointing,"Perhaps due to being overly familiar and very fond of the book, I was terribly disappointed in this mini-series. In fact, I found it virtually unwatchable. Although the cast is filled with several fine actors, they are all terrible here. The plot and themes of the book are totally bastardized. Very, very sad."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"I was really excited to see the movie version of one of my favorite book. In the first 5 minutes of the movie I was sorely disappointed. It was horrific. Maybe I was spoiled by Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings movies in that they stuck to the story line. It seemed as if none of the actors read the book before the screenplay. Don't watch it, read the book instead!!!!"
4,A Tale of King Arthur,"The legend of King Arthur is based on a history whose real story has vanished into the mists of time along with the remnants of Celtic civilization and the power of the old gods. This version is beautifully rendered, with esquisite cinematography that hints of the glory of the pre-Christian era in the British isles. It is both a love story and a tragedy, as the pristess of Avalon struggles to preserve the old ways in the face of an agressive new religion. A rousing tale worth watching."
2,"If you read the book, stay far away from this movie!","This would be an ok movie if it was made in its own right, but as an adaptation of the book it it is awful! Elements of the plot are changed and the entire ending has nothing to do with the one in the book. It is pathetic!I can see how someone who hadn't read the book might like this movie, but as someone who loved the book I find this movie horrible.Also this movie is highly offensive in their reprensentation of pagan people. They don't explain any of the rites, so they do not make any sence.In other words, if you read the book stay away!"
4,Good movie,"this was excellently done, with good acting and a great plotline. i think my only problem is that when i first wwatched it, i kept noting all the changes they made to it from the book and which details weren't accurate. and personally, i didn't like the way viviane was depicted in the movie--she seemed way too harsh. but angelica huston played her very well that way so i guess it worked out. the book is still better than the movie, but the movie is certainly worth watching, unless you're one of those people who can't stand to se any changes made in a book-to-movie translation. if you are, good luck in your movie searches. the mists of avalon does a better job in sticking to the boo than most movies do. And if i hadn't been noting all the differences between book and movie, i probably would have given it five stars. Hooray for the wonderful actresses!! they ROCK!!!"
4,Interesting perspective on a classic tale,"It was refreshing to see an epic medieval movie that sheds a femenine perspective on a familiar story. Cinematically it was breathtaking. I wanted to live in Avalon. The actresses were all captivating, especially Anjelica Huston as the priestess Vivienne. I particularly enjoyed the focus on the religion of the Goddess as a generally positive force that (like everything else) was corrupted by those who desired power. Everyone who has read the Arthurian legends or has seen Excalibur should see this for a possible ""other side"" of the story.My one criticism was that the men playing Lancelot and Arthur were too Beverly Hills 90210. Seeing clean-cut Hollywoodish men just pulled me out of the medieval setting. The producers should have found some sexy but swarthy men who didn't detract from the authenticity of a time before electric razors..."
1,"Oh, please","You gotta be kidding me. This is one of my favorite books so cruelly mutilated and disgraced--TNT should be destroyed. Now, the cast was all right--I was impressed with Julianna as Morgained and enthralled with Anjelica as Viviane, etc but what was up with the plot? It's taken so long for a good version of the Arthurian legend to come about, and how do we honor one of the greatest books ever written? We violate it, hack at it, fudge all the scenes and then display it in four miserable hours. I weep for the late and brilliant author, for I know she must be turning violently in her grave."
4,THE WOMEN OF AVALON,"I READ THE BOOK THE MISTS OF AVALON BY MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY YEARS AGO AND LOVED IT. AS IN THE BOOK, ARTHURS LEGEND REVOLVES AROUND THE WOMEN AND INTRIGUE BEHIND THE THRONE. WOMEN IN THIS SERIES ARE THE PRIMARY PLOT, AND DOES A GREAT JOB OF EXPLANING WHAT HAPPENED.THE BOOK WAS AWESOME AND THE SERIES JUST AS GOOD!!(;"
2,"Well cast, poorly written","I was excited about the premiere of this one too, especially when I saw how well-casted it was. Everyone in this two-part miniseries is perfect for the part - except the writers. The first half follows the book reasonably well, with only a few problems. Then there's the second half, which omits every important aspect of the story. Particularly conspicuous is the absence of the Merlin succession story - Kevin Harper isn't even in the film! The old Merlin dies without the slightest inkling of why his character was important. The fairy world is also completely missing. Then there's the ridiculous ending to the Morgause subplot, an idiotic departure from the book. In all, this was a glorious idea, with a promising beginning, that comes crashing down to an ignominious failure."
2,ACK! What have they done! WHERE IS KEVIN?,"When I heard that TNT would be airing a miniseries based on ""The Mists of Avalon,"" I was, to say the least, quite apprehensive. Trying to condense a multi-layered, 876-page book into a three-hour miniseries WITH commercial breaks... it made me nervous. Sadly enough, I was right to be so worried; more so than I had hoped to be. There were many fairly important characters (such as Kevin and Nimue), and, consequently, many relationships left out that had played rather a key role in the story. The entire thing had all the passion and fire of a soap dish, and any ""offensive"" (see ORIGINAL) ideas and/or situations edited out. What a sad disappointment."
2,A Man's Adaptation of a Woman's Story....,"Let me just say, the book is phenomenal, written by a woman, and told from the womens' point of view. The movie, however, was done by a man, and does not remotely do justice for the book. A film would have to be a good twenty hours to even hope to encompass enough of the story to be comprehensive, and needs to be done by a woman so the perspective does not get so skewed as it did in the making of this film. The movie is nothing like the book, and some of the characters could have been cast much better, not to mention the women in the film came across with much less strength in character than in the book. If you look at the movie as a movie by itself with no relation to the book, it is decent, but so much was changed and left out from what is in the book that the film really ends up being a completely different, and deficient, story overall."
2,Nothing like the book.,"I have read Marion Zimmer Bradley's book and this TV production in no way resembles it.Reading the book, I did not envision Igraine as portrayed by Julianna, nor Viviane by Angelica, Guenevere as a bleach-blonde in false eyelashes, nor the women of Avalon with shaved heads and living in castles!Marion's book is far more intricate, earthy and truer to the time in which the story takes place. She weaves a tale about women that is essentially from a woman's point of view.In contrast, this film version makes many changes, with characters, settings, timelines, and is dark in nature and in appearance. Frankly, it was turned into more of a guy flick. I was so disappointed in Part 1, I didn't bother with Part 2.I found the book refreshing and inspiring, so I recommend the book instead, especially if you're a woman."
5,AN INTERESTING TAKE ON THE LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR!,"I had put this off with no sense of urgency in viewing; foolishness on my part. This is a great take on the legend of King Arthur and Camelot, a companion piece with Excalibur. Excellently scripted; beautifully acted! A must see!"
4,Morgan leFay finally tells her side of the story,"Feminine power of the sisters of Avalon dominates this story, and rightly so, since the intention is tell a story otherwise told by men for hundreds of years. Story is organic and as such the essentials of plot can be retold by a teller to effect a different understanding of the way things are. While I have loved the Arthurian tales all my life, and particularly the stories of Malory in all the grand knightly language, I enjoyed delving more deeply into the complex female characters and their struggle to endure. Perhaps it goes a bit farther into more contemporary, conventional understanding of the pagan rituals, stylizing what was probably more raw and barbaric; still, it is a lovely film and worth watching if you enjoy a well-woven tale."
3,Longed for the Movie,"I had read the book, and thoroughly loved it! Heard the movie was coming out and couldn't wait. But it was a let down. If you haven't read the book, the movie is good to see. But if you've read the book, well, the movie was a dissapointment to me."
2,Flawed pearl,"It has good actors, yet it doesn't satisfy.Maybe it is because it was made for TV and not even pay cable. The characters do not match the book.Morgause, for instance, in the book starts off as a teenager, and is married young to Lot of Orkney. In the book she is played by an actress in her thirties. This kills a lot of her motivations.Dissapointing."
5,Such a great movie!,This was a miniseries that was on when I was a girl. It was good then when I was a silly girl with as much attention as a can be expected so young. It was exciting to see that it was just as good as I remember.I'm not a historian so my knowledge of Arthur is limited but I'm sure this sensationalizes the love affair between the characters more then it's said originally. Either way - it's enjoyable for those of you that love visual delight and good acting. You won't be disappointed.
2,Read the book...,"Read the book (it is superb), skip the film. This made for TV effort by TNT has so many departures from the original story it is almost a different tale. In addition, trying to condense 800+ pages into three hours means some serious editing has been done. The result is a choppy difficult to follow film that leaves the viewer disappointed. The book could be remade into an excellent film multi-part film by a good film studio with a good budget and a script that more closely follows the book (like the LOTR films for example)."
5,The best King Arthur tale,I saw this movie about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. Although tragic this is the best King Arthur movie I have ever seen. The female roles throughout the movie are very strong and I felt like I was completely apart of the story. Its amazing and a must see.
5,Great Movie,"I loved this movie, and when i first saw it on TNT i knew i had to buy the DVD when it came out. This movie puts a whole new twist on the Arthurian legends which i find amazingly rare these days. All of the actors and actresses in this movie were phenomenal, and their roles were perfect for them. Even though, like all Arthurian legends, the end is depressing, it was still a really intriguing and inspiring movie."
2,"Entertaining, but not true to the novel...","Granted, jamming 800+ pages into a short television miniseries is a difficult undertaking, but changing the story around altogether is doing it a grave injustice. Part I of this miniseries does a reasonably good job of portraying the first half of the events from the novel, but Part II could have been a different tale entirely. The absence of certain less plot-crucial characters in an epic's transition from page to screen is understandable, but rewriting the course of events is unforgiveable. It's certainly worth watching, but if you have read (and loved) the book, don't expect this to be entirely faithful to it. If you haven't read the book, just be aware that you'd be getting a different story altogether."
2,too much story missing in film,"We need the Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings Trilogy fame, to do this book justice. The Book MISTS OF AVALON was WONDERFUL - this film was chopped up and missing so much that it wasn't really worth watching, in my humble opinion. A waste of wonderful actors, terrible job on screen play. GET PETER JACKSON and his production company busy on this!"
1,"C'mon, people, this movie stunk!","Just a big disappointment. The actresses are all very fine, but the script was horrible and the directing even worse. This movie jumps from scene to scene with hardly anthing to hold it all together. It barely even makes sense, much less draws in the viewer. Of course you should read the book, but that's not the point. This movie is plain horrible, and not because it doesn't compare to the book. It's horrible because it's a mess."
3,i am disapoint,"OK here's the deal. i live right next to the black diamond factory. the item i thought i was buying was supposed to be an out dated bag they no longer make. instead i was sent the same thing that i could have just picked up at the local factory store, or any number of retail stores within 5 miles. UPDATE YOUR IMAGES!!!!!!!!!!! this site is lame, just go to back country .com they know there stuff"
5,Nordic Ware Sunflower Pan,The Nordic Ware Sunflower pan is just what I wanted. It came in perfect condition and in a very timely fashion. Thank you!
3,"ANDRE DE TOTH, OPUS 29",It's propaganda all right but filmed with class by André de Toth. We even have the right to see Russian people having fun in the streets of Moscow. Ernest Borgnine is perfect in the role of Boris Metrov. Recommended to curious ones.
2,Two stars for Four months of operation...,"This switch worked for only a few months. When the summer came around I noticed my temperature would get pretty hot, then the fan would finally kick in. Then over the next week or so, every time I would stop at a light or in traffic the coolant temp would get very high, almost to overheat! Scared the hell out of me. It took a little bit of troubleshooting, but this piece of junk switch stopped working. It would provide hardly enough continuity, so my fan switch relay would cycle rapidly, but never engage until my car was ready to overheat!I used this on my 1999 Honda Civic EX D16Y8 motor. I ended up going to the part store and bought a switch that has a lifetime warranty. Save the hassle, and buy a decent radiator coolant temperature switch with a warranty."
5,Great Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer,"Dynamite, accurate indoor/outdoor thermometer. I tried another brand (Acurite), but the outdoor sending unit (which provides temperature data for the outside temperature) didn't transmit even 30 feet away, much less the specified 100 ft. The Honeywell is stable and the sending unit powerful. Also accurate - placing the base and outside units next to each other showed same temperature - other brand was off by 1 to 2 degrees!"
2,Seriously Out of date; sketchy; mediocre; overpriced,"IN an era where computers change daily in major ways, especially software and operating systems, you would think that the basics at least remain constant. While mostly ture, this tome manages to introduce such topics as hardware concepts and operating system basics couched in the terms of a bygone computing era. Probable best use for this book? Propping up an antique table.(MSdos and the basic programming language, while not really taught with any thoroughness here, are espoused as major players in the computing field....)Assuming you have more than 640K of memory in either your brain or your computer, the best course of action for Operating Systems: A Sytematic View is >>null"
5,"Bad name, great band","This cd is just spectacular & every single track is consistant with this very distinctive style. In other words, nothing seems out of place & you never have to skip a track. Both male & female vocals that are equally beautiful. Very similar to Mew with a more melodic & slower paced sound that can be compared to an English version of Stereolab. The music thats coming out of Iceland is truly something to behold. A dear friend introduced me to Sigur Ros some time ago & I just can't stop listening to this stuff as its way ahead of what most American bands are doing, but I suspect that will soon change. This is a ""must own"" trust me, buy it, you can't go wrong."
4,Great!,Sizing was a little larger than expected. A large looks like an extra large (width) but the length was perfect. Shipping was quick and the jersey was in perfect condition!
4,Expensive but worth it,"I got this for my sister, and she loves it. The only complaint I have is that for the price, it didn't even come with a case! I thought that was strange, but the knife itself looks awesome, and according to my sister, it works amazingly well."
5,The best money can buy!,"Shun Elites are wonderful work of art. I have been using this knife for a couple of months now and it continues to impress me with its amazing quality and sharpness. The steel used to manufacture this knife is the best I have ever seen, it takes a sharp edge easily and holds it extremely well (I sharpen my knives). I own both Globals and Wusthofs and this knife without doubt surpasses them in every aspect. Its build quality is truly exeptional, a highly recommended purchase!"
1,29.99 for 181 days,"29.99 for internet sucks, amazon makes you buy this, and you cant cancel it or you'll get charged over 300 dollars"
1,"I am rating the Amazon's Plan, not t-Mobile's plan","I wasted almost an hour to find out that I have to take this data plan if I want MDA. It doesn't make sense. I feel cheated. THumb down for Amazon, you do not need to be that CHEAP."
1,Ripped Off,"For some reason I think that if you are going to sell someone something for an incredible price, then you should tell them the whole reason why they are getting this product at that incredible price. Amazon should state that this product cost what it cost only if you get the $29.99 data plan and not sneak it into your cost. Good thing T-Mobie gives you 14 days to return the service. This is making T-Mobile look bad."
2,DOESN'T COVER EXCHANGE 2000 OR SQL 2000,This book gives a good explanation of Windows 2000 Clustering in general. Unfortunately I bought the book not only to learn general info but for info on clustering Exchange 2000 and SQL 2000. The author is still writing about Clustering Exchange 5.5 and SQL 7.0 I was very disappointed. Therefore if your intentions are to cluster these two products I would look for another book or Microsoft Technet.
4,Great book for fundamentals.,"I'm new to clustering and needed to understand creating generic service resources and generic application resources in detail. I found exactly that information, in detail, in this book. If you're looking for information on SQL Server 2000 cluster installations this isn't the place, but if you want to understand clustering so that you can work with applications and services that are not cluster aware this is the best book I've seen."
5,Meditation and the Mind and the Monkey,"This is the second book that Ajahn Sumano Bhikkhu wrote next from his "" Questions from the City,Answers from the forest"". You may consider it as the continuation of his first book. In his first book, he answered questions raised by the people that confused and lost in the chaos world. In his second book, he explains further the truth of life from the Buddha's view point, to make the confused people understand why life is the way it is. He wants us to understand the world as it really is, so that we can use the energy that comes from the unified heart and mind to influence the course of things in this world in a meaningful way. He explains how we can live in an appropriate maner, with a sense of reverence and respect for everthing. With wisdom and compassion we can respond appropriately to life. We can do this only when our minds are on our hearts."
1,don't waste your money,"don't waste your money, everything in this book is available on the CompTIA website"
1,Avoid like the plague,I have to agree with everyone else here. What a waste of time and money! I bought the book hoping it was going to provide training for the Network+ Exam and ended up seeing a description for why I should get certified. I KNEW THAT ALREADY!!! THAT IS WHY I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD TRAIN ME FOR THE TEST!!!You should buy a different book or get the great computer-based training course from ForeFront. I studied that and passed first time. It is a great course.
2,Needs a lot of work: not for students.,"I, too grabbed this book on impulse before I checked out the reviews. Bad move, and there went $20. If you are exploring the possibility of getting this certification or of getting into the networking field, this book might be useful. But if you are looking for in-depth info and study questions and things like that, wait for the future flood of N+ books that will surely follow. I found the frequent typos and lack of good editing in this book particularly irritating- with that quality of QA, I would not trust the questions."
1,I would give this zero stars if it were an option,"What book? All I got was the (wordy) introduction to a book. There is no content here. It is all one big overview, with nothing you can't get on the Network+ website for free. The first portion of the book explains the importance of certification, etc. All things we ALREADY know, or we wouldn't have bought the book to begin with. There is a section that points to OTHER books that can supply you with the information, but the problem is that I was looking for the information in this one! Waste of my time and money, and for that I give it ZERO stars. It seems that with the amount of errors in the only content section (the practice quiz) and the unbelievable amount of padding, the authors are deliberately trying to take us for a ride. The minimum rating is one star, but I feel that this book deserves less than that."
2,Maybe if you're new to networking...,"According to the book itself, the test is geared to networking professionals 18-24 months in the field. Most of the book is a description of why you want to be in the IT field you're already in, or how and why to study for a certification test. Of interest are chap. 5-7 with thin descriptions of the Network+ testing categories but good exposure to the concepts you'll have to learn somewhere else. The assessment test in the back is harder than the actual Network+ test (with errors in it.)"
4,A fine start...,"Scars & Stripes contains issues 1 through 4 (the first story arc) from the Vertigo title, American Century. The first issue alone is worth the price of the book, as it sets up Harry's wandering ways. Imagine a character similiar to Indiana Jones that leans more towards an anti-hero. That is Harry. Love the artwork from Marc Lamning! 'Pulp' definitely is the best way to describe this series. The future for this title is bright. Definitely for adults."
4,Looks great - nice balance,"The fighting system in this game is a nice balance of ""arcade style"" (click a lot) and more of an RPG style like Neverwinter Nights (the character does a lot of the basic fighting on its own). I think they did much better than Oblivion, for example, which I find frustrating to control. The graphics are some of the best I have seen and the faces look really good. In fact, the women are quite attractive and the shaping and movement is good enough that they read as very athletic young women. The way hair and clothes move is very good as well. Although the core story is pretty standard stuff, I thought there were some nice innovations and details. If you like martial arts movies, you are quite likely to enjoy this game."
5,this may be one of the graetest games of all time,jade empire special edition offers a wide range game experience.furthermore it get the player to see the point of view of all the characters from yourself a lone orphan destined to save or destroy the empire.
3,Not too shabby!,"Not a bad game at all. Decent storyline, gameplay, and high production values. This studio's put out better material, but if you're in the mood for a fun lil' eastern oriented RPG/Action game, it's worth $15."
4,Great for family discussions,"Our family (2 adults and 2 kids under 8 years old) enjoyed the discussions prompted by this book. The content is geared to children at the lower end of the recommended 7- to 12-year-old range, but covers universal qualities such as honesty, courage, compassion. The illustrations add significantly to the humor of many of the situations presented. I would recommend the book highly to parents who wish to spend time with their children exploring the issues; the book would be of limited value to a child reading alone. Please write another one, Ms. Sheindlin and Mr. Tore!"
4,Book was ripped :(,"Love this book and story but so sad the book had a ripped page when we got it. It's hard to tape a board book. Overall, pleased with this pre-enjoyed product. CD was in great shape!"
3,Just okay,"I bought it to help introduce arabic to my child. It is good because it is in arabic and english. The english translation is correct but it is written in British english and may not be easily understood by american children. The story was not very interesting and the illustrations are just ""okay"". It is not a bad book but it is not on my childs top ten list."
2,Poor Sound Quality,The musical performance is fine but the recording is of poor quality particularly in softer passages. I'm not sure what bit rate was utilized when converting this file to MP3
2,"good service, cd very poor quality",The seller was prompt... but the quality of the recording was very poor... sounds like an old tape that had been dubbed several times.
3,silly shopper,"I ran across this book at a bookstore, & got it for my child's school library (endorsed by librarian). My 6 1/2 yr old 1st grade daughter liked it. The illustrations are zany. The silly story, rhyming, & short length are perfect for this age group - silly sense of humor, new readers, constantly on the move."
3,Small but effective,"I am going to be travelling to Cuba soon and a friend of mine gave the book to me. I read it quite easily actually since the small format helped me carry it in my coat pocket and the easy flowing language made it a pleasant experience. The book does contain all the necessary information one needs before getting to Cuba and while there as my friend told me. What it does lack is some elaboration on the art and history of the island, subjects covered not very deeply by the book. As an introduction it is an excellent travel guide but I felt that I had to get another guide if I wanted to really get all the info that I feel I need to digest before getting to Cuba and making the best of my trip.However, as I said earlier. Read this book if you are not sure about getting there, and read on if you do decide to get there...."
5,Good Buy,"Very accurate and without it I was lost. Great as the engineers must have been on dope when they came up with some of these ideas, like no dipstick , you dont add oil,you only can change it."
5,Great reading,"As a Lebanese I have always been told to be proud of my Phoenician heritage and while I had a decent understanding of the Phoenician culture, it was very nice to dive in more depth. I enjoyed reading this book and the style by which it was written brought me into the heart of the story and allowed me to relate to it. I would recommended, a great read especially if you want to know more about the Phoenician culture."
3,Generation 18,"Relegated to the Spook Squad, Sam Ryan finds herself chasing kites; and this is not an innocuous task- kites are vampiric monsters with no apparent motive but a great appetite for murder. Investigating this with her recalcitrant partner draws Sam into an exploration of genetic engineering and closer to learning about her own mysterious past.*** On the plus side, a fast pace is set and maintained throughout the intriguing plot. However, though characterization is still good, action took priority over it in this volume of the series. Yet, it is still a good read. ***"
4,Generation 18: Spook Squad 2 - Keri Arthur,"This time Sam is tracking a killer who is focusing on people connected to a military project, a project that seems to have knowledge of her background. People with answers to questions of her past are showing up and either dying or refusing to talk. Added to that is the appearance of an `imaginary friend' she only sees when asleep and the emergence of her psychic talents. Plus the attempts on her life are on-going while the tall, dark, and handsome guy is ignoring her.This was another fun read with more action, adventure and the government conspiracy getting bigger and scarier as more of it is exposed. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series so I can find out what happens next!"
4,Another Great Spook Squad Book,"This is the second in the Spook Squad series. Don't read it if you haven't read Memory Zero; it won't make sense without the first book. Here, Arthur has Sam and Gabriel trying to catch a killer while continuing to delve into the mystery that is Sam's past. Arthur does a great job of writing this sort of futuristic paranormal novel. The plot flows well, the world is well-conceived and imaginative, and the character development continues nicely. This is a worthy follow-up to Memory Zero. However, as with the other books in this series, I'm left wondering why it is so short. Most books in this genre are significantly longer, and I'm convinced Arthur is a good enough author to be able to expand her stories just a tad and still maintain their quality."
5,Great Middle Eastern Vegetarian Cookbook,"This book includes many recipes for classic Middle Eastern vegetarian dishes, mainly from the Arab world. Everything looks and sounds delicious and authentic. The recipes are clearly written and don't require many exotic ingredients. I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm always interested in finding tasty non-meat dishes to vary the daily menu and this cookbook delivers on that! The recipes in this book are ovo-lacto, but many of them can easily be adapted to vegan cooking. I definitely recommend this book! With recipes like these, meat really becomes irrelevant -- these dishes are all intrinsically good themselves!"
4,A Rich and Treasured Book,"This is a wonderful book not only for the recipes but for the insights in to the part food plays in the everyday lives and culture of the people of the Middle East and North Africa. Salloum gives a brief history of most of the dishes and places them in geographical and cultural context. I enjoyed reading it as much for the delicious food as the explainations. My only criticism would be that there are no pictures in the book so a novice cook like myself has little idea of how to serve the recipes. A minor quibble... it is a lovely book and has delicious, tasty recipes."
5,"simple, delicious, wonderful",Bought this book on a whim for my vegetarian husband for a birthday gift. Turns out that every dish is absolutley delicious. We have tried many recipies in the book and have been very happy with the simplicity and results. We highly recommend the purchase of this book if you are interested in middle eastern and/or vegetarian cooking.
5,Another great Titanic book from Walter Lord,"Walter Lord doesn't profess to be a Titanic expert, but he is. This book shows the complexity of the inquiry into the sinking, and it raises some questions I've never heard before."
3,After 100 Years,"Most of this book is a re-hash of previously published info which is why I gave it a 3. I've long been interested in the Titanic; my uncle used to read ""A Nigh to Remember"" to me when I was a child. The biggest new info is about the initial damage done when the ship first hit the iceberg. Not one very long narrow gash, but two separate gashes; which is why the ship sank. It had nothing to do with bulkheads being one deck lower. The author also explained why the water-tight doors did not extend all the way up. New info is also provided on the later court hearings. If this is your introduction to the Titanic sinking, I would give the book a 6 rating for you."
5,"Very good, and concise.",Coming from someone who knows very little about the Titanic I thought it was great. It taught me all about the details that led up to the sinking and the suicide that is a major interest of mine.
4,Most interesting book about the Titanic,"I read this book during my summer vacation and I thought it was really interesting. This book was so great, as soon as I bought it i couldn't stop reading it. All the facts are true and at some parts it made me kind of sad to see that so many people had died and there was plenty of room on the life boats. I guess some people were very stubborn in those times. The fact is if you enjoy the Titanic then this is the type of book you would enjoy because it gives you the perspective of some of the survivors."
4,Very Insightful Book!,"Walter Lord's ""The Night Lives on"" offers insightful accounts of this nearly unbelievable human tragedy. As an enthusist, who tries to devour all information about the Titanic, I found this book to be edifying. Lord gives perspective into various facts and possibilities of how as ship a large and grand as the Titanic could possibly have been taken down in two hours from hitting an iceberg. The elucidation of events, neglectfulness, incompetence and corporate greed that all contributed to this unthinkable tragedy are still bone-chilling and upsetting, even today, almost 100 years later.I recommend this writing to all those persons who seek a deeper understanding of this historical tragedy, which began long before the ship first sailed by corporate decision makers and others."
5,Meat Tenderizer,Great meat tenderizer- goes easily through the meat and is easy to clean (just place in dishwasher).
5,No More Bull From the Butcher!,"The Jaccard works great! If you want to make chicken fried steak this is the way to go. I used to either buy round steak and pound it with a textured mallet which turned the meat into mush. Or I'd buy cube steak at the meat counter. Problem was, you never know what kind of meat they use. They can even take scraps, overlap the edges, run it through their cubing machine and voilà, they've sold you scraps for the price of steak! With the Jaccard I select the pieces of meat I want, trim them the way I want, and then process to a degree that equals or surpassed the results from a butcher's cubing machine."
4,Jaccard and Marinade are GREAT Together,"Works well on steak. Allows you to use the less fatty cuts and still get great taste and texture. Makes unbelievable chicken breast. Puncture the meat liberally with the Jaccard then soak the meat in marinade. Low fat salad dressing works great as does bottled marinade. Grill or broil and enjoy tender and great tasting steaks, chops and poultry. Even works on fried meat but not as well."
3,It was OK,I used this tenderizer at least 3x/month for about 3 years before it needed replaced. I recently replaced it with the Deni MT149 and am 100% satisfied with that product. This Jaccard was just OK for me. I liked that it could be disassembled and could be washed in the dishwasher. I did not like how much force was required to pierce the meat and the blades often got stuck and would not retract without a little help. I ultimately replaced it because the tips of the knives became dull making it even more difficult to pierce the meat. It was OK while it lasted but I would recommend the Deni MT149 over this based on my experience with both.
1,Beware of Faulty Manufacturing and metal pieces in your meat,"At first glance, this looks like a really great product. I purchased one and used it one time, and it really made the beef roast very tender. Then I went to wash it and discovered that the stainless steel on the prongs are just pot metal with a stainless steel coating. Some of the stainless steel coating had come off and bits of it were in my beef roast. I had to throw the roast away, for fear of eating pieces of metal that would most likely cut me up inside. I hoped and prayed that the beef I had eaten, did not contain some of the metal bits. Please beware of this product. Why couldn't they just used solid stainless steel prongs, which would not exhibit this problem. Again, beware because the stainless steel metal can peal off and bits of metal can be lodged in your food. VERY DANGEROUS."
2,NOt so easy to clean,"bought one.it works well, but it is very hard to clean. sometimes, little chiken pieces get stuck near the top.remeber, theses 45 spikes are knives.. it's very hard to clean between them.mine ended up in the trash can because my wife worried about the contamination ."
1,NOT Made in the U.S.A.!!!,"Product clearly states ""Made in China"" on the packaging. This is false advertising! I know most people don't care, but I do care about the future of our country, so I want to buy something that is actually made in the USA when it says it is made in the USA."
4,good stuff,"This first is to Celtic Wizard ""haritasha"". Um. do little research before displaying your ignorance - there are 2 books, the Greater Key and the Lesser Key both translated by a singular man named Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers (Liddell soemtimes with one l). The lesser Key was seemingly inspired by the Greater, both books being from at least as early as the 17th century (the Greater more like from the 15th) and obviously rewritten from material perhaps centuries older.On to the review. Sorry to say I have only read excerpts so far but it seems to be a very thorough take me by the hand approach to summoning spirits except that the style and terms are, obviously, archaic and somewhat obtuse. Nevertheless, and excellent additon to the library of the serious Wiccan, Templar, or Mage."
2,The Greater Key of Solomon..,"I ordered expecting way too much, a good buy no? Actually no it wasn't, because:Pros:-- It does have good info-- It's wording is preciseCons:-- Margins are too wide, they could've used the extra space to make the text bigger..-- it doesn't get too in depth about some aspects-- the page ordering for some reason isn't consistent (Some things were mixed around for lord knows why...)-- it looks and feels as if all and I mean *all* of it was photocopied into the book. and because of that the print was almost illegible because of the nicks and black spots due to said photocopying...So it wasn't the best thing in the world... But unfortunately due to this, I don't think that this should be in anybody's list of things to buy... It's best to find this elsewhere..."
2,Just ok,Just ok. At times very boring. I was expecting more and much better info. If I decide to engage in summonings then may there will be some use for this.
3,You get what you pay for,"I definitely was expecting more. I thought I was buying the entire book and not just a photo copied cut down version of the book. Then again, for 10 bucks it was probably too good to be true. It did have some interesting information and some of the symbols were a little difficult to decipher as the pages looked as though they took the original book and copied them on a copy machine or a scanner. Bottom line, don't expect too much from this copy. They did ship in a timely manner though."
1,KAKA,"The key of Solomon was originally from Latin texts. There are two Hebrew texts that are from the 15 to 17th centuries. In other words, since Solomon would not have known Latin he did not scribe it. Therefore its old Gentile kaka. If one wishes to know Kabbalah I suggest ""God is a Verb"" by Rabbi Cooper."
4,why,It is a photo copy version of the original keys of solomon the king book how ever the seals are a bit larger so could be copied better. But be carful not to order the tow books at the seme time like I did as you would have have actually purchase the same booke twice.
1,not so special,"im not very impressed with the book, you could purchase the key of solomon cheaper. The contents are the same except for this one is styled of the 1914 edition. very dissapointed."
2,"Same pulp as always,regardless of edition.","The supposed 'Greater Key' does not surpass the lesser in any extraordinary sense,and the overwhelming consensus among practioners of the occult science is that the 'Greater' of the two may indeed be a hoax.Speaking with my personal knowledge of the subject,I would put the weight of merit with Lemegeton.That said,however,the Greater Key is perfect for that empty spot on a dusty bookshelf.Not to be taken so damnably serious,though."
2,Disappointing Read,"The sentiment behind the book is from a good place, but the presentation is out-dated, extremely far from concise and needlessly long-winded. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING! Don't buy."
4,My heart's in the Highlands -- or is it?,"I couldn't put this charming book down. Having a near life-long desire to live in Scotland or Ireland (I know -- they're not the same!), I couldn't resist ordering this book. Ms. Rathbone is a fine writer and evokes her Scottish home in both its glory and its -- well, not tatters, but let's say less happy aspects. I still want to go to Scotland -- but she made me see things a little more realistically than I had before.The book ends too abruptly -- tho' I respect the author's reasons for doing so. But it's still a ""grrrand"" book and I look forward to reading more by Belinda Rathbone."
4,good read,"I like all things Scottish. The book can be read, put down, then read some more but stays interesting."
2,not what i expected,"i dont think it was worth the money i paid for it.i thought it would have had a leather cover on it,although it didnt state this.other than that,it was fine"
5,The Scriptures That Work !,"This is the best study tool I have ever come across, and with it's greek-english keyword concordance it clears many words from the faulty english language up. ""Remember Jesus never spoke anglo-saxion english"". I recommend this version for the glory of God.Grace and Peace !!"
4,Break out the popcorn for another enjoyable spy thriller,"The Mackintosh Man is a reminder that the spy thriller genre gained traction in the '60s and '70s because of some very intriguing movies. This movie brings together a strong script and a stellar cast that includes Paul Newman, James Mason, Dominique Sanda, Ian Bannen and Harry Andrews.Newman plays an Australian recruited by British Intelligence to find a mole. When you hear him speak, you'll be reminded more of Mel Gibson's accent than the accent of another famous Aussie, Paul Hogan.Paul Newman's incredible body of work includes classics such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Hud, Cool Hand Luke, The Hustler, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and The Color Of Money. He was nominated nine times for an Oscar. This wasn't one of those films but he delivers a memorable performance.Directed by John Huston, written by Walter Hill, great performance by Paul Newman, James Mason and Dominique Sanda. What more could you want for a thriller?"
2,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 30","One may wonder why John Huston trusted Dominique Sanda with Mrs. Smith's role. Was it in order to give an even colder atmosphere to this film about Cold War ? Did he think that the final scene would be more memorable if it was played by the constip... err! by the uptight French actress ? I don't know. Still, I liked a lot the Irish part of The Mackintosh Man with an interesting car chase and beautiful landscapes. But, as it's the 3rd or the 4th time that I see this film and as I nonetheless always forget its plot, let's keep it reserved to John Huston completists. Only."
3,Holds up...barely,This non-event in the career of two screen greats is notable chiefly for some of the lamest fight sequences ever shot. Newman bops the bad guys on the head and they collapse unconscious. Otherwise it's slight but enjoyable.
3,Hard to put down,"I'd have to say that I really enjoyed reading Rainbow Song. I actually started reading it because I wanted to know what my girlfriend was getting so excited about, every time she read it. Being a straight man, I was really hesitant about reading a book that dealt with gay men and gay sex, but once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.When I read the first couple of chapters, I couldn't believe what I was reading. The beginning of the book reminded me of some of the porn stories I've read in adult magazines, only with a twist. Now I know why my girlfriend was so entertained.I really fell in love with the character ""Madison"", who reminded me so much of my girlfriend, who also has a few gay-male friends of her own. Madison is both feisty and funny at the same time and keeps the main character ""Chuck"" in check, despite their differences.Nice work with this one!"
3,Touching Story,"The book was bought based on the glowing reviews. I was very disappointed.I found the story overly long. The story seemed to go on in forever before anything interesting happened. The overall storyline was good. Lonely gay, lost loves, missed love and the people who passed through his life. It was very touching and sad toward the end. The ending was shocking, and very,very sad, but was worth skimming over some of the too long conversations to get to it. It was a wonderful story about love. Love that comes in many forms and how love was found through the death of someone else."
4,"Funny, Satisfying and Realistic","I bought this book on the advice of friends, and it was incredible. I wasn't sure what to expect from this book about the love between two guys who fell in love at first sight, but I was pleasantly surprised and moved by the clandestine love between them throughout the story.It is a very accurate look at the gay lifestyle, from gay bars to bath houses. I could recognize so many of my friends in the characters of this book, and I really got caught up in seeing how their lives would turn out. The ending was something that took me by surprise. You have got to read this book! It's beautifully written, powerful and emotional. A book I think that everyone should own.Mario Watts, all of my respect to you! I HIGHLY recommend this book!"
1,Does not work!,"I have a Silverado 1500LT with a radio\CD\tape player. It also has a CD changer port. I call PAC prior to purchase and they stated this would work with my radio, all I had to do was have the dealership activate the CD changer port. After taking the vehcile to two different dealerships it was determined this could not be done. I installed the AAI GM-12 before going to the dealership and now I have $50 AAI GM-12, and a $35 dealership fee that are doing me no good. Plus a switch in my dashboard. This may work if it came with the factory installed CD changer but it certainly does not work if your vehicle does not.Just to be clear, I called PAC prior to purchasing this product. I guess they will say anything to make a sale.Bad product and bad company."
4,A well organized review of Emergency Medicine.,"I am an Emergency Medicine resident, using this book as required reading in my program. This text is well written and organized. The first few chapters review the basics of resuscitation and procedues. This is followed by a systematic review of Emergency Medicine, first the medical, then surgical, then misc (tox, environmental, OB-GYN). The chapter are set up into prehospital care for doctors doing online medical control, then the ABC's, then background, presentation, clinical features, treatment, and concludes with special considerations and pertinent pediatric apects. It is readable and gives a good review of Emergency Medicine."
1,A badly botched model,"My oven died on the 4th use just like the other reviewer's. I would stongly advise against getting this model (my previous Panasonic microwave was OK, so hopefully this problem is model-specific).For the 3 times it worked, I didn't have any complaints...Update on 4/7: It took the repair shop 4 weeks to get the needed parts (fried inverter and tube). So I would caution people to be vary of the support Panasonic provides. But now that it's fixed, it works great (and I love the sensor feature, it heats my stuff to the perfect temperature without any user interaction)."
1,Like Panasonic Microwaves--not this one.,"The microwave worked for about three days. Then the microwave smelled like it was burning, and then didn't heat up anything. I have had Panasonic Microwaves for quite a while and they have had long lives and worked well. This one was defective.Also, it had a few odd things. There is no oven light when you open the door. The clock/time display is faint and is not easy to read. I would buy another panasonic microwave but not this model."
4,"Enjoyable book: a quick read, tightly paced ""noir-lite""","Without revealing the plot (!)---The main character is a gritty used-car salesman par excellence, and the storyline deals with him becoming aware of his life's limitations, and his subsequent response to this wake-up call for greater meaning. Ironically, the book is not about a woman chaser, per se...Willeford uses his main character's view to point out a number of human failings, and the brisk plotline and well-developed supporting cast are more than willing to reveal some of life's bitter ironies. The result is an enjoyable and quick read, filled with tinges of sarcasm and understated dark humor."
1,Secret Lovers,"This is not one of Charles McCarry's better books. McCarry is a retired CIA spook who knows the tradecraft of which he writes but he is lazy in his continuity of his characters. For example, the hero's 'outfit' handler in this book is married. In others I have read he has been single. The 'outfit' station chief in Berlin is referred to as a buffoon and is never introduced as a character while in other novels he is mentor and best friend of the hero. Finally, McCarry needs to learn something about sailing. He has his hero sailing in the North Sea in some novels and at one point had the boat sailing ""close hauled before the wind."" I don't know whether this is sloppy writing or bad editing."
2,Intresting story laced with horrible subplot,"I read the Miernik Dossier which I really like so I was willing to give this book a shot despite reading the mixed reviews. Well they were spot on, first of all, McCarry should not write about sex, it seem gratuitous and mostly strikes a false note, it doesn't seem real. Paul Christopher is slowly morphing into a James Bond like super spy. It seems McCarry has a weakness with female roles, they all seem to him as merely vessels for sexual fantasies. gave up on this book after six chapters. By the way Le Carre has the same problem with female characters."
3,British Dettol is not the same as Indian Dettol,"This Indian-made Dettol is a strange reddish-orange color, not the yellow color of the Made-in-Britain Dettol. The scent is fairly close, but it feels a bit different on the skin. The bars are TINY, also. For us Americans who don't know what 75 grams is -- it ends up being a bar of soap slightly larger than what you'd get in a hotel room."
2,Look elsewhere for the story of SMiLE,"Having enjoyed DP's ""Dumb Angel Gazette"" story of SMiLE and seeing that Brian Wilson and VD Parks wrote forwards to it, I thought that this might be THE book on this topic. I was so wrong.The author flies off on innumerable tangents, spends too much time with tangential tie-ins about 2nd, 3rd and 4th tier LA groups, etc and spends too little time on the story of SMiLE. I agree Whole-heartedly with the critiques of the other reviewers here. Also, you'd hardly know from this book that Mr. Wilson experienced some significant, disastrous mental health problems beginning in this period. Wilson discusses it openly; why doesn't Priore?If you want to know the story of SMiLE, get the ""Beautiful Dreamer"" DVD or read ""The Beach Boys and the California Myth"" by David Leaf or ""The Nearest Faraway Place"" by Timothy White."
1,"Brian knew this book would come out one day, and his song titles tell the tale","""Wouldn't it be Nice"" if this book had something interesting to say. ""You Still Believe in Me"", but I don't believe in this book. ""Don't Talk"" about this book ever again. ""I'm Waiting for the Day"" when this book goes out of print. ""Let's go Away for a While"" and only come back when this book is gone. ""Sloop John B."" should have sank with the manuscript for this book. ""God Only Knows"" why anyone would buy this book. ""I Know There is an Answer"" for why anyone would like this book, I just don't know what it is. ""Here Today"", in the garbage tomorrow. ""I Just Wasn't Made for These Times"", unfortunately this book was. ""Pet Sounds"" for me are the ripping or burning of this book. ""Caroline No"", don't buy this book.Thanks Brian for trying to warn us all those years ago not to buy this book that you somehow knew would come out 40 years in the future."
1,You're probably wasting your time with this book,"This book is impossible to read. It JUMPS AND JUMPS AND JUMPS aroud so much. I'm not exaggerating by saying that most of the book has nothing to do with SMiLE itself. Most of the book is about Beach Boys history and Brian. Not about the actual album. I know everything there is about Brian, I wanted to find out about the album and the creation. Barely anything written about it. My main critique is that it jumps around chronologically and off-topic. Hard to read. Not very interesting either. Nothing a Brian Wilson fan wouldn't know"
4,A good afternoon read,"I was drawn to this book because of its setting -- a mental health clinic. I was both hopeful and afraid that I would see some clients of the clinics used as characters in the book (these can go either way -- respectful and funny, or disrespectful and mean). What I found was a good, quick afternoon's read. Liz James is a character I like and will want to visit again. The setting of Lethal Lessons is secondary to the story -- the staff of the clinic could be any English Department at any university <smile>. Plotting was good; dialog was enjoyable, there was plenty of action but not too much gore. This is one of those ""medium boiled books"" that are a smidge past cozy, and not hard-boiled either. My favorite!"
4,A pleasure to listen to.,"If you like flute music, you will like this album. It's a very good, pleasant job done with some pretty difficult to play material. This is the sort of album you will be able to listen to several times in one sitting, without even realizing it. Good Stuff, I hope that they come out with some more. Incidentally, I found this album by accident one day while while searching the internet for our somewhat unusual family name. Ended up buying it out of curiosity. (Don't worry, I'm not related to anyone on the album.)"
1,Do Not Buy! Its Made From A Plastic Bag,"I was so disappointed when I received my costume. There are changes that is made from the picture. The fabric is different, its much cheaper, it is made from plastic! The top looked like a plastic bad. The pants look really cheap, and you can tell that the mask was made in a hurry. The gloves has these fingernails on it that is made from rubber, and is shown on my thread that is hanging off each nail which makes it look really really cheap. I am so mad that they would send me this crap! I am returning it. Do not buy this one from costume kingdom, they will send you something that cost them $2 to make."
2,Ho-hum.,"This book had been buried in my to-be-read pile. Sometimes, when I dig out a book that's been in there for a long time, I kick myself for not reading it sooner. That's not the case with this one.Crossword puzzle writer Belle and P.I. Rosco are on the trail of whoever killed two homeless people and a missing puppy. Then Rosco disappears, and Belle starts receiving cryptic crossword puzzles that she has to solve to find him.The good:The puzzles are clever and fun to solve.The premise is cute.The bad:Stilted dialogue--heck, all the writing is stilted.The characters act weirdly--without motivation to do so.Gratuitous use of italics.The cryptic crossword puzzles were just tedious.While I understand that people will kill over just about anything, the motive was hard to believe.And a bunch of nits too minor to mention.The verdict:My impression is that this was about the 6 crossword puzzles contained in the book. The story, such as it was, was just filler."
5,The Crossword Connection,Fast delivery. Book was in great condition. I am very happy with this purchase and would buy from this seller again.
4,Linux Kernel,This book is very comprehensive. It includes information about the kernel auto loading and recent upgrades in the 2.X kernel series. A good start if you want to understand how the linux kernel works and want to develop drivers for the kernel.
5,rayjoy@ipa.net,"As I said in my review of Take Back The Night. I wish I had, had this one to read first. Again I say Dennis make the words in his books sing. I really enjoyed this book. Having been a member A LRRP/RANGER unit 68 - 69 I feel that this is an authentic story of how things were in these units. Cpt Hollister I feel was an insperation to his men. I thought That Dennis had an outstanding way of telling this story. No BS just as it happened. Roadrunner6 Out"
4,fast-paced action story with good storyline as well.,good story mixed with great action make this a must for those who like real-life-like guts and glory reads. The pace is good and the realism is sooo life-like. It is character-driven and strong-willed men who gave it their all so Americans can roam free!
2,carribean pictures,"I bought this for rainy days on the treadmill. It looks like someone just put up a camera and filmed the same thing.The camera never moves. It,s boaring. The music is more inline with elevator music. If your going to make a dvd on the caribbean at least use island music. Save your money and if you have to have it buy it used."
1,This thing sucks!!!,I thought i would finally be able to play my old gameboy and gameboy color games on tv but all i got was a colored pixelated screen very much distored. I did get sound though but thats all I got. The installation was difficult to do so it should have been made easier although i did figure it out but after all that i just got a mess on my screen. They really should have made the installations easier. Its almost as if you have to get a professional to get it finished. Its ridiculous and after all that it didnt even work. This product sucks and does not work. Again this product does not work so buyers beware.
1,Complicated,"This product was so difficult to put together, and I still have yet to get it to fully work on the tv. So far all I can get to work is the sound, but there is absolutely no pictures. The manual is difficult to understand and not very through. It is advertise as an easy object to put together and will take approximately 5 minutes to complete, and that a teenager can easily assemble it. My daughter is 19 years old, and even she can't understand how to get it to work along with her friend. It was a big waste of money, and now my younger son can't even play with the gameboy advance on tv, but it still works on handset."
3,skin,"parts of the movie, i really did the like and, the movie itself was made to quick. could have been made better."
3,Good characterization -- so-so story,"While I did finish the book, I was never emotionally committed to either the characters or the story line. Basically, the theme of the book is if you have enough money, you can get anything done. The pact between the friends was a bit unrealistic but because the characters were all quite well off financially, they could leave their lives, jobs, families, etc. for weeks at a time without any problems.I picked up this hard back book for $4.98 at a clearance rack and it's about all that it was worth. Not on my list of recommendations to my friends."
5,You'll not soon forget . . .,"In 1976, a helicopter crash in England renders three teen-agersorphans just two weeks after their graduation from the American Schoolin London. Originally from the US, the three--Olivia Segal, the daughter of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust; Annie Aldrich, Protestant from San Francisco, and Jamie Arias, Catholic scion of a great shipping family from Rhode Island--became friends while their parents worked in England.Banding together, they create a pact--whenever one of them is in need of comfort, friends, whatever, it makes no difference--the other two will drop everything to go to the aid of the one who asks. ...THE PACT is a riveting, can't-put-it-down novel that will remain in your mind and your heart for a long time after you've read the final page. This is Hilary Norman's eighth book. If you've not read any of the others, you'll want to, after you've read THE PACT."
2,Little info!,I recently purchased this book to review for an entrance exam. This info is not at an RN level. The majority of these question are just commen sense. They could be answered correctly by the general public.
4,You get what you pay for,"This book is 9 dollars for a reason. Considering price to quality I give it four stars because while the questions aren't challenging, you can use the questions to practice strategies. I first read Kaplan's book to get the strategies. But all skills take practice and I wanted to save Kaplan's questions for more intensive study. This book allowed me a chance to get used to using the strategies, so when I move on to better study guides it'll be habit."
3,Needs more,"Its a quick review but not something you can study from for rn exams, flash cards are memory joggers, not this, not a waste of money but not the best"
5,Women's Ministry,"In researching for a book on women soul care-giving, it is often difficult, unfortunately, to find examples of Protestant women in the early years of the Reformation, who left writings to examine. Bainton's three book series on women of the reformation has been a gold mind of primary source and historical background. Well worth the purchase price for the serious student of Reformation history from a feminine perspective.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , Soul Physicians, Spiritual Friends, ""Martin Luther's Pastoral Counseling,"" and the forthcoming ""Sacred Friendships: Listening to the Voices of Feminine Soul Care and Spiritual Direction."""
4,Excellent for both students and professionals!,"I am an architecture student and have found this book to be invaluable. Many of my professors have been impressed with this text and have thought of requiring it. Stitt's format of easy to photocopy pages with comprehensive checklists make this book helpful for keeping up with the commom sense portions of materials selection and space design. The author uses room-by-room descriptions of everything from electrical concerns to materials and mechanics. Nearly every common building type is included and I know that when I have met the requirements Stitt outlines, that my imagination is my only boundary in a terrific design. It is a book that I am sure I will use nearly every time I start a project for the rest of my life."
5,first class collection,This is a collection of reprints of famous magazine and journal articles about passive devices used in RF designs that are hard to find. It is arranged in sections with a summary preceding the reprints.The classic papers vary in clearness. The ones from trade magazines are short on theory but very practical for designers. The ones from scientific journals are very compactly written and may be hard to follow by some engineers.
3,Magic Number - That Day,"Mellow broken-beat future jazz from Magic Number on the joint Stereo Deluxe/Mantis Recordings album THAT DAY. And it hits all the right notes: the calm layered vocals and strings of ""Turn Back"" and ""Suddenly"" and the more uptempo groove and warbling chord progressions of ""That Day."" ""My Interruption"" gets slightly more digital with its all percussion format. For those in a brighter mood, ""Sun Song"" takes proto-African acoustic guitar and bass-fueled journey that's reminiscent of Atjazz's ""Touch the Sun."" ""Fly Away"" wouldn't be out of place on Naked Music. But although the production quality is undoubtedly great, the songs themselves seemed to neutral, with neither any standouts nor any bombs. The consistency seems to flatten the album as a whole, so while ""Sad World"" has more of a melancholic tinge to the music, the lyrics don't reflect this. Some more variation would be welcome, though there's no disputing the easygoing mood and vibe here."
3,disappointed,I bought this for my two year old. He has aproxia of speech so we are teaching him sign language. I thought it was simple enough to keep his attention but the signs are not correct. I do not want to teach him the wrong signs because he may never be able to communicate like most of us do. I was disappointed to say the least.
1,Not ASL,At first I was very excited to get this book for my son. As I was going through i realized that the signs were not ASL and although simillar it was confusing to him since we had been working on ASL and watching Signing Time. I won't buy anymore in this series since it is not ASL. If you are using your own signs or following baby signs I think it is cute but if you are following ASL all of the signs are differant.
1,Not like ASL - Never used the book or signs,The book doe not depict American Sign Language. It shows some form or version of a baby sign language. Stick with ASL and get products published by Baby Signing Times. My child learned ASL by watching these videos. Completely amazing. This book was a waste of money.
1,not real Sign Language,"I feel there should be a disclaimer making it clear that these signs are not all the signs being used by the Deaf Community. We have Deaf people in our family so we would prefer to use real American Sign Language Signs to teach babies. In the event the baby encounters a real Deaf person, they would share the same signs."
5,Love This Series!,"My children have had a blast looking at these books! They are great, with real life babies to relate to. Fun reading for anytime!!Mother of 4"
3,Great HD picture....poor flesh tones,I really am enjoying the new Sony TV. I had a 720P Sony TV and all in all I have to say that out of the box the picture was better on the other one. Don't get me wrong...this is a great set but the auto adjustments on the other was much better. In other words you really have to tweak and fine tune each channel to get that perfect picture. Flesh tones is where I really noticed the difference. I have always prided my Sony products in the sense that people ....well looked like people. Out of the box everyones skin tone was the same. After alot of adjustments the picture really started coming in. I don't think I am a fan of there new technology. The old one was better but I didn't care for the screen door effect. I know it sounds like i am bashing the new one....but seriously it is a good tv not great though. Not like my other Sony.
4,Sony kds-50a2000,"First big screen, the SXRD is absolutely the best picture, but....somehow missed they eliminated the picture and picture feature. Sony includes a ""freeze frame"" function which is really useless. The ""picture in a picture"" or ""picture and picture"" which Sony calls it has been removed and priced accordingly from the other models which eliminates the ability to ""multi-task"" ie two channels, DVD & TV, pc monitor, etc. Still a great picture and good looking package, just limited to viewing single source."
2,10 months and TV is dead.,"How to start...This review would have been 5 stars until just 10 months into its life the damn TV stopped working. It seemed to happen overnight. I was watching TV fine one night and the next day I went to turn the TV on and I crapped my pants. The fan came on and the green power LED lit up just like normal, but the screen never came on. Instead the fan shut off and the green LED turned to red and started blinking.The only positive thing I can say is Sony support was very helpful. Not a long wait on the telephone and the person I spoke with seemed sympathetic. She referred me to an official Sony repair store and I have an appointment to get it fixed.Luckily the TV broke before the 1 year parts/labor warranty ended. I expected better quality from Sony...something that would not break down in 10 months. Hopefully Sony will extend the warranty since they had to fix it. I will keep my fingers crossed though."
5,Optimal Settings,What are the optimal settings for non-HD sources and HD siources and are they different for each channel? What cables provide the best picture quality? What are some alternative HD DVD players and will non-HD DVD players provide a good picture?
1,I Have a Defective SONY KDS50A2000,"For those of you that may check back after they find out the have problems with their SONY rear projection TV and feel theirs is a rare case, it's not. I'll keep this short since I am providing two places to get more information. If you notice blue blobs, green/yellow tints or any other problems associates with the optical block, you make have recourse. Go to Facebook and search for ""I Have a Defective Sony TV"". Don't bother contacting the normal Sony CS, contact Sony Listens (email on Facebook's page). There is also an abundance of information relating to this defect in other areas on the web, just google ""I Have a defective sony TV"". A good one is at the [...].Good Luck"
4,Nice TV,"Really nice TV, love the 1080i HD. Delivery service was ok, white glove all the way. The delivery took awhile to get from the warehouse but the actual delivery person was pretty good. Free shipping, what can you say. Took all the trash with them and helped set the tv into place. Made sure there was no damage. Have had no problems with the TV. Great picture!"
4,Great TV - No rainbows!!!,"Before this TV I had purchased a DLP 1080p TV from a local big box retailer, but I quickly discovered the mysterious rainbows that a small percentage of people see.I quickly returned to the store and exchanged the DLP for this TV! Though I did perfer the brightness of the DLP, I have really started to enjoy this TV - especially after finding the correct settings for all the user adjustable menu items.I was very fortunate and after 25 days of having the TV, the retailer clearanced them out and I was able to get a price adjustment to make the TV only cost $1350!!!! Amazon's price is great, but they should be going on clearance soon to make way for the A2020 version of the tv. Get a great deal at clearance and you'll be happy!"
4,"Sony KDS-50A2000 Grand WEGA 50"" SXRD 1080p Rear Projection HDTV","Excellent picture and controls. The remote is well thought out and there is single button access to the most used basic controls such as picture viewing area and sound type. The picture itself is excellent with good blacks and shadow detail. Motion seems to be blur free and no rainbow effect. I think for the price it would be difficult to find a better unit that is 1080P capable. A third HDMI would have been nice.The sound from the built in speakers is just OK, but most people are like myself and have an external speaker setup. I would definitly do this purchase again and the service from Amazon was perfect. I had the TV within 5 days."
1,SONY IS JUNK,"Bought my 50"" in 2004. $3,600 !! Now the screen is covered with little blue pixels and a blue blob !! Bad optical block (known defect in product). Cost to repair? $1,200 !! SONY says ""go scratch"" DO NOT BUY SONY or you are in for a real shafting.Product is junk."
1,Works Great Until the Warranty Expires,"Don't Buy IT! I purchased this tv in November 2006. I loved it. Great color, would have highly recommended it back then. Now it is May 2008. There is now a big yellow blob on my screen. Of course my 1 year warranty has already expired!The yellow blob, from what I have now read is a common problem with the Sony tv's that occurs approx. 1 and 1/2 to 2 and 1/2 years after purchase. Sony had a class action lawsuit filed against them for this same issue. Sony covered the repair costs on 2 of their models based on the class action suit. They are refusing to cover the repairs on this model.Buyer Beware! If you buy this tv make sure you get the extended warranty!"
1,Mine came dead!,"I've bought this battery to complement the one that came with my camcorder. Due to it's high capacity, I was hoping to be able to record a full disc without having to replace the battery. Since the battery arrived, I've tryied to charge it in the camcorder and also with my wall charger, unsucessfully. My multimeter shows it can't keep any energy, plain dead. I might have been unlucky, but there should be a more eficient Quality Control to avoid things like that. Since I live in Brazil, it's too expensive to ask for a replacement. Just had to trash it."
1,Is he paid by the word?,"The author appears to have a knack for making overly complicated that which should be easily grasped , eschewing the readily comprehensible in favor of a profusion of arcane terms of art, circular reasoning, and needlessly drawn-out redundancies. Like Clarence in his Malmsey he lurches to and fro, chapters marked by an airy, over-the-river-and-through-the-woods approach that seldom leaves the reader feeling any more informed than he was before he started. And as a previous reviewer noted, the tome is riddled with typographical and grammatical errors which do little to ease the put-upon reader's sense of frustration. Repeated and highly focused attempts at critical reading succeeded in educing little more than a profound sense of mental lassitude, with nary a smidgen of enlightenment to reward my efforts. As the ashes settle, I find this little more than an errant vanity work foisted upon the captive audience unfortunate enough to have it assigned as a text."
1,HORRIBLY CONFUSING!!,"Well this was the textbook our professor assigned for Remedies but I would have much rather preferred a different book instead (Maybe the E&E; series). Usually I find the ""understanding"" series to be helpful, but NOT in this case. The text is lengthy & confusing. It is not in an ""easy to follow"" format. In other texts you at least get a clear way to outline. Things are usually italicized for easy reference. But NOT HERE!Not helpful at all!!!"
3,THIS BOOK SUCKS,Get the DOBBS Remedies treatise & Common Law Pleading by Koffler ( for a lucid exposition on the old writs ) - there are non better .. I think this is one of the worst outlines I have ever read - useless -
2,banks for kids,my son is two and and not a good gift for the way it is decribed. maybe better for a 5+. i found it boring as did he.
3,Expected more.,"Purchased the doll for my granddaughter. She opened the package, thanked me and set the doll down on the sofa. The child didn't even take it out of the box. This doll was lovely, appeared to be of excellent quality, well-dressed. But it wasn't very exciting. I was very disappointed in her reaction although I felt that the doll was really beautiful. It came well-package and was shipped in a timely manner. I was surprised though when I realized that I had actually paid MORE than the company's suggested retail price for it.."
2,Faded,I loved the design but it was not meant to withstand sun. Faded quite a bit in a year or two. Probably should not be used on a car...maybe on a binder or something.
1,Item was DOA,"Item died on day one. I am not an audiophile, but noticed the sound quality was way below what I was expecting and the range was limited to about 10-15 ft in my house. I am looking for a refund."
2,Not dependable,"It's great when it works, but that's the problem. I can get it to work very easily with my Smartphone, BUT getting it to work with my laptop PC is another question. Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. I ALWAYS have to ""re-pair"" it when I use it with my PC if I hope to have any chance to get it to work."
2,"Nice idea, not well executed.","These would be really cool if: they fit, I could adjust the volume of the microphone, I could turn them off.I could also do without the stupid LEDs flashing all the time, you have to turn that off every time you recharge them.I have a couple other pairs of behind-the-head style headphones and they fit just fine. Jabra apparently makes these for people with either giant or tiny heads, I'm not sure which.The cheap microphone is so over-modulated that I had to tape a piece of foam over the mic to be able to use them with skype. Even turing down the microphone settings to zero in skype doesn't seem to have any effect on the mic levels of this headset.Getting them to turn off and stay off is nearly impossible. You have to find the magical sequence of button taps and holds to turn them off and then anything bumping the huge buttons will turn them on again. You can't even take out the batteries. A tiny on/off switch would be fabulous."
2,"It makes sound, Thats about it...","These Sound Ok (not great but ok) if they are plugged directly into a computer with USB cable that is supplied, But, they sound crappy and the distance is not very good when either linked into usb Bluetooth adapter, or linked to my cingulr 8525 cellphone the phone function sounds acceptable. The motorola version doesn't much better, Unfortunately the Cheap Logitech sound the best but the logitech suffer from the Weak Headband that breaks within 2-3months even if you baby it... So look I would look at other bluetooth headphones..."
1,Not really what you want,I got a defective purchase item here and am still awaiting the RMA from the seller. Not really a comfortable product to wear. Can't comment on the product as it has never worked to date. But I can say this was a bad buy in that the rig is not very comfortable to wear. I can say look to other products to meet your needs.
2,slick funtion,"first off, would give it a higher rating but, to tight, and low valume,, paired up very easy with my razr 3xx and does not sound to bad, I also connected to a Palm 750 treo but did not sound good from it ,, for audio books sound is ok but not good bass for music .The range of the bluetooth was better with the palm but is just fine with the razr ,I work in a machine shop and I can move around most of the shop but the mic picks up ALL unwanted noise,but ok if your in a quiet envirerment, the control funtions are very good and it is a slick device , just not worth more then around 40$"
4,They're pretty good.,"These headphones are pretty good. The sounds quality and performance of the phones themselves are really good. Unfortunately, it has a couple of little quirks that kind of annoy me. For instance, the lights on the side. They blink and glow to show what the headphones are doing. Now that's all well and good, but if they're on your head you can't see them blinking or shining anyway. You can turn this off after you turn it on, but you have to do it every time you use them.Also, I use them for my iPod. I don't know of this is the headphones, or the receiver, or if all products do this with the headphones, but sometimes the blue tooth signal drops out. If I turn my head suddenly or if there is a lot of clothing in between the transmitting device and the headphones, the signal comes and goes. Now this doesn't happen all the time and it could just be my transmitter."
4,Jabra BT 620s,"ProsThis product is good and it can be used with bluetooth enabled jabra A120s and the laptops(bluetooth enabled).Sound quality is good, stereo works fineConsThe pairing may get disabled sometimes, so you need to reset the headset.Summary:- Excellent product, good quality stereo sound"
1,Constant Pairing,You have to pair the device all the time with the adapter Jabra sells I would definitely stay away from this product.
4,VERY PLEASED,I liked to say I am very pleased with the product. The original headset had a defect. The customer service called me directly to inform me that they will be sending out a replacement express mail. I will definitely use thier services again.
4,Good headset!,I bought this yesterday and used it after charging. Pairing was very easy and once my music was on my Blackberry it played instantly. Sound quality is very good. I like the extra bass as some of these headsets sound flat. I am going to use this mainly for running so this will be nice. I have a smaller head and this fitted well but after 1/2 hour or so it starts to feel a bit tight. I think I will get used to it. I didnt like the flashing blue lights but you can turn it off. It would have been nicer with a small led instead. The music did cut out sometimes but repairing fixed it.
1,Totally... UN-impressed! Don't bother.,"I've heard some of the greatest voices, orchestras and sound systems live and via much less expensive headset equipment. This headset design almost shocked me with it's lack of sound quality. Absolutely no bass response and if you crank the volume at all you experience much distortion. If you are old enough to remember AM transistor radios... hang one on each ear and you'd get much better quality.Thinking I had a defective set, I'm writing this after returning the first and listening to my second set. Exactly the same quality from multiple audio sources. Basically cell phone call quality in stereo regardless of the source.A BIG don't bother!"
2,Not Compatible With All Mobile Phones,"The headset is a quality product. However, it is not compatible with all mobile phones. It was not until that I received it that I found out it was not compatible with my cell phone. Although the return process was easy and I was able to get credit, it would have been nice if there were a listing of which cell phones the device was compatible with its listing on Amazon."
1,woeful device ever,"I was attracted to this sorry piece of c**p because of reviews here and elsewhere. Jabra's website is a lesson in frustration, it won't let me download the latest software, is translated from some foreign tongue to English, and 'support' info they request does not even apply to my request! I am seriously considering ripping this thing to shreds and mailing it back to them! Jabra huh? well the J in their name stands for ""joke"".........."
1,"Uncomfortable, totally disappointment","In a very short time it makes ears ache, that is why it is very uncomfortable. And also not suitable for use with laptop via bluetooth. Because it is not well responsive .. you can't listen to a song without stopping a few times. (Dont even think watching a film, you cant bc not synchronized with video) And also it really does not make sense to use a headset which gives light constantly. With cell phone use again it stops responding sometimes although not as frequent as with laptop, which again does not make any sense to buy it. And it is too sensitive; stopping (whyever it stops!) goes to another song while the one is not finished yet. So, totally disappointment. Never ever think of buying it."
1,It dosesnt work without its usb bluetooth device,I connected to several laptops and its features didnt work. I did a test with and external usb bluetooth device and it works. Now i have to buy its usb bluetooth device to use it.!! Save your money!
1,Disapointed,No even a month of use and already it does not work!I am disapointed qith the quality of these headphones.
3,Works Great...at first. (Update),"Product works great. Shifts between music and calls seamlessly. Comfortable to wear. Sound is a lot better than I expected.5/26/11 - UpdateSadly, I bought 2 pairs of these headphones and only one sort of works now. One pair did not last beyond a year before I had difficulty pairing it, getting sound, and using the buttons. Even fully charged, it would randomly turn off. The second pair started having difficulty pairing and playing music, so it's been collecting dust for a while. I paid substantially less than what they are currently priced, so I would look around before buying. They worked okay for a while and were comfortable to wear for a little while, but then the weight would start hurting my ears."
4,"Great sound quality, ""different"" look","How big does your head have to be for these not to fit?? Anyway, not to be fooled, if you don't mind looking like a combo of uber geek and DJ funkypants these are great. Good sound quality at 30 feet, and they stay put. I have a pair and wear them proudly. Embrace your inner geek and listen to music without wires."
3,not great,"I had previously bought a pair of Scosche bluetooth headphones that had worked very well for over a year before they started acting up. Then I bought this pair of Jabra BT620's to replace it, but aside from the obvious issue of longevity, the Scosche were superiour headphones in two key ways:1) the Scosche had much better range (in receiving a clear signal from the transmitter)2) the Scosche are much more comfortable. The Jabras fit very tightly, even for my (relatively) small head.Hope that helps!"
2,flashing blue lights,The sound is okay;for me it needs more volume. The Blue flashing lights makes me feel like an alien and a perfect target for snipers.
2,nothing out of this world,"The jabra people does not say anything about what models of cell phones is compatible, for what I discovered for the motorolas they don't full work, you can only hear music but you cannot answer the calls, as for the sony ericcson it will only work for the latest models, I tried it with a K790 and it worked perfect but the sound quality gives a lot to talk about the product cause you can barely hear it even with the full volume."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"I have tried these on 2 different cell phones and on my Mac. It paired up with them just fine, however the audio quality was horrible. No low or high end, nor any dimension to the sound. I can't believe more reviewers haven't mentioned how bad the audio quality is. Build quality is fine. However, it's simply unlistenable. I'm returning them."
2,Incompatible with Blackberry Curve,"I just got my headphones. They worked for phone calls (with some static), but I couldn't play music through them. The buttons work as far as pausing and skipping songs, but no music through the headphones. I contacted Jabra and found out it isn't compatible with the Curve. Would've been nice to know ahead of time. These are a little expensive to be just a remote control for my phone's music player.Check the Jabra website before purchasing to make sure they are compatible. Just because your phone supports advanced audio doesn't mean these will work with it."
4,A little uncomfortable,I use the BT620s with the Jabra A125s adapter for the IPOD. Good combo and sounds fine once you adjust the EQ on the IPOD to get the high end frequency. Headphones are a little uncomforatble and look goofy. You sort of look like Princess Leah but if your > 50 who cares?
1,"loss synchonous, low talk quality product","1. There are loss signal when going on talk with mobile phone (Sometime), your voice will not hear and you will not hear the destination voice.2. It has echo voice at the destination (Low volumn isn't help)3. Not swich back to Stereo mode after talk end. (If you use with PC at the same time)I returned it to get the new one. for the first one, there are issue about power- Not cutoff a current when full charge. over 9 hours. (Risk to explosion)- Sometime it cannot be charge."
4,A Good Headset for the Price,"I had a Sony bluetooth for 3x the price of this one before, and this one is almost as powerful -- the flashing lights are annoying, and the buttons are confusing, but it has an incredible range and sound quality."
3,OK for the Price,"They are comfortable and do provide good sound quality. However, they have a tendency to cut out once in awaile which I have not figured out. I even bought another Jabra adaptor thinking that might be the problem, but they still intermittantly cut out for a few seconds every so often. I had an older closeout Kyocera bluetooth headset that does not cut out and has better sound fidelity. For the price I would say they are an OK value. Also, they do not pair up with my PDA cell phone without going through the set up every time. Once they are setup they work fine with both my PDA cell phone and Zune together at the same time. Sound quality through the microphone is also very good."
3,"The product does what it was designed to do, not impressed","A bit too bulky and unconfortable to wear, the plastic that sits on top of your ears is too thick so after a while wearing them you really want to throw them away.Good sound quality, good volume, easy to use, battery is long lasting, you can enjoy about 6-8 continus hrs of gaming and/or music listening with a single charge; if battery is running out you can always plug it to your usb and keep on listening while it re-charges.In the overall I like the product but its a bit unconfortable to wear for long periods."
1,Pairing Difficulties,"These are excellent for pairing with phones. However, my new Dell laptop didn't pair well with them at all. When listening to music, they were horrible sound quality and this was when I was sitting at the computer. Also, don't plan on using these for Skype. Even with the proper setting they don't work well. Also, when wearing them for long periods of time they really hurt the ears. I would recommend a different model of Jabra."
4,I like it,"not bad, there is one problem that when I connect it to the computer, I can use it to hear the music; however I cannot use it for internet meeting and talking!"
4,Oregon Climate,We used the book to determine which area to retire in Oregon. The book was very helpful for this purpose. It provided most of the information we needed to make a sound decision. It is well written with many good maps of the state.
4,The Astronomy Cafe: 365 Q's and A's,"Item was received in a timely manner and in good condition; however, I don't know how accurate the information is as of this year!"
3,Atlanta Pop Gospel,"After the vanishing act of Gospel Pace Music online, I didn't know where to pick up this CD. I attended Powerhouse when it was COGIC as a kid. I followed this choir through its recording career. They were surprisingly good, if not a bit raw in their execution. This release is definitely POP gospel. I could see ""Christian"" music groups of various denominations and ethnicities taking on these selections with few changes. The Pace Sisters' voices and sound are very prominent in the vocals. That alone makes this a departure from previous, ""good old-fashioned church"" Voices of Power recordings. --- If you like Kirk Franklin-esque gospel and Atlanta's own gospel sound, this is not a bad choice. BTW, the CD I ordered looks homemade and the tracks are out of order."
3,kids book,My son seemed to enjoy this book. I thought it was a little short for the price. I don't thiink I would purchase another if there is a series.
5,Vol Gnome Rocks!,"I bought this little guy as a present for my parents. We all went to Tennessee and I knew they would love him! My mother gushed over him when she opened the package and couldn't decide whether she wanted to keep him in the house or put him in the garden. Eventually she put him outside to guard her roses.He's held up outside through 2 tornados, flooding, and other general weather-related atrocities. Excellent purchase."
5,FOR KYLIE FANS,"Kylie has evolved from the disco dance favorite to the master diva of tekno-pop. Her transformation has been smooth as silk and as profound as the evolution the Beatles made from A Hard Days' Night to Sgt. Pepper. This collection covers the whole transition. Although I am not a big fan of all her music, the collection has all my favorites from the catchy I Should Be So Lucky, to the most infectuous song since Billy Jean in Can't Get You Out of My Head. The collection serves as a good primer for those not familiar with her catalogue as well. All in all, I had to have it. If you're a fan, it's a must."
3,"A nice collection, but not for everyone","Kylie Minogue shows, although she is not as big as Madonna, she has been in the music bussines for many years and that her music has changed over the years. After quiting Newbours she started her music career with singles such as 'The locomotion(1989)' and 'I should be so lucky(1988)'. These songs sound pretty out of date and fans will love songs like these, but many people who bought the album hoping to hear more like 'Can't get you out of my head(2002)', 'Chocolate(2004)' or 'I believe in you(2005)' will be dissointed by this release. The album really shows the way she changed over the years though and if you are looking for a nice overview of her music career, you will happy with this release cause you might have just found what were looking for."
5,Best Compilation Yet,I must say this is the best compilation of all Kylie's compilation album. Disc 1 are for old school fans and that'd be me. Disc 2 are her current hits. Granted that it's missing some singles that I thought should be in here but I guess because they weren't that high in the charts they weren't added. I don't care much for compilation albums because I have all of Kylie's albums but I couldn't pass up on her 2 new tracks which are brilliant!
4,Can't get her out of your head,"Many people here in Canada didn't hear anything from the dirty-disco-dancefloor-diva before her 2001 hit 'Can't get you out of my head', and they might be kinda disapointed.Most of the songs on this album are kitch, but in general I like it. The drastic change between disc 1 & 2 really feels good though. She gained maturity, but still sounds naive but oh so cute. I love her.Whenever you feel sad or depressed, my diagnosis is a good dose of Kylie Minogue !"
5,Kylie is the best,This Video collection is great with lots of videos from the early years and of course her new hits from Body Langauge and Light Years. If you're a fan then buy it now. I simply love it and will enjoy it from years to come.
2,"Hardly an ""Ultimate"" Kylie Collection!","In addition to other criticisms of this set (an edited Can't Get You Outta My Head video and leaving a number of videos off), the audio is only in 2.0 stereo. This is a big disappointment as her concert videos were released with 5.1 Dolby and DTS tracks. Also, full-frame versions of Slow and Red Blooded Woman were included when widescreen masters exist (and were included on the ""Money Can't Buy"" DVD). Finally, all the widescreen videos are non-anamorphic and look horrible when (if you have a widescreen television) you have to zoom in on the videos."
5,Buy this cd!,"Ultimate Kylie is a great cd with her more popular hits, as not all singles are included on here(Finer feelings, Word is out, Where is the feeling?,If you were with me now,Some kind of bliss, Cowboy Style, and Your disco needs you were some of the singles left off.) But even though it doesn't have all the singles it is still worth buying.I believe in you and giving you up are great songs and are great addtions to the cd. And it's great for US fans to finally be able to hear Where the wild roses grow. Buy this cd!"
4,Kylie on video,"as a fairly new Kylie fan, it was a lot of fun for me to see most of her videos for the first time ever, one after the other! The early videos are really embarrasing, especially ""The Locomotion"", but some of them have their charm like ""Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi"" and ""Got To Be Certain"". I really didn't like that my favorite Kylie song ever, ""Better The Devil You Know"", is represented here with such AWFUL sound quality. I'm not kidding, it's really bad. I don't understand why they couldn't just dub over it with the track from the Ultimate Kylie CD or something. Some of the early videos aren't in great quality either, ""Especially"" for you suffers ffrom too much brightness and contrast. Or maybe that's how the video was originally shot..?? But anyway, it's great to see Kylie's evolution, although i would have loved to have seen ""Finer Feelings"" and ""Some Kind of Bliss"" included."
3,DISC ONE IS SUITABLE FOR SKEET SHOOTING...,"... if you're a fan of the ""FEVER""-era Kylie, then skip this and go straight to Cathy Dennis' OOP ""Move To This"" CD before they all disappear - she was the songwriting genius who boosted Kylie into the pop-dance stratosphere with her worldwide smash ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head""."
2,"Hardly an ""Ultimate"" Collection","In addition to other criticisms of this set (an edited Can't Get You Outta My Head video and leaving a number of videos off), the audio is only in 2.0 stereo. This is a big disappointment as her concert videos were released with 5.1 Dolby and DTS tracks. Also, full-frame versions of Slow and Red Blooded Woman were included when widescreen masters exist (and were included on the ""Money Can't Buy"" DVD). Finally, all the widescreen videos are non-anamorphic and look horrible when (if you have a widescreen television) you have to zoom in on the videos."
2,Bad Aftertaste,"I take children's vitamins because I have a sensitive stomach. I bought these thinking they would be delicious, and I was right. However, it left a HORRIBLE vomit aftertaste in my mouth. I was scrambling to find a toothbrush. If these are for your children, they may never notice. But if they are for you... be warned :)"
2,Too hard,"We started using gummies because the chalky ones leave a lot of ""stuff"" in the kids' teeth. These Flintstones gummies however are hard to chew and also get stuck in the teeth. The kids don't like them because they're simply too hard. We'll stick with the Target brand gummies, soft and the perfect consistency."
3,Perils of Pauline,"I liked the trashy, dishy beginning to this book, but it got tedious. I didn't need to know every week's trials. It became like the Perils of Pauline as they were always in some dire predicament, yet somehow escaped. I also thought the ending was far too abrupt and therefore unsatisfying. Perhaps the style of this book was more popular when it was first published, as it does seem a bit dated now."
4,REVIEW - SAVAGES - by Shirley Conran,"Great book - too bad it seems to be out of circulation. But thanks to Amazon, it is now possible to find old if not forgotten books.The price was right, and although the pages were a little yellow - to me it only adds a certain antique charm - it was otherwise in ultra great shape."
4,Savages,"Savages by Shirley Conran is a glimpse into the lives of five pampered executive wives who have it all and want for nothing until they are thrust into a fight to survive and stay alive. Their spoiled and glamourous pasts have not given them any tools needed to exist in a Jungle and ocean full of hungry predators and heavily armed guerillas. From poisonous centipedes and deadly sea snakes to machete wielding mercenaries Savages will keep you spell bound and on the edge of your seat, page by page. I could not put it down."
2,No CD Rom Included,I could have purchased used copies of this item for less than $5.00.Instead I choose to spend $24 for this item because it is advertised with a CD ROM.The CD contains the MW Collegiate Dictionary 10th Edition plus a thesaurus.
3,A quick Read,"This is a good book - an enjoyable and easy read. It did give me the bug to try something similar - and that's why I read the book in the first place. Only thing is, this book is all B.C. (Before Children). I need the sequel to this book which will teach me how to make this trip After Chidren ( a bit more of a challenge). I recommend it if you are interested in making such a trip or life style change. Oh BTW, George W. Bush sucks and it's a total travisty that he won the 2000 election, Rush Limbaugh is a total idiot, and I really like Canadians - (Guess I didn't have to include that in the review -but I did and I feel much better now!)"
5,The BEST I've Ever Read!!,"I read the first book, Sister Light, Sister Dark, and couldn't wait to read the sequel. Now I have, and I am very anxious for a third book of the series. I love the books, and I wish I knew where to look for the 3rd one."
3,"White Jenna, inadequate sequel","White Jenna, by Jane Yolen, would have been a typical story if the main character were male. You know, defeat the bad guy single-handedly all the while adding in smart remarks and getting the girl in the end. Well it was like that except it was a female and she got the guy in the end. The three things that made it readable were, the amazing author, the fact that it was based and intermixed with Celtic folklore, and the wonderful prequel."
5,perfect,Dash mat came with everything needed to install. Fit is perfect on my 2000 Dodge Stratus. I would highly recommend
4,1997 Town and Country,"The product is what I wanted but what was sent did not fit my dash. I returned it and another one was sent, exactly like the first. My refund was prompt."
1,Screw you HBO,Seriously - 2.99 just to RENT a single episode? Every other TV show out there is less than that to BUY. Pass.
5,Best Show Ever....,"Best show ever created hands down!Not for those who are offended easily!I thought after the first season that this show would go downhill, it only get better. I promise, if you enjoyed the first season, then buy the second, you will be amazed at how the Kenny Powers journey goes from the end of the first season. Don't listen to the villagers hating on Kenny Powers, just buy the second season, thank me later."
3,It's Okayish,Loved the first season...the second season was boring and the story line was off for me... almost like it was made up as they went along...
1,Great Show - Horrible Price,This is a great show. Asking $21 to just rent these for 24 hours each is way over priced. I can buy the whole series on iTunes for that.
2,A little disappointing,The show itself is hilarious; the seller shipped it quick also. My problem is the price for what you get. There are only two disks in the season and only three episodes per disk! This should be sold much cheaper and as a bundle pack with the first season.
2,Nope. Completely blew it.,"I'm going to keep it short and (bitter)sweet:The series decides to grow a heart. All the hilarity from the first season goes down the drain here. Now, all of a sudden, KFP is out to win it all back, and to grow up. The series takes a shift from dark comedy/ politically incorrect to less-dark comedy/ still politically incorrect/forced jokes/ afterschool PSA.I am no longer interested in continuing to watch this series. For those that haven't watched the first season, it is an absolute riot, totally raunchy, yet still very funny. I can't say the same for this season."
3,Enjoyable but imperfect,"I liked the book enough to finish the rest of the series. However, the writing was not always clear. Also, I found the Choyan's to be too ""human."""
4,Unusually compelling,"While the book does have its flaws, I found it deeply addictive. It works more as a mystery than anything else, and leaves you constantly wondering. My one complaint is that it is very repetitive when it comes to describing the defining characteristics of the alien races, using nearly the same phrasing several times. Skipping these paragraphs is not difficult however, and overall I would highly recommend it."
1,Just not worth it at all,"I returned the initial charger because it did not work - right out of the packaging. Unfortunately, the replacement only works intermittently, and after 8 months of fiddling with how I insert the batteries, it now does not work at all. I think it is a problem with the charger. The lights only blink rapidly (which the manual indicates there is a problem). No amount of fiddling makes the charger work. Avoid."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Will not properly recharge 90 percent of the time. AA batteries work a little better. AAA batteries do not even bother, probably 99 percent failure rate."
3,Works but not on all battereis,This charger worked on most of my batteries but would indicate that some (mostly radio shack)batteries were unable to be charged. Yet they charge up fine in my wall charger. It also seems that the batteries charged with this unit can not be used as long as ones charged in a standard charger.Although it is not perfect if you use name brand rechargables this is great for keeping in your laptop bag. I also used this with a solar usb charger plugging the two together and it worked great on our camping trip.
2,Energizer battery charger contains backdoor - CERT Vulnerability Note VU#154421,"Install the software that comes with this and it can allow access to your system and files. Google the CERT for details. And if you buy/already have this charger at least don't install the software.CERT is located at Carnegie Mellon University and, among other things, acts as a clearing house for information pertaining to Internet-related security vulnerabilities."
4,A convenient charger,"I like this charger for rechargeable AA's and AAA's. It is very convenient to use when on the go, or even if you get tired of having to plug in a charger into the wall. Just plug it in your computer! The driver is plug-n-play for Windows XP and Vista, and offers a free software available that allows you to see how far along the battery status is coming along at [...] It also has a built light indicator to show how much longer it has to charge; the light indicator blinks faster as it gets near completion."
1,enter the annoying rapid blinking error mode frequently,"I don't recommend this charger. I bought one and ran into the two problems that reviewer QRagious mentioned. I went back to store and exchanged it with a new one, but the new one got the same problems.1) enter the annoying rapid blinking error mode frequently2) re-install usb driver every time it is plugged into the USB."
2,"Poor product, software contains Windows malware","This is a very poor product. On AC or USB I have to insert, remove, insert the AAA batteries several times to get a good connection. In addition, the software is crummy. The software seems to make getting a good connection harder.On Mac Snow Leopard there is a dashboard widget that doesn't seem to measure the charging process at all. There is also a kernel extension (.kext) installed, which I'm not too happy about.On Windows 7 the app does actually give some information about how long it will take to charge the batteries. The app also blinks red all the time for no apparent reason. ** Update - as of March 2010 the Windows software contains malware. Do not download or use the software. If you have already downloaded and used the software, check your computer with a good antivirus program. **If you get this, don't expect it to work well. Also, you will be better off if you don't install the software."
3,Frequently Fault-Finding,"As described in other reviews, the charger frequently goes into it's rapid blinking, charging error mode. I get same result with energizer rechargeable batteries and other brands. Typically I need to remove and re-insert batteries 3-4 times to get to full charge.It is also annoying that the charger tries to install its monitoring software every time it is plugged into the USB. My corporate PC disallows this installation, and I need to wait while the installation fails.Having said all that, it is a compact charger that works off the USB. I'd prefer one without these flaws, but this one does work."
1,Do not install software -- Has a trojan as of 2010 March 10,Software for the unit has a trojan that allows computer takeover.Energizer pulled both it and the software from the market.I would not purchase it until the software is updated.For information on the trojan and how to remove it:[...]
2,Hope you don't make the same mistakes I've made...,"is the topic of this book. It sounds cool, however the details were not provided. The author gave a single line where he should have made or hope for, but in moment of excitement he played an incorrect move and his opponent outplayed him in different single-line variation. Some lost games were due to his lack of experience or preparation, he confessed. The analysis was single-minded. As other reviewers wrote: errors, typos, and faulty analysis are many. With word processor and chess program available, the book is not up to standard. 5-6 USD for a used book is a better investment if you want a collection of chess mistakes."
1,A rambling collection of poor quality games,"Eric Schiller provides examples from 55 of his games - each one trying to illustrate an important lesson. However, the lessons are not particularly useful, the games are poor quality, and the analysis is faulty. As an example of one of his lessons ... ""Don't play unsound openings in a serious game"".To further reduce the enjoyment of this book, it is full of typos - one piece of analysis states that a piece can't go to the square c9! Many words are miss-spelled. This lack of basic editorial care is a flaw this book shares with others authored by Schilller and published by Cardoza, such as Standard Chess Openings."
5,now THIS'LL shed some light on the situation...,"Garrity makes excellent products. I should know--an old friend's brother in law owns the company. Garrity has always worked hard to put the best products on the market; and this flashlight is no exception.Garrity's flashlight here is far better than an average flashlight in the same price range. The Xenon bulb gives off a good deal of light so you can see your way around in the dark or light up dark spaces without any hassles. The flashlight is indeed water resistant although I can't comment about shock resistant--I never tested that one out! I admittedly wouldn't make a habit of soaking the flashlight in water, of course; then there is the chance the water would eventually erode it bit by bit.The flashlight operates using only 2 D size batteries; and even if yours doesn't come with the batteries they are inexpensive and easy to find in many stores.Overall, this Garrity flashlight is going to last you a good long time--I highly recommend it!"
3,Rosenthal tells a fantastic story in text book fashion,"Rosenthal's ""The Honest Courtesan"" tells the story of Veronica Franco, a 1500's courtesan (a high society prostitute) and poet. Franco's life is somewhat represented in the current movie ""Dangerous Beauty"". Franco was one of the first independant women of this time and wrote of women's equility. Unfortunatly, Franco's amazing story is told in a text book fashion. Rosenthal's writing is cold and uninteresting and reads like a doctoral dissertation. The subject matter is wonderful, but I would recommend Rosenthal's ""Veronica Franco, Poems and Selected Letters"". In this, Rosenthals writing the same, there is just less of it. The introduction briefly tells of Franco's life, and Franco's poetry brings her story to the reader."
3,disappointed,"I was hoping to find out about the remarkable life of Veronica Franco but instead was pummeled with quotes, references, repetition, and a string of Italian phrases. There's no doubt that this book is Rosenthal's dissertation. Hopefully one day it will be edited and condensed to 1/5 of its size."
3,"There are some good ideas in here, but not many","The few good ideas in here do make this worth the asking price. Just be prepared to leaf through this in order to get to the good stuff. I got much more out of Lou Paget's book, HOW TO GIVE HER ABSOLUTE PLEASURE. But, I would have still bought Wiseman's book because it has some good ideas on how to use sex toys on a woman to give her a different experience. It's always good to give her as many different techniques as you possibly can, and you will find a few of them here."
3,Please keep your pants up.,I bought two of these. The first one went to my son. Im sure he doesn't wear it. The second one was too big. I had to trim it down so it would fit. Odd sizes make it hard for a decent fit. Some modification maybe needed.
2,Not so super belt,"Belt is well made but the belting is so stiff, it will slip through the buckle. This might lead to ""Say no to crack"". I also have one of their HD models and it is far superior and will not slip, but only because of the velcro retaining material that connects the tail of the belt back to the part around your waist. Get the HD and it should last forever, or until the velcro passes away."
5,Sturdy & Stylish,"This belt is wide enough that it stays centered in the belt loops (ie. doesn't ride high in the belt loops as the day drags on). Triangular shape of the buckle makes it very easy to quickly thread the belt end into and through the buckle by folding it in half like a slice of pizza. Sturdy and stylish, I am pleased with this purchase."
5,Wow,"As a craftman, this is the book I turn to when I want to get the creative juices flowing. It is inspiring, better than design book 8. It is a compilation of the most wonderful, exquisite samples of woodcraft put together in one book. Not that you will love every piece, but you will be impressed by the mastery and creativity shown in every piece. There are no drawings, plans or detailed explanations, this is not about copying, it's about inspiring."
3,"Great photo quality, not very practical for an amature","Great photo quality of all the designs categorized by type. Almost 100 more photos than Design Book 6. Each design listed with creator, dimensions and wood type used. I was trying to get some ideas from the book, but only less than 30% the designs fall in my interests. Most of them are way difficult to make for someone like me who has only a little shop at home or require fancy tools (extreme skills). And some of the designs are just unpractical, they are not even good taste, only for showing off the skills in making them, I guess. I was able to get an idea on how different wood were used in the design to have certain artistic effect or looks to enhance the piece. But you have to guess what kind of finish was used on it."
5,Uniden GMR885-2CK GMRS--- Great radio,"Tested them out and its true. Took my boat out in the ocean and they work great at 5 miles. Haven't tested them yet in mountains.I'll be doing that soon. Very happy with this purchase from walmart. Everything is cheeper there. Well i been testing them and there a great radio. In the woods you get about 1.5 to 2 miles distance, depending on conditions. In around the wires and house in town about a mile. In open areas 3-4-5-6 miles. Yep I like it.*************Update:I have used these radios now for a year. They still work great. The longest distance I have got with them to date has been 18 miles. That was from one mountain top to another. Most times you will be lucky to get a mile in woods type cover. battery life has been great with rechargables that come with the unit. All day talking with a show of full battery at end of day."
4,8 Miles??,"8 Mile range?? Um, no. Maybe on the moon, with no atmosphere and flat land. In my area, which is all flat farmland, I get about 1-1.5 miles. Tops.Other than the range issue, these are great. Good quality reception, rechargeable, heavy duty."
4,beautiful photographs,What an absolutely beautiful book with details of each and every residence reviewed.The photos are spectacular and the layout is superb.A great gift for all Bali fans!
4,buena colección,"esta serie de libros son una buena colección de libros de mesa, lindas fotos, buen contenido. recomendado como todo lo de tachen"
5,A great memorial for an innocent victim,"The poem is beautiful and profound, and the artwork goes along with its own story to tell. The book is an excellent addition to any collection of literature that covers America's past with racial segregation. The book may be categorized as ""Children's"" or ""young adult"" literature, but adults (like me) will find it very impressive and informative (especially since the author and artist included notes in the back of the book)."
2,wreath for emmett Till,"Just not what I thought it was. My fault, I should have read the description more carefully."
1,The Deputy Complete Series a Disappointment...,"WE were very disappointed when we received this set of videos. It is advertised as colour, but when we got it it is all black and white. I thought maybe I missed it, but I went back to the Amazon website and it still states colour, so I did not misread it. I would not hve paid the money for a black and white set, so I am not sure how to deal with misrepresentations, but you should all know it is only black and white, NOT Colour! Good enough shows, I just hate black and white."
4,Nice Converter,"A great product, works as suggested. My only comment would be to have longer cables on it, so it is not so hard to adjust once it's plugged into the Head Unit."
1,Horible Product,The item arrived with loose wiring in terminal ends. Upon plugging the item in to factory harness it introduced static into the system then promptly shorted out several fuses on the panel this event locted my stereo into a safe protect mode which I had to get unlocked. I do not reccommend this item. Consider replacing your factory unit with aftermarket and doing it the right way before wasting your money here.
2,sized wrong,The description of the item stated it was a 3 inch inlet. It is not 3 inches. It is slightly smaller and will not fit on a 3 inch tail pipe. Quality is good. Wish it fit.
5,Playmobil Penguins (Set of eight),This was one of many Christmas gifts for my son. Product delivered as described. Seller provided fast shipment and excellent customer service. Thanks.
2,tries too hard,"I never clicked with this movie. I have seen many indie films that were wonderful - this is not one of them. Like the other reviewer who stated it feels as if you are actually there at the party, I felt that way. And if I was at that party, I would have found an excuse to walk away. There are some very interesting moments - but they fall flat because there is a missing element. Some of the acting is spot-on while others not so much. I would not recommend."
1,Movie lacks direction,"This film just did not entertain me. I regret the money I spent on renting it. It lacked an intriguing plot, its character development was lackluster, and overall was unengaging and not entertaining."
1,this movie 'sucked'!,This movie was contrived and confusing. I wanted to see for myself if the first two reviews were accurate; THEY WERE!!
1,I have trouble even writing a review,"There is no acting in this movie. The story is lame, at least the part I saw before I realized that there were so many other worthwhile things I could be doing with my life."
2,Keep trying.......,"Very handsome star and co-star but storyline did not flow and video was poor quality. Bad ending, would not watch again."
1,Nihilism?,"Is this film an exercise in Nihlism? I'm unsure. But it is certainly a dreary piece of work. I'm working my way through Matt Riddlehoover's ""body of work,"" and yes I realize the quotation marks there are bitchy, but while other of his works show some glimpse of talent, this one shows nothing--not even a clear look at his ridiculously handsome visage. Sure this film was made on a shoe string, and sure he was VERY young when he made it, but I've seen film school projects that were more interesting. I wish I could find out more about his upbringing and scholastic training. I have found nothing in his press coverage that explains his move from Bermuda, to Charleston, and then to Nashville. There must be a good story there, right? Maybe he should tell that story on film."
5,A gem,"The unlisted quartet here is the Travnicek Quartet and the players are truly excellent. Lively, witty, dramatic, spot on in every way. Furthermore they are aided by a superb quality recording. A real gem!"
1,A waste of time,"I spent the whole movie just expecting that the outcome would make up for the time I already knew I was losing in front of the tv, but seriously? This is the plot? There's anything outstanding here, anything that gives justification for the almost one hour and a half lost. I'd rather have done my nails. And I am a totally addict to movies!! Tumbs down."
1,The movie is a wreck,"Made no sense and I was bored out of my mind. The plot seemed to go nowhere, and never did until the end."
2,Only amazon prime worthy,If I had paid for this movie I would be pissed right now. The first Hour and 15 mins are dedicated to a man crawling around in the forest eating worms. After all that is taken care off there is only 12 min if that left in the movie. Just enough time for us to finally get a clue of what is going on.... blahh not worth an hour and thirty mins.
5,Wondering...,This movie kept us wondering thru the whole thing. Edge of your seat movie. We loved it and you will too.
4,A tale of survival... what would I do?,"I thought this movie was well done. Great acting by Adrian Brody.If you need movies to rip you out of your seat and throw you around the room the whole time, then this probably isn't for you.For those that thought it would be beneficial to just watch the first ten minutes, and then the last five, well, they missed some important parts of the movie.There are different types of 'thrilling' when one is trying to survive. Also interesting on what actions one might take based on who they thought they were.It definitely made me think of what would I do if in the same situation."
3,Suspenseful mystery,"Not your typical fare, especially for Adrien Brody. It starts out a little slowly, but does pick it up, All of the clues ultimately lead to a conclusion, but the end may change what you think."
3,"""To build a fire"" with a twist","This was not a bad movie, just a bit tough to follow (almost had a ""Momento"" feel to it), and painfully slow at times. If you've got two hours to burn, and aren't overly tired, pay attention, and you will enjoy the twist."
3,Long crawl in circles,"The Movies ""ok"" for a boring weekend watch. I also would not have paid for this at the Theater! 1 Thumbs up"
4,Let me think a lot of things,"I realized the smartest thing one can do is actually get himself out of the car by all means on the first day, not the third day. But he still make it."
4,"Excellent movie, for people with an IQ exceeding the double digits.","I enjoyed this movie from beginning to the end. It left enough room for interpretation by the viewer at the end. But I still loved the whole thing. I liked all of the characters, especially Duke. Very realistic, and very disturbing. Most of the negative reviews, you will notice, fast forwarded to the end or just turned it off after ten minutes. These types of movies are not for everyone. Some people have to have explosions and gunshots, or a very well defined, easy to follow plot. But if you have any powers of deduction, and a love for the outdoors, you will like this movie a lot."
3,Didn't quite make the grade,"When I first heard the song Seasons Change, I had to have this CD and searched all over the place for it. I ended up having to get it off the internet. Once I listned to it, I was a little disappointed. The lead singer has an incredible voice and the musicians are obviously very talented but the lyrics were trying just a little to hard to be ....something. They missed something (at least for me). And there could be a little more variety arrangements in some of the songs. I found myself being completely annoyed by some of the songs, but there 3 or 4 really good ones.I also bought the Spiritual War which came out before this one and it didn't necessarily grab me, but I can tell this is one of those groups that will just keep getting better as they go along."
3,Blew away in the wind,"I used this anchor on two consecutive days at the beach in NC. I screwed it in almost to the handle both days and my 7 ft.umbrella is vented, but the anchor blew out of the sand after about 30 minutes on each occasion. There was wind on the beach, but nowhere near 30 mph. Wonder how calm it needs to be to stay anchored? Should work fine on a hot, calm day :)"
3,Beach umbrella sand anchor,"This anchor is a good idea. If it were about 6""-12"" longer it would provide greater stability to the umbrella in windy conditions."
2,Didn't get what I ordered,"I thought I ordered what was displayed on the ad's photo - an anchor with a metal handle. I received an anchor with a plastic handle. I've read previously that other people get the same problem.It may work OK, but I did have the same anchor last year and the plastic handle snapped off.Amazon must be more careful to sell the product that is actually shown on the photo!"
1,blew away,"I used this anchor for less than 30 minutes before it, and my umbrella, blew into the lake and sank. One wind gust was all it took, and poof, everything was gone."
1,Didn't hold up on the beach,"Just returned from vacation at the Jersey shore. Used our new sand anchor for the first time and we were disappointed. We followed the directions and put the umbrella in the anchor. There was a light breeze blowing but it was nowhere near the 30 mph that the product claims it can withstand. Within an hour, the anchor began to loosen and soon after the umbrella blew off its stand. I would not recommend this product."
3,"Works okay, but not in high wind","I thought this sand anchor would be better than another one I purchased last year because it was longer. However, our 7 ft. umbrella with anchor attached, pulled out of the sand twice. In its defense, it was very windy. We found it worked better to dig about a 6 inch hole before starting to screw the anchor in the ground and then completely covering it with sand after securing the umbrella."
3,"Works OK, Great Construction","The anchor is very well made, however you need to screw it down really really far in the sand. It has an extra set of blades on top that help with this."
1,San Anchor,I ordered the product in question but did not receive the one in the picture. I returned the item and asked that you ship the correct item but all I got was a credit.I ordered the item in question but got the plastic version. You may ship the correct item and I will accept it.You pickers need to be more careful and if the item ordered is not instock then you need to advise to that the consumer may make a decision.
4,Great sand anchor!,I bought these before we went to the beach this summer and everyone thought I was nuts. As it turned out they were all jealous as soon as their umbrellas kept getting pulled out of the sand and mine didn't even budge.
4,worked well,First time buyer of this product decided to buy one somewhere in the middle price wise. I was very satisfied easy to put in and held up even in the wind.
1,Umbrella doesn't fit into the anchor,"The anchor is advetised and states on the package that it fits ALL umbrellas. It didn't fit mine. I tried to put the end of the umbrella pole into the anchor,and ait was too wide. Thereofe, it was useless."
1,Useless and unnecessary,"Amazon said that customers who purchased the 8 foot beach umbrella also purchased this anchor. So we bought it too. It does not work with this umbrella. The umbrella did not fit into the opening of the anchor. In addition, the umbrella was well designed and easily anchored on its own. We used the umbrella for 5 days on the beach at Herring Cove Beach in Cape Cod and did not have any problems. So don't buy the anchor if you are purchasing the 8 foot umbrella."
5,Beach umbrella anchor worked great for me,"I bought two of these anchors and used them recently down at South Padre beach in Texas. They worked great for me. Although they are made of some kind of plastic or polymer, they are extremely tough and I could turn them about as hard as I could. The two handles would bend, but I never got the feeling that they were even close to breaking.Based on the sand at the beach where we were, I was only able to get them screwed down into the sand so that the upper circle portion was just touching the sand. However, this proved to be more than adequate and they held up the umbrellas very well. Please note that the wind was not too heavy, so it certainly was not an extreme test.The other nice thing I liked about them, is that, when you're done, they pull out of the ground easily. The trick is to pull them STRAIGHT UP and, at least for me, they came up easily.This is a good product that certainly met my expectations."
1,very unhappy,I ordered this product because we have an old one that we use each summer at the beach. It prevents the umbrella from being picked up carried and even hurting someone near bythe new one is too small and doesn't work properly because of the size.I was really annoyed to think that I ordered it thinking that the product was the same and was disappointed to receive a small and ineffective one .I would advise against purchasing this product for the purpose of anchoring an umbrella in the sand.the older ones worked this one doesn't
3,Solid Stand,"Good stand, very solid. Be sure to check size of your umbrella pole before you get to the beach or it might not fit. This was sold on the same page as the Sportsbrella but its pole was too small for the adjustments of this stand. However, I have a stand size beach umbrella that fits into this just fine."
4,"Better to have, than to have not",This anchor definetly helps to hold your umbella up in the sand. The only reason I gave it four stars was because it is not totally necessary. It is a helping tool that makes life easier. Tip: make sure to twist and bury the anchor as far into the sand as you can.
3,Doesn't fit with an umbrella that already has a sand auger,"I can't use this anchor, even though the amazon entry says others bought this in addition to the 8' Rainbow beach umbrella (must be other fools like me!). The 8' Rainbow has an attached sand auger that makes it too big for this anchor. Because of the cost, I will not return it and will take my loss, but beware and take a good look at your umbrella before you spend your money on this. You may not need it (or be able to use it)."
2,Fair,It's a little frustrating that on mildly windy summer day in Coney Island the umbrella and the sand anchor will lift out of the sand and tumble down the beach. Perhaps it helps more then not using it...but not much!
4,A fun game that doen't take too long to play,My wife likes to play games so I bought this as a Christmas gift. A game doesn't take long. It is a good two player game and would recommend it.
4,Poor Shipping Container That resulted in Book Damage,"Corners of ""New Book"" were frayed due to insufficient protection of the packaging material for shipping. The book was shipped in a paper thin plastic bag. If one pays between 300 and 400% more for the cost of the book, shipping materials should be of such quality that the book is protected in route."
5,Tantriffic!,"This is a very nice compliation of electronic music in south asian themes. It's all real music and the editor managed to avoid tedious repetitive music. All cuts are densely layered pieces that you can listen to over and over. It's real music, too, not some computerized elevator music. If you like dancable lounge and chillout with a mysterious south asian and middle-eastern themes, then this is your album."
1,needs electric screwdriver to undo the screws on underside of chair,Boss mid back executive chair instructions are to first remove all screws and hardware on the underside of the seat. There are no packets of screws the screws were install prior to shipping to be removed and reused by the customer. Manually I could not budge even the first screw and hurt my wrist trying. Also note the back of the chair is material not leather and it looks tacky to me. In the picture it is a sharp looking chair. In real life it is not. There was no info online stating that these screws were machine tightened/installed. It looked like it would have been a comfortable chair had I been able to assemble it.
2,disappointed,"I bought this shirt as something to wear rather than a sweater when it's cool. I'm disappointed. Not only is it very boxy and unflattering, but the material is very rough, not like the corduroy I'm used to. I'll be donating this shirt to Goodwill."
3,A Good Start,I was interested in learning about cognitive interviewing techniques for law enforcement. This text is a good basic primer but really didn't get into the depth I was looking for. Its much better for someone without a good basic knowledge of interviewing.
4,nice casual shoes with a higher heel,"These are very nice quality shoes, though I don't know how comfortable they will be as they are almost 3inches high. I purchased these for only $23.89 & they look great with nice jeans or slacks, could also wear with casual skirts or dresses. I wear a size 8 or 8 1/2 shoe & they seem to be a tiny bit long in the length, but with warm socks they would be perfect. Definitely recommend Me Too shoes they have quality workmanship, & try to appeal to people who are on their feet all day, with cushioned insoles & flexible &/or lightweight soles.Update 2/10/07 these are not all day comfort heels, probably 2-4 hr shoes at most, because of heel height, toes slant to front of shoes causing a bit of pain, not limping pain but enough to cause discomfort, pretty w/longer slacks or jeans perfect for those times, when you want to be casual dressy."
3,not all that different,"i cant tell the diff from a stock one, maybe sounds a little meaner? dont think its worth the money"
4,K&N filter,"I always have good luck with these products. Don't know about increased horsepower, but the engine does breathe better and i don't have to replace the filter ."
5,music is your friend,"ohh what tunes to listen too. this is an album that will make you dance like a russian and then rock and shake your booty. finally it will fly you on an airplane, then rock you one more time. it is an audible treasure. give it a listen. you should like it. rock is your friend. if you look, you shall soon see another album. The donkey told me so."
5,DDD rocks,"Just a note: the reviews I've read here on this treat it as it's a brand spankin new album...it's not. It's actually a re-release. It was originally put out in 2000 i think... ANYWAYS..Ozma rocks. Simply put. I don't know how else to explain it, but Ozma rocks. And I don't know how some people say that they are Weezer copies. I don't find the similarities. But then again, I've only heard ""Island in the Sun,"" ""Buddy Holly,"" and ""Dope Nose."""
2,Where Did all the Good Toasters Go?,"Well, first of all, this toaster, like all the others I guess, was made in China. Second, quality control seems to be a problem. Mine works OK but takes several minutes to toast sourdough bread to a light brown. On one side. The heating elements are only on the outsides of the slots. Cheap! And don't think you can put a piece of rye or other oblong bread in there. You have to cut it or toast one area at a time. Will somebody please make a toaster again that regular, normal bread fits into? Or is there a toaster oven somewhere that isn't complete garbage? My search continues. Argggghhhh!"
1,Lever does not stay down,Surely the toaster looks great but the lever of our toaster won't stay down (although it was plugged in) - so there was no point for me to keep it.
1,Lever Will Not Stay Down,"I must have gotten a different toaster than the other reviewers. The lever will not stay down (and it has nothing to do with the feature of not staying down unless it's plugged in). The toaster is plugged in. It's going back. Very disappointed with this purchase, which is too bad since I like everything else -- the design, the lever location, the size. If a toaster won't toast, though -- it's a problem. I do not recommend at all."
5,Expose of Amway,"This is an outstanding and detailed expose of the Amway multi-level marketing phenomena. The whole idea is in the book's title: Fake It 'Til You Make It! Although I believe that Amway is a legitimate business and probably makes pretty decent products, the real money is made by the relatively few elite compared to the hundreds of thousands of people that have been involved in Amway through the years. This book exposes the fact that the real money is actually made by the Diamonds and above through the marketing of conventions, books, and tapes that people in their ""downline"" must obtain in order to be successful in their business."
4,Refreshing Music Mini-encyclopedia,"Aliki provides a broad synopsis of music-its place in history, cultures and the human heart-in this inspirational, informative volume. Each page consists of a collage of images united by a concise narrative.What is especially refreshing about this mini-encyclopedia of music is that Aliki ""bookends"" the mechanics and ""hardware""- types of instruments, who's who of Western composers, time lines of jazz and pop music - with ""software,"" placing music's emotional and social value into perspective for the child. She shows how music is the background of everyday life, for example, with this definition, ""Rhythm is a marching-band beat, a puffing-train beat, a beating-the eggs beat, a heart beat.""The book closes with a panoply of pictures demonstrating how music comforts and inspires, by helping people to relax, calm anger, cheer low spirits, and create or perform work."
4,Teaching aid.,"I bought this book specifically because it was an easy read for children. I was teaching a unit on jazz to a group of fourth grade students and found the brief history of jazz extremely useful. It broke the history down by decade, and mentioned an important fact or two about the decade. Charactures of musicians and names are mentioned too to help students identify musicians in the time periods and styles. The book overall is a great book to assist in introducing children to music, but I used it specifically for this lesson."
3,Teach your horse perfect manners,"kind of elementary for what i was expecting, but i suppose it would be helpful to someone at that level - all in all it is a pretty good book"
5,Just what I needed!,This fits my iron balcony railing perfectly.I have had no problem with it holding my heavy planter. Easy to install. Good price.
2,Buy the cheapest one,"Even if you plan to not move it or wind the cord or just as a back up, buy the cheapest one. I have three now and the all tend to break sooner or later. Find the cheapest one (there's one for $20 out there) and buy two. Two stars because if I didn't have it I could not write this review."
4,Good price but poorly packaged for shipping,"I purchased two ""Replacement Deck Spindle Pulley for MTD 756-0486"" [part 275-469]along with two ""MTD 717-0906 917-0906 Spindle Assembly Replacement Fits 42"" and 38"" Cut Decks"" [part 285-110] from Mowtown and they were all placed in one box for shipping. The unwrapped heavy items [Spindle Assemblies] were allowed to smash into the fragile unwrapped items [the Deck Spindle Pulleys] during shipping since they were all just thrown in the box together. It was a miracle that they were undamaged when I got them. But the parts worked fine and the price was very good so I am satisfied."
3,Watermark logo over the video :(,"I expect the low quality of the source material, but superimposing a logo over the video should be a criminal offense. And it's not even the company's name, it's the name of the box set. It's relatively faint compared to TV station logos, but it's completely unnecessary and distracting."
2,Life in the Womb: The Origin of Health and Disease,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever slogged through. Which is a shame, because the ideas are important and intriguing: epidemiology and animal experiments show that maternal undernourishment changes the pancreas and liver to prepare for a life of famine. Subsequent normal and especially abundant diets then result in late onset diabetes and heart disease. The fetus is also extremely susceptible to damage from alcohol and tobacco. Thus, the way to reduce diseases that are thought to be genetic is by proper maternal nourishment and hygiene.Now that you know what the book has to say, save your money and spend it on other equally interesting but better written books about late-onset disease: Why Animals Don't Get Heart Disease by Matthias Rath and any books by Dean Ornish or Robert Pritikin. Nathanielsz ignores pre-natal emotional stress which is touched on in Arthur Janov's works."
2,Poor circuit quality,The form factor is good and would be an excellent product if the audio quality did not degrade with usage. The product that received was used about 4hrs and then started to crackle and pop while playing off of an ipod. I let it cool for 30min and now it plays well on 20min cycles of playing and cooling. Mine is going to the Salvation Army shortly.Unfortunately I don't have any experience with other models in the same cost bracket.Good luck.
1,Didn't work,"The speakers only worked when plugged in--not when using batteries--which is kind of important when looking for a portable speaker. When it is plugged in, the sound is very quiet. If you buy it, get it from a brick and mortar store. Amazon returns are not worth the aggravation over a $10 item."
1,iron cover,very Hard to find...expensive to replace.my advice: do not buy the Brabantia brand iron...the only one that fits is its own brand and not the standard generic wide sized European ones that you can find in your local Bed Bath and Beyond.
3,Looks like the original.....but thinner.,"Having finally worn out the original cover, I purchased this replacement. While it maintains the same look of the original, it came with a much thiner pad, which I didn't think would be an issue until I started ironing with it. Now, all of my shirts have a very slight criss cross pattern on them, the result of the iron pressing through the cover to the metal mesh of the board. Not a huge deal, but enough for me to start looking again to see if I can find an original cover, thought I suspect that this is it. Seems like they cut corners on this replacement."
4,European deluxe replacement pad and cover,This did fit my ironing board well. Only draw back-pad is extremely thin. Much thinner than the original wish I had kept the originalpad and used it with the new pad.
3,"Yes, it's thin!","As others have stated before, the foam is not thick enough to make this an excellent ironing board cover. It is however a perfect fit for my ironing board and is easy to put on. I recommend buying the Brabantia Universal Replacement Felt Underlay - Ironing Board Pad to supplement. Then you will have the perfect ironing surface.As always, Amazon's service was excellent."
1,Definitely Not Worth the Money!,"The ""pad"", if you can call it that, is so thin there is no way it will cover the board. I had to double it up with another old cover that I had. I was initially happy to find that the Brabantia replacement ironing board cover was available on Amazon. I love my Brabantia ironing board, the larger size and ability to raise it to a high level really works. However, it is very difficult to find a decent cover. This one is not it! Brabantia should be ashamed to sell this as an adequate cover."
5,Tailor perfectly for the possivble situaiton,"This was a fine outing for the director's first attempt at making a movie. It is not a black male bashing movie which I am very proud of. The women did not seem like they needed a man to save them or to save a man. Also, no heavy overtones of calling to Jesus. We know he is on the mainline, but you have the ability to handle some of your own problems. Well done, I expect the same quality of and a progression in the director's directing ability."
1,Nothing Exciting about this play!!!! Such a waste of film!!!,This play had great actors but the play itself was garbage. It had no ending at all...slow at the beginning. Nothing about this play is exciting or even worth rating. I recommend no one to purchase this dvd.
3,Could of been better,I thought this play would be awesome because of the actors and actresses. The play was pretty good but the ending was horrible. It could of lasted longer but who knows. Besides the ending it was a good play.
4,The pass will find you,"This is a movie that make women face that to, will hide secrets and lie. The pass has a way to catch up to you."
2,Save your money,"I thought with the cast, this would've been a good play, but I was wrong. I love all the characters, but not in this, it was bad all around. It started out okay, but it didn't keep my interest. Since I paid my money for it, I watched the whole thing, but it was really a waste of time and money."
2,A BOREING PLAY,THE PLAY CAME ON TIME AND IT WAS IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.THE PLAY JUST WAS BOREING TO ME.THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE PLAYING IN IT. IT WAS JUST A BOREING STRIP.THAT'S JUST MY OPION.
1,I would give it ZERO stars if I could.,"Horrible book IMO. The author just seams to rehash the same constant babble that you hear from all the mainstream self help gurus. Only difference is this ""Author"" (and I use this term loosely) apparently has yet to grasp the complexity of the English language. The first page alone is riddled with obnoxious spelling errors and grammatical fallacies, it literally made my eyes bleed while I was reading it. Please avoid this trash at all cost, unless you plan on giving it to a blind person then I supposed no harm will come of this bile filth being reproduced."
3,NOT THE ORIGINAL VINYL ALBUM MIX,"SIMON AND GARFUNKEL FANS,EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A GREAT LIVE CD, DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY AT THIS TIME. WHEN THIS WAS RELEASED ON CD BACK IN THE MID 1980s THE DECISION WAS MADE TO EDIT DOWN THE MASTER TAPES OF THE 2 ALBUM SET VINYL VERSION SO IT WOULD FIT ON ONE CD. THIS MEANT EDITING ALMOST ALL OF THE FRIENDLY CHATTER BETWEEN THE SONGS AND THE AUDIENCE RESPONCE. IF THIS WERE REISSUED TODAY ALL OF THE ORIGINAL ALBUM MIX WOULD FIT ON ONE CD. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR NOW AND WAIT TILL THE FULL LENGTH CD IS RELEASED. I SUGGEST IF YOU FEEL YOU NEED THIS, GET ON E BAY AND BUY AN ORIGINAL 1981 ALBUM OR EVEN BETTER A CASSETTE OR REEL TO REEL FOR A GOOD QUALITY RECORDING OF THE ORIGINAL FULL LENGTH ALBUM. SOME BOOTLEG CD COPPIES OF THE ALBUM MIX HAVE BEEN SOLD ON E BAY."
4,Nostalgia,"The music brought me back to when I was young , in the 1960s. What a great selection from their concert in Central Park! I wanted this disc because I saw ""The 69th Street Bridge"" song sung by Art Garfunkel on U-Tube. All the magic of this duo is here on this CD. Their voices are still ""clear and young"", not like the albums they put out later in their career. If you want a trip down memory lane, get this CD."
3,"Great Live Concert, But Sound Quality Not As Expected","I saw the video of the Simon & Garfunkel Concert in Central Park. I love the classic songs and the dynamic live sound. So I ordered the CD thinking it would have the same sound quality. I was disappointed. The sound is very compressed, which could be a reflection of the technology used to record the live concert back in 1981. However, I also bought theirLive From New York City, 1967CD, and that recording sounds very good (maybe because it was recorded in Carnegie Hall). I think the Central Park live concert needs to be remastered for a fuller sound. If you love Simon & Garfunkel music, then you might not mind the sound quality. It is a great live concert."
2,Audio Problem,"The audio on this CD is terrible (""tinny"", low volume setting) I notice that it's imported from Austria, so perhaps the imported CD's have to be more carefully controlled. I see ""imported"" more and more on product descriptions."
5,One of my favorites,This tape should only be played through a stereo system...only then will it knock your socks off. And it will!
2,don't trust used CDs,"While the price was attractive, the expected quality was missing. The disc slips and repeats in several places making the listening experience less than acceptable."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this CD because I like live albums and I wanted another Simon and Garfunkel album. This was somewhat of a disappointment. I guess I didn't realize when I bought it that most of the songs are just Paul Simon. If you're really looking for a good Simon and Garfunkel album, go for The Best of Simon and Garfunkel."
2,"""In Concert"" not a favorite",I personally don't like how the songs don't sound like I remember them. I much rather the Greatest Hits CD.
5,Do Buy This,"I'm not going to gush that it's the best CD ever made, but it's certainly worth your $. There are a *ton* of great songs on here, and they're so funky--much more so than studio recordings! If you're finicky for polished performances and surround sound, you might get frustrated, but I'm pretty fussy when it comes to that and I still enjoy these performances immensely. This album is about as good as it gets with Simon and Garfunkel.Plus, there are very few songs you're going to want to skip over, so you're not going to find yourself with 8 minutes of music after you get to the good stuff. Even if you own every album/compilation and have every song, you'll want to hear the 'revved up' live versions. This is a great CD to bring on roadtrips--I drove from western CT to Rhode Island playing just this CD, and my friend and I had a blast. When you close your eyes, it's like you're there!"
3,Kind of weak,"It's not a bad album, certainly...but it definitely let me down. Art Garfunkel's voice had noticeably declined by the time this recording was made (complaint number 1). And it really hurts the whole album. On top of that, lots of beautiful string and horn arrangements we hear on the original studio albums are gone - replaced instead with an electric piano just dinking around. WHat's odd is that a horn section does play with them...so why do they sit out on songs like The BOxer? Good lord, they are incredibly vital to the song. The fact is, no matter what I may have to say that's disparaging, you still would be hard pressed to go wrong with this album. But just buy it with the understanding that it won't knock your socks off."
4,CD,"I received the order intact and at a good price, I would buy from this seller again. The actual album was not the one I thought it was, too acoustacal for my tastes but nice to have nevertheless."
5,A nice book,"Engaging and witty drawings. A well written story, with lots of fun and action. This is a top-notch book, and my kindergartener really enjoys it. But why is there a witch flying across the sky?"
1,FAKE,"Personally, i have to say the sticks that i got seems like the fake ones, the paint is really bad and smells really bad too. BAD"
2,Pretty but too slick,"This stick is well balanced, but the paint makes it a nightmare to hold on to...will not buy another painted stick again..."
1,NEVER RECEIVED ITEM ORDERED,"I never received this item. Sent several email to the seller requesting that it be sent again since it was showing that I should have received it.This item was ordered in September and I waited to see whether or not it would come. The time to file a claim has now expired (which I purposely did not want to do) because I do not believe that this was done intentionally. However, I would like to receive the item or have monies refunded."
5,"Little Rascals, Volume 4","I ordered this video last week and received it just a couple of days later...I was shocked at how fast the delivery time was, plus it was in excellent condition. Although I'm waiting on my grandchildren to come over so that we can watch it together, I know I won't be disappointed...after all, it IS the Little Rascals.Based on this experience alone, I highly recommend this seller. Thanks, Jay!"
4,Little Rascals Vol. 4,If you love the Little Rascals this Volume has three of the very best. My all time favorite is the Kid from Borneo. Spankie is outstanding as a 4 year old who steals the show.
5,Better than the Kingston Trio,"I first found the Shaw Brothers on a CD I bought at a Kingston Trio Concert. I had never heard of them before. The Shaw Brothers are as good as the Original Kingston Trio, and much better than the new version of the trio. The tie in with Debi Smith in this CD really adds to the overall variety of this disc. I now have 3 Shaw Brothers CD's on my car CD player, and am looking for more with new material. My wife and I would love to see them in person."
5,Terrific book for families of all (or no) religions,"Great step by step details on activities that will help bring your family closer together.Easy to follow instructions for weekly family nights that allow you to teach your kids YOUR VALUES, regardless of your religious background.A MUST HAVE for every family library."
1,This is Junk,This is a piece of junk. Absolute junk ... what you'd expect to find in a box of breakfast cereal ... a five cent item.
2,flimsy,"This chain was really flimsy. I ordered two, and the first one broke the second day I had it."
4,Good eyeglass holder,I give this item 4 stars. Nice and shinny. Not real gold perhaps gold plated. Does not look or feel flimsy. Good attachment to eyeglass.
4,I Love Shamrock Green,"For a long time, I have enjoyed romance fiction. Recently, I've developed an interest in historical subjects, and Jean Burr Bradley's Shamrock Green brought these two loves together. Her characters are real and vivid, and the plot moves rapidly. There is never a lull in the novel. I was so involved in the story until I felt like I was walking along the streets in New Orleans with a voodoo curse plaguing me and powerful men trying to run me out of town. But my knight in shining armor comes to my rescue willing to put his station in life and wealth on the line for a beautiful servant girl. I highly recommend this book."
1,"This ""Frog"" jumped ship","I bought this camera for snorkeling shots in The Bahamas.Before I ever hit the water, the battery compartment lock broke in two. I managed to work around that problem.The first roll of film didn't fully rewind.On the third roll, the rewinder motor went haywire. End of story.The underwater shots I did manage to get with it were pretty good. Above water, not so great.I found the information sent with this camera long on art and short on helpful information."
1,bring a different camera to the beach,"I bought this one because I had a pleasant experience with the former Lomo Lubitel and the cheap yet precise Smena. This Frog Eye has nothing to do with the good old Lomo name: Perhaps the name switch to Lomography implies a change in quality as well. First surprise, the flash cannot be put off or forced in. Not too bad because anyway the camera went berserk at its first roll: the flash it's not working anymore after only some 20 shots! The display indicates costantly that batteries are low, and when I changed the triple A doublet not only didn't solve the problem, but the frame counter restarted from zero. To add to this 59 $ disappointment, the image quality of the photographs is quite average, which makes one dream of the many top of the line disposables available. Spend your money sensibly!"
1,disappointment,"got at clearance from Nat'l Geographic - same problem with battery reading low, inconsistent flash and not being able to take more than 1 or 2 photos before everything just stopped. Returned it, looked for another but all the prices were higher. Think I'll look for another method."
3,Works for me,"After reading all the negative reviews I must have been lucky and got one of the good Frogeyes. I've run several rolls of film through mine without a problem. Lomos are not high quality cameras. They are cheap toy cameras. Even 4x6"" prints don't look so great from this camera. It does have a nice wide lens and it can shoot underwater so you can have some fun with it taking it places you would never consider taking your good camera."
2,"[inexpensive], but sounds it","I set up these speakers in a home theater. the price was right, but the sound wasn't. While they were certainly passable, and allowed you to hear the movie in surround sound, or listen to music, in comparison to other speakers they just aren't good enough.The sound from the main speakers was ""muddy"", lacked clarity and brightness. The subwoofer was distracting: not transparent and was clearly audible as a different speaker.... I would only consider these if you were on an extremely tight budget and this was all you could spend."
1,Extremely disappointing.,"This is not my first book about nonlinear time series and chaos theory and really i'm just wondering how it get published. I'm trying to find something positive to say but i cannot. I cannot recall what i did learn from it: just one thing, testing for reversibility. Ok, that's rather short for a book, a paper would have been sufficient, and less costly. I've just wasted my money on this. In addition, i'm not the kind of reviewer who is used to give 1 star to a good book, it has to be very bad to get that.Rather go to Kantz or Abarbanel for useful books on nonlinear time series analysis..."
5,"Dramatic, chaotic and yet analytic.","Seldomly I have read a book on this subject which was so clear and well written. Diks turns out to be a captivating writer, who does not scare away from truth, equations, or Greek letters. I'm waiting for part 2, to see how the story ends."
3,A different brand,"This is brand ""J.A. Henckels International"" instead of ""J.A. Henckels"". It's made in china with ""German Stainless Steel"". I didn't realize until I get it, disappointed."
3,"German Stainless Steel, but NOT made in Germany!","These are fine knives, but the advertising for them is deceptive. They are actually MADE IN CHINA from German Stainless Steel."
5,The most clearly written book about pricing...,"I'm in the process of starting a new business and was having a lot of difficulty with setting a price. So I started reading buying books about pricing....six in total. Well, I wish I had brought this book at the beginning. I was attracted to read it as it had a lot of positive feedback. I can see why. It is very comprehensive, with lots of examples. The authors focus is on making sure that you don't ever charge just one price. You must always offer different pricing options to maximise sales. Lots of examples and annecdotes. Really enjoyed it. (I've just seen that someone has written a one star rating for this book - don't be put off by that comment - you won't be disappointed atall with this book). Review by Conor Hannah, UK- Amazon customer for 10 years."
4,Another Ratzinger Ringer !,"Great book, Typically thorough and readable. Alot of time spent on addressing scholarly misconceptions. I haven't read a Ratzinger / Benedict book i haven't liked yet."
1,not what I was looking for,"I bought this CD because I read an article about him in Down Beat magazine. I'm always interested in jazz violin players so I gave this one a shot. The whole CD sounds like one long free jazz improv with no sense of meter or key. Really couldn't tell one song from the next and at the end of the disk there wasn't any part of it that stuck in my head. There wasn't any sense or melody, harmony, groove or anything to make me want to listen to it again. It just doesn't connect with me at all... END"
3,good movie..... bad actors (except Mimi Rogers),"the movie is well told,... I guess the only problem i had was the actress who stared in it I can't even remember her name she over acted to much and cared more about herself than other people around her."
5,great family movie,"Good movie especially for teens. The only parts I didn't like were the goofy ""romantic"" scenes between Ed Begley and Mimi Rogers...they had absolutely no on-screen chemistry. The interaction between the girl and the horse is great. Worthwhile."
4,Heartwarming Movie,Wonderful Movie about a girl who loses her ability to walk along with a Dark Race horse.
3,A very casual game only hardcore fans would have enjoyed.,"Man, when I was a kid, I was on vacation in Sacramento when I saw this game & wasted my entire vacation budget on it. When I got home, well, it's not worth the $40 my mom paid for it.Pros: The dance to the music, the original music for the character montages, some of dressups, large variety of sliding puzzles, & the 3D blasting game was fun.Cons: You can't extract mp3s of the montage music, browsing through the game files I noticed that the Chibi-Chibi dressup & many clothing options had been put into the game but cut & made unplayable, many of the paper dolls had clothes that clashed color wise & it had no option to recolor the clothing which would have been awesome, the 3D game is repetitive & gets old fast, & there is relatively very little 3D in the whole thing. In the end, you do everything about 3 times & it has no replay value until the nostalgia kicks in 10 years latter."
3,"Cute game, but could have been better...","I received this as a Christmas gift over a decade ago, and was giddy about it because I was such a huge Sailor Moon fan! I still enjoy Sailor Moon, but looking back, this game was rather lackluster. It does not have a lot of content, so you can beat this game fairly quickly. The replay value is okay, since you do not have to play the entire game throughout to beat it. It's a better game for little kids than adults, and if you really like Sailor Moon and want a better game, I recommend Sailormoon S: Another Story (released on the SNES platform) or the Sailormoon Fuwa Fuwa Panic games (released for the same platform)"
5,Get This SailorMoon Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It is fun!!!!!! But it will not let you go to more than 2 games.Because it stops you.I Love sailormoon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Fun potty book.,Caught my son's imagination. First reading and then he had us act it out. He assigned us all animal characters with him in the end being the little boy who fit just right. Set in the jungle with African animals outside of an African village so the little boy who fits just right is an African toddler. I changed some of the text when I read it to him so all of the animals were friendly toward each other and not scarry since we were reading it at night time or when we were on the potty. Not scarry as is though just made them a little nicer! :)
3,A Zebra shouldn't be sitting on a potty,This book has a decent concept - little boys and girls are special because they get to sit on a potty. But seeing animals try to sit on it is just weird and my kids didn't enjoy it so we no longer read it.
1,"Deceptive Advertising, BEWARE!","I ordered the 24 lb. S.P.R.I. weight bar listed on this website for $44.99. My order confirms that I ordered the 24 lb. bar, however, they sent me the 18 lb. bar. When I called to say that there had been a error with my shipment I was told that the 24 lb. bars were not something they stocked and that I could return the bar for a refund if I liked. I was also told not to reorder the 24 lb. bar from the website even though it is still listed as available because the same thing will happen again. I am very disappointed that they purposely sent me out the wrong product hoping I wouldn't care and haven't bothered to remove the unavailable product from their website. To me, this is false advertising and Amazon shouldn't be tolerating this type of deceptive sales from their vendors."
4,A Readable Collection of First-Hand Accounts,"This is an easily read collection of first hand remembrances of the loss of the first carrier Lexington, CV2. The author has gathered a large number of accounts from both crew members of the Lexington and from those on the escorting vessels. The book is divided into two parts - the first focusing on the attack on the carrier when there was hope she would survive and the second focusing on the events leading to her loss. An enjoyable book that gives an insight into what it was like to serve on a carrier in the early days of WWII."
5,Amazing,"I purchesed this notebook in November and it is working perfectly. It has a great screen and a very fast 2.0 GHz. This notebook is a bit heavy though at 7 lbs. It is not a big detail though, whth all af its other great features, it won't matter at all. This notebook is great with word procesers, which is a big part in my life because I love to write. I also love photography and this notebook has great photo editing programs. This is an overall great notebook."
4,Works for me.,"After considerable research, I bought the ze5170 as a desktop replacement. I like HP engineering, and this machine has only reinforced that sentiment. There is only one flaw and that is the not-so-DVD-friendly Mobility graphics card. It stutters at some chapter changes and with certain kinds of subtitles. Reducing resolution to the minimum tends to fix this, but then the picture isn't quite as sharp as it might be. Still, DVDs are very watchable, especially for the occasional viewer. The two fans can get a little noisey, but they also serve as a reminder of HP's persnickediness about tolerances - most other manufacturers just let your legs or (worse) the electronics bake. Keep this one in mind."
2,could cry,"Nothing but trouble. It never worked from the day I got it. Had it repaired, 6 months later hard drive is clicking and fans not working. Lost hard drive. HP says ship it back. I said - it's under warranty right, you fixed it 6 months ago. She says no it is not under warranty. Repair is warrantied for 90 days. ""90 days???"" I said. ""Well, there is obviously a REASON"" you won't warranty your products or repair for more than 90 days.Isn't there?"
1,Sadly disappointed...,"We bought this PC for my father-inlaw. He does not want to be a PC expert. He wants to send email, surf the web, buy things from Amazon, watch some DVDs and listen to music. This PC has been nothing but trouble. DVDs did not play at all. After checking out the HP user forums, a full reinstall was the answer. Merry Christmas, Dad! Failed startups are common, reboots if you plug/unplug power during startup, screen flicker, and rotten online support have made this a really poor experience. I encourage you to go to the HP user forums and see the problems that people are having with this unit. It does not seem like I got the one bad apple. Good luck."
2,Problems...,"I bought this laptop in Sept of 2002. It worked great for the first six months - then the problems started. First, the screen flicker (which is resolved by pushing on the cord that connects the screen to the unit, but it's a stopgap measure that only works for 1-2 days before you have to do it again). In late January, the laptop powered settings virtually destroyed the system - HP tech support's only resolution was to do a system restore. Because the disks are ONLY system restore, and not an actual copy of XP, I couldn't reinstall (which would've solved the problem). I lost everything since my previous backup - 3 weeks of e-mail and documents.Lately, the fan has started to become noisy and the DVD drive spins when a disk is in, regardless of whether or not I'm accessing the drive. No disk, no spin, but if a disk is in, it'll spin for no reason.HP's solution is for me to pack it up and ship it to them, leaving me without my laptop for 6 weeks."
5,Great Bible!,This Bible is a great size and has a durable cover. Have had this Bible before--it lasted 10+ years with daily usage.
2,Sixties Sunshine,"Looking for a gentle reminder of the sort of pop that sixties parents endorsed? Here we have a well produced and competently played middle-of-the-road sixties pop confection. Pleasant, if unmemorable, songs with harmonies, strings, workman-like brass charts and saccharine sentiments. Sometimes re-issue labels sneak the word 'psychedelic' into the mix for albums like this, presumably to lure ""Nuggets"" fans: there is nothing here more dangerous than a lace cravat. Admittedly the final track mentions 'going insane' and has some vaguely 'acid' effects, but it is all very gentle. Fans of the Mamas and Papas or The Partridge Family might enjoy."
1,Astral Scene~ The Astral Projection,"Do not buy this album believing it to be by the Israeli dance/trance duo, Astral Projection. It has nothing to do with them. It is by THE Astral Projection and I have reported it to Amazon as their search criteria is very misleading."
3,"Good for baking, otherwise lumpy","The powder is really fine, so it mixes into baking nicely. I use it with regular milk in pumpkin pie (instead of condensed milk) and the pie is just as tasty. But, when trying to mix it into liquid to drink I couldn't get it smooth, even when I used a whisk. I put it through a fine sieve (which is more work than justified) and even that didn't entirely smooth it out.Good for baking as a dry ingredient, not so much for drinking."
3,Needs to be updated,"I was not surprised to see that one of the issues raised by previous reviewers is whether or not this book is still relevant, given the enormous improvements in computing since this book was written. While I recognize that there are a lot of good ideas in this book, I must say that far too much of the text is devoted to techniques that are only relevant if one is doing data analysis on paper. This is certainly not to slander Tukey's own extensive knowledge of computing -- simply an admission of the fact that when EDA was written, few readers would have had access to any computing resources, let alone anything comparable to those that are available today. Today, the books suffers for this. A new version of this book, updated to take advantage of today's computing resources, would be quite valuable."
3,Super Reader,"Jimgrim is Major James Schuyler Grim. He is in Jerusalem, and is doing his heroic best to keep a lid on things. With all the factions and religions and races floating around the place, he definitely has his hands full. Enlisting the aid of an amateur or two, he wants to stop a nut that possesses a large amount of TNT before he destroys something historic."
3,Not all pipes and drums,"It is somewhat misleading to title this Scottish Pipes. Yes, the pipes are there, but not on all the tracks. There is also brass and wind, without the pipes. The mix of music is good, and, all the tunes are well played."
3,Don't buy this product!,"It is clear that this product was not sufficiently or fully tested.I am so frustrated that if I could throw a bushel of rotten eggs at the programmers and everyone else responsible for the time I'm wasting, I would.I have completed my federal and state return, and I'm ready to file the return. But the program insists that I need to check for updates, which I have done already, and again, and again, and again just trying to find a way out of this horrible programming do-loop."
2,Hopefully you don't need your refund right away!,"I bought TaxCut for the Mac based on reviews on this site. I am one of those people who do their taxes right away - and what did I get for my efforts? The software informs me that a necessary update won't be ready until mid-February. And it does not allow you to file until you update. I even tried to eliminate my charitable contributions (which is what the update said it was waiting for) and it STILL wouldn't let me send it.In addition, TaxCut for State (Illinois) was suppose to be available for download 1/28. It is now the 2nd of February and I am still waiting. I tried talking to two separate people via their live Help on their website, but neither of them knew when the update or the state would be released.I would stick to any of the free online tax sites that the IRS suggests on their web site, or head on over to TurboTax.Very disappointing."
2,"Not Fast, Not Easy, Pray It's Accrurate",Most reviews I have read say that this is the best tax software for the Macintosh. That is a very sad state of affairs.
2,Vapid and poor production qualities,"This book appears to be a set of photocopies of a book in the public domain. The photographs are almost impossible to discern. There are many pages that are just plain missing!!!!The book itself gives a brief overview of McKinley's life and career. It was written shortly after he was assassinated, though, and reads like a long eulogy. As a matter of fact, page after page is filled with directly quoted excerpts of actual eulogies given at the time of his death.Interesting historical artifact. Not serious history."
1,I had many problems with this unit......,"This unit was one of the most frustrating purchases of my life. ...This unit had problems from the beginning. First, it wouldn't save the preset radio stations sometimes. Second, it wouldn't read recorded CD's that I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM WITH ON ANY OTHER CD PLAYER. I always copy my CD's from originals in 4x speed and I never have any other problems. Third, sometimes a scratchy sound would be audible. Fourth, for the price of this unit I would of expected better headphones than the dollar carnival prize that came with this player. Fifth, the battery life was about 6 hours for CD playing. Finally, the G-shock protection didn't work at all and CD player would only work in a complete stationary position.Bottom Line: Maybe I just got a bad one but it seems like that happens way to often with Sony products."
1,worst cd player ever,this is the worst cd player ever. it skiped when i walked with it ad it has bad battery life. i do not recomed this cd player to any one! and it is over priced.
3,Max Factor colour perfection lipstick,"Max Factor must have gone out of business - or merged and changed names ? I don't know, but you can't find this brand in stores anymore. I had used one particular shade for years and loved it, didn't want to change - even though my particular shade name and number was advertised it was not what I got. I cannot use the shade they sent me - it turns crimson red when it has been on my lips for a while. But I didn't pay very much for this purchase - so ""buyer beware!"""
1,Not 100% Cotton!,"The sheet is only 55% cotton and the rest is polyester. It was not mentioned in the product description, so be careful if you are looking for a 100% cotton product as I do! It is definitely over priced compared to the other 100% cotton crib sheet being sold at Amazon. The look was ok, but not really that impressing either. I would not buy again."
5,Good Idea,"This single circuit transfer switch is a good idea with people with limited access to their electrical systems. I am using it for a circuit other than the furnace and it worked great. VERY easy to install, plenty of pig tail on the wiring. And well made."
4,easy install and it works,"getting ready to go hiking yesterday, 5 degrees out, and I'm thinking how much I like having a new generator (Hyundai) and a new furnace (Weil Mclain.) Then it dawned on me I got this switch a few days ago, and it's bright and sunny, and I may as well install the thing. Well, it was around an hour. I tried running the furnace off my inverter/deep cycle/solar panel set up, and it worked.Note...do make sure you have your main power switch OFF before installing this. I only needed it off for 10 minutes or less, assembly of the plug took maybe 30. Pricing has been strange. $70-$100-$70-$100 since I saw this. Try to get it at the $70 level."
2,Did not work on oil burning furnace with 5000w generator,"Connected to 5000w generator after Hurricane Sandy. 15amp circuit kept popping and oil burner never fired up. I have an oil burning furnace, my electrician said the burner might have been drawing more to fire up?...no clue. I read reviews, had it installed and found out the hard way that it does not work."
5,Transfere Switch - Simple to use and works!,"i always wanted to have the ability to run our LP furnace if we lost power. We live in Sun Prairie, WI just North of Madison. I already had a small 1800 watt portable generator, so all I needed was the transfer switch. The Reliance Controls TF151W Easy/Tran Single-Circuit was just what I was looking for. I had a licensed electrician install it to make sure it was done to code. Before he left, we tested the switch with the generator and the furnace worked like a charm. Cost of electrician $120.00. Peace of mind priceless."
3,"Interesting, but not great","I read both The Passion and The Promise. While I thought both books were interesting, I thought the werewolves were complete snobs. They treated humans as little more than trained dogs. It made all the loup garou very hard to like, and made the reader want to thumb their noses right back at the wolves, and say ""Same to you, buddy.""Luckily for me, I bought this book at a used bookstore, so I was able to trade it back in for credit. I'd have been really disappointed if I'd paid full price."
4,The Promise - Donna Boyd,"The PromiseIf you read The Passion, then you will enjoy this book. It is written in a similar manner and picks up straight from where The Passion left off. The only complaint I have is I would like to see another one to find out the outcome of all the decisions.Overall, The Passion was a better book, but she does do a wonderful job with Werewolves. Other reviews compare what she did with werewolves to what Anne Rice did with Vampires. It is true. VERY TRUE. She makes them real, smart and sexy."
2,The Promise - Very dissapointing and boring,"I picked this book up on whim and wished I hadn't. I don't ever read this genre of writing, which is probably why I didn't enjoy it. After about page 2 I was bored with the thing as the author went on and on about how werewolves are responsible for everything from rocket science to bubble gum. It got so completely nauseating that I couldn't even finish it and actually threw the book away, which I have never done. The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it was well written and imaginative, but I personally couldn't get into it. I must be more old-fashioned than I like to think."
4,Crimes Against Commerce,"Written by Pulitzer-prize nominated author E.D. Easley, ""Crimes Against Commerce"", is a cynical and hilarious look at life.Stretch, an atheist, travels back and forth between heaven and hell. Sharing his journey are, both God and Devil, Elvis, aliens, a mob killer, gang thugs, an IRS agent, a lieutenant governor, and more. Despite the fact that there isn't a trailer dweller in the whole crazy bunch, I found it to be a very enjoyable, giggle provoking, over the top, read.If gritty language is not a barrier for your reading pleasure, I wholeheartedly recommend this book. It is written in an ""every man"" style --no pretense here.By the time you reach the last page, you will have a profound understanding that, sh*t does indeed happen."
2,dough enhancer,"Contains milk solids, make sure this is what you want before you buy...not as good a bargain as it seemed"
5,My wife loves it.,"I am buying this product for 2 years now, and if I am not ordering it in time....So I agree with all those people with bad experiences.My wife bakes our bread every second day.She is kneading the dough by hand, leaving it to raise than again.It becomes an enormous size bread finally, and I cant eat the publix bread no more.The secret could be the kneading, the warm weather,(Florida) or the spelt, but without this mix,it does not raise that much.So I am keep buying it.This is strictly my opinion, all the others could be right."
4,Dough Enhancer,I was excited to see this available on Amazon. I used the bag and was happy with the product. I am not sure I would buy it again only becaue I am not that much of a bread maker.
1,Not Gluten Free,"I am rating this as a one because it is not GF. I had a different experience with Barry Farms than the previous person. I called Barry Farms as soon as I received my product. I,too, needed GF. They were extremely friendly and are giving me a full refund. The woman explained to me that their distributor for the GF product stopped producing, and they are trying to resource. They know that they need to change the Amazon picture."
1,Buy from King Arthur Flour,Barry Farm charges insane shipping for poor quality goods! King Arthur is very responsive and will rectify any customer issues promptly.
5,great,I love this dough enhancer. I've been using it in my bread for years. I like having one pound bags so that I'm not opening a huge amount all at once.
4,WHAT???,"Even though this is not the product that I recieved from the company, I have used the Aqua Pocket Mask in other areas of my career in healthcare and it worked great. It has a really durable one way air valve. I do suggest thoroughly cleaning and replacing filters after every use."
4,Nicely Done,"Great breath control, enunciation and timing Mr. Manuel gives us a great release which grabs the listener and sings, I mean really sings to you. Not for everyone, but definately a quality musician. Check it out."
2,Graphics Great......But Doesn't Stick To Wall!,"Thought this would be great for my son. We bought a darth vader and a yoda! Pretty pricey but looked cool. After reading the instructions we put them on the walls. I squeegied the heck out of them but after an hour or so I found them on the floor. Tried agin but to no avail. Our walls are clean...we had just painted them a month ago. Maybe that was the problem. Anyway, my son loved them so much we ended up stapling them to the walls. I would not buy again though."
1,Wrong Wrong Wrong,"This book says the exact opposite of every Chinese astrology book I have ever read. The only way this book can be accurate, is if you take it's interpretations and think the exact opposite of what it is saying. I am returning this book tomorrow. It WILL NOT be joining my collection of books. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ANYTHING THIS BOOK SAYS. It is so very wrong and such a big waste of time and money."
5,Outstanding Ensemble Playing,"City Rhythym Orchestra has had a strong local following in the Philadelphia area for a number of years. In their first release they demonstrated why. While the members are eminently capable soloists, the band is the thing with the City Rhythym Orchestra. When you hear them swing, you know that it's more than just a collection of players put together that evening."
5,A very comprensive book,"I'm a High School Junior and I read this since the information the internet provided wasn't enough.It's a great book! It contains lots of information, such as a step by step guide on how to fill the commmon app, how to make a great essay, how to market yourself to college, and more.If you are just going to buy 1 or 2 books on college applications, make this your choice.Parents: If your child is still in middle school, buy this book now. You'll learn a lot on how to direct your child."
2,Geared toward extraordinary students,"My son is bright but not brilliant - gets A's and B's in Honors courses but hasn't taken any AP or IB courses. He loves to play sports but isn't good enough to be on his high school teams. He tried a few clubs but nothing interested him enough to get involved. He's your average kid who spends his free time with a group of friends, playing pickup games of different sports, video games and poker. He's never had a unique passion or hobby. After reading this book, I became depressed."
4,A useful tool,"I picked up this book not knowing what to expect, with only the willingness to finish some apps. If you have a low GPA, low test scores, low involvement in school, etc. this book will not get you into a good college. What this book will do, however, is tell you how to accentuate your positive attributes, how to show off the intellectual curiosity and passion that the elite universities look for. Including sections on describing extracurriculars, sample essays, tips on filling out the forms themselves, and information on the general admissions process, the book proved quite useful.PS: As for myself, I got into Columbia, Duke, Williams, and a number of other colleges; I feel books like this played a key role in refining my applications to make me look my very best."
5,Essential book for high school seniors,"This book is basically an instruction manual for applying to college. I particularly like the step-by-step instructions for filling out the common application form, and I think that the advice throughout is sound. The book is very thorough, well organized, and written in a way that will be easy for teens to use. I really think that this book is essential for kids who are applying to private colleges.The only reservations I have is that the book does not alway make clear what is imperative, and what is merely an opinion of the author. As a parent, I would recommend supplementing the book with other sources of information to help get a better understanding of the process."
2,NOT AT FULL TILT,"Agreed, Milhaud (1892-1974) is a genuinely gifted, quirky composer; yet, as imaginative as he is, he can also be uneven. String Quartets No. 1, Op. 5 (1912) and No. 2, Op. 16 (1914-15) suffer from such rather lean inspiration--- the Arriaga ensemble helping matters none the better with their angularity, monochromaticism and questionable intonation. Under the circumstances, these works need the best ""coaxing"" they can receive: perhaps the Emersons or, at the least, the Kodalys. Here, though, the quartets fall dismally flat and hollow. Worst of all is the horrendous metallic sound. This, alone, makes the CD entirely unacceptable, regardless of the dubious performances or the compositions themselves.[Running time: 57:57]"
2,low in carbs and taste,I wasn't thrilled with the wrap. I definiatly have had better. They aren't that easy to wrap.
5,"years later, great memories","i read this book when it first came out and still can't say enough nice things about it. i'm glad it's in the world when i'm in the world so i could read it. it's funny, powerful, poetic, sad, pitch-perfect. a great book forever."
1,Contived,"Let's be bluntly honest: this novel is phony...the prose is affected and contrived...Olmstead once again capitalizes on his broad knowledge of literary fiction. He has a talent for manipulating anyone that reads his work...but if you read this as a writer, you will smell the stink pretty fast."
1,"Don't buy! It is just part of ""The Genius of Lady Day""","I was able to buy this DVD in a shop in The Netherlands and now I spot it at Amazon.First I thought again a new DVD of Lady Day, Billie Holiday. Let's hope this time complete films and no editing and messing around. But this DVD is a disaster!It is a very poor documentary which contains material ""stolen"" from other DVD's. This documentary lasts only a little more than 30 minutes AND it is just the first item that is present on the more useful DVD ""The Genius of Lady Day"".Unfortunately there isn't much film material left of Billie Holiday, one of America's most important popular singers.I do hope however that someday there will come out a DVD that will contain all the complete TV shows taken in the USA and in Europe, the Count Basie Short, and sequences from her other films.Theo Kuijpers, Netherlands, devoted Billie Holiday fan for more than 25 years!"
4,Great Read,"This is the first book of a trilogy about 3 brother who were orphaned and separated at young ages. My Steadfast Heart is about the oldest brother, Colin, and his lifelong search for his brothers. Along the way he meets Mercedes, a penniless aristocrat trying to save her cousins and the family inheritance. Sparks fly when Colin claims her family's estate as payment for her uncle's gambling debts. Find out how these brothers persevere and find each other. Ms. Goodman is excellent at creating rich, humorous plots and characters. If you are a Jo Goodman fan, you will this book."
3,Does the job...,"I bought this unit because I was replacing my factory audio components with new head unit/speakers, etc. I wanted something to keep the factory sounds, and ensure the databus was left intact. This unit seemed to fit the bill because it allowed you to completely bypass the integrated amp/speakers altogether. The unit works fine, but there are three problems.1) It doesn't sound like the factory unit (minor)...it is very close.2) It makes a very high pitched whine when I start the engine, almost like alternator noise is getting into the system.3) It does not give all warning chimes. I left my parking brake partially engaged, and it did not warn that they were on.If you do want to replace your components, then this will get the job done, but it does have some shortcomings."
4,Move Over David Sedaris!,"Streaking at Harvard is a wonderfully humorous account of a young man contending with life's ups and downs. From searching for West Virginia ancestors in ""Deliverence Country"", to staring-down Queen Elizabeth at Ascot, to explaining a radio ad for Trojans to his children, Chris Smith writes with a marvelous style that keeps the reader turning the pages eager to find out what's going to happen next. Move over David Sedaris, a new humor writer has appeared!"
2,Review,"Seems to work about the same as most other homeopathic gas relievers, multiple doses are generally necessary. The reason for the 2 stars is because the taste is foul. Really, if you have a weak stomach or very senstive to flavors I don't recommend it. I keep mints around and pop one at the same time."
1,No one should hate Tennessee!,"I will say now that there is no reason in the world for anyone to hate Tennessee. If you are looking at this, then you need to check your self!"
1,couldn't recommend it.,"With a title like this, the author is shooting himself in the foot. He must not want to sell many copies. But what do you expect from an Alabama sportswriter?"
1,Whoever wrote this book is a Communist,"I must say that the people running this website are nothing but a bunch of pinko commies if they are selling garbage like this book. This book contains blasphemy, no one should mock God's team; the Tennessee Vols."
1,ummm....i understand,Any one that hates Tennessee is just plain ole jealous. Tennessee is such a powerhouse its understandable that people like you hate Tennessee. I see...I see... You are from or for Alabama. Well that explains everything now. I totally understand your hatred for Tennessee. Hey maybe next year. You think. GO VOLS!!!!!!!
3,"Good, but a lot of info dated","The book does a pretty good job covering Goldfish varieties. But, some sections, such as the one on environment are very dated (1950s-60s era diagrams and pictures aquarium products)"
4,nice reference,"Death is never easy to talk about or deal with. This book does offer some helpful suggestions; especiallyon the kinds of things to say or not say to someone who is grieving. Also it tells you how you can reallybe helpful instead of just stating ""call me if you need anything"", like the book says ""they will never call"".I think we all could use advice or suggestions in dealing with this delicate matter, so I find this bookto be helpful."
2,"Good for contractors, not for home buyers","I purchased this book thinking that it would be a good resource for remodelling a home, I was wrong. The information contained is good for a contractor that wants to develop a ""green building"" image, complete with advise for dealing with media, marketing strategies and sales. It appears to have very little practical advise with regard to green building techniques and supplies. It might be a good reference for a contractor but not very helpful for the ecologically minded home buyer."
1,Micromax version holds in moisture too much- causes mildew.,"I have the version of this soil that says it has ""Micromax"" in it. I have left the bag open for months and the stuff will not dry out. That's not right and it makes me wonder what chemicals make it do that. I have successfully grown herbs in pots for years, but this soil causes mildew on top of the plants. I'm going back to mixing my own potting soil. ""Soil"" that doesn't ever dry out isn't real soil."
5,Excellent Mix!,"I absolutely love this. Ideally, you want soil that is light and fluffy so it doesn't bog down your plants -- that's exactly what I got but better. My plants are growing beautifully and I can thank Miracle Gro. The mix came moisturized and was very easy to handle. No wood pieces, no moss-like texture, it was uniform, rich in nutrients and has fantastic texture. It really keeps the moisture locked, so it will help you, especially if you tend to forget to water your plants, just don't make that a habbit. Overall, I would recommed this product to amateur and experienced gardeners. It's the best mix I've ever bought - worth every penny."
1,Don't buy this,This is a total waste of money. I grew a few vegetables and flowering plants with this soil and the gnat that came with the soil destroyed everything. I lost a whole batch of plants and wasted a whole month because of this.
1,"Peat moss, anyone?","I thought I was buying a high quality product because it had the ""Miracle Grow""name on it. But what I got was a product that is 99% peat moss with MiracleGrow nutrients added in.I haven't a clue if this stuff has the ability to grow anything."
1,Bad Product,Beware..Do not use this potting soil. All of my potted plants are stunted and barely thriving. The root balls do not expand into the soil. I have been gardening for over 25 years and this is my first unsuccessful year. I will never use this soil again.
5,TRUE LOVE ALWAYS WINS IN THE END,"This wonderful addition to Ms. Criswells works from the old west runs true with ""True Love"". Miss Emily Bartlett shows Jess Murdock just how wonderful love can truly be between the right two people. This heartwarming story will keep you reading til it's finished. A wonderful way to spend some quiet time! Can't wait for her next book!! All of Criswell's works are tops on my list of historical westerns. Enjoy them all."
5,Alice in Chains,This is nice greatest hits album for anyone who just wants to the more mainstream music from these guys. Happy with my purchase.
2,Buy Best of the Box instead,"I could never understand why this album came out a year after Nothing Safe: The Best of the Box. All the songs on this disc (except Heaven Beside You) are found on NSBOTB. PLUS you get the AMAZING Get Born Again and 5 other songs not found on this CD. Don't waste your money on this one. Alice in Chains are possibly the greatest band of all time, don't get me wrong....I just don't think this measures up value-wise to the other possibilities."
2,Weak...,"Alice In Chains was an unbelievable band, and trying to abridge their work on to one cd is impossible. To fully appreicate this band, you should buy their five studio recordings as well as their unplugged show. If you must buy a single disc compilation by the group, you'll be much better off with ""Nothing Safe"". It has almost every song on this album plus a few more songs. This disc does contain some excellent music, but it doesn't do justice to one of the best bands of all time. It's just not enough."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,It is a pretty pointless compilation of 10 of AIC's hit songs. Its a horrible compilation and it barley covers any ground. Its really just the 10 songs radio ate up. It doesn't do this great band any justice and doesn't even provide the casual fan with a solid selection of songs. Nothing Safe: The Best Of The Box is a much better Best Of album. There are more songs on there than on this and its about the same price and it provides the casual fans with a good selection of songs that sums up the bands career. Do not buy this. Buy Nothing Safe instead and get your money's worth.
1,Zero stars,I loved this band. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 10 songs? Are you serious. I would never buy this.
1,?????,AIC don't have enough good meterial to do a greatest hits.....every song on here soungs exactally like the previous ones with the lame vocal whiney wail over and over. AIC wuh yeaaa yeaa yeaa yeaa yeaa yuh yeaa yeaa sucks.
3,Greatest Hits from Alice In Chains,"I guess I should have gone with ""Nothing Safe"". Only half of the smash hits from Alice in Chains are found in ""Greatest Hits."" Yes, Man in the Box and Rooster are featured here, but ""Nothing Safe"" has more songs. After hearing this CD, however, the next time I'm interested in a rock band, I'm going to have to buy all of their official albums. Alice in Chains is one of the ultimate grunge/metal bands of our time, and I don't think a compilation album, especially ""Greatest Hits"", is appropriate. I'll see if I can purchase ""Facelift"" and ""Dirt"" anytime soon."
3,Pretty good.,"Sound quality is great on my b&k; / b&w; 2.1 system. Loses stars because they put the censored version of Man in the Box instead of the standard that we all know and love. I see no reason for that at all.Also, can't hear the violins in the stereo version of ""I Stay Away."""
3,Forget this one and get Best of the Box instead.,"It has 10 of their hits, but The Best of the Box has 15 songs, plus new hit ""Get Born Again"". So I would use your money for that one. This isn't a bad collection, just incomplete."
2,"ill ""stay away"" too...stay away from this.","10 songs on a greatest hits album? what a joke. why buy this when you can buy nothing safe, best of the box and get all of these same songs and them some. i own EVERY AIC album and nothing safe is by far my favorite. dirt is pretty cool too so that may be worth checking into. i didnt care too much for their unplugged set...but seriously, avoid this album like the plague."
2,Only 10 songs????NOT A GOOD COMPILATION....,"This is definitelly not a good compilation....Only got 10 songs....And only 1 song from FACELIFT, and 3 from the TRIPOD????If you really only want the mega hits MAN IN THE BOX and WOULD, they are here....but there's lots of great songs missing...SEA OF SORROW, WE DIE YOUNG, BLEED THE FREAK, RAIN WHEN I DIE, DOWN IN A HOLE, NUTSHELL....The truth is, buy FACELIFT, DIRT and JAR OF FLIES...3 masterpieces...and than buy the TRIPOD...ALICE IN CHAINS got way too much good stuff to be in a mediocre compilation with only 10 songs."
2,Awful Sound Quality,"I love the music, but the bass on this CD is almost nonexistent. If the sound of this band doesn't hit you in the chest with hard rock bass, then you're missing most of what makes it so great to listen to. I used to have the original recordings, and now I'm kicking myself for not keeping them. As others have suggested, buy their other disks--this one is a mess!"
2,Best Move On,"Trying to reduce AIC's output to 10 tracks is like trying to reduce Zep or The Stones to 20 tracks- hang it up. So what I was hoping for, since I have all their original cd's, was something sonically superior. What I got was a very uneven sound that moved from marginally dynamic with a briefly decent inter-song soundstage, to completely lifeless as though it was being streamed from a 128k mp3- ouch! And the results have been the same from system to system. And no- grunge is not about sounding shoddy.Somebody with decent hearing/sacd mixing skills desperately needs to redo this one- or better yet do the whole catalog."
4,Missing Stuff,"4-stars because it's AIC, But this is missing ""Down in Hole,"" and ""Got Me Wrong."" One the good side, not even Nothing Safe has ""Heaven Beside you."" I would prefer Nothing Safe, but this is a little cheaper. A basic Greatest Hits album."
3,I stay away,"I know pretty much every reviewer of this cd has said the same thing, but I cant stress this enough: stay away from this cd. nothing safe has 9 out of 10 of these songs plus 5 more, including 'get born again.' there really is no reason to buy this unless you are absolutly new to AIC and want to buy some, seeing that this one is cheaper than nothing safe. I give it 3 stars because every song on here is classic AIC, I just take away 2 stars for the shoddy marketing."
3,"Decent album, but the fred durst wanna be is killing me","I'm a huge Alice in chains fan, having grown up in the 80's metal seen, this band is one of the seattle seen grunge bands that killed my beloved hair-metal. None the less they grew on me heavily throughout the 90's and became my favorite band. To make a long story short yeah!, a few songs are left off but out of shear respect for a great band give a purchase, I think we all owe the late great Lane Staley that much. And now for this goof with the rediculous reviews. You unfortunately know nothing about metal, and it shows. Leave the reviews for persons with a little knowledge of the subject, metal is about power and volume. Not all the DJ scratchin ""crap"" that it has turned into. Give bands like Iron Maiden, Queensryche,and Judas Priest a listen before your pie-hole opens with more bad reviews"
4,10 songs for $10,I just wanted to say that i admire Alice In Chains alot they are one of my favorite bands this is a good c.d. but it could have used a little more work like a few more songs yet i have and and i listen to it so yeah its good but not great if you want Alice In Chains in their best performance get the Dirt C.D. if you want all their hits then this is the C.D. yet this isnt all their hits just a peep
3,"Great songs, bad ""hits"" package.","I assume the band had nothing to do with this release. Though all the songs are excellent, get their ""other"" best of instead. Why? Because ""Nothing Safe"" has 15 tracks, a few rare ones, and probably costs about the same if you shop around. It will fit much better between your ""Nirvana"" and ""Soundgarden"" best of's. Plus the cover doesn't look like a ""House of Pain"" disc. And if you need an AIC fix, get Jerry Cantrell's new cd."
3,You get what you pay for.,...If was not for this CD I would not be the AIC fan that I am today. You don't hear them on the radio so this ...CD was a great way to introduce me to their music.3 stars b/c if you are thinking about buying some AIC music but your not sure how much you like them it is a cheap sampler.And if you are a die hard AIC fan this is not an album that you need to purchase b/c you'll already own all of the songs.
2,One question: Why?,"It's too bad that the last five years have brought us no new album or even any news that the band is still even around. There's an ""Unplugged"" album, a box set, a best-of from the box set, a live album and now a greatest hits album. That's FIVE releases with nothing new! And these songs can be found on any of their albums in original form, too. Also, there are only 10 songs here. You'd think that with today's greatest hits CDs containing at least 12 songs (some have as many as 20 and, in the case of Chuck Berry, 28), there would be more here. And there certainly could have been more, too. I mean, where's ""Got Me Wrong""? Where's ""Down in a Hole""? Where's ""We Die Young""? Where's ""It Ain't Like That""? Where's ""Sea of Sorrow""? Hey guys, why not come out of hiding and give us some new stuff?"
3,Only Average,"Up front, I love Alice in Chains.The problem here is that this collection isn't very....definative. There arte loads of hits and great songs by AIC not even on this. It should have 20 songs, not only 10.I guess it's alright for a casual fan, but otherwise, search for more otions."
2,Unimpressed,"I can hardly see what benefit getting this particular album on SACD may be. Save your money and look at some others. I felt the same way about the Aerosmith ""Big Ones"" double SACD - it was extremely disappointing as well."
3,Where's the bass?,"This is an excellent selection of songs but an anemic job of re-mastering. I'm certain bass guitar was recorded in the original tracking sessions but where is it now? Material of this caliber deserves to be presented in a way that almost scares people when played loud. In other words, it should be given the respect it's due."
1,alice in pains,"i love alice in chains this is the worst SACD i have ever heard. mixed terribly, the origonal disc sounds sooooooooo much better."
1,Do NOT buy.,"There is absolutely no reason for anybody to own this album. It's not supported by the band. Its song selection pales in comparison to that on ""Nothing Safe: Best Of The Box"" (which, incidentally, IS supported by the band and contains more material). It isn't at all adventerous (once again, unlike ""Nothing Safe""). The ONLY two things present here that aren't on ""Nothing Safe"" are: 1) a song called ""Heaven Beside You"" (and if you love that song and MUST have it, you still don't have to get this, get ""Unplugged"" instead) and 2) a studio version of ""Rooster"" (""Nothing Safe"" includes an incredibly good live version of the song). On the other hand, this CD does NOT include ""Got Me Wrong"", ""Get Born Again"", ""We Die Young"", ""What The Hell Have I"" and (for some strange reason) one of AiC's biggest hits, ""Down In A Hole"". Spend a little more money and get ""Nothing Safe"" instead... you'll be glad you did."
1,greatest?,"How could you have a greatest hits album missing some of the absolute best Alice in Chains tracks like ""Down in a Hole"", ""Nutshell"" and ""Whale & Wasp""? You are better off getting DIRT and JAR OF FLIES instead of this stuff."
3,Whats the point of buying this,"we all know this album lacks a couple of songs released by AIC like We Die Young, Sea Of Sorrow, and Down In A Hole. the songs are great but the songs in the album aren't the only greatest hits. if you want a greatest hits album by this band get Nothing Safe, it has more songs. I'M A HUGE AIC fan but this is a waste of money. i have every album of theirs, so for those who want to buy this album just for the sake of getting everything the band releases, then don't. it just a waste of money."
2,Doesn't Do Them Justice!,"I am a HUGE Alice In Chains fan, and have been since 1990. This compilation CD doesn't even come CLOSE to doing the band it's justice. Any music fan that was alive from 1990-1995 knows how much of an impact their music had on the era, and the music since (Layne Staley's voice seems to be all over the songs of other bands now!). If you are just getting into the band, go buy Facelift first, and then work your way down the chain to the self-titled album of 1995. You might also want to get the Live album, since we unfortunately will no longer be able to see them live (R.I.P., Layne. We'll all miss you!). Music Bank has some cool outtakes and B-sides as well, but the albums from 1990-1995 will cover most of what you need to know."
1,I wish I could give them less than one star!!!,"I love Alice in Chains. Alot. They rock! Check out their Unplugged DVD if you disagree. BUT, (a BIG but here) this compilation is obviously a record label project and most likely has nothing to do with AiC. It probably played like this: ""Record Exec: You guys have signed a 10 record deal with us and we haven't heard anything from you at all. | Band Rep: So just throw together another compilation of their old songs, I don't care. | Record Exec: Let's put together all their hits - that should make a killing!""You get the picture. Don't buy this CD unless you like supporting record label execs' fat salaries. Or unless you like hearing the same old stuff that's been over played on the radio a guh-jillian times.Try Facelift, Sap EP (for 'Got Me Wrong'), or the one with the 3-legged dog on it. Those are real albums.Better still, dig around the recent MP3 apps for bootlegs or unreleased tracks. DON'T SETTLE FOR THE SAME OLD, OVERPLAYED TUNES !!!JUST SAY NO !!!"
1,Why God why?,"Don't get me wrong, I love Alice in Chains with all my heart, but Columbia Records is once again milking the greatness that was AIC in a way to make more money off a once great band. The ten songs on here are great, but with there allready being an Unplugged album, the excellent ""Nothing Safe: Best of the Box"" album, the ""Music Bank"" box set, and last years ""Live"" album, there is absolutely no need for this. If you don't own all their albums and just want a greatest hits collection, skip this and get ""Nothing Safe""."
3,10 songs? wtf?,"I now have everything AIC has ever done, and this was the first cd I got but later As I got further involved with AIC I began 2 wonder why only 10 songs. Minus ""Again"" these are probibly AIC's biggest hits but not there only ones. ""We Die Young"", ""Got Me Wrong"", ""Down in a Hole"", ""Nutshell"", ""Over Now"", ""What the Hell Have I"", ""Get Born Again"". just to name a few. I have a hard time convincing ppl that AIC was a great band when they have a greatest hits album with only 10 songs. That maks you look bad. If u wanna get into AIC I would say ""Nothing Safe"" is your best bet. Im not even entirly sure y this was released. ""The Essential Alice In Chains"" was supposed to be released over 2 years ago and still waits to hit cd shelves. It is 2 discs and has close to 25 songs. Thats more like it. But I guess this is yet another album required 4 AIC fanatics."
4,Lacking Compilation...,"Every song on here is great, so for that it earns five stars, but it should have many more...I mean for God's sake at least include ""Down In a Hole"", ""We Die Young"", and ""Got Me Wrong""! So for the lack of quantity it loses a star.I mean 10 songs it not enough to define the ""greatest hits"" of one of the greatest bands of all time.If you're looking for a ""best of"" something to get introduced to AIC with, pick up the much better ""Nothing Safe: The Best of the Box"", which has 9 of these ten plus more."
3,"Decent, but missing many songs.","This album is preatty good but it's missing songs. I don't own this album but i've heard all of the songs of this album. They are all good but what happened to Dam that river, Rain when I die, Down in a hole, Sickman, Dirt, Rotten apple, Nutshell, Whale and wasp, and Bleed the freak? Those are missing from this album. This would be a lot better if it had those songs. To have better AIC collection, get Facelift, Dirt, and Jar of flies. I have em, why don't you loosers that have this album buy them instead?"
3,about half the album it should have been,"This is 1/2 the album it should have been. Not much from facelift and very little from their EP's... Pretty much best of Dirt and very little else. Therefore, IF YOU OWN DIRT DONT BUY THIS!5 for content.. 1 for LACK of content.."
1,Terrible Chicken!,"We bought this chicken this weekend for our Goldendoodle puppy as a ""souvenir"" from our trip to Myrtle Beach. He chewed the nose off within the first minute, the foot was gone within 5. Although he loves this chicken, we had to take it from him because little plastic pieces keep coming off it. Did I mention that he just got it yesterday? 10 Bucks for 1 day of play is not a bargain. I'm not sure what kind of dog this was tested for, but our puppy made mincemeat of it in no time! Skip this chicken!"
5,Good dog,My dog loves this toy. But have watch them play with it so tear it up just like with any other toy
1,Creativity is no substitute for Truth,"The author plays very loose with foreign word meanings (read , he makes up word deffinitions to give credence to his theology). I do know Biblical Hebrew. Its quite obvious this author does not, but that does not stop him from making up Hebrew meanings for words. The words often aren't even Hebrew ! He does admit to using a lot of Arabic words. Unfortuanately I don't know Arabic. But if his translation of Arabic is anything like his Hebrew, its a complete waste of time to read it. The author does deserve an ""A"" for his creativity in weaving the gospel message out of every astrological sign and star and in twisting it far beyond its orignal intent. I'm am certain he could find the gospel message in any document."
4,Brief and direct,"This book on Biblical Astronomy is clear, concise, and avoids the trappings of literary psychobable that can often invade manuscripts on such broad subjects. This book (like The Gospel in the Stars by Joseph A. Seiss) is a MUST HAVE for anyone interested in Biblical Astronomy. Because of its direct nature beginning students of Biblical Astronomy will benefit greatly."
4,Inspiring,"Knowing that the God of the Universe has everything regarding his plan laid out in the stars, reafirmed my thoughts that I am so blessed to have HIM in my life and that HE has all things in his control. This book really was an incredible eye opener."
5,Very enlightening,This is an easy to read book which explains God's plan of salvation in the stars. Much better than the horoscope!!
2,God's Voice in the Stars,"This is the 2nd book I have ordered under this title. I appreciate the message in it. If a person truly wants to know the story of the ""Zodiac"" they should read this book...God's plan of Salvation is written in the heavens and He has made known to inhabitants of the earth what His celestial message is. It is an amazing story with texts from the Bible to back up these facts. Fascinating! God is the author of Creation and made everything beautiful and perfect, laying a perfect plan of Salvation for everyone who believes Him. Order this book, you'll be amazed!"
3,Just OK,This was just an ok movie. The story line lacked and was alittle stale. The only good thing about this was Matthew Montgomery which the movie was worth getting for fans of his.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I am a fan of Matthew Montgomery and was quite disappointed in this film. The plot was disjointed and the acting a bit strained. I did not really appreciate the lead female character (Eddy Malone played by Rebekah Kochan) very much. She was absolutely grating and not worth her agent's time. The last 15 minutes of the film were, in my judgment, the best of the entire movie. If you are a Montgomery fan I think you will be disappointed in this film."
3,very bad directing,"i have never seen matthew so badly served as in this flick: i mean, he really stinks and the director should have told him. this is a very cheap-indie flick with poor production values, poor acting, poor writing, poor everything. skip it!"
2,ok movie,"The story the movie try's to tell is one I very much wanted to love, unfortunately the writing wasn't up to the task. The pacing of the movie also seemed to struggle a bit. The actors did the best they could with what they had to work with, but I found it painful at times to watch."
1,Booooringgg,"This movie is slow, boring and predictable. The acting is not great, except for Rebekah Kochan of course, love her, she should be A-list. What I found funny is how they called Matthew Montgomery, whose acting is not bad, a hot guy. This is not a porno of course, but again, since the story line is boring, you would at least want the lead character to be a good looking guy. Other movies Matthew was in were more captivating so his looks didn't matter (to me). If this movie gets any good reviews, it is only thanks to Rebekah, gotta love her! Of course you don't have to agree with me, so form your own opinion and respect other's."
2,Sad ... and really boring,"i usually love these actors, so I bought the movie. I really wish I hadn't. There was just no ""fun"", just really boring. find Mr. Wright could have been so good but it was just ... just."
3,Easy Way To Spend An Afternoon,"I bought Finding Mr Wright purely because of Rebekah Kochan. I think she's a great actress and comedian. I watched the film yesterday and found it to be a decent romantic comedy about a man who puts the need to be needed above his own need to need someone else.The cast were all great in the roles, although about three quarters of the way through the film I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Gage and Pierce were both in love with Clarke. Frankly I was hoping they'd hook up. I found the character of Clarke to be annoying and self-obsessed.Finding Mr Wright is a good movie that is an easy way to spend a couple of hours of an afternoon watching. The supporting characters, rather than main love story were what held my attention. For me this film was all about the star turn of Rebekah Kochan and I really hope to see her in many more films.If you're looking for a light, fun, romantic comedy you couldn't really go past Finding Mr Wright."
3,Good movie,"This was a cute movie. I have see better gay themed movies, but I liked it and would watch it again...."
3,Moderately entertaining,"There is bettery gay oriented entertainment out there, but it is often hard to find. This one is middle of the road."
1,Terrible,"This movie was poorly written, acted, filmed, set, and cast. It was more boring than watching paint dry and with less redeeming value."
2,Don't even remember the movie,I watch and love many gay themed movies. Amazon keeps asking me to provide a review of this movie but I Don't even remember the movie. I'm sure I watched it but don't remember. I read the reviews and they don't have a trailer and none sparked anything of me watching the movie... I think that says a lot.
3,Spout is too thick for most mowers,"Great idea, but the spout is too thick and short for most mowers, making it useless. Its narrower black extension spout is also too short and doesn't support the funnel when extended, and thus it falls out of the tank. And, of course, it doesn't really work with side-loaded tanks. Still, a clever idea, but make sure to measure your tank's opening before dropping the cash for it. Hope version 2.0 fixes these problems."
5,A journey from despair to acceptance,"Pettersson's music has a very distinctive sound and can hardly be confused with that of any other composer. After the rapid onset of crippling polyarthritis in his early forties, he spent the remaining 27 years of his life in near-constant physical pain.The Seventh Symphony is the most well known and frequently performed of all of his symphonies and dedicated to Antal Dorati. As usual immaculate sound quality from BIS. Highly recommended.You can download the sheet music (PDF) of Pettersson's Symphony No. 7 here:[...]I also recommend you hear the composer Kurt Atterberg who was a compatriot/contemporary of Pettersson."
2,THIS IS CRAZY!!!,"ON THE BOX IT SHOW A PICTURE OF TOENAILS THAT ARE BROWN AND UGLY THAT CLEARS UP IN THE LAST PICTURE. I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES OF THE TOENAILS, WHEN I READ THE DIRECTIONS ON THE BACK OF THE BOTTLE IT SAID THAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EFFECTIVE ON FINGERNAILS AND TOENAILS. I WAS LIKE WHAT IN THE WORLD!!! WHY HAVE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES OF TOENAILS AND IT'S NOT USED FOR TOENAILS. THE BOTTLE STATES IT IS USED FOR RINGWORM AND ATHLETE'S FOOT. I DONT SEE WHAT THOSE 2 HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES OF NAILS. I GUESS THE ONLY GOOD THINGS IS THAT YOU GET 2 NAIL GRINDERS AND CLIPPER, WELL THATS NOT REALLY A GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THOSE FROM THE DOLLAR STORES. THEY SHOULD STATE ON THE BOX THAT IT IS NOT FOR NAILS OR NOT SHOW BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES OF NAILS ON THE BOX."
3,False Advertising,"I ordered this product twice. I have no complaint with the product, it was recommended by my doctor.On my first order I received the 33% more bottle. The second time I ordered two bottles. I received the two bottles but they were standard 1oz bottles, not the 33% more bottles. Beware. If they will no longer ship the larger bottles, they should change their ad."
2,Not Very Effective Product,"My toenails are infected and have greenish-yellowed, so I went to RiteAid and purchased the kit. The only reason I believed this would work because of the additional filers and nail clippers. Well, I was wrong. The nail clippers would bend the nail, but not throughly cut regardless how thin my nails were. The cream is light and watery, so it's not potent enough compared to Lamasil. Even though I followed the directions, washed my feet night and day w/ white vinegar, and applied this junk, there was very little results on the first stages of my fungal infection. The only ""improvement"" was two weeks and half later my nails turned yellow. Do not waste your valuable earnings on this junk. To be honest: only the xtra depth filers worked, hence the two stars rating.Don't buy!"
1,Received item not as described - nothing corrected by sender,"The Mycocide purchased from just.otc advertised the product as including a nail clipper. The box that I received had no nail clipper included. I emailed the seller about the problem. The seller did not ever respond to my email to date. For this ignoring of my inquiry, I give this seller the lowest rating."
4,fun quick game,this is a gift to my friend. the beauty of this game is the simplicity of the mech. - quick and fun game.
3,"Fun, but not re-playable","The game of St. Petersburg is great: It's fun, easy to play, and quick to learn. All around the game is entertaining, that is the first couple of times you play it.This game does not hold after a couple of rounds. I found it easily look over when compared to games like Catan, Dominion, or Agricola. It just does not have the set ability to make people want to keep playing it. I found myself playing to one set strategy and not really looking for more ways to win.The best part of the games is that it is played in about 30-40 minutes with four people, so if you do not have a lot of time, but wanna play a game, this one works.Pros:Easy to learnQuick to playAll around funCons:Not very re-playableNot very many ""winning"" strategiesMy recommendation is that you look into other card games first like Dominion, Munchkins, or Race for the Galaxy before trying this one, and if you really like card games this one is an okay addition to your roster."
4,Fun and challenging game that's missing a little something...,"The first time I played this game, I fell in love with it. It was a pretty simple concept. Buy workers to gain money, buildings to gain victory points, aristocrats to gain both, and upgrades to add value to what you've bought. Also, try to make sure you have a good diversity of aristocrats to maximize your end-game bonus. The challenge comes in doing it better and faster than your opponents. After many plays, however, there are strategies that are vastly superior to others, and better players will gravitate toward using them. As a 2-player game it's just OK, but with a full complement of 4 there's a bit more unpredictability so the game is much more interesting. I highly recommend getting the expansion, as it increases the scope of the game with some really cool cards. It also has rules and components for a fifth player."
5,Fun game!,"This game can take a while to explain and learn how to play, but it is very fun. i find that i play the game differently each time i play."
1,What? very very very BAD!,"At first these things WERE the most comfortable good fitting shoes I ever tried on. They looked good too, however they stunk like gross bandaids or farm hay. So I tried to overlook the smell & being a clean freak figured I could get the gross material smell out- WRONG! So they stunk but I still ran in them. I have a size 10 am not fat nor skinny, run 10-20 miles per week. These shoes felt great for 2 months then they wore out so quick!!!! I suffered nothing but leg and hip pain and went back to a beat up old pair of nike running shoes."
4,Minerals,I have investigated and completed many courses in regards to health issues. Minerals play a vital role in one's health.
5,Absolutely breathtaking,"Jack Bauer fans will love this season, which is as every bit as good as the wonderful Season One. As this day begins, Jack is working for the DOD and happily in love when, bang! There is a kidnapping, an assassination attempt, and a couple of nuclear threats. The terrorists are keeping Agent Bauer busy and we love it.This season of ""24"" brings back some great old friends (Tony, Michelle, and David Palmer) and introduces delightful new ones (Chloe, Edgar, and Bill Buchanan). There are twists and surprises at every turn and the body count is sky high; through it all, Jack keeps his cool and shows again that he can be vulnerable and still save humanity.Kiefer Sutherland continues to wow us with his energy, intensity, and charisma. Production values rival those on feature films with split screens, extravagant special effects, and gritty locations. Season Four is addictive and fun."
5,JC,"24 is awesome, as expected, since I have worked through the other 3 seasons. I enjoy the DVD experience since you can continue looking until you pass out from epinephrine overload. The experience is different from the weekly interlude of a TV show.I have one kudo for Amazon. The delivery did not occur as notification email had indicated. I contacted Amazon and they could not track the item down in shipment. Amazon immediatedly coordinated a second shipment that arrived as promised. Likely, some terroist intercepted the first set of DVD's and used them for training."
5,came quickly,The item was in very good condition it came very quickly and I am happy with the purchase through Amazon ..Great service.
3,24 seasons,If you have ever read Robert Ludlum and loved his books this is the video set for you. I prefer seasons one and three but all seasons will hold your interest and pump your adrenaline.All seasons revolve around Jack Bauer who is the super agent in the counter terrorist agency.
1,Apathetic Management,"Ordered Season 4, received Season 5. Movie Revolution didn't find this error particularly egregious--afterall 24 is 24, right. Slow, inept and uninterested in remedying their mistake. Avoid this company!"
3,Decent Transaction,"My order was not delivered in the allotted time, and the seller failed to recognize my first attempt at communication from Amazon. After my order was past the 3.5 week period, I emailed the seller directly from my account, and he responded accordingly. My order did arrive within the next week. It seemed to me that this seller forgot to send the order in the first place, but got it done in the end.I'd give the seller one more try."
2,Show most desparately in need of Tom Clancy as an advisor.,"This season was marred for me by the endless series of technical mistakes ending with the identification of what looked like a 1965 Hawk anti-aircraft missile as a modern ""stealth"" cruise missile. The unending legions of arab terrorists, popping up just when they could do the most damage, with no explanation of how they got their intelligence became a running joke.My mother's the fan of this show and for her sake I'll look for season five, I just hope its a lot better written."
5,"Yes Jack, yes!","If you liked Jack before you will love him now. With new characters, old charactes and even old friends cast in a new light, all of the elements that you expect from this top knotch thriller come together in perfect harmony to provide 24 hours of edge of your seat viewing."
5,Still the best ride on tv,Season 4 doesn't disappoint. This is still the best thrill ride on tv and the by now well talked about shock ending is still valid when you watch the set. Great stuff!
5,The Most Suspenseful Thriller on TV,"24 just keeps getting better and better, with over the top plot twists and cliff hangers just about every minute. Season four was a particular stand out because, almost alone on TV or film, 24 dared to actually have Middle Eastern terrorists as the bad guys. Imagine, that in the post 9/11 world."
3,A letdown (sort of),"For those like me that are late to the game and just discovered 24, I found Season 4 to be exciting but MUCH less believable that prior seasons. Without giving anything away, I can say the believability factor at least didn't plummet until Disk 6 (Episodes 21-24). A more realistic ending would have ranked this season right up there with the first three."
5,"Heart-stopping, pulse-pounding action","I'm another latecomer to 24. Watched the first episode of season one and wasn't sure I wanted to invest the time. Decided this summer to begin the DVD's so have been plowing through one season at a time. Wow. This is amazing TV and even better when watched on DVD with the clear picture and sharp sound - not to mention all the extras and lack of commercials. While I was mildly disappointed in season three with the 'all over the map' storylines, season four is absolutely excellent and the most enjoyable and exciting edition of 24 since season one. Highly recommend."
4,Getting a little more crazy,"I have watched the seasons sequentially and this one had a bit of a different feel to it. There was more than just one or two main challenges, so it seemed to put one more into the suspension of disbelief than the other seasons, if that is possible. Jack is once again 'the man that does it all.' And once again sacrafices love for his first love of adventure."
4,a very good one...,"it looks like Jack as still a lot of work ahead, back at CTU he's a BAUER more than ever.don't miss it"
3,Better than season 3,"Season 4 is well directed, and there are some episodes that I had to just pause and take a breather from because of the intensity. That said, I felt the writing was weaker than seasons 1 & 2, but stronger than season 3.The bad guys are the Islamofacists again, but we have no clue as to their motivation, except that they hate America for whatever reason. Maybe the villians next season will be college professors or liberal Democrats, because they hate America too.There are several new characters at CTU, the usual lineup of social cripples, moles and skilled field agents. William DeVane plays the secretary of defense, but he mysteriously disappears and returns for unexplained reasons. Jack's love interest is a wimpy, confused woman, a character I could have done without. Jack continues to offer presidential pardons to get the location of the bad guys.Season 4 does not suffer from the morally liberal and problematic themes of the previous season set."
3,Semi-satisfied,"One of the discs was missing from the set of six. I would expect that I would be sent the missing disc, but that was not the case. First, I was offer compensation of $5; but I requested the missing disc. Then, I was notified that I was being given a credit, for the full amount; but no missing disc. Now, 10 days after being told I was to get a full refund, it has not shown up in my bank account. That's why I'm Semi-satisfied."
4,I don't understand all the new characters,"I know this series is popular but I totally don't get it. My brother and sister watch it and I sit there not really knowing what's going on. I feel panicked because they talk about it like I should be able to follow it but all I can do is nod and say, ""that's interesting"" or ""how will Jack get out of this one."" It's frustrating. If anyone can help me, please let me know... where is Jack's ex-wife Kim? And why did they shoot the president? Is it because he's black? Because that's racist.Also I know that Keith Sutherland plays by his own rules and gets results but don't you think he should follow the rules a bit more often. Protocol is protocol and you need to follow it otherwise you go to jail. Also I don't think last night's episode was convincing where Jack discoverd a bomb in the hard drive of his computer. If there were bombs in the hard drive of computers then Microsoft would go bankrupt.Overrated, but still very good."
1,"""Mocha Moments"" Ugggh!","This book tries to extend to every woman. The characters are thin and predictable. The scenarios are boring. Even the name of the meeting place is ""Mocha Moments"" ugghhhh!. The women conveniently solve their major problems in a year and learn their lesson. If you are looking for light reading where you can multi-task and want something that is extremely easy to follow this it. I had a hard time finishing this book. This is the first rating below a 3 that I have on Amazon."
5,"Friendship - that's what it's all about, after all.",I cannot say enough good things about this story. I was enraptured by the unique way that the storyteller began each chapter - what a way to tell a story. The writer is very gifted. I would love to see this in movie form. I would also like to recommend The Color of Revenge by Millicent Hart. You'll love it.
2,Didnt' meet expectations,A friend of mine told me I had to read this. I got the book and eagerly started . . . I just couldn't get into it.
1,Wanted a book.,"I thought I ordered a book. NOT an audio book. I am sure it is a great book, wish I could read it."
5,Wish I could join their group,"Debbie Macomber can tell a story about issues concerning women like no other author. She can make you happy, sad, concerned all at the same time. She has an insight into women's lives."
5,Novel celebrating friendship,"This is a wonderful story of 4 women who meet in a journaling class and become very good friends. Each of them chooses a word that illustrates the situation they're in or how they view themselves. As I also see the benefits of keeping a journal and also understand how important and beneficial good friendships can be, I really enjoyed this book."
3,The Power of Female Frienship,"Debbie Macomber fills the pages of her book, Thursdays at Eight, with a delightful story of the power of female friendship.After meeting in a journaling class, Julia, Liz, Clare & Karen decide to further their friendship by meeting for breakfast each Thursday at Eight. In these Thursday morning meetings many laughs and heartaches are shared forming a tight bond between the women. Each character, unique and insightful, brings something new to the table for the others to relish in. As the four face trials in their lives they turn to each other for support and love.This book delivers an enjoyable read of how people's lives are shaped by the people whom they decide to call friends."
3,All parents should watch this with there kids!!!!!,"I first saw Deathof Richie in 1977 ,my mother made me stay up late to watch it .I had no idea what it was about boy did it blow me away. Very powerful movie. Some people might think it's dated for today standards. But the message is still the same 30 years later.Vin"
3,missing the ending,"This is not the sellers fault, but, I bought this for the movie ""The Death of Richie"" it arrived promptly, I was happy as I sat down to watch an old favorite movie. Much to my disappointment the last 5 to 10 minutes of the movie are missing. It totally leaves out the part as to ""how"" Richie died. It just jumps from on scene to the closing credits. This is based on a true story and to leave off the ending is just soooo wrong."
5,Death Of Richie,this dvd is very serious and sad it about a teenager who get involed with druges and then later fines out that it is just a waste of life for him when reality kick in then it is too later too save himself or the parents can't I will neve forget about this movie for as long as I live it ia a must but for someone who does not no what they are getting into.
3,Awesome design but...,"I got this product because my brother has one (160 GB). I loved that his was portable and looked cool. Unfortunately I was not able to find the 160 GB so I went with this one(320 GB). I love the design but you have to have it plugged into a power supply which doesn't make it portable and it's a little big to lug around. This is a good product if it's just sitting on a desk for a desktop computer but if you want something to work through the USB and is portable, say for your laptop, then I would try to find the 160 GB."
5,Great Whole Food Source of Selenium,Whole food vitamins are the way to go. They are so much better absorbed (and recognized) in the body than synthetic vitamins. I love that New Chapter uses a probiotic medium in their supplements. I will definitely purchase this again. Best price is on Amazon
1,Horrible heartburn and intestinal distress,"This exact vitamin (purchased at our local store) just gave both of us terrible acid reflux, heart burn and intestinal trouble. Do not take these unless you have an iron stomach.I wouldn't have bought them except they were the only vitamin E our small shop had. I really didn't want all that other crap in my vitamin E, just the vitamin. These things have a bunch of random stuff in it. Who even know which of the random things even set us off.Ugh."
3,Overall good,This video is pretty decent but don't let the title fool you. I don't consider this a beginner video. It is kind of general yet helpful. If you are truly a beginner than this might not make good sense.
5,love this show,good for fillers been waiting on them for ages can't wait till there are more soon onepiece rules !!! .
3,Full of Filler,"This is mostly filler, there are some good episodes here. The last two are main story episodes. It's not bad, but in anime's like his, you get use to it."
