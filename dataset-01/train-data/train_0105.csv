5,BEST BOOK EVER,"If your a fan of murder/drama/real life then this is the book for you. I have read it many, many times. It was exactly what the seller said it was, fast shipping, great price. Highly recommend not just the book, but the seller as well."
3,"Interesting subject, average read","A good read for those interested in Ted Bundy, although I found there was a lot of re-cap and overlap which made it hard to stay focused at times."
2,"Ann Rule - Not ""Beside Ted""","I did not enjoy this book - I felt that Ms. Rule WAS in love with Ted Bundy and the fact that he wanted everyone but her, scorned her in the end. She ""had"" a poor writing style there are extreme inconsistancies in her grammar - and she rambled for pages and pages about uninteresting topics and people related to law enforcement. I did not find her book insightful at all and do not recommend it."
2,Too Much Bundy,"too much about ted bundy, not enough about the victims. countless books have been written about this bundy parasite and nothing written about the victims except their death. ann seems to be honering bundy for some stupid reason. she almost tries to make excuses for him"
3,"Interesting, but a little off.",Okay read. Sometimes rambled a bit in the foreward and conclusion. The storytelling was good; the facts clear. The book got off a bit when the author tried to justify her personal position in the Bundy case.
4,"THE Definative ""True Crime"" Book","For the first several chapters, I struggled through this book. The writing really put me off; even to the point where I almost put it down. It seemed like it was a good book by an untalented writer, if that makes sense. I stuck with it, however, and was soon very glad I did.The book is surprisingly unbiased; Ann balances emotion and fact very, very well. I've read many true crime books, and most of them are either overly-sensational or insulting to the reader's intelligence. This book is neither.This book is the complete story of Ted Bundy that no other author could have written. Knowing Ted gave her the insight to write the book with compassion and empathy. It is the most touching true crime book I've ever read. In fact, it really doesn't belong in the tired genre of ""true crime"". It's right up there with Capote's ""In Cold Blood"", as far as I'm concerned. Highly, highly recommended."
3,Disappointed,"As having an interest in true crime novels, I thought that this woull provide an insite not often seen of serial killers - the viewpoint of someone who knew the killer.This book seemed to drag on and on of how the author could not believe that the Ted she knew would do the thing he had been accused of. Even his escapes from jail were given reasons for being normal.While it was a well written book, there was just too much sympathy for the accused, making it a rather biased book.It was worth reading, but don't look to this book to give any insight into why the accused acted in the manner he did."
1,Bedazzled by Bundy.,"The author's relationship with Bundy makes the book riveting; it's also its great shortcoming, as we are introduced to Bundy the charming scoundrel, rather than Bundy the monster. Ann Rule states that she would have gone for Bundy herself if she had been younger, or chosen him for her daughter if she had been older. Rule waxes eloquent about Bundy's attributes; he is brilliant, charming, handsome, dazzling, a prince among men, a star in the Republican firmament. Could such a beautiful man be all that bad, really? She was enthralled by him, and it certainly shows. It's a sad fact that we are seduced by outward appearances and charisma, rather than discerning the true character inside. Bundy was foul to the marrow, but he had a smile to die for. And many women did just that."
5,"My Second Reading, Better than the First","I read this book years ago and just reread it while on vacation. I enjoyed it so much more than the first time, although I loved it then. It really is a true crime classic, and as an avid TC reader, this one has my vote for all time favorite, right behind ""In Cold Blood,"" and ""Blood and Money."" If you've read it before, read it again. This one stands the test of time!"
2,boring...,"This is partly my fault because I was wanting a book more about Ted Bundy but instead got a book about the author and her feelings about him which I could care less about. Also, she seems to regard her relationship with Ted Bundy much more highly than it actually looks like it was. She think somehow that if she had the chance to talk to Bundy before the trial that he would have confessed to her. Please. Who is she kidding? And sending him money and worrying about him all after she found out that he was THE PRIME SUSPECT in these murders/rape is really weird. She thinks that she's different from those other women who were in love with Ted Bundy but she's just one of them herself."
5,good,"Interesting book, with an EXTREMELY unique perspective. That the author was the killer's friend before she knew he was at all connected to the murders, is the books main strenght...but also a weakness, in that it's hard to sympathize with her feelings that Ted should not be executed. The guy was a monster. But that is interesting, too, that her feelings of affection for him should remain. A very interesting, very readable book."
2,It Could Have Been Better!,"While the author does include many interesting and well-documented UFO experiences, his research was far too sloppy. A case in point is a reference to a well-known fraud and author of occult books who poses as a Tibetan lama. Apparently, Mr. Marrs was too busy to uncover this fact while writing his tome. Lapses of this kind weaken his claim to legitimacy in the UFO field."
1,Very bad programs. Stay away. Buy the book instead.,"This is a disk with programs from the book Numerical Recipes. There are no comments in the code, help file is just an index of routines without any explanations. Routines are translations of Fortran code into C but authors did not make any effort to conform to standard C conventions. All the arrays start at 1 instead of 0 which makes the code useless the way it is written - user must modify it. No const attribute is ever used. And this is plain C so if you write a C++ code and hope for seeing exceptions or references, forget it. You are better off buying a book and writing routines you need based on the published code. It is really a shame that such a thing is sold (and tremendously overpriced). jstrompf@soil.nl in his review obviously meant the book and not the CD-ROM, his positive review is misplaced."
2,Don't let the title fool you,"This book is nothing but a re-issue of The Portable Curmudgeon Redux with the title changed for some reason. Small print at the bottom of the front cover tells one this, but it is curiously not shown on the illustration at Amazon.com.I was suckered by this action ---- DON'T LET YOURSELF BE SIMILARLY FOOLED!"
3,For what it is worth,"I bought a 20pk of Lenmar 2000mAh batteries 18 months ago and I've used them moderately for that time and they still preform pretty well. These are not stellar batteries, I've thrown 3 or 4 out over the months b/c they wouldn't hold a charge properly. If these batteries were a little creeper they would be a good deal; as they are now, I suspect they are just a OK deal."
1,UGH,"I stopped buying VCA books after Black Cat, and sold all of my VCA books that came after the Logan series. The only reason I read the April Shadows was because my roommate had both books, and since it was free... why not?Even free, I still feel used and wasted. These two books are NOT VCA. Nowhere even close. April is not a good VCA name like Heaven, Dawn, or Ruby. The titles did not make sense. April wasn't a real heroine. There were no horrible, dark secrets (her father's secret was laughable) and no real family secrets at all. This book focused a lot her stumbling (and unrealistic) explorations of her own sexuality. And two books for this series? Come on...I'm waiting for V.C. Andrews to climb out of her grave and rip Neiderman a new one."
2,April Shadows,"I bought this book last month and sent it back because i found my missing book, but i still haven't gotten my refund back. They told me it would take up to 3 weeks, And still nothing. It got here on time, It was in great shape. But i wouldn't advise sending anything back, You may never see your money"
2,Virginia Andrews is dead.,"If you ignore the name on the cover and the fact that it's marketed as adult fiction instead of YA as it should be, this is a decent book. However, it does not have the darkness and disturbed nature that one expects from V.C. Andrews. April is a girl who finds herself in quite a few tragic and unpleasant situations, but not anything near the horror related in ""Flowers in the Attic"" or even more recent works like ""Melody."" Sadly, V.C. (or the ghost writer, rather) has completely lost her edge. It makes me sad."
3,April shadows,I have always loved these books however I feel this is not the best one I have read. It's ok.
5,April Shadows,I love any thing V C Andrews or her ghost writer writes. April Shadows has a five rateing by me.
4,"I agree, for the most part...","While I totally agree with 'Justice' that this book refreshing breaks many of the traditional 'VC Andrews' cliched formulas (that I, frankly, get tired of-I could tell you most of the stories without even reading the books!), you can still see some writing on the wall with the excerpt from the next book. Let's see, a jealous 'relative' who dropped off their kid for someone else to raise coming back and raising cain? A lecherous boyfriend of this 'relative' who I somehow suspect will have something sexual to do with April. Sound familiar?Sadly, the most interesting character, Peter Smoke, was delegated to another stereotyped 'bad boyfriend' role. Wouldn't it be nice if just once these boyfriends were nice, and DIDN'T die?Still, as you can see from my rating, it was one of the better VC Andrews books in quite a long time."
3,"Admirable, but...","First let me say, that I admire Mr. Neiderman for daring to be different.I admire him for NOT having that beautiful heroine, and I admire him for introducing homosexual relationships in a non-isolating way.However, I felt that the book itself was fairly boring. There were some interesting moments (Peter Smoke and Luke), but I felt that the book was not really going anywhere. I also thought that more chapters would be dedicated to April's father's storyline, as that was what the blurb talked about on the back.Personally, I enjoy the gothic, somewhat twisted stories better than this. I like the Andrews/Neiderman stories that have events that would never happen in real life. However, I thought that this was more of a ""drama"" than a ""gothic"" novel, and that I could find similar stories in the young adult section of the book store.In conclusion, Mr. Neiderman, I salute your efforts for trying something different, but I prefer the gothic novels with the beautiful heroine."
3,"To ""Flowers in the Attic Fan"" from montana:","So the gay relationship in this book is ""sick"" and should be spat upon . . . but all the rape and incest in the other books was perfectly acceptable and wholesome?"
3,Picture Book,This book is primarily handy for imagery more than for text. It is a nice addition to the library of someone interested in Buddhism and art history. It may be more suited to the specialist and not the casual reader.
4,VERY INTERESTING!,I FEEL THIS CD WILL INTEREST ANYONE SEEKING SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN HEAVY ROCK.THIS IS DIFFERENT!
4,"A ""Must Have!""","If you are a Jan & Dean fan, you really must have this CD. ""Take Linda Surfin"" for those who have never heard it, is a very interesting album. There are many styles of music within it. A little bit of surf music, folk music, doo-wop, and other cool stuff, all together on one great album. Of course, the classic hit ""Linda"" is included, which I think is an awesome record! ""Ride the Wild Surf"" is also a great album! In this album, Jan & Dean give us what they are known best for... The Surf Sound. All the songs are surf songs. ""Ride the Wild Surf"" and ""Sidewalk Surfin"" are the big hits from the album, but all the songs are great surf recordings!"
3,You know we're havin' fun.,"This CD features two Jan & Dean albums on one disc.Jan & Dean Take Linda Surfin' is a typical for the early-'60s album, featuring one hit, ""Linda"", surrounded by cover versions of other people's hits (for that matter, ""Linda"" is a cover version of a hit song from 1947). This album is most notable for featuring Jan & Dean's first surf recordings, which are cover versions of the Beach Boys' first two singles (Brian Wilson can be heard singing harmony on these songs). The other cover songs are mostly okay, but pretty forgettable.Ride the Wild Surf is from late in Jan & Dean's surf period. It features almost all original songs. Lots of fun songs about surfing and related subjects, including the hits ""Ride the Wild Surf"" and ""Sidewalk Surfin'"". This is one of Jan & Dean's best albums."
1,"iMic fair for the money, marginally useful","I use the iMic on my G4 Mac, for an extra headphone output. The fidelity is slightly lower than the G4's built-in audio but it's a quick switch from speakers to headphones during auditioning. The latency of the iMic is so long (>100mS) that even single channel recording is practically impossible if you attempt to monitor the signal while recording. For voice recording, it's probably a useful tool.As a laptop WinXP PC audio device, it's totally useless. The iMic makes sputtering, glitching noises continuously on my 1.6GHz P4 laptop. The response from iMic's tech service was that some laptops have noisy USB ports. I've sucessfully used several other USB audio devices without problems on the same computer. I've tried the iMic on my desktop computer with the same, noisy, results.I think this is probably an interesting device for Mac hobbiests, but it's useless for semi-pro audio use and totally useless for PC users."
1,Did not work with Dell Laptop,"I had high hopes for the imic, since my new dell laptop does not have a line-in input. However, the imic does not work with my dell laptop. The device is recognized properly, though after following all directions in the packaging and on the website, no sound came out of the imic."
2,Weak,"Not enough preamp to power a simple SM57 - This item is probably only good for doing phonograph, tape conversions. I was looking for a simple preamp for non-phantom power mics to do some quick voice overs instead of breaking out the real equipment. Oh well..."
4,A/B Demonstrator for Audio Demo,"I bought the iMic to use for live demonstrations to compare microphone performance. It works great for this because the stereo mic level input and USB power eliminate the need for a preamp and battery. The iMic saves valuable briefcase space, and allows for an easy to duplicate sales demo kit.Be careful not to set the sample rate in your software higher than iMic can support. The mic level / line level switch is explained in the manual but not labeled on the device. Toggle away from the mic icon for mic level."
1,It doesn't work on Vista,"I just bought this and it won't work on my machine. I searched the Griffin site and it said that the device doesn't work on Vista. Of course, neither the box nor any of the online advertising mentions this. I guess it sucks to be me."
3,"very inexpensive, but the product has issues",I ended up not needing it and threw it away. It crackles and pops at times.
4,"For the money, works great","For the occasional use I brought this, I think it is just fine. I am particularly pleased with the simplicity of use. Just plug it in and start using. I bought it in the first place to use in converting some LP records, but have used it more for listening to such things as Pandora."
1,not what I thot it was,"This product does not do what i wanted it to, so it doesn;t do me any good, I didn't know how to return it.Thanks Helen Newbanks"
1,Redundant - learn a little more about your PC's abilities and save the money,"It does do what it claims to do but, most of what you do with this item can be done w/o it. You can just run a 1/8 wire from you device(taperecorder etc.) to the line in of your PC. You may have to reset you sound device settings but that will only take a moment. Save your money."
1,Do you really need this product?,I have recently purchased this product expecting it to have many new features only to find out that everything it does can be achieved without it. Great for putting old records and casettes on CD but why not just buy a $5 y-adapter and plug it directly into your soundcard's input? I have returned this product as I felt I had been tricked into buying a product that I didn't need.
1,Shipping info is untruthful,"I'll tell you what I think. Your product page says it ships in 1 or 2 days, and now that I've ordered it, you say it won't ship for two weeks. I think you should update your product pages to reflect the truth."
5,Does what it needs to do.,"One of my systems had no standard 1.8"" sound input. What I needed to do was use my headphones, so I purchased an iMic. You plug it in, it works, nothing more nothing less, it just works. On MacOS X if you have a USB digital audio interface, the system will use this as the default sound output."
4,Good product despite deceptive verbiage on box,"I got the iMic as a higher-quality alternative to the cheap sound card on my XP laptop. For this purpose, it has worked great for me for the price. It has improved sound quality for both output (PC audio to stereo speakers) and input (I record voice from a cheap microphone for my work). To boot, since it's USB, I hooked it up to a USB 2.0 hub, so now I only need one wire to connect my laptop to all its peripherals.However, I agree with other reviewers that it's not quite a ""pro"" product -- it doesn't have the controls and connectors pro sound people are likely to want. And I also agree that the box's promise that it ""easily turns old records and tapes into mp3s or CDs"" is exaggeration. Of course, you need a sound card, such as the iMic, for that job, but in any circumstance creating those digital files will be a big labor.I'd recommend this if your basic goals don't go beyond just getting better sound."
3,Get the Ellington Version,"If you really want a jazz version of the Nutcracker Suite, get the Duke Ellington version which is available on the ""Three Suites"" CD. Nothing against the GMO rendition but the Ellington version just swings so much harder. It is a little short but in my opinion it is vastly superior."
5,Rock solid case.,"This case is built so well it will probably survive a nuclear holocaust. Durable, sturdy, lightweight, and very very safe. It is perfect for my needs."
2,Booooooooring,"The Newberry medal simply does not go to very many good books (with a few amazing exceptions, like ""Maniac Magee""), and I can't say that this breaks the rule at all. It's simply a dull, cliched story about a kid who has to learn how to survive on an island, and I almost fell asleep when I was forced to read it in elementary school. For the record, I actually like quite a few books assigned at school (unlike most people) but this one just left me completely cold."
1,Call It OK,"Call It Courage by Armstrong Sperry is about Mafatu, a cowardly boy who goes off to confront his fear of the sea and winds up on a dangerous island. This book has a good moral but too much foreshadowing. You can easily guess how things will work out. Also, what's with the cliffhanger at the end? Is Mafatu dead, unconscious, or just exhausted? Sperry just cuts it off and gives some background information. I'm just unimpressed by this book and I don't recommend it."
2,CALL IT COURAGE,"This book, which was first copyrighted in 1940, is still a good coming-of-age adventure, except for ONE BIG PROBLEM: racist imagery. The people the young South Seas islander hero must outwit and outrun in order to return to his homeland are terrifying ""blacks,"" ""savages,"" ""eaters-of-men."" This stereotyped characterization might have been acceptable to some in 1940, but society has since come to realize the harm it can cause to Black children's self-image and other children's attitudes toward Black people. To ethically introduce this book to a child requires either blacking out offending words (!) or prefacing and interspersing the reading with lessons in sociology and history, and even then, there's no assurance that damage won't be done. Why take the chance when there are so many other good books out there?Newberry-awarded books engender such trust. Isn't it time for the Newberry folks to reconsider their wisdom in granting this racist book a medal?"
2,Call It Courage,This book stunk.I thought this book was too short.I don't think many people like it because not even my teacher liked it.I gave this book two stars because it was really confusing.It was really short.It didn't explain things well enough to understand.I don't recommend this book.
1,It went on forever.,"This book seemed to go on and on. There was nothing in it you could relate to. You couldn't tell if the main character was in the stone age or if he was an Indian. The author made the story line very flat and un-entertaining. If you like books on survival, I might reccomend it, but it is nothing compared to books like _Hatchet_."
1,Call It Courage,Call it courage was one of the most boring books in the world. When i read it i could not consentrate on what was happeing. it almost made me fall asleep it was so boring. Some people liked it but not me! its a fast and easy book but its too boring! to me it just kept dragging on and on. If you like adventure you might like this book. I dont like books like this so thats probably why i didnt like it!
5,call it fantastic,"call it courage id the unforgettable story of a 15 year old boy named mufatu who is tired of getting made fun of because of his fear of the sea.so one day alone in his canoe with his dog,uri mafatu sails out to face his fear."
5,Mufatu - Stout Heart,"I think this was a good and exciting book about a 12 year - old boy trying to be brave. Ever since the sea drowned his mother he had been afraid of it which was not good since it surrounded the island he lived on, Hikerue, til one day he heard some other boys saying how afraid he was.So he set out to overcome his fears and to come back as a hero!!!"
4,Finding courage within oneself.,"This short book by Sperry (1897-1976) won the 1941 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. Mafatu, a Polynesian boy of 15 years old, has an intense fear of the ocean. At the age of three he was nearly killed when his mother drowned. Now he must conquer his fears. He goes off on his own and finds the courage within him. The story (probably for ages 9 to 13) starts off on the island of Hikueru in the Tuamotu Archipelago east of Tahiti at a time before European ships and missionaries had arrived. Apparently, Sperry, who had traveled throughout the South Pacific, based his story on an old and true Polynesian tale."
3,Call It Courage,The book I read was Call it Courage. It was written by Armstrong Sperry. My favorite part was when Mako and Alfa got stuck on the island. The part that was the worst to me was when Mako was made fun of. My favorite character was Mako. He was brave and had courage when he challenged the shark and got stuck on the island. The story took place on an island. I learned that if you are scared of something you should face your fear. I would recommend this book to a friend.
4,Call It Courage,This book is about a young boy named Mafatu that has lost his mother to a terrible sea accident. Ever since he has feared the sea. Due to this is is constantly being made fun of. While the other boys are out in their canoes he is helping make nets back on land. Mafatu decides to run away and face his fear. He takes his dog Uri and sets off to sea. He lands on an island and here learns what it takes to conquer the sea and has wonderful adventures that help build his courage. I enjoyed this book and it was very easy to read.
2,Call it Courage,This book starts out very slow and stays slow until he starts to adventure on an island. His dog Uri and bird Kivi are his only friends. He has a fight with a shark...One day he loses his knife in the ocean. He swims down to get it and is attacked...Then one night he...runs into cannibals. They chase him...He was scared of the water and he lived on an island!...SOME poeple may enjoy this but I DIDN'T!
2,Pass this book by,"This is a story about a boy named Mafatu from Polynesia. Mafatu is scared of the ocean. This is because his mother died in it when he was very young. Mafatu, son of the great cheif, was called the boy who was afraid, and while all of the other boys where out fishiing, Mafatu stayed on the island and made them tools. Mafatu's only freinds where his dog and a bird. One day, to prove to every one that he could go in the ocean he went out on a canoe, but a storm came and he and his dog ended up on an island. This book is about this boy and his dog on the island and trying to get home. I did not like this book very much. It was not funny, and it didn't have much action. I also thought that the plot was pretty boring. It did have some good parts. This book would be good for you if you want to learn about the Polonesian native's culture. It shows their different jobs, what they wear, their type of trophys, and other tribes close by."
4,This was a wonderful book!,"This book was very intersting book. I felt bad for the boy! If I were in his village I wouldn't make fun of him because we are all scared of things, and he happend to be scared ocean! The book had many wierd and hard to understand words. It was kind of confusing, what's why I gave it 4 stars. I can't believe that he killed a whale single handidly, I could never do that! I'm glad my teacher gave me this book for summer reading! It was sogood! Caitlin"
3,"Enjoyable, just really predictable","Call it Courage is pretty good, but everything happened as I predicted. If you don't mind predictable books, you will like Call it Courage!"
1,The kid that wanted courage,"The kid that wanted courageThis is one of the slowest books I've ever read and having absolutely no plot whatsoever it moves along at a slow drawl. Although character development is fine and there is a good theme, the foreshadowing ruins all that so I knew what happened around every corner. If the author didn't use so much foreshadowing it would be an enjoyable book. After one of his best friends called him a coward he sets off on a journey for courage.During a storm his canoe is wrecked and he washes up on a mysterious island. For shelter he builds a hut of bamboo and in case he needs a quick get away he starts building another canoe. Being a 5-chapter book while three of these chapters the boy, Mufatu spends on the ocean with his dog Uri, I thought it was not worth reading. I do not recommend this book unless you like slow stories.A reviewer"
3,A Decent Young Adult Book!,"Armstrong Sperry's story of Mafatu, who is afraid of the ocean, does come alive with great and detailed descriptions about life in Polynesian islands which includes life, environment, and religion. The book is somewhat slow at times. The book is decent for young readers including struggling readers. Sperry's writing is clear and the story of Mafatu who tries to prove his courage despite his fear of the water. The book is satisfactory for me."
3,Call it Courage,"This book is about a boy named Mafatu. Ever since Mafatu's mother got killed in the sea Mafatu has been terrified of the sea. He thinks that the sea god, Moana, is out to get him and all of the people in his tribe make fun of his foolishness. Mafatu sets out on a journey to prove them wrong. This books takes you through the adventures that Mafatu has and shows what he learns and how he grows. This book is a fast and easy read. It is very predictable and I would recommend it to younger kids."
1,Call it boreing,i read this book and it was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boreing!i mean it sarts out ok but when he goes off on his own it gets just plain old dumb. it was so boreing!!!when i finished it i was so happy becaus ei had to read it for a class and i was finally finshed with it!
1,The Worst Book Ever Made,This book was the dumbest book I have read.It made me mad how poorly this book was made. ... I can't beleive the bird would follow him to the canibal island. This book was just a waste of time. ... I did not like the kid's name (Mafatu). The dogs name being(Uri) the dumbest name I ever read. ...
1,"if you didn't like Island of the Blue Dolphins, AVOID THIS!","This book was awful. In it, a boy named Mafatu runs away from his island home to prove he is brave. He lands on some island somewhere, and from then on it is a total yawn. However, it _is_ better than Island of the Blue Dolphins, though that isn't saying much."
3,"Don't let your own fear, keep you from finding your abilities","Call It Courage is a story about a young Polynesian boy named Mafatu, meaning, ""Stout Heart"". However, people call him a coward because of his fear of the Moana, or the ocean god. It killed his mother when he was yet a baby, and he happened to be with her, clinging for life.Now that he is grown up, it is time to grow up, and leave his fear of the ocean, and other things, behind. No one seems to believe in Mafuatu, except his dog, Uri, and albatross, Kivi. They are his true friends, and truly believe IN him.Throughout this book, Mafatu leaves his home island, to go across the sea to fight his fears. He overcomes many trials and really learns to stand up to his own doubts and the doubts of others. The young boy, after learning what it takes to become `fearless', and being able to live on his own, finally returns to his home island Hikueru."
4,Great,I love the fact that this book has so much action and adventure. I read it with my kids and they really enjoyed it.
3,The Boy Who Was Afraid,"Call it Courage, is the story of Mafatu, a young boy who lost his mother to sea and has ever since been afraid, then he gets sick and tired of the teasing, and runs a way, this book is about his adventures on the sea."
3,A Pretty Good Story,Call it Courage is about a boy learning courage. My favorite part took place when the boy Mafatu saw the people on shore waiting for him. It's a very happy ending. It's grand because Mafatu learned the sea wasn't a god and the people learned that he was great at hunting.
4,A book about survival,"This is a book about survival. The two other books about a young person finding for themselves and being independent from parents is ""Hatchet"" and ""Island Keeper""This books again is an island boy stuck on an island in the Pacific. This is how he survived and got off of the island by himself with no help from older parents, this book is a good example of all his internal thoughts."
5,Call It Courage by Armstrong Sperry,"I think almost everyone has felt, sometime in their life, that they would just like to get away form some difficult situation in life and prove that they have courage to conquer their fear. A very exciting book!"
3,gary gilmore movie,"it is alright , they are really dsyfunctional family . that is so sad about gary gilmore feels nothing about killing people . especially his younger brother not seem so closer to his older brother gary either . that is real sad ."
3,Depressing yet compelling,"This is about the murderer Gary Gilmore and primarily about the days before his execution. At times this film dragged and I liked the flashbacks the most. Where you got to know what made Gilmore the man he became. He had a violent childhood where his dad beat on him and his brother Frank but he got the worst of it. He was in and out of jail since he was 14.I don't like the death penalty. I think incarceration for life is enough and let God be the judge. I find it highly disturbing that someone like Dubya can execute people when he spent his first years of his life a spoiled brat then a drunk until 40. How can someone like that make decisions on who should live and who should die? It's beyond me.Anyway, I recommend Dead Man Walking over this if you want to view a movie on executions."
2,Christmas throught the years,"It has some of the songs I am looking for but I am looking for Jingle Bells, with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canidians. The alubm is from the fifties.I have the album but would like it on cd."
3,Necklace,"The only problem I had was that the picture is of the ""Sport"" necklace, but got the standard style. However, shipping was quick and the item arrived brand new."
1,Doesn't work,I wore this necklace several times and now realize that I wasted my money. I can't even tell the necklace even has any titanium ... there is no magnetic field. If you want true titanium (no clothe cover)and that does seem to work ... stay way from the 'cloth' covered ones since you can't verify what is underneath unless to disassemble to necklace. I would not recommend this to anyone.
3,"Looks neat, priced right but useless.",I admit it I knew better. Just because all the multi-millionaires playing baseball wear these certainly doesn't prove they have any medicinal value. However if you want to wear one to look cool this is a pretty good price. For us bigger folks this one comes larger than most.
4,Phiten Titanium Necklace,"I'v had this necklace for over a month now. I have had constant knee pain for 2 years . This product actually works. My knee pain is almost non existent. I also have a bad back. It has lessened that pain some what, but not totally . I would highly recommend this product."
3,wish design were sharper,Photo leads one to believe the design is much sharper than it actually turns out to be.
3,The item is good but...,"I ordered two 18"" but received a 18"" and a 22"", obviously I can't wear the 22"" one. I'm an international buyer so it's a bit expensive to return this item, however, I donated the 22"" one to a local charity sale. Since I can't wear this necklace myself I'm not sure if it works well, so this 3-star rating is given to the seller, for shipping a wrong item."
4,What I was hoping for...,"I purchased this necklace in hopes that some of my daily aches and pains would lessen; I am still a skeptic by heart, and hoping that all my aforementioned A&P;'s would completely be eradicated by the wearing of this necklace seems,well,silly.It is comfortable to wear (although I do wish I had chose the next size longer for appearance sake.) and not at all heavy.All in all, I would recommend buying this piece to anyone who wants to give it a chance. If I am able to do cartwheels in a few months, I'll report back to let you know."
3,Phiten Star Necklace,"Necklace is fine and it arrived on time and in good condition. It has helped me somewhat with the stiffness I have had in my neck. I will not say that it has gone completely, but I think it is helping me to get around better."
3,GIVES ME POWER,THIS NECKLACE GIVES ME POWER!!! No seriously it's just a blue necklace that I only bought because Josh Beckett wears them. GO SOX!
2,not what I expected,I have the wrist phiten and it works great. I expected tension relieve in my neck but got more from wearing this neck one. They might be fakes. Buyer beware and check things out.
1,Customer Service Sucks,"I have also seen many people wear these. I workout a lot. I decided to order two braclets and measured my wrist at 7 1/8 and order 7 1/2. I could not close the clasp. I sent them back only to have them returned!!! They told me it was custom- I order one black and one orange- how is that custom. I talked to two CS reps with the same answer- non-refundable!! They could have saved one customer by giving the correct size and sending back, instead they go to the expense of writing a letter and postage to send back the braclets.I have many people ask me about these in the gym- I can now tell them- DO NOT BUY, THE CS SUCKS. I guess I will find some kid in Middle School with skinny wrist and give it to them. I'm blown away."
3,Ummmmm...,I am not sure what I was expecting from this product...but pain relief from the short amount of time I've worn it has been unnoticed.
4,Helps me sleep better,"I wear it mostly at night, or if I will be very active (skiing, etc.). Seems to work for me!"
2,To big and it was faded,The necklace was way to big and it was not the hot pink that was shown in the picture it had a more faded look.
2,Not exactly as it appears,"We have several Phitens - all of which are in the blue or black family. My daughter wanted an orange one, since her team colors are orange and white. In the photo, this looks like it is truly orange - and bright! The reality is that it's not. It's a very dingy color, nearly brownish, and it almost looks as though it's gone through mud and then someone attempted to wash it. Suffice it to say, I bought it for her for xmas, and she hasn't worn it yet. I'm thinking it will stay on her bureau. It's too bad."
3,Glad to have a new one...but....,"The necklace was 16"" not 18"" but it fit (barely) so I kept it. I had an old one that I lost a while ago and once again I feel better when working out and seem to feel better between workouts....I just wish it was a bit longer."
1,magnetic necklace,"The necklace is unattractive and doesnt lay right on your neck. It's made of rope and magnets and the rope is too thick and twisted. I returned it asap.Phiten Star Necklace, Black, 22"""
3,"Doesn't work, but it looks good","In my opinion, this product doesn't work as advertised, but it looks good, so I really can't complain. I bought mine knowing that it most likely wasn't going to work, but I figured that if it did, it would be nice. It is simple looking, and can be tucked under any shirt. I wear mine everyday, and I have noticed no change. I would recommend this for someone who wants to try something new."
2,stupid,this is a piece of crap i ordered my about 2 weeks ago and the only good thing about it was that it came about 2 days early which was good but the necklace broke the second day i got it.
2,Looks good. Works like a pile of poo.,"Yeah, so I was suckered into buying this product after seeing Josh ""LIAR"" Beckett wearing this during one of his pitching outings. Lemme just say THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP!!! No way does this thing relieve anything. I think its all in your head because when I first bought it I too believed it was working. But now MY BACK HURTS!!!! LIARS!!!! ARGH!!!PS Josh Beckett is currently injured...On the other hand, it does look nifty so if youre just buying it for the look then go for it. If not, go to an asian massage parlor or something."
1,It works if you think it does!,"Come on, people! If these products really worked, everyone would wear them! The manufacturers want you to think they work, so they can sell them and make $$$. I have tried the phiten, and the balance bracelet, and magnetic therapy. I have noticed no change in my myriad aches, pains, and stiffnesses. I have worn a phiten necklace for over a month, just to give it a chance. If anything, I feel worse with it on, so I am giving up. Save your money!"
1,Nonsense,"This bracelet doesn't contain any ""ions"", ""technology"" nor ""energy"" which would noticeably affect the human body at all.Magic bracelets with different metals and magnets in them have been LONG PROVEN USELESS. Do you know who first debunked these things? *BENJAMIN* *FRANKLIN* did, two hundred years ago!He found out that it didn't matter whether he put metals or magnets or pieces of painted wood in them, people couldn't tell the difference. He told people they would increase strength, eliminate pain and cure all sorts of diseases with mysterious ""energies"". Of course it was nonsense but most people who bought them nevertheless claimed that they ""worked"".It's just a bracelet. No ions. No technology. No energy. No magic.Buy this bracelet only if you want to show the world that you don't have a clue."
1,Broke within a few weeks,"My necklace broke within a few weeks of purchase. (The bracelet I bought with it was too small. I wore it anyways, and it fell off within days and I lost it.)"
2,junk,After 2 days it broke. I contacted phiten and they told me since I didn't buy it from them I'm screwed. I was able to fix and improve it I like it. Just poor craftmanship
5,phiten titanium necklace,"very happy with product and seller, item arrived when promised and in excellent condition...been wearing necklace for over a week now and seem to help.all in all, i would recommend this product and seller"
5,Daily Relief,We wear these necklaces daily to aid with the wear & tear of daily work -- They help tremendously to ease any soreness and/or pain -- Highly recommend this product!!!
4,Works for my shoulder,"I've been wearing it for 3 weeks now. I have sciatic due to a herniated disc. I was hoping this will relieve pain. I guess it's not that powerful to wear it on the neck to get rid of the pain in my low back. I also got the bracelet which really works for my wrist, elbo and shoulder. Well, it's probably the combination of the necklace and bracelet that make them feel pretty much pain free. They are painful because I am a Programmer and work on the computer all day.I would say this product works. I may be buying the waist belt that is not sold here."
1,Nice necklace.,"I don't know who the hell thinks this works, but it doesn't. Nice necklace though. I haven't stopped wearing it just because I don't have any other necklace to wear."
1,Not happy... Whatsoever.,"Very, very, very dissatisfied with this order... NOT the correct size. NOT the item pictured. Not the item titled. Says 18"", but it came as 22"". I have a small neck... However, it shipped/arrived extremely quickly. ONLY good thing about ordering this item. I could have gotten pretty much the SAME EXACT item for $4.99 from another seller on Amazon. Stole $10 from me."
1,Atleast it looks cool!,"Well, I got what I ordered. Does it work for me? No. Besides wearing it as a fashion item this necklace serves no other purpose. If you are having pains in your body try stretching or heading to the gym. I promise that will work better than some gimmick."
5,Outstanding,"I bought these for my grandchildren. All the kids at their school has one or would like to get one. They are very nice and I would recommend this to all your children or grandchildren. My grandchildren only takes there's off to take a bath. They were at a Christmas get together and the kids there wanted to know how they could get one and my daughter-in-law called to find out so they could order some for their children.I think Amazon is great as I only have to wait a couple of days and I have my product I ordered, plus Amazon products you do not have shipping charges.Kay J., North Carolina"
1,Worst album ever,"This was the worst album I have ever heard. I thought this was going to sound at least a little bit like ""Land of Pure Imagination"". It was exactly the opposite. There was not one decent listenable track on this CD. If you like hearing Bob Dylan as a livestock auctioneer, maybe you will like this, but if you are looking for anything like Roger's album ""Land of Pure Imagination"" keep looking. I have never been so disappointed in a cd in all my life. This is horrible. The sound quality is also poor. I can't believe this is the same guy who did ""Pure Imagination"" . Also there is a lot of ""language"" - cuss words and such.This is by no means a commercial album - in case you are wondering. There is a decent amount of talking - what sounds like clips from college radio shows and clips from his phone answering machine."
4,Holding up well,I bought this for my husband. I like that it's a snap closure. He had a velco one previously that wore out.
4,This was the JAM back in 1980,"Strictly speaking, this isn't the first rap album as it has only 3 actual rap tunes on it. But in the summer of 1980 (a VERY good summer for R&B albums in general) this was the JAM! ""Sugarhill Groove"" (with an amazing drum break by the legendary Tito Puente) was perhaps the funkiest track the gang ever recorded. Highly underrated. ""Rapper's Reprise"" with the Sequence (including the young Angie Stone) is not so hot, but the slower tunes ""Passion Play,"" ""Bad News Don't Bother Me,"" and ""Here I Am"" in particular, show that the gang were not half bad as singers. Oh yeah, the version of ""Rapper's Delight"" included here is not the complete version. But overall, a very enjoyable and worthwhile purchase that (for the most part) still remains enjoyable two decades later."
1,"Hands down, the worst book I ever read","How many ways are there to hate this book? Let's get started.First, the characters are so feeble and unsympathetic I foundmyself not caring what happened to them. From hobosexual Karlto mediocre Mary, and oh yes, Dot. Dot is a not-so-gentlereminder that the characters in some novels should be spayedor neutered before they get a chance to randomly breed. Thereare 2 characters of interest (Russell and Fleur), but theycontribute about 3 pages to this monstrosity of a book.I had to read this monumental waste for a literature class. Inormally like to read, but this book nearly beat the readingbug right out of me. Even if I had not been required to readit, I might have finished it anyway in the expectation thatsomething interesting would (finally) happen. Bad news, folks:it never does. The same utter pointlessness continues right onthrough the last page.I don't want to keep you hanging by a thread here, so let me getright to the point: This book is awful."
4,"Earthy characters, darkly humorous.","From the beginning of the book you care about the characters and what will happen to them. The North Dakota landscape is vividly recreated and the writing is clear, concise, and gritty. My only real ""complaint"" is I felt unfulfilled by the ending...I kept saying, ""but what happened to Jude? He will never know about his family! Wait, it can't end yet.&quot"
5,Complex or as simple as you make it,"The beginning of this book takes off like a rocket. It's powerful and serves as one huge hook for the reader, who moves along with the characters as they develop into adults (and depending on the character, not very nice adults), sometimes skipping chunks of time. It's a character-driven story, but the psychological thread that run through the book give s simple narrative a lot of meat if you're paying attention. This was my first Erdrich book, and I'm about to start another, Plague of Doves. I hope it is just as good."
2,A disappointing read,"I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading. I was so disappointed in this novel. It did not meet my expectations. I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly. The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la ""Weekend at Bernie's."" Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one."
3,a bit of nothingness,"Mary and Karl are suddenly orphaned when their mother takes a ride in a small airplane at a show which flies off into the distance. With limited options they decide to go to their Aunt's in Argus. However as the train they arrived on begins to leave, Karl jumps on and disappears for 20 years. From there on it gets worse.There are a lot of selfish people in this book that kick the people that they need the most. I didn't relate to anyone or any of their motives, they all seemed like cardboard cut outs stuck in unfamiliar situations.I think this book was summed up when a fellow worker asked me what the book was about. I was up to page 300 of 340 pages and all l could reply was ""Nothing much."""
2,Determinedly bleak,"I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished ""Beet Queen"", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. ""Beet Queen"" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here."
1,Puh-leese!,"This book is typical of a lot of the nothingness that is passing as literature these days. The characters are flat and emotionless, with minimal dialogue. I think the author must have written a bunch of absurd plot twists on bits of paper and pulled them out of a jar as she was writing. A mother abandons her children by jumping on a stunt plane at a fair. Two orphans get off a train, the boy sticks his face in a bush, gets attacked by a dog, jumps back on the train and doesn't see his sister for 20 years. The sister wakes up with her hands glowing blue. A guy is having a conversation, the suddenly starts jumping on the bed, flips off and breaks his back. Readers that think the metaphors are deep and meaningful are simply afraid to admit that they just DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE! Why is it so hard to find a simple, entertaining bit of fiction these days!"
3,"Confusing, yet interesting","So many things happen to the characters (which are about twelve or so of them), it's hard to keep track and think back of who relates to whom. The beginning is exciting because so many things happen, but then near the end, it gets boring because so many outragous things are happening and they do not become believeable or shocking anymore (like Sita dying in her garden and Russell dying on the float in the parade). It becomes so depressing at the end how everyone is sick, dying, dependent or crazy. I do not understand the deep symbolism in this book and sometimes I couldn't even tell if something was really happening or the writer was trying to trick me.It's ok, nothing spectacular, interesting read."
4,Beet Queen is filled with deep symbolism,"I found this novel to be enjoyable to read, with unexpected events occuring around every corner. The dark humor fits in well with the story line and it keeps the reader motivated. While the ending appears to leave the reader hanging with respect to some characters, it really makes you think about what the reason for that is. Why don't we know what happens to Jude? Maybe it is because Jude is the only character in the novel who has his needs met -- all the other characters endure a life long struggle for one need or another. The author uses strong symbolism which can be cryptic, yet challenging. It's definitely worth the read."
3,good at bleakness,"This novel is a study in emptiness, maladjustment, and painful fate. With their twisted sexuality and homeliness, the characters are vivid and realistic. But I just couldn't resist saying, ""c'mon, let's grow a little, let's expand beyond the deck of cards you think you have."" Yes, Erdich is a talented writer who sees deeply. It is all just so hopeless, those traps that the characters build for themselves and accept. Serious art, yes, but sheesh! There is rarely a light moment in the whole book. ...."
2,Scattered bits of people's mostly empty lives,"Written from several viewpoints that don't always make sense (sometimes unknown narrator, sometimes first person and known narrator),this books jumps from one bit of a person's life to another, with little about each one.I kept reading it because I hoped to learn something about North Dakota, and I did, a little, but not much; and I kept hoping it would get more interesting and complete, but it didn't.It is sort of like a photo album with a few notes under the photos, but no real story,other than that most of the characters continue to make bad choices, even when they know they are doing it.There is a lot of anger, fear, disgust, loss,fatigue, cold, resentment, and very little love, comfort, humor, support, warmth, or respect; just another story about mostly meaningless lives with very little resolution.Disappointing, and makes me very glad to not live in that kind of community."
2,Disappointing,I purchased this book for $2 at a used bookstore. Initially I enjoyed the quirky characters but they all turned out to be such losers. There were also too many characters and the story did not flow so I stopped reading it about 2/3 of the way through. This book will not enter my collection. It will go into my bag for donations. Maybe someone else will enjoy it.The Beet Queen: A Novel (P.S.)
3,A book about nothing,"Of the series of dry, psychological books my aunt has lended me over the summer-The Beet Queen had to be my favorite so far of mine. I wish I could sum up these types of books better, where there are just people described through they're life-slightly off, outthere but more or less normal chacters. None really jump off the page or do anything out of this world. They're all dysfunctional. One thing I am sure...these kind of books are not my cup of tea. There was TOTALLY something missing with Karl...I had faith that this would be a good charcter...I was very wrong. Random events and people described in a book, whatever."
1,Not a laugh on the entire cd,"The only thing funny about this cd is the title. This was the most tedious, juvenile collection I've ever heard (it could happen). I can only surmise that the positive reviews given to this mess must have been planted. Good Lord, this is putrid. Mine is up for sale for a penny, if you want it. Sorry that it is so overpriced..."
5,Kim Phillips,"My vet suggested me getting this book (I have worked for him for 6 years) and I am glad I did! It has 4 different sections in it, ""Presenting Problems and Physical Findings"", ""Diagnostic-Laboratory Tests"", ""Diagnostics-Electrocardiography"", and ""Diseases and Clinical Syndromes"". Each section has detailed information on each finding, usually two pages per each problem, which covers the Basics (definition, signalment, causes and risk factors), Diagnosis, Treatment, Medications, Follow-up and a Miscellaneous. There is plenty of information in the Appendix section of the book as well. Including a Formulary, Conversion Tables and more! I would highly recommend it to vets, students and vet techs."
5,The most used book on my shelf,"Whenever I encounter a new disease, or need to refresh my memory about one I haven't seen lately, I reach for this book first. I find it to be concise, informative, and useful. While other medical texts make for good fireside or bedtime reading, this one cuts to the chase, and is useful in the midst of a busy veterinary schedule.I use this book as my ""nerd book"", jotting notes in the margins when I learn something new about a disease from reading journals. Overall I am quite impressed at how up-to-date and complete the information is vis-a-vis JAVMA, the Compendium for Continuing Education, etc. I also appreciate that this book comes out in new additions often enough to keep up with the rapid changes in veterinary medicine."
4,Good Reference,It's been a good reference so far and will definitely help with real cases when I'm finally out of school.
4,Good... except....,I needed this item ASAP and I received it on time which was excellent since I paid for fast shipping. The cover of the book though looked a little worn. The book was supposed to be new but looking at it I wasn't 100% sure. If I had time I probably would have returned it for another copy. Besides that I was satisfied with my purchase.
1,Bad photography,"I have never reviewed a book before but this one is so poor that I thought I should warn people. I bought this book to learn a little bit of black and white portrait lighting techniques and maybe some darkroom or other creative techniques however the images are awful. There are very few pictures in this book that are even in focus. I can tolerate soft focus but these are just bad. There was one image in the book that was o.k. and the photographer even said it was not planned, he just tripped the shutter as the subjects were playing around. The shots that he staged and set up are just terrible. I will stick with getting information and inspiration from ""Hollywood Portraits: Classic Shots and How to Take Them"" by Roger Hicks and Christopher Nisperos and also ""Fine Art Children's Photography: Techniques and Images in Black & White"" by Doris Carol Doyle. They both had better information and much better images."
3,Nice pictures to look at,"This is a book written for photographers who already have a good knowledge of studio lighting. There is not much instructional material here, but the work is very nice. There also is a good discussion of printing an darkroom techniques by a master printer."
1,Terrible,"This book does not really teach you anything, and the examples are bad. The pictures that have explanation are terrible, so why woyuld i want to take them? Do yourself a favor, buy another book. The best pictures are just presented, with no technical explanation. I am sure mr. derex is a good photographer, except this is not a good book."
5,Joseph Campbell unfiltered,"The Mythos series is one of the better Joseph Campbell DVDs I've watched. It's simply him presenting a lecture, but that's as it should be. And what a great lecturer he is. He manages to engage you as a viewer even though you're not in the room with him. He exudes a passion and joy for his subject. Campbell also presents his material in a methodical order, going from Western to Eastern traditions. This allows him to present his work - including controversial views - as he sees fit, not as some interviewer asks him.This series is ""hosted"" by Susan Sarandon, and while her comments aren't particularly informative or useful they're few and far between. 90-95% of each episode is Joseph Campbell with no other voices. I suspect Sarandon was thrown in because some marketing exec thought it would appeal to ""dumb Americans."""
1,"Slow as Molasses, in January!","Why is it taking so long to release these last two volumes of Campbell's Mythos(III and IV)? First it was ""available in 2009-10"". Now it keeps creeping up through 2011, into 2012. Good thing they aren't expecting a big upfront advance, like most authors. If they were in commercial tv or even independent video, they would be out of business. They seem to be taking more time to assure their financial positioning in the whole scheme of things--I recall Campbell's speaking of the Businessman's ethic, which rules our ""culture"". I'm tempted to write a synopsis of the whole series myself(a Skeleton Key?), in my spare time, as all of this material resides in textual form already, anyways. Get on the ball. I worked in tv production, and it doesn't take this long to put it in the can. This isn't rocket-science. Just do it, or get off the can!"
2,Trite,"I was initially excited to receive this book and complete another armchair adventure. However, I was deceived. This book was rather trite and cliche and I didn't even finish it. It was a typical ""we pronounced the words wrong and offended a lot of people"" type of travel essay. I want to learn about the ambiance of a place; not how another westerner embarrassed his/herself in a foreign country by not respecting the people, their culture or language."
4,Mallorca encore,If you enjoyed his first book you will enjoy this one too...I did. A good read about expat life on Mallorca. Well written and entertaining.
4,Easily entertained,"This is basically a silly sort of backstage comedy involving gangsters and showgirls, like something from Warner Brothers in the '30s, but with tackier costumes and bigger breasts. Goofy and fun, if you're not too demanding (I'm not).The term ""albures,"" as I understand it (my Spanish is not very good, admittedly), means something along the lines of 'the dozens' sort of crossed with the ""That's what she said"" sexual punning Steve Carrell's character does on 'The Office.' I'm sure if I actually understood the language better, I might actually get some of these jokes.But, mainly, I watched it for the truly bodacious Grace Renat, who looks like a brunette Loni Anderson, except with (believe it or not) even bigger boobs. (And yes, straight guys, she has a nude scene.)If you can find a copy, check it out!"
5,The Evolution Man Or How I Ate My Father,"I picked up this tidy little volume on the sale table at the local book store and have read it 3 times, I'm on the 4th time now! It's a clever look at evolution, adaptation, and prehistoric life through the eyes of a rather civilized just-out-of-the-trees family. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining, fun, read! The perfect vacation book!"
5,Pouquoi j'ai mangé mon père (Why I ate my father),"This book is very easy to read and intoduces anthropology to the layman in a witty and light-hearted way. It manages to combine a history lesson (albeit with a slight stretching of the truth!), a prehistoric love story, and some very funny situations. Additionally, there are underlying comments that add a cautionary note on the dangers of uncontrolled (and often uncontrollable) progress, which rings true even in the present day."
5,"A memorable, original, and very funny book.","Since losing my original copy (a battered, ""pre-loved"" paperback) in the 80s, I have been searching for another. Much of the detail has gone from my mind, but I have great memories of my father and I both wiping away tears of laughter when we talked about it!"
5,all-time-favorite book,"Maybe I am not a discriminating reader, but this book has kept me enthralled all four times I have read it. It is just a wonderfully written novel. The novel projects proper British family customs onto an evolving nuclear family from the pleistocene era. Artfully done. I collect used copies to give to good friends. That's how much I enjoy it."
4,Won't be a Hazard to your Heart,"This story surrounds a girl who becomes the property of a Lord, when she is lost in a dice game. This story has it all, an evil mother, a ""ghost""-ly father, and the requisite love story. This book will not disappoint, I guarantee it."
4,Gift,This was a gift for my husband. I asked him to rate it. It is one of his favorite Christmas gifts.
5,Great Barrington but not 100% complete,"I truly love this album and I play it as often as I can. However, dont think that it is 100% complete as no essential Barrington CD can be complete without Here I Come (Broader Than Broadway) which the album is actually named after but does not include. Nonetheless, still a great cd that could have taken the step up to superb with the inclusion of this one hit."
2,"Beautiful Illustrations, poor story.","I bought this book with the hopes of having a great bedtime story for my kids. I was greatly disappointed. While this book has some of the very best drawings of African American children I have ever seen. It has no story what-so-ever. I'm stunned at the fact that two women are listed under ""written by."" It took TWO people to write this? I'm in the wrong business!!! If you want a nice story to read to your kids - this book is not for you. But, if you are willing to create your own story based on magnificent illustrations - buy this book. My 2 stars are for the drawings alone. The wording gets a ZERO from me!"
5,A Great Tribute To A Great Man,"Being the granddaughter of Tim Holt, I know a lot about him. But for someone who doesn't, this is the best book to read and learn about him. My favorite part of the whole book are all the wonderful pictures! David Rothel is a great writer, and he did a wonderful job writing this book! If anyone has any questions that aren't answeredby the book, e-mail me. Thanks! Happy Reading!"
2,Lots of Discussion but Few Measures,"First, I have returned this book. I did not completely read it, but rather skimmed through and was disappointed with my findings. It is pitched at a comparatively elementary level, not the quantitative measures of benefit to a process engineer. In general the teaching presented, which appeared to be little, was inconsistent with the content implied by the title."
2,"Attractive,but do not wear well","I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a ""run"" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-("
3,It's fine,THE WRITER'S WAY is an acceptable (if not particularly well-organized) basic resource for writing skill development.
3,not what I was looking for,I was actually hoping this was the single 45 version of the song that was released in 1969 but it wasn't. Eventually I did find what I was looking for but this CD had a song on it that I had never heard before and liked. It all worked out in the end.
1,Is this series syndrome?,"I've enjoyed many of the Faith Fairchild mysteries. The unreality isn't a problem in a cozy--so First Parish lets the Rev. Fairchild (apparently) spend summer in Maine. But this one--I couldn't even read it. I don't buy a cozy for scenes of abuse and torture. Then, as someone mentions, she is terribly jealous of one of his graduate students, but doesn't mind sneaking out with an old boy friend. Incidentally, wouldn't a clergyman's daughter have some qualms about a brief affair?I think they went to Cambridge because the author was short of ideas."
5,The Aquarist's Bible for Livebearers,"All of the Aqualog books are excellent value, although they are not particularly cheap. They are full to the brim with first class colour photographs and to reproduce these in a book is an expensive process. Whether they are about the beautiful Livebearers, new strains of which are coming into the aquarist trade or in this case arguably the most beautiful freshwater tropical fish species, they are the most comprehensive identification books you can buy. They never become dated because as new fish become available to the aquarist trade the books are updated. There is plenty of literature on Livebearers but none better than this.Normally the books do not really deal with the basics of fish keeping, there are many and varied books that do that. They are in the main a fish identification encyclopaedia. But for those aquarists who are particularly interested in a single species or group of fish they are indispensable."
2,"million dollar blackjack, eudemonic pie retread","I agree that this book is a amateurish retread of other 'beat the house' books. Ken Uston's Million Dollar Blackjack from the early 1980's (20 years ago!) was a lot more interesting and certainly more original. I didn't see Uston mentioned once in the book, whic is odd, especially in the tehcnical appendix by the team leader. If you like these kind of stories, you might want to try and find the Eudemonic pie (Thomas Bass, The Eudemonic Pie (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1985)) which is out of print and is again supposedly a true story about some santa cruz students who built embedded wireless roulette prediction computers that they mounted in their shoes. This was back in the 1980s!For me the writing is heavy handed. Perfect for a hollywood screenplay, like Crichton. Lowest common denominator."
4,Those wacky kids!,"This is a breezy account of how a group of math geeks legally made off with hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit in a card counting operation that exploited team strategy and casino stereotypes.This is a good yarn for a plane trip or a dull afternoon, although the book could have been much better. Basically, one of the team members spilled his guts to the author and this book is that plus a few stray interviews. The writer manages only the tiniest of glimpses into how the casinos dealt with the teams. There is very little history of the team itself.I feel the author could have worked harder to set the scene and show more evidence of background research. It couldn't have hurt to hear from other voices in the casino universe, especially other blackjack players.Not exactly Bob Woodward level reporting, but there was enough color (amidst a fair amount of purple prose) and more than enough suspense to keep me turning the pages until 1 AM on a school night."
5,Awesome,I really liked this book because it was very immersive and I learned a lot about the world of card counting and the people who are involved in it
4,Reads like a spy novel,"This book is about an MIT graduate's adventures in a blackjack team where he learns how to count cards and win big bucks against the casinos.The first 70 or so pages cover Kevin's introduction to blackjack and the team concept, and his training. After that the book really takes off and describes highlights of his experiences over the next 4 years. It covers the good times and bad, the play, the parties, the barrings, the team discord, and the danger.Alot of the book strongly reminded me of Ken Uston's adventures back in the late 70's and early 80's. This book implies the team concept was new to them, but it's all been done before.If you have bought other blackjack books and are interested in blackjack, you will definitely enjoy Kevin's adventures. Be warned, this book does not cover anything about how to count cards and does not introduce any systems."
3,Interesting but drawn out,The story written about in this book could have probably been told in a magazine article. I felt like it was a basic story but stretched out to make it into a whole novel. It is a good story but gets bogged down with superfluous facts.
5,Couln't put it down!,"This is a terrific book and was a lot of fun to read. The strategies and tactics these kids used were really amazing. Presents a truly unique perspective on the game of blackjack and the casino industry. If you are either a blackjack fan or a stats geek, you'll find this book extremely entertaining... if you're both (like me) you'll absolutely love it."
3,"Good reading but not quite the ""real McCoy""","Good, interesting story and well-written. In fact, Ben Mezrich is an excellent writer. While I have no doubts that the basic premise is ""authentic"", as a long-time professional gambler (card-counter, poker player, and sports bettor), I suspect that the author has used quite a bit of poetic license.As a related and interesting sidenote, a great companion book, also offered by Amazon[.com], is Kevin Blackwood's ""The Counter"". It is a fascinating fictional account of a professional blackjack player, and is highly authentic!"
5,great book,"Seeing the previews of the movie made me remember how great of a book this was. It's a great story with a surprising amount of suspense and action, that will have you reading nonstop. It also shows just how difficult it was to do what they did, which makes it even more impressive"
3,Go try it..,"Vegas must love books like this.The actual book is written in a disjointed forward-backward-forward style that left me a bit confused at times. I'm a Vegasvisitor, but not a blackjack player, but even at that, thegambling narratives were interesting.I would have liked to find out more about the actual characters.As it is, they are simply the trees around which the authortries to describe a forest."
4,Plays almost like a movie...,"I have been reading this for a while, and it really hits the style of Vegas -- the glitz, glamour and all sides of Vegas in vivid detail. The writing seems to show the personalities of all the characters and the dialogue and action seem to play almost like a suspense film would."
4,Who knew geeks could be so cool?,"My favorite measure of the goodness of a book is how late I stay up reading it. Bringing Down the House was difficult to put down. Mezrich captures the glitz and glamour of high-stakes gambling in Atlantic City and Las Vegas, and his descriptions of the technicalities of card counting are not lost on inexperienced gamblers.Perhaps the best audience for this book consists of math fans or technical-minded people, but the personality of the characters shines through in Mezrich's writing, making it captivating for any avid reader."
2,Big Fat Lie,"This is a quick read, but it has so many holes in it I don't see why the author didn't just call it fiction and keep his integrity.I have read some of his excuses for the obvious lies. (What sport a character cheered for ...) They are weak to irresponsible.How about, loosely based on a true story? very loosely!All this stuff about going through airports with tons of poker chips. Why?So, read it, just don't ""buy,"" it."
2,Disappointed to learn it is mostly fiction,"I picked this up after seeing the movie '21.' I knew the movie was largely fiction, and wanted to see what really happened.The book is a good read; the author can definitely write. However, I have learned that the book is at least 50% fiction! Look, anybody can make up a story. Just be up front about it. This book should not be in the non-fiction section. (Maybe it should be on the same shelf as that slimebag Fry's ""A Million Little Pieces"").I'm thinking about writing about my gambling escapades. I think I have a pretty good imagination, too."
3,"Easy to read, hard to believe","I have a hard time believing that the events that unfolded in this book are all entirely true. I think the author took some liberties for the sake of spicing up the tale. I don't know, but I'm not convinced that it was all true."
2,Fantastic story blemished by shoddy writing,"The story of the MIT blackjack club is an interesting one, but Mezrich bleeds the story dry with numerous editorial comments and useless prose."
2,Meh...,"I saw the movie and was intrigued. The movie wasn't great by any means, but it did just enough to inspire me to want to know the ""real story"". The first thing I noticed about the book, was it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The thing I remember about the book after having read it, is that it was too long.Frankly, I thought the book was too long and boring. There were parts that were interesting, and parts that kept me wanting to read more.... but ""just barely"". Most of the book was a chore to finish. I almost gave up a few times, figuring I've read enough. I did finish it, it wasn't horrible, but I'd rate it below average."
4,Perfect as a Flight Book,"What all the rest of the reviews say are true -- this is an exciting drama of a group of brain-power-overloaded MIT students taking on Las Vegas. What I will add is that this is a perfect flight book. A friend lent me a copy for my 10+ plane ride and this made the flight bearable. Personally, I'm not very versed in blackjack, let alone casinos. Regardless, I found the book enlightening, exciting, enjoyable, and even educational (in blackjack/gaming lingo). Overall, the value of this book is purely based on its entertainment factor; nothing more, nothing less."
3,Buyer Beware,"This book is somewhat fun and entertaing. However, I must say that I am not 100% sure it is all true, based soley on two things stated in the book that I know 100% for sure are NOT true. 1) NFL cheerleaders do NOT go on the road with the local team, and 2), the next time I see someone walk past a cocktail waitress in Vegas and snatch a drink off her w/o serious repurcussions will be the first time I see it. I realize these may be considered petty issues, but it immediately made me wonder how much of the balance is true. One would kind of like to believe in the whole story, but I'm not too confident in that. But if you can look past all this, it is a fun read - just don't bet the house it's true."
1,Bad fiction,"Mezrich is such a stupendously terrible writer, even if this stuff was true, you would never believe it the way he writes. His writing is lazy, unconsidered, and is absolutely RANK with the smell of embellishement and outright fabrication. There's simply no way to take writing this atrocious seriously; the fabrications and embellishments are so transparent, the mind boggles at how he got this sold as non-fiction.One last note: Mezrich never states that he changed names or places to protect anyone. According to the book, the protagonist was in the Weston, MA public school system until high school. I was in the Weston public school system at the same time; in fact, according to the chronology, Mr. Lewis was either in my class or the one below me. I have the yearbooks from Mr. Lewis' last years at Weston. He's not in any of them, not anywhere. If Mezrich changed his name, fair enough. If not, who on earth is this guy?"
3,"More Details, Less Atmosphere","Breezily written reportage: MIT students use mental calculations and crony canvassers to beat casinos at blackjack. *Bringing Down the House* is long on slick characterizations and predictable descriptions of Vegas high life but short on details that would give profound interest and authority. ""Kevin Lewis's"" 5 page afterword is worth as much as the first 250 pages; refinements of strategy are more newsworthy than the tightening grip of surveillance or thuggery of casino goons. The details of face recognition software tantalize; I would have gladly read more about how it works. One would like also to have seen fleshed out ubermensch ""Micky"" or, if Ben Mezrich had real moral insight, the psychology of the dramatis personae.A decent read while waiting for the dentist. Otherwise stick to Pascal."
4,Entertaining and educational,"I had no idea that for over 10 years members of the MIT's secret Black Jack club were going head to head with the casinos all over US. Ben Mezrich's book provides first hand account of how extraordinary mathematical abilities, team work, strategy and arrogance came together in one of the most outrageous plays against casinos. This is not the book that will teach you how to beat Black Jack (in fact, it will teach you not to buy the books on how to beat it), but you will be in for a great story about hard work, egos and double life."
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading this because it is such a fascinating story. What I got was just a fluffed up movie script without any character development. I don't even really care how much of it is fiction/nonfiction, but the book is just so shallow, it's sometimes hard to keep track of all the characters. At times there are names mentioned in passing, who are apparently part of the ""team"", but I have no idea who they are.""Kevin Lewis"" is a likable protagonist, but due to the lack of character development, I began to stop caring about him towards the end of the book. Part of the joy of reading books that are turned into movies is getting more insight in the people behind the characters. The deeper you dig into each individual person, the chances are an engrossing back story is there. The author just didn't bother to take the time to do this and it hurt the book."
3,A poorly written story of questionable veracity...,"but a quick, entertaining read nonetheless. As others have said, it could have been much better. I think the author must have written this book just to make money, rather than to explore what would be an interesting story without the distracting, obvious exagerations. I suspect some of the problem may have been the ""source"" the author had to work with. The guy comes off as a bit of a loser despite the attempt at a flattering portrayal.My 76 year old mother picked up this book after I left it at her house and even she noticed obvious contradictions and inconsistencies. But she also felt the book was entertaining despite its very pronounced shortcomings.I would like to point out that the book isn't *that* entertaining."
4,A great Look into a World Seldom Seen,"This book is a fascinating story that offers a look into the unusal world of card counting teams. And this card counting team is run out of MIT like an intramural activity.Well paced, well told story that makes for a hard to put down book."
3,overblown version of the truth,"As a member of an MIT blackjack syndicate in the early 80s, I can say this book gets a lot of the details right but massively overstates the success rate both in percentage terms and in absolute dollars. The previous poster touches on one significant point - if this crew had the edge claimed by the author their chance of going home down for the weekend was remote. Still, it has elements of truth and the fundamental principles of counting and variable betting strategy are well laid out. Check it out but don't use as your blueprint for instant success."
2,Balogney,"This is an incredible ego stroke for the author and his friends. The gaming action, the description of casino security and other anecdotal evidence points to a juvenile thriller in the making. The best part of the book is the description of the noodle heads getting the living crap kicked out of them by a couple of goons sent to the Caribean by the evil empire of casino owners. I've never wanted the ""hero"" to take a fall so badly in my life, and I love beating casinos for big wins. I'm just guessing, but somewhere between 10 and 50% of this book never happened, and the stuff that did happen is fairly boring. Don't doubt that card counting works, but do question how a tribe of skinny dweebs from a math college got past the Vegas casinos systems for so much cash. Pure drivel."
2,Hard to Believe,"Even with systemically perfect timing and play, I find it amazing that these groups never ran into serious losing streaks.Their simplified version of +/- counting is such that any attentive player, carefully varying his bets, could apply it even without an extensive team spotting in support.Enticing story, mediocre writing at best."
4,Why didn't I think of it?!,This is a GREAT book and the best I've read on how to make a fortune in Las Vegas since Beat the Dealer. The writing is excellent and kept me interested from the first page to the last. A phenomenal story to say the least. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was there were a couple of factual errors about Las Vegas.
5,CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE!,"Ben Mezrich knows how to tell a story. He takes us along with Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Black Jack team on casino assaults from Las Vegas to the Bahamas. We experience the life of high stakes gamblers... the fabulous hotel complementary rooms and the casinos' violent response to big talented winners. He briefly discusses the theory of card counting among team players early on, but saves the details for the last chapter. Ben also admits that the casinos have adapted by implementing continuous card shuffling machines. As a computer programmer with designs on lotteries, I felt a connection to fellow Boston area college students with a plan and the determination to follow through. I hope they make a movie out of this."
3,Making of a Hollywood hit,"This was a very interesting and fast-paced reading. However, it was short on substance at times. I wished the author would have painted a better picture of Kevin Lewis' interactions outside of Vegas' glitz and glamour; at the same time, I understand that this would have decelerated the momentum of the story.I can definitely see this turned into a screen play, with Hollywood sprinkling in more drama and action (just in case the average viewer does not find the concept of card-counting and fast-times with A-list celebrities interesting enough)."
5,"FANTASTIC, MESMERIZING STORY",Hi! I'm a teen and I absolutely LOVED this book. I recommended it to all of my friends. My older brother and his friends also really enjoyed this book. Fantastic!
2,"A Page Turner, and That's the Good News","After having read Mr. Mezrich's ""Burning Down the House"" I feel that I could go down to Atlantic City and make a killing at the blackjack tables. (Yes, I know, a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.) At the same time, I also do not feel that I learned very much about human character, or, for that matter, even the characters in this book. The story suggests that we are going to learn about ""six"" M.I.T. students, but it really only focuses on one - and, even that character, we truly do not get to know. I can't argue that this was not a fun story to read (though at times it became repetitive, even predictable), but it was also as disposable as a magazine article - and from a second-rung magazine (i.e. People, Sports Illustrated) at best. Enjoy."
4,You can be a card counter too...,"A good friend who doesn't read that much recommended this book to me -- he said he couldn't put it down. I'm afraid I couldn't either. Smart kids beating the house at blackjack seems like fiction...but this is non-fiction.And as it turns out, the book is about a lot more than how some card counting MIT grads beat Vegas...it's also a lot about how Vegas beats them and in the process helps the main character rise above the shallow riches of Vegas (or at least that's what he and Mezrich would have us believe).The story is certainly interesting, and becomes more than a mere re-telling with Mezrich's skillful construction, particularly his insertion of himself into the story in a way which makes you feel as though any one -- including you -- could be a card-counter for a day."
2,Disappointing as nonfiction,"Very disappointing given I was looking for facts and not a bestselling fictional account of a story that would have been very intriguing on its own. Even as fiction, the story jumps back and forth in time too much and is very disjointed."
4,"Not A ""How To"", But A Fun Read Nonetheless","Bringing Down The House is a book that most readers will find entertaining. While it's encumbered by some cheesy writing intended to generate more suspense than is inherent in the story, the book does provide an interesting account of a daring exploitation of blackjack's odds. This isn't a ""how-to"" book; but, it will give the reader an understanding that such an exploitation is possible and (potentially) lucrative. If one can't actually perform the feat described in the book, then reading Bringing Down The House is a more than adequate substitute for experiencing the highs and lows associated with being a high stakes ""card counter"" in Las Vegas."
5,Send me to Vegas now!,"I loved it, loved it, loved it! This book, while some parts seemed a bit exaggerated, was grrrreat! Even though it was a nonfiction book, parts of the ""story"" were so stressful, it could have been fiction! Ben M's a great writer and this was a great book! Send me to Vegas now; I'm ready to count those cards at the blackjack table! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,"Good story, badly told","While Mezrich certainly had the makings of a great story (which really would be a wonderfully engaging movie, if he's not involved), he's awfully impressed with himself as a writer. I thought the chapters scattered in the book that tied the author to the story were really egotistical, and added very very little to the story. And we learn so little about these MIT students as either students or people that the dichotomy of their lives isn't as engaging as it perhaps should be. A story like this is entertaining to read, which earned it a star, and is almost too good to be true, which earns it another star. But whatever interest you have in this subject matter will be hardly satisfied by this book.Wait for the movie, they'd be stupid not to make one."
4,Nice and EZ,"I read this book during la long fly from Chicago to Lima, Peru.Ben Mezich told us an interesting history of one of the MIT's blackjack team. The only problem is that most of the history is Kevin Lewis history one of the members of the team. One thing that I didn't like to much as the abuse of blackjack situation.In summary, this book is good reading in a plane.A great alternative to this book is ""the music of change"" by Paul Auster."
3,Interesting story but the writing slogs along,"I picked this book up at an airport right before I got on a plane for about 16 hours. I liked the premise of kids beating Vegas at its own game and that part of the book is quite compelling. You will like the kids in the book - smart, clever, resourceful and all that you would expect from a group of MIT students, drop outs, and grads. Unfotunately the author takes what seems like for-ev-er to get to the meat of the story. The last 20 - 30 pages of this book are really the good part but the pages leading up to that are slow with metaphors and similes that read too much like a college creative writing class for my liking. It was easy reading for a long plane ride and I was engaged enough to finish the book but had I not been stuck on that plane for all those hours, I'm not sure I would have stuck with it."
5,Bringing Up My Spirits,"One thing is for certain. Bringing Down The House is one of the best books that I have ever read in my life. I'm not much for reading a lot, and when I do, it has to be something that I enjoy. I could not put this book down and I read it in two days. And I'm really excited to here that it is going to be made into a film in a few years. Kevin Spacey and TriggerStreet Productions are rumored to be making it. It's gonna be great."
4,"Very easy, entertaining read","You don't have to be into gambling to appreciate this fun and easy to read book. Besides being a good story, it also sheds light onto the seedy side of Vegas and the intense greed that drives casino and gambler alike. Probably not a literary tour de force but sure was a lot of fun to read. I wish I hadn't finished it so quickly."
3,Really great addition for fans of true story,"I was surprised how enjoyable I found this story. (The writing seemed a bit rough for my tastes, which is the reason I subtracted a couple of stars). Someting about the David and Goliath nature of brainiac vs. Casino's just seened very appealing.One of the things I found surprising was how they were actually able to carry out this plan for as long as they did. Casinos as a rule tend to be fairly wise in keeping an eye on the trends of cheating. For a bunch of novices to go this far really gives it a 'rise of the little guy' feel. One of the questions the book raised for me was is it really cheating if you know the game backwards and forwards?A really good story (It would make a GREAT movie and I would be surprised if it's not made into one) that makes you think and entertains. It's an even better story if you have ever spent any time in a casino."
2,"Great story, poorly done","After reading an excerpt in Wired magazine, I excitedly ordered ""Bringing Down the House"". Overall, it's a great story: supergenius kids living a rockstar lifestyle in Vegas, but unfortunately Ben Mezrich (author) comes up short. This is his first attempt at non-fiction, and it shows. Some flashes of actual interviews and unfabricated dialogues appear throughout the work, but it left me disappointed in the end. This work should have let the facts, and the people behind them, speak for themselves, instead of relying on an unnecessary fiction-like framework."
4,Book review from grandson's perspective,"It was a easy read, interesting - I had seen the movie prior to reading this book and so I knew the story. Liked the development of the characters in the book better than the attempt in the movie, fast paced, very understandable.Good story."
5,Could not put it down!,"Loved this book! Way better than the movie '21'. Anybody would enjoy this plot regardless of age, sex, interests etc. Fast paced and easy to read. Great addition to any vacation!"
5,Fascinating Read!,"I read this book last year on summer vacation. I brought it to casually read on the beach through out the week, but instead read it all in one day. It was so riveting that I could not put it down.Once I read the book, I bought the movie - major disappointment. The movie was terrible and did not follow the book. They took certain liberties in the movie to make it more ""Hollywood"" but they just didn't have too (in the movie for instance, the main character's dad passed away, but in the book, he's alive and well and provides an interesting backdrop to the plot).Buy the book, skip the movie."
4,"Fun Book, but Scoblete and Uston are Better","This is a fun book and does read somewhat like fiction. When all was said and done, the MIT ""kids"" won about $25,000 a year each. That is fine but I wouldn't want to have to live on that income. It also shows to what disgusting levels casinos will stoop to stop people from using their brains at the tables. The actions of the American casino industry should really be scrutinized. However, I think the book is a little too exaggerated in its depiction of the ""lifestyle"" and typical nights of the team and their players. For a more balanced, and entertaining view, I believe you should read Frank Scoblete's ""Best Blackjack. I also heartily recommend Ken Uston's ""The Big Player."" Both of those books are written by players from the players perspective."
3,Blackjack Story,"I liked the story behind what these kids did. It was exciting and scandolous. I didn't like the actual people in the story. Most of them seem like overpriveleged brats who were looking for a free lunch. I was also a tad disappointed with how simple their methods really were. It had less to do with brainy algorithims and more to do with teamwork and deception. All in all though, an interesting book."
4,Dazzling,"Mr. Mezrich, in ""Bringing Down the House"", gives us a fascinating account of a group of MIT students who took ""card counting"" at the blackjack table to a whole new level. This fast paced page-turner takes a thrill ride that reads like a novel. Great read!!"
4,,"I would highly recommend this book. It tells the story of several mathematical geniuses, particularly one whom he calls Kevin, who dropped out of MIT to take up a life of beating casinos at the game of black jack.To me, what makes it great is that it acknowledges the mathematics and thinking behind card counting with clarity, but the story never becomes bogged down in ridiculous theorems and equations. All the methods that the students used are explained clearly and simply.Plus, it is exciting and overall fun to read."
3,geek squad,"Like others who spend a little too much time in Vegas, the main characters (& author) in this story try a bit too hard to be cool.Sometimes tedious prose can be overlooked for the excitement of the last few chapters when the suits send in the goon squad to freak out those smarty pants M.I.Ters and everything begins to go horribly wrong.If you want the vicarious thrill of a decadent Vegas setting or just want to know why the game has become increasingly stingy on the Strip w/the ""M.I.T. rules""-take a look. At least you'll know why you can't get in at a blackjack table mid-shoe anymore when the casino is packed."
2,Interesting story written at a 4th grade reading level.,"Did you ever notice how Hollywood loves to make awful movies from wonderful books? Well this book is an opportunity for Hollywood to return the favor.Bringing Down the House is a great story that is so poorly written that no one could possibly utter, ""I wish I had just read the book and not seen the movie."" The most remarkable element of the book is that the author attended Harvard. Henry James and George Eliot must be rolling over in their graves."
4,"Come on, baby, let's twist and stomp.","This CD features two Ventures' albums from 1962. Obviously, they were both released to cash in on the Twist fad of the time.'Twist With the Ventures' is a very good album that features exclusively uptempo numbers. ""Driving Guitars"", ""Road Runner"", ""Guitar Twist"" and ""Movin' and Groovin'"" are particularly excellent.'The Ventures Twist Party, Volume 2"" follows the same basic formula as the other Twist album. It's another very good album. Highlights this time include ""My Bonnie Lies"", ""Twisted"", ""The Twomp"" and ""Counterpoint"".Fans of the Ventures will enjoy this CD."
4,not quite as good as the glimmer sticks in my opinion,I like it but it doesnt glide on a easy as the glimmer sticks. I like the eggplant and the dark brown for my hazel (green and brown) eyes.
2,Pencil is an odd size and product breaks off,"The pencil is an odd diameter, and I had a hard time finding a sharpener to shrpen it. When sharpening, a lot of the product ""broke off"", so I was unable to use a lot of the product. I love the color, and I will buy again if it is available in a mechanical pencil."
2,Avoid this Marketplace Item,"I have purchased and enjoyed so many super budget Laserlight CDs, I find it somewhat difficult to pan one of their items. But this Dvorak 5 is a dud. Bad playing by a provincial orchestra, heavy handed interpretation and bad recorded sound. For this great symphony, look elsewhere."
4,Perfect for marking quilting templates,"If you are a quilter who uses templates, you know how important accuracy is to making all the pieces fit together as they should. I found that when I used plain templates, sometimes the quilt pieces wouldn't fit properly. I was using the quarter inch method - sewing a quarter inch from the edge. If the seam allowances were just a tiny bit off, then the quilt would never fit together properly. I started punching a little hole in the template wherever the seam ends. Then all you have to do is match the little dots on the two pieces you are sewing. You just sew from one point to the next. This little hole punch is perfect for marking these points on your quilting templates."
4,"Anatoly , St.Petersburg , RUSSIA",Very interesting edition for fans of statistics whom I also am. Would be glad to get the similar edition about superseries of clubs of NHL with the European clubs.
3,nice necklace,Nice necklace but the chain is thin and it isn't as substantial as the picture shows. Pretty gems and nice color.
3,Not my favotrite,"This is not my favorite of Beth Moore's. It seems really repetitive, like every chapter is really similar. I used it with a student I'm mentoring and I don't feel like either one of us got much out of it."
3,A bit repetitive,Beth Moore a Baptist Bible teacher urges Christians to examine their belief systems and develop an active faith as a lifestyle. She provides examples from scripture and her own life to show how faith in God can help close the gap between theology and reality and allow one to fulfill a successful Christian life.
4,Believing God,"While ""Believing God"" by Beth Moore may be more oriented towards women (since she leads a women's ministry), men can also benefit from the title.Among the topics covered include:1. Standing up to the devil in the power of the Holy Spirit.2. God does want His best for you.3. Principles of believing God (who He says you are, what you can do through Christ, God's Word is powerful, put God's Word in your mouth and spirit, etc.).4. We can trust God for all eternity.5. God still works miracles today.The narrative flows freely and is a smooth read.Whether a man or a woman, you can benefit from reading ""Believing God"".Recommended."
5,Powerful,"Anytime women get together to learn more about their Savior great things happen. This study was challenging, encouraging and powerful!! Loved it"
4,Challenging,I am enjoying and being very challenged by this book. It was recommended to me by a friend who did a DVD study with it.
2,dissapointed,"It was too much and dissapointing that we really couldn't do it without the DVD's and they are too expensive, so it turned out to be a waste of money."
2,boring,"Beth Moore should have read this and recorded it herslef! It was possibly the most boring thing I have ever tried to listen to.I was so excited and oh so disappointed. I will not buy any audio of hers again, unless it is in her voice! She is amazing but the reader did not come close to capturing her essence."
1,Audio CD Caveat for iPod users,"(...) this is not a review of the book nor its content; rather it is a commentary on a very inconvenient feature of the book on Audio CD. I thought would save the seven bucks and get the CDs instead of the MP3 (which is usually cheaper). What a mistake! I imported it to itunes and found to my great dismay that there is no digital labeling whatsoever, except ""track 01"", ""track 02"", etc. No author, not even a title for the book. And there are 99 tracks per disc!! I guess the publisher thought it would be more convenient for CD listeners to bookmark it at 45 second intervals, but not so for iPod!I don't know if the MP3 has a better labeling system, but my advice is to spring for the extra $7 and save a lot of time if you are going to put this on your iPod."
1,Disappointed!,"I ordered a Beth Moore Bible study workbook. I order three copies of the book from three different independent companies. All three books had the same rating. When the first two arrived, the books were in good condition with no writing in them. When I received the workbook from ""Books in Demand"" approximately 1/3 of the workbook was completed. The pages were filled in. This book is completely useless for our study. I am extremely disappointed in this company and their product."
1,Believing God by Beth Moore...RIP-OFF!,This is a piece of crap that makes no sense whatsoever in relation to the other materials included in the study. I threw it away!What a bunch of PSYCHO-BABBLE!What an EXPENSIVE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!
1,Disappointed a Video is required for this Study,"I bought two books for my husband and I to work on. I have done Beth Moore's study on the fruits of the spirit and loved it. I thought both of us would enjoy this study (even though these are ""women's"" bible studies). I got the workbooks and started working on the first lesson and was disappointed to discover you need to video series to do the study, a very expensive option if you are working on it individually or as a couple. You can stream the videos through the LifeWay website for $25 (this unpublished option is by far the cheapest one and I only found this out after calling the Beth Moore offices in Houston). But I don't recommend buying the book unless you are in a larger study. Unfortunately it seems the Beth Moore ministry has become video heavy and is very expensive for everyone except large wealthy churches."
5,for you who have lost hope...,"At a truly difficult time in my faith, a former bible teacher...beth moore's powerful annointing gives fresh insight when you think you know all there is to learn...but don't have the heart anymore to apply it! Praise Jesus for his forgiveness and mercy!"
4,Nice,The book is collection of 6 stories and all are good and a few are great. I especially liked the Lost face story ending and to build a fire.
1,Overpriced little gadget,"This little toy is a digital pet. You can brush his fur and feed it. It travels outside and in a digital house. Santa spent way too much on it. That said, my 7 year old daughter loves it. She was all excited when her monkey's friend called for a playdate. Anyway, don't expect too much from it. But if you have a little girl into LPS, she probably will be thrilled with it."
1,never got the Parfum OSE,"It is not possible to give a review,becose we never recieved the parfum.We are still waitting till we recieve the OSE parfumWhit best regardsJohn Niessen"
5,"Simple, straight forward... lots of miles on it.","This is a pretty simple unit, it's an elliptical with a pretty nice read out of anything you need to know. It's not an entertaining read out, per se, but it does rotate all the prime stats into a larger font. The batteries for the display last years and years! Simple mechanical tensioner, plenty of range. Ours it years old, I have used it probably 5 days a week when it's too cold to bike in Minneapolis. The belt just started to shred now but it looks simple to replace.Good unit."
1,Adapter does not work with Windows 98SE,"I bought this Lan adapter 6 months ago (from a different store) and could never get it to work. The device is actually manufactured by Realtec and their website lists all kinds of patches and other instructions to work around it's shortcomings. After hours and hours of fruitless efforts, I gave up and bought a Microsoft Lan adapter. It worked within 20 minutes! I cannot recommend this card if you are using Windows 98SE."
1,Artificial Flavor!,"Bought this tea only to find out that the third ingredient is Artificial Flavor, even though the front of the box has the word ""Natural"" on it and the packaging certainly gives the appearance of a natural product. I called Good Earth and spoke to the manager of consumer affairs to find out what chemical they were putting into the flaver. Guess what. That information is proprietary. Guess the artifical chemicals they are pumping into their tea are bad enough that they won't even relase that information to their consumers. Shame on you GoodEarth!Good Earth Original Caffeine Free, Tea Bags, 18-Count, Boxes (Pack of 6) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]"
5,The Best Hot Drink,"Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy Tea and Herb Blend, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)This sweet and spicy tea is full of flavor and a wonderful break from traditional hot tea! I highly recommend buying the pack of 6, because once you taste the bold flavor, you're going to be drinking lots of it!"
5,This is THE BEST TEA!,"This tea is very good. It has a spicy & sweet taste without any sugar! I cannot believe that it is available online at such a great price, too!"
5,Artificial flavor not a problem,"There are two versions of this tea. One is organic without the artificial flavor and the other is the original version. The artificial flavor is just artificial cinnamon which is what gives it that wonderful taste. The organic is bland but if you are bothered by the artificial flavor, buy that version."
1,Is this the same Good Earth that used to come in a beige box???,"The tea does not taste the same. After recognizing this, I compared its ingredients to the previous box design, and voila! the ingredients are not the same--this one contains artificial flavor. Not what I expected from this company..."
1,Much weaker blend than the original,"We have been drinking the Good Earth original tea for many years but this recent repackaging has changed the tea for the worse. We barely get one 8 oz. cup of tea with a bag and it is weak tea. Very disappointed with the new tea which is a far cry from the ""original"" and should not be labeled as it is."
1,What have they done??,"I've been using this tea for over a year. I don't know what happened but this last order of six boxes is just awful. Did Good Earth change the formula? Don't know but I will not be ordering this again. They have ruined a formally wonderful product!! So disappointed! However, after notifying Amazon my full purchase price was refunded. Now that is what I call great customer service! Thanks Amazon!"
1,"Used to be excellent, formula changed","This used to be my favorite tea, but the formula has changed. I've heard that if you can find the tea in the original pale yellow box, that it is still the old (good tasting) formula. Read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info (and notice the dates on the reviews, good and bad). It used to taste like a liquid fireball candy, now it tastes like hot water with black pepper.Update Aug 2012: I purchased this tea from another source (referenced in another Amazon review for this product) and although it did come in the newer purple packaging, the box says, 'with natural flavors,' whereas the one I ordered from Amazon says, 'with natural and artificial flavors.' The one without the artificial flavors has the excellent taste you're looking for."
1,"Changed Formula = Bland, sad replacement of original","With the new packaging came cheap flavor. I WAS a major fan and promoter of Good Earth Tea to my family and friends, drinking it once or twice daily. But, since Good Earth changed their product ""wrapper"", I can hardly stand the stuff. It has a bland and artificial flavor now, even though the package indicates all natural ingredients. Think twice before buying this! I would go back to drinking Good Earth in a second if they would return to the previous recipe, because I loved it!"
1,"Tea has changed, I am so sad!","I LOVE...LOVED this tea, I have been drinking it for so long I am not sure when I started....but it is not the same, I had a stash downstairs and recently ran out. At the grocery I noticed the packaging had changed but I didn't think much of it.The tea just doesn't taste the same. I read other reviews and I don't know if the sweetener is the cause but its not the same. It does appear they may be putting less tea in the bags or again they have changed something. My cup of tea is no longer a dark, aromatic cup of joy, it is light brownish and the flavor is a hue of its former self. I sadly had to add black tea to my cup just to make it worthwhile.I grudgingly broke out my last original tea bag and made it next to this ""new"" tea .... the difference is huge.If only I could get the original recipe, I'd make it at home!I wrote the company for what it is worth."
5,I'm not a tea drinker. But when I do drink it I like this tea,"I prefer coffee over tea most of the time. I've never been much of a tea drinker. I find myself drinking it only when I get sick or have a sore throat. But I saw the positive reviews on this tea so I had to try it. I think it's pretty good. Definitely better than any other teas I've tried. It has a spicy kick to it. It kind of reminds me of a liquid version of fireballs - a penny candy I used to get as a kid. There's a bunch of interesting ingredients in this tea such as papaya, ginger root, anise seed, lemongrass just to name a few. But the cinnamon stands out the most. I'm now drinking tea a little more than I used to thanks to this."
1,Artificial Flavor,"The purple box Good Earth Tea does NOT ""have the same great taste"" as the old beige box tea. It tastes different and not in a good way.The purple box tea is NOT 100% natural. It has ""artificial flavor"".Update: - Good Earth DOES make purple box tea with natural flavors. The 25 count boxes are the ones to look for. If you want natural flavors, bee careful and check the box!"
1,Not 100% natural,"This variety of Good Earth tea bags has artificial flavors, which is specified in the ingredients list, even though the description says this is 100% natural. I just learned that this variety has the same item number as one available last year on which the ingredients listing included only ""natural flavors,"" not artificial ones. Very confusing."
1,Now Artificial (Purple box),This has been my favorite tea for several years. The purple boxes list artificial flavoring instead of natural as the third ingredient. It now tastes like I remember kool aid tasting as a kid. Amazon customer service was great in refunding.
2,Officially out of love,"One of the little joys in my day used to be opening up a pack of good earth tea, reading the little daily quote (which was almost always different with every tea bag!), and enjoying the really good, all-natural brew. Now the brew is no longer all-natural (my box has 'artificial flavor' listed second), and after my first batch of purple boxes significantly reduced the number of quippy daily quotes (there were about 5 in rotation), now it's just a sad little white paper hanging off the end of the string. I'm officially out of love with this tea. Which is too bad, as I used to be a fairly good word-of-mouth salesperson for this tea. You've lost my business, Tata."
1,You won't get what you think you're buying...!,"I can only repeat what others have written: ordering this product you'll get the dark purple colored one saying ""same product, different packaging"" that is not true: instead of natural flavor this one has artificial flavors added. That is exactly why I wouldn't buy it, I was sooo angry when I got it, will send it back.Update: got a refund from Amazon, they're great. Hope the product description will be changed too."
2,Disappointing batch,"I've been drinking 2-3 cups of this wonderful, spicy tea for the last 6 months and absolutely can not live without it! However, the last batch I received (an Amazon order) is almost undrinkable--it's as if there's a missing ingredient and the tea is very bitter--not sweet and spicy. I would love to return all of it (6 boxes) and start over, but I'm not sure how to do that."
1,I feel like I lost a good old friend...,"Just another example,Of some conglomerateGoing & buyingA good ol' companyWith a darn good productWith a success...that is time proven.Only to ruin it with a shiny new packagingAt the very expense of the soul of it.This new recipe with artificial flavour does not taste even close to the original and natural goodness from nature.They seem to have changed the recipe for some extra profit at the expense of making it no longer a completely 'natural' product andmaking it taste different, and worse, in my opinion.I will no longer be purchasing this 'stuff' with artificial flavour..."
2,quality is variable but generally poor,"I've enjoyed drinking Good Earth Tea for the past 10 yrs, way back when it appeared in a cream colored box. Liked it so much I decided to subscribe for regular delivery since often I would need a few boxes and my local store was out of stock. Several companies, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods told me they had quit stocking because of variability of quality and poor customer comments - I should've paid attention. I have cancelled my subscription - in the past 3 shipments, there have been so few good bags I can count them on one hand. The rest well, frankly taste like crap. My strongest recommendation to people thinking to buy - DON'T - it's a waste of your money and after reading some of the previous reviews, who knows what is being included in what was once a great product. NO NO NO NO NO - DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!"
1,No longer a great tea.,"I used to love this tea, but something has gone wrong with their quality control since a change of ownership. The tea has gone bad. Don't buy it. It tastes awful now. I mean really really really awful."
1,Please bring back the original flavor!,"I have been a Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy tea drinker for a long time. Heck, I used to frequent the Good Earth restaurant in Pasadena, California back in the day wearing my Birkenstocks and flowing tie dye skirts. Good food, good tea, good service. But I digress. The flavor has changed because the ingredients have been changed. LIke other reviewers, I compared ingredients and found: artifical flavor (instead of natural), papaya leaves (instead of papaya), rooibos (instead of red rooibos), panax ginseng leaves (instead of panax ginseng). The tea Good Earth is now selling is flavorless and flat. I noticed it right away from the very 1st cup. My husband, who adores cinammon, also noticed a significant change in flavor. I'm really disappointed that someone somewhere may a bad business decision and messed up what was a perfectly wonderful and tasty product."
1,"Used to be great, no so much anymore","Another great product ruined. This used to be my favorite tea, but it's been changed and isn't even close to what it was. I bought a box a month ago and hoped maybe it was just a bad batch. So when it ran out I tried again, but it's exactly the same. Clearly the recipe has been changed and not for the better."
5,Best tea ever,"This tea tastes like Christmas! There is no other way to describe it. My co-workers love to walk by my desk when I have a cup of this sitting on the corner because it smells so good. It is my favorite hot tea bag. It is sweet and spicy just like the title says, no need to add any extra sweetener (which makes me happy)."
1,Disappointed,"I saw other reviews (but not for this entry) that said, ""artificial on the box"" , but ""natural"" in the AMZN write-up. Well, the other day, I got the box.. Second ingredient said, ""artificial flavoring"". Calling Good Earth Teas resulted in futility. They told me the definition of ""artificial flavoring is proprietary"" So, GET, you're telling me that I can stick a chemical of some type in my body, unaware of what it is, and expect I won't have a complication from it??. Even if I don't, the idea that y'all won't tell me what it is, concerns me, and it should concern anyone else who is drinking this ""new version"" of their tea.They also said, ""until we can find this source, it'll continue to be 'artificial'."" THEN, DON'T MAKE IT until you have the necessary ingredients!"
1,untruthful ingredients. Don't be fooled.,"Unlike the ingredients listed on this website, this Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet & Spicy tea has artificial flavor added -- and it's the third ingredient, meaning that there's more artificial flavor than all the other ingredients except for rooibos and chicory root.I feel ripped of by Amazon's dishonesty of listing ingredients from another, completely different product on the page describing this artificially flavored tea.Even worse, I received this rubbish as part of my Subscribe and Save subscription. They replaced my original subscribed product, which wasn't artificially flavored, with this junk, and didn't have the balls to mention the COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS.BUYER BEWARE."
3,Stimulating Even Without Caffeine,"This tea is probably my very favorite tasting tea ever! It is delicious hot or cold, and has a sweetness all its own so it does not need added sweetener.So why only 3 stars?? Because I have discovered that, for me and some others I know, panax ginseng is a major stimulant. Knowing that it is caffeine free I had a small glass of this tea iced one evening. That night I barely slept a wink. At first I didn't make the connection, but then I remembered that my husband has the same reaction to ginseng (and he's a person who can drink full-caf coffee at night and have no trouble sleeping).I now drink it only before noon, and that seems to be okay. Ginseng may not be stimulating to everyone, but I just wanted to mention it for those who may be like me.I notice that Good Earth's *Organic* Original does not have ginseng listed in the ingredients, so that may be a viable alternative."
2,Ingredients list wrong,"I bought this because the ingredients listed on Amazon say all natural ingredients. When I received this and read the package, the third ingredient is ""artificial flavor"". I contacted the company and they said if you want all natural ingredients you need to order the 24 bag boxes."
1,So. Disappointing.,"I've been slowly working my way through boxes of the older version of Good Earth's Sweet & Spicy tea (the pale yellow packets). As a nurse, there was nothing better at 3 am than a warm cup of this savory, sweet tea. Many of my peers would walk by and a bag would end up in their cold, tired hands as they headed for the hot water tap.Then I ran out and bought more boxes.So. Disappointing.Now, it takes two bags to achieve about 50% of the flavoring that one bag would achieve. There's now a watery, dirty taste to the tea.Unfortunately, what used to be a tea worthy of 5 stars has now dropped to 1. Maybe. Can we do less? So sad.The search for a replacement is on. Beware."
1,"Recipe changed, for the (much) worse","I used to love Good Earth tea; I drank at least one cup of the decaf every afternoon. The last time I ordered, the packaging was different (maroon instead of light yellow) and the taste was really bland. Not sweet, not spicy, not anything; almost flavorless. I am so disappointed, because I really loved the spiciness of the original recipe. I won't buy this again, I'm sad to say."
4,Taste good. . .good product,"I like the tea. I have used the blend for several years. This one didn't get the 5 stars because the stronger cinnamon flavor I got in past orders, seems to be muted in this shipment. That is not to say it isn't a good blend, it is just not the same flavor as the past ones I have had, thus the 4 stars. Still a good product and many may like the milder cinnamon flavor."
1,some thing is wrong with this tea,"I used to love this tea, I now have more than 7 boxes I can't use because it is so bitter it is disgusting. I forgot to stop the second auto ship that is why I have so much. I would like to get a refund ."
2,Does NOT taste like tea. SO sweet. If looking for a good black tea look elsewhere...,"I ordered this tea based upon it having so many positive reviews. I was looking for a new good black tea and this seemed like it might be a good choice. Let me say it again, if you are looking for good tea then this is NOT what you want. This stuff does not taste like tea at all. It is REALLY sweet (not sure how, there is no sugar or artificial sweeteners). Its as if they just grind up a bunch of cinnamon and put it in a tea bag.If you notice, most positive reviews here are from people who do not like tea normally. Just do not be fooled into thinking that you are buying a quality black tea. I may be a bit of a tea snob, but I honestly cannot stand this stuff and ended up throwing away the entire order because neither I nor my friends can stand drinking it."
3,Getting tea bags,I have got a lot from your company in the past but the tea was a flop. I was looking for green tea and ended up with regular tea. My wife wants green tea. She went to some place on the internet and got the green tea. I then could not find from the internet how to return the tea so I sent them by Mail Post back to where they came from and I hope that I get my money back.I have been with you for at least ten years but now I have trouble understanding how to go step by step to the item that I want. Either you are getting too complicated or I am getting too old to understand the way to get what I want.I always have gotten a good product; if I could just understand your website!Gerald Berge
5,not all Good Earth ORIGINAL taste the same!!!,"Caution, not all Good Earth Original Caffeine Free (or with caffeine) taste the same. This one for me is the best. I made the mistake and bought ALL NATURAL Good Earth Original and it has a weaker, less tangy taste. So now when I need to purchase more tea, I look for the same design on the box and even check the scan number 27018 30135. But the best way, is ordering on Amazon with the auto shipping every three months. This is the best tasting tea. If your a tea lover THIS IS WONDERFUL."
3,Musty?,"Has anyone else noticed a musty taste in some of this tea? When it's good, it's great; but every so often I get a teabag that smells and tastes musty. Too bad!"
5,Good Earth Tea is really GOOD,"Wonderful flavorful tea, great hot and great for Iced tea too.A little sweet, no sugar needed, The cinnamon and cloves are so refreshing and this tea goes great with cookies! Ginger snaps too.Love this tea."
1,Buyer Beware! Not 100% Natural Anymore. Artificial Flavor instead of Natural Flavor,"I purchased the 6 pack of Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet and Spicy. I was shocked when I compared the ingredients on the boxes I received to the ingredients listed on the Amazon website. Website states ""100% Natural...No artificial Flavors"". On the website, ""Natural Flavor"" is the third ingredient. On the boxes I received ""Artificial Flavor"" is the third ingredient!Good Earth was recently purchased by the Tata Beverage Group. Apparently they have chosen to enhance their profit on what used to be a quality, 100% Natural product by using inferior ingredients. I'm sure as educated consumers become aware of this change, this item will rapidly drop from it's #2 selling position at Amazon. As always, Amazon's customer servicewas excellent. They refunded my total purchase price for the item. Guess I'll donate the product to a local food bank."
4,Natural Flavor NOT Artificial Flavor,"I just received a shipment of this tea (6/24/10) and notice that on the Amazon info lists the third ingredient as ""Artificial flavor"", but the listing on the box says ""Natural flavor"" and specifically states there is no artificial flavor in it. So, don't be put off by the Amazon listing or reviews that used that as a source for their review."
1,The flavor has changed and no longer tastes good.,"I have been drinking Good Earth Sweet & Spicy tea (herbal) for years. It has been my favorite herbal tea for as long as I can remember, and I traditionally have a cup after dinner. When Costco stopped carrying a few months ago, I turned to Amazon and got six boxes in one order. Big mistake. Since the manufacturer has changed hands and the box went from light brown to purple, the tea also got seriously degraded. The difference is astounding, as I still have old tea bags from the last manufacturer and was able to directly compare. There is a distant hint of the old flavor that I pine for each time I take a sip, but what I am mostly met with is a harsh and unappealing flavor, and the longer it brews it just gets grosser rather than sweeter and spicier. It's tough to explain in words this distinct difference in flavor but trust me, it's disappointing. It is no longer the Good Earth that we all know and love so much."
1,Artificial sweetener most likely Splenda.,"This is a super sweet tea that tastes like you're sucking on a ""red hot"" candy. Because none of the ingredients listed on the box are themselves super sweet, my best guess is that the ""artificial flavor""/AF listed on the box is Splenda.If the AF was Stevia, they wouldn't need an AF disclaimer because it is natural ingredient; if it contained the other two artificial sweeteners in the pink and blue packets, they would have to include a PKU disclaimer on the box, which they do not."
1,A shadow of its former self,"The taste of this new formulation is a shadow of the original. It lacks the zip, the taste and the zing. Truly disappointing. If you compare the ingredients of this new formula to the old, you'll fing that they've cut out TONS of the great spices, etc. they originally had. Let's start a movement to bring back the old formula!"
1,Not The Real Thing,"I've been drinking this tea since the 1970's. I lived in a northern California town where there was a Good Earth Restaurant. I first had their tea there. It was like no other tea in the world!!! The new Good Earth Tea has artificial ingredients which really alter the flavor! I've read other reviews that say the non-caffine blend has no artificial flavors, I haven't tried it, but will soon, as I miss the old caffeinated one. Maybe I can make a pot and add a couple of black tea bags to the mix if I need to wake up. Anyway, it is very sad to see a quality, one of the kind item altered when it is acquired by a new company, who is trying to save money. How does that work anyway? You lose the old loyal customers and probably gain few new ones as they won't like the taste of the cheap, altered product either. I hope they wise up and go back to the original formula."
1,Not the same as the original,This tea with new packaging does not have the same great taste as the original. The flavor is less pronounced and more bitter.
1,They changed more than the packaging,"This was my favorite tea. Even though I realized it wasn't entirely natural,I was willing to forgive. I just recieved my order & it has changed for the worse. I can't drink it. It smells like old lady perfume. Can't distinguish any cinnamon. Off to find another tea to drink. I'll probably email the manufacturer. I'm not really hopeful that it will ever be changed back."
1,Sorry to see it go!,"I have been drinking and loving Good Earth Tea for years. I make it cold in the summer and hot in the winter... everyday! I ordered a case from Amazon last week and upon opening the first bag, I knew something was wrong from the smell but tried it anyway. It was horrible. I called Amazon and as always, they were wonderful about refunding my money. Then I called Good Earth and found out they changed the ingredients and some boxes are the old flavor and some are not. They said they now have 3 blends. Well, I can't begin to figure out which one I am getting so I am onto trying other types of tea! So it's been lovely but no more Good Earth tea for me!!"
1,Nothing like the original,"I have been a drinker of the original Good Earth Tea for some time now and when I saw that Amazon had it I was thrilled. I noticed that the box was different from what I had been using but it said it was the original blend so I went ahead and bought it. I just had a drink of it and poured it out. It was awful, nothing like what I have been buying. I'm so disappointed."
5,Very flavorful tea,I've had this tea before but where I live it's almost impossible to find. I love the full flavor and you can almost make two cups out of one bag. Amazon has the best price and service and that's great!
4,pleasantly surprised,"I'm not normally a tea drinker...I actually ordered this for my mom as a gift because she loves this tea so much. She got me to try it, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a subtle, yet not overpowering taste of cinnamon, and doesn't have that usual ""tea"" taste. Mixed with a bit of honey, I think I could get used to this!"
5,Unique Test - A New Favorite,"A friend of mine gave me the caffeine free version, which I loved. I had a hard time finding the tea in my local grocery stores, so I went only. I was thrilled when I noticed there was a caffeine full version so I quickly bought it. I love the unique flavors - a mix of chai, fruit and spice flavors. Also, the longer you let the tea bag sit in your cup, the stronger the taste - no bitterness like other teas here.I also love that you can buy it in bulk - in 6 boxes. I've got boxes at home, at work, a few bags in my purse and some in my Christmas room for presents."
3,Not as good as the Yellow Box Good Earth Original,"This has long be my favorite tea. It is different however with the change. The tea doesnt seem to be as strong, flavorful as before. If I were newly introduced to the tea, I would still enjoy it, but knowing the original flavor, it does seem to be somewhat diluted in the taste."
1,No Flavor!,"We've enjoyed lots of Good Earth Original sweet and spicy tea, but the stuff I received from Amazon.com is nothing like it! Good Earth tea is naturally sweet and spicy, delicious -- but the case I ordered from Amazon.com is tasteless, like drinking a cup of plain hot water! I noticed that the freshness date is still good, but I also noticed that the papers attached to the tea bag strings are dark and sticky. I think that this case of tea was not stored properly, and perhaps it was exposed to too much dampness or climate change? The little paper labels, which each have a unique inspirational verse, were almost illegible. Unfortunately I can't return the tea, so I think I will let the Good Earth tea manufacturers know about it. Perhaps it was an error made on the part of the manufacturers."
1,"Used to be excellent, formula changed","This used to be my favorite tea, but the formula has changed. I've heard that if you can find the tea in the original pale yellow box, that it is still the old (good tasting) formula. Read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info (and notice the dates on the reviews, good and bad). It used to taste like a liquid fireball candy, now it tastes like hot water with black pepper."
4,The artificial flavor controversy,"(3/12) I have purchased this product in the past and it was all natural. When I purchased this time I found that it contained artificial flavor. I contacted Good Earth because I was so upset at the change in their product. They informed me that they make a version with artificial flavor and one without as well as organic. The organic does not contain artificial flavor. Since it seems to be a game of change as to whether you get artificial flavor or not when ordering this product. If it is important to you that it be all natural, I recommend getting the organic variety."
1,Sorely disappointed and mislead on ingredients,"For some reason Good Earth Original Caffeine Free, Sweet & Spicy Herbal Tea has switched from Natural flavors to Artifical flavors.For what reason?I didn't buy this tea to consume ARTIFICIAL flavors, or I'd have bought a different tea.I resent the change. Cancel my subscription.Is this the impact of Globalization or simply TATA Enterprises dumbing down the product?"
1,"If you liked the old ""Original,"" do not purchase the new packaging.","Not good. I was a a huge fan of the Original blend, but when they changed their packaging, they also changed the recipe. It has a very odd smell and I had to throw the cup of tea away. I actually bought another box thinking that the first box I purchased was somehow defective. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It's their new recipe. I will have to find another comfort tea enjoy. The strong cinnamon aroma and flavor that I loved so much is now gone. So sad."
1,The new formula is AWFUL!,I've been drinking Good Earth tea for years and have had frequent comments from co-workers about the wonderful scent. Not any more. I don't know what changed but I ended up dumping most of every cup down the drain. Headed out today to find a new tea. Very sad.
3,Make the bad woman stop,"The first couple of moments are fantastic, until the horrid screeching that is. Lords of darkness cringe and pray that that soul never makes it to hell. If it does then just use the screaming to torture others. I would have rated it higher if the vocalist had a true voice. The music in its self is superb."
4,A great album,This album is one of their best. Its not like their masterpiece Cruelty And The Beast but it is a good one. A must buy for Cradle of filth fans and to people who will like something like Atmospheric Black metal with the characteristic vocals of Dani. The melodies are very good and is very easy - listening giving you a vampire and gothic (and cool) atmosphere. A great piece of work.
2,good for scaring off crows,"This cd has its good points and its bad points. Good points are the skill of the musicians; the gothic themes sounded good what I could hear of it---then there is the bad, and it ruins the album, the singer sounds like someome has put his nuts in a vice and is squeezing them. or it sounds like a cat that has been thrown in a bonfire. There is low growls that don't sound too bad, but the high screeching noise the singer makes ruins this ablbum. There is a female reciting poitry!!! Why dosen't she sing, it may have saved this horror, I would recomend this cd to the military to use as a torture device for prisoners"
2,Not what I was expecting,"After hearing so much hype about this Cradle of Filth band, I decided to download this album off the internet. Man, was I glad I didn't buy it.First of all, let me state that I am usually very open of any metal record. Heavy Metal is one of my favorite genres of music, along with classical and progressive rock. Anyways, when I first heard this cd, I actually liked the guitar riffs and growling vocals. However, the high pitched screeching was a MAJOR turnoff. It sounded terrible with the rest of the music and drove me insane. Also, I'm not big on the lyrics. I'm really not into that whole vampire thing.Recommended if you enjoy hissing vocals and a gothic image. For better extreme metal, I'd check out Opeth or Children of Bodom."
5,sherbert is for little girls ::sigh::,"we all know sherbert is for little girls right and they have these stupid rainbow colors in it.but thts not it(this is the worst part)it now has tiny little STUPID sprinkles! but anyways my nipples look like milk duds (just a lil' bit) my depends are red BUT NOW THEY ARE BLUE LMAO!!!! Water: For Health, For Healing, For Life: You're Not Sick, You're Thirsty! remember that people and also remeber that sherbert=little girls and my nipples = milk duds"
2,Lyrics that spoil a really good sound,"To be blunt this album is really, really not that good. I do however think that the music is good, I'm afraid the lyrics just ruin what could be a really good sound. The lyrics are sung in a high pitched, and really quite silly way, they ruin the backing of the other band members. If you are a hard core Cradle of Filth fan by this album now, it is just more of the same, you'll love it. It's just this album really isn't my thing. If your not a hard core fan, only buy this to annoy everyone in your street, or buy it for a laugh."
1,the most overrated band on earth,"Put this into your mind: CoF is not black metal, never was and never will be. This is heavy metal dressed as black metal. Think Judas Priest or Iron Maiden turned gothic, disguised in black leather with pseudo corpse paint. Clowns and rip-off artists. How many albums can you put out to please the fans (Ha!) so you can cash in the money? False, false, false! Everything on this album spells fake, from Dani's stupid screeching to the Oh so Gothic keyboard intros... This is not art: this is showbusiness. They are the Celine Dion of metal. I threw this CD in the recycling bin. Avoid!"
2,Dust and lack of talent,"I bought this album because I was bored and it looked like some kind of Type O Negative knock off. I'm always up for something new so off I went to go play it. I had heard alot about this band in the past, not ever about the style of music though, mainly about their t-shirts. Now I can see why. The music is your typical romp through the typical metal forest and the vocals are beyond bad on the ears.Ok, so maybe they'll have good lyrics I thought. Um, no. The lyrics were beyond shallow and cliche. It was the typical ""oo satan satan"". King Diamond did this and it wasn't impressive when he did it. This cd is just your typical romp through mediocre metal and horrible written lyrics and for a bonus they have a vocalist who needs to take some lessons.If metal is your thing though, you may like the structure of the music, it isn't horrible if you aren't looking for anything fresh and you like the whole ""heard it before"" thing."
1,Garbage,"I seen the cover, I was very impressed, song titles did draw me to buy the cd, but my God, how could anyone stand that screaching, I was impressed by the guitar work, but like most metal today, has anyone forgoten how to SING, it was the worst 20 bucks I have ever spent, not inspiring at all, I wouldnt recomend this album to a friend or an emeny, well maybe an enemy, if they could endure the pain of listening to it."
1,uhh not black metal,"Real Black Metal = Bathory, Immortal, Satyricon, Darkthrone, Dark Funeral, Mayhem, Emperor, etc...Cradle Of Filth = MTV Black Metal Wanna-bes.A Gothic Romance?hah"
1,Can't go lower than 1 star?,Get this piece of trash away from me. Noise... screams... organs... vampires? Thats... fruity.
1,What?,"Is this to be taken seriously? For those who have been wondering what ever happened to the Wicked Witch from the Wizard of Oz, she (ok, he) has taken to laying down vocals for this troop.If this is a joke or parody, I get it and it's funny. If not, puh-leeze. I kept waiting to hear the words ""I'll get you my pretty...and your little dog too."" In fact, 45 Grave (and I suppose, The Misfits and Samhain) pulled off this type of ""joke"" better, albeit with slightly less musical sophistication...I will however say this about this release: musically, the craftmanship is pretty decent. Otherwise, try to avoid this."
5,one of their best ever!,Cradle Of Filth definitely shows thier talent with this one. I own all of their albums and this is one i never get tired of! If you are looking for music to dream to (in a gothic sense) then this is definitely for you! I give this album 5 stars because it shows what true black metal should sound like. I definitely recommend this one!
5,The best Cradle album I've heard,"Cradle Of Filth was a band reccomended to me and I wasn't sure what I'd think, but once I put this cd in my player, I fell in love with Cradle's style...they totally rock...Dani's vocals are done in a unique way and mix well with the gothic keyboards, dark guitars, and rapid-fire drums...nothing can compare...everytime I listen to my Cradle cd's I expect to hear crowds cheering before and after the songs since they have so much power in their music...I can't wait to get a live album (if one exists)..."
5,SUPREME ROMANTIC DECADENCE!,It's like an orgasm which never stops as i'll play it again and again. I've been listening this album propably over 100000 times and i still find new atmospherics from it. I like theme in the album more than it was in Cruelty... the vampiric motion and bloodlust...
3,"Good Songs, Bad Production","There is some really good music on this album. I love the intro to ""Haunted Shores,"" and the melodies on ""Malice Through the Looking Glass."" Unfortunately, I could never really get into Dusk because of its low-quality production, especially on the vocals. I know there are black metal purists who like its rawness, but I wish it were produced more like Cruelty. It will be interesting to see what songs they choose from this album to be on their orchestral album."
4,In Their Prime,"I remember when Cradle of Filth were shocking and their music akin to black sabbath. While this album is their biggest seller, it's their most accessable. Their distribution deal got them into mainstream stores like Best Buy, etc. The music itself here is still some of their best material they've written before or since, this is like a nostalgia trip to be revisited. This was the days before they got on Ozzfest. Key tracks are: Heaven Torn Asunder, Malice Through the Looking Glass, and Funeral in Carpathia. Starting with Midian they would become predictable, losing most of their audience with Nympatemine. I saw them on the Midian and Damnation tours. Not really they souled out, just lack of interest following the band for 7 years."
5,A great effort by Cradle of Filth,"Dusk and Her Embrace is a very good recording released back when CoF wasn't a very well known band. i'm not shure if you would call this Black Metal, because to me it sounds more like Gothic Metal, but what ever it is it definetaly delivers. the best songs are probably Heavan Torn Asunder and A Gothic Romance.9/10"
5,Haunting keyboards ... very good.,"This album is, in my opinion, Cradle of Filth at their best. With haunting kayboards, back-up female vocals at times adding to the eerieness. Honestly, CoF is the only ""metalish"" band I like( well besides Mortiis...but they arent really metal at all except a few minor songs). I usually listen to DeathRock and Goth, or Dartkwave, but CoF have a ""metal"" sound like no other band does, they are inspired by orchestral music, and thats what sets them apart from other acts, simply calling them ""black metal"" would be a shame...If you have a diverse taste in music, or you like keyboard pounding ,haunting ""metal"", then pick this up, or even if you like Darkwave. Overall: 5 stars- David Painter 1334"
4,Cradle and their embrace,"Even this album is not a pure, raw black metal, is a very good album, with the Elizabeth Bathory concept in it, nothing to do with their latest albums, here the music is not so comercial and is more interesting. I like it"
5,THE UPMOST UNHOLY,"I DO BELEIVE THAT ""DUSK AND HER EMBRACE"" IS ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC AND EERIE GOTHIC ALBUMS I OWN...THE LYRICS UNHOLY YET ADDICTING......"
1,Not worth 1 star,"I strongly suggest to music stores taking this worthless junk off the shelves and putting it in the fireplace.Just like all black/death metal,it's that bad.If you like mindless idiots screaming their no talent lungs out this is the band for you.If you like talented musicians,look elsewhere(Dave Matthews,Aerosmith,Guns N Roses(Appetite For Destruction)."
4,"Bright sound, better tempi","I find this version of ""pictures..."" very interesting. The balance of the orchestra is very good, the tempi in certain passages, like the initial promenade, are very controlled, and it gives a real aura of relax. The idea is that we enjoy this sweet walk trough the gallery. With this version, the crescendos and the volumes of the instruments gives us and interesting perspective. I recommend this version, is better than the version with Muti and the Philadelphia orchestra (Muti runs, and the final taste is not so good)."
2,Background noises are distracting,"Although I enjoy the feeling that I am sitting in the orchestra when I listen, there is a great deal of background noise, coughing, breathing, instrument noises (valves, movement, etc.) and ambient room noises, that one would not expect to hear in a professional recording. It sounds almost as though the recording was made in full during live performance, then split into tracks. Percussion isn't crisp and clear, many entrances of instruments are slightly imprecise. Some movements feel disjointed, others are perfectly timed. If you want the feel of being in the audience to listen live, this is a good recording for you. If you are distracted, as I am, by the noises of the audience (or ill orchestra members), you may want to find a different recording."
2,Little River Band goes hard rock.,"The beginning of the end for Little River Band.After ditching lead singer Glenn Shorrock and key harmony man Beeb Birtles,the band decided to go hard rock,but the changes were too much for fans with the album only reaching to number 75 on the Billboard charts and the ""Playing to Win"" single only reaching number 60.The band members heavily promoted the album on US radio,even changing their name temporarily to LRB but to no avail.New lead singer John Farnham provides some good vocals on songs like ""Blind Eyes"" and the title song,but the hard rock did not suit the bands harmony style.Had they stuck to the soft rock style of the previous ""The Net"" album,they might have had continued success,but with the loss of Beeb Birtles backing harmonies and the change to hard rock,it just fell apart.Fans didn't reject John Farnham,they rejected Graham Goble's hard rock experiment."
5,Perfect!,"I just dug up this CD from my older CD box the other day. I forget what an incredible listening pleasure I get from it. It is such a good example of good art: varied elements that complement each other, creating colors of profound meaning-- even if it isn't clear upon an initial listening. For example, with the Party piece, is he saying that the only good party is a party that doesn't exist, or is it a statement about the dangers of imagination or laziness?Just when you think john S. Hall is on the verge of self-loathing, he picks you right back up with morbid commercials or banal yet intriguing cancer metaphors. I just wish he would have made more CD's like this-- i don't think that his band (king missile) ever quite achieved the delicate mergence of spoken word and music like it is presented here."
2,Nothing like the picture,"The actual branch is nothing like what is pictured. No branches, nothing to climb on, almost like a log or piece of driftwood."
5,A Wake-up Call for Americans,"I just (July 2007) acquired my new copy coming from Amazon. I lost my old copy in 1995. I was not naive about politics and government in 1995. Any scintillas of trust in politics and government,are now gone for even more different reasons. This book seems to keep me awake and keeps my ears wider open to what can happen in this country and this world. It is not just about the shameful and bloody acts in our westward expansion. The word ""treaty"" from these times is a joke. I can also see more about international expansions. America makes large wrongs, as do other countries do to their own people in history. My heart feels buried because Americans, we, made such innumerable, horrendous and cruel acts. This book remains to me as a great ""jolt"" to my consciousness. He put together a great example of what America did do to the Native American Peoples. Look at the status of the Native American Peoples who are left today."
5,Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,Absolutely one of the most thought provoking books I have read. I enjoyed this book so much I did not want to put it down nor have it end.
5,Well-written tragedy of the American West,"This book was very well written and provided heartbreaking, and often graphic, insight into the other side of the American West. This book will tear at your heart when you read how time and time again the Indians were betrayed ... and the manner in which they were slaughtered. I had to put the book down several times because I found the stories to be so heartbreaking. But I highly recommend it to anyone who truly wants to know what really happened to the Indians at the hands of the white settlers."
3,I need maps!,"I became very frustrated reading this book because of the lack of maps. It is nevertheless, a very moving telling of the biggest land grab in our nation's history."
5,You can't go past this book!!!,"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee, really shows the true spirit of the American Indians. Dee Brown really tells their side of the story, from the depths of their heart-ache at what they lost, to the power and courage expressed in their desperate fight to keep what they had managed to save....it's true...the only way you will ever know what an American Indian is, is by knowing what the American Indians were."
5,Other Books,"The historical account of what happened to the native Americans during the white settlement of the United States of America. This ranges from resettlement to out and out slaughter, rape and massacre. It also goes into detail about the propaganda, legal systems and economic problems of the time, as well."
1,Indian Apologetics,"I suppose Dee Brown is not to blame; after all, he subtitled this book ""An Indian History of the American West"". That pretty much says it all for this one-sided, biased, presentation of the clash of cultures which inevitably would result in the extermination of one or the other. If attaining victimhood and sympathy for Indians is the goal, this book succeeds; if the painful truth regarding the bloody massacres perpetrated by both sides is the goal, try a balanced account such as Utley and Washburn's ""Indian Wars"". One reviewer stated his desire that this book be made required reading in schools and colleges...unfortunately, that is the case, it's only too bad that no corrective, balanced account is also made required reading."
5,Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee,"I first thought it wouldn't be a good book. However I was wrong,it was excellent. As they say ""You can't judge a book by its cover. It is about these different tribes of indians who are trying to keep their land from the settlers by fighting for it. The general General Canby offers to make peace with the chief Little Crow. They meet under a flag of truce (surrender). They shake hands and Little Crow lets the soilders go. Then however Canby strikes the indians again even after surrendering with Little Crow. The rest I will let you find out for yourself."
4,Original Eye-Opener,This book was and contines to be a wake-up call to the asleep teaching of American History. Especially that of Native Americans and most notably our utter ignorance of our history with Latin America.
5,Required reading for all US citizens.,Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee describes the intelligence and courage of the great American indian chiefs and the deceit that was used to conquer them. I strongly recommend this book for the awareness of events that it brings and the strategic lessons it teaches.It will touch your heart and mind in ways that change you forever.
5,the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth,"i have just finished this book and i think it will take me a long time to get it out of my mind. i found this book sad and at times had to put it down just to clear my head. i feel ahamed to be white and as i live in england i was ignorant to the terrible sufferings of the ""red indian"".i feel compelled to read more and wish to learn as much as possible about this noble, honest, kind race.if i could swap places with a ""red indian"" i would be proud to do so.may you weep no more."
5,Bury my heart at wounded knee,"I already had a paperback edition ,but this book is so beautifully excecuted ,that I can't leave it in the bookcase.H.Veraart"
5,Definitely an eye opener!,"I'm glad that I read this book. I have never read about history from this point of view. It was moving! This version was written for young adults, and I feel that students should be required to read this at least in high school. Many people will be moved to tears and heartbroken as I was."
5,A Classic,This book is truely a classic and a big inspiration for my own work on the Lakota Sioux who escaped to Canada.They Never Surrendered: The Lakota Sioux Band That Stayed In Canada
4,Bury my heart or broken promises,Great book. Should be mandatory reading. Details precisely all the broken promises and treaties and how the US consistently went back on its words with regard to the Indians.
5,A life changing book,"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is one of those books whose importance is beyond the writing, it is a force in history itself. It changed American opinion regarding the Native American population, humanizing them in the face of extreme predjudice at the time of publication. This is one of the books everyone should read-and pass along."
3,Interesting,"Good read, but very long chapters. Wish it was broken up more. Each chapters starts out with quick history that occured."
5,"Exactly as described, good price","The book came exactly as described and quickly. I'm yet to read it, but all the reviews on it are great."
5,Terrific Shirt!!,"I bought this shirt on a whim for my Husband for Father's Day!! When he tried on the shirt and found out the price, he promptly ordered two more!! It feels good and fits good!! He loves it and the price is GREAT!!"
3,Much uglier when it arrives.,"Yeah, it's the exact same shirt but it is REALLY ugly full sized. Oh well, for $2 who cares?"
1,Review Bill Blass Men's SS Camp Shirt,"Disposable shirt, wear once and throw away. Washed it and it literally began to fall apart and unravel. Not worth even the $5 bucks I paid for it."
1,"Excuse me Brian , but you dropped something.","Brian, what should we do with these 19 short throw away pieces laying around the studio? Just DROP them onto a CD and my loyal neibob fans will eat them up. Lite piano pieces followed by mysterious thumping tunes followed by ambient snippets then carnival electronica and back to the piano. Short disconnected noninnovative electronica. The cornerstone ""Iced world"" (the reason I purchased this CD) sounds like Lalo Schifrin's prelude music to the famous Bullitt car chase scene.... Build it and they will buy. Bye bye Bri."
4,Poignant and Sensitive,A captivating story of two people in pain finding solace by sharing feelings with each other. The technique of storytelling through letters felt personal and revealing. I found the story warm and hopeful.
5,A BOOK FOR SENIORS!,"HEARD ABOUT THIS BOOK AND ORDERED 4 COPIES TO USE AS CHANUKAHPRESENTS FOR CHILDREN IN MY FAMILY. I AM A 75 YEAR OLD ""KID"" WHOAFTER A GLANCE AT THIS BEAUTIFULLY BOUND VOLUME (INCORRECTLYLABELED AS A ""PAPERBACK"") THOUGHT I SHOUD READ A PAGE OR TWO! I LITERALLY COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. THE TIMING (THIS BEING THE350TH YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF JEWS IN AMERICA) PROMPTED ME A BIT. IAM OF TRADITIONAL BACKGROUND AMD WAS FASCINATED WITH THE MARVELOUS IDEAS ALL INCORPORATED INTO ONE SMALL BOOK. A REALSPELLBINDER AND A TREASURE AND I AM RECOMMENDING IT TO EVERYONE I KNOW!"
5,Very easy to use!,"Opens the can so easily, I did it twice the first time I used it because I thought it didn't cut!Highly recommended."
3,Not that easy to turn,"Bought based on America Test Kitchen's rating, I'm getting used to the ""safety lid"" model, and it works fine. But a couple of nitpicky things: A) I find it hard to turn...not for anyone with carpal tunnel or arthritis, for sure B) I always have to move the ""crank"" to expose the little pinchers that you need to remove the cutaway lid, and C) I can no longer put the cutaway lid inside my empty can for recycling. Yeah, nitpicky, but it's the small things when you're talking about a can opener. If it's still opening cans five years from now without any gear slippage, I'll make sure to up my rating. : )"
5,An instant favorite,"You may want to keep your old opener around, but you won't want to use it unless you have to. This opener is fantastic!"
3,Not as advertised. Not exactly dishwasher safe,"This can opener is advertised as dishwasher safe which was a big plus for me. However, no where on the packaging does it say dishwasher safe. On the back of the packaging is a little picture of a dishwasher with a black slash across it. I think this means that it's not dishwasher safe. I even emailed the manufacturers and here's what they said about it:""We do not recommend putting any of our safety lidlifters in the dishwasher. The best cleaning method is to use a soft, damp cloth.""So where does amazon get the idea that this is dishwasher safe???"
2,Great when it worked,"I have owned this product for 2 years now. I really wanted to like this product and thought I found the perfect can opener. It worked great for the first couple of months until it started slipping, the can opener would stay stationary even though I was turning the knob. Often times I would have to reposition the can opener and do a do over. By doing so, it creates tiny metal shavings that can get mixed into your food while removing the lid. I contacted the manufacturer to voice out my complaint and they were very prompt at sending me a new one at no cost to me. I received the replacement and gave it a try, I was hoping that maybe the first one I received was just a dud. Unfortunately, the replacement also slips so I am still on the hunt for a good can opener."
2,Can Opener?,Wanted a safety can opener and I have kind of a red thing going on so I ordered this 'can opener'. The first one I got would not open any cans whatsoever so I sent it back. The second one opens some cans but not all. It has a hard time opening cans with pull tops like pet food cans. It's uncomfortable to use and just does a poor job in general. One advantage of safety openers is the ability to use the top for storage which is ideal for pet food. I have a cheap generic opener I've had for years but is now getting a bit dull. The cheap one will run laps around this thing.
2,Poor quality,"I had this can opener for about a month before it stripped out. I liked the fact that the edges were not sharp, but I don't want to buy one a month!"
5,Swiss Wonder - Can Opener,"This product is amazing. Once you play around with it and figure it out, you will never go back to anyother method; unless it is a Swiss Army Knife can opener in the wild. Buy it with confidence."
4,Does the job,"This is a lightweight and simple version of the 'sideways' can openers. I've used another that was a bit heavier and perhaps better built, but it was also far more expensive.This one takes moderate effort, but seems to do the trick. It should also survive a few drops on the ground (but not too many). For the price, very happy."
2,"replacing the lid is nice, but it does not always work","The ability to replace the lid is nice, and so is no sharp edges thing if you are clumsy or have kids, but I regretfully found out it does not open all cans. Out of maybe 5 or 6 I tried, it could not handle one. What good is it if you have to get another can opener?Even when it does open cans, it is not the most user-friendly can opener I've had (and I've only had two cheap ones ever before, haha). It sometimes slips and you have to re-place it and continue, which is annoying and tricky because the spot where you stopped is not easily visible.In short, you have to value the advantages pretty highly in order to overcome the disadvantages."
2,Good idea but poor design,I was looking for a can opener that cuts around the rim instead of the top of the can because I don't like lids falling into the food while it is still in the can. The problem with this one is that the handles are stacked and difficult to open/close. You have to slide the handles left to right instead of up and down. Rather difficult and I have strong hands.
1,A waste of money,"This thing is a disaster. It's not intuitive to use and took many frustrating minutes to figure it out, even with the instructions. (Should a can opener really require written instructions?) It's very fickle about fitting exactly right on the can and only works on certain size cans. This thing won't fit ergo won't open anything larger than a standard tuna or soup can."
3,Fair opener,"This opener is great when it works. The problem is that it doesn't always work. Sometimes it does not cut deeply enough into the can, and it is difficult to get the top off."
4,Great !,"When I first got this out of the package and saw the instructions on how to use it I thought "" What a pain"" but, it was easy to use. My old Safety can opener didn't always work right so I was hesitant about getting another one but, this one worked great. Very smooth and easy when turning the handle. Now I will see if it withstands the test of time."
2,Great while it lasted,The first one of these I owned lasted a couple of years. A replacement one lasted only a couple of months. Got a Farberware instead. Farberware is less intuitive but has not broken after several months.
2,Wouldn't open cans,"I bought this based on mostly good reviews after another Kuhn Rikon wouldn't open a can of Rotel. Not only did this not open the Rotel, but it took 3 trips around a regular can of beans to open it, and it left a sliver of metal to fall in the beans. I gave up on ""safety lid"" openers and bought a regular one. Might be defective."
3,ok,"I bought these as gifts for two ladies, as gifts. as to how well they work I do not know. I use one that I have had for number of years, and like very much, does not have, the biters on it for lifting the lids. The turn knob split and years ago, I used super glue on it and clamped for 3 or 4 days till well set. still works fine. I have bought several over the years as gifts for other people for safty reasons, so they do not not get cuts. Some day I will need to replace mine, if I can afford one at that time."
2,Kuhn Rikon Slim Safety Lid Lifter,"Well, it took two cans and several tries before I could get the lid off one of the cans. Needed to use another can opener to open the first can. Ended up putting in junk drawer."
2,Not as advertised,"The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because what I got was not what was advertised. 1) handle is completely different. 2) There is no push button release on beak, you have to spread the handle apart, very awkward. They might of given me the cheaper model, it works ok once you get used to it but its not as great as raved about in reviews. I do like the clean cut and how the metal doesn't touch the food, but I had to go over oval lids a few times to receive a clean cut."
4,It just works!,"What else is there to say when a product does what it's supposed to do better than anything else you have found on the market. If you need a can open, this is the best bang for the buck."
4,Lorca According To Merwin,"Leaves me wanting to discover the real Lorca andnot so much of the impersonal 'scholar' poetrypicked by Mr. Merwin. If you have not seen themovie ""Little Ashes,"" or read ""The Killing ofFederico Garcia Lorca,"" you will understandwhat I mean. Search them on Amazon.com."
5,Book in excellent condition,This book arrived in a timely fashion in excellent condition. I appreciate the high-quality service.
5,"Praise Jeebus, it's a miracle","Well, after reading the reviews for these, and for similar items, I really did not want to order these online and have them delivered. I figured they'd arrive broken and I'd have to return them. After going to 5 places (Pottery Barn, Target, Crate and Barrel, Sur La Table and William Sonoma) without finding anything like what I wanted I bit the bullet and ordered these. Miracle of miracles, they arrived today in perfect shape! It's a miracle because, as the other reviewers said, the packing was seriously inadequate. The original box was just placed inside another box. The outer box wasn't even marked ""Fragile"". I guess the UPS folks were feeling very gentle this last week. Anyway, I think they're pretty cool and if you order them I hope they come to you intact!"
1,Also Arrived BROKEN !!!!,"No packing material what so ever. Product arrived broken. I'm sending it back for a replacement but if the second one comes broken too, then that will be it for me ordering breakable items from Target."
2,Could've been great....,"....but 2 of the bowls were broken on arrival, so I returned it. The packaging was very poor and didn't protect the bowls at all."
1,broken,"this product does not come with a fragile label. therefore the shippers throw the box around and break them. The first set I ordered came completely shattered. I sent them back and then the second set I got also came completely shattered. I am not trying for a third, I am just getting my money back."
3,Broken upon receipt!,These are OK but really not the best quality... They serve a purpose but I am not even sure if they are oven safe. We put them in but I'd be careful.... Not too expensive so I guess you get what you pay for!
1,ARRIVED BROKEN TOO!,"They didn't learn how to package fragile items. I""ve gotten clothes better wrapped than this! There wasn't any bubble wrap or the like in the package! Most of the crocks were broken."

2,Cermaic Onion Soup Crocks: Broken pieces,"Speedy delivery, but no good: One of the crocks arrived already broken. Protective packaging is still minimal, so no wonder. Just cannot recommend ordering them..."
2,WASTE OF TIME,"As one who appreciates film noir and 50's era glamour, this movie is worth watching........but only for viewing the production design and settings. The plot is abysmally plodding and all speculation. Nothing is solved. There is no conclusion. If you don't have any paint to stare at until it dries, this would be your second choice."
3,Good Flick,This is an interesting movie. A little slow moving but it keeps you in there till it picks up. I enjoyed the story and period costums.
5,Great movie,Very nuanced movie that as far as I know received little press. Well acted and interesting take on a figure many no longer recall. I watched Reeves' Superman on TV as a mainstay growing up. Very good flick.
3,The legend endures.,"I can recall when The Adventures Of Superman was prime time television and I never missed an episode. This movie although it could have been better was the first effort ever to shed some light on the life and bizzare, tragic death of the best Superman ever: George Reeves."
3,Another one,Still no answers to what really happened. You have to make your own decision on what might of happened.Wasn't bad but could have been much better.
3,Great HD quality until the picture froze,Thank God for Combo discs. The HD quality was amazing on the Xbox 360 HD player until the picture froze completely with about 30 minutes to go. After 3 restarts i gave up and watched the SD side.
3,Was ok nothing grand,"A movie about the possible murder of an actor who played superman in TV series. Incidentally he is also a Reeve (George Reeves) like the Chirstopher Reeve who was to take over a superman in the movie. Plays itself as a whodunnit but does not reach to any conclusion as it is based on a true story. The case was closed as a suicide but along the movie we find a low life private investigator played by Adrien Brodie try to understand and through his mind's eye we see three possible ways in which Reeves could have died including the official suicide scenario. It's a run of the mill movie which you know cannot provide you anything startling as it has to stay true to the fact. So you kind of know it's destined to an anti-climatic end but you stick around for the period sets and costumes and the acting. I felt the movie was ok nothing grand.regards, Vikram"
3,A STORY OF THE 50'S,"2006. First movie by TV director Allen Coulter (Rome, the Sopranos). Not bad. A L.A. private eye tries to discover who killed Ben Affleck who impersonates Superman in a TV show. Just not bad."
1,"Shallow, irresponsible, over-long","It's really terrible the way a fine man like George Reeves can get thoroughly trashed in the course of making a third-rate, unsatisfying detective story. Never mind that they try to tell you this is a ""fact-based"" story of George Reeves. The movie is actually about some fictional slimy PI, a story no one would or should care about--so they attached that story to George Reeves by using some names and places. Affleck never comes close to Reeves' on-screen charisma. Reeves is portrayed as a one-dimensional, weak, whining loser, nothing at all like the real man and nothing about his real life and achievements make it into this film.Like I said, this movie is actually a boring PI story. Someone at Universal figured they could salvage the film by attaching a facade of history to it, and throwing in some ""name"" actors. It's still a total waste of time, and what it does to the memory of Reeves is a crime."
3,Superman investigated,I enjoyed this movie..was slow @ times. I think the box office numbers pretty much showed it's success. Affleck was good as George Reeves.
2,Hollywoodland,"This movie wasn't anything like I thought it would be. As a matter of fact, we fell asleep watching it, that's how boring it was."
1,Is this a way to honor the origional Superman?,"I haven't seen this movie, but please, hear me out. This is about the murder and/or suicide of George Reeves (My money's on murder) and it was released at the worst time (The same year when ""Superman Returns"".) Don't buy this movie, instead spend your money on a few ""Adventures of Superman"" DVD Boxed sets. That's a good way to remember Reeves, not this. Also I recomend the ""Superman: The Movie"" 4-disck DVD collectors edition and ""Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut"" which is a good way to remember Christopher Reeve, just don't watch this movie."
3,"TV's Man of Steel commit suicide or was he murdered, you decide","The True story of Hollywood's most notrious unsolved mystery comes to the screen as millions of TV viewers went into sadness by the death of George Reeves, TV's Superman in the 1952-1958 series ""the Adventures of Superman"" & detective Louis Simo is on the case of this beloved star. a solid twist & turn crime drama, an edge of your seet drama that leaves you with begging one question, did he commit suicide or was he murdered, whatever you think when you see this Hollywood puzzle movie, Adrien Brody & Ben Affleck are terrific, Diane Lane is terrifically sexy. If you like mysteries or real life Hollywood movies, see ""Hollywoodland"""
1,Hollywoodland,"I was not impressed with this movie at all. It was very poorly done and was a waste of time watching it. It jumped around so much, you had trouble keeping up with what time they were in."
3,Interesting But Slowwwwwww Hollywood Mystery,"Going into this film, I had really high expectations. Don't get me wrong, the script is fine, the acting superb(minus Ben Affleck), and the casting ingenious. BUT, the film is as slow as watching molasses pour. Another annoying problem----Ben Affleck's performance as George Reeves. Affleck resembles Reeves sort of, but he plays him as Ben Affleck. Affleck can be a pretty good actor---he was amazing in ""Good Will Hunting"" and was sadly overlooked for a best supporting Oscar nomination that year, but here he plays himself----a major debit.Diane Lane and expecially Adrian Brody are both exceptional. I wouldn't be surprised come Oscar time if they weren't both nominated for their performances.If you must see this at a theater, be sure to take a long nap beforehand. Although not sleep inducing while watching, you will be groggy afterwards."
2,Mildly entertaining...,"but in the end, it sort of falls flat. The main reason is because the film refuses to take a position. It doesn't have to be the truth, but just this detective's point of view or position. Instead, in the end, the message is: we don't what happened. Geez, I sat through all that to be back where I started? And as much as I like Brody, his character in this film is dull as dishwater. I care nothing about him or his issues. Why should I? This film shouldn't even be about him. Affleck, compare to his usual flare, did a decent job, but it's still not anything to really write home about. I thought Diane Lane was the most impressive by far. This film will keep your attention if you have nothing else to do, but there are other ways to pass the time."
3,Great Movie,"Great acting, strong supporting cast. This movie was interesting and made you think about what was going on. Definately worth the time and money."
3,"Philip Marlowe of our sweet, dark times","The backstage and subconscious of the private-eye stereotype, or would the hero of, say, Nicholson in Polanski's Chinatown be able to carry a family life and help raising his son?Without ever forgetting the mysterious blackness and suspense of a lone investigator in the corrupt jungle (""LA Confidential"" (1997) would first come to mind), the film is able to create an interesting identity between the hunter and the hunted (victim of a suspicious murder). Brilliant!"
3,kudos for Ben Affleck,"Ben affleck has deservedly gotten a bad rap for his acting in some of his past films.i personally feel he has a likeable and watchable quality,even in his bad roles.when i first heard he was going to play the role steve reeves in this film i just couldnt imagine him doing it.but suprise suprise! he really nails it! thats what makes this film so interesting to watch. overall this is awell done interesting and competant film. a step above most of the drek thats out there i enjoyed it and i think you will too. lets just hope that Ben continues to grow as an actor like his buddy matt damon. he definitly shows his potential here."
3,a slow starter,"This is a film which does not grab you by the throat and draw you in. You have to be alert and persist with the script and it is only when you are well into the third quarter that the parallels between Adrian Brodie's detective and George Reeve begin to manifest themsleves and one's interest is heightened. As such, this is not a film to watch late at night unless you are looking for a soporific."
5,AND THE AMERICAN WAY,"An unexpected nuanced and mature performance from Ben Affleck propels this moody look at SUPERMAN George Reeves and the events leading up to and including his alleged suicide. Using factual information, the movie explores the possibility that the washed up actor may have been murdered.Director Allan Coulter smoothly switches between the current investigation (in 1959) by boozy PI Adrien Brody (his best work since THE PIANIST) and the tragic rise and fall of George Reeves, an actor whose career soared---and then crashed--because of his identification as the man of steel. Affleck is superb in his portrayal of a handsome young man whose drive for fame succumbs to its own price. Diane Lane is great as his ""benefactress/mistress"" who is married to mob-connected Bob Hoskins. The movie captures the feel of the 50s LA, and it uses a parallel storyline concerning Brody's estranged family and shows us what the true side of Hollywood is all about.An excellent film."
4,"Excellent performances make for an entertaining, engaging film","Ben Affleck shines in an intentionally understated portrayal of TV's Superman, George Reeves. Reeves, who resisted the Superman role and tried desperately to return to more serious acting, finally succumbed to his chronic depression and killed himself in 1959--or did he? In this fictional account, down and out private detective Louis Simo (Adrien Brody) sets out to discover just that. Oscar-winner Brody delivers and excellent performance; his Simo is struggling with his own muddled life, which allows the character (and the viewer) to draw parallels between himself and the doomed Reeves. In the end, the film suggests that Reeves's death may not have been much of a mystery after all, but the theme of a life tragically lost is still evident, along with the hope that things can always change for the better. Excellent supporting performances from Diane Lane and Bob Hoskins round out this enjoyable and thoroughly engaging movie."
2,Poor Recording Quality,"I just got this CD and was quite disappointed. The song's of course are great, but the recording quality of this CD is horrendous. I ripped it to disk and analyzed it with Sound Forge and the right channel is highly clipped on many of the songs and that makes the stereo balance favor the right channel too much. I have the LP of Walk Don't Run Vol. 2 and except for the obvious record hiss and scratches, the sound is MUCH more balanced and clear on the LP.If you can find these albums on a different label, give that a shot because this label definitely destroyed the quality!"
5,Fabulous Recording!!!!!!!,"The Ventures' drive changed with the addition of drummer Mel Taylor in mid 1963. His drumming made the group more hard rocking and energetic. Howie Johnson's good, but rather quiet drumming was the reason for The Ventures' slow paced and rather boring songs from 1960-63. This is why Walk Don't Run Vol. 2 is better than the first Walk Don't Run album. The first Walk Don't Run has some good heights like, Walk Don't Run, Night Train, and more, but Walk Don't Run Vol. 2 is absolutely a fabulous recording. The extraudinary Diamond Head appears on this album and so does the rockin' House of the Rising Sun and Walk Don't Run 64'. Some good rockin' hits like The Swingin Creeper, Peech Fuzz, Night Train, and Pedal Pusher also are included in this package. This album or albums are highlights of the Ventures' career and still remain a favorite of mine and yours."
4,Real Classics,"This collection starts off a bit slow, but builds big-time: 3 versions of Walk Don't Run, including a 70's discoesque edition, and some newer material near the end. Very mellow, pure surf nostalgia. Can't really go wrong with the Ventures."
1,this was disappointing,"I did expect a mathematical point of view on Tangrams in this book. Instead, the author sticks with tesselations (creating a mosaic like pattern) all over the book. He never goes into detail about the mathematical background. I was disappointed by this book that leads nowhere."
4,"Black Rider is an Uncomfortable Saddle, True . . .","Not an easy listen . . . loud and horrific and fragile and beautiful all at once . . . it has the madness and tendnerness of an e.e. cummings poem, had cummings gone the way of Poe. Not a fan of Burroughs, the album occasionally gets lost in its own self-conciousness, and is occasionally self-indulgent (read Waits' ""artistic"" liner notes) . . . but at its heart, it's just Waits, through and through, which deserves close to 5 stars, if not the whole. Songs like ""The Briar and the Rose"", ""Lucky Day"" and ""The Last Rose of Summer"" are harrowing little folk tunes (one intentionally reminiscent of the ol' tune ""Barbara Allen""), and ""Russian Dance"" is a gloriously sad instrumental, so aurally masterful, you can almost see a bunch of drunk serfs dancing their miseries away. A give-and-take album, but, as usual, you always get more than you expect from Waits. The many musicians give their heartfelt all. Worth the effort."
5,The best of the post-beat apocalypse,"It is easy, I guess, to miss the point. But maybe that is the point. Tom Waits is not easy to understand, and it's not just because of his gravelly voice. Here he is, as dark as he'll ever be, mixed in with William Borroughs, a writer who proves that hating humanity does not preclude humanity.If you've never heard Waits, maybe you should go get Rain Dogs, or Closing Time. They're both much easier introductions to Waits, they're full of songs which could be, and were, top-100 hits for other artists, like Rod Stewart, the Eagles.But this is Waits at his most powerful: surreal, dreamlike, maybe nightmarish, full of pathos and beauty, like a cold, foggy last night sent with a lover who is about to be put to death."
4,"It's Tom, not the original cast.","I love Tom Waits and was lucky enough to see the musical when it came from Germany to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The performance was chilling, engaging, and moving in every way. I bought this album thinking (hoping) it was the actual cast recording and was slightly disappointed to find out it isn't. Nevertheless, Waits does an excellent job on some wonderful tunes. I love to play it and reminisce about that performance. This is an essential album for the Waits die-hard. I am proud to own it and to have seen the production. I wish I had had the luck to see Frank's Wild Years in Chicago."
5,Long Time Fan's Favorite,"I've been a fan of Tom Waits, since I heard this very album a week or two after it was released. Now '93 may not seem like a long time to most, but at the risk of sounding melodramatic, the music Tom Waits' is able to create feels like I've known it my whole life. And of all his music, this is, in my humble opinion, his masterpiece. I've never understood when people say it's hard to listen to, I can sit and listen to this album, doing nothing else, and be completely entertained. I think people with a mind for theatre can grasp it better, the thought for me of being onstage to a Waits' score is, is...an unreachable dream. This is my favorite album of anyone, anywhere, and pound for pound I think it's one of the best collections of music ever produced."
3,Not so hard to get into after all,"I just want to make the comment that this cd isnt so hard to get into perhaps as some critics say. ""The black rider"" was the first Waits album I bought and the first time I heard his music. I have just bought my fourth Waits album so aparrantly it was a good start. But you have to realise of course that you are listening to a sort of experimental music. I wouldnt rate it as his best but it is still pretty nice with some rather weird songs."
5,I saw Black Rider and . . .,"it makes this album amazing and make sense. The show has only played in the US once (this past fall in San Francisco)-- so it is hard to see, but if you ever get the chance you should. It is really an amazing collaboration of three brilliant artists. Like any musical cast recording, the record is hard to understand the full story or make perfect sense of why the songs sound the way they do when you can't see the visual or hear the rest of the text. Because I did, I love the album. I can understand why you might not get into it if you haven't seen it, but I think approaching it like you would a sountrack to a musical is helpful.And just an FYI -- it's the story of Faust told in a crazy freak show kind of world. The hunting and the bullets comes in because the devil can give you 12 magic bullets that will always hit their target if you sell your soul. Plus it ties in in a creepy way to heroine and Burrough's (who wrote the text) shooting his wife."
3,Not a stellar performance from the master,"I have been a fan since Closing Time in 1973. I own all of his albums. In my humble opinion, this is the worst. Understand that Waits' at his worst is still pretty darn good, but if you're looking to add to your Waits collection - pass this one over. Pick up Heat Attack & Vine, Heart of Saturday Night, Small Change, Bone Machine, Frank's Wild Years - or any of his other works before this one. A couple really good songs - ""I'll Shoot the Moon"" and ""Lucky Day"". Otherwise, you feel like you're in Berlin in 1936 having your senses dulled and deadened."
3,Waits is at his most obtuse on this original opera score.,"The album is difficult to listen to, and probably rewarding on extensive study. This reviewer, however, was not able to get to that point. Waits is clearly talented, but this CD seems to have a very narrow audience, and Waits is writing only for them."
3,Disappointing!,I am a great Tom Waits fan and think Rain Dogs one of the best albums ever done by anyone. I was therefore very disappointed with this album because it is impossible to get into and enjoy even with persistence.
3,This movie/series is over rated.,This not in the same league as Le Carre adaptions by the BBC. This episode lacks any true drama in my view ; a tepid introduction. I think Reilly's life was far more exciting than this.
1,characters have no personality,"The characters of this script have no human nature. There is no portrayal of the inner emotions of the players in this drama. Only a surface telling of the tale without any developement of the personalities and interplay of relationships. If you want to see good espionage with personality try ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"""
1,Hated It,"This is one of the worst series I've ever watched. I couldn't even finish it. I'm a huge fan of Sam Neill, too, and I think he was just horrible in this series. Everybody (Bill Nighy, Joanne Whalley) was horrible. The music was awful, the acting & lines just laughable. No connection to the ""characters"" whatsoever. Unbelievably bad. I also finished ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" and thought it was excellent, even though I found the DVDs' glossary too late and didn't understand half of what was going on in TTSS. I'm apparently in the minority here with my 1-star review; to each her own."
4,Reilly Ace of Spies,"In December B. Harnden wrote a warning about buying the 4 video set expressing his disappointment that it did not include the first 2-hour segment which appeared on PBS. I have just had the same experience. Harnden indicated that he was going to order the ""first"" tape with the hope that it is the tape of the first segment. I wonder if he or anyone knows what the answer to this conundrum is. Like Harnden, I would like to see the whole series.John"
2,DIGITAL TRANSFER TO DVD COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I have enjoyed many of the episodes for some years now, and was eagerly awaiting the DVD version. Some episodes are obviously better than others in terms of production qaulity and substance. Overall, I was disappointed in the digital quality of the images. At times, the images and scenes was grainy and too dark. In some cases, the VHS actually provided a better-quality image."
5,Reilly Ace of Spies,"Enjoyed all twelve episodes very much, particularly the historical context. Acting and characterisations very good and had fun identifying the up-and-comers of British TV. Sadly, Albion once again is shown as perfidious. The additional clip on the real Reilly was a real surprise bonus."
5,British Spy Series at its best!,"If you are a fan of British spy and mystery series, this is a series for you. I found each of the mini-series very good except 1 of them which had a plot that was not as interesting as all the others. Nevertheless, one of the best overall British spy series. Think of this as the believable version of James Bond. There is some mature sexual content and graphic war scenes. The historical perspective of the world events during the early 1900's is interesting along with the human drama of life as a double agent and spy. Other British series we have enjoyed are Perot, Heat of the Sun, and Midsomer Murders."
5,"Reilly - Ace of Spies by Sam Neill, Peter Egan, Ian Charleson, Norman Rodway","Enjoyed would be understatement as I really became entangled with the actors & suspense with the main character, Sidney Reilly. Sam Neill seems to be someone who will be remembered for the roles he has played & will play in the future. Nowone is perfect,but this series I am sure, made many followers among the viewers. The main character was a factual person & it appears that the script followed closely the history concerning Reilly as he was a spy for Britain that 007 was patterned after.Well worth buying & viewing."
3,"Reilly, Ace of Spies","This review concerns itself with the four DVD set by Thames.The tonal qualities of the images throughout the entire series is very poor.To be more precise:1. In dark scenes, there is no detail in the shadows.2. In normal bright scenes, there is excessive flare, thus reducing the contrast and color saturation of the image. (Light from the bright areas impinges on the darker areas, thus reducing contrast. This is equivalent to raising the black level and reducing the contrast ratio).3. Image resolution is below par.This suggests that in the transfer process, gamma adjustment was wrong and, if this were an optical, rather than an electronic transfer, the optics caused the flare.BBC / Thames should be thoroughly ashamed of the slipshod job they did on an otherwise excellent film. Let us hope they remedy this situation and do justice to this most interesting and well acted and staged series.The sound is excellent and all the dialog is crisp and clear."
3,"Reilly, Ace of Spies VHS","The story as seen on TV is excellent as is the music, casting, acting and direction. The TV series rates 5 stars. The VHS casettes do not duplicate this high quality. The quality of the video tape is not good in 2 instances: The audio of the volume titled, ""Affair With a Married Woman"" (which should be labeled as ""Volume 1"" since it is the actual beginning of the story) is quite poor; very noisy, ""jumpy"", and in general quite annoying. Volume 4 is incomplete in that it does not contain the complete last episode as seen on TV. The last episode of the TV series includes Reilly's death, Volume 4 does not."
5,Super Spy!,"Reilly, Ace of Spies is a super series! I enjoyed it tremendously when it first aired on public television many years ago and it is just as good now. Sam Neill is a fantastic actor and really becomes Reilly. The series is full of intrigue and suspense. Definitely worth watching!"
5,A real spy story,"Saw this TV series in the UK eons ago. Always wanted to see it again.This series has depth, inuendo. One has to pay attention to what is going on or you miss a key point.Glad this and similar series are now available on Amazon."
5,"REILLY, ACE OF SPIES","Much entertaining, I remember this TV series from my childhood and it has been great watching them once again.Well done, well shot in period and excellent cast."
5,just as wonderful as the first time around,I loved this series when it first came out. Sam Neil is amazing. It was the first time I ever saw him. this is as exciting and well directed as I remember it. If you love espionage and suspense this is your series. You will not be disappointed
4,Reilly - Ace of Spies,"The content of this DVD set has been described by others, so all I have to add is that I enjoyed it immensely. I intended to watch the 10 episodes plus the 30 min biography over 5 nights at 2 episodes a night. Instead I watched over 3 nights and was disappointed when it was over. I will be watching the whole thing again in perhaps another month or so.Perhaps the one episode where a British spy (not Reilly) is discovered in the German docks is a little weaker than the rest; it is also apparent from the biography that some episodes are severely artistically licensed. Nevertheless, for anyone who enjoys historical dramas made as only the Brits can this set is all around good value, great fun and time spent well entertained. Sam Neill fans can only be delighted."
5,"Fabulous, Just Fabulous","If this Prelude a L'Apres-Midi D'un Faune does not melt your heart, I'm not sure what version will.The whole CD is an incredibly well recorded and played rendition of DeBussy's finest creations. Just think, for just $0.02 and up you could have as fine or better collection of these classics than the comparable ""big name"" versions.The sound is crystal clear. LaserLight you have done it again!Yes, the La Mer is VERY quiet in the beginning. It would help to don a pair of headphones when listening to this disc. I guarantee the reader the magic and detail of this recording will only then come ALIVE!Highly recommended, very underrated disc."
2,Recording Not Up to Snuff,"Debussy has long been one of my favorite composers. ""La Mer"" is a fantastic portrayal of the sea and it was with great anticipation I ordered this CD, However, I am greatly disappointed in the actual recording. It is impossible to listen to in comfort without constantly lowering and raising the sound level. One minute, the music is so low, it cannot be heard. The next, a loud burst of music jolts and startles one. It is a pity, to have beautiful music such as this spoiled by poor sound engineering."
1,cheap,I bought this as a gift for my mother. We liked it at first until she wore it for a while. It turned her finger green. Very disappointing.
4,They don't seem too interested.,"This double LP was originally released in the mid-'70s to capitalize on the success of the Beach Boys compilationEndless Summer. In fact, there are five cover versions of Beach Boys songs here. Most of the songs are either about surfing or cars. Dean, who compiled the album, managed to sneak in a couple of his solo recordings, with ""Vegetables"" and ""Sunshine Music"". Those two tracks don't really fit the ""theme"" of the rest of the album. Anyway, this is a fun album that features not only hits, but also fun album tracks like ""Schlock Rod"" and ""Bucket T"". And it's in mono."
1,"Mistitled!!! Should be ""the MONO collection""!!!","I used to have the original stereo United Artists ""Gotta Take That One Last Ride"" on 8-track and it sounded MUCH better than this. Unfortunately, some[one] decided to compile EVERY single track in MONO and use the same track listing for this CD. If you're a mono purist, this is definately the CD for you. However, if you want to hear Jan and Dean in true stereo like the original Liberty records, I would whole-heartedly recommond avoid buying products from One Way Records. If they ever heard of more than One Way, maybe they wouldn't have chosen the Wrong Way!"
4,It does its job,"I got this to take advantage of the shorter wheelbase of a tractor to move a 28-foot gooseneck stock trailer in and out of an equipment shed. It does exactly what I want it to do. However, the tractor has a fiberglass canopy, and the forward dome of the stock trailer contacts the canopy if any turns over, say, 45 degrees are made. Thus I lose some of the maneuver advantage of the tractor. Failing to watch for this contact would result in damage to the trailer or to the canopy"
5,Fascinating,"Alfred Crosby's ""Ecological Imperialism"" is a provocative, well-written and definitely fascinating book. Crosby examines the reason Europeans were able to defeat the Indigenous people in American, Australia and New Zealand. Crosby argues that the biology and ecology factors played tremendous roles in their win. Crosy argues that the weeds, animals and the Europeans best allies, the germs or diseases that they brought with them to the New World dominated the Indigenous people. The Europeans sought to make the New World as similiar to that of the Old World. It was interesting for me because we were taught that the military superiority of the Europeans was the main factor. In addition, Crosy also examines the unsuccessful attempts of the Europeans at dominating Asia and Africa.""Ecological Imperialism"" definitely is a groundbreaking book in the field of environmental history."
5,Dazzling,"Alfred Crosby is one of the few historians who have changed the way people think. Back in the 1960s he got the crazy idea that the *biological* expansion of Europe into the rest of the world was the real story of the last few centuries. His book, The Columbian Exchange -- Europe sent over people and germs and got back the biological wealth of the Americas -- was rejected by a dozen publishers. This book is a restating and resharpening and amplification of this thesis, which by now is so well accepted in its basics that I was amused to see some of the Amazon reviewers say there was not that much new here. In a way, I guess they're right, but this book is nonetheless full of wonderful historical connections -- why smallpox caused the slave trade, why corn changed the history of Eastern Europe -- that you would never think of otherwise. I would also want to single out Crosby's writing, which is dryly humorous and even moving on occasion. Altogether amazing stuff, this book."
3,A fine start!,"Swan Dive was still trying to find their sound here, so we get everything from country pop to U2-esque soundscapes to swing, including a couple of really lovely, lush ballads. Don't order the Japanese import, however. You can get it much cheaper from Swan Dive themselves as their web site!"
3,Slow and Old,"I get the vast terrain of the west, so enough with the panning. I want to see Hopi pottery. The music will put you into a trance in which I hope you can keep your eyelids open long enough to make it to the pottery. After some fast forwarding, finally pottery! Some nice examples. Gives dates and glazing technique such as polychrome, black on white, etc. Then the film goes into detailed history. Like this part."
4,Scraper,Used for scraping the registration sticker from the windshield. The hold down screw stick up a litter to far and get in the way.
4,Cheap and effective,"These are great to have around the house or garage for a variety of uses. I commonly use them to clean up cabling in various situations, from AV gear in the home to wired sensors on a bicycle. In a pinch, they serve as a good fasteners for other more complex fix up jobs as well - I have kept the larger ones in the trunk of the car for unanticipated emergencies, and found that I used them three or four times out of convenience.This ties in this set are only 4"" in length, so just keep that in mind that it's for small jobs."
1,an irreconcilable claim,"One can only wonder at the claim ""'Simon,' a descendant of Spain's medieval Marranos who submitted to baptism to escape the Inquisition,..."" Since only baptized Christians were subject to the Inquisition, one is hard-pressed to imagine how being baptized would constitute an ""escape"" from the Inquisition, itelf greatly exaggerated as the Black Legend."
3,Academic uses?,"As an English professor with a specialty in contemporary Nigerian theatre, I am perpetually pleased to have this dictionary and perpetually disappointed by its limitations. I studied the language for two years, so my basic grammar and vocabulary skills are fine (and the well written grammar section of this dictionary is a useful reference if something slips). The dictionary is geared toward the sciences and lacks any technical theatrical, anthropological, artistic, or aesthetic terms. That being said, I have yet to locate anything better on the market."
3,Incomplete reference,"Too many english->yoruba words and few youruba->english words. A lot of words missing. It is not bad, but, incomplete. A lot of pages, but..."
3,"Interesting, but not Shockabilly's best","A must for collectors of Shockabilly stuff, but as an intro, or as a representation of their best work, Heaven is probably much more appropriate. Get the Vietnam/Heaven CD and you can't go wrong."
5,"Excellent research, painful truths","for those who don't know George Barna, google ""The Barna Group"" They do extensive polling of Christian opinion. So this book is much more than one man's opinions, it has valuable statistics like, ""effective churches have at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted worship music."" To me the most interesting part of this book is Barna's finding that only 10-15% of churches are truly effective, and even in these it happens more by accident than design."
5,A must if your serious about permanently losing weight,"A co-worker lent me this CD and after listening once, I immediately went out and purchased my own. This is a training session for the mind, and if you don't think you have to train your mind while your training your body (trying to lose weight), then think again. There is vital information coupled with a series of affirmations that actually change the way you think about your body, about diets, and about exercise. It made a huge positive difference in my program."
2,Only wish it worked!,"It would be lovely to play this audiocassette and achieve weight loss ""automatically"". But as most of us know it doesnt work like that in the real world. The cassette is ok to listen to, but has a few problems. Its designed to be used in the car and the authors state this. However, their voices are so relaxing I found myself having trouble staying awake when I used the cassette. Secondly, its obvious they are very happy with each other and they indicate this with comments to one another that really detract from the point of the cassette. The premise of the cassette is that feeling good about yourself will help you lose weight and once you feel good about yourself the weight will come off ""automatically"" but then they go on to recommend a 40/30/30 diet! Thus the message of the cassette isnt quite what its supposed to be."
2,Not what I thought....,The CD is split up into a few parts instead of being continuous. A little inconvenient while driving. The information was so basic almost boring.
4,A Very Practical Dictionary,"This Larousse Dictionnaire des Synonymes is very practical and convenientas a complementary tool to the Nouveau Petit Robert. I've enjoyed using itas an addition to the main language dictionaries.Helene Cardona, author of The Astonished Universe"
1,This book is somewhat boring and a litte confusing.,I read the book Angels Without Wings by Jane Yarmolinski.It is about a family who struggles in a time of family crisis. I did not like this book. It was confusing and somewhat boring. I would not suggest this book to young readers.
3,Not really needed,"A good affordable digital multimeter under $10 will do the same job ,even better at troubleshooting a bad alt/battery,but all in all a decent tool for a quick check."
4,needed a few more Instructions,"this is a handy product,it show's what is going on with your battery's and the altenater in the charging system. you know if you need battery's or a altenator."
2,too much for a disco light,"the leds would only display as a group indicating the peak voltage rather than display only the measured volt, the ground probe should be a clip rather than a pin probe. Too expensive for its function."
4,Everyone has their opinions,I actually like this and can watch it over and over.I would rent it first though if you haven't seen it before.
5,Side splitting,"Beware, you may fall out of your chair and damage yourself laughing. One of the funniest physical humor movies ever made. Long live Mr. Bean and Rowan Atkinson!"
4,Funny movie for the family,This movie plays off the many moods and antics of this classic comedian. It may not be as funny as his first movie but its pretty good!
4,Funny movie,This is a funny movie. Still like the newest one (Mr Bean on Holiday) better than this one.
1,BEAN: *1/2,"I gave Bean *1/2 stars because, even though I'm a fan of the TV show that this movie was NOT funny. What happened to the character of Mr. Bean? This looked good but it was so so so so so so so so so so so so disappointing."
1,painfully lame,"This convoluted, charmless movie completely misses the point of what made the Mr. Bean series so appealing. Instead of a movie about the titular character this is in fact a movie about a verbose, whiny American (played by Peter MacNicol in a performance that redefines annoying) being baffled by Mr. Bean who ends up becoming a supporting character in his own movie. Not to mention this is one of the ugliest films in terms of cinematography and production design I have ever seen. The original had a flat British TV look which actually enhanced the comedy, but this movie looks like a cheap, tacky teen movie from the late 80's or early 90's. It takes something that was simple and witty and turns it into a vulgar mess. Avoid at all costs."
1,Mr Bean goes Hollywood? What a shame.,"I am a big fan of Mr Bean, I have seen him on TV for many many years. After seeing this film, I relized that Mr Bean should remain just on TV. However, I don't blame Rowan Atkinson for this mess, he will still be one of my most favorite comedians. It must be silly that someone is trying to give Mr Bean a Hero's role, We should all know that Mr Bean is a perfect loser, all he deserves is always failure. Hollywood is bringing my man down, Help! Anyway, salute to Rowan Atkinson, he's the best, but this film is just a waste of his time and resources."
1,"At best, this movie is boring...","I adore British comedies. I love Mr. Bean, the british comedy series. I am huge fan of Rowan Atkinson. However, this movie was absolutely a waste of time. It was so boring it was painful. There was no actual comedy. I never even cracked a smile. It was simply stupid. And, this from a man who loves Douglas Adams and Dave Barry.Put the money towards Mr. Bean, the complete series. Now, that's a comedy classic in the tradition of Jerry Lewis and (great) Jim Carrey. But, pass on this movie..."
1,Where's the laughs?,"I bought this DVD after seeing Mr. Bean's Vacation in movie theater, thinking that it would be as funny as the current offering, and I did not laugh once. I have not seen Mr. Bean the TV show, but this movie feels like any other 5 minute sketch stretched into an hour and half movie. When on think of ""English Humor"", subtleties, irony and wryness come to mind, but in this movie the gags were predictable and more cringe-inducing than funny, or simply gross. At places Mr. Bean's behaviors were more in tune with a sociopathic retard than a lovable misfit. The entire hospital scene felt tacked on to pad the playing time. And as if the plot was not thin enough, they diluted it further with the added family drama of the Langleys. There's another 15 minutes they could've cut out."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The TV show is more funnier than the movie. Man, I can't beleive I wasted my money for this movie when I saw it in theater, the movie's cheesy. Don't even plan on renting it or buying it."
3,Not as funny as i used to remember watching Bean,"I used to and still do love to watch Bean. When the show came on it was truly very funny and loved every moment of it. However, as the show went off and now a movie was made, i found that it just wasnt the same..it tried, but, it truly failed in story and with same old, same old funny acts that Bean did on his show (which were funny, but, geeees..how many times can you really watch it until it gets dull?). The movie was ok, but, i thought it could have done a lot better..this is only a rent first then buy."
5,Great Humor for the whole family,"I have no idea why this is pg 13... The only piece that was a bit on the edge was a hand gesture near the end. The movie is great. My kids 12-7 loved it. It's a bit on the low budget side, but the humor is top shelf."
3,Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie,"Be afraid, be very afraid, Mr. Bean has a passport. I saw this movie in theatres, and I asked myself the same thing you're probably thinking - does Mr. Bean hold up as a movie? Well, yes and no. The premise of Bean being sent to the U.S. to oversee the unveiling of Whistler's Mother just so his co-workers could get rid of him was a great plot for a feature-length film.However, the director, Mel Smith went for a lot of old material; popping the barf bag on the plane and so forth. So, yes it does work as a movie, but get ready for some familiar gags from the TV series."
3,An average comedy,Im a big rowan atkinson fan but this movie didnt impress me. Still there were a few funny parts that i still laugh about but not enough to want to buy it.
5,"MAKE YOU LAUGH, UNTIL YOU VOMIT",THIS IS A GREAT COMEDY MOVIE. THE TV SERIES IS ALSO GREAT TO. I SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GET IT.
2,Disappointed,"I'm a big bean fan, and went to see the movie expecting the REAL Bean. However, the american movie makers ruined the movie by adding uncharacteristic features and persona into the movie making it un-funny. Thumbs down."
4,Call it 3 1/2 stars just to be fair.,"There are two schools of thought on British Humor. You like it or you hate it. Period. I've always been a fan of Rowan Atkinson, not only for the Mr. Bean Character but also for the Black Adder series.Bean is simply a goofy British nerd. Doesn't have too many friends, isn't particularly smart, and kind of goes through life pretty well oblivious to everything around him. In this film he's mistaken for an Art Expert for a museum travelling to LA. The plot isn't much and never is.Everything is about the Chaos Bean brings to everything he does. Not as good as the TV series, but I don't think Bean fans will be disappointed.If you're not a Bean fan...avoid it at all costs.Being that self-absorbed gets him into one mess after another."
4,"MAKES YOU CHUCKLE, BUT NO BIG LAUGHS",Not exactly as funny as I thaught it would be. Not nearly as funny as the dummy in the TV show. My favouate scene was where Mr. Bean is driving around waving his middle finger because he thinks it means hello.
3,Should Have Been a 5,"This is a 4 star movie for anyone who has never seen Mr. Bean before. As someone who has the box set and had watched Bean on PBS for many years, this movie just didn't cut it for me. It is basically a reworking of all the very best bits of Rowan from the Bean series with a movie plot around them tying them together. So while there is a new idea or two, for the most part the long term fan has seen all these gags before. I would pick up the Whole Box of Beans to get a true taste of the genius of Rowan Atkinson."
4,even little children like this one,"My two year old just can't get enough of this movie .... we watch it daily! Although I am getting weary of seeing the movie, it is still funny as Mr. - make that Dr. - Bean comes to America to enlighten us about Whistler's Mother (a hideous old cow with a cactus lodged up her backside). If you like the short skits from the PBS shows, you will like this movie too (even if you see it everyday)."
2,not his best work,"Mr bean is generally a 3-4 star event in our household, but this is simply a lesser performance of his."
3,"Bean there, done that","If you've never before experienced the comic brilliance of Rowan Atkinson, then this movie ain't a bad place to start; but if you've already seen every episode of the Mr.Bean tv series, then you're bound to be a little disappointed with the 'Americanization' of the character. There are enough new gags here to make it definitely worth seeing once, but there are also many recycled jokes from the series, and they just don't work as well here. Here's hoping a sequel takes Bean back to England where he belongs."
2,not like the TV show,I was very disappointed by this movie. It's not at all like the TV show. Might make an OK kids movie but if you rent this expecting it to be as funny as the TV show you will be very disappointed.
2,Refried Beans,Bean usually means funny - but not in this case. Mr Bean has unfortunately lost his way in this movie and is definitely off the laughter lane. Lets hope for better serving of beans next time !
2,"A butcher, not a barber! Okay, that an overstatement.","This just won't do! These aren't that bad of performances - the notes are mostly in the right places, they move along at a steady pace, and the sound is adequate. It's just that they lack the joy and brio found in so many other recordings. Except for the extremely low price, far better accounts are available - especially those by Toscanini (even with less than ideal sonics), Giulini (wonderful cantabile), and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra (full of energy). I don't know the versions by Reiner or Marriner, but I know they are considered to be among the best. So unless you're collecting the entire ""Passion"" series or get this CD in the complete set (like me), you can safely pass this one by."
3,Not nearly as good as Qntal VI.,"Having enjoyed Qntal VI: Translucida, I decided to give Qntal III: Tristan Und Isolde a spin. I'm not so crazy about it... too many uptempo songs, and lots of instrumentals that remind me of a Renaissance Faire. The vocals are lovely as usual -- I just wish this music had more of them."
4,BOOM BOOM,"JOHN LEE HOOKER RECORDED SO MUCH GREAT MUSIC IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHICH SONGS SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON A ""BEST OF"" COMPILATION, BUT THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME GLARING OMMISSIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE IS ""ONE BOURBON, ONE SCOTCH, ONE BEER"" , ONE OF HIS BIGGEST HITS, ON THIS ""BEST OF"" COLLECTION?). THAT'S OKAY, IT'S GOT A NICE MIX OF JOHN LEE DOING BOTH ELECTRIC AND ACOUSTIC SONGS, AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT. IF YOU LIKE JOHN LEE HOOKER, YOU WILL LIKE THIS CD"
1,Wrong specs,"The specs are 18x 18 x 22.5It is not 24"" tall.Truthful information about a product is paramount!Because of this I doubt I will ever buy anything from them again..."
4,Love the tea tables,"Love the table....easy to put together, works nicely with my modern sofa, feet of table slips under sofa bringing the table top near you. Great for eating dinner, working on computer or just hlding the remote and tv guide.Arrived quickly, 15 minutes to assemble."
3,sofa table,"This item filled my needs and was delivered quite promptly. It's metal frame was made from cheap aluminum, but for the price it was as expected."
2,A BIG disappointment,"I thought this pan would be multi-purpose. It is not.It is also very ""tinny"" and not so well made.Save your money and get a adonized pan instead."
4,good,this is a good cd but lacks effort even though nelly is a good artist he came up off two singles and a lot of tv time i would like more effort especially with his original style
2,Bizarre and Unusual...,"This book was a doozy to read. It reads like it's written by a twelve year old and was given to the publisher in its unedited form. I have no doubt that Vianna is a compassionate and accomplished healer, but her methodology leaves me boggled. Better to attend the workshop I think. I tried the techniques of rising up above my body and entering the crown chakra of my 'patient' and visualising the sick areas of their body and extracting the programs from the DNA.However I think I need more practice. And whatever you do, be careful with the medical advice she gives. Some of it is doubtful and poorly researched. Including extracting metal government implants from people. Chances are they are pins in previous fractures, not bugging devices.Not an easy modality to master by reading her book. I think you need to be born gifted to heal in this manner.Bless, Vianna."
4,It was pretty good,I think it was pretty good because shows people what it's like to have be look different or act different.
4,Hot Shot Split Shot,"Is there such a thing as hot shot split shot?Not sure. But, it does rhyme...And, this product is very good at doing what split shot is supposed to do - sink your nymph into the strike zone to bag that elusive trout.The shot is football shaped. This helps orient it on the tippet for quick attaching. There's a dimple to locate the prong of your forceps to open the shot for easy removal. And the dispenser reliably measures it out one by one.BB size (a full range of others is available) is the one I use the most.I recommend it."
5,Revenge at its best,"Some say revenge is a dish best served cold, but Dan enjoys serving up his revenge in funny, cruel and riveting ways. This DvD is definately worth the price"
4,In the Company of Lesser-Known Characters,"I was drawn to this book because it contains the author's ""The Poor Widow in Mark and Her Poor Rich Readers,"" cited in more-recent commentaries on Mark 12. This chapter, one of the suthor's seven academic articles gathered to make up the present volume, expands the usual reading of the text and develops six different narrative contexts in which we can view it.A creative, in-depth study of less-frequently-examined corners of the earliest Gospel, with an introductory chapter on narrative criticism, followed by chapters on ""Fallible Followers,"" ""Disciples/Crowds/Whoever,"" ""Interpreting the Disciples in Mark, ""Jewish Leaders in the Gospel of Mark,"" and ""The Major Importance of Minor Characters in Mark."""
2,different from what i expected...,"this book was not what i expected. it may be a very good book for those who cook or intend to cook 3 meals a day. But when i bought this book, i thought it was about making a full balanced meal at one time. this book is set up a bit differently. it gives instructions to prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner all at once. the breakfast needs some bit of dinner leftovers, the dinner requires some part of lunch leftovers and the lunch needs some ingredient from the breakfast. So in order to make one meal, you have to make all 3 meals. so if you just want to come home and cook a single meal of dinner, then this book is not for that."
3,"The Book of Whole Meals; A Seasonal Guide to Assembling Balanced Vegetarian Breakfasts, Lunches and Dinners","It's so - so. I didn't think it was that fantastic -- at least not as great as one of my friends who owned a copy raved about it. But, then again, she's not a vegetarian either. I'm not a vegetarian either, but am a Vegan which means I eat a much more restrictive diet and try to stay away from soy products because they block digestion of such things as Iodine."
1,Questionable quality,"Bought this based on the brand name I had a lot of respect and admiration for ALL Schumacher products little did I know until I made the mistake of buying this cord TOGTHER with SAC 101 (Dual Socket) and SAC 103 (Socket) Very poor quality and materials all the way through, for example the female socket wirng was not even soldered on Sac 102! sad to say but a complete waste of money defintely my mayor buying blunder here at Amazon."
3,"Feels unsafe, heats up quite a bit","Ordered with the purpose of extending the DC cord from my portable electric cooler. After two days the female end housing had cracked but was still operational. I don't the think the gauge of the wire is thick enough because it heats up alot, to the point where it's uncomfortable to touch. I think I'll be looking for something a little more heavy-duty."
5,Every thing from ordering to getting went Very Good,"Have not done any thing with things .But Very Pleased with how every thing from me ordering , to me get this dvd went very good."
4,HEAVY DUTY GRIND - BLAST THOSE SPEAKERS,"Contains a few members from EXTREME NOISE TERROR on the same level as ENT's ""BEING AND NOTHING"". If you bashed your head with that album, you probably will with this one. Also on CANDLE LIGHT RECORDS."
2,Wanted to love them...,"Very attractive shoes - the perfect warm, rich brown with the flirty cross buckle; I though they'd be wonderful casual work shoes. Unfortunately, the rise comes to far up on the top of the shoe for comfort or style. It cuts into the middle part of the foot (painfully if you try to do a whole day with them) and the high cut makes my foot look even wider/longer than typical. I love walking cradle, but this higher cut on the top of the foot just does not work."
3,"Not as wide as needed, inside edges rough",These shoes will be going back as they weren't as wide as other Walking Cradles in WW width that i have bought before. Also the inside edges are pretty rough. I'm not sure if this is because they were too tight but i think it would still be rough even if they fit.
1,Terrible,This scattered and incoherent film never builds any empathy or interest in the characters that populate it. Cinematography is darkly beautiful. I defy anyone to get all the way to the end of this film in one sitting.
1,David Lynch Fan,"I started with Eraserhead many, many years ago, & have been a loyal Lynch fan. Every genius creates at least one piece of art that is not very good. This is the one. No matter what he does, I'm going to watch it, but once was enough for this movie. I watch repeats of everything else he has done, but this one.If you dont' get it I will tell you, so stop reading here. The main character is crazy, & you are seeing the movie from his viewpoint."
2,A wee tad bit TOO abstract...,"Whereas I appreciated the abstract, progressive filmmaking of ""Mulholland Drive,"" this movie was so abstract that it took the jump from progressive to ambaguous (yes, that's a word). In fact, I discovered, upon viewing this film, that it is actually possible to spontaneously combust from confusion. To make things worse, I made the mistake of taking a lovely young lady on a first date to see this movie (needless to say, we didn't date very long after that). Patricia Arquette's well-proportioned jumblies are the only two things I found remotely fascinating about this turd."
5,Great Film,"If you are locked into watching only films that give you the satisfaction of ""getting it"" - don't bother. There are many reviews in this listing that say I watched it - I didn't get it - it's bad. But I have not seen a review in which the viewer claimed to have turned off the film in the middle and returned it to the store. It is an absorbing film. Sometimes, it is good to experience things that you do not understand."
3,Where's the Cliff Notes?,"I'm a big fan of David Lynch's other work and I wish I could tell you I loved this movie. Lynch's minimalist style leaves you wondering what's going on and where things are headed. This makes for some unbelievable tension that keeps you glued to the screen wanting to know what's next. He keeps you guessing and usually wraps things up at the end by bringing light to the confusion and exposing the manipulation. I love his technique...it's a roller coaster ride! However, at the end of Lost Highway I was more confused than ever. If you love David Lynch...you'll love this movie right up until you're left with the credits and too many unanswered questions. If you've never watched a David Lynch movie, don't start with this one."
4,Lost Highway,"I am a big David Lynch fan, and this was worth waiting for. To David Lynch, if you are reading this please, please keep up the good work. There are many ways to explore art, and yours covers all the areas both on the surface and below, most other movies are shallow but yours pass from the surface into the inner contiousness with ease."
4,One of Lynch's Best,"Definitely one of Lynch's best films. Much better than Wild At Heart or Fire Walk With Me or Dune, I think. Not quite equal to Blue Velvet or Eraserhead, but pretty close. Unlike Lynch's ""failures,"" this film isn't dominated by scenes that stand alone, superior to the film as a whole. The whole thing comes together in an inventive structure that is as integral to the work and as interesting as certain stand-out individual scenes. The biggest criticisms leveled at Lost Highway have been aimed at the seemingly incomprehensible narrative, but the same criticism can be leveled at, for example, the literary works of James Joyce. Why are films held to a different standard than literature? I don't know, but it is a key to why film critics in general are some of the dimmest, least perceptive people out there. My only question is why the heck isn't this thing on DVD by now? What a shame!"
2,New Lost Highway DVD sucks.,"Why doesn't anyone ever actually review the DVD's and not just the movie in these reviews?I love David Lynch. I follow his work religiously and I absolutely love this film. I've been awaiting an actual DVD release of this for years. Now that it's here, I can't help but feel gypped by him and Universal for putting out this piece of crap disc.I'm very happy that the film at least got a DVD release. It looks amazing, and it's in widescreen, no complaints there. However, there's absolutley no extras on this disc. NOTHING. Not even a trailer. Why is it that the UK edition comes with 2 discs with extras? Why couldn't they just have made an NTSC copy of that? WHY? SOMEONE TELL ME. RIGHT NOW.I should have just stuck with my VHS copy. Not like I would have been missing out on much by not purchasing this."
3,Wait for the American release !,"The movie is Perfect ! there is no doubt about it, but the video in the Canadian version [is bad]! the VHS version is better in this matter, the audio is OK, the lack of special features is depresive, there's no caption or subtitles in any language wich helps in the beginning when the caracters wisper all the time. I suggest you contain your craves and wait for the american release, it's always better."
5,The lost bastards.,"This movie is the movie of an alternative hell. Every characters is veild under the spell of bad man wearing lipstick and mascara. But that is to tell too much. In this film you sense the absence of good, therefore evil blends and becomes just frightening. David Lynch is done whit evil now. He has disspelled it, and thereby became it's master. I don't think he will ever make an evil movie again...Or will he?"
3,Insensatez,"What starts out as a jazz musician and his wife being sent perverted video copies of them and their house turns into husband murders wife and is sent to prison but transforms into an auto mechanic. The story then follows the auto mechanic as he falls for gangster's girlfriend and they struggle to get away from him when he finds out. Manages to shock and entertain throughout most of the movie without too many difficulties but falls completely apart from the murdering/robbing Andy scene to the end. Given imperfections, this movie is still spellbinding."
2,"David Lynch, grow up!","Loved Blue Velvet, hated Lost Highway. What a disappointment. It had a great cast which was largely wasted on David Lynch's personal apprehensions and fetishes. Like Scorsese and Kubrick, Lynch is a painterly director, and has always had great visual and aural sensibilities. But here he is indulging in some sort of dopey Betty Page noir fantasy, where women, in the 90s, wear high heels with their bathrobes, and basically have no personality. The dialogue was awful. I knew it was bad when I was more interested in the color of nail polish Patricia Arquette was wearing than in what she was saying. David Lynch has taken German expressionist angst, kept the anger part for its sensationalist value, and lowered the whole gestalt of German expressionism to suit his own more shallow, banal vision. He has a tiresome need to indulge in some part of his adolescence, from which he, apparently, can not get unstuck."
2,Lynch's movies are hard to watch,"Since i am not a typical lynch fan, i find it hard to watch some of his movies. the first thing that i saw by lynch was the tv series twin peaks, and honestly i hated it because ididn't understand anything that went on. now i have wached fire walk with me and i loved that movie. so now i am going to watch twin peaks again and try to tolerate it. i am not promising anything? then maybe i wil watch lost highway and blue velvet again and actually have compassion for it, doubt it but it will be worth the try. TO ALL YOU LYNCH FANS I APPLAUD YOU FOR HAVING THE MIND COMPACITY FOR HIS MOVIES."
2,Eh.,"Since everyone else is saying this, I'll say it too. ""If you're a fan of David Lynch, you'll love this movie."" But I don't esee how anyone could appreciate this incomprehensible work. Starts off interstingly enough, but as soon as Pullman changes identities for no reason whatsoever, the film falls apart into nothing more than an excercise in confusion. And it's confusing because the plot is non-existant.Now don't get me wrong, I like offbeat films. I liked Tetsuo and Tetsuo II. Things don't need to be explained to me point-blank for me to like a movie. But I do like having something to base my opinions on, and as soon as I thought I had something to stand on in Lost Highway the floor fell out from below me. Gets 2 stars because Lynch was actually able to get this film made, even though it really shouldn't have. Congratulations to him in that respect.Lost Highway reminds me of a film-school student's shallow attempt at being ""deep"". Ho hum."
2,this film bored me,"The photography is above average, there are many shots with strange camera angles. However, the story itself seems to have no turning point and no resolution, Lost Highway is pretty much like some kind of dream you have in the morning just before you wake up, it's irrational, unexplainable and can't really be remembered."
1,Totally Devoid of Anything That Makes Sense,"I don't get it - people are supposed to say that this is good because it doesn't make sense; this is good because it's stupid, etc. I don't get it.I saw this movie three times. The second and third time didn't give me anything to grab onto, There was not the proverbial - ""Oh yeah, I missed that before"", or ""Oh yeah it makes sense now"". It was just, ""Oh yeah like yeah, okay, Like the lights are on but the drapes are drawn"" kinda sh-t. Even the mystery man (Robert Blake) was embarrassed about his role on this movie. I think the movie's okay for those who like this kind of movie but I never got off on movies that didn't make sense. I liked his other movie about the elephant man and R Crumb - those were awesome. Good soundtrack on this Lost Highway too. But for the movie, geezz - there's nothing wrong with surrealiem in film but this one is assinine."
3,LOST,"I hate to say it, but I was a bit disappointed with the movie simply because the movie was just too hard to follow. While watching the film I was thinking about Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" movie because like ""The Wall"", ""Lost Highway"" made no sense to me whatsoever. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because it had one of my favorite actresses in it (Patricia Arquette) with plenty of hot scenes with her. It also featured my favorite hard rock/metal band ""Rammstein"". I'll have to say the movie lived up to its name for I was LOST throughout it."
2,"Not ""the worst move ever"", however...","I really enjoy these kind of films and thought the flick was decent at best. Some people I have talked to swear this movie was simply amazing.I had a hard time sitting in my chair the entire length of the film, I really hate ending movies early and always like to finish them so I did.The movie tells the story in a way that you have to really pay attention to, everything seems random while most scenes are very deliberate. Leaves ya to really do some figuring out on your own.All in all I somewhat enjoyed it, I will probably never watch it again, nor will I recommend it to anyone."
3,ANOTHER SURREALIST FILM MADE BY DIRECTOR DAVID LYNCH.,"*** 1/2 stars rating for ""Lost Highway"". The movie presents a lot of David Lynch's trademarks: dark environments, inexplicable situations, sexually obsessed characters and a non-linear story.Always is interesting to see a movie made by the experimental director David Lynch, so ""Lost Highway"" has interesting parts, however, sometimes it gives the sensation that the only person in the world that is pleased with the events that appear on the screen is David Lynch, and that is a bad thing because the movie fans are the main reason why the movies are made. It's good to be creative, but you got to show a plot once in a while.But putting that aside, ""Lost Highway"" is an interesting exercise of film experimentation. The highlight may be Robert Blake as ""The Mystery Man"", he is really a creepy character."
5,onrop,m manson are hot in this movie in the scene where every one is watching a onrop that gets 5 stars alone plus the road rage scene where the old man beats the butt nugget driver very cool
2,Fun for the whole family.,Some guy meets the devil at a party and trades his soul for the ability to go bowling while being locked up in jail for murdering his wife.
1,i wish i could give minus stars!,"This would have to be one of the worst movies i have had the displeasure of watching. For one the story has no .... logical explanation. the writer does not explain any of the weird occurances to the audience, we're just supposed to accept that Bull Pullman just swaps bodies with that guy. I know its a movie, but even the most far fetched story line has to make some explanation to the audience. Then, the dialogue i find is boring, and does not help develop the characters, i think the script would probably be be about two pages long. The cinematically, every1 praises it, but i think it jsut tries too hard in that department to do these 'artsy' shots. Overall I really hated this movie. Although it did have a killer soundtrack, feat NIN and marilyn manson, and i did like marilyn's little cameo appearance in that porno."
1,terrible flick,the most ridiculous movie ever made do not waste your money to buy this film. it made no sense. i wish i can return it.
1,Lost Highway,"Lost movienotably the worst movie I have ever been forced to watch!!!!!We were in a new home with no cable service and waiting for satellite service when this film arrived after ten minutes I left the room, but had no place to go so, yep I watched the whole thing and I dare to say I am probably the very first person to do so ever and I may well be the only person to ever watch the whole thing this movie had more flash backs than a mountain road and none of the made any sense stay away."
5,One of the greatest movies of all time,"I think that the other reviewer below, Patrick B. Dandenault, was completely right in his guess of the story. The later part of the movie is imagination of Fred while he sits in his cell waiting for his execution. The screaming and smoke in the car at the very end of the movie when Fred is escaping police chase actually represent the execution at the electricity chair.This is a true masterpiece. Just don't try to understand everything and let it go. Lynch's movies are conceived and interpreted at a subconcious level.The closest masterpieces are ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me"" (however makes sense only if you watched Twin Peaks) and ""Fight Club"" (by David Fincher). I saw a recommendation on Amazon about Memento and bought it, but I would rate that only 3 stars."
1,WARNING! STOP! RED LIGHT! LISTEN UP!,"DO NOT BUY THIS LOST HIGHWAY IMPORT DVD! I should have trusted the other reviewer who said that the transfer quality is beyond awful because it is! Honestly, the quality of this import DVD is as bad as a poor quality bootleg DVD. There is a small strip on the left side of the picture because the picture isn't centered. The look of the picture is very poor and grainy. The sound does not even match up with the picture. I love this movie, but do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this import DVD. The VHS version not only looks better than the import DVD, but it is also in widescreen."
3,"Movie gets 5 stars, DVD transfer gets 1 star","I swear it looks like this movie was put on DVD by a 14 year old with his home computer. The quality looks so much like VHS that was put to DVD that I think it is a shell game to a consumer to let them think this movie is available on ""DVD.""Movie is great, but DVD quality so poor hard to ignore."
1,Do not buy this DVD!!!,"This version of Lost Highway is a 'pan and scan' version. For those of you who are not familiar with this 'cropping' device, it essentially cuts out pieces of the frame in order for it to fit on a television screen, effectively changing what the director had intended for the audience to see. This version is in no way viewable."
3,Letdown,"I rented this movie because the name piqued my curiosity, and I liked the soundtrack. As a matter of fact, the only reason I rated this movie at 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the soundtrack, but I think that the average person who's not age 20 wouldn't care too much for it. I expected this movie to have a kind of soul-fallen-from-grace attitude, and it did, but was very hard to understand. I thought about the plot over and over and couldn't figure out how everything fit together. I've seen and heard other people say that you have to ""get"" this film to enjoy it, but I wonder if they actually do get it, since nobody I've talked to can tell me about it, instead they just say ""you have to get it."" Personally I think this was just a collage of the director's emotions, and though many say that's a form of expressive art, I think that a good director makes the film about the viewer, not himself."
4,weird an odd movie. i like it!!,"this movie was odd an great. at first i was like what am i wacthing? then at the end i was like whoa!!!! thats some crazy s***!! i loved it. an i can see how ppl say it is like a masterpiece painting.it was like a beatiful,scary,fun dream all at once. an i'm glad i can take it agian an agian. check this movie out, it's a trip.(plus look for marilyn MANSON as a porno star! that kicked a**!!)"
3,A Woman's Life Makes A Life Like Mine...,"I'm glad other reviewers have seen the same thing in this story - that Bill Pullman's character is in a kind of personal hell, reliving his murder of his own wife.Just listen to the song by Hank Williams. I heard for the first time a year and a half after I saw the movie and it put the whole thing into perspective for me.I saw this years ago in the theatre, so beyond that, all I remember are beautiful colors, Robert Blake calling himself on the phone (and looking just like Richard Benson - The Avenger!), and a stunning Patricia Arquette. However, I'm game for another viewing after these reviews.If you're just starting out with David Lynch, a good jump off point is The Elephant Man and Wild At Heart, then segue into the wierder stuff with Blue Velvet and Eraserhead (that movie makes me ill), maybe even Dune if that's your cup of tea."
3,Fantastic Movie,"If you have a Mulholland Drive withdrawal get this DVD.Why?1) God only knows when the official region 1 DVD will come out.It could be next year, 5 years from, maybe never.2) OK, the DVD is not perfect ... but the movie is."
1,Not official american release,"Buyers take note- The seller states that ""This is the PAL Region 2. Multi-Region dvd player will play."". None of the other reviews make this distinction. Your normal american dvd player will not play this. Hopefully someone with a multi-region dvd player will actually buy a copy and review it so we can get a clue what the quality of this copy is like."
3,"Good film, bad dvd","This movie is excellent if you are into david lynch or any other movies that make you think. Instead of the director telling you exactly what's happening, he has you experience it from the main characters point of view. The reason i gave this movie 3 stars was only because of the quality of this dvd. I would have given it a 1 star if it wasn't for the actual movie. Get the 2 disc version from amazon uk. It's a million times better. That one gets 5 stars."
2,Lyncherei,"About as comprehensible as one expects a David Lynch movie to be, but not completely unwatchable (I finsihed it!).Robert Blake appears to have been made up to look like Lugosi doing Dracula (sans cape). This is perhaps intended to be a clue to something or other.The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. In turn, the best part of the soundtrack is This Mortal Coil (with Elizabeth Fraser's chastely sensuous voice) performing a haunting cover of Tim Buckley's ""Song to the Siren."" Predictably, it's missing from the soundtrack album."
4,what?,"I loved this film, even though i didnt have a clue what was going on for the most part. The story involves something about dual personality's or something. The lighting and camerawork is fantastic, Lynch can really create atmosphere.There are some great cameos in this film aswell. Mainly from Henry Rollins, Marilyn Manson and Richard Pryor, being big fans of all three I was elated to find out that they were in this film.The soundtrack is fantastic aswell. Rammstein's creepy music is used to maximum effect. It's pretty much a definitive industrial collection.If you havent seen this film and are on the look out for something original then i advise you to check this out. And if you find out what it was all about post it on this site because I would like to know."
5,About time,Lost highway has finally been given the treatment it deserves in a two disc special edition released in Australia (region 4) gone is the 2 channel soundtrack replaced with 5.1 and in DTS! You will either love or hate this film as with most of David Lynch's works theres no in-between. And while on the subject of Lynch when the heck is season 2 of Twin Peaks going to be released?
5,"Finally, a movie that really makes you think.","American audiences are so used to being spoon-fed the same crap in movies that movies like Lost Highway are rejected by audiences because they don't have a plot that a second-grader could understand. Yes, the plot in Lost Highway is very difficult to follow, no matter how smart you are. You'll definitely have to watch it several times to catch all the intricacies.Some problems with it.. the first hour of the film was horrendously boring. David Lynch could have easily shortened the film by 30-40 minutes if he cut out all the scenes with Pullman staring blankly into nothing.I was grateful for all the sex and nudity, too. Finally a director has the guts to make a movie with *gasp* promiscuous sex in it.Don't let my glowing review fool you, though. Chances are you probably won't like this movie. Oh, well."
3,bummed about no features,"i love this movie. i had no problem following it when i first saw it in the theater and still love it today. i am extremely bummed out by the fact that the features that were to accompany this disc were omitted. the multi angle featurette with lynch is clearly not here. i haven't checked out the transfer quality yet but my guess is that it is a high compression transfer, around 5 gb or so. buy it for the movie if you don't have a region 2 player . if you do, buy the german release."
3,better than nothing,"as a film id give this 5 stars as a dvd, 3...for some reason the image quality is barely above the vhs version and the version i bought was the pan-scan version....i read somewhere that theres a possiblity of a full fleged american version coming out soon but until then this is as good as it gets...."
4,"well done, but not for all tastes.","Now, at first, if you got this movie because you expected a violent horror film due to its hard-edge soundtrack including NIN and Manson, then you are sadly mistaken. I am a very big fan of Lynch's work as Blue Velvet and Eraserhead are amazing films, and although this is an obvious Lynch film, it just isn't as beautiful as the other films. It is prototypically weird, and if you are distracted for a second, things can get very mixed up. So watch intently, because it is a good movie. Just ""NOT"" for all tastes."
3,"This DVD has the movie, and that's it!","The movie still feels like an extended student film, you know, with a young boy's horny mind that came up with this, with its porn and jealousy and drugs and lots of naked sexy sex with pretty women and voyeurism in it - know what I mean? It's a manifestation of everything that a horny, drugged out, student mind might come up with in his boredom in college classes.It's a very simple movie, done fairly poorly, especially the first 30 minutes - if you can get past that, you'll be OK, but wow, will it put you to sleep, that first 30 minutes."
1,Either I'm going deaf or the movie volume stinks,"Haven't watched but 5 minutes of the movie because the volume of the movie is so low I can't hear anything being said unless I turn it up to 30 on my television where I usually have it at 8 or 10! I'll try watching on my computer with my headset cranked and see if I can't make out what is said,"
1,Disappointment,"If I ever meet D.Lynch, I'll probably ask him my 10 kuna (Croatian currency) back for renting this video.Or at least a good explanation.I mean, I liked ""Twin Peaks"", ""Blue Velvet""...and this movie has the same oneiric atmosphere, same colours, valvet curtains etc. But anything else!!"
1,"An absolute waste of film, money, and talent","Lost Highway is certainly one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Until the last moment, I was somewhat intrigued by the incomprehensible story, waiting for answers. It was extremely difficult to stand the many unpleasant and disgusting scenes of the movie, yet I was hoping that at least it was all for a purpose. However, when I discovered that all of this was only for its own sake and could never be explained by anything other than ""life itself"" (probable meaning of the title), I could find no excuse for the existence of this work. What kind of life is this, anyway?! Musically, this is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen, but when the beautiful sountrack is wasted in such a pathetic way, it does not redeem the movie too much. Definitely the most unpleasant film by David Lynch so far."
5,LOST LOST HIGHWAY,"This is an awful print of the film and not worth the purchase. I recommend the 2-disc version on region 2, a fine anamorphic print ,with a vibrant DTS track. David Lynch is the master of the surreal and if you want to experience it properly then check out the european print"
4,"Excellent film, not as confusing as some would have you believe","I disagree with the opening line of the Amazon Editorial review which says ""Plot is a meaningless term when trying to describe Lost Highway"". Frankly that's the answer for lazy people who don't like thinking as part of their movie-watching. [SPOILER (kinda) ALERT] The plot is an answer to a question: How do people deal with a reality so horrific they can't face it?Also, if you've never seen a David Lynch film, you'll see that the anngles, the colors, the elements and scale in the shots, are all part of his mood setup and are jsut as important to what he's going for as the story is."
4,David Lynch is a force to be reckoned with...,"Well, as anyone who has seen the other works of David Lynch, he is a force to be reckoned with in modern cinema.There are not many other (if at all, really?) film-makers quite like him.Lost Highway is a simple story but its told in a very twisted way.The atmosphere alone is strange enough and the many plot twists only make the experience better.I have to say that many people might be turned off by the un-conventional story telling here but please give it a chance and watch it with an open mind.Everything about this movie is great, from the music to the characters and the bizarre atmosphere that only David Lynch could create.The DVD picture qulity is very good but I was a little sad to find no special feature at all.This is also a movie that seems to get better the more times you watch it because you may notice things you never noticed before and the story may become clearer."
5,"disturbing , yet beautifully executed","Every time I watch this movie, i get another little piece of the puzzle. Those of you who don't want to think about abnormal psychology, how the mind operates in a fugue state, or alternate states of being should not get involved with this movie , but anyone who wants to think HARD should definely watch Lost Highway right now. just know that the only conclusions you're going to get are the ones you come to yourself."
5,THE GREATEST CULT CLASSIC OF ALL!,"Okay, it's cryptic. Okay, it's bizarre. Okay, it doesn't make immediate sense. WHO CARES? Looking at some of the other responses from Amazon patrons, a lot of you do. But hear me out. As far as I'm concerned, Lost Highway is one of the most intelligent, frightening and visually (not to mention aurally) stunning films of recent years. Its depiction of a jealous man who kills his adulterous wife, and then becomes (literally) a new man poses a wide range of questions about our Self: who are we really? Why do we do the things we do? The atmosphere is brilliant, Patricia Arquette is the greatest femme fatale of 'em all, and Robert Blake's Mystery Man (i.e. the dark side of the killer) is one creepy dude. So come on all you fast food viewers, put down your new action blockbuster and get into Lost Highway. As Gary Busey's character says, it'll do ya good."
1,Someone Must Pay,When I saw that this DVD is not avaialable in widescreen I chewed off my left leg. Someone must pay. It is a crime.
4,Avoid 2002/2003 dvd version...,"""Lost Highway"" (1997) is directed by David Lynch. The film is about a saxophonist named Fred Madison (Bill Pullman) who murders his wife (Patricia Arquette) for being unfaithful and then goes insane in prison. Most of the film seems to be about Fred's surreal recollections after he is imprisoned, which are filled with dread, erotic recollections and the despair of a banal distrustful life. 135 minutes seems just about right for this film as it finishes with a flurry of bizarre and haunting images. Lynch cut this film down by 25 minutes after its initial screening.The 2002/2003 full screen dvd is a horrible transfer so be careful to only buy the 2008 Universal Studios' Focus Features dvd version which is in the proper anamorphic widescreen format of 2.35:1 with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. There are no special features on either dvd version."
3,Canadian Version is Terrible! Not worth your $,"The movie itself is fantastic. Lost Highway is a beautifully designed film executed with skill in every area. See it. However, the Canadian DVD release is probably the worst DVD I have ever seen. For starters it is in 4:3 ration instead of widescreen 16:9. Secondly, the film transfer is terrible. It almost looks worse than VHS. Truly a terrible picture. Sound is just fine although nothing special. Judge for yourself, but I think you would be better off waiting for an American release (hopefully with widescreen and significantly better picture quality)."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!,"I bought this DVD without noticing it wasn't widescreen because the store sticker was on top of the info. I was pretty mad when I got home and realized this. Then I sat down to watch it. I got hysterical. This is the worst DVD I have ever seen!!!! The compression looks like a bad internet stream, there's a faint white line that flashes randomly across the picture (like a ghost image), the sound is ordinary at best. I don't know who did this hack job but I certainly intend to find out and complain. I'm sure a high school kid with an iMac would've done a better job at compressing this movie. It honestly looks like a copy of a copy of a pirated copy!David Lynch is one of my favorite directors and I just can't believe he approved this. If you need a Lynch fix, get Blue Velvet and wait for a ""real"" version of Lost Highway. This edition is absolute trash."
1,The emperor has no clothes!,"Make a movie that's a piece of rubbish and put David Lynch's name on it, some will call it a work of genius. Even taking into account that the middle of the movie may be the desired recollection of the main character, Fred, or that the movie purposely mixes-up scenes, this movie, The Lost Highway, is still garbage. The first act with Fred as himself is boring!David Lynch is a fine director, but his screenplays and ideas are just plain dumb. The avant garde crowd may think he's a genius but it takes the average Joe to point out the truth: most of David Lynch's movies are really stupid."
1,What's the Point ?,This whole thing about Lost Highway as something to watch over and over again is ludicrous. I can't understand why a movie goer is supposed to watch it 14 times before enlightenment comes. Okay its not for everybody - but neither is Star Wars or Last Tango in Paris. What's your point? I think this movie is plugged into some art genre but not the average movie goer looking for entertainment. I liked Blue Velvet from David Linch and I liked Twin Peaks. I thought this movie was strange - that's all.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,Can you say: BORING? or POINTLESS? There was only about 3 scenes that caught half my attention. You would have to be ONE SCREWED UP PERSON to love this film.
2,THIS IS STRANGELY SATAYED,"I remember seeing this one in a cinema back in the day with me homies. Good times. After the film was over, drivebys. Good times."
1,"This disc ""Univeral""ly sucks","I wish I could find the original Amazon listing, copy it, paste it on an E-mail and send it to Universal home video and ask ""Where the *** are the bonus features you said were going to be on this edition. This ranks way up at the top of most disappointing DVD releases. It is unforgiveable. I was genuinely angry when I put the DVD in my player and saw the menu (with music that's not even from the film, WTF?) The video transfer and sound quality are great. I never owned the Canadian version, because I had a widescreen VHS copy. It's great to finally complete my David Lynch DVD collection, but I am vastly disappointed with this release."
1,"Pretentious, tedious, dull etc.......","Let me first start by stating that I am huge David Lynch aficionado. I like all of his films ( I will vehemently defend Dune and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) except for this disappointing effort. I like films that meander and are nonlinear in structure but Lost Highway is just boring and headache inducing. I recommend taking dramamine before being subjected to the sledgehammer aesthetics that Lynch throws at you on the screen. Also does the film have a point? Perhaps, but I was in so much excruciating pain to even care about the characters or try to dechiper the plot. The other friends I watched this with were either asleep or checking their watches for when it would be over. This film is nowhere in the class of Eraserhead, Blue Velvet or Wild At Heart. At least Mr. Lynch redeemed himself with his next effort The Straight Story."
2,Film...has...many..........pauses.......................,"I think that guy in white makeup is Pullman's unconscious, so Pullman does in fact murder his wife (they're not exactly giddy honeymooners). At this point Pullman loses a few sheep in the top paddock and re-invents himself as the Getty character, a construction that eases his guilt and creates a fantasy scenario for a new love, unfortunatley he's a bit obsessed with old lady so that even here Arquette's character can't love him. I'm probably way off here. I have a headache."
2,Typical Lynch Film,"I wonder when I'll ever understand any other David Lynch film than 'The Straight Story'. 'Lost Highway' is a very typical Lynch film: lots of alternative filming and effects, lots of interesting music - it's often like one long music video, really - and lots of beautiful Patricia Arquette. But the story, hmmm... is as usual not for people with normal IQs."
2,Lost Highway not so good,"The film quality is excellent and the DVD transfer didn't lose much. The actors are top notch, but the storyline is just weird and difficult to follow. I found the first half boring and was ready to pull the plug, but it got better in the second half. If there was a plot in there, I could not find it. If you are looking for an easy to follow, entertaining movie, Lost Highway is not the one for you."
1,I don't get it.,"I've used a couple different kinds of mouthguards over the years, and this is the only one I have downright hated. It fit awkwardly, it felt flimsy, it moved while I slept, and then after only a week of using it, I chomped it right in half while I was sleeping. Do not buy this product unless it is a last resort."
2,Poor materials,"I wore the pre-redesigned version of this night guard for months and when I replaced it with this one, I bit through it in two weeks."
4,The Best To Date,"I have tried everything and this really is the best I've found so far. Mine lasted around 4 months and I bought another one. It is too expensive for what it is, I think the company that makes this could sell it for $20 and still make a profit. But it still beats what the dentist would charge. It's available at Target stores which makes it easy to obtain."
4,Very impressed,"Simple design which is very effective. Have always grind/clenched my teeth during sleep, but only recently was it causing me discomfort during the day, even though dentist saw signs long ago. Love that this is no-boil and has a very light footprint. Stayed in the first night and has for most of the time I've had the product. Your teeth will feel weird for a while after you start using this product but if you once wore a retainer at night this should feel no different; your mouth will adjust in time and you will be fine. While I am not sure if this can truly replace a doctor-prescribed bite guard, this is an effective low-cost start and/or alternative."
3,sleep right secure comfort dental guard,"Definitely a great price compared to a professional night guard from a dentist. Getting use to it is a little tricky for me. I'm a VERY light sleeper and my body recognizes something ""foreign"" in my mouth. But I will keep trying and I think it will work."
2,may fit other mouths better,"Had one of the $500 grinding guards... always felt like a tennis racquet in my mouth.Bought both the Plackers and the Sleep Right guards to compare.Sleep Right is adjustable, but abraids my cheek.Plackers can be worn on top or bottom arcade, whichever works better.Plackers is meant to be worn only 3 times, but I've been using mine for a month, and it's working great!Definitely recommend the Plackers over the Sleep Right."
1,Piece of junk and a waste of money,"The flexible nature of the product created a gagging sensation, and no matter how it was adjusted always felt like I would swallow it during the night. I had a difficult time even trying to figure out which end went up & which went down. I tried it for one week, then gave up. I went back to the solid units which you boil. Do not believe the hype on these. When I tried to return it I got the run-around and when I finally sent it back the company claimed they neverreceived it, so I'm out $39.99 The company is as sketchy as their product."
3,not for everyone,some people may have a hard time with anything in their mouth all night i know i do.have not been able to get used to it but seems to fit good and i am sure it works if you can get over the hurdle of having something in your mouth all night.
2,Very expensive when you need to continually replace,"I really love the design of this product. I have tried many different night guards and this is definitely my favorite as far as comfort. The problem I had was exorbitant cost and durability.I bought this in the first place because my dentist quoted me at $500 for an acrylic night guard. Presumably, the Sleep Right would be a better option, but for $40 each, they don't last long. I found that I ground through mine in about 30 days. I would actually give Sleep Right a glowing review if they let you buy the replacement grind pads for a reasonable price or if they gave you a few extra grind pads per pack...but since you have to buy the entire set with the main piece that holds the pads, carrying case, and packaging, this turns into a $500/year investment that is no longer worth it. Like I said, great design, but they are pricing themselves right past the more durable versions you can get specially fitted at the dentist."
3,Pads too think,The pads were too think for me which put added pressure on my jaw joints. I am going to try the smaller one next.
4,Pretty good guard,"I grind my teeth when I sleep, pretty severely. I've had a variety of night guards, from the 400 dollar custom made to the cheap-o sports guards. I keep coming back to this one. Its not ideal -- the front strap in front of the bottom teeth doesn't adjust enough, for instance. But it does stand up to my grinding, and there's very little adjusting to make it fit for me. And when I grind through it, it's not such a big deal, since these are relatively inexpensive."
2,"Good concept, bad materials","After five or six nights, right after getting used to it, it broke up. Materials are very lousy, and even though it is a good idea, the product is bad, and pretty expensive for what you get in exchange."
5,best we've ever used,"Works well under normal use - ordered extras to have spares on hand, as these sometimes are hard to find at good price"
5,Very grateful,"I just got my dental guard, the shipping was amazingly fast to my country even though it is holiday season. The package arrived in good condition. The dental guard is excellent, really help my with my grinding."
3,Sleep Right dental guard,"The product price was good and it works reasonably well. However, I find it does not stay in place all night, and I usually end up waking with it out of position and removing it in the night. Next time I would pay a little more for a personally fitted product."
3,Nice alternative to dentist office night guard,"Very effective for clenching, does wear out every 2 months with regular use. A cheap and easy alternative to a custom night guard. I like this better than the custom one my dentist created."
5,The Little Pump That Can,"Bought this for my Exo Terra Nano (8""X 8""X 12"") Terrarium (I can only put about 2-1/2 inches of water in it) and used a 10"" riser to the top and it works fantastic. I adjusted the flow to high and it has no problem pumping the water to the top to make a nice waterfall. Runs silently too!"
5,"Powerful and engaging, no other book like it!","This is a MUST READ for anyone who is searching for success, peace and understanding. Every page is filled with answers to questions about relationships, having a dream and achieving it, living an empowered life, and enjoying every moment of every day. Each chapter brought me a new understanding of myself, and with it, a deep abiding sense of peace. My business has grown as a result and I am finding solutions to problems in ways I had not dreamed possible!! Her techniques WORK!!! A fantastic book!"
2,Poorly written,"This is the author's fifth or so book on the assassination? My first impression of the book is that it went from hand written notes to publishing in one step.The author spends a great deal of time trying to blame the Hunts and others of the super rich class, and by his twisted logic calling them 'The Radical Right'.The Hunts, George Soros, Bill Gates, and others of the Super Rich class don't go around calling themselves Republicans or Democrats, Conservatives or Liberals. They have no loyalty to any party or cause. They are the puppeteers.So, the title of this book implies that radical far right Republicans were responsible for the entire conspiracy. In present day language, Tea Party Conservatives.Harry should change the title to read ""The Super Rich and the Assassination of JFK""."
1,blairrrw@att;net,The sub title of this is misleading. It says Adobe upgrade version. It is an upgrade of an existing version and cannot be used as a stand alone system. I had to return mine as I did not have the original versionBlair Williams
2,~ This Book Did Not Do It For Me ~,"This was my first book by Marilyn Pappano, I was disappointed, when I first got this I could not wait to read it, this book did not do it for me, Some parts of the book I did enjoy and some parts went down hill for me .Happy Reading Lisa"
4,Engaging,"In 1949, after years of publishing historical sagas,DdM produced ""The Parasites"" -- a fascinating socialcomedy. 3 siblings whose parents were famous performersreflect on their lives after the humorless husband of onecalls them parasites. He's a boor, jealous of theirworldliness, easy talent and charm. People find themirresistible.It's a most personal novel for DdM, coming when hermarriage was in crisis. The siblings mirror differentaspects of DdM's personality. On publication, it disappointedher fans: it lacks gothic trappings, suspense, romance.It's a portrait of several lives and crammed with insightfulcomedy. It also has an incestuous motif and a wounding finale.""The Parasites"" is not for readers with Third Grade mentality.DdM again conveys rich atmosphere with a few strokes; sheknows how to entertain on a high level. She reminds us thatwe can survive anything, except death."
2,Disappointing,"I've read most all of Daphne DuMaurier's books and loved them. This one had an interesting title and I picked it up expecting a good read or at least some redeeming quality to the book. Instead, it turned out to be a most depressing book about shallow, inconsequential, trivial people. The only one who makes any personal change at all is Niall. This is a book about wasted lives and was a waste of that portion of my life that I spent reading it. Even her writing did not seem to be up to its usual quality. Personal recommendation? Don't waste your time!"
2,"Well written and interesting, but doesn't really go anywhere","It is an interesting story that follows the lives of three siblings. I was constantly hoping for something exciting or suspenseful to happen (like most of Daphne's books), but nothing really did. It had a somewhat surprising ending, but by then I didn't care anymore."
5,This Is Our Faith: A Catholic Catechism for Adults,"A very affordable ""user friendly"" pearl of a book discussing Christain Catholic spiritual and Faith believes and Tradition. The price is affordaable. Excellent buy!"
4,Adult Catholic Religious Education,I am a Parish Administrator. My duties include the education of the faithful in the ways of our faith. I also must offer an educational process to those individuals who are interested in joining the Catholic faith. The book 'This Is Our Faith' by Michael Francis Pennock is a comprehensive presentation of the Doctrines of the Faith. It invites those in our R.C. I. A. program ( the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) to actively participate in each lesson.

I am pleased with this text and would recommend it with high regard. Thank you.
3,Impressive presentation of Catholic faith and practice.,"This a well-thought-out book, very readable, and an excellent introduction of Catholic teaching. Ideal for use as a text book in RCIA, used in conjunction with the Bible and the Catechism of the Catholic Church."
1,I think a few photos in color was missing!,"Has a very broad content for beginners. But one off the thinks that makes this fly art incredible is the surrounding, and in B&W you may get a little depress when you are reading it!"
5,Great Book!,"I'm reading this book right now and I love it! I used to read his articles years ago in Field and Stream and Outdoor Life and Sports Afield and I'd forgotten what a fine writer he was. I like the way he tells good stories while he's taking fishing and even though I can't yet get to some of the places he's writing about, he sure makes me want to be there. This is the sort of book that a book lover will enjoy and a book lover who is also a fly fisher will especially enjoy every bit of it! My husband, Tom, who is a writer himself, also has read it and is every bit as keen on it as I."
2,verbose but not informative,"After reading several beginners books on flyfishing, it isclear that this one misses the mark. Try the Orvis guides.Any of them. Try the curtis creek manifesto, which inabout 40 pages, does more than this book in hundreds.This book starts out good, and actually has some goodinformation, but when it gets down to fishing forcertain species, most of the ""advice"" is really justregalling how good the author is at fishing.If you want a ""feel good"" type of book, this mightbe the one for you. But if you want to catch fishon flies, try other sources instead."
5,"Now a bit out of date, a good study guide","As a Presbyterian pastor, I actually took a class on the confessions with Jack Rogers. We used this book, which gave me the foundation to understand the confessions and their place within PCUSA and how they impacted our faith journey.As PCUSA considers the new translation of the Helvetic Confession, and reconsiders whether to continue to study the incorporation of the Belkan Confession, it is doubly important for all of us to struggle with the confessions that are currently included in our Book of Confessions.This is a wonderful study guide that will help all of us understand our historical past."
2,Disappointed. Get Munsch's early works instead,"I bought this after reading Munsch's early stories like ""Paperbag Princess"" and ""David's Father"". They were charming light hearted stories that the kids loved to listen to. But the stories in this collection are bizarre and creepy. ""Millicent and the Wind"" is about a little girl who lives out in the wilderness with her family and her only friend is the wind. In the end she asks the wind to kidnap another child to her house so she has somebody to play with. ""The Boy In The Drawer"" is beyond strange. A little girl finds a tiny boy (leprechaun?) in her room who does crazy things like grow tomato plants in her bed. When she tells her parents the only thing they tell her is to clean it up. What's the point? The only story that is cute and appropriate for a young reader is ""Moira's Birthday"". Otherwise I would recommend you skip this volume and look up Munsch's first collection of stories."
2,not very glad...,"received very quickly but the quality is not very good. Acceptable, but looks cheap, and feels cheap and do not think it can last long. Before this, I bought one, made in China, quality was really bad. The picture on amazon showed it was made in Taiwan, I thought the quality would be better than one I had. Bad luck. same quality. Note: the hole is very small."
2,Cost,"The 1/16"" hole punch was a good size for punching holes in fabric in order to crochet an edging. The only fault that I have is the pricing. Martha Stewart makes a 1/16"" hole punch, sold at WalMart for much less money and without the extra cost of shipping.So sorry Fiskars"
2,Meh...,"I use it to punch cardstock... worked great for the first few months of heavy use, then the cushioned handles fell off and now it doesn't punch cleanly. It was the second one I'd bought. The first one broke in half after about 3 months. I'll probably buy it again because I don't see any better options, but I recommend not duct taping the cushions when they inevitably fall off. What a mess that became!"
5,Give it a 1-2 punch!,"This nifty hole puncher certainly gets the job done at our house and childcare! I use it frequently to hang up the kids' art (punches construction paper effortlessly), create lacing projects for them (through thick, 5-7mm lamination), and let the kids punch holes in paper. If it's held up to my constant use AND that of the kids, you know it's durable. The grips are comfy (and have never fallen off), it punches through a few pieces of paper smoothly, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE that it catches the punches instead of dropping them all over my floor (I then save those for the kids to use wherever their artisitc creativity takes them). The puncher doesn't get stuck like many others I have used. The price was ever-so-slightly higher than what I wanted to pay, but it's ergonomic handles are infintely better than the basic metal punchers I'm used to."
1,So Much for That,Purchased this hoping to use it for punching chip board. Worked for the first three punches and then broke. Don't bother if you want something with some heft.
5,Great little punch!,Perfect for my needs. The punch punches easily and cleanly. And I love that the little punched-out pieces are caught and don't get scattered about.
4,Good enough.,"This hole puncher was affordable considering how much they cost. However, it was a little difficult to use and the rubber on the handles would sometimes slip off if used repeatedly."
4,Best for ustomizing a tennis racket..,"I used this as puncher for led tapes in customizing my tennis rackets. In order to add weight on the frame, I stick the punched led circles neatly at my desired location. Improvise"
5,Adding to my punch collection,"This size filled in the gap between the very small 1/16th hole and the normal 1/4"" hole. It makes a nice sized hole for making pages for a small notebook's filler paper."
3,Unfulfilling,"I went through a bit of a strange faze where I bought obscure music with a vaguely indie theme.So it was that I came to own Jellyfish Kiss.More Sonic Youth than Inspiral Carpets, and frankly, more American the English.Thus, not to my taste.But that is not to say that it isnt any good - there is talent in here somewhere, and enough to make it a very good album for certain people.I cant remember that last time I saw this CD. Somewhere at the back of the cupboard next to the Original Soundtrack to Batman - The Movie. Maybe I should bring it out of retirement for another spin...."
3,log truck,the truck was a gift for my grandson for christmas. there was a piece missing on the truck bed.my daughter was going to contact the campany for the part. i don't know if she did or not. my grandson loved the toy.
2,Nice to look at.........,"Wow, what a disappointment, this is an awesome truck ""to look at"" but was very disappointed when we gave it as a gift to our Grandson who takes very good care of his toys. This is definetely not a toy, needs to be on a display shelf for looks only. They say it is ""diecast"" , the cab only.. all the working parts are thin plastic, before we got it out of the box, the pin that holds the trailer to the cab snapped off, plastic. The most used area of this truck not even metal!! Anyway after some tears and explanation to our Grandson, we sent it back. Wish we knew that it was more of a ""collector's item"" before expecting to give it as a toy. Mimi in Pa."
2,Mac Log Trailer Truck,"Very poor quality and dissatisfied overall. It would be a fun toy if constructed with quality parts and NOT PLASTIC. It hurts and frustrates me to see my grandchild try his best and work with the truck when the ""oonnector arm"" from the truck cab to the trailer has broken in two. The cost to construct this product must have been next to nil using plastic intead of metal. My grandchild is not abusive with his toys.......he cherishes them and enjoys expressing his imagination.Very unhappy."
4,Mack log trailer,I ordered this truck for my son who is 4 1/2 years old and he absolutley loved this truck. He opened it christmas day and was so excited that santa got it for him. Its the truck he always wanted he said. He plays with it everyday. It is a fragile truck so I have to make sure he takes care of it since hes a little rough so far it came apart but my husbnad was able to fix it. Overall I was happy with the purchase and so was my son. The truck was flawless and brand new just like the seller said and arrived on or before the time they said. I will definitely buy from this seller again and would recommend them.
2,Fun but Breakable,My child loves this toy unfortunately it has been played with in our home for less than a month and the trailer has already broke. Why can we not have all metal toys instead of part metal and part plastic. There should be a plastic repair kit sent with every toy bought. The toys do not last very long anymore.:(
5,The Ventures Are The Greatist,"I've been a Ventures freak for over 25 years.Rock'n'Roll Forever was the fisrt album of theirs I ever heard and to this day,still is!!Sounds great on C.D.The second album on the C.D. is ""Now Playing""Featuring such songs as Everybody's Talking,Sounds of Silence,and an exceptional Dueling Banjos!If you enjoy or are curious about the earlier Ventures,THIS IS A MUST!!"
5,Amazon.com Owes This CD All My Money,"I actually have my amazon account because of this cd. I was listening to iTunes Radio one night, and on one of the GOA/PsyTrance stations, they played Space Dwarfs. I was blown away. So I tried to track down a copy of the cd. Didn't happen. I even tried to download it, and no luck. So I went on amazon and found the cd. And Im glad i did.It's a great cd. Anyone who likes Goa / PsyTrance will love it. It's got a great driving beat all through the cd, and makes fantastic material for taking to the gym or just chilling at home or dancing all night. Take it from me, this is one great cd.I highly highly recommend getting a nice pair of headphones, and cranking up Space Dwarfs to as loud as you can take it. High Energy abounds."
1,"Lousy Story, Poorly Written","I read a LOT. Probably 4-6 books a month. I really enjoy reading a source novel from a motion picture, and I've read enough that I don't expect the novel to follow the movie exactly, or in some cases even closely.This was one of the most convoluted, poorly written books I have ever read. There really wasn't much of a plot, and the characters were not developed at all. I've read better stories submitted for a sixth grade English class.Save your time and money on this one."
4,An early Sinatra classic,"This black-and-white musical is one of a pair that Frank Sinatra made in 1944 for RKO (the other was Higher and Higher) - his first movies. In the companion movie Sinatra plays himself, but here he dons the persona of a singer who wants to be taken seriously as a playwright. This film is a musical remake of the Marx Brothers' 1935 film Room Service. Sinatra's co-star was the young and lovely Gloria de Haven and together they make beautiful music out of a fine Jule Styne (mus.) and Sammy Cahn (lyr.) score that included such standards as `Some other time' (not to be confused with the Bernstein, Comden and Green tune from On The Town), `As long as there's music', `Where does love begin' and the production number `Come out, come out, wherever you are'. For a movie of its time, this is more entertaining than many, helped no doubt by Tim Whelan's slick direction."
5,Great Product,"The product did exactly what it said it would do. It was even slightly larger than I expected it to be, which was perfect.."
3,Okay,"I bought this ring with the intention of stacking it with a fake engagement ring found also on gem avenue. However, with a solitaire ring, it didn't really look good stacked. The ring is also a little bigger than my other size 10 rings. Anyways, I wear it as a thumb ring and it looks good there."
2,Not that good,i got the white color version and was happy about it but this one is half the goods/worth.
4,"Great product for ""beginner""","These bells sound good. Included in the kit are two double-ended rubber mallets and the bells. The bells themselves are very thin (assume steel?), which isn't a problem for a beginner but these are not a replacement for a high quality bell kit. Suitable for practice and light use. Tone is good, but don't have the depth of sound that a higher quality kit would have. No stand included, but the hard case is a nice addition. Case is relatively thin plastic, but perfectly adequate."
1,A spud of a book,"This book illuminates little known aspects of the Dutch potato. As a deeply insightful analysis of the varieties of Dutch potato during the early cold war era, it lays the foundations for a better understanding of the current day status of the potato in northern europe. More on the link between potatoes and chips would have been helpful to the modern reader, but this would be to impose a retrospective view on the spud of the past."
1,Wow!,"THis movie for lack of a better word BORING! The charecters in this movie have no depth. The plot is about a guy who runs a shower house. WHO CARES! The movie feels like it's 10 hours long. Buy it for foreign taste, but not for a movie that makes you think."
5,The value of tradition,"It seems that China's rapid development is making some Chinese wonder about what they may be losing. This charming film tells the story of a man who returns home after many years from his busy life in the city to the bath house run by his father and retarded brother. He is gradually seduced by the peace and sense of community that he finds there, as well as his awakened sense of responsibility toward his aging father and handicapped younger brother. Touching and funny, with a wonderful cast of sharply drawn supporting characters. Writing about it makes me want to watch it again."
5,Surprisingly Good,"I was not initially excited about the prospect of watching 2 hours of Chinese men semi-nude in a bath house. After a little bit of a slow start, the film begins to wrap your interest around the lives touched by the bath house. An adult son living in south China returns to his elderly father's business when he thinks he has died. The clash of modern life with Chinese filial tradition provides a potent mechanism to advance the story. Great comic relief is provided by the up's and down's of daily Chinese life, which is not all that different from what we experience in America. The actor who plays the mentally challenged brother is amazing in his role. By the end of the movie you are personally engaged in what will happen to the house and the family. Give this film a shot if you like to laugh, as well as enjoy stories about our common humanity."
3,"Loved the Series, Hate the New Edit","I have enjoyed this series since the 80's. For some reason, I don't know why, Berry decided to rename the main characters. J'Quel D'Trelna has far more appeal to me than Jaquel Detrelna. K'Ronar and S'Cotar became part of the rhythm of the story, Kronar sounds like something out of some Tarzan story. Scotar sounds like cooties. His edit destroyed the feel of the story. I still have three of the four books in paperback. I will track down the fourth. If I had done the edit, I would have changed the names on in Quadrant Blue Nine. That would have made a little cultural diversity."
5,"Definately a ""Wow, that was amazing movie""","""The Game"" is quite possibly the most exquisite and original movie I have yet to see. A plot line similar to that of a roller coaster ride provides an ""edge of the seat"" experience. Michael Douglas' acting is nothing less than immaculate. A music score Mozart himself could be proud of and directing that puts Spielberg to shame culminate into an Action/Mystery extravaganza. The first time one sees this thriller, their mind is left captivated for hours on end. I advocate this movie to anyone who is into plot line twists like ""The Sixth Sense."" In fact, this masterpiece is so excellent, you don't even need to bother renting it, just go ahead and buy it."
5,AWESOME!,"Edge of my seat, can watch it many more times type of movie. Recommend to anyone who likes suspense and action. Simply AWESOME!"
3,A so-so moive,Too pretenious. They did so much try to surprise audience that it was indeed too much.
4,Great suspenseful mind-twister,"Lots of people did not like this movie, and I cannot understand why. Good acting for the most part, tight story, shot well, great suspence, and some nifty twists and turns. What's not to like?Sean Penn is fantastic as usual, and Michael Douglas plays himself as usual (including the rich part). It's not the absolutely most original plot in the world, but it is quite enjoyable."
5,DAVID FINCHER DOES IT AGAIN!!!,David Fincher to put it simply is the MAN!!! He amazed me with SEVEN and did it agian with this movie. I loved seven so I went to see The Game in the theaters and was blown away. Fincher is my favorite director he makes ORIGINAL movies with great twists and turns. You have to see both SEVEN & THE GAME as soon as you can!!
4,Great movie....bad DVD,"I love the film, the problem is the DVD is not anamorphic or enhanced for widescreen 16x9 televisions or projectors, so the image has to be manipulated to make it. It's very disappointing."
1,The Movie Is Great..However...,"First of all, ""The Game"" is an awesome and exciting thriller of a movie. I highly recommend checking it out.However..I purchased this movie for a hearing impaired relative of mine based on the fact that Amazon's Product Details description CLEARLY states..Subtitles: English, Spanish.There are in fact NO English subtitles, but only Spanish. And my relative now has a movie that is totally useless to her!I think Amazon needs to print their product details based on correct facts so that other buyers won't make the same misinformed mistake."
5,The Game (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray],What a fantastic movie! I've been waiting for a loaded version of this to come out on dvd. The bare bones dvd that was already out had no extras to speak of. The Criterion edition was definitely worth the wait.
4,David Fincher's 3rd Best Movie!,"A very cool suspense movie starring Michael Douglas. It is about a rich business man (Michael Douglas) and his brother (Sean Penn) wants to give him a gift of a real-life game that takes place in the real world. But when it gets too hard to take , and Michael Douglas is being hurt , and starts to suspect this is real life , all hell breaks loose. Is someone trying to kill him or is someone playing a horrible trick on him. Watch it and find out. Starring: Michael Douglas , Sean Penn , Debroah Unger , James Rebhorn and Peter Donat..."
4,"Fincher's intriguing ""The Game"" will pull you in!","Michael Douglas was in 2 unique films during the '90s I believe, ""A Perfect Murder"" and ""The Game"" by director David Fincher (Seven;Social Network;Curious Case of Benjamin Button) but only ""Murder"" scored at the box office which really mystifies me because the second film is unconventional and original at the same time. Douglas of course seems to enjoy playing a seemingly unlikeable character in both films but in ""The Game"" he finds himself in a web of contradictions. Perhaps the unconventionality of the film turned off Douglas fans and they opted for the former but if you like your intellect and senses challenged, do check out this original film. A fine supporting cast includes Sean Penn as his brother, Phillip Baker Hall and Deborah Kara Unger."
4,The Game,"Bit of an oldie, so I think we have all watched it before. A rich man getting involved in a game, that has so many twists and turns, you can't work out how it is going to end. But I must admit you are not let down when the film does end. I like most of Michael Douglas films so this one is no exception, so I would certainly recomend this one."
5,Another Great Douglass Film,"I thought that this movie was great! I really loved it. Douglass has done it again, without him, this film would be terrible. I know that a lot of people hated this movie, like my friend. But do you know what his favorite movie is? ""The Avengers"" possible the worst movie ever made. The people who made ""The Avengers"" were just wasting time, money, and video's to record onto. If your a fan of Douglass then rent or buy this movie. You wont be dissapointed."
5,Standing Ovation - BRILLIANT !!!,"I burst into spontaneous applause at the end of this film because there is not a film out there like it, none. The truth may well be out there, but films of this calibre aren't. You are always lost, double guessing yourself and then double guessing yourself again. There are clues everywhere and yet no where. I love, love, love this film. I haven't seen the alternate ending but am looking forward to. Get this film you'll be glad you did."
5,"This movie was simply put, amazing...","This movie was great, very intense and mind boggling. its well worth it to buy it."
2,Not worth playin,"This film is a trite 90's foe-thriller that completely abandons plausibility. The script is terrible, but the acting and directing are great. It's still barely able to save this story at all. Pass if not for the Fincher completists. The writing team also penned the last two Terminator movies and Catwoman."
2,Cruel,"I agree with the viewer from San Diego. This film is very cruel and demonstrates the makers' deep contempt for humanity. I hope making this movie was cathartic for the director, writer et al because I'd hate to think of them walking around with such a perspective."
2,Good idea -- Horrible film,Oh paleease --- Stop with the BS this film throws at you. C'mon now. Who is this director anyway ?? This guy is known for Seven and Fight Club ??Seven and Fight Club were much much better than this piece of overhyped trash!Spare yourself the viewing of this film.
4,"Finally, 4 star for the movie. Hopefully the blu ray will be the same.","I got the HD DVD of this long time ago and it was mediocre.This was teased awhile back and I totally forgot about it until about 10 minutes ago while browsing through Criterions site hoping to come across a hint for Rian Johnson's ""Brick"". The Game happens to be in my top 10 of all time and top three Fincher films along with Social Network and Se7en. Really looking forward to this. And it happens to take place in one of the greatest cities on the planet!"
2,A Teaser of a Thriller,"This particular movie was the first that I could remember that its climax would be the downfall of the movie. Director David Fincher delivers a suspense thrill ride of a movie which has enough twists to keep you guessing until the movie ends. Michael Douglas gives his usual believable outstanding performance as a cold control freak who's reality is turned upside down after an intriguing gift to play a ""game"" by his brother(Sean Penn). All the elements of a true psychological thriller are here but that is all that this movie ends in having: just elements. The story builds such high power tension and suspense that that to have the climatic resolve it offers as a finale is almost downright insulting. If this were a porn movie, the climax would disappoint all viewers. Suggestion: Michael Douglas has plenty of movie hits to see....I'd skip this one."
1,Too Slow.,This movie was very slow and very difficult to understand the actual plot. I fell asleep within the first half hour of the movie.
4,Outstanding story line,"well written story with twists and surprises throughout. Michael Douglas and Sean Penn lead us to a grand finale. Michael Douglas plays his somewhat typical ""Rich Guy"" role - and plays it well. Penn is perfect as the shady brother."
4,Love This Movie!,This movie has more twists and turns then a snake. One of Michael Douglas' best films and same can be said for Sean Penn. The scripts for this movie is brilliant and this movies is SO fast paced. It's a masterpiece. Love it!
4,Great movie,"I've enjoyed many movies by the Douglas clan over the years, and this one was no exception. It kept me guessing until the end, and even then I needed to watch it again. Don't let someone tell you the ending! The whole concept being depicted was a new experience to me. I enjoyed the acting, drama, etc."
5,SUPERB!!!!!,"I have watched a lot of films in my time, in a lot of diffent genres. This was the first film in a long time that had me glued to the screen. The only other newish film i can think of that had that affect was 'The 6th Sense' or perhaps 'Momento' both excelent films. Douglas is superb as a very rich man who is bought a birthday present by his younger brother. This present is meant to bring some ""fun"" into his life, but hew gets a lot more than he bargained for! Brilliant entertainment for all, a MUST watch!"
1,"Crazy movie, no rules","The movie keeps you guessing, right up until the end. The end reveals just how baseless the movie is. Think about it....the movie is based on something that simply put, would never happen, not even a chance. Again, what are the odds that a guy trapped in a taxi cab that goes over a seawall, survives?....same guy falling many stories......survives? Happy birthday??? Awful, insulting. Sick."
1,Absolutely Awful !!,"Very far-fetched, even for a movie... Insults the average man's intelligence, need not say what it does to the intelligence of a thinking man...Michael Douglas is probably the only positive aspect of this otherwise silly film. Maybe if viewed by an audience of bright-eyed, gullable, 12-year olds, the movie would reach it's full potential with it's so-called surprises.I must honestly say this picture was one of the biggest dissapointments I have witnessed, considering I was looking forward to an excellent thriller, but what I got was a goofy, rediculous fantasy...For anyone contemplating a purchase, please consider renting first. Then, after you view ""The Game"", you will understand why any truly intelligent person would NOT make this a purchase...What an awfully overrated movie !! Shame on you silly little people behind this picture for thinking you could get away with trash like this. Adios !"
1,This is Only My Opinion,"Poor Nicholas misses the breakaway glass and goes SPLAT!! Just like daddy.Conrad finally realizes what a sick, sadistic fool he is, and plummets himself down after. SPLAT!!The ridiculous CRS crew throw their hands in the air in unison and exclaim, ""This wasn't OUR fault, we were just doing our jobs!!""The movie set is suddenly invaded by Storm-Troopers, who proceed to open fire with their blasters, killing anyone who was paid to take part in this asinine game, including David Fincher.Now THAT would have been a good ending."
1,2nd attempt at saving the innocent...,"...as my first review, mysteriously, never appeared in the roster. Onward: Michael Douglas = worse actor than a trained monkey; hearing Sean Penn say ""touche"" is plain torture; how Fincher went from this atrocity to Fight Club, the best movie of 1999, is an enigma better left unexplored. On the whole, a film so flat as to be two-dimensional; it has no redeeming features, I assure you."
1,"Wow, I have never met anyone who actually liked this movie.","This movie is a flop, plain and simple. The acting is subpar, camerawork is shoddy, and the storyline is incomprehensible. Is there a movie that is more farfetched (besides the Da Vinci Code)? The ending is unbelievable, as in no one would believe that someone would actually go through all the trouble to play a prank on somebody like they did to Michael Douglas. It's hard to believe that famous actors like Douglas and Sean Penn actually signed on to this drivel. They must have liked the ""twist ending,"" that only was a twist because it made no sense. Seriously people, how could you enjoyed this movie?! It says it is a ""thinking-man's thriller."" What? The only thoughts I had was ""Whuhh?"""
1,Worst movie,"This is undeniably a bad movie. However, many people enjoyed it. I have no clue as to why. I know this one kid, whose obsessed with this movie. GET A LIFE, MAN! Truthfully, this movie was overrated, and Michael Douglas's worst film. If you're not particularly fond of movies with weak plots, extreme coincidences, and horrible endings, I recommend that you not waste your time viewing this terribly inept film. After all, you only live once, right?"
5,I can finally get rid of my LD,"This definitely lives up to Criterion's usual high standards, and it's nice to see all of the content from their original Laserdisc version coming over to the blu-ray. Absolutely worth the purchase if you're a fan of the movie or of David Fincher."
1,A painful viewing experience,"This has to be one of the most dreadful films I have even seen. The story is absurd, the charaters are completely repusive, and the ending is an insult to anyone with an IQ exceeding that of a turnip. The only conclusion one can draw from this film is that the director, the writer and the actors view humanity with absolute contempt."
3,What? No anamorphic format?,"I like this movie so much that I bought it in spite of the fact that it was not done in anamorphic (i.e. ""enhanced for 16x9 TVs"") format. I would give five stars to an anamorphic version. The ""full-screen"" version is of sufficient picture quality that it should be acceptable to anyone without a widescreen TV but the letterbox version makes me cringe (this DVD contains both versions). An HDTV or widescreen television owner may want to wait for a future anamorphic version."
3,A Definite Mind Game,"This movie is a definite mind game that keeps you guessing. Completly different than what I was expecting. A great movie if you like to be on the edge of your seat, but at the end you feel almost taken by the stupidity of the flick. I would reccommend to rent, but not to buy."
4,Wow?,The movie did take me for a loop. At first I really didn't know what the hell was going on. But little by little I kept shoving my seat closer to TV. Its a very great movie.
4,The Game,"Michael Douglas stars as Nicholas Van Orton in this great thriller. On his birthday, Nicholas younger brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn) tells him he should play a game. He is hesitant at first but goes thru with it and the movie really takes off from there with various twist and turns. The ending was a little over the top but doesnt take away from the movie. Douglas is great in the lead role and Penn does a good job as well. This is a must watch if you enjoy movies that keeps you guessing."
4,Under-rated!,"This is a wholly under-rated film! It's completely unpredictable, splendidly acted and keeps you guessing throughout. Loved it! This is a little talked about gem and Michael Douglas is fantastic."
2,Unmet Expectations,"The Game has the potential to be an exquisite thriller if it had remained the homage to revenge fantasies it started out being. However, towards the climax of the film, the rug is rudely ripped out from under the feet of the viewer as we are now treated to a film that decided to be a thinking man's thriller. In order for the Game to be a thriller, there would have to be genuine thrills instead of jaw-droppingly pallid scenes involving Douglas plunging to near-certain death only to ""miraculously"" survive. Apparently, the filmmaker has mistaken roller-coaster ride style shocks for thrills of a psychological bent.The pseudo twist ending made the film an incoherent mess and failed to invite the viewer to reflect at all. And I watched this film closely.In summary, the Game is an entertaining watch if its on TV for free and you've nothing better to watch."
2,Looks better in the pictures than in person,I would not purchase again. The fan for the price is very cheap quality construction. I have not been happy with the product and gave it away.
5,Jon Mark hit's the mark on this one,"I am a long time fan of Jon Mark & also Mark Almond for which he is a part of. This gem is not very well known but amazing! The songs are very pretty and melodic and the album is full of the remarkable sadness that sometimes adorns both Mark Almond and Jon Mark albums. Great music to spend a quiet candlelight evening with that special loved one. It is very romantic and classy. Title track ""Lady and the Artist"" and ""Stay"" are my favorites - remarkable piano work!!"
3,Some rare classics,"I bought this CD for a handful of particular songs, so its worth to me, if you're musically adventurous, like I am, go for it!"
4,Hidden No More,"The Hidden Zodiac is a very good astrology book. I had never heard of dwaads before in all my reading of the zodiac. It explained some of my personality that hadn't really been explained through my natal chart before. Although towards the end it got confusing and I felt the author's explanations weren't very good to figure out what you're supposed to do (hope I'm not the only one! :P), if you can finally puzzle it out, it's very interesting and informative. Other than that, which I suggest you be wide awake to read the end, past the Sun signs, I think it's a great book to find your hidden side!"
3,Not what I was hoping for,"As a homeowner/handyman/farmer I was hoping to find a book on the proper way to grade, dig, and slope using my compact utility tractor with loader and box scraper. In this regard I was disappointed, but a book to find what I am looking for has been impossible to find. I do think the book would be an excellent source of information for someone who is thinking about getting into this area of the construction trade- sort of a primer for the first-time construction (road work) worker."
5,good book for construction dirt crews,This book will help answer questions you might have aboutabout survey stakes ane plan reading. I reccommended to every operator outthere.
3,bad description,I did not know that the book was written in Spanish. I wish that it would have been described better.
4,Good read with my 6 year old,My 6-year-old enjoyed the cast and characters of Klikitat Street and all of the things that Henry gets involved in.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"A friend gave my 8-year-old this CD for his birthday. We had read it aloud about 2 years previously, but he didn't remember it. We LOVE this recoding. Neil Patrick Harris is a genius. Since then my son has requested each of the following books on audio from the library. (Note, not all are performed by Harris, but most are.) I recommend this to anyone with boys!"
5,Best Loved Childrens Story,My mother read Henry Huggins to me as a child and I read it to my children. Now I'm a school librarian and I recommend it to the children in my library. This book leaves you with the feeling all is right with the world. And you will laugh!
4,Henry Huggins,Henry Huggins is a boy that lives with his mom and dad in a house on a street called Klickitat Street.Henry is a ordinary boy that nothing excited ever happens to him except when he was 6 years old he broke his arm by falling out of the cherry tree. When Henry goes downtown to swim at the Y.M.C.A he finds a dog thta he wants to keep and then his life changes when he has that dog as his pet. He relizes how pet are important and hard to takt care of.He needs full responsibilities to take care of his dog named Ribsy.
1,Beware of Manufacturing Error! Adult material on first disc!,"I ordered this Henry Huggins CD for a long car ride with my children. If you did, too, make sure you preview the first disc! The copy I received was appropriately labeled ""Henry Huggins,"" but the material on disc one was NOT FOR CHILDREN. I listened to enough of it to research the source. It begins with the chapter titled ""That's Amore"" from the book ""When You Are Engulfed by Flames"" by David Sedaris. The themes and language in this book are adult. Amazon kindly exchanged my defective CD set with a new one .... AND IT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM! Buyer beware."
1,Henry Huggins...sample.,This sample only shows the introduction! Where's the chapter 1? This sample needs to be extended; there's no storyline.
4,She Lives in a Time of Her Own,"The dream-pop on ""Bozo"" prefigured the kind of music Beth Orton (post-Chemical Brothers) and Lori Carson (post-Golden Palominos) would be making only a few years later but--unfortunately--to less acclaim. Like those singer/songwriters, Husik wraps her pleasing, dusky voice around off-kilter lyrics, buffeted by hazy guitars, percussive beats, and the occasional organ bleat. On some songs, such as ""Hateful Hippy Girls,"" she appears to have been possessed by the spirit of ""Hyaena""-era Siouxsie, singing in a lower register over musical backing that sounds vaguely sinister. The highlight of the set is the trippy ""Farmhouse,"" which samples surly, raspy-voiced bartender Louis ""Red"" Deutsch of Tube Bar fame (""Who you wanna talk to?! Who you wanna talk to?!""), basis of a long running routine on ""The Simpsons."" Shimmy Disc founder Kramer (Bongwater) produced the recording with his trademark airy, atmospheric touch."
3,Not the best Icelandic saga.,"This volume is comprised mostly of the Islendinga Saga, which is very long and repetitive as compared to other Icelandic sagas. If you have already read all the other, more popular, sagas, then go right ahead and read this one. Not recommended for newcomers to saga literature, however. There is some very interesting detail about conflicts with a Christian bishop, but this can be gotten in a more succinct and readable form in volume 2 of this translation."
5,Islamic Book Trust edition vs. Fons Vitae edition.,"I bought both editions of the 'The Road to Mecca.' The edition published by Fons Vitae is printed on higher quality paper and has an attractive cover. However, one of the photos is missing in this edtion that was in the original edition of the book. Also, another of the photos is mis-titled. So, the buyer should be aware of this discrepancy.The edition published by Islamic Book Trust has all of the photos that were in the original edition, and the photo captions are all correct. However, the quality of the paper is not very good, and the binding is not as high a quality.Again, the buyer should be aware of this discrepancy between the two editions."
5,Thank You Asad,"I wish I had read it earlier. This book was an eye opener. I have learnt so much from it. Not only is it a beautiful sprirtual journey it is also a pleasurable use of the english language. Makes one wonder why his works are not known more. Thank you for the wonderful gift to us Asad, May Allah bless your soul"
4,nice book,"nice book about one of Islam pillars. i recommend it for muslims and none muslims, everyone would enjoy this book."
3,"Hippie romance, Austro-Hungarian style","A Jew from Austria-Hungary may have more than the usual reasons to hate his own culture, but even if you are not a Jew in early 20th century central Europe the attraction exerted by noble savages is undeniable (see Thesiger)..Hippies tend to fall for Tibetans, but Leopold fell for the Beduoin..Unfortunately, the romance died after Allah granted oil to the beddus and they decided they preferred the life of well fed parasites to the noble and hungry life of the desert but by then Leopold had also moved on to the more sophisticated and literate Islam of the Islamicate empires. An interesting journey. Worth a read."
2,not easy enough to learn quickly,"too complicated to learn quickly in a session. too many steps , directions, etc. cute idea though. colorful and good quality of the cards."
5,"Fun, very easy to learn, fast paced game","This is a nice card game for girls 7 and up. It features 4 equestrian themed 'events' (Jumper, Hunter, Equitation, Dressage) - and the object is to collect blue ribbons. Players take turn alternating who hosts a show - and depending on the number of players, there will be 3-4 events per show. Certain horses in your hand will have a better chance than others in certain shows - and some horses have penalties for a particular ribbon. There is a bit of strategy - but not so much that younger children are at a disadvantage against older kids or their parents.My daughter really likes the horse theme and the cards have lovely images on them. In all, we greatly enjoyed this game!"
5,fun game!,"I have three daughters who show horses, ages 8-14. This game has been so much fun for the entire family to play together - its simple enough that everyone can quickly understand the rules, but also uses strategy, so there is some higher thinking that can happen while playing as well. I definitely recommend for horse enthusiasts!"
3,"Why is it ""homemade""?","Do the workers live at the plant? At least they don't stick their hands in the vats in order to justify calling it ""hand made""."
4,A Good One Act,"I first saw this piece done in a community theatre workshop and loved it. To span an entire character's life and still be witty and not preachy is a tough assignment but Elaine May has done it here. As a word of warning, I would not suggest any novice actors try this piece as it requires only four actors to play NUMEROUS roles."
4,Reissue of LP's,"Nice redo of LP's - good sounding tracks, BUT the CD boxed set did not include the diagrams. Includes all volumes of Play Guitar with Ventures, 1,2,3,4 & 7. In case you are wondering the Ventures did not do volumes 5 & 6. Those volumes were done other artists, Chet Atkins and some else I am not familiar with."
1,many words with little meaning,"I don't know who the authors thought the target audience for this book is, it's defenetively not me. Why I have to read about 'dealing with clients' in a book supposedly about design concept, I don't know. And what I gain by reading broad statements like 'clients like to talk about their company' is a mystery to me, too. There are several areas in the book where the authors are simply wrong.It's true what they say: If you're not good at something, teach it."
3,Get the right size,"These flippers work great, except for the fact that they are sized very small, so when you order, do order one size larger than you normally wear."
1,I dont received eat!!!!,"Soil Mechanics In Engineering PracticeDears, I dont received the book eat!I still hope a feedback this week.Thks"
3,Soil Mechanics Bible,"This is the bible of soil mechanics. Only downsize the book is so compacted. I wish the book had more example problems. I have also other soil and foundation books, I will just keep this book as a reference."
1,It different than the US version,I found that the Internationale edition that I ordered is very different than the US edition. and I don like the printing in some pages there was underlining and some unclear paragraphs.Ahmed
5,most fantabulous tasting tea ever!!!,"this is my favorite tea in the whole world. i had some friends who claimed they didn't like green tea--until i brewed them some of this. now they are hooked, too :)"
3,"Green - Yes, Jasmine - No","This is good tea. I like the individual tea bag wraps because it keeps it very fresh. I love the taste of the green tea in this product but the Jasmine is lacking. There's a slight Jasmine presence but not that lush, full bodied Jasmine taste and smell. I once had the best Jasmine tea at a local downtown Los Angeles dim sum restaurant and have been searching for that taste ever since. If anyone has a Jasmine tea recommendation I'd sure like to know about it."
1,So disappointed they changed the recipe!!!!,"This has been my all time favorite decaf green tea. Love the lemon grass and very subtle sweet smell and flavor.I only recently discovered how great it is to buy via Amazon! I bought bulk pacakged tea boxes this past summer and recently ran out. I noticed different packaging and assumed that it was still my very favorite tea. NO NO NO they changed the recipe and the flavor lacks everything I used to love. I keep sniffing my hot mug looking for that aroma I love.BIG BUMMER as I have 6 boxes I will have to use, but it will no longer be my first choice when I want a yummy cup of tea. BRING BACK THE OLD RECIPE!!!!!"
1,What kind of tea is this?,"I got excited when I saw this in the tea collection at work. Jasmine Green Tea? I love Jasmine Green Tea! So I had a cup ... and it was awful. I thought maybe I somehow had a bad cup, so I tried a different tea bag ... yuck.It's hard to describe just how bad this tastes. Imagine a cup of green tea that someone poured some jasmine-scented perfume into. Or maybe dissolved some jasmine-flavored candy into. I saw someone say it was Pez flavored, and I can agree with that. But no matter how you describe it, it is undrinkable. Second cup was poured down the sink.And it isn't just the initial taste. Somehow this coats your tongue and the badness sticks with you. I suspect this box is going to be sitting around the office for a long, long time."
4,Smells Wonderful and It's Organic,"The Good Earth Organic Jasmine Blossom Green Tea is quite nice for what I like to call ""supermarket tea"" standards. It smells wonderful and the taste is good compared to many other green teas sold on supermarket shelves. I have tasted better, though (Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Jasmine is excellent!).Still, for the price this is a nice tea and I would buy it again."
1,NEW IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER,"The addition of Lemongrass with the Green Tea had always made this my favorite of all green teas I have ever had. I couldn't wait to brew it and smell the amazing aroma as well as enjoy the taste. It was my comfort tea. But the tea has changed. And I can't get used to the new taste. It just does not satisfy like it did.Good Earth Green Tea Lemongrass, Tea Bags, 20-Count, Boxes Net Wt 1.3 Oz (Pack of 6)"
2,Gave away most of it.,"I really wanted to like this tea, but I just couldn't. It has a slight sour taste. I had to give away most of the boxes I ordered. Oh well! Lesson learned - don't buy bulk tea if you haven't tasted it before!"
5,Best Ever Jasmine Green Tea!,This is a wonderfully flavorful Organic Jasmine Green tea - the best I've every tasted! I buy it in bulk to share with others who also get hooked on it!
2,This Does NOT Taste Like Jasmine Green Tea!,"This smells like jasmine green tea somewhat, but it gives off an odor more akin to cheap jasmine perfume. It dominates the palate, with its too sweet scent which unavoidably come through with the taste of this tea. I love a good cup of jasmine tea and I have tried many of them. This does NOT taste like any of the quality jasmine green teas I have had before. I got this because I thought it would be an easier way to brew tea at work instead of the loose stuff. Boy what a mistake. I now have a box of this stuff, minus one tea bag, sitting in my desk never to be used. If you enjoy quality jasmine teas, do not get this tea!"
3,Orange flavor too strong,"The orange oil is quite dominant in this tea. I don't feel the flavors blend well. I much prefer Good Earth's Green Tea with Lemongrass, where the flavors are more subtle."
3,Not reg decaf green tea - has lemongrass,Ordering online is confusing - I did not realize it had Lemongrass in it until I opened the box - I have allergies to Lemongrass. They do offer a 'regular' green tea decaf
1,Odd flavor,"I bought this tea because it was the only jasmine tea my local store carried. I found the jasmine flavor odd, and when I looked at the Good Earth site, it failed to explain what the ""flavoring"" was. I would not buy it again, and discarded it because the flavor is odd and artificial tasting."
5,Refreshing,"This is awesome tea. I do not usually like any hint of lemon in my tea, however, this tea has changed my mind! For me, plain green tea is hard to drink. It taste's like mowed grass! So I choose green teas with other flavors added. This is one of the best IMO. I have not tried it iced yet, but think it would be equally as wonderful served that way. The tea stands on it's own& does not really need a sweetener, but a drizzle of honey really brings out the flavor!"
3,Not true Jasmine flavor,"I bought a box of this tea before I realized it was Good Earth brand. I have tried a few of their tea flavors much in the past, and there is something in the ambiguous ""natural flavors"" in their tea that I just don't like.That was the case with this ""Jasmine"" tea, as well. If you are looking for a clean and true jasmine flavor, DO NOT BUY THIS TEA! I would give this tea 1 star if I were rating it on the basis of the jasmine flavor alone. That said, when I drank the tea with no expectation of jasmine flavor, I found that I actually liked it!Overall, it's an ok tea. I probably wouldn't buy it again, though."
2,Green tea with Jasmine,"I will not order this tea again because I prefer the flavor of the green tea with Lemongrass.Good Earth Jasmine Green Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count, Boxes (Pack of 6)"
2,Mediocre tea with artificial flavors,"This tea was a disappointment - I love green tea with jasmine, but this tea has artificial flavorings added to it. Don't order it in bulk unless you have tried it before, or you may be stuck with 6 boxes of it like me. I tried to pawn off a box on my sister, but she won't drink it either. :S"
2,Doesn't taste right.,"I agree with a previous reviewer on the Pez taste. There are definitely some fruity hints here that do not belong to Jasmine Green. I bought this as I ran out of Jasmine Phoenix Pearl (loose) tea quite some time ago and wanted to get back into tea drinking with the colder weather upon us.This is unlike any ""green"" tea I've had.. it's like someone left a lollypop from Halloween in your cup for a minute. Fruity-fake. I don't like it at all. I'm looking for the strong presence of Jasmine flowers with a slight bitter after-taste associated with the tannins in the green tea. That is not here... slight green tea taste, fruity hints, no bitterness whatsoever. Very Disappointed.I feel GoodEarth is misrepresenting their product here. It clearly states ""Jasmine Green Tea"" and that is what I expect."
1,not what it used to be.....,"I have been drinking Good Earth green tea with lemongrass for years. I've always loved the special taste of it. BUT I have to say, I'm very disappointed in the new/latestGood Earth green tea. I tastes like flowers, of some sort. I am not a fan and I am stuck with 6 boxes of 20. UGH! I wish I knew in advance they changedthe flavor of the tea. I do not recommend trying. It is not at all like the previous tea."
5,Wonderful Tea!,I drink a cup of green tea everyday and I have tried many brands. The Good Earth Decaf green tea is by far the best tasting green tea. It has a hint of spice to it so it is not boring like many of the green teas I have tried. I am not going to search any further for a green tea because this brand is for me!
1,Failure To Mention Extra Ingredients On Box!!,"This product page lists as ingredients: Decaffinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors.But they have failed at listing ALL of the ingredients, which are the above AND rose petals, AND peppermint.Maybe not an issue to some (or most?) but was for me. Peppermint in my tea is unacceptable and is an important ingredient that should be disclosed. Shame on you Good Earth. Because of this, I got a refund from Amazon and will never buy another one of your products online (maybe I'll try you out after I'm able to physically see the box and ingredients myself in a brick & mortar store, but for now you are a big FAIL.)I asked the Amazon rep to please alert Good Earth of this oversight, so if you're reading this and see that they've added the rose petals and peppermint to their list of ingredients, it was done after my call and this review :)"
4,The Second Little River Band Album,"The original After Hours album was arguably along with the debut album the finest produced by LRB. The album version released in the US (only??) was a hybrid of the third album Diamantina Cocktail and the Australian release version of After Hours. The hybrid and Diamantina Cocktail marks the beginning/ transformation /changeover of LRB to a middle of the road pop band and through the singing talents of the band some ""average"" songs were made distinctive, and with Reminiscing, one of the most ""played"" songs of all time, quite outstanding."
5,Awesome,This is an awesome book to help study for your CMT. I am finished with the study guide for work and using this book to keep me from forgetting what I need to know for this exam.
4,Fantastic way to learn medical terminology,"I bought this book because I am taking a medical terminology course online. I really like the way this book is laid out, how it teaches. You learn the roots and suffixes and prefixes of the words - not just the word itself. This way you can look at almost any word and figure out what it means because you know what each part of the word means. I would recommend this book, but you might want to build up your wrists first - my wrist is sore from lugging this HUGE book around - but it is worth it!"
4,"Another swift, breezy novel","I love Griffin's writing, and I love this Badge of Honor series. This is the sixth book in the series, and by now I'm getting to know Matt, Peter, Jason and the boys pretty well. I do not recommend reading this book as a stand alone book. It is much better as part of a very entertaining series. Most of Griffin's magic comes from his character building, and it takes time to get into the lives of the wonderful characters he creates. This book is also leaving a very large stepping stone into the next book, so I can't wait to read that one. Griffin opens the door with a glimpse into the world of cop corruption. In this book we also see Matt coming of age a bit as he experiences some truly tragic events. This is an excellent series, and one that I am enjoying mightily."
1,2 stars for Kindle Edition because of serious problems,"""The Murderers"" doesn't read well as a standalone, only as a part of the ""Men in Blue"" series, where it develops the series characters in context of previous books in the series.In addition, there is a serious problem with the Kindle edition: important - if not vital - to understanding the plot are graphic reproductions of a dozen or so police department incident, interview and forensic report forms, and these are all unreadable on the Kindle.Apparently this is another case of publishers mindlessly converting books for the Kindle without paying any attention to whether the content is all actually accessible to the buyer. This despite the fact that there are formats for the Kindle that can solve many of the problems of displaying graphic content, including the ability to ""zoom"" in on graphics. (A number of amazon.com blogs have the same problem.)So don't buy the Kindle edition, get the paperback."
5,Love WEB Griffin,I love all of the WEB Griffin Books and had read them years ago. Since I got my Kindle I am trying to buy and read the books in order. I still have a long way to go for all of the different series.
2,So So,"A good book for Jesuit leadership tenants, theory, and origins, but my exposure was in its use as a main text book for a graduate leadership course. If you have zero interest in hypocritical religious sects, then don't waste your time getting frustrated here. An organization that preaches a pursuit of equality yet does not allow membership into their 'brotherhood' to women speaks volumes about these people and the larger church that they are a part of.If you have a genuine interest in the Jesuit pillars of leadership, then there may be no better book."
2,good but,"this book has some good points about the Jesuits leadership but it was repetitive and i could categorize it as one of the most boring books that i read, there is a lot of fluff to be cut"
3,Not the same as Image,"The product I received was not the same as the image provided. I got a one piece log that was hollow. It was not shaped in any form that resembles the image at all. I was still able to make it useful by breaking it into pieces. If I wanted a log, I could have gone to my local home improvement store. The item you receive should be similar to the picture, this is false advertisement."
4,"Nothing too fancy, but...","I bought this book for my husband who is a very picky eater, and who will turn anything into a sandwich. I thought that this book would help make some interesting and fun recipes that I could enjoy as well as he could. A lot of the recipes are very basic, but there are also a lot of good ideas. I would recommend this item, but not at full asking price...I would definitely buy it from a private seller!!"
1,Yawn,You already know or have these recipes unless you are 9 years old and in which case you shouldn't be allowed near a stove or hot pan.
5,Yum!,Some of the most delicious grilled cheese sandwiches and quesadillas I've ever had. I use this book every weekend.
5,A cheese addict's bible,"The recipes are imaginative, the directions are clear, the results are sublime. My only question is, I look at her photograph and ask, how can the author look so slender?!"
4,Lots of ideas.,"Bought this for two reasons - an expanding cookbook collection and a daughter obsessed with grilled cheese sandwiches. Not disappointed. I could never have imagine the variety of cheeses, breads and ideas - have tried some of the suggestions and have not been disappointed yet."
5,Positive review,This book contains lots of great sanwich ideas. It's perfect for meals that need to be prepared in a hurry.
5,A River Dream by The Great ANJ (Aaron J),"Set the hook! Oh sorry, I did not see you there. That is one big rainbow trout! A River Dream begins with a boy name Mark who is sick in bed and cannot go outside. His Uncle Scott sends him a fly fishing box with all his best flies in it. When he opens it, all the flies fly out and head out the window. I love this book because I love to go fly fishing with my dad. I would think the theme is sometimes dreams can feel like real life. Well that's all folks and if you like to fly fish and like happy endings, I recommend this book. Hey are you going to keep the trout? No, I like to leave the river the way it was. by The Great ANJ (Aaron J)"
5,"An accurate 320 page ""book report""","The best way to describe this type of book is to show you it's table of contents. I have taken the time to do this for you because I feel that after seeing the titles of the books that the author reviews in each chapter you WILL make the decision to buy this book.1-A Century of War2-Tragedy and Hope3-The Naked Capitalist4-The Tax-Exempt Foundations5-The Creature from Jekyll Island6-19847-Report from Iron Mountain8-The Greening9-The Politics of Heroin10-Final Judgment11-Dope Inc.12-Let's fix America!The author has researched the works of writers who are seeking to find out WHO is impoverishing us, and WHY and HOW they are doing it. The findings are presented via a series of in-depth reviews of a carefully selected set of books, mostly little-known but a few famous. Taken together, a coherent picture emerges which precious few among even our political activists understand or care to admit to knowing."
3,Very interesting compilation,"I started to read this book and found it quit interesting, but I reached a point where I began to get sick of all what's around us. If you are really prepair to receive bad news about our world, then read it, I guess some ligth can blind people's eyes.There still is a remaining question I haven't found anywhere, ""Why"" why so much power, money, how did we reach this point. It really seems to me we are living just as the slaves did 4500 years ago in the ancient Egypt, with the difference we have more ""rights"" and less mysticism."
5,HOW THE WORLD REALLY WORKS,"This book is a must read for those who operate ""in the spirit of trust."" Before reading this book, I wrote a book published in late 2001 called ""Blacks In The Spider's Web"" which substantially views the world as the subject book, but from a black American perspective. Although I have not read all of the books reviewed in ""How The World Really Works"" (I'm sure most are out of print now), my analysis of the world situation corresponds materially with Alan B. Jones' book. Much of what we see of the world is a false facade that must be pierced in order to come to the reality of the truth. ""How The World Really Works"" helps to pierce the veil of secrecy covering the ""military industrial complex,"" the ""Kennedy assassinations"" and the ""dumbing down of America,"" among other ""unsolved mysteries."""
4,Good Reviews of selected Books,"I enjoyed the format and the books selected for review were mostly comprised of ones I would read. I used this book as a cross-reference to THE SHADOW OF POWER BY JAMES PERLOFF. Certainly for anyone researching history, this book is an excellent reference. The last book reviewed was the one which I found most disagreement. It is entitled: Let Us Fix America and was written in 1994, so Jones was not privy to our recent events. On the whole, I would recommend this compilation of book reviews without reservation."
5,Cliff Notes for the NWO,"A must read for everyone who wants to cut the strings of the puppet meisters. Stands on its own, and is a valuable reference. This book is a great launching pad for anyone becoming interested in why things are the way they are right now."
2,Brillant beginning then just plain disappointing.,Outdoing Stephen King's cameo in his Dark Tower series Bret Easton Ellis casts himself in the lead in his new book and finds himself a facinating character.The autuobiographical details are intriguing but as the psychological supernatural horror tale elements unfold it's all downhill from there.It turns silly and unfocused with echoes of other better creepy tales.Keen observations of living in a haze and witty moments aside the book turns into a dull mess.They say that truth is stranger than fiction and in this book maybe the writer would've been better off sticking to the truth and skipping the fiction.
1,Just awful,"Ellis turns into a cheap wannabe-Steven-King. A bad bad spine chiller (we are talking monster birds attacking the narrator in a haunted house), that has no literary depth whatsoever. Gone the days when Ellis actually had to say something about the state of society. If you are a die-hard Ellis fan (And I used to be! I read every one of his books), then spare yourself this one. It will just disgust you."
4,exellent beond belief!,"When I started reading this book it immediately hooked me in. I couldn't stop reading it, its was fascinating I especially enjoyed the part about Patrick making another masterpiece. This time at a motel. If you are reading this review and contemplating on whether or not you should read this book don't think reed its a great book filled with romance,deception,and murder. I especially like the demons."
2,i'm disappointed..........expectations were high,"Bret Easton Ellis is one of my favorite writers. All of his books (except THE INFORMERS) are brilliant. I got an advance reading copy of LUNAR PARK a few months ago. I'm so disappointed. The beginning and the end are AMAZING, but the rest is just a bad Stephen King novel. The whole middle section is extremely tedious, and honestly, pretty dumb. For this we had to wait seven years? What a bummer."
4,Shockingly good,"I had not previously been a Bret Easton Ellis fan. I read ""Less Than Zero"" when it first came out and thought it was over-rated. None of his subsequent books appealed to me until I read about the new one. I'm glad I overcame my prejudices.""Lunar Park"" is funny, scary and moving in equal measure. It can be enjoyed merely on its surface level, but it is much better appreciated as an allegory about family, failure and forgiveness.The only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think there is one significant gaping hole in the plot (unless I missed something). But even that flaw does not diminsh the entertainment value of the book or the profundity of the moving experience one will have from reading it and, even more, thinking about it after its ended.I am even inspired now to read more of Mr. Ellis's work."
1,Funny For All the Wrong Reasons,"Really? A killer Turby? An apology for American Psycho? This autobiographical farce is impressive only in the number of way it manages to fall off target on so many levels.If you're familiar with his earlier books, there are some nice continuity references and a few insights into how all the nonsense that is Brett's writing career started.If you're not familiar with Ellis, this isn't a good book to start with. If you're a fan, you know what you're getting yourself in to when you start reading this garbage....."
3,Not the Best,Bret Easton Ellis has said this was his finest novel but it's just sentimental. Some of it seems unnecessary but I'm sure the author knows what he's doing. For my tastes I preferred Less Than Zero and American Psycho.
5,5 Stars; aside from which a description eludes me.,"This is a tough one to describe, but it's my favorite Ellis novel. Ellis aims this story at the classic horror genre but keeps steering the wagon off the rails into postmodern metafiction, a weirdly false autobiographical indictment of his own celebrity image, and some Cheever-esque forays into modern suburban gothic. If you have a twisted sense of humor, many scenes are genuinely hilarious. Perhaps most importantly, Ellis visits the complex emotions and dynamics of father-son relationships many times and with great effect - building to a transcendent ending to a novel so bizarre it almost feels unfair. In this reviewer's opinion, Ellis pulls it off masterfully and I look forward to reading it again."
3,A flawed experiment,"The blurring of fact and fiction had me for a while, but so much of Lunar Park is just redundant. I found myself skimming a lot in the second half and often saying, aloud, ""Boring!"" and ""Stupid!"" Ellis's intentions and influences are perhaps more interesting than the book itself. Still, it made an impression. Just barely squeaks by to 3 stars."
2,Disappointed,"As a huge Ellis fan, I really wanted to like this book, and approached it with an open mind, despite having heard quite a few negative (as well as some highly positive) reviews from fellow Ellis fans.While the first chapter of the book (where Ellis recounts his own life and success) was captivating, I just found the rest dull and redundant overall. This is not to say that it doesn't have its merits - its account of suburban life is spot-on, and the book also gives you a glimpse into Ellis' inner world. For me, this last aspect alone made it worthwile to read, but after finishing the last page, I was missing that ""Oh my God..."", staring into space for long seconds moment that I got from his other works (Glamorama, Less than zero)."
3,Such potential wasted!!!,"Why Brett, why? This novel started off so well, it made me curious, it made me laugh out loud, and I was recommending it to people before I even finished. But then came that ending, that dreadful empty nothing of an ending! It was beyond cryptic; it was devoid of the answers I finished the book for in the first place. I actually had to come and read some reviews to see if I somehow missed something but apparently I didn't. Brett, you really should have sat on this one for another year until you had an ending that was worthy of the story."
2,Started with such promise,"The first chapter of this novel just sweeps you off your feet. It was so promising that I kept reading at breakneck speed hoping for the pay-off. Instead what I got was sleezy Stephen KIng rip-offs. Oh how sad that such a talent went for potboiler instead of profound. Much like his alter-ego character, Mr. Ellis got lost instead of making the effort to be found."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I've never given a book a negative review, preferring to ""say nothing at all if you can't say something nice .."". This, however, was a truly awful book - one I am sure would never have been published if the author wasn't already Someone Famous. I've never read a novel and had to take so many breaks to puzzle over what in the world was the author trying to say; flipping back pages and rereading in the hopes that this (previously excellent) author was perhaps making sense after all. No dice. I had to laugh out loud when I saw that there were positive reviews comparing this effort to Lovecraft or Poe. The only ""dream-like"" quality this book had was that it is nightmarishly bad. It is self-indulgent, disjointed, disorganized, and poorly imitative of a half-dozen horror authors. Mr. Ellis has done himself, and his audience, a disfavor with this silly effort."
2,Can I Have My Money Back?,"I should have known better than to get this book, but I was told that I should ignore the fact that it was written by Bret Eason Ellis. How can you ignore that fact when the main character is Mr. Ellis himself? Unfortunately, Mr. Ellis continues to rest on the laurels of some overly-hyped books from almost 20 years ago. There is no reason to believe that he will ever be anything more than an average writer."
2,An author completely obsessed with himself (faults and all),I wanted very badly to like this book. The first chapter was excellent. There was so much promise. I even got excited when I found characters from the book with their own homepages. There are so many ideas that I love in this book that I was sad to see them wasted. It is intense and spooky... but thats about the only thing going for it. In total I found it to be a mess. There was no direction whatsoever. There was no character development (the main character is so frustratingly oblivious you will want to strangle him).With much of the books lifted from what I attribute to Stephen King novels and The House of Leaves by Danielewski I say read the originals. At least those writers are not completely full of themselves.
1,It just went on and on about nothing,"Whilst in San Francisco in 2005 was in a bookstore where Ellis read the first few pages of this book at a book signing. Now 3 years later after finally picking up a copy to take on holidays the great expectant read I anticipated never happened. The book just went on and on and never really went anywhere. Every page you turned waiting for the story to step to the next level,but it never does. Very disappointed."
1,don't waste your time,"Bret Eason Ellis' newest novel is a waste of time, paper and money. The ridiculousness of the plot line, the bloated egotism and the poor Stephen King rip-off used to gather incompatible story lines makes for a read that a high school English teacher would characterize as ""needing focus"".I think this book was an attempt at creating a modern day tragedy. Man fights inner demons. Man fights societies rules. Man fights pressures to be responsible to his family. Man fights, and fights and fights - to what end? Drug and alcohol abuse? A failure to reach any of his goals? Ok - then let that be the story as opposed to having to resort to absorb plot twists utilizing demons to try and pull divisive story lines together."
1,Ruined my view of him as an author with this drivel,"This book is SO BAD, and Ellis' writing is executed at such a low level that it is hard to even critique it; it would be like writing an in-depth review of a double cheeseburger at Burger King: it makes no sense.The intro is lazy, self-absorbed, and stupid. You did drugs, drank, wore fancy clothes, blah, blah,blah...: who cares?The middle picks up and the writing between Ellis and his female assistant is the most truthful emotional writing that Ellis has ever done, and then BAM!The book drops off as if Ellis was like , ""What can I do now, Knopf will pay me on delivery for this book, I'll toss some inane thriller story and call it surreal, yeah, that's it. I'm cool.""Utterly pathetic. And I hate saying that, because I thought American Psycho was one of the best books of the late 20th century.He really ruined my view of him as an author with this drivel."
1,Just Awful,"I wanted to put it down after 25 pages, but I kept reading in hopes that it would get better. It did, but it was still horribly unsatisfying, although it had some of the makings of a good read. The relationship development read like George Lucas dialogue, and the name-dropping ad nauseum and contextualized drug use were overdone.Read it if you're a big fan; otherwise, skip it."
1,Horrific,"I could not believe how bad this was. Intriguing premise that turned into nothing more than a bad drug trip. I kept waiting for the payoff at the end, which never came. Who cares. My first and last Ellis book..."
1,An object lesson on what drugs can do to a brain,"This book illustrates the effects of long-term drug and alcohol abuse far better than any lecture a parent can give. Mr. Ellis can't anymore distinguish between reality and the replays in his imagination. It's hard to feel compassion or even interest for someone who has lots of money and fame and feels so, so sorry for himself."
2,Disappointing,"The metafiction aspect of this work was about the only thing that kept me turning the pages to the end. As a long-time fan of Bret Easton Ellis, reading about the main character's outrageous life in the literary brat pack of the 90's was a fun romp, but the story itself was a bit tedious."
4,Worth It,"For a book that starts out with a pseudo autobiography, for a book that features a self-indulgent main character, for a book that draws its themes from a series of obvious inspirations (including Shakespeare), I was pleasantly pulled along. Unlike some of Ellis' other stuff, it was clear to me that the construction of the book was well developed and tightly layered. The tension builds slowly. The book dabbles in straight detective stuff, then veers gently (how is that possible?) into horror turf. Yet when the blood comes, it seems even more real, even more damaging, even more of a catharsis. If you can't get past the self-centered main character, put the book down. If you feel yourself surprised to be with this guy for so long, keep reading because the end is worth the trip."
3,"Starts off with a bang, slows to a whimper","The first thirty to thirty five pages are everything an Ellis fan could possibly want but the novel slowly devolves into a horror story that, unfortunately, fails to captivate. I've read every one of his novels to this point, with Less than Zero and American Psycho two of my favorite books of all time, but this book, while I eagerly anticipated it, is just not up to those standards. It is a different novel altogether in that it is not a social commentary and is decidedly more personal and I'm not against this new direction for Bret, every artist and writer must evolve, but this is just not a great book. If you are a fan, you must pick this up, but if you are just a casual reader Bret has better books."
1,Lame.,"I was so relieved when I found this book by Ellis at an obscure airport gift shop with no other book options. I was excited to read something on the flight & to really get into a book. I typically have enjoyed Ellis' ideas & his style of writing. However, this book seemed to me to be written as some sort of lame joke. I do not think that Ellis spent a lot of mental energy developing characters or thinking out the plot. It read like a B rated thriller, & a bad one at that. I almost wonder whether he wrote this book to meet contractual obligations of a book contract. Check it out from the library or borrow it from a friend."
2,Autobiog only good part,This book is great if you want to read a rejected Stephen King novel. nuff said
3,"Interesting, but did I actually LIKE it???","Brett Easton Ellis doing what he does best: social commentary with a plot which twists and turns, and rants and raves, and gets bloody and gory and disgusting in parts... it definitely made me dizzy but did I like it? Still not sure. This one is more intellectually challenging than his previous novels and I couldn't put it down while I was reading it, but I doubt I'd ever want to read it again."
3,Aight,"Ellis a great writer with a fantastic way with words, but Lunar Park is not his best work. It's definitely a fast entertaining read, due mostly to his excellent style and dark, witty descriptions of the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. Whether living it up in the city or trying the family thing in the burbs, Ellis really knows how to portray depressed drug-using sex-obsessed Americans trying unsuccessfully to fill a void in their godless lives.However, the whole horror story haunting theme as a metaphor for the past gets tired and the book starts to lose steam toward the end. Not to spoil anything for you, but once the ghostbusters show up, you know Ellis was running out of ideas. Still it was a ""fun"" read with some good ideas that could have been carried out a bit better.Oh and as a bonus, this book contained only one gaping anus!"
3,Introduction great - downhill from there...,"The introduction was stunningly great, the way Ellis barreled through his metoric rise and into his drug impaired soft middle age lost years got me excited for the rest of the book. It seemed like Ellis had shaken off the haze of Glamorama and was ready to dive head first into an amazing piece of literature. Then the rest of the book happened.A horror novel that was not scary, a suspense novel that was not suspenseful.Basically, blah.You know it's bad when you start reading about a book Ellis the character in Lunar Park is writing called Teenage Pussy and you find yourself wishing you were reading that book instead of Lunar Park.That about sums it up."
5,Good powerful saw,"After I received it, fully charged the battery, put to use right away. It works very well, the weight of the saw works to your advantage and makes it more stable. One charge is good enough for my whole small-medium job."
2,Not what I expected!,Works well for very short period of time. Battery runs low too fast. Not as powerful as expected.Wouldn't recommend for a remodeler!
5,Well worth the money,"I've gotten a lot of good use from this. My only complaint is that when the battery starts to die, it cuts pretty poorly. But as long as you keep the battery charged up, it is great. I got my money's worth and more."
3,"Great tool, Sub-standard battery life","My husband and I bought this for my father-in-law as an early Christmas present. He loves it -- but the battery life is crap. If you're using this for weekend projects, you should be fine. My father-in-law has a farm and this saw gets used a lot. We were there over Thanksgiving and I was using the saw. Longest battery life we got out of it was about 2 hours. And that's after being fully charged.If you're a ""power user"" -- definitely buy an extra battery."
5,Look Out Trees,"I have all of the main Dewalt battery tools you would want and this is the one with the most uses for me. I've been using it about 17 months now and it works great. It cuts wood with ease in hard to reach places or if you just want to say, Get Out Of My Way. It has long or short blades for different situations. Metal cutting blades to get rid of that pesky nail in your way or cut a pipe in half. You can use it like a saber saw in a pinch. I use mine the most though to trim trees. It's just the cats meow. Much safer and cheaper to run than a chain saw. Much less effort than a hand saw and will cut up to about a 5 inch branch with the long blade inserted. Love it !!!"
1,Very poor quality,"I bought this TV in Feb 2006. It had bad bowing problems and had to be replaced two weeks after purchase. The replacement TV also had bowing problems and Samsung finally got around to sending me a tech in Feb 2007 to repair it. Now it is Aug 2007 and out of warranty. The TV has shut off completely and does not turn on. I called Samsung and they told me that since it is out of warranty I am responsible for it. Their customer service is not helpful at all, kept me on hold for hours, and transfered me to different departments. Finally, their customer relations executive told me she was tranferring me to senior management. A week later when I called to follow up, I found she had lied and closed the case.How do they sell a $800 TV that is so bad, and follow up with customer service that is dishonest? I guess this is the last time I will buy a Samsung product."
3,Had Trouble with this Purchase,"I think I would have a totally different experience in buying this TV if I had not bought it from Tech for Less. The TV arrived damaged but I thought it was a good looking TV, especially for the money. I liked the crisp picture and the size of the screen. There was a haze on the top left corner, but that was due to the damage sustained in shipment.I regret I had such a bad purchase experience and I still don't have a replacement TV but was afraid to try to buy on Amazon again. It was the first time I was buying a big ticket item.Samsung 30-inch Widescreen Slimfit CRT HDTVI think the TV, if it could arrive in better packing, would make someone happy."
4,Audio Rack Necessity,"These headphone hangers are exactly what I've been needing for my rack for years. Instead of just laying expensive headphones on a table, hanging them on a mic stand (where they fall off), or worse yet lying them on the floor, this hanger screws right into your rack for a safe place to store headphones. My small complaint, there aren't enough threads to be able to use it in place of a rack screw that secures your rack gear in place, so you have to use a free screw hole. Note that the ""HH2"" is an angled head phone hanger, not like the straight one pictured by amazon. The straight hanger is the ""HH1""."
4,Defy,"Thought this movie was pretty awesome. Wish it was 2 or 3 hours long though. I love wakeboarding so I love anything that involves wakeboarding but I thought they could of done the movie a little better to appeal more to mainstream to maybe get them more interested in wakeboarding. I kind of like that it isn't a mainstream sport but it does suck when you can't really watch tournaments or anything on tv or satellite and there aren't as many cable parks in the U.S. because of it. Anyway, it was a great movie to me and I love all those riders so I could watch stuff like this all day long."
5,Slaying it,The video Defy is considered by me to be the best wakeboard movie of it's kind. It is fast paced but grounded in the stunning cinematography and out of this world style. Danny Harf is one of the top names in the sport and watching this opens people's eyes to the sport of wakeboarding in a wave of progression not seen commonly in wakeboard videos. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
5,The holy grail of tone pedals...,"This is one of the greatest tone pedals out there. It is made by Ibanez, and was invented by Maxon. I bought one about a year ago, and I ALWAYS have it turned on in my setup, no matter what I'm playing. It has a level control, tone control, and drive control. I find that you get better tones if the level and tone knobs always stay up. With the drive set to zero, you can get a very 70's tube-ey Hendrix sound. With the drive all the way up you can keep that creamy tone that is so pleasing to the ears, and have that edgy fuzz. You can play so many things on here. It's a reissue, but it is reissued just the the originals with an old power supply jack. It's the one eighth inch size, but it comes with a free adaptor for this. It is simple, and very sturdy.The sum it up, it is an american classic, a must have. Stevie Ray Vaughn used it, and so many more american guitar icons. I live by this pedal."
5,Tube Screamer Gift,I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it. He had been wanting one since he read an article in Guitar Player magazine. It does everything he wants it to do. The transaction was handled quickly with no problems. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
2,business cards won't fit,A standard business card will not fit in any of the credit card slots except putting them in with the currency. That gets them dirty. The slots need to be about 1/4 inch longer
3,A Hard Read,If I knew it would be so difficult to read I would not have purchased it. I have not finished it. It will be the last book on my list to finish.
4,Forget the Brand name Hype,"Great for the price and delivery was fast, everything about doing business with this merchant seems right"
1,beware of second rate seller,Just received my products ...and they came in this little brown UNPADDED envelope!! This was the worst shipping job ever! And oh yea... the retract function for the cable isn't working!! LAME!
3,Not as good as the old one...,"It seems like most products are reducing their packaging, reducing the number of ounces for which we pay the same price, and otherwise cheapening their product at our expense. I've owned Norelco beard trimmers for as long as I've had a beard, which is to say most of my adult life and when my old one finally burned out, I replaced it with this one, which was, theoretically, the same design as the old. Not so much. The motor doesn't seem to be as powerful. It doesn't hold a charge (for something that's supposed to be ""rechargeable"") for very long. It trims well enough, but not as well as the old one. Not sure what or why they did whatever it is they've done to this trimmer, but it's more toy-like than tool-like. It works well enough. And I mean that as faint praise."
5,"Dependable, sturdy beard trimmer","Last year my trusty Philips Norelco T765 finally gave out. I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, but it fell apart on me in a few months. So I'm back to the T765. It does what it's supposed to do, it's well-made, and it will last!"
1,Weak,"The motor is weak, which means hair gets stuck in the blades rather than being nicely trimmed, and the battery life drops off after a few months to the point where the clippers need to be recharged after each use."
4,Excellent value,"This trimmer works better than most in all areas (esp. battery charge life!!!)the only downside i've experienced is that it tends to get clogged frequently and cutting efficency deminishes. so clean it as you use it, and all is well!Great product!"
2,"wide trimmer, does not do the job",the wide trimmer doesnt allow you to trim your mustache properly and does not cut evenly under the nose which is very annoying!! Also the blade level adjuster is sensitive and when your trimming a rough beard its hard to keep the setting on the same number. dont waste your time and your money.
2,Not as good as the older models with the pop out trimmer,This model is ok I guess but I really miss the pop out trimmer of the older model that eventually wore out after several years. Doesn't seem like the choices are that good any more and I would love to find an older Norelco model l ike I had. This model trims the beard ok but the head is too wide to do any detail work and the pop out trimmer was perfect for that. Replaced a Conair unit that had a bad habit of ripping my beard hair out though -- will never buy another Conair product.
4,Better than most new products,"I've had one these trimmers (a T860) for more years than I can remember, well 3 or 4. I finally had to replace it after it had lost too much power loss which I think is due more to the battery than the motor. I've had other Norelcos and had the same problem. I tried a new Norelco T980 trimmer to replace it. Well it has neat features but it wouldn't stay locked on the setting so I ended up having to trim at the lowest setting. Not cool. After 3 weeks of that I returned it & got a Panasonic All In One trimmer. I set it to one of it's 14 settings, applied normal pressure to the comb and same problem. LUCKILY I found a replacement for my old reliable and getting another one. I might buy 2! Word to the wise, if it ain't broke don't fix it!!!!!"
1,"Works okay, and then the battery goes",After just one year the rechargeable battery suddenly doesn't hold a charge. The battery is not replaceable. For my next purchase I'm staying away from Norelco.
3,Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer,Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer is not as good as Model T990.
2,Poor Quality,"This is the second beard and moustache timmer made by Norelco that I purchased but this one only lasted 6 months. I noticed immediately how much lighter this trimmer was compared to the older model I had. It must have been because of the all plastic insides since after ONLY six months the teeth that allow the trimmer to adjust broke and I had to throw it away. Guess, I should have opted for the more expensive model........ lesson learned."
1,Garbage,"I've had this trimmer for like 2 years and I only used it because I was too cheap to buy a knew one, however since it stopped working completely, now I have to get a new one. It wouldn't stay charged that long for one.For two, it just cut horribly. I wouldn't suggest this product to anybody. Hope this helps."
1,Poor Quality,I have to second all the writers who found this shaver to be much less than advertised. It stopped taking a charge about 6 months after I purchased it. It is truly underpowered and overpriced. Please stay away from it.
1,Junk,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I owned the previous model (T-760) and after about a year it became unchargeable. Looks like it's charging, but doesn't actually charge. Figured it was a fluke and bought another one a year ago and wallah! Same problem. However, this time, it doesn't look like it's charging. The light never comes on. I guess for 17 bucks, that's what we should expect."
3,Not bad with a battery upgrade,"Like the other users here, mine had limited battery capacity and after about 3 years was dead even after a charge. Opening it up, I expected to see more than the single AA rechargeable battery (and a very low milliwatt rating one at that). The Philips replacement battery is 6 dollars plus shipping.I replaced it with a generic AA rechargeable ($2.25) with 4 times the mw rating. Big improvement. I hate to throw stuff away without at least trying to fix it. This is a task anybody with a screwdriver and soldering gun can do."
2,battery/power issues,"I've owned this for over a year now, but I've only had a beard intermittently during that time. I'd say about 5 months worth of trimming.Well, like another user said, this thing was definitely under-powered from the start. And now, it has completely stopped working. It won't hold a charge at all. Even when it is plugged in, it's not receiving enough power to barely turn the motor. Even if I try to charge it for a full day, the battery won't get charged, the unit simply gets hot to the touch. Clearly some sort of defect with the power supply/battery."
1,"Underpowered Shaver, Cheap but Ineffectual","Second Norelco I purchased. The first one worked well, but died.Thinking they were the same product, I went w/ the T765 b/c I didn't need the ""side trimmer."" Waste of money. Go w/ the more powerful, yet expensive model."
2,Doesnt trim well and battery doesnt last,"If people with really good trimmers saw how I operated with this trimmer they'd probably laugh. You have to go over and over and over the same spot to cut your beard with any semblance of uniformity. Also you have to be careful to apply equal pressure each time or your cut could be spotty because of the spring loaded guide. Also as others have said if you want a close trim, you will probably end up looking like a bad joke with plenty of skin showing.The design is bad, and the battery croaked after a few years of use(while religiously following the use/recharge guide).Kind of annoying but probably for the best, since I can get a better unit now.When you look at the selection of 115-220 volt travel trimmers its no wonder that Norelco is producing garbage theres almost no competition. If any companies are reading this you have a wide opening to take on Norelco."
5,Hopelessly searching!!!!,"This is the best album Natalie put out in her entire career. This album brings back so many memories.I had the album and played it up until the early 90's.It was water damaged in a fire in my home and I've been searching for it ever since.Track #6 I Just Can't Stay Away is the sweetest melody ever heard, you can just feel the love in her voice,it jumps right out and grabs you;kinda makes the hair on your neck stand up.Also there is a track on there it goes ""I'm keeping a light shinining in the window, just in case he decides to come home."" I remember being a little girl and singing this song in a Thanksgiving family talent show!I was about 10 years old and I won $10.00 from all my uncles.If anyone out there have a copy please e-mail me @ FHatter513@aol.com,I'm willing to pay via paypal!!"
4,Want the DVD!,"I caught this on vacation, on Cable, which I do not have at home. I knew Gracie Allen was a GREAT comedienne, George Burns was the first to point that out, by giving her all the punch lines, because she was just better than anybody, including him! But I had never heard of DAMSEL IN DISTRESS. Everyone knows that Astaire was the greatest screen dancer ever, but Gracie blew me away in that Funhouse number, which is quite extended. Who knew Gracie could dance like that? Okay, a bit of Ginger would have spiced up the movie, but I found it a delight from beginning to end. Great laughs, great dancing, great music and lyrics. What more could I ask for? Why the missing DVD, of course! PLEASE!!! I keep checking Amazon, yet still I wait. I am getting old! DAMSEL IN DISTRESS on DVD please!!!"
2,"These post Ginger pictures are poor. No wonder he ""retired"".",These post Ginger pictures are way off track. How many did he make before he saw the error of his ways. Thank goodness he went with Judy Garkand in Easter Parade and had a second career. I love Fred but I will not watch this one again.
3,wish it was lighter...,"overall, great lip liner w/ good staying power but i just wish the color was a bit more nude. i bought the liner to use as a natural color w/ my sheerer lip glosses but it ended up being a few shades darker then my natural lip color. still great for use w/ darker lip sticks, but just not what i had expected."
5,Loving this musci,"Another Natalie Cole album I've been searching everywhere for and couldn't find. It is very clear, exactly like I remember when I was in college. I love it!!!"
5,Natalie Razzle's And Dazzle's Us,"This live set proves the lady can blow the roof off the house if she wanted to. I've seen Ms. Cole in concert many times and she always gave me goose-bumps with her ""Soul Bones"" performances. It's a down right disgrace that Capitol Records has only reissued one of nine albums the lady recorded for them. ""Unpredictable"" her biggest seller for the label still remains unissued on CD. Cole fans around the world are grateful I am sure for the cheesy reissues One Way Records did on Natalie less Unpredictable of course, the label wouldn't grant them the rights to the masters...Capitol Records you need to WAKE UP!!!"
2,Pretty bad,I love Sarah but the song selection in this album is awful and her voice does not sound very good singing pop and folk. Avoid it.
1,Terrible,I purchased this CD strictly on her connection with Bocelli. It was a waste of money. Listened to it three times and threw it in the trash.
4,"Not the best Brightman, but still better than most!","This album is so different from everything else Ms. Brightman's ever done, including its closest cousins ""Dive"" and ""Fly"". But, that's not a bad thing. This is almost a pure ""pop"" album, but it's one of the best of the genre I've ever heard. If you're looking for her opera-esque singing, buy ""Time to Say Goodbye"". If you want some trippy but fun songs by the Singing Angel, get ""As I came of Age""."
4,Palm Slim Leather Case,I enjoy my leather case for my PDA. It is very convenient and it makes me feel like my PDA is well protected.
4,Good for Zire72,Looks good and fits perfect with Zire 72. Extra slots good for carrying stuff. Only if they would provide an extra stylus with this....!
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,When I received this case for my Palm TX and placed my TX in it. Much to my suprise it didn't fit. My PDA stuck out and over the top and the screen was partially blocked by the leather strip on the top that helps hold the TX in. I would not recommend this case for the TX if you want to leave it in the case while working within the PDA environment.
2,Should have been better,The case looks lovely but if it is tipped the Palm Piolet could fall out. That's how I broke my last one when it fell from the case and crashed on The floor.
1,Bad bundle,"This case was bundled with the Palm TX handheld, so I bought them together. The problem is, the case doesn't fit this pda."
5,Great,"I love this case for my PalmOne Zire 72s. It fits great and it looks great. I also love the fact that on one of the side, it has 2 pockets for 2 more expansion cards and more pockets for credit cards, metrocards, or w/e. Love it and def. recommended! It looks like it should be more expensive than the actual price."
1,you sold me the wrong product to me,"You proposed to buy together the Palm TX and this slim leather case. The wrong one (too small, it jeopardizes vision fo the whole screeen). The right one is the 3176WW. I wrote to amazon suport a e-mail and I am waiting to get an email with instructions to the change.I am very disapointed with this mistake. Your site has induced me to make the wrong choice. Please send instructions to correct this issue."
1,Warning: it does not work with Palm TX!,"It's nice and small but do not buy it for Palm TX, it's too small. However if you have an old Dell Axim case it will work just fine (no offence...)"
1,disappointing doesn't fit my Palm TX,I looked up leather case for Palm TX. The case I bought was recommended. It is leather and handsome however: It does not fit the Palm TX. I cannot use it.
1,NOT compatible with Tungsten TX or T5,"After I ordered a Tungsten TX, this case was presented to me by Amazon, so I ordered it as well. After it arrived we found that it is too small for the TX (and I believe also the T5). You need a 3176WW Leather Case to get the right fit for the T5 or TX.My 1 star rating is for the misleading representation made for this case when I ordered it. There is no indication on the description page that it does not fit the T5 or TX. It is a perfectly fine case for the Palms that it does fit. Just beware."
3,OK BUT,"This case for the Z22 is OK if it is being carried in a brief case or handbag. BUT for a person on the move and wants his/her Z22 quickly there are better cases on the market, and I now have one."
2,Palm Z22 Lover,"I purchased this and within a couple of weeks purchased the Palm Z22 Every Day Case. I feel this case just didn't fit the Palm Z22 very well. It has slots for memory cards and the Palm Z22 doesn't hold memory cards. Overall, this case wasn't what I needed. I feel it is probably more suited for the larger Palm handhelds."
2,disappointed in case,"I ordered this 'slim leather case' simultaneously with a new Z22 handheld and the case is too big for the handheld. It slides around in it and the power on/off switch is effectively covered by the 'frame'. Also, the closure on the case really can't be opened with one hand (sort of a tab through a loop thing). So, I finally put the new unit into a battered old (4 or 5 years?) holder with a velcro closure and while it isn't nearly as pretty the handheld is unobstructed for use, safe and secure in the holder and altogether more satisfactory. I bought the new case because it came up on the 'side panel' of the site so I assumed (my mistake) it would fit the Z22 securely. It doesn't. Maybe one is offered that does fit it better without covering the power switch?"
2,Not the right size for Palm TX,"This is a nice case, but not for the Palm TX. It sticks way out at the top of the case."
1,BAD TX FIT AND ROUGH QUALITY,"This case was advertised as an accessory for the new Palm TX I purchased. But the case is too small for the Palm TX, the locking tab has to be forced through the loop to close the case, and the finish of the case is rough. I am returning it. It does not meet the standards of previous leather cases I have purchased from Palm and I was disappointed."
1,I wish i read the other reviews,I purchased this case as a package with the Palm TX from amazon. I wish I had read others reviews because as the others pointed out it does not fit the Palm TX. The top sticks out. I went to staples and bought the right case and was told the ones that fit the Palm TX have to say compatible with Tungsten T5. So Im not sure why amazon has a deal with the Palm TX when it isn't the right case. Another thing is it doesn't have a snap only a pull through strap which doesn't stay put too good.
3,leather palm case,It is a very nice looking protective case but the palm slides out too easy and can fall on the floor if not careful!
3,case returned,returned the casewhite stitching around edge looks very feminineseveral people had the same comment
4,Leather case review,"This is a very good product, sturdy, has a place to put business cards, etc...However, the one drawback is that it's slightly too big for dress shirt pockets. So if you're looking to keep it in your dress shirt pocket at work, this isn't the best product...I have a small palm and was disappointed that it was so large. Otherwise - a great choice, I've had no problems with the strap to close the case or having the palm fall out of the top as mentioned in some of the other reviews, and would definitely recommend it for the price."
2,Case doesn't fit the Palm Z22,I bought this case for my Palm z22 and it doesn't quite fit. The case is a little too big for the Palm and it falls out when turned upside down. I am going to make it work by adding some velcro to the back of the Palm and the inside of the case. Other than the fit (or lack of)this case is well made and a good deal for the price.
3,soft but narrow,"The cover is great in terms of leather and softness. I feel it's too narrow because the palm gets a bit covered by the pocket that holds it, and when you have to use the pointer, sometimes you don't get to touch the whole screen , and you end touching the leather case not the very extreme side of the screen and that makes the handling difficult."
2,Nice looking but doesn't fit correctly with the Z22,"I bought this as the Amazon-recommended case for the Z22. The price was reasonable and it looked attractive. The only problem is that it doesn't appear to be made for the Z22. There's nothing to keep the PDA from falling out if you turn the case upside down, you can't get to the on/off switch and it's bigger than it needs to be.I'm very happy with the Palm Z22- I just wish they had a nice leather case that was really made for it."
4,"Good, elegant case","I use this case for a Palm Zire and I am glad I got it. The leather feels nice and looks stylish. It adds very little bulk to the PDA and has slots for MMC cards and other papers.(I keep a business card, just in case it is lost.) It holds the device quite securely. I like the tab closure for style, though it makes it slower to open and close. For this reason, I give it 4 stars instead of 5."
4,"Zire 31 loves it, Tungsten doesn't","This case fits my fiance's Zire 31 well. The power button, the synch and power plugs are slightly blocked, but that is okay. It is snug and protects it well without being bulky.My Tungsten E juts out on the top and slides around a little. I wouldn't feel safe keeping it in this case."
3,Not for TX Palm,"Bought this leather case along with a TX Palm. The description should say that it would not fit the TX model but, too late, I open and find out the hard way."
2,Does not fit the Palm Z22,"I recently purchased the Palm Z22 from Amazon and I also purchased this leather case ""Because Amazon said it works with the Z22"". Well, guess what...the Palm Z22 is too small for this case. You have to be very careful when holding the Palm in this case or it will fall right out. Not a safe way to protect your Palm. So if you are looking for a case for your Palm Z22, look else where."
1,just for the first time,when i got the item i was so happy because it fits on my Tungsten and give it a more presentable look. but after few days it started to tear of it skin and loose the shining appeal of the leather. Now it looks so old and damage.seems i bought it 3 years ago
4,good looking case,"I ordered this product because I was having a lot of problems with my Palm Zire 31. I had to call customer service a lot and was just about ready to throw my Palm through an open window driving 70 mph. Before I did that I decided that I would buy a case to see if that would help with the problems I was having. I lloked every where for cases. Finally, I found this one.The pros are:it was priced rightI like the colorIt is not too heavy yet still feels like it is tough enough to protect my Palm.My Palm does not slide around in it.The cons are:no choice in colorno personalization optionI hate the slots for cardsHard to charge my Palm while it is in the case.Immpossible to leave stylus in Palm and use it while it is in case.In short, this is an ok product, but I wish it could have been more. It does the job so yes I would recommend it."
3,Palm case,"Palm Slim Leather Case (P10985U)I found the case a bit more bulky than I expected, but I am using it."
4,"Does its job, good overall","Case is handy and holds the Palm fairly well. It could use some kind of top closure or clasp to keep the palm in place. The elastics on the sides hold the unit ok, but it tends to slide upward and needs to be re-adjusted frequently. Leather is good quality and will probably last a long time. Good use of space for accessories."
2,Do not fit with Palm TX,Amazon recomend me this Leather case for my Palm TX.. and did not fit on it... is tooo small....
3,OK,"It's hard to keep the palm fully in the csse. It tends to slide out the top. Otherwise, it is ok."
4,Well made great protection for my Palm,I got this for my new Palm 6 months ago and I use it every day. It has held up well and still looks brand new. The handy pockets inside are great for memory cards. The latch is a bit annoying at first but I got used to it. Nice sleek looking case.
2,palm case,I liked the quality of the case but the TX I have does not fit very well in it. You can not use the whole screen. The top of the palm is covered up.
2,Needs improvement,I was very disappointed in the case. I bought it for my Palm z22. It was not a good fit - too big. It needs something to keep the pda from falling out the top. A snap or velcro strap would be nice. The existing strap is in the wrong place. Do not recommend for the Palm z22.
2,"Cheaply made, poor fitting","The case itself is fine, it's just the all important slip strap that was cut a bit too wide to slide into the loop to close the case. You can try jamming it in, but why? It should just fit, no matter what the price. Particularly since this is a Palm product, I was counting on better quality than this."
2,Does not fit for the TX,When I bougth my TX this case was offered as an accessory. I bought it and does not fit for the tx. I can not use it
3,Nice looking yet not secure enough.,"I like it for its nice appearance, it's slim and elegantly designed. The only complain I have is that it doesn't secure the top of the PDA. My Palm Tungsten E slips out if I am not careful. I always make a point to secure the loop as tight as possible, but that doesn't really help."
1,Buyer Beware,"I made the exact same mistake these other Z22 buyers made. The case arrived a week or so before my Palm did. I was pretty excited and impressed about slim and compact it is. But none of that means anything if it is too large for my Palm. I'm disappointed with Amazon because I also bought it as part of a recommended ""bundle."" I wish I had read all the way down to the end of the reviews!"
4,palm case,"Love the case, except the elastic bands on the bottom want to push the palm up at the top."
3,Good fit for the Zire 31,I like this case alot. Its a good fit. I added velcro to back of the pda unit and to the case to make the fit more secure. also added velcro to the center stylus pocket and the end of the stylus because stylus would otherwise fall out. I think these modifications improved the rating to 4 star.
2,Not very protective,"I bought this case for a tungsten E2. When I hold the case upside down, my Palm slides out.Otherwise, the case is very nice. It has 3 slots for credit cards, 2 slots for memory cards, and a holder for your stylus. You can sync, recharge, or attach headphones without removing the case."
4,Palm Case,"Case is custom-made for the Palm PDA that I purchased. The PDA needs a case, and the custom-made case is ideal."
4,Nice!,"I mean, what can you say about a leather case. It was cheap, affordable and arrived ontime. It serves its purpose well."
4,Good protection for Palm,I miss a leatherstrap (or a similar solution) at the top of the case to prevent the Palm from falling out. I also would like more colors to choose from. We are women using it and sometimes we need to find it in a hurry in our handbags and elsewhere - the latter for both genders.Yours sincerelySidsel Flak Soerlie
4,Nothing fancy but it works,"Other than the pockets for spare SD memory cards this is a very simple case for the Palm, but that is exactly what I wanted."
1,Not for Palm TX,The description says that it would not fit the TX model but it doesnt! I opened it and found out the hard way.
1,I return it.,I returned this Item because it didn't filt my Palm Z22 at all. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE Z-22.
2,Not so good for the TX,"The TX will not fit right and It has a part on top of it that does not let you see the complete screen, it is recommended, but not for a TX."
3,Average,My Tungsten TX doesn't fit properly in here. The belt loop is fine but I am not pleased that about 1 cm of my palm sticks out at the top. It should be as securely fastened as the rest of the palm.
2,Doesn't Hold My Palm Z22 Securely,"When I bought my Palm Z22 at Staples, I talked the sales person into upgrading my case from a pretty flimsy generic to this one, thinking that it would do a better job of protecting my purchase.Wrong.The case does not secure the device into the slot - a good shake will cause my Palm to fall out.Additionally, the On/Off switch is covered by the leather frame.While I like the style, and the stylus slot, I'm going to start searching the web for something that will do a better job of protecting my PDA."
2,Does not fit the TX,"This leather case is too short to accommodate the Palm Tx...it is difficult to keep in the case because of this. Though the product itself is fine, it should not be paired with the Tx and I regret purchasing it."
1,wrong one for the Z22,"Amazon offered a ""buy both"" proposal with my purchase of a Palm Z22. This is the wrong one. The Z22 is too small and slips out easily. If you are going to make an offer to buy a case, please match it up correctly. I wrote to amazon suport a e-mail and I am still awaiting a return response.I am very disapointed with this mistake. Your site has lead me into making an incorrect purchase."
2,Be Careful of Sizing,This product implies that it is for all Palm Zire handhelds. This isn't true. It is too large for the Palm Z22 and should not be purchased for that handheld.
2,Does not fit the Palm TX,"I bought this item because it was recommended for the Palm TX, but it is not designed for the TX and it covers a small part of the bottom of the screen."
5,Good looking and work well,"These glasses work as well as they look. The straight back design grips your head without noticeable pressure and have little or no slippage even when covered with sweat. The compact nose pads keeps them close to the eyes reducing the chance of debris getting in from above or below. The lenses do scratch over time, but it took a solid impact to scratch mine. After I scratched up the 1st pair I was impressed enough with the quality, good looks and awesome price to buy another pair."
5,Are you having nightmares?,"Along with ""Coloseum"" (the greatest psychedelic LP of all time) these two LPs complete the essential Shockabilly trip. ""Heaven"" (my favorite of the 2) is one big bad acid trip, it is a truly frightening record full of noise, chaos and bad dreams. This is the sound of the end and if you can relate it might be your end. Vietnam is a slightly quieter (slightly) and more overtly political look at those things that interest Mr. Chadbourne. All in all a fantastic bargain at any price and a must own for any disturbed individual."
5,Fantastic Story - A Great Read,"I first read this story from my local library about ten years ago. I loved the story so much that at least once a year I would re-checkout the book so I could enter the world of Moloquin once again. Then just a month ago, I went to check it out again, and I found that my library had discarded my favorite book! I immediately got online and bought the book for myself! It will become a classic in time. For those who like historical fiction, this author is the very best!"
2,Best of not so best...,"I'm a big fan of Joe Cuba's music which is why I bought this Best of Joe Cuba Sextet, but this best of album released by Charly is not so great.The songs are of low quality (to the point of being muffled). They even went as far as trying to remix the original songs such as Bang Bang (one of my favorite Joe Cuba songs), which came out poorly. Advice to record distributors trying to make a quick buck with best of albums, don't mess with original classics. If so, then make it clear to the consumer and don't try to pass it off as a Best of album featuring classic ""originals"". Call it the ""Best of poorly done re-mixes done on the cheap album""."
5,Couldn't be better,"Love these bath salts, they make the bath smell great and look great and are are gentle on my sensitive skin. Good value too."
5,zombie goregrind madness....but with style,"Zombie's and goregrind go together like...well they go together. Its been done before by other bands but I think Gruesome Stuff Relish does it better than anyone else. The intensity and rythm is just unmatched. Plus, there's all the vomit bowel throwing up vocals you could want. Who could ask for more? With 30 tracks of gore grooving grind this CD never gets old. One of my favorites!"
2,Took a beating but kept on ticking. . . so far!,"The watch while undamaged looked as though it had been returned by a previous customer who tried to put it back in the original packaging unsuccessfully. In addition, the packaging was cheap. I have bought Timex watches for over 40 years ands have never seen one so poorly and unattractively packaged. Add to that the aforementioned fact that it looked as though it were used and this was not something you wanted to give as a gift. Very disappointed!"
5,Iguana fun fun,"I ordered this toy, it shipped out on the 27th, and I received it on the 29th. I am very happy with it. I bought it for my youngest daughter because my oldest already had one. She was very excited to find it in the mailbox! We were going to Vegas the same day it arrived, so she played it throughout the whole trip! I was so happy that she had something to do! This is a very age appropriate toy and it is very fun."
4,Age appropriate fun,This digital pet was bought for my daughter and also bought one for my nephew. These were stocking stuffers that would be from the kids Granny. They both have another pet from last Christmas and they were so exited to be able to put them together and watch them dance. Seems to be a really fun toy and it is age appropriate.
3,Everyone is close,"It certainly isn't their BEST as far as I am concerned, but I agree with the guy who said you dont want to hear the same stuff over and over.Their are a few songs such as Red, Right , Return that rock as well as Untreatable Disease and Taking back control. They do have a bit of U2ishness to this Album but I hate to think they Tried to do that.It just makes me want to see whats up after this CD. Cant wait to see them in a few days. If you have NEVER heard a Sparta Cd, maybe buy Wiretap Scars first, but this is Worthy for sure."
4,I forgot how much I enjoyed Sparta,"Great album. Wiretap Scars still remains my favorite (of Sparta, not the original band). Until I picked it up the other day I had forgotten how much I enjoyed listening to them. I've read a lot of bad reviews about Threes and most of them seem to center around the fact ""they're not like they were in the first album"". Who the hell wants the same album over and over again? There are plenty of mainstream artists out there that follow that trend if that's what you're after."
5,Pictures and poems,"A wonderful, multifaceted, book from a truly talented man. I especially love the poems, they keep making my mind go dizzy in a good way. I've never owned an art book before, and this was a great choice for my first one."
2,Coincidence of Celebrity,"I concede that the author has come up with some interesting photos/paintings as well as poetry. I was at first excited when I saw a few images from Miyelo, his latest book of photography. However when I browsed it in the bookstore, I found I couldn't justify buying it. It just wasn't that great.I wonder really if he weren't a ""movie star"", would Mr. Mortensen be so readily embraced or celebrated as a writer or an artist? Certainly I don't begrudge him from seeking out other forms of expression that are more restorative than the film industry. But I know many anonymous painters and writers who are far far more original and every bit as good, if not better. They aren't conventionally handsome or beautiful.And they aren't celebrities."
1,Coincidence of Memories,"This book is definitely NOT a coffetable collectable! I found it lacking in professionalism of photography, tasteless in ""poetry"" and the paintings garish collages. The photos with red lines obliterating half the picture are amateurish. I showed this to a photographer who looked & was not impressed. The ""poetry"" has no form, cadence, rhyme or rhythm and is vulgar in nature. Sorry, but this book will not be part of my collectable books."
4,Why i bought this book,"I bought this book , as i'm a fan of Viggo, the actor ,and had read and seen some of his work on the internet and was very curious to see more.The book has wonderful , high quality photos,examples of Viggo's art,( the collages are great) and poetry( un-rhyming) that Viggo has written over the years, which i admit had to read a couple of times to understand it, but overall thought the book was worth the money, especially as i bought it from Percival Press , through Amazon.com rather than Amazon.co.uk, as it was triple the cost price over here in England.I would highly recommend this book,and the Percival Press for their excellent service!!"
2,One unfortunate work,"Featuring Roy Kenner in vocals and Dominic Troiano in guitar, this recording isn't satisfactory. Troina's guitar is interesting and clear, but it doesn't obtain Walsh and Bolin level. I still prefer Joe Walsh's funny and limited, but fashined vocals. Kenner sounds powerful though tasteless, nevertheless this disk contains some great and superb tunes. I recommend it to fans only."
5,A must read for all Indians,"JAYA BACHCHAN gave a wonderful gift to hubby dear on his 60th Birthday - the book To be or not to be Amitabh Bachchan.The book is wonderfully written and presented, full of rare pictures. The critical analysis of the Big B's career, and the open-heart flowing Interview are the key highlights of the book. The sections written by Abhishek, Shweta and Jaya are also quite impressive.An absolutely ""must read"" book for every Indian considering the status of our most loved icon ever. For all die-hard Big B fans, this book is surely a collector's item."
5,My favorites !,I just love them. I use them a lot. Considering the high heel they are very confortable.
3,JAMES GANG PASSIN' THRU,"THERE IS SOME GOOD MATERIAL AND FINE MUSICIANSHIP ON THIS RELEASE,BUT THIS IS NOT THE ""JAMES GANG"" WITH THE LIKES OF JOE WALSH AND TOMMY BOLIN. ROY KENNER AND DOMINEC TROIANO ARE BOTH CAPABLE ON VOCALS AND LEAD GUITAR RESPECTABLY BUT THE CD LACKS THE DRIVE OF THE ORIGINAL GROUP. NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS EDTION OF ""JAMES GANG"" WAS NEVER ACCEPTED BY FORMER FANS."
4,Zizi Possi's third album... nice!,"This 1980 release is one of Brazilian vocalist Zizi Possi's better albums. Although some of the instruments and stylistic affectations are rooted in post-disco era cliches, Joao Augusto's arrangements remain fairly simple and understated. More importantly, Possi's voice is quite lovely, and her presentation is refreshingly direct and restrained. This marks the start of her long association with Augusto as producer/arranger, and remains one of the high-water marks of that collaboration."
4,It works,"It's easy to install but it has lots of requirements. 5 feet about ground, in direct sunlight, distance from house etc.I made a video review but it's on YouTube cuz uploading on Amazon is a pain.[...]"
4,Flies Be Gone Fly Trap,It works great....the only problem I have is that I have a major problem with little flies (almost like gnats or fruit flies) and this does not seem to get them...I am very frustrated and have tried other products...do you have any suggestions? Linda Stevens (Linir49er@sbcglobal.net)
5,Really does what it says,"We had fly problems in our backyard and it didn't help that our dogs did their thing out there. The first day we installed this, we had only 2 flies and 4 days later, the entire bag is disgustingly FULL. My theory is that the more dead flies are in there, the smellier it is and the more it attracts others. We might be bringing all the flies in the neighborhood to our backyard but, bottom line, this trap really works!"
1,Disappointed - All Hype,"I am really disappointed with this product. Unfortunately I bought four of them. They actually caught less flies then the ones I buy at the dollar store. They hardly worked at all. Save your money, ad is mostly hype."
3,"Great product, but there are cheaper and comparable stuff out there.","I have great results using the Flies be gone fly trap. It took a couple of days to activate, but once after that it can traps inches of flies. However, I've tried a similar product from RESCUE (which is available at local hardware stores for only $5.00) which also worked as great. Maybe I have too many flies to begin with, which makes it impossible to separate the good from the excellent, but with the local availability and 1/3 of the cost, the other product wins hands down for me."
3,Flies Be Gone trap review,"For myself having used those smaller Rescue fly traps around my barn, I found this trap no more effective. Sad to find out considering the price."
2,Buyer beware!!!,"I ordered 4 of these in March. I had used ""Flies Be Gone"" before and it's a great product, but when these showed up it's actually a cheap knock off product called ""Flies Away"". It's nearly identical, except for the bait. ""Flies Be Gone"" (which works) includes a bag of powder bait (probably the worst smelling stuff I ever smelled in my life). This product showed up with a small tube of liquid bait. I was hoping for good results because the liquid is actually a lot more convenient.I put 3 of these traps around my property. After 3-4 weeks not a SINGLE fly was caught in any of them.I bought 4 of the ""Flies Be Gone"" original traps from a different vendor and hung them directly next to the other one, and within a day they started filling up with Flies.Rated 2-stars rather than one due to (a) the product advertised is excellent (it's just not the product that showed up), and (b) Amazon's customer service stepped up refunded the full purchase price."
2,Big Disappointment,"This product looked so promising,especially after sifting through the reviews. Product arrived quickly, but upon opening & filling with water, the corners of the bag were leaking! The plastic bag is extra-cheap/thin. I would've given 1 star, but I gave 2 Stars because an hour after I fixed the bag's corners & put it up, I had already caught 3 flies (also seemed promising). Within the first 24 hours, the bag came unattached from the yellow lid & dropped to the ground, dumping its PUTRID smelling contents in the yard that the dogs tried to consume. This was a terrible waste of money."
1,WARNING this is not the original product but some cheap knockoff,"This is not the same product we bought last year. It was so cheaply made that after we filled it with water and hung it up, it came apart and the plastic bag with the liquid in it just fell in the yard."
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this item in preparation of a backyard barbecue. I followed the direcdtions to a ""T"". I was impressed with the contstruction of the item. After having the bag hung for 48 hours, I still did not see one fly. I allowed the bag to hang in my yard for 10 days...still nothing. Not one fly. I disposed of the product by filling it with dirt and tying it up in a trash bag. I replaced this trap with the Sterling (Rescue) Fly Trap. I had a fly inside within 30 minutes of hanging. It has been hanging in my yard now for just over a week. The amount of flies in the trap is overwhelming. This trap really works! It smells horrible, but it works!!!"
1,Cannot catch a single fly!,"This product doesn't work at all, cannot catch a fly! It's also too expensive! Should look for another fly killer! I will never buy this product again! Too disappointed!"
1,Cheap imitation knock-off of original product,"Buyer beware!! This product is not Flies Be Gone. It is a cheap knock off imitation named Flies Away. Of the 3 traps I purchased, one had a hole in the bottom of the bag. The second broke within an hour of filling the bag. The plastic bag separated from the yellow top. The third trap seems to be okay but it is only the first day. This listing should be taken down as this is a fraudulent listing. NOT THE PRODUCT BEING ADVERTISED!!!"
5,Best fly trap!,"We bought it thinking it was not going to work but this one amazingly DOES its job, less flies everyday, I would greatly recommend it."
1,the product is a fake,"This product does not work at all, it's a joke advertising is misleading, the bags were damaged Product was repaired and mounted a pair of these traps and flies were laughing does nothing"
5,Best fly killer,This is the very best fly trap we have ever used. It keeps our farm fly free. I would recommend it for anyone who has livestock.
3,Dont blink you might miss something,Who would think a kid with the worse hair cut in the world could be so wanted by the females. Make sure you have your mind totally on the movie you might miss one of the many weird little scenes that crop upDid I enjoy it Yes the cinematography is below parr but over all its a good story
4,Not one of his best works,The story line was slow and held no surprises. Just a kid becoming a man. Well its more like a kid in a candy store after he finds he has the key to the store.
3,Bawdy & Fun,"You cannot take a movie like this very seriously of course... it is only about sex and pretty young people, and abandons any pretense of being about anything else. More movies should go this route, instead of posing with a brittle artsy front like the recent French film, ""The Dreamers"", that could have been oh-so-sexy, but digressed into insipid melodrama with the neurotic lead female and her brother.This film is just fun, following the sexual shenanigans that take place at a rural French country estate. Expect very attractive young ladies and a naughty script that dares to go almost everywhere. Do not expect wit or anything profound or moving. This is probably more of a ""guy"" movie. Uncork a bottle of French wine, press Play and enjoy."
4,A Boy's Dream Summer-done by David Hamilton,"A teenage boy is left on a farm during the war when all the men have gone. There are females of every age who are desiring a male's company-any male. The boy finds himself much desired. However, he has a crush on an older teen girl who doesn't seem to like him too much. He has difficulty dealing with this, and all the other attention that comes this way. Since this is a David Hamilton work, there is nudity, but not as much sensuality as his other movies."
3,Surprised,I thought the story was in good taste and well made. I would like to see more of Hamilton Movies. I was glad that the story was not field with a lot of porn.
4,Fairy Tales,"I had first known of Medtner's music when my piano teacher played one of the fairy tales for me. I only thought it was okay, because my teacher was by no means a virtuoso. Then I saw a video of Marc-André Hamelin playing Fairy Tale op. 26 n.1 and I was hooked. I've learned that piece now, and I play it every day. The only thing about the book I don't really like is the binding. It's bound like a paperback book you'd buy in a store, which makes it difficult for the book to stay open on the stand when you're playing. In fact, I wish all music books could be bound like the Alfred Masterwork editions of Chopin's music. Those are easy to open, and they stay open. Anyway, I'd highly recommend this book, if only for the music."
2,Not That Great...,"I was drawn to these by their price, something that should never be done with electronics. They don't sound very full, nor do they get anywhere near loud enough, barely above a good 'mixing' level. Save your money and buy something a litter more expensive with better quality."
3,Average headphone.,"It's an average headphone, no crap but no fancy. Extra long cord is a big plus. Quality is good but I feel very itchy after a long use."
3,Identity of the piano player?,"I watched part of this fun film on TCM early this morning, and missed the opening titles. Was Oscar, the piano player, Oscar Peterson, the well known jazz musician? He had a speaking role, unusual for a Black actor/musician in 1943."
2,hole punch,"it did not cut like i thought it would, their was a review that said it cut through a thin tin container so i figured it could cut through three thickness's of material it doesn't now i still have to find something else"
3,Descent Punch,"The punch is ok. I was expecting more for the price. Punching more than a couple pages is difficult with this punch. Also, it doesn't punch laminated papers very well."
4,Great product!,"This unit works great! The size is perfect for my needs (about the size of a pencil eraser.) Unlike those cheap whole punchers, you won't have to worry about the little pieces of paper falling out and getting everywhere.The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because I have another Fiskars punch that has a much nicer grip on it that this one. I was expecting just a little more."
3,Dingleberry,"Well as much as I love Happy Hardcore, this cd didnt really do it for me. All the songs are songs that I have heard before, but they seem as if they were redone or something... plus the cd is not mixed. Oh well can't win them all, overall a fine selection, upon closer look theres much better out there. Now lets go make some pot pie and call it a night."
1,Not Good,If you're looking for something along the lines of the Happy 2b Hardcore series you will be disappointed in this CD set. I couldn't find one decent tune on either of the two discs. Waste of money--I'd be willing to sell it for a dollar to anyone who wants to take it off my hands.
5,Brilliant and painfully convincing,"Kolodny explores every angle of the pressures facing faculty, students and administrators, and misses nothing. She has some splendid suggestions for hewing a path of the mess, too."
1,Kolodny's advocacy of speech codes borders on fascism.,"Annette Kolodny uses this book as an opportunity to advance her already infamous advocacy of speech codes, which ought to be called what it is: illiberal, intolerant, and bordering on fascism. With friends like these, the professoriate doesn't need enemies. What also speaks volumes is that this book is published by Duke, the home of that high priest of PC, Stanley Fish."
1,This book is pretty sorry,"I would have given it 0 stars but th lowest number of stars that you can give is 1. The reason that I did not like this book is because it says that you will find out the secrets to drawing the characters, but the truth is, there is no secret, it is so simple. I mean, everything is simple!!. So all in all, from homer to hans moleman, my reveiw says that if you are a little kid, you might get this book, but only if you are a super duper drawer, and anyone older than 10, it would be a waste of your time."
4,good,"This is a very good basic book on how to draw Simpsons characters, including motion and emotions. It's relatively small, but complete as is."
2,Not what I expected,"I received the product in a timely manner, however it was not what I expected. I thought I was getting video of live performances, and what I got was videos that I could have watched on cable."
1,my review,"I was not happy as I would have like to see live acts not video. I also wish they had put all the acts that were on the C.D. The dvd was cut to 17 acts,and it was not what I had expected."
5,Good Batteries,These batteries last for as long as alkaline batteries. they recharge in 15 min in our quick charger. I would never go back to normal batteries.
2,Don't last through many recharge cycles,"These batteries are not very good at all. Even when used with a good charger, they simply don't have a very long life. I use them in a Canon digital camera, and after one or two shots, they start taking longer and longer to recharge the flash. Now, I take them right off the charger, the camera flashes the ""low battery"" sign, and they take 10-15 seconds just to charge the flash. The batteries that came with the charger (a La Crosse) last longer per charge and haven't worn out like these have. I'll never buy Duracell rechargeables again."
1,Junk! Don't buy.,"Pure junk. Could not be charged at all. It's as if they were empty. I tried three different chargers to be certain, and not one of these eight batteries charged up.That is a horrible amount of money to loose for some of us. Duracell has no excuse to miss this kind of garbage."
1,Batteries and charger are just plain awful.,"I bought these batteries about 2 years ago along with the ""Duracell Rechargeable ACCU 15 Minute Charger"" that the batteries came with. They claim to last hundreds of charges before being depleted. Within 6 months, one by one each battery either A) would die in a few hours (I'm using them for my Xbox 360 controllers) or B) Won't recharge at all anymore on the docking station. Now I'm down to my final 2 that will even recharge and I basically have to recharge them once every 3-4 days. And I don't even play my video games that much! I'd say about 5-6 hours a week.I'm shocked Duracell, such a long lasting, reliable company, would make such a shoddy product."
1,These batteries suck!,"I will never buy duracell NiMH again. I bought a 4-pack awhile back and only 2 of them seems to even hold a charge. I thought maybe I had a few bad batteries so I decided to buy another 8-pack duracell NiMH, and again these batteries do not seem to hold a good charge. I even have one battery reading bad when I charge it with my Ansmann Energy 16, and the other 7 was low on charge. I decided to only go with Sanyo Eneloop now, Eneloop version 2 is coming out in Japan on Nov. 19, 2009."
3,Good batteries but they lose charge quickly when not in use.,"They work for the most part. Sadly they lose charge when not in use rather quickly, which is a big turn off. Also, they don't work at all with my digital camera which is a big shame."
2,"Good batteries, if they can hold their charge","I've bought either of these (green and black label) , none of them seem to hold their charge well. Voltage will drop below 1.3 V after just a week or so. Waste of money. The older Energizer 2500 mah batteries I got hold their charge much better."
1,quality is random at best,"About a year ago I purchased 16 of those with a duracell brand charger and they worked pretty well for remote controls and kids' toys that mainly makes sounds (i.e. not a huge power drain). The duracells do self-drain a little faster that I expected but I didn't find it a huge hassle.In June 2009 I decide I need another batch so I bought another 16. The new ones are horrible! I charged them 2 weeks before use and I was surprised to find none of them had enough to even power a PS3 remote control. I have a travel size shaver that takes 2 AA's which I use 2 days a week and those new duracells couldn't even last 2 consecutive weeks.I wish someone can tell me I'm doing something wrong to the batteries but chances are they just suck. Numerous cycles of recharge followed by immediate self-drain make me give up on them, now it's more than a hassle to bother using them."
2,Lose their charge very fast,"Don't waste your money on these, I bought 2-pks of these in Feb, 2009 based on some favorable reviews posted here. Once I received them and charged them up with myLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery ChargerI noticed that about half of them lose their charge after sitting unused for a week or two.Go buy some SANYO eneloops instead."
1,Dont waste your time,"I have about 12 of these. lemme tell you something first off. If you plan to use batteries very frequently, they will do. but i left for a week on vacation and i come back only to find ALL my batteries are dead. Now i have to wait 16+ hours just to do a few things that i should've been able to do immediately. i recommend to have a few backup packs of alkaline handy before buying these."
1,weak performer,"I bought these as an addition to many other rechargeable AA batteries. I have had bad luck with them so I just tested them in my lacross bc-900 charger and they came up with 650-850 mahr capacity (2650 mahr rated). fully 1/3 or the rating. I have many older AA's that work great and hold up for years. I never fast charge and occationally run the conditioner function on them.for some reason, these are not holding up.I just bought a bunch of eneloops. we will see how they hold up."
1,"Duracell NiMH cells are hit and miss, at best","I have been buying rechargeable AA batteries since the days of NiCd cells. I have purchased many brands, including Energizer, Maha Powerex, Kodak, Sanyo Eneloops, and Duracell. All degrade slowly over time -- except some Duracells, which are prone to sudden and irreversible failure. I charge with Maha chargers, including the MH-C9000 which can also recondition and analyze. Several years ago, I bought ~20 of these Duracells. Fully half of them no longer hold a charge.I have many Energizer, Powerex, and Kodak cells that hold nearly their rated capacity for far longer than two years. To have 50% of the Duracells fail in this timeframe has convinced me to never buy a Duracell NiMH battery again. Ever."
1,Dont hold the Charge,"A total waste of money. I bought 8 Duracell rechargeable batteries from this vendor(NY Electronics). The batteries do not hold the charge. If the camera has not been used for a week or so and I pick it to shoot something interesting, it is so disappointing and frustrating to find out that the batteries are absolutely dead. I am reporting this to the Duracell Company."
1,Discharge without use within a few days,"I bought these batteries as replacements for a set of NiMH batteries I had bought a few years ago at Radio Shack which had finally reached end of life. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the batteries I had just retired held a charge longer than these! I cannot understand why any company would manufacture a product as worthless as this. I first thought that my digital camera had developed a defect which caused the batteries to drain within only 3-5 days. However, the same effect occurs in other devices or even if I just store them. I was impressed by the claimed capacity of 2650 mAh but what good is that capacity if you have to use it all within a few days? Don't waste your money on these!"
1,TERRIBLE BATTERIES,"The first batch of these Duracells that I bought were pretty good. Then I bought a bunch more on eBay and they were absolutely crap. I can't even take ONE picture with my little Canon camera. I press the power button and there's not enough power left to retract the lens back into the camera! And all of this done with batteries fully recharged right out from the Duracell 15-minutes charger.I fell cheated. robbed. No more Duracell for me, period."
1,Worst NiMH Batteries I've Ever Purchased,"I'm a big believer in rechargeable batteries and have purchased many brands. I've never had such bad luck as with Duracel NiMHs. After 2 of the first 4 batteries that I tried wouldn't hold a charge at all, I contacted Duracell, who sent me a replacement pack. I had better luck with the replacements, but I can still count on these to last half the time of any of my other NiMHs. I've tried refreshing these batteries with my La Crosse BC-900, but that didn't improve the discharge rate.After trying a couple packages of Sanyo Eneloops, I'm hooked - that's all I'll be buying in the future!"
5,Rechargable Batteries,The battereries are very good and I was amazed that I received the order the following day from my order date.
1,DUDS... won't hold a charge,"Another bad review... please listen to us and AVOID these batteries. They worked fine for the first few charges, but now they won't run a basic AM radio for more than an hour before dying. Do not purchase!"
2,The 2650mAh's self-discharged too soon,"The Duracell 2650mAh batteries surprised me by being dead when I needed them (I thought they were ready and good for use). It's been only a couple of weeks roughly since I recharged the 2650mAh's prior to my attempt to use the batteries. The astonishingly fast self-discharge rate make the 2650mAh's impractical/inconvenient. I am discarding (properly) all eight of my Duracell 2650mAh batteries, and ordering more pre-charged batteries such as the Eneloop."
3,they die if you sore them for a long time.,I bought these for my DLSR (with extended battery mount). Sometime When I dont use my camera for say 15 days.. they die. after taking few Picture my camera die.I then used it with BT keyboard. Keyboard only lives for 10-15 days.I switched to eneloop they are best. I bought apple batteries and they are even better.
4,Duracell 2650mAH AA batteries - OK,"Hi,I recently tookRechargeable NiMH Batteries, 2650mAH, AA size, 8 batteries per pack DC1500and I am feeling ok with it...We went for a trip recently and with myCanon S5 IS camera...I am able to take (using 4 AA batteries) around 200 pictures.I expected more because it is 2650mAh, but I would say its fairly OKbecause the images are taken with a higher resolution (3264 X 1832) with a sizeof around 1.89 MB.So..I took two sets (8AA ) of the batteries...here.so, when one is empty after 200 pics, I had an option to use the other one immediaetly...."
1,I'm Not buying anymore Duracell's,"I bought the one on the picture (black and green) and after just a little over 3 months they don't hold the charge for half a day Horrible! i've even have a good charger it's the La Crosse Technology BC-700.But the Tenergy pre-charge bought at the same time still working fine, this is really bad, now i'm going to try theSanyo Eneloop or the Powerex AA 2700mA.Hope this helps"
1,My 2650mah batteries all went bad,"All of my Duracell 2650mah batteries have gone bad.I have other Duracell batteries I bought before I got the 2650's and they are still going strong. I use a high quality charger so it's a problem with the batteries for sure.If you buy these batteries, make sure you have a long warranty and a good return policy!The only batteries I buy now are eneloop AA and AAA since they their charge for a much longer time than any other battery I have found. I have to charge my Duracells the night before I use them, the eneloops I can charge the month before and the eneloops are still fully charged! The duracells lose their charge quickly."
1,2650mAh Overheated and hissed while it sat on my desk,5/28/10While sitting at my desk I heard a hissing sound and found the Duracell leaking a gas. I wrapped it up in a sock and threw it outside. The battery was very hot.I've had the Duracells for under a year and These batteries never really held a charge for long but was good enough for the convenience. I emailed Duracell today to see what they want to do about the faulty battery. I have 12 AA and 4AAA.6/4/10 Duracell has yet to contact me. The problem has been reported to them so if someone gets injured by their batteries they have failed to follow up on a potential problem.
2,Some don't hold a charge,"I had bought two sets of these as the ""4-pack"". Sadly, half of my batteries don't hold a charge. Since I have the La Crosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Charger, I can check the current voltage of the batteries. After brief usage, some batteries still had high voltage, while others had completely run out!! Consequently, I don't use the ones that don't hold a charge (and the others work just fine). I own many other brands of batteries, but these are the worst. I think the Rayovac have been the best."
1,Can't hold a charge,"These batteries looked like exact replacements for my digital camera. The original batteries worked great!!! These will not hold a charge evensitting on the shelf. I charged all 8 batteries before a family event, and took several pictures. A week later, we had more family over and took a few pictures. Then, the next day, the batteries were dead. I replaced them with another set (recently charged), and was able to take TWO pictures before they were dead. I put in a third set (recently charged),and they were dead immediately :-("
2,Not a good choice for a camera flash,"These are absolute garbage for photography. I read the user reviews about the long shelf like and liked the high capacity rating, but my experience has been the opposite in the 3 months or so I've had them. It seems like they can't hold a charge for even a week, after an overnight charge. I bought them for use in a Canon 430EX II Speedlite and often times find that my flash is useless because the batteries are dead. I'll try the Sanyo Eneloops of Panasonics next time."
5,Best rechargeble batteries,This is the best rechargeble batteries I have come across by far. It keeps charge much longer than Energizer. I have done 500+ pictures with a Canon A95 camera on one charge.
1,"My memory: Long, Duracell's memory: Short","I'm a semi-pro photographer with experience in the field and when it comes to trust, these batteries don't have mine.I've always liked regular Duracell batteries better than any other but after a few months of regular use, my 2650mAh with 15min quick charger haven't held up. After a full charge, I can expect to get a solid run out of them (250 photos, 1/4 of them with flash) from my Canon A710IS, but leave those batteries sitting in the camera for a few days??? I fully expect them to be dead. I agree with the other 1 star reviewers. Too bad. I won't give up on Duracell though. I'll just be patient, though I have heard good things about Sanyo's Eneloop batteries."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have used alkaline Duracell batteries for years and have always been satisfied with their quality. Recently I purchased a number of these rechargeable NiMH batteries and have been sadly disappointed. They won't hold a charge! The only way that I have found them usable at all is to take them from the charger and use them right away - otherwise they are dead before they get started. Sorry, Duracell, but you have really hurt yourself - and your faithful customers - with this poor product. Even though I have a number of these and they have been used almost not at all I will likely toss them out and buy some other brand that will work when I need them."
3,It's a battery,It's fine. I use them for my Canon Speedlites. I do notice it takes a LOT longer to charge these than my other batteries so I just make sure to charge them day before I start my other batteries. But overall they are fine for what they are.
1,The WORST of the rechargeables.,"I purchased a high-end battery charger (Lacrosse)and of the 3 different brands of batteries that I use, these are by far the worst in terms of how long they hold the charge. I fully charged two of them 3 days ago, and just put them in a Logitech mouse. Immediately got a warning that the battery level was ""critical."" Never again!"
1,HR6 DC1500 These are junk batteries,"These are the junk HR6 DC1500 which only hold their charge for a brief time. After 10-15 days storage, they will be completely depleted. Use these the same day they are charged for full capacity."
2,Too Fat,"If these are the batteries with the green labeling, I cannot recommend them. Electro-chemically they seem fine, and hold a good charge for a long time, but the batteries are just a little too fat to fit most of my AA devices. I have to conclude they do not meet AA mechanical specs. So I have to use the competing brand for most of my equipment."
1,16 of 16 won't hold a charge longer than a week,"I purchased 16 of these pieces of junk (green top, no gold) about 18 months ago, and every single one can't hold a charge longer than about a week or ten days. They seem to work more or less OK if you just need batteries that work for a day or two, but it's an absolute must to leave them in the charge up until the moment they're needed. Stay away if you can.*Edit:To Duracell's credit, when I complained in their comment section of the website, they sent me coupons for replacement rechargeables, which I used to buy some of the ""precharged"" (low self-discharge) ones. I still say to be careful about these, but Duracell stepped up and if you get stuck with a bad batch like I did, you might have similar results."
5,+5 hours in guitar heaven.,"This is one of the best music dvd's I've purchased in my whole life. I've always been a fan of Mr.Haynes & Mighty and this two disc set is priceless if you're into blues-rock guitar. The audio and video quality is outstanding and the songs are amazing. A few songs are present in both discs but these are different interpretations of the tracks showing the evolution of the Mule over a span of two years.Mr. Haynes (I can't help feeling a sense of reverence when I mention his name) is himself larger than life, and if you're a guitar player you'll appreciate the chance to see excellent camera closeups on his hands performing wizardry on the fretboard,and eventually figure out some of his distinctive techniques and approaches to blues-rock.Totally worth buying. The first thing I did after I watched the two dvd's was to back them up.Tip for caring wives: If your man likes this type of music, this makes for a great gift. He will love it!!"
4,Consistent Mule ...,"After all the stuff written about poor sound quality when this came out, I was hesitant. The second version got the sound straight; the reslt is two great Mule shows, without the usual revolving door of guests. If you like the Mule, you will like this set."
4,Entertaining good music,"I bought this and didn't review it at 1st, I've since watched it again and it's really good live music, it's pure Gov't Mule at its best. They are a tight band, and simply don't buy it if you want somebody else."
4,explicit!,"video included on this cd, for CD-ROM.Explicit!Two attractive lesbians play around on a bed for 'Plug me in'."
4,"If you find this, do the right thing!","I must add on to Hasbro's comments below - ""Dumbhead"" is incredible! I have yet to hear the original, but I doubt it can touch the production-madness of Meek's. However, the women singing 'Dumbhead' (the Sharades) also do a song on the CD titled 'Boy Trouble', on which they go into vocal hysteria! It's as if they're trying to outdo the Proclaimers. I really do wish these ladies had recorded more. This CD is enjoyable and definitely worth having. Of course, not EVERY track will knock your socks off ('Let's Go See Gran'ma' will knock the boots though...you'll see), but that's to be expected. HIGHLIGHTS (in my opinion): 'I Lost My Heart At the Fairground', 'Hobbies', 'My Johnny Doesn't Come Around', & 'Please Don't Say Goodbye' - to name a few. Do pick this one up, you'll be glad you did."
2,For completists and historians only,"I just got this at a bargain price from Amazon.co.uk. Its great for completists and Meek collectors, and even for those who want to know about girl singers or production methods of the 1960s. But it's not very listenable. There are about four really good tracks on it, and no stars with the possible exception of Glenda Collins."
2,I probably should have left my memory alone!,"I loved this film when I was 9. Incredible howthe movie changed in 50 years! If you likedthis when it came out, keep your memory ofit intact and don't watch it again. Not muchof anything going for it."
3,"Cute, but it is what it is.",I have to admit I watched this because Tom Tryon was a friend and neighbor of one of my friends- and I had never seen him in a film- and was mostly curious how he would do. It was kind of cute- naive. There was very little chemistry with the girl- who was quite forgettable. I don't regret seeing it- it is amusing in its own way- and if you like old Disney screwball comedies it is fun if you don't expect much. Tom Tryon seems a little more intelligent than the film- and perhaps gives his role more weight than one of the typical actors they used in this genre. He seems like a good actor who is lost in a ridiculous farce and seems genuinely bewildered through much of it. One of these days I'll get around to seeing one of his more serious films or reading his books.
3,way below best items in the series,"The first 2/3 of the book are simply excellent, but the end is very disappointing to say the least, and the answer was pretty obvious from the beginning.And villains look completely improbable - it is hard to believe that a criminal enterprise in a relatively small town can stay in business if they kill their own associates left and right.Also, USSR was a pretty grim place on its own, there is simply no need to exaggerate it beyond all borders of believable: e.g. in the story we have a relatively regular criminal (burglar) who spent 40 years in the camps and before that he spent 3 years as a soldier in a penal batalion."
4,Much better than the last,"but... A motive that leaves the reader wondering how apt the phrase overkill is.A writer who can weave a spell, tho he still struggles from time to time."
2,Disappointing,"I originally bought a couple of the ""Reacher"" books after reading the one in which he was a MP major which I thought was great. In all the other books, he has apparently left the army so the reader doesn't get the inside scoop on army life. Without Reacher's fight against the army establishment as a backdrop, the various plots are lame."
5,Jack Reachers are addictive in the best way!,"But don't start with this one, start with 'Killing Floor' (the first in the series). It won't be long til you've read them all!"
4,Interesting story line,"Another great book in the Jack Reacher series, One Shot opens with an account of the murder of 5 people. It's clear from the start who committed the crime... but Jack Reacher quickly determines that things are not what they seem. Great read!"
3,"Plot 5, Action 5, Predictability 5, Excitement 2","This is Childs best plot, but probably least fulfilling novel.I found the action, of which there is plenty, predictable, and not written with the same brilliance that was demonstrated in say, the final acts of ""Killing floor"", or ""Die Trying"". if someone had said One Shot would all end at someones house in the back of beyond, for the final showdown, I would have said ""never !, not again, surely"".The whole story a little flat and lifeless, and I was hoping for the same peaks at troughs of excitement that the other books described in spades.I will still read Childs, but for his next book(s) I hope he works a little less on trying to come up with the 'perfect plot', and a little more on removing the formulaic nature of the action and story progression."
4,Child's writing kept me on my toes ...,Once again Lee Child has produced an extraordinary Jack Reacher tome. I had no idea what to expect. I had read the first few pages some time ago when it was at the back of The Enemy. It took me where I didn't think we were going and that is what I love about Child's prose. Going where you don't expect to go.
5,Jack Reacher: One Shot: A Novel,Very excititing read from beginning to end. It was a very good read and I thouroughly enjoyed it and recommend.
3,"Jack Reacher, by Lee Child","I enjoy all of Lee Child's books. Were it not for the terrible circumstances surrounding the Conneticut incident, I would have given it five stars. In retrospect, I can only give it three...sorry Mr. Child!"
4,Entertaining,"I had never read any Jack Reacher books before, and my interest was stimulated by the movie (which I ended up never seeing). I am picking this up mid-series, so a lot is already established, but I found it a fun, quick read, not too preposterous (except how do you cast the diminutive Tom Cruise in the movie!??!?)."
4,If you like Lee Child you will enjoy this book,Same as always. Reacher finds that bad guys and kills them. Very satisfying. It is a shame that they picked a dwarf to play the character.
4,One Shot,"Typical Reacher. Fact paced page turner, with lots of action. Good plot and well put together. I have enjoyed all of the series, with the exception of one or two, which I thought were a little too brutal."
2,ONE SHOT,This 9th book started off great but after that it was slow & very little action. I decided to finish the book just to see how it ends. I hope the 10th book is better.
3,"Good, but Not Great","I chose this novel because I've enjoyed previous Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child.I felt much of the descriptions were too long and drawn out and seemed to be just filler to lengthen the novel. Chapters are too long for most busy, working readers to pause reading conveniently. Otherwise the story line is interesting and worth reading."
4,Good not great,"I love the Jack Reacher series. I liked the way the book started although the end was a bit predictable. Wish I could give three and a half stars. I have not seen the new film with Tom Cruise, I have heard it's pretty good but Reacher should be six foot four. Maybe Tom's acting will carry it."
2,Empty and hollow,"I read the book because I was intrigued by the film. Well, it is nothing but an empty and hollow, cardboard-made model of the film. Jack Reacher (this is my first book) is a boring character, relying on others many times; otherwise, he is relying on his supernatural awareness of his surroundings (creating ridicolous situations). The good actors in the film, and the wonderful cinematography made this story alive, which is otherwise hardly worth reading."
4,Good read,Good read hard to put down a suspense thriller.Must read more of this series and watch the video. Intriguing
4,Pretty good book,I will definitely read the next as Reacheris an interesting concept for a character. I loved the ending as well...
5,Great book,I have read a lot of Jack Reacher stories--not all of them yet but I'm determined to get there. This book is one of the best I have read so far. I zoomed through it. Great plot.
4,"Book is Great, Cover Art is Wrong.","One Shot is a good book. Reacher is a great character. I have read all the Reacher books and enjoyed them immensely. My bone of contention is with the cover art. Tom Cruise is not and never will be Jack Reacher. His association with this character has created a dilemma: can I read another Jack Reacher novel without the Tiny Scientologist intruding on my visualisation of Reacher and spoiling my enjoyment? If I'm lucky. But it will take a great deal of effort, and Cruise and Child are responsible."
4,"""One Shot"" is a page turner.","""One Shot"" is another top notch story in this series from Lee Child. It is hard at to follow but author succeeds every time."
4,"I really enjoyed this particular ""Jack Reacher"" novel",This was a good read. I would certainly recommend it to those who have yet to read novels by Lee Child.
4,Jack Reacher - One Shot,Storyline is good as with all of Lee Child novels. Child's novel are all great. I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. Serious doubt about Tm Cruise play the p[art of Jack Reacher.
4,LIke Jack reacher,Read one or two newer Lee Child books and thought I would start at the beginning of the series. So I am working my way from 1 to whatever is latest.
4,Love the series,"Every ""Jack Reacher"" book has been an entertaining read. I did like ""One Shot', but some of the others in the series are even better. It could be that for the first time, I saw the movie, before I read the book. I must say the book was still better. Reacher is by character definition, the type of guy that can intimidate the crowd, just by walking in the door. This book had less danger, although the primary antagonist was very well written.I will continue to include any of Lee Childs books based on this character, as a great recommend for anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, or thrillers."
3,"Definitely not ""Chick-lit!""","I borrowed this book from my dad while on vacation. It was engrossing enough, the action never stops. But this is definitely a ""guys"" book. The characters aren't developed enough to establish a relationship with them, the violence is very graphic, and the sex seems perfunctory and expected. It was certainly an enjoyable book, but a little too masculine for this girl's taste!"
1,Tom Cruise???,I saw that there was going to a Jack Reacher movie and I was excited as I love this series. Then I heard that Jack was going to be played by Tom Cruise. How can a midget be cast as the the HUGE Jack Reacher? I am so disappointed. I certainly won't be going to see the movie. Oh well. The movie is never as good as the book. Which was great.
1,Not worth any money. Don't buy it,Reading someone's lists is not worth the amount paid. If this was entangled with a Jack story then it would work.
1,implausible ...,This author writes well enough ... but the plot lines are distinctly implausible ... a disappointment.
1,endless,"Not since Elmore Leonard have we seen so many pages totally devoted to meaningless dialogue. This novel has been truly ""Parkerized"" with its endless repetition in meaningless dialogue and pages of virtually no plot momentum. Lee Child has ""reached"" his level of incompetence."
4,"Best one since ""Killing Floor""","First... see my review of book one of the series. Second Ekval has written a fine review that I pretty much agree with. The suspense in this one is fine, but character development is lacking for most people. Even his girlfriend seems rather a shallow lover than a person I really understand and want to know more about. I had to really stretch to give this a four star rating. Child can do better, the talent for a ""deeper and more seamless"" story. Slow down and give us an award winner for Jack."
5,One Shot,"As usual a great book in the Reacher series.Highly reccommend it.The character is very interesting,and quite vicious."
4,Jack Reacher,"Jack Reacher is never dull. I have read several of the novels and always love them. They are getting a little repetitive. I can't wait to see the movie of this book, although I can't say I am happy with choice of Tom Cruise as Reacher. From a 6'5"" Reacher in the book to 5'9""? Cruise, believable???We'll see."
4,Very cool,"Very cool book, lets hope they dont screw up the movie by making it cheesy. This is a suspensful, and fun book to read."
5,Hold on Tight. You're in for quite a ride!,"We need a Jack Reacher in real life! This story had me almost cheering on my feet in parts (and I was sitting down reading the book). Jack is a no-nonsense, cut-through-the-garbage, get-to-the-bottom, clean-it-all-up and-set-things-right kind of guy. My kind of guy. I am always delighted to read of Jack's adventures, and this is a great one. I couldn't put it down, which irritated my co-workers to no end. I'm the boss, so tough apples. I continued reading anyway. Wonderful book, wonderful story, an exciting adventure that I hope is never made into a movie. Movies take away the reader's ability to imagine and replace it with someone else's. Who can frighten us better than ourselves. Give this book as a Christmas present to a very good friend who loves action stories. A great book!"
4,One Shot (Jack Reacher),"Five people die of gunshots as they leave work and the blame rests on a former military man trained as a sniper. The only person he asks to see is Jack Reacher. No one can find him, but not to worry for Jack is on his way to see the suspect. Jack happened to see the story on television and he's come to fulfill a promise he made the shooter, a man named James Barr.Jack soon realizes that there's more going on here and he decides to find out what it is. It puts him in danger as there are some nasty characters involved in this. It's a tale that keeps you on your toes and eagerly flipping pages to find out how Jack will get out the mess he's in this time. It's a good read, but I've liked a few of the other Reacher books better."
3,This is for the audiobook...,"...abridged audio-book, I guess, because the unabridged isn't out yet. I checked out the audio-book from a local library.The content--story line, Reacher character, and so forth, is great. So is the reader, Dick Hill, when he is just reading the book.The problem is when in the book a woman is talking. Instead of just reading what she says, Mr. Hill tries to imitate her voice. It doesn't work. Mr. Hill sounds like most guys do when they try to imitate a woman's voice: sarcastic, demeaning, annoying. REALLY annoying! Why this was allowed to stand in otherwise very good audio-book I do not understand.It would be better to get the Kindle version of the e-book and let your Kindle read it. You won't have a fine book spoiled by the sound of an amateurish attempt at a man imitating a woman. 2 stars off for that."
5,GREAT BOOKS,"""One Shot"" by Lee Child is to say the least suspenseful and exciting..pretty much like the rest of his ""Jack Reacher"" books!I recommend this book to anyone you likes a great story with everything in it!"
3,One shot,"Another good read, not my favorite Teacher story but an entertaining read that should translate to the big screen well."
3,Fast paced and exciting read as always.,Great read. Another great book by Lee child. I would recommend this as a must read. I can't wait for the teacher book.
5,So much better than the movie,"I've now read this book twice. I read it some time ago and when I found out that this is the book that they made the Tom Cruise movie ""Jack Reacher"" about, I read it again. Now most books are better than the movies they make about them so the fact that this one fits into the same category is no surprise. But Jack Reacher is such a great character, and his physicality is such a part of it, that the little Tom Cruise is just not up to the task! Anyway, this review is about the book, and like most of the Lee Child Jack Reacher books, it's just terrific."
4,Jack Reacher never disappoints.,I found the story unattached and confusing three quarters through while the characters' motivations were thin and not always credible. I love Jack because he is bigger than life so I will always recommend Lee's books.
5,Lee Child's One Shot,Lee Child continues to write page turners with One Shot. I have read 7 of the Reacher series and haven't been disappointed yet.
4,good book,"couldn,t put it down about half way through.i highly recomend it if you like action and suspence and some fighting and shoot em up book"
3,Jack Reacher (one shot),"Book was good but why did he let the movie be made, it tarnished the whole feeling of the story?????????????????????"
5,"Jack Reacher Is So Cool,","I'm a fan and this book didn't disappoint. Lots of twists and turns, Lots of thinking and deciding. I loved it!!!"
3,ONE SHOT,"GOOD READ! REACHER, IS JUST A LITTLE TO STRANGE. FROM HIS NO BAGAGE, TO THE WAY HE JUST WALKS AWAY AT THE END."
3,Fragmented,A good book but hard to follow at times. Needed to be tied together to really get the full rfeeling of it all.
3,Not the best Reacher Novel but acceptable,Wanted to read it before the first Reacher movie came out. Enjoyable read but not the best in the Reacher series. The movie was pretty good too...
4,One Shot,"Actually, the book is too predictable, however , it is a good story, and I really like Reacher. That's it."
5,ONE SHOT Review of Novel,"Great novel, much better than the movie. Movie was ok but Tom Cruise just can't be Reacher. Reacher's very tall and rugged. I'm a big fan of Lee Child."
3,"Characters not reponding, over and over and over.....",The idea of character not responding to each other is life like but this idea does not edify a book at all. Once is enough to say that Jack did not respond...said nothing. I just got tired of that being used over and over. And the lady who showed up long enough to have sex with Jack then is not menti oned again was not good move. Why not just high a prostitute if he cannot keep his pants zipped.
4,TERRIFIC REACHER BOOK!,Another great Jack Reacher book. This is one of the best of the series. If you like this then you should definitely check out Blood for Oil by Michael Kelley.Blood for Oil
4,One shot,Another successful jack reacher novel. It's light and easy to read particularly if you are a reacher fan and it's your first amazon kindl experience.
3,one shot by lee child,"This is a typical Reacher story, it makes you feel good that Reacher is there to look after his mates, however after the first forty pages you could actually decide what is going on and more or less know the outcome. But as always you feel comfortable that Jack Reacher will resolve the problems. I just wish he would get a case for his cloths. He must look terrible."
5,One Shot,"ONE SHOT (Pub. 2005) is Lee Child's ninth novel and my favorite book in the Jack Reacher series.What I like most is the intricately woven facets surrounding a 'who done it'. Lee layers interesting plot points with subtle but constant tension.Reacher is at his absolute best in this story. He's called into a heinous crime scene in a backwards way. The sniper arrested for killing six people in a public courtyard tells the cops, ""You got the wrong guy."" Then he says, ""Get Reacher for me.""'Reacher's reluctance to help the accused sniper is overshadowed by his certainty that something is not right. I love the way Reacher methodically and ingeniously unwinds the DA's airtight case.Lee manages to give us non-stop tension, an intriguing mystery along with a couple scoops of romance and some cool factoids while he makes Reacher fight and think in his classic Reacher way. Good stuff - go buy it!"
4,Jack Reacher - One Shot,"Very good plot, good character development, keeps you turning the pages. Reacher is a very unusual character, but one sharp cookie."
4,One Shot (Jack Reacher),"Very good book to read, I could not put it down. It was not to long or short I even took it to work to see what happened next."
4,Pretty good entertainment read,"It is a pretty fast, good read for entertainment. Chapters are a little long and there are a few holes in the overall story. Overall I would say it is worth the bucks and keeps you interested."
2,Tom Cruise? purlease....,"What are they thinking? Come on guys, you can do better than this. Zero credibility.Who's gonna be intimidated by someone in platform heels?"
5,CANNOT PUT DOWN BOOKS WRITTEN BY LEE CHILD,"I guess Mr. Child now has firmly implanted ""Jack Reacher"" under my skin. His novels are truly addictive. I just ordered 2 more and ""One Shot"" was another great read. I just wish he would write faster - I cannot wait for the next one....."
1,Another FAIL for Child,"Lee Child's books are like a trainwreck, they're so bad I just can't stop. Actually I do have to stop occasionally because I'm laughing too hard to read. This one is no exception. Gaping plot holes as usual. Why the heck had Chenko/Charlie been friends with Barr and going shooting with him for years? Just on the off chance he someday needed a sub-par sniper to be a fall guy? And a former Marine (not ex-Marine, Child, you nitwit) who owns and runs a shooting range and only owns one gun? Good thing he was a world-class shot so he could hit a bullseye at 300 yards with optics? Really? 300 yards?"
5,"The caring, compassionate Reacher","Who says he's a cold calculating killer? I think he's a complicated, caring and compassionate individual who runs into some pretty strange situations, but he's more than capable of dealing with what comes his way.Compassionate: When asking questions of a reluctant lawyer, ""Do you have medical insurance?""Caring: Still with the interview with the lawyer, ""Do you have a dental plan?""Capable: He brings a knife to a gun fight.Yes, Reacher won't disappoint the reader who's been with him through all the previous novels. This would make a good movie."
4,Great Scott! One Shot!,This is a real page turner...you will read this and get adicted to Jack Reacher! Highly recommend for a great summer read!
